The silly season 6km up a mountain, Verditz, Austria

Leaving on a jet plane!

2008-03-15 to 2008-03-16


Well... I have made it! After a few weeks of sickness, no travel insurance wanting to cover me (after my operation), no tickets from the travel agency, mum having to do my removal whilst I lay on the couch, the bad sister (yes, you Bern!) staying up all night to help me pack... i was finally on my way!! (thank you family!)

I think Friday was the worlds longest day ... flying to LA, then Lima, then Chile i think I saw more hours than I ever thought possible! I had lovely people to sit next to each time so that helped when none of us could sleep! I arrived in Chile about 5am on Sat and straight to my new familys house. Gladis (my Chile Mother) was very welcoming, even though she had no idea what I was saying and I was struggling equally to understand her muy rapido espanol! I also have several host brothers and sisters which is really nice and they know some english so can help out when I get really really stuck!

I have my own room in our apartment in Providencia, Santiago and it is a lovely area with lots of parks and little shops... and apart from the fact that all the apartment blocks are identical, besides a little number on the front! Needless to say I spent some time wandering in circles on the way home when I decided to go out for a walk!

The Chilean lifestyle is very laid back and very family oriented which is really nice. Breakfast is about 10, a big lunch around 2 or 3 or 4... and a snack for dinner about 8 or 9 or so... so late nights and early starts!

I missed our family outing to church for Palm Sunday today as my limited understanding of the conversation was that it was at 12... but no, it was at half past 10! Oops. They were very understanding though and I caught then next mass which was really really cool as all the congregation sang and waved their woven palm leaves to the songs.

I am having a great time...It is definately very very interesting, and more than a little frustrating and difficult at times, but my spanish is definately improving in leaps and bounds and there are awesome experiences living with the locals!! I start Spanish school tomorrow morning so looking forward to that!

Hasta luego!

 

 
Yo soy Chilana!

2008-03-17 to 2008-03-20


I thought when I wrote my last entry I was over my jetlag... but no! I struggled badly for the first few days at school but I think I have made it through now... even if i am soooooo on Chilean time! It certainly doesnt help that it isnt light until about 8am though and no one sleeps until at least midnight every night!!

But... my first day at school I left in the dark to walk for about 20 mins to begin my placement exam and then class! I am in a class with a guy from Sweden (Andre) and a girl from the czech republic (Helena) and that is it! It is a fantastic school and everyone is so friendly. The way the information is taught is so great too. It was like all of the sudden all of these things just fell into place in my head and my sentences sound almost normal... almost!

After class on the first day we had a lunch for new students and then off on an excursion to Barrio Bellavista and up the hill to San Christobel where there is the statue of the Virgin Mary and a view over all of Santiago and the Andes. There was a lot of smog around, but very interesting to see just how large Santiago really is! We caught the cable car down the mountain and the metro back to Manuel Mont, a street near the school full of shops and restaurants and bars for South American drinks (Mojitos!) before home for dinner with my host family.

Tuesday saw another great day at school and then off with Canada Rob, Swed Andre, Korean Kim and Belgium Jo to a cool little pub where we tried the traditional Chilean drink terremoto - translated it means earthquake as that is how you feel after you drink just one! It is wine and contrieu and who knows what else with pineapple icecream! way weird! But great fun as we made friends with the other Chileans around and spent all afternoon there attempting to speak spanish with them!! We also managed to try the traditional Chilean meals - un completo - which is basically a hot dog with everything you can think of! and - churrasco - which is like a hamburger, but with just an inch of thinly sliced meat!!!! ...yes, i certainly didnt get far through that one!!! We then stumbled across the remainder of the school in Bellavista and joined them for the evening! So loving Chile! Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the school and students are awesome and It is so safe you can even walk around alone any hour of the day or night with no worries at all... not that I make a habit of that of course!

The weather here is super super hot during the day and super super cold at night and the host home I stay at has this odd system where if you want hot water you have to turn the switch on 2 hours before to get it. Needless to say after getting up at 5am the first day to do this I was (not so) bravely facing cold showers from then on it!! Soooo cold! Wednesday in particular was frosty so lucky I had a walk to school to warm up! Another great class (although still muy tired and jetlagged!) and then off to visit my friends German Francesca, and New Yorkers Tatiana and Jennifer in the school house down the road from the school. I then walked home to drop my bag off and meet them, but after some miscommunication (in spanish of course!) with the staff at the school we thought we had missed each other and set off into town. I visited the plaza de arms and walked through downtown Santiago before arriving (via the scenic route!) at mercado central which is basically a massive fish market and huge set of restaurants attached to it where you then eat fresh seafood! I found the girls there and we had a lovely fresh fish lunch. It is actually quite weird to keep bumping into people from school seeing as Santaigo is actually quite large, but it is great! Franesca and I then walked through the lovely Santa Lucia park and to the santa lucia markets that are supposed to be awesome and a really big tourist destination. We didnt find much there besides the same thing in every shop! But had a nice stroll for the 40 mins or so back to Providencia.

Wednesday night we had a salsa lesson at the school in spanish by some spanish dance teachers which was so cool to be doing in Latin America!! We had a great night and then ate some crazy spanish food at a local bar before homework time!!

I am now an authentic Chilean too!! I can zing through the back streets to get places in half the time and ride the metro like the best of them! Muy fantastico! I can also almost understand people when they answer my questions too!!! woohoo!

Thursday was the last day of school due to easter and we began with an exam to move up to the next level of school. Andre and i both passed so good news as it is not actually that easy to do!!

After school and a farewell lunch for the people leaving this week, Fran and I headed into Bellavista to look at the house of the famous poet Pablo Neruda. Unfortunately it was a wait to get in so I had to head home as I was heading to a new house! I now live less than 3 mins walk from the school with a fantastic family. My new host mother is Monica and also her daughter and grand daughter live here, as well as two other students from the school from Switzerland which is really cool. I have a massive room with a double bed and tv, a lovely family who are happy for me to come and go as I please and who really help me with my spanish and ... hot water too! woohoo! Hmm...even if i did just discover i left my pyjames at the old house as I left in a rush! oops!

I had better sign off now as I feel I have written a marathon and I hope it makes sense as the keyboard is different, i cant find the punctuation marks and i am really tired!!! It is actually quite late as I have just returned from the theatre, watching a Chilean play - Arriba de la Pelota - with the school. I cant say I understod much of it at all!! But the costumes and music were muy interesante and apparantly it was a very funny send up of Chilean life.. Apparantly!

Thanks to everyone for the messages as well, it is awesome to see them thank you so much! As far as I can tell I cant actually reply to them?? But I definately check them each time I log on so thank you! I just tried to upload pictures from my camera as well but no luck, so will have to try again from another place once next time!

Ciao!

 

 
Feliz Pascua de Valpariso, Vina del Mar y Cerra la campana!

2008-03-20 to 2008-03-23


Happy Easter from Valpariso, Vina Del Mar and Mount Campana!

 Good Friday was a day off school so I met Jenny, Pancha, Tatiana and Andre around the corner at the school house on Roman Diez to catch the metro to the bus station. It was packed!!! So by the time we had lined up for the tickets the buses were full for the next two hours. Somehow (???!) or other we managed to spanish speak our way onto an earlier bus and we were on our way for the 2 hour drive to Viña Del Mar. Upon arrival we decided to take a tour and spent the day driving around the sights of Viña Del Mar such as the giant chiming flower clock, the interesting architecture, the beach, casino, stadiums, lookouts, lapizlasuli shops and a museum with a moai from Rapa Nui (Isla Pascua, Easter Island) etc etc... and avoiding the gypsies who were determined to get our money! 

 

 We then headed to Renaca for lunch on the water and then to Valparisa which is an awesome old UNESCO town with a fantastic atmosphere and thousands of old coloured houses on all the hills! We went to another house of the poet Pablo Neruda (he has 3 in the Santiago area), caught the fernicular up a hill and walked around the markers,enjoying the view before looking at the port and the worlds craziest intersection / pedestrian mall/ parking area / and national monument all in one!After a few failed attempts to get to the monument we decided it was much safer to look from a distance! 

 

 Heading back to the hostel we walked around Viña del Mar and then to a local pub where Jenny and Tat had the world`s most giant feast of chips and meat about 30cm high! And no, they didnt even get half way! 

 

 Up bright and early on Saturday to find a closed train terminal so managed to locate the bus station instead. Pancha and I caught a local microlet out of town on crazy roads with a crazy driver picking up locals from the side of the road to sell stuff on the bus... which people actually brought! We guessed the right stop at Limache and swapped buses as per guidance from another passenger on the bus. Unfortunately he clearly knew as much about the area as we did as the bus he pointed us toward didn`t actually go to where we wanted! Dropping us off on the side of the road to navigate our way to the national park. 

 After a few km`s of of landscape that reminded me very much of of Timor, we arrived at the entrance to Parque Nacional ready to begin the hike up cerra la campana, the highest mountain in this area of Chile... armed with our sneakers and overnight bags! The park ranger was concerned we wouldn`t make it as it was past 10am by this stage, the hike was at least 7-8 hours and the park shut at 5:30.We convinced him we could walk `muy rapido` and set off on a cracking pace. The dodgy piece of paper he had given us with a black and white sketch of a mountain with lines cris crossing didn`t really assist us too much so we took turns in front eeny meeny minie moing which path to take! We figured as long as it was going up we couldn`t be too far wrong....! 

 

 What we didn`t know however was how ridiculously steep the mountain was!! After beginning on a slight gradient it turned into one step up and two steps back as we slipped our way back down again. We then passed the plaques killed in earthquakes and to commemorate where Charles Darwin had climbed and then...finally! could see the summit. From there we lost the little arrows we were following and so just started climbing upwards! And i mean literally climbing! with hands and feet over massive boulders hanging on for dear life and not wanting to look down or slip, lest we fell 7 km down to our death as nothing was there to stop us! It was unbelieveable and we have no photos as there was no way we were taking our hands off the rocks! We weren`t sure if we would make it, but over 2 hours since we saw the top and started rock climbing and just over 3 hours since we began the trail we reached the summit! Although deadly exhausted it was well worth it literally sitting on top of the world at 2000m altitude to eat our lunch in possibly the quietest place I have ever been. 

 

 We had no idea how we would get down, but luckily had some chileans to follow which made it a lot easier to navigate. Over 6 hours after we started we arrived back to see the suprised ranger and receive dodgy bus directions home which left us wandering around a tiny town called parque del los cabellos looking for a bus company that did not exist! We managed to get a cab back to Limache and from there a bus to Santiago which dropped us somewhere past the last metro stop! We arrived back at the house filthy dirty, but full of our adventure about 11pm! 

 

 As it was Tat and Jenny`s last night we showered and met at the school house for a few drinks which then turned into a crazy night at a spanish karoake bar in bellavista with someones Chilean friends! 

 

 Easter Sunday, my host family, Pancha and I headed to mass before coming home for a quiet afternooon and walking to Bellavista with my swiss host sister Marden (Marlene) for lunch on the street about half past 4....so Chilean! We walked through the neighbourhoods and parks home for dinner and then spent the evening chatting in spanish with my host mother Monica who explained how she used to be a biology professor, but for the past 5 years has taken in students! She says she hasnt travelled much and she has no requirement to as now the world comes to her! which is really lovely. Her other children arrived for dinner about half past 9 so we chatted in spanish some more before bed. 

 
Santiago

2008-03-24 to 2008-03-28


Okay.... inventive subject title i know!!! So tired though! And I have done so much it is really hard to remember!!!! School as usual this week of course, but also with lots of other exciting things as well.... Monday arfternoon saw us heading to a local gyro shop for lunch, followed by some of the greatest ice cream at Manual Mont with huge huge HUGE serves for so cheap!!! We also found out that the crazy people running around with ripped clothes, covered in food and confetti and socks wereò`week uni students completing a ritual that happened every year which is why people gave them money! We had been wondering for ages as we saw them constantly around! That night we had a cooking lesson at the school with ceviche, which is raw fish, soaked in lemon juice, onion, corriander, pepper and something else.... interesting... glad i tried it, but not something I would eat again! We also made our own Terremotos, the earthquake drink with wine and ice cream. We chatted for hours before heading back to Manuel Mont for what we think are Santiago`s greatest Mojito`s!

Tuesday afternoon was lunch at a mexican restaurant.... sooo weird. Chilean Mexican i guess! Enchilladas like I have never seen! And then a trip to the pre columbian museum to have a tour in Spanish which was intreresting.. i think! I figured out what each thing was, but more or less that was it!!! Very different cultures! And so ancient. It was interesting to see the way things were done soooo long ago and with the added difficulty of having the Andes in the way! We also saw a special exhibition on the Moche people (who lived below the Incans) and their really really strange beliefs on life, the afterlife, the tribal heirachy and sexual beliefs explained through ceramic figures. I have never seen anything quite so weird in all my life!!! The day ended with a nice dinner with the family and my other host sister carmen who had returned from her travels in Argentina.

Wednesday Afternoon I visited the Cementario General (Cemetary) after hearing good reviews and I was not disappointed. It was absolutely amazing. Covering several blocks there were tombs, graves, and rows on rows of creamation ....windows?? I am not sure the right word! They were really old as well, from the 1800s to present and mostly so well maintained. It was absolutely fascinating!! Unfortunately I got followed around by some dodgy guy for a good 15 minutes before I managed to find a guard and get rid of him, but alls well that ends well i guess!

That evening we had the rhythms of Easter Island dance class at the school. It was awesome fun, even if no one could make it actually look good! We then sat around chatting before heading out to Manuel Mont to put it into practice!

Thursday we had Chilean Italian for lunch.... much better than Chilean Mexican! I then walked around the shops at Manuel Mont and brought myself spanish book... It says ages 5-8 but it is really hard!!!! I then decided to walk from the metro out to Mall Parque Arauco which is a Westfield type shopping centre out of the city... but after seeing lots of shiny floors and not much else so I headed to Parque Araucano next door on recommendation from my host mother Monica.  It was the most amazing park, full of beautiful trees, folowers, grass and landscaped so well! It was so peaceful sitting in the shade and so beautiful!! Definately the best park I have seen in ages! Tired and hot, I headed home to change and head to school for movie night with my host sister Madlene to watch the Chilean Film `Machuka` which is about the events in Chile in 1973 when the military forceably took power. It was really very interesting as I had no idea just how awful it was and all the atrocities that took place. We headed home for an early night, but found the house full of family for our host daughters 5th birthday. We joined in for cake and present opening and I was `treated`to a `manicure and pedicure`by the birthday girl Renata... I was covered in shiny pink nailpolish everywhere that I still cannot get off! We had a great night with the family, sitting around chatting though before bed.

Friday was my last day at school and received my certificate at the farewell lunch. A group of us then headed to Bella vista for a quiet afternoon sitting outside where we learnt very quickly not to just take any coloured chiar to sit on at resturants. Each coloured plastic chair meant a different restaurant had your bill! Home to change and back to school ready for the show Los Mochichos. Catching cabs, we arrived to receive a traditional Chilean drink of Pisco Sour and a massive grill filled with layers upon layers of meat in front of us!!!! We dined and watched traditional Chilean dances and also dancers from Easter Island which were fantastic. We then spent the night dancing to the wonderful latino music and marvelling about how it is that all latin americans can dance!!!

Another exciting thing happened during the week as well!! I managed sentences in past and present spanish!! Together!! For those of you not learning spanish... that is a mean feat!!!!!! And i am finally starting to actually feel confident talking to people and even somewhat understanding them which is awesome! I just hope I don`t go downhill now that I have finished school though!!

A not so cool thing that happened during the week was that four different people from school had their wallets/passports stolen so it really just enforces how careful you need to be. They are so sneaky though, one was taken from someones front pocket in their pants without them even noticing! 

I am trying to make my blogs interesting to read, but am so squished with time i am just hoping for the best sorry!! I plan to edit them when I have some more time!!!!! I will also upload some more pic´s later in the week! Thanks for the messages and I hope everyone is well. love k xx

 
Cajon del Maipo, Vina Del Mar, Valparaisa, and almost! Mendoza, Argentina... but back to Santiago.

2008-03-29 to 2008-04-01


Saturday began at the school bright and early... Australian time, not Chilean time we were told to make sure we were there on time... but the taxi was late anyway as it was still on Chilean time! We drove about an hour to Cajon del Maipo up into the hills with beautiful scenery to walk through the forest and begin our `canopy day`. It was great fun going over the flying foxes soooooooooooooo high up!!!!, the bridge and the leap of faith before lunch and then heading back to catch the metro to the bus stop with Swiss Patricia, Canada Claire, American Scott and an Englsih couple Aaron and Keely (who are also travelling around the world!). We caught the bus to Viña Del Mar and did a walking tour of the city trying to find a hostel!! We eventually ended up where I stayed last week! We headed out and my beliefs about how strange non Australian Mexican food is were confirmed again with some kind of weird fried double tortilla with oily rice, and who knows what else turning up as my `burrito`. sooooo weird. We continued visiting various places around the area and checking out Viña by night before heading back to the hotel. 

The next morning... or several hours later! We caught a bus into Valpariasa and took a boat tour of the harbour which was really cool seeing just how big the UNESCO city with all the houses on the hills was! We even saw a sea lion up close. 

We took another `walking tour`of the city to find lunch at a cool little house/cafe thing and stayed for hours! We wandered around the streets and markets before catching a bus back to Vina Del Mar to visit the beach... where I began to feel really sick. Luckily a few stops and a few tablets later it didn´t turn out to be the week long Delhi Belly (for those that were there in the Himalayas with me!) but fingers crossed that is my sickness over and done with!!

After deciding to head to Mendoza, Argentina, I waved goodbye as the others headed back to Santiago for school and found somewhere relatively safe away from the dodgy dark corners and Gypsies to bide my time until my bus left at 22:30 where I sat in an internet `cafe` waiting for a night bus to Mendoza, Argentina. I was plnning to update my blog, however the keyboard was so old there are no letters left on the keys and with things in different places it wasn`t going to happen!!! And unfortunately that was not the only thing that was not to be!!! After having no problems buying my ticket with my NZ passport to avoid paying the crazy fees, i was refused entry... I knew having 2 passports from 2 different countries in 2 different names would cause me dramas at some stage!!!! And I am sure my perfect spanish really helped!! Not!! but anyway! I was sent directly to the police station.. a lovely walk through the dingy back streets for half an hour in the middle of the night! before being stuck there being questioned until the early morning in dodgy spanish. When the other officer arrived, he spoke English, but was like meh, back to Santiago on the first bus in the morning you go!!!! I was then escorted in the van to a hotel where they woke up the owners and make them take me in for what was left of the rest of the night before i was up bright and early for the bus!

Luckily that was uneventful and arrived at some random metro stop way out of town. It is so weird. Every time I take a bus from Santiago I end up at a different metro stop!! I so don´t get it!!! But got to experience the Santiago Metro Peak Hour... certainly not an experience I want ever again!!! Although the metros come about literally every 2 or so minutes, everyone was jammed in like sardines and each stop more and more pushed in, although i have no idea how. I think that is the worst I have been in anywhere in the world!! But at least no one was grabbing you up Turkey style so that was all good! Although I don`t know how, I managed not to get crushed to death, somehow got out at the right stop and as an added bonus still had my passport, wallet and camera!! nice!!!

As very few people were out, it was a great opportunity to check out centro, downtown Santiago and walk around looking at the old buildings, fountains, churches and statues. I then visited La Moneda, where the President of Chile works, but it was closed to the public this morn.

For those in NZ and the family, I found the Chilean version of Grandma´s Caramel Merangue Slice! It uses this South American version of caramel that is everywhere (Manjar) and has really thin layers of biscuit (like 2mm), caramel and merangue all several times over. Nice! ...But not as good as yours of course Grandma! :+)

I then headed out to Los Dominicoes to see the handicraft markets. These were so awesome! There were just random alleyways of different arts and crafts (and dogs of course!) lots of friendly shopowners with hardly any tourists. I found some really cool little painted tiles which I am hoping survive the post back to Australia!

Back to school to catch up for lunch (Chilean Thai is good... although I am not sure how Thai spinach pie actually is!), chatting and some net time before heading home for dinner and preparing for Argentina... attempt #2 tonight!!

 

 
Finally...Mendoza, Argentina...(for one day!), and Adios Santiago!

2008-03-31 to 2008-04-02


The moons must have been in alignment last night as after dinner I headed off to catch the bus to Mendoza... and everything worked! The bus left at half past 10 so kind of slept until I was woken up about half past 1 this morning to line up at the border. I felt like I was in world war 2 as we filed off and lined up in the cold behind one concrete block to leave Chile and then over the other side again to enter Argentina. We then all lined up in a circle (okay i know that doesnt make sense!!) and had all our bags checked before being put back on the bus to go again!! And no one spoke so I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing!! It was so weird and I only wish I had a photo... but didn´t want to risk ending up with the police again!!! :+)

We arrived bright and early into Mendoza... at like 4am and of course everything was closed and pitch black so I amused myself walking laps of the terminal for a few hours ( no, it wasn`t big... like 5 mins each way!!) so I didn´t sit down, fall asleep and get my stuff stolen! FINALLY the tour place opened and I booked a tour of the Wineries (as Mendoza is very famous for its wines) and around the city. I told the dude I was going to walk into town and he looked at me funny and saidìt`s 7 blocks` like I was some kind of freak... it was only then I figured out that there was a time change from Argentina to Chile and the tour left in 10 mins, not an hour 10mins as I had thought. Oops. Lucky I figured that one out!

I joined an American couple from Miami, Roberto and Terry and a Brazillian couple as we headed out to Maipo first to a beautiful old family owned winery ( ................ whose name I will remember!) which still used all traditional methods. We got a full tour of exactly how the wine was made and how you pick whether it is a good wine etc which was really interesting as I never knew it before! We then headed to a second winery which was a lot larger and used all brand new methods to produce their wines which was really interesting to see as well. The countryside was so beautiful as well, it was just amazing. We then headed to lunch at Valley Tulun where we had Argentina`s best empanadas (it is like the best pie contest in Australia! And it is really hard and very tough!!!) And they were really really good!

I then walked around town which was just beautiful - lots of trees, plazas, parks, massive open drains!, big wide streets and it was a lot bigger than I had anticipated as well so it took a few hours. I thought it must have been a public holiday at first, but then I realised that everythig still shuts after lunch or people to have a siesta and then reopens around dinner time. That´s the life!!! ...And I dont think Argentineans eat much besides meat as it was so hard to find anything else to eat all day!!!!

I headed back to the bus station to join the city tour. The only ones available were in spanish and I must say as we drove around town looking left and right at random houses, museums, cathedrals etc etc I wasn`t able to stay awake! I guess 2 nights without sleep does that to you!! But we then headed to the remains of an old church which is all that was left from when the massive earthquake that destroyed the town hit in the 1800´s and then began seeing the beautiful parks and plazas. We then drove up Cerro de la Gloria which was just beautiful seeing the Andes and the amazing view. At the top was the statue of the Armies of the Andes which was just amazing and is the picture that is on the Argentinean $5 note.

The final stop was the coolest church I have ever been to. It was absolutely massive and with the Andes as a backdrop, just amazing. It was so interesting and had a second part that was like a hmmm not really sure what you call it, but it was absolutely full of plaques for people who had passed away. So interesting!!! It was called out lady of the lourdes or something like that... but I will check the lonely planet and find the right name as it was sooo cool! I then brought a little neck pendant at the store it had such an impact on me. I tried to get both san Cristobel and Lourdes, for the church and the patron saint of travellers, but it was not to be! 

Heading back to the bus terminal, I found a place to settle in for the next few hours until the bus came at 11pm. It was packed out this time so was dreading who I was to sit next to ( you have allocated seats) but ended up with this crazy french chick named Anna who has been living in Santiago for the past few years. We chatted whilst trying to ignore the annoying sounds of Shrek dubbed into spanish before the curtains were pulled for us, lights went off and we were totally blacked out meaning sleep! At about half past 1 we were blinded by full on fluro lights meaning wake up now!!! And told to leave the blankets on the bus and file out in an orderly manner.... luckily Anna spoke spanish!!! We went out to the freezing freezing cold and lined up for the quite quick queue into Argentina and then forever in the Chilean queue. Another bus was being searched so we stood out in the cold as were not allowed to stand in the shelter. Once this was finished, all our bags were then scanned and tons of things confiscated and half the people refused to own up to their bags!!! We were told to line up in an orderly manner behind the desks and have our customs declarations ready. We handed these in and then Anna remembered she had these fruit pastries in her carry on. We had already passed the opportunity to get rid of it and.... as you do at 2 in the morning after having no sleep we randomly decided to quickly eat them all!! Ducking behind our bags we filled our mouths whilst trying not to laugh as it was all so serious! We had not finished as the sniffer dog came around on the desks, first going crazy at Annas backpack and then pinning us both up against the glass wall behind us with its nose on our mouths as the entire place stared at us!!! Luckily his handler decided to move on as it was the drug dog so we still had time!! ...But not enough! We were then ordered again into orderly files to go through the scanner and we threw our bags through together. Mine was pulled out and searched extensively whilst Anna grabbed hers and quickly stood back as they had mixed them up!!! After forever of pulling everything out, not finding anything, trying again and investigating my toiletries one by one, the guy became fascinated that I was from Australia and kept saying `Kangaroo`, Kangaroo` non stop and mumbling something that could have been spanish or an attempt at english i have no idea!! Somehow my saying `Si`and `Kangaroo` enough times he decided to let me go and we quickly dashed back onto the bus whilst trying not to laugh!!! Sooo funny! Of course by this stage we were so full of sugar and could not stop laughing and there was no way that we were going to sleep, even though the `sleep now!`lights had happened, so we braved opening the curtains, and checked out the amazing mountains and stars through the windows. It would be an absolutely amazing drive by day!!!

After an awesome day, we arrived sooo tired at about half past 4 in the morn and no metro running so found a kindly Chilean willing to share his cab to drop me off to head home for some sleep!!

Although feeling like death late this morning I headed out to the post office to send some things home. What an ordeal!!! With the 2 slowest tellers in history, I lined up behind 4 people which took a good 20 mins to get to the counter and buy a box. A choice of 2 boxes, no bags and nothing else! I then had the box and so needed to find some bubble wrap to protect my tiles from the markets. With nothing around, the only thing I could find wa a shower curtain shop (yes, they have these!!) and after about 5 mins of gesturing I convinced the guy i wanted a shower curtain to wrap my stuff! He was convinced I was doing it for a present and so cut it perfectly and wrapped it (i don`t know why he didn`t find this weird... but anyway!!!), but finally i got the message across i didnt want it to break and got more plastic in there!!!! That took a good 20 mins, so then back to the post office to re-queue and then fill out the most confusing address box i have ever seen and spend another half hour at the counter with the teller!!! And then pay a fortune for it!!!! So mum... i sent a box home... fingers crossed it gets there, but I really am not holding my breath!!!!!!

Lunch with some guys from school and then the net before heading home to try and pack!! A final dinner with the family and then a party at Paz`s house this evening ( the lady that took us to the Canopy day) and also Canada Rob`s host home for the final evening with all the gang from school... before heading home for a few hours to get up at half past 4 to squish my bag closed (let me tell you that took some time!!!) and to get to the airport for the flight! I am definately going to miss my Chilean Family, friends and school, but have more adventures to come....

Ciao Santiago, and Hola Peru!!!

Adios Chile... Hola Peru!

 
Welcome to Lima, Peru

2008-04-03 to 2008-04-05


Seriously lacking in sleep i somehow finished packing and got into the transfer van more or less on time! We then stopped off to pick up another girl, Kate, who was actually heading to Peru´s Challenge as well that that was kind of cool to meet up and have the same flight into Peru. What a nightmare flight though! A tiny little plane and there was a pillow thief too!! We made it safely to our transfer and to the hotel in Miraflores where we dropped our stuff and headed out to walk around town.

Lima definately has the absolute craziest road system! Far Out! What a nightmare trying to cross the road - there are no pedestrian lights so you have to wait until the cars stop for their lights and time your run before they start beeping and driving towards you in any which manner. Muy Muy Loco!! My head was so tired from concentrating afterwards. I cannot even begin to describe how many times we thought that was it!! Loco!!

But we had a nice stroll around town. Lima is about the same height as Cooktown so it is quite muggy and warm, but tolerable! There are heaps of markets to look at and lots of fresh food. We had an awesome lunch in a cafe that was really fantastic...but then went to the post office to buy stamps for postcards and found them to be more expensive for one that what we paid for lunch!! Soooo... I have decided I would rather eat then go back to the post office in Peru... I hope you guys all agree with my decision!!!! :+)

I headed out with Kate M and Courtney for dinner and managed to make it there and back alive. We were so tired though so early night ready to get up and meet Ally in the morning!! We somehow got lucky and both on seperate tours/plans arrived in Lima on the same day!

Waking early to construction work and the cold and sore throat from hell I struggled downstairs to ask directions to a pharmacy and play charades to get some medications... but all good and stable enough to meet Ally!! We walked down along the beach, past the park of love and to the waterfront dining. On a budget we then headed into town for lunch!

As her tour had finished, Ally then joined the Perus Challenge group on our tour of Lima which was nice to spend some more time together. We spent the afternoon seeing the sights of Lima by bus, before starting a walking tour of a museum with preserved traditional all gold masks and Incan relics, the amazing plazas and then onto the monastery and cathedral and to the underground catacombs. ally and I bid farewell as she headed back to the US and the Perus Challenge group continued to see the sunset over Miraflores and then out to dinner.

Waking up still with an awful cold and although not knowing the exact time of our transfer we headed downstairs for breakfast / white rolls of course! / which by the time the staff went out to buy them, we grabbed them and headed for the transfer. Arriving at the airport we found we had been placed on an earlier flight and had about 15 mins to get through the queues before boarding began!! Due to donations, Courtney was told to move fromt eh line, pay oversize baggage and then rejoin the check in queue. Really really pressed for time Courtney and I waited and then ran upstairs to board.. only to find another queue double the length to pay a 6 dollar departure fee!!! The officials refused to let us move to the front, even though our flight had been called and we queued and queued and paid as the final boarding call came through. Running out the other side, we then hit Another queue!! For screening!!! Courtney got through, but a different official wouldnt let me queue jump and Courtney called through to ask them to hold the plane as I finally got through and we ran through the airport to board the final bus at the gate!!!

The Andes were amazing poking snow capped peaks through the clouds as we flew, before touching down at an altitude of about 3900m in Cuzco. As we had somehow been moved to an earlier flight we had a bit of waiting for our transfer before being picked up by Mark, the Perus Challenge leader and arriving at our new house!

The house has a downstairs and 2 upstairs compartments. I am sharing a room downstairs with Sarah and we have a kitchen and bathroom ... for 7! Due to the altitude we were told to take it easy and just headed down to the local store for some essential groceries... not much else available!!! and water before taking it easy for the rest of the afternoon... and lots of resting as I felt soooo unwell!

After tablets and resting and feeling slightly more human, we met some other housemates and braving the cold headed into town for dinner, walking near the beautiful Plaza de Armas and then to a restaurant for some Peruvian dinner and a crazy toilet that had a floor that was covered in straw! We caught a crazy taxi back with all 8 of us squished in and then straight off to bed!

Sunday saw a lazy lie in stopped by the planes flying overhead about 7 before a cold cold cold shower!!! brr!!!! so nasty in such cold cold weather! We caught a collectivo, which is a van with as many people squished in as possible into the San Sebastian markets to buy fresh fruit and veg. Arriving at the market, we pulled ourselves out of the Batman and into a time warp! It was the most amazing experience seeing the colours and excitment in the market with locals in traditional dress selling their fresh fruit and veg, flowers, herbs and all sorts of fresh goodies. After going crazy with buying and conversing with the locals, we caught the Batman back to the house to drop the groceries and then again out to the larger supermercado to see if we could find real groceries!

Walking around we found pretty much most of the things we needed before standing in the rain to squish back into another collectivo with all our shopping and heaps and heaps of locals back to the house!

After lunch was a team meeting to find out all the details for Perus Challenge and get a chance to chat with all the other members. Sarah, Kate and I then caught the Rapido into town to walk around the Plaza de Armas and surrounding streets before having a drink... pina con leche... pineapple and milk!! interesting! but goodish!!

Back at the house we navigated around all the others in the kitchen to cook dinner, check the program and fainally figured out how to turn the heater on before heading off ready for our beginnings tomorrow!!

 
Perus Challenge, Pumamarca, Cuzco UPDATED!!!!!!

2008-04-06 to 2008-04-11


After reading about Perus Challenge about 5 years ago and always wanting to come, I finally made it! ...www.peruschallenge.com if you want to check it out!

The organisation was founded by an Australian, Jane, and a Peruvian, Selby to provide sustainable support to the local community. So currently we are working in a community called Pumacarma, which is about a half hour drive from our volunteer house in Cuzco up windy dirt roads into the beautiful hills filled with lovely friendly people, mud brick houses and all kinds of animals!

Previously the children of the community had to get up in the morning, and with no breakfast, walk for several hours over the hills to get to school and were so exhausted fell asleep at their desk, then woke up and began the walk home. Perus Challenge has now built a school building in Pumacarma so the children can come to school locally and has worked with the edication department to provide 4 teachers, and the organisation emplys another 2, and the volunteers take the remainder of classes, such as arts and craft, english, sports and hygeine. Also with Peru’s challenge we do work with the‘talleres’workshop where the women of the community can produce crafts in order to earn an income, and also assist the social worker, Iris on homevisits.

It is actually really really cool as we are all asked to bring goods to donate, but then that is what we use for all the lessons so we actually see them all in use! There is a magic storeroom at the house, full of goods donated by previous volunteers and whenever you plan a lesson you just head into it, find whateveryou need and make the lesson happen!! So way cool!!

Last month the volunteers worked on a massive vege garden to grow food to feed the children and started construction on an additional mud brick building to be used as a hall, and also a place for the mothers to be able to gather to make their handcrafts and then eventually will be able to be used to sell them. This month we are continuing on with these as well.

Once Perus Challenge have completed work in the area, it will be fully self sustainable for the community to continue and the organisation will move on and begin work in another needy area.

Monday morning we began piling into the van to drive up to the community to begin work! The children all ran out to greet us and wanted to play, calling us all Amiga! or Amigo! Then it was time for classes to start and it was really quite funny having to physically grab the children and put them in their classes and then hold the door shut so they couldnt escape!! We have a couple of American Children, Ally and Andy in our group and the chldren just love them! They too had to be trapped in the class rooms as the children didnt want to leave them!!

Some people had allocated classes in the morning, but I began with painting of the new building before getting ready and taking a PE class with Alvin, Toby and Peter for the grades 3 and 4. We had over 30 kids running around so excited and all started well with stretches, captain ball, volley ball before they started to get super excited and hyper so we took them on a massive run with follow the leader through all kinds of obstacles. Unfortunately it was all over red rover and we could no longer convince them to listen to our mediocre spanish lesson plan and resorted to random games of soccer, skipping, and general running around... but hey, it was all exercise and so much fun! But the altitude really does get to you and far out it was hard to breathe after running around with them for a while... it doesnt help you have about three hanging off you and one around your neck though either!!

We finished off up at the school and headed back for a spanish lesson for the afternoon. We then found out one of the girls in the group had contracted scabies from the kids so is up for some massive disinfecting! Another couldnt get out of bed with gastro so the rest of us have our fingers crossed we miss out!

It starts to get dark and quite cold before 6 in the evening so we cooked dinner and spent the evening chatting in the volunteer house.

###############

No hot water again this morning after we also lost power! I headed upstairs where there was still remnants and received the brief not to touch anything metal or you would get electrocuted. One of the taps is metal and one plastic. Even though you only use the one ‘hot’plastic tap as the water is still only warm, habit just forces you to reach out and turn both off…and yes.. nice electric shock!!

 A group of us then caught the‘rapido’into town to pay our money for the month with Mark. We then wandered around with Ash and Tobi showing us all the interesting places they had found throughout Cuzco before the next stop at Heidi’s. It is a restaurant/ caférun by a German in braces…but we didn’t get to see him this time! It has beautiful fresh food and heaps of interesting things so I tried the‘manzanacoup’which is‘an apple milkshake with a little something extra’! and it was sooo good that I then wanted to try the drink that Tobi had…the dulce de leche. It was a hot toffee milkshake and unbelievably sooooo good!! Like possibly the best hot drink I have ever had!! Next on the agenda was hailing a cab to squish into to find the el morido markets which is kind of like a black market, but all kosher and everyone shops there, tourists and locals alike.... with everything you could possibly imagine! We wandered around for a while and I found a new warm jacket that I later discovered has the most crooked zipper I have ever seen, starting from the top in the middle and then ending almost over my right hip, instead of in the center of my stomach!! and also a new t shirt as I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo…I think you get the picture!!!.. sick of wearing the same 4 I brought with me every single day!!! Back via another supermercado as each one just has slightly different things in it to look at and buy, before starting another Spanish lesson. This one wasn’t the right level, so I then did some lesson planning for the English lesson I was taking at the school the next day and waited for the next lesson which was perfect and awesome fun! Becoming pros at squishing into small places, we all jumped into a van and headed into this cool restaurant……… with glass windows overlooking Plaza de Armas in town. There we began this amazing buffet feast with every kind of delicious food imaginable and also got to try Alpacker, which was really good! ...i hope you are impressed Uncle Peter!!!... There are so many amazing and beautifully presented desserts here! The table was laden with sooooo many different varieties and quite a few with the caramel/toffee manjar too! Everywhere here there is this really really dark, almost black purple corn which was stewed up with a rice pudding. It looked interesting, but it tasted so good! So many cool different things to try! A fantastic Andes band played all night to entertain us, whilst dancers from all around the area performed traditional dancers in their traditional costumes…lots of‘traditionals’in that sentence I know,…but it is early!!! And there is no hot water to wake me up!!!  Wednesday saw a group of us heading out early to enjoy the gorgeous scenery and walk through the valley and up the hill to school, about an hour and a half away. But you really don’t realize just how much the altitude affects you!!! Or maybe my lack of regular exercise whilst backpacking... but we all made it! Arriving at school I began the morning’s English lesson with Sarah and Courtney with the grade 5 and 6’s which was a real challenge with no training and only a rough idea from the volunteer folder. We taught parts of the body and finished with the `heads, shoulders, knees and toes` game which they just loved. Unfortunately the lesson was 15 mins longer than we had anticipated and so then had hyper kids to sit down and teach again for another 15! We then played with the kids on their break for a bit on the sea saw with them all piled on and me on one side and Kateo and then Fred on the other... such a leg workout!! I was suprised I could still walk afterwards!!! The kids are so cute and friendly and welcoming though and just want to be your friend, it is so lovely! I then helped out with PE for the grades 1 and 2. All started well as Courtney and I took them over the monkey bars and balance beams and swapped groups... and then chaos ensured! We managed some kind of control through the activities and then into the hacky sack and spoon races which they just loved. 

After arriving home we quickly headed out to Miguels in the next street over for a set 3.50 menu...which is like 1.50! of a yuka soup...kind of like sweet potato and then a traditional rice and meat dish. Back to taste some cakes that Sentusa, a lady employed by Perus Challenge cooked for us. Oh my gosh!! The fresh banana cake was soooooooo fantastic!!!! I could definately get used to life here!!!!!

Next stop was to quickly pile into the van to head out on the home vists. Waiting for the social worker, Iris, we picked up random people from the Pumamarca community to squish into the van for the drive up to the hills. After about 45mins sitting in an intersection we left withour Iris and headed up to visit the home firstly of a lady who had just had a premature baby and then the visit I assisted with was to visit a few brothers who had been moved to a different house because of problems in their home. They now lived in this small one room mudbrick house, but they were keeping it really neat and tidy and cooking food for themselves each day! Iris then caught up with us and we did an intial visit on an additional family so Iris could be aware how each family were coping and try to assist them in they needed it. This family was really well off with a 2 storey mud brick home, a communal bedroom upstairs for the parents and three children with a small stereo and tv!!!! And downstairs a storeroom with hundreds of potatoes and also a kitchen which was full of cages and cages and cages of guinea pigs! Guinea pigs, or cuy are a delicacy here in South America, so they were being bred for selling and eating! It ws just so weird to see a tiny wood stove in the corner where all the meals were cooked and the remainder of space taken up with guinea pigs!!!

Quickly home to grab another jumper and into cabs to go to the Flamengo v cienciento soccer game! It was a Brazil team v a Cusco team and was entirely sold out. Becomming quite scared as we walked past the armoured police vehicles, water cannons and riot squads to enter, we got there over an hour before the game started, but already it was fully packed out with over 40 000 people!! We had caught different cabs and never expected to find each other again, but looking for a place to stand to see the game, we spied some of our group right at the very front seats of the stadium!Making our way down we found heaps of spare seats... well... spare concrete and enjoyed a first class view of the game!! It was right in front of the fence which is why we think they were free, but fantastic for us!! It did give us cold, numb butts by the end of the game though!

Chris, Toby and Stu went crazy buying the cheaps merchandise and all the local food that was being brought around. We tried heart on a stick with potato on top which is very common and once you got over the fact you were eating heart, was actually quite tasty! And also Alpacker on a stick! Unfortunately the only drinks on offer were coffee straight out of the teapot they carried around or cups of coke, so I went very very thirsty as you wernt allowed to bring any in. I asked for water, but they looked at me like I was crazy!! It was really really weird though seeing children about 5 or 6 wandering around selling things like cigarettes and lollies.

The crowd was absolutely crazy!! There were flares, smoke grenades and fire crackers going off inside the stadium all night... although I am not sure how you are allowed them and not water!!! Even young children were sitting on top of barbed wire fences setting them off! Also confetti and drums and music, it was fantastic!! Every time Brazil had the ball the crowd all just whistled and whistled and whistled so loudly to put them off. Each time the teams came onto or left the field the riot squad had to protect them as well! In the second half, brazil scored their second goal, making the score 2=0 to Brazil. At this stage half the crowd just got up to leave! As the final goal was scored, making Brazil 3 to Cuzco`s nil, even more just left! It certinaly made it easier for us to leave at the end with so many less people! As the game ended, heaps and heaps of the crowd throw rolls of toilet paper at the losing team as they left the field protected by the riot police. So strange!!

On the way out we braved the crowd and tried different meat on sticks at various food vendors outside before trying in vain to catch a cab with the rest of Cuzco for about 45 mins in the freezing cold! All the collectivo vans were also full, but finally found one with a bit of spare and squished on. One of the girls, Katrina was in front and as she took her hand out of her pocket to climb in, her wallet was taken from it!! So quick and sneaky!!!! You just have to be so careful. We squashed all 10 of us into one row of seats and make it back alive about half past 11 after an absolutely awesome, jam packed but exhausting day!!!

Finally getting some drugs for all my sickness, I then the cold, cough and stomach parasite began to clear!! We had a lazy start thank goodness and a cooking lesson with Sentusa, so we all crammed into our kitchen and dining room to begin chopping and peeling and grating and all kinds of things. Several hours later we had a massive Peruvian feast of cream of quinea soup, aji de gallina (a spicy creamy chicken) and a apple pie that was the best!! It was a very bready pastry and the apple filling was so delicious! You had to be quick for seconds on that one!! It took a while to clean up the kitchen and the 3 billion saucepans, plates, bowls, cutlery and everything and then redivide between the apartments and before we knew it, it was time for our next spanish lesson!

I then walked down to Inca Plaza with Andrea for a bit of fresh air and some bits and pieces and spent the night chatting upstairs, planning our next PE class and eating their delicious pumpkin soup before Ash, Charlotte, Courtney and I began ransacking the magic storeroom for supplies for our yearss 1 and 2 art classes the next day. We made examples of faces on paper plates with a paddle pop stick so the kids could hold them up like masks before heading off to bed, still recovering from our mega wednesday!

Friday saw most of the house wake up sick, so hopefully we all shake it soon!!! I think I am slowly getting better... fingers crossed! But again anyway, a group of us began the walk up to the school, this time taking one of the shortcuts up the side of the mountain, instead of on the windy trails... geez it was hard! But we figure good training for the Inca trails! We made it to school in less time today so that was comforting as well!

Courtney and I had art class first up with the years 1 and 2s and they were soooo excited once we started bringing the art supplies out! Somehow we manage to keep them under control, explain what we were doing in spanish and have a fantastic lesson helping them make their masks!!

A short break for me and it was straight into PE for the grades 5 and 6. It took a while for them to get going and they all just stood around while we tried to make them stretch, but once we did some sit ups and push ups, the boys all started joining in and we then gabe them all a number `1` or `2` to make even teams for volleyball. Somehow when they all ran to their team leader, all the girls had decided to be `2` and all the boys `1`s! So we ended up with a boy v girl volleyball game as they did not want to seperate!! We then played rounders which it took a few turns to understand, but once they had it, they just loved it and didnt want to stop once the lesson had ended!!

The ladies workshop group, `talleres` had placed all their goods out for sale in the building we had been painting for them so we had a look through there and could buy some pieces from them such as beanies, scarves, wristbands, headbands, bags etc before tour groups began coming through to generate an income for the community.

Back home and after lunch, Courtney and I caught the rapido int o town to wander around all the cool little shops around the plaza de armas. We found some great little places! And it was so nice that people didnt harass you, if you said `no, gracias`, they just left you alone! nice change! Back via the supermercado to the house for dinner and an early night. What a great week.... but exhausting!! 

 

 

 

 
I guess sooner or later it was bound to happen!

2008-04-12 to 2008-04-18


In Peru there are about a zillion different types of banana, but most of them are actually orange and a kind of hard sweet potato consistency inside and need cooking before you eat them. They all look the same to the untrained tourist eye, so it takes a lot of skill to get a regular banana!!! Saturday morning, the house was still asleep so I decided to try cooking up one of the cooking bananas that are near impossible to eat raw... and sooo good! I tried them first plain, which was nice, but not very sweet, so then with honey and cinnamon... soooo good!! At least now I know what to do when we buy the wrong ones again!

Hmm okay as a post script after having written the above, the bananas were the last thing I ate before i got sick (reference below) and so never want to see one again as long as i live!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Katie, Kateo, Courtney and I decided to catch the rapido into town and climb cerro san cristobel (yes... it feels like every single place i have visited so far has one of these hills with the same name!!!), which is the large hill overlooking town with a large jesus statue on top that lights up at night. We got directions and started up the stairs and boy was it hard work!!! I started to feel a bit dodgy and light headed, but as we had not done many stairs in altitude, just uphill I didnt think too much of it. Unfortunately I started feeling quite sick, so I didnt really get to appreciate the view, but apparantly it was quite nice! I somehow made it down and we lined up to get a seat at Jacks cafe where we could get a safe cool drink and a rest. All started going pear shaped so the girls managed to hail a cab to take me home to bed for the day. Later that night I woke up feeling slightly better so dosed up on the drugs and headed out for dinner with the gang. We found a traditional little restaurant just off plaza de armas offering a 5 course meal for 10 soles (about 3.50/4 dollars) and began the feast. Unfortunately by the time the first course had arrived I was really under the weather again and jumped in a cab to head home. In Cusco there are official cabs, but also a lot of unoffical cabs. I wasnt really looking when I jumped in and the dodgy driver tried to tell me it would cost over double the price it should have. I managed to get him to stop the cab by opening the door and jumping out and found a proper cab to take me home. By this time I was feeling really awful and luckily Ash and Toby were home when I staggered in and managed to get hold of the doctor to come out after a few problems with the phones! I dont actually remember that much, but he thought i had appendicities and pneumonia, which turned out to be wrong luckily! After several phone calls he managed to find a hospital with a free bed to take me to to hook me up to a drip with lots of drugs to fix my fainting, crazy fever, resting pulse rate of 130, infection, stomach cramps, headaches, salmonella, cough, cold, acute bronchitis, gardia, parasites, amoebas and you name it!!

The first parts are all a bit of a haze, but the nurses were lovely in the hospital, in their crazy fluro blue uniforms, even if I was cringing at them reusing the same needles, tossing them back into the drawer and pulling them out again the next time... at least i had a room to myself, so I knew they were no one elses! The drip system was about a zillion years old and I was wondering how much damage all the massive air bubbles they pumped directly into my veins caused! The pole the drip was on also didnt actually move as expected as it and I took a stack to the floor the first time I tried to get up! Their techniques were also not quite what I expected as they quickly pumped medicines directly into the drip in my arm at full speed. I have never experienced anything so painful!!! Luckily with a little spanish and lots of screaming I managed to get them to do it either really slowly, or just into the bag at the top by the end of my stay!!

I have no idea what kind of ward I was in, but once I pressed the buzzer, the nurses literally dropped everything to come running within a few seconds which was really bizarre, compared to my last experience in Australia! I also had the privledge of getting the old fashioned x ray system working and experiencing first hand the interesting way of handling specimens in little styrofoam cups with no lids!

On arrival, the doctor made Kate, the girl that came with me take everything back to the house with her as I was not allowed to keep anything valuable in case it was stolen.. It was a loooooooong few days without a watch that is for sure! There was a tv in the room which was pretty unexpected, but nice!! but no remote control and too high for anyone to reach, so the nurse had to get a pen and jump to hit the buttons to switch it on or off which was interesting to try and watch! I had lovely visits from my Perus Challenge housemates with flowers, books, good wishes and some food snuck in as well and got to hear stories of how the others at the house were all starting to come down with sicknesses as well.

A crazy little guy came in each day as well with felt slippers on his feet running in circles around the room to polish the wooden floors which was quite amusing, but being unable to shower as the drip couldnt disattach, or even take off my jumper without pulling it over the entire system and nothing but dried white bread, rice and carbohydrates, carbohydrates, carbohydrates for food, I was glad to finally get out of there after 4 days without scurvy!

The doc picked me up and we arrived back at the house to find the walking wounded everywhere! A few with scabies, the rest with salmonella, giardia, colds, parasites and every other disease you could think of as well! ...At least we are keeping the doctor in business!

Thanks to everyone for the messages on my board as well, it was so nice to get them all when I arrived home this morning feeling a little the worse for wear!!! k xxxx

I was feeling a bit disappointed as I felt I had missed so much of the experience with a week sick and not doing anything, so I was determined to be better by thursday to go horse riding to Incan Ruins with Selby, one of the cofounders of Peru`s Challenge. We got fitted up with out sure footed mules, even if they did have some severe gas problems! and began riding through the most amazing countryside to get to the first Incan ruins. We began at Tambomachay which has a water fountain running constantly all year around and no one knows where the water comes from. It is beautiful, clear and clean and you can drink it if you wish. It is also said by the local people that it gives fertility. Luckily the rain stayed away as we moved just down the road to the Pukapukara remains of a control tower down the valley. It was absolutely gorgeous and just amazing how the Incans managed to move such large rocks to such positions and keep them in place with no tools, equipment or mortar. Back onto the horses through another gorgeous valley and to the Q`engo Incan ruins where a rock is carved so that on the day of the winter solstice on 24 June, the sun shins in a way that is casts a shadow of a sitting Puma (The puma, condor and snake are important creatures in Incan mythology). It must have taken so many years to figure that out as it only happens on that one day a year!! Inside, there was also a sacrifical altar in an icy cold rock room, (which was best for the sacrificies!) which was also built in a way that on the solstice, the whole room would be lit up by the sun. Pretty amazing!

We then headed down to a giant lunch at los perros, `the dogs` cafe, which, true to its name had several dogs running everywhere inside, south american style! Next stop was the Saqsaywaman incan ruins, which is quechan language, but sounds like `sexy woman` when pronounced. This was amazing. We began by heading into a rock tunnel which was an ancient Incan pasageway to use to travel or escape from danger. It was sooo unbelieveably pitch black, cold, dark and small, but just amazing how they managed to use them to get places! The tunnels are everywhere under the city and surrounds and you could get lost for weeks in them! Viewing the ancient formations, we came across a giant rock slippery dip which we all had a go on and was awesome fun! ... well, except the bit in the middle that quickly and unexpectedly hit a perpendicular angle and made it difficult to move your coxic at the end... but awesome! The saqsaywaman ruins are still being uncovered by archeologists each day and they are just absolutely amazing.

The grounds at Saqsaywaman were so massive as well! We walked around and heard all the most interesting stories about it all. All around built into the rocks were also shapes of llamas, guinea pigs, snakes, puma`s, it was unbelieveable how the Incans managed to do it all... especially with the size of some of the rocks!!! Absolutely massive!!!

We walked up the giant Incan staircases (I have no idea why all their staircases were like that as they were only short people!) and the ruins ended on a peak with the most amazing view of Cuzco!! Certinainly an amazing race the Incans!

After my first day out in a week, I was exhausted! But a fantastic day learning about the Incans from Selby and seeing their amazing feats. 
 Friday morn was finally off to the school for the first time in a week...but taking it really easy!!! I started with a grade 4 english class with Stu. It took a few minutes, but we actually got them under control, listening to us and doing what we asked!! success!! Ii guess it just takes a few times to figure out the best way to get through to them. We taught parts of the body and took them for a few games of the hokey pokey and heads, shoulders, knees and toes which they all really enjoyed. We also had to get them all to write down their name, age and birthday for monitoring their health to use for weigh ins and health check ups to find the 20 most vulnerable children to put on a program... that was an effort, but we got there in the end!! 

 

We also had a Peregrine tour group come through to see the school, what Peru`s Challenge is achieving and to observe us taking lessons etc. It definately really made me realise just how cool it is really is what i am doing as they took photos an filmed stu and I teaching english to the kids!

 

Next I was scheduled on for PE with the grade 5 and 6`s. Linda, Alvin and Toby came up with the game where you tie a balloon around an ankle and then have to break the other people`s balloons which they just soooo loved! We all got in and played as well which was really fun.

 

A bit of painting was required before we went home as the handyman at the school was working on Peruvian time and took about 3 hours to mix it up so nothing had been done all day on the talleres building. Absolutely exhausted it was time to head home down the windy road only to round a corner and come face to van front with a team of men felling trees across the road! They all yelled and put up their hands for us to stop and we came to a stop about a metre away whilst they pulled the tree down, chainsawed it into pieces, stacked them on the side of the road, waved us through and started on the next one! ....crazy! I then had a late spanish lesson with spanish charades before crashing...early!!


 

 
Cuzco, the Sacred Valley, Pisac and Pumamarca

2008-04-19 to 2008-04-24


 

Saturday saw most the house going for a hike, but unfortunately I was still not well enough to participate.... Although the massive painful lump in my arm from the drip was finally dissipating! yay! Instead I caught the collectivo into town to look at the artesian markets which was really fun to wander around, speak spanish to the storeholders and buy a few little things. There was a problem with one of my flights so unfortunately I spent a few hours sitting in the LAN office waiting with half of Cusco to speak to one of 2 consultants, but actually worked it out easily enough in the end.

 

I visited a textiles museum that was a very interesting history of textiles in Peru and lots of items to look at and also watch ladies weaving... the only free museum of the day and the only one actually worth visiting! I then headed to the Museo deSito del Qoricancha which had about 2 pages of spanish per exhibit and a small paragraph of english... a little something was missed in the translation i think somehow!! It did have an interesting exhibit on how babies heads were put in kind of a brace after birth so their skulls would grow in the kind of sloped more ape type manner in order to have greater prestige in the community which was interesting.

I then ran into Sarah and we walked to the Museo de Arte y Monasterio de Santa Catalina which is an old cathedral with 12 nuns from one of the oldest orders in the world iving there. The building was being renovated, but there was a beautiful church that was used by the nuns and blocked by locked gates with gorgeous paintings that reminded me of where Maria got married in the Sound of Music!... only 10 times smaller!

Heading through the Plaza de Armas, I walked up a typical little Incan street which is very narrow and very steep with cobblestones and massive rock walls to Plaza San Blas which had an artesian market on. I wandered around and talked to some lovely friendly storeholders again... everyone here loves kangaroos it seems, as soon as they found out I was from Australia, the conversation always seemed to head to kangaroos!!

Heading back down the street I visited some other stalls and found a `beauticians`! I figured how bad could it be?!! So headed on up. I finally located a lady sleeping with her baby out the back and explained what I was after. After waiting for about 15 mins she finally returned with a chinese food container full of this lumpy green wax that looked like seaweed and proceeded to place it directly on my skin. Only later did I realise it had just come off the stove out of the saucepan and they had been melting it for the past 15 mins! And Oh my gosh did I yell as it it burned!!!!!! And due to the type of wax it was there was nothing they could do until it set cold and they could pull it off!! oww!! There was again about another 10 mins or so wait whilst (again I realised this later!!) they put the wax back in the saucepan on the stove and remelted it to reuse!!! She then covered my entire leg in one thick lumpy mess and ripped it off in one hit! This was then repeated until I left there over an hour and a half later with red underarms and lower legs, with chucks of hair and wax everywhere!! And yes... I have definately learnt my lesson about third world country `beauticians`!!

 

Saturday night all the Peru`s Challenge gang headed out to the Witches Kitchen Restaurant in the centre of town. We had a great night sitting around chatting, even if the food did take forever to come out! Most people weren`t happy with their meals, but I managed to pick well so it was awesome for me! The Peru`s Challenge founders Jane and Selby also joined us afterwards which was awesome to chat to them and we then walked to a bar to have a drink before heading home earlyish as no one wanted to get any sicker before Machu Picchu!!

After a lazy start on Sunday, Sarah and I headed to the San Sebastian Markets again to buy fresh fruit and veg for the week. This time I walked around the whole markets and came across the meat section with whole chickens, pigs trotters, sheep heads, cow noses and you name it just sitting there ready to be brough and cooked. Mmmm mm!!! And boy did it smell too!!!

I also had another check up with Dr Victor tofind I had more amoeba`s and got more drug again! It is unbelieveable how easy it is to catch bugs in this country!!

That evening Sarah, Courtney and I headed into the Centro Qosqo de Arte Nativo Danzas Folkloricas which was a show of native dances from around Cuzco with dancers in beautiful bright traditional costumes. We soon realised it was the same dancers each time quickly changing costumes as the MC explained the next dance as we recognised their faces and then noticed minor adornments missing from their costumes in the rush! It was interesting to watch them all and we were really glad that they didntcontinue them all in the scary masks they first started in as well!

Monday morning was the first day everyone was trying to be well for as Selby was taking us all on a tour of the Sacred Valley. Unfortunately it was not to be for Ash and Stu as both were too sick to continue on and had to return back to Cuzco.

We arrived at the first Incan ruins at Chinchero and found a bitterly bitterly cold wind!! We went through a really old Incan church with lovely decorations, before seeing amazing Inca terraces that are still being uncovered and also seeing fragments of Incan ceramics on the site. The Incans were also able to plant potatoes and then walk over them constantly to dehydrate them which meant that they could then be stored for about 30 years! Amazing! There were also ladies in traditional dress making weavings and dying materiels with traditional methods using plants and cochenial.

We stopped at a lookout over the Sacred Valley which was just unbelieveable and then had the most amazing picturesque drive down the valley to the most beautiful restaurant on the river where we had an amazing buffet lunch.

Ollantaytambo Incan Ruins were next as the Incan Terraces just became more and more spectacular as we climbed to the top and admired the way the Incans had moved different MASSIVE rocks from different mountains in the area to the top of these terraces for different temples they were building. Unfortunately some of them weren`t finished when the Spanish arrived, and the ones that were the spanish destroyed them all. From the ruins, the mountain in front also had Incan storerooms and various trails across and up it. It had a face carved on the rock in the centre, and then on the top left hand side of the mountain there was an amazing profile shot of an Incan warrier carved into the rock!! Unbelieveable!!!!!!!

Chicha is a very common drink here, made of fermented corn and our next stop was a local Chicha bar to try this! We first toasted MamaPacha, or mother earth by tipping some onto the floor, and then we drank...but not much! The taste is like flat old beer with corn, The strawberry one was much better! We also played a local game where you stand 2 metres back and attempt to throw gold coins into a brass frogs mouth for the top score, or into holes around it for other points for the first to 15000 ... kind of similiar to darts, quite hard and lots of fun!

By this stage it was dark and we were told to buckle up (a rarity in South America!) for the drive and we could see why as various bulls,cows,sheep, people, kids, bikes and you name it jumped out onto the road in front of us. We also came across several flaming tin cans on the road we had to swerve around that were in front of piles of rocks!! Crazy!!!!!

Our hotel, the Royal Inca Hotel, Pisac was gorgeous! (www.theroyalinkahotel.com) Even if it did take a while to figure out how to make the hot water work!! We then headed to Ulrike`s Cafe in central Pisac for a 3 course dinner... even though I have no idea how we ate after our gourmet lunch!! And then admired the amazing moon and clouds!

The next day dawned bright and sunny... short weather!!! woohoo!! And for the first time in a week actually felt well again!!! double woohoo!!!After brekky we walked around the hotel grounds which were spread across 2 sides of the road and had a sauna, olympic swimming pool, soccer field, volleyball, amazing gardens, and much much more! We also found a llama just sitting outside waiting for photos!!

We drove up to the Pisac Incan Ruins which were the biggest and best and most spectacular by far, admiring the Incan terraces and then the cemetery, which was tombs of mummies all along, around, and inside one of the hills. We walked along narrow Incan paths with sheer drops off to the side and then through another tiny Incan tunnel through the rock to another side. The views were amazing, and their were ruins everywhere you looked, with control towers, where they signalled each other with flags or with conch shells, and also one in the shape of a bird. There ware sundials, purification waterfalls and also half an Incan cross carved into the rock that was then completed by shadows from other carved rocks on the 21 June, the winter solstice. Amazing! We also saw a tower on the top of the mountain where people who did not adhere to the beliefs of the Incan Cross (see below) would be pushed off and if they survived (nearly impossible!) they would be very injured and not be able to live normally and that would be their punishment.

 

We also learnt the siginifance of the Incan Cross which is 12 sided. The first three represent the Puma, Snake and Condor. These all have meanings to the Incans, such as the snake being the intelligence, and the others having meanings as well. The next three are the laws or beliefs of the Incans that they need to abide by, Don`t lie, Don`t steal and Don`t be lazy. The next three mean today I work for you, tomorrow you work for me, and the following day we work together. The final three are the past life, the present life and the future life. And there is a hole in the middle that represents Cuzco as the centre of the earth. Pretty cool really!

 

The dark clouds had begun to gather and so we began our hike to Pisac along an Inca trail and down lots and lots of steep stairs. It was awesome! We also saw Incan Terraces in the shape of womens breasts in thanks to Mama Pacha (mother earth) that are still all in use today for farming. It was perfect timing as the rain began as we hit Pisac and we arrived into Ulrike`s for lunch just as it began to pour!

After lunch the rain had stopped and we walked outside to begin to explore the massive Pisac markets for afew hours. They were great! With so many things to buy as well so we had a fantastic afternoon wandering around before catching the bus home.

We found out Ash and Toby had both gone to hospital, so I headed in with Pete via the collectivo to visit. Ash`s room was similiar to mine, but Toby had the worst!!! His bed was broken and on an angle, his buzzer didnt work, his drip had no wheels, his tiny window opened to a brick wall, there was a really scary picture of jesus witha patient on an operating table, the whole room was sterile white and it was so awful it was funny!! well... not so much for Stu, but for the vitisitors anyway!

I also found out that the hospital costs between US400 and US800 a night... thank goodness for travel insurance!!

Wednesday was back up to the school, firstly for construction in the talleres building, and then helping out with relay races with the kinder PE class. There was a staff meeting that ran overtime so we spent a while playing with the kids until it was over and there was only about 15 mins of our next PE lesson for the 1and 2`s, so just did some more relay races before heading home.

We had a great spanish lesson in the afternoon before having our meeting on the Inca trail!!!! It is so close, it is getting exciting!!!

Thursday was voluntary construction, but most of us spent the day resting up, refusing to get sick, and getting ready for the Inca trail! Thursday afternoon was the last opportunity to head to Talleres, the womens workshop group, as I had missed the other visits whilst I was ill. Picking up Iris, the social worker, Jane (the founder of Perus Challenge), Sara and I headed to the school to find literally hundreds of women and children all waiting for us sitting around knitting and making various handmade crafts. It was just amazing. The group was started by Jane and Iris in Pumamarca so the women had a chance to get away from their houses, learn a new skill and make some money by selling the finished goods. The other main purpose was to allow the women to make friends withint eh community, chat and also allow the community, Iris and Perus Challenge to find out if there were any problems in the home they could assist with. The group started with about 12 members and now has over 150! It was so amazing!

Sara and I registered in the goods, such as beanies, scarves, bracelets, blankets and all sorts of other handmade items and then issued out the equipment, such as knitting needles and wool. It was really crazy and full on with people everywhere pulling us in every which direction and before we knew it, a few hours had passed and we had to tear ourselves away, pack up and head home ready for Machu Picchu!

 

 

 

 
Machu Picchu!

2008-04-25 to 2008-04-28


After wondering for weeks whether or not I would make it in the end... and doing everything I could to possibly avoid another parasite, amoeba, or any other Peruvian bug you can think of, for the first time in over a month we were woken up by our alarm clocks in the pitch black, ready to grab our backpacks and leave on the bus at half past 6 to Machu Picchu!!

Picking up various guides, porters and who knows who else along the way we stopped in Ollantaytambo to purchase any last minute essentials, such as hiking sticks, and then we were dropped off at KM 82 to begin our walk! Through the checkpoint with passports stamped, we were already amazed by the massive mountains and amazing scenery. Day 1 was a fairly relaxed 12 km ofÁndean flat´!!!! with a stop at Llactapata Incan ruins, lunch and then overnight in Wayllamba where the porters had run past us on the trail and set up everything ready. We explored some more ruins in the afternoon and were amazed at the view we had to wake up to!! Even it was some of the absolute hardest ground that I had ever slept on! This was also one of the first experiences we had with the squat toilets along the way.... you could smell them a good 20m away. Nice!!

Day 2 was the big one with lots and lots up uphills. I was determined to carry my pack and so opted out of the optional use of a porter for the day... a decision I did start to regret as we climbed our way up and up hundreds of giant incan stairs to reach the highest point on the Inca Trail, the peak at Warmiwanusca at over 4000m. It was so hard! and absolutely freezing cold at the top as we were in the clouds, but so amazing. We then began some downhill andÁndean flat´again, admiring the amazing scenery and snow capped mountains before arriving in the early afternoon at our campsite for the evening ready for lunch and to put on all the clothes we owned ready for an absolutely freezing night. We overlooked a valley and watching the different cloud formations and colours on our personal´television´over the snow capped mountains was definately one of the most amazing ways you could spend an afternoon!

Indulging in some UNO before dinner the cold became more and more intense as we struggled to eat the strangest meal i have seen in some time with mini meatwheels with a piece of hotdog on the inside, some interesting mini dried fish and cheese roll and hard cold rice. mmmm mmm!!

Day 3 was the loooooongest day of some uphill, some´Andean flat´and then over 5000 downhill Incan steps! We began with the ruins at Runkuraqay and then began the uphill to the next peak. During the day we went through 2 Incan rock tunnels which I just love! We saw the Incan ruins at Sayaqmarka, Phuyupatamarka and also our first glimpse of Machu Picchu mountain! Along the way the guides also pointed out a lot of amazing flowers that grow along the trail. The day dragged though!! It felt like we were walking downhill forever as we finally we able to glimpse our campsite for the evening and the rain started. luckily it only lated long enough to give us a beautiful rainbow and we finally stumbled into the final campsite at Wiñaywayna in the late afternoon.

We had the opportunity for a hot shower which was certianly worth the 5 soles! before settling in for some UNO before the most amazing final dinner feast. We had about 8 different amazing dhises that the cooks and porters must have spent all day preparing. We then met all the porters learnt a bit about them, their role and what they carried before thanking them for their efforts and heading off to bed with the dark ready for the next day!!

Our wake up call began at 4am as we quickly packed up, breakfasted and headed down in the dark to the first checkpoint. Lining up for about half an hour we were then allowed through to begin the final walk to Machu Picchu, watching the amazing sunrise over the massive mountains. The walk was beautiful and the final, super steep set up stairs we needed both hands and feet for pulled us up to arrive at the Sun Gate and our first glimpse of Machu Picchu!

About another 40 mins later we passed through the Intipunku ruins and arrived at the lost Incan City, checked our backpacks, received our final passport stamp and began our tour! The site was massive and so amazing, but unfortunately like all the photos of the trek, they just can´t portray the colours and depth that you can see. We walked through the terraces, tombs, the most amazing sound room that you can put your face in one of the niches and hum and the sound just echoes around the whole room. It sounds pretty amazing just one person, but fantastic when everyone did it at once! There was so much to see with the sun dials, sacrifical altar, condor rock, incan tunnel, the botanical gardens, the compass rock, the carved mountain rock and all the different rooms, but too soon the tour was finished and we could explore ourselves. After wandering around, Courtney and I found some comfy Incan walls to sit on and just enjoy the amazing views and Machu Picchu experience. We also saw a condor flying which we were pretty excited about as it is a sacred bird for the Incans.

Too soon it was time to head to the bus, but unfortunately our plans were a little foiled as we missed several buses waiting for the ticket lady who was in the bathroom apparantly washing her hair! We finally made it on one and drove the zigzag road down to the tiny town of Aguas Calientes to meet the rest of the group for lunch and then catch the train back to Ollantaytambo. Exhausted, we moved to our bus and arrived back home to Cuzco ready for a hot shower and real toilet!

It was absolutely amazing and I hope you guys all love (all the billion and one!) of my pic´s as much as I loved doing it all. It feels like so long ago writing now, it was really hard to capture it, but I will reread it again when I have had some more sleep!!!! We were also lucky that we had such a great little group walking with Pete, Stu, Courtney, Chris and I just having a great time!! It all seemed to go so quickly... (well, maybe not about downhill step number 4050 to 5000!!!) but so fantastic!!! thanks for all the messages about it too! love k xxx

 
Farewell Pumamarca, Hola Lake Titicaca

2008-04-30 to 2008-05-03


Tuesday was our final free day in Cuzco, so we spent it recovering from the walk, beginning packing and also trying to post all our excess stuff or gifts back home!! It was quite amusing walking into teh post office to find half the other volunteers there with sticky tape and boxes everywhere trying to sort everything out! The staff were so friendly and helpful though and it was such an easy process... even if you did have to be fingerprinted like a common criminal with the marks then put onto the front of the postbox! The ink didnt want to come off too easily either as we then had to walk around town with it all day! Stu, Pete, Chris, Courtney and I headed into Jacks for a massive feast before checking out the South American Explorers Club which was really really cool!

As I was heading off early, we got some Chinese takeaway from around the corner, whose staff were very surpirsed to see a group of foreigners walk in... exclaiming´gringo´s!!!! very loudly as we did which was quite amusing! The 10 mins wait streched into 10 mins Peruvian time as we received our meals, cooked by Peruvians and were actually pleasantly surpirsed at just how good it actually was!! Really fresh and light and with great flavours... not at all like chinese from home though!!

We spent a great night eating, drinking and chatting into the morning, before getting up for our final day of school!

Chris and I had a grade 4 art class first thing and the kids were so excited with the pipe cleaners and beads they amazed us with their immaginations and made the most amazing animals and creations and behaved themselves all lesson!!!! before we all made crazy glasses to wear.

We helped out with some construction and the final PE classes before the whole school assembled for the director to thank us, and then the children to take turns saying a speech or singing a song which was so lovely. Some of the kids even wore their glasses they made with us in class which was so cool!!! We then all received a bunch of flowers from the kids, a handmade card, a certificate from Peru´s Challenge and then a hug from practically every single kid at the school!! It was all amazing and then we were suprised by a lunch feast as well with fresh trout, salad and potatoes cooked in the ground!

Finalising all our packing, we all headed into town to Fallen Angels for dinner and drinks which was really nice. Unfortunately too soon it was time to say goodbye, which was quite sad as I had met some really lovely people in vol group, but I am sure we will all meet again! The night was over for me at teh restaurant though as the food came late, I quickly scoffed it down and ran with Selby through town to find a cab to the bus terminal. The dodgy driver dropped me off halfway down the street as he had found another fare and I headed to the station with minutes to spare before my 10pm bus, only to find a MASSIVE queue to pay the departure tax.... of one sole !!!! I mean really! What is it with Peru and crazy taxes? It would cost more money to employ the staff and buy the fancy stickers they put on your ticket!!!

Finding the bus, I was then fingerprinted before I was allowed on and found my allocated seat occupied by half an obese man! darn it!! I was in for a long overnight bus ride! Luckily halfway through the night I managed to get the armrest down so that contained him somewhat!!! It was really weird though as the lights kept going on and off and the bus kept stopping which made me think i had missed the stop half the time! So confusing! And i still dont know why!! Arriving at Puno at about 5am I grabbed a cab to the hostel I had booked... and confirmed they would have a staff member available... to find it all shut up and no one answering the bell!! Wandering the streets I found a policeman and (attempted to!!) explain my situation and asked if he could find me an open hostel!! Luckily there was one close by and we managed to wake up the staff member to let me in for a few hours sleep... and even nicer and cheaper tha the original hostel!

At 20 past 7 I dragged myself out onto the street only to find no available cabs! I finally found a little mototaxi to take me to begin my next tour!

With the group in tow, we arrived at Puno dock to precariously walk over about 10 boat decks to our allocated boat and begin our tour of Lake Titicaca! The first view of the floating islands of Uros, made entirely of reeds was just amazing! The reed weeds are teh base for the island and the islands just keep piling the reeds on top! They build houses and boats out of the reeds and anchor themselves to stop the islands floating away. It was so interesting! And the islands are so spongy to walk on it felt like if you jumped you would just fall through into the water below! They are actually really strong though. We visited a few islands, talked to the people and looked at their beautiful handicrafts before catching one of the reed boats, powered by 2 of the little girls with oars! Needlesss to say it was a slow ride, but very very cool!

After about 3 hours back in our regular boat, we arrived at the island of Amantani were we were split up into pairs and allocated families for the night whi still live in traditional ways as they have done for hundreds of years! A Costa Rican lady, Martha and I stayed with a lovely lady called Filomena, her son Diego and her parents in a mud brick house at the top of the island with gorgeous views over the lake and into the snow capped mountains of Bolivia. The family had a garden they farmed various vegetables they used for our meals, no running water or electricity and a little outhouse right at the bottom of the garden!!

After a fresh lunch of quinea soup with vegetables and more rice and potatoes than I ever want to see again we struggled up the high hill behind the houses in the high altitude to play soccer with the local children before continuing up the hill to watch the sunset. It was amazing! It was about a 40min climb, and we had a clear view over the entire lake, back to Peru and over to Bolivia. Unfortunately my camera decided to die so I dont really have many photos, but it was just absolutely amazing. And freezing cold!!!! about minus2!!

We stumbled our way down the little cobblestone streets in the dark to have another veg soup and rice for dinner and a little light from a globe lit by solar panels. Unfortunately this didnt last long and we were soon in candlelight which was pretty cool! We also had Muña tea which consisted of a cup of boiling water and then a stalk of this herb picked fromt he garden and placed in it! I was reliabily informed it was oregano... yes, as in like the herb you put on pizza! which was interesting, but I am still not convinced! Our host mother then arrived to dress us in traditional clothes and take us to the fiesta, which proved a nightmare trying to navigate the pitch black in the traditional dress that was bound so tight around my ribs i could barely breathe!!!

We sepnt the night listening to traditional andean music by the community and dancing in crazy lines around the dance floor at full pelt with all the locals which was cool!

I was shattered though after no sleep the night before and a big day of adventure so soon it was time to stumble home and into bed which actually turned out to be one of the warmest and most comfortable nights I have had in a long time!

Fri morn it was time to say goodbye and head over to Taquile Island about 40 mins away. We were dropped off on one side and spent the next hour hiking and looking at the most amazing views off the island... again my camera was still dead, but some lovely people on the tour are going to send me some pics!! It was gorgeous!! We arrived at the centre plaza which was so much smaller than I expected for a´tourist island´! A few mud brick buildings and a textile´shop´! It was really nice to see they hadn´t been changed by all the tourists though. We learnt about the island and culture and traditional dress before a fresh lunch and another hike down to the other side of the island... with 500 downhill steps our guide was quite worried about!! nothing after the inca trail!!!

Arriving back in Puno, one of the guys, an American named Ken, kindly let me share his room to have a hot shower!!! sooo good! We then wandered around Puno and i tried my luck attempting to get drugs for the latest parasite I had picked up!!! I a hoping they stop following me once I leave Peru!!!!!!!!!!!! About half an hour later I got something... some kind of drugs... hopefully it doesnt make it worse anyway!!!! And we continued around Puno, which was a cool little city to look at before meeting some of the group for dinner at the Plaza de Armas. We then ended up at La Choza de Oscar, which was 2 doors from the hotel! handy! Ken and I decided to share the Alpacker steak... and Cuy! Which is the Peruvian delicacy of guinea pig. The Alpacker steak was so fantastic, it is definately one of my new favourite foods... and the guinea pig´s head was definately a little scary to look at, but once I covered the eyes it made it a bit easier... (sorry Bern!!!!) it was so little!!! And the meat was brown and i think kind of like duck, but very hard to actually pinpoint as it has such a flavour of its own. I could only manage a little paw though!! Psychological though i think!!! who would have known a few months ago i never even ate meat!?!??!!!!

A show then came on with a traditional Andean band who proceeded to play and sing La Bamba along with all the audience!! Profesor Ivan and Señor Barrett I was thinking of you guys!! (It was one of the songs we learnt together in Spanish in Timor last year!) Again too soon it was time to say goodbye, grab my bags and head back to the terminal for the overnight bus from Puno to Cuzco, arriving back about half past 4 am and heading back to the Vol house to grab my backpack. Madly repacking i rushed outside to meet my transfer... and waited... and waited... and waited! I hiked down to the main road and found a cab that got me there in enough time though luckily! Puno to Cuzco, Cuzco to Lima, Lima to Buenos Aires... I arrive over 24 hours after I left Puno... a long day of travelling, and soooo tired, but ready to start my next adventure, my tour through Argentina, Uraguay and Buenos Aires with Tucan!! I cant wait to meet all the new people and see the sights!

Hasta Luego!!!! Tired K xxxxx

 
Civilisation! Buenos Aires, Argentina to Colonia, Montevideo, Salto, Uruguay, San Ignacio, AR

2008-05-04 to 2008-05-09


 

 

 

Arriving late into Buenos Aires I ran around in circles for a while trying to find a non existent ATM (again thanks to some not so helpful advice!) before chatting with a very friendly cabby on the way to the hotel who decided that he would take me out to dinner and be my tour guide in BA and that I should meet his single english speaking son! He then proceeded to call his son on his mobile and passed the phone over so I could speak to him!! Apparently I am to call as soon as i arrive back in BA from my tour.... hilarious!!

 

As I had arrived late from my mega journey, I met the group over a breakfast of dulce de leche, croissants and cake. amongst other things.... I have no idea how everyone is not obese here!! We have an awesome mix of people from all over the world on the tour though and everyone gets along really well so it is looking like a fantastic trip!

 

So nice to be in the semi warmth and out of the altitude as well we headed to the port to board the Boquebus (which is not a bus, but a boat!!) to Colonia, Uruguay after some really bad and lengthy spanish fast talking I managed to get off my Australian passport and onto my NZ one... so now I will be able to get into Brazil!!woohoo!! My only concern is getting off it again in BA as I need to use my Aus onee for my flight to Mexico as they dont like the fact they are both in different names... especially after my last experience with the police in Chile!! oh well! Fingers Crossed!

 

The ferry was MASSIVE!!! It was honestly so unbelievably huge and also entirely full. In fact, so full we ended up with first class tickets which was definitely a nice surprise! Leaving the big city of BA on the Rio de la plata we heard tango singers sing live on the boat before pulling into the lovely old and green city of Colonia in Uruguay. It was hilarious trying to get our bags as all the locals did their normal trick of standing as close as they possibly could to the carousel so no one else could even see, let alone grab their bags! We finally joined the mass of people who were actually it turned out in some kind of uruguayan version of `lines` to go through customs. So chaotic!!!!

 

Our tour is an adventure tour using local transport and really getting to know the feeling of the places so it was no surprise when our transport to our accommodation was via foot! It was a beautiful walk through the old picturesque cobbled streets with gorgeous oak trees and cars from about the 1920`s or so! And the accommodation!! Our Poseda de los flores was gorgeous with a lovely courtyard and due to being of spanish architecture had the flat roof with a lovely rooftop terrace!

 

Walking around we saw the differences in the spanish and portuguese architecture before setting in for a traditional chavita lunch–kind of hamburger thing! The city was so gorgeous as we made the most of the beautiful scenery and laid back lifestyle before heading home for sunset drinks on the rooftop terrace! ahh!! this is definitely the life!!!

 

Heading off on the bus to Montevideo, Uruguays capital in the morning we arrived to find a bigger city, but still with gorgeous architecture and the same laidback lifestyle... even the motorists didnt feel the urge to constantly beep which was an unbelievably nice change from the rest of South America!

 

A city tour led us to this amazing restaurant for lunch where we were treated to 3 delicious courses for less than 200 pesos ...probably about the equivalent of 10 dollars! Quince is really big here and dessert was a quince pie...which turned out to be biscuit base filled with quince jam! literally just half an inch of jam! interesting... VERY very sweet.... but definitely no `Mrs Jacobs Jams and jellies`!

 

The city is also just so beautiful!! It is interesting too because if I was not traveling as part of a tour I would never have just chosen to come here, but I think it is actually by far my favourite country in south america!! I am definitely coming back here that is for sure...in fact we were discussing plans at lunch on the best way to immigrate here!! Strolling, there was also this big parilla which was a huge warehouse type of thing with just heaps and heaps of stalls selling barbequed meat!! Just kilos and kilos of meat!!! and them just trying all they can to get you to eat!!! Soooo much meat!

 

 

 
Civilisation part 2!

2008-05-09


 



As Uruguay apparently has fantastic ice cream we just had to give it a try... and it was definitely good!!! A strange guy dressed as a doctor also tried to tak eour blood pressure but we managed to avoid him... what kind of scam it was we wern`t sure, but it was vry weird none the less. And then the rooftop hotel in the Radisson was recommended as well.... panoramic views of the city and mojitio`s... yes I could definitely get used to this life!!

 

We spent the evening at `the best tango show in Montevideo` and boy, if this was the best I would die if I was trying to watch the worst!!! Far out!! It was soooo slow and the performers just kept laughing the whole time. In the about hour and a half we suffered through there were only 2 tango dances and geez did the girls make it look hard as they struggled through the steps,...not exactly the beautiful effortless dancing we had hoped for!! Nor the billion traditional songs that were sung on superloud!!! ahhh so painful!!! I am still not entirely sure why there was a large black african american woman in traditional southern USA dress either! It was interesting to see though the pride the girls had with their very full figures, especially as they wore very small dancing costumes!

 

Tuesday morning we again enjoyed more of the gorgeous city and people and found the most amazing bakery full of windows of cakes,,pastries,biscuits, and more! It also had MEGA sandwiches with bread slices the size of a sheet of paper!!! Awesome! I got what appearedto be a brown bread sandwich...but turned out to be fruit bread!!interesting! A pineapple and ham fruit bread sandwich!! From there it was quickly jamming everything the fastest way we could into our backpacks and running for our taxis. The bus station was also massive so there was lots to look at before boarding the 7 hour bus to Salto... a city tour and..dinner!!! It is almost like we are eating our way around South America!!!!

The next morning was a leisurely breafast of cake and dulce de leche of course! before heading to the Dayman thermal baths where we spent a beautiful day enjoying the star attraction of Salto.

 Time then to explore Salto and Allison and I headed off toward town... or so we thought! Ending up in a gorgeous area full of huge houses with waterviews...but no town! We found a few random men sitting on deck chairs in the street so went to ask directions and their massive dog went crazy as Allison promptly flew in the other direction leaving me all to fend for myself!! Although I definitely wouldn`t want to come across them in a dark alley, it all worked out and it was a nice scenic detour to check out the main street and plaza before meeting the group for dinner... of course! before catching taxi`s about 10pm over the border to Argentina. It felt like we were in the Sound of Music being smuggled in the dead of the night in groups of 3 as we handed over our passports to the driver and sat waiting to be allowed through! The border officials didn`t even want to see us! It took some time but we then arrived at ..... bus station ready for the 1am bus....as we sat waiting and waiting and waiting in the freezing cold. We all let out a sigh of relief about 2am as the bus finally pulled in! The adventure was to continue though as the driver had already filled the luggage hold up with boxes and there was no room for the bags, forcing half the group to take their big backpacks on the bus with them to their seats! Somehow we had managed first class tickets and a bunch of locals had decided that they preferred our seats to theirs and had already settled in for the night. We managed to evict them, but found one had left a nice surprise of hard crunchy biscuits all through my seat...cozy! The bed seats were awesome though which made an easy nights sleep as we arrived at San Ignacio, Argentina the next morning, moving to a local bus for the final part of the journey. 

 

All of San Ignacio is covered in red dirt like central Australia which was different to everywhere else we had been thus far. We were staying right across the road from the ruins of the Jesuit mission which was actually very interesting to walk around and hear the stories of the Jesuit brothers from the mission`s work with the locals. It was a massive walled community, but a very good standard of life. when it was operating. Later that evening there was also a sound and light show at the ruins where everything was lit up with coloured lights and there was really nice music with brothers singing to add to the ambience.

 

A movie starring Robert DeNiro. and Jeremy Irons called `The mission` was filmed In San Ignacio, at the ruins and Iguassu Falls telling the story of the missionaries so we settled in for the evening to watch that which was really interesting considering our location there too!

 

The next morning we all stood by the side of the road awaiting the local bus to El Dorado. It arrived... again the hold was full, but this time so was the bus! Unperturbed we squashed in, bags and all for an interesting ride! I dont think the locals were impressed! Especially when we whizzed by all the next stops without stopping!! We finally arrived at Estacion Las Mercedes ( www.estacionlasmercades.ar ) in Missiones which is a beautiful Argentinean ranch were we relaxed by the pool, swung in hammocks and played ping pong until our lunch asado (Argentinean BBQ) feast with a gorgeous salad spread and where every different type of meat imaginable just kept on coming! There was also tongue on the table which a heap of people ate before figuring out what it was!!! eww!!!it looked soooo gross too! Rolling away from the table very very full we had the option to spend the afternoon horse riding or canoeing. I chose canoeing down the ...... river which was gorgeous! More goodies had been laid out for our return and somehow we manged to tuck into the freshly home baked treats!! We also tried mate which is an Argentinean drink with this special little mug and straw and thermos every single person seems to carry around with them... I think it is an acquired taste though! yuck! And a lot of effort to carry it all around with you all the time (literally they do ALL the time!) but everyone does it and there are free hot water refills for the thermoses around everywhere.

 

Back onto another bus as we headed out to cross the Argentinean border into Brazil! Just when we had mastered (kind of!) Spanish, it was a challenge trying to converse in a whole new language in Portuguese as we arrived in Foz do Iguassu and met two new girls joining the tour. I have never seen a room as compact either as we all squished into cupboard sized spaces and tried not to bump into each other!!

 

 

Grandma... Hi!!... Soles are the peruvian currency and the equivalent exchange rate of about 3 soles to 1 US dollar. A mototaxi is hard to describe! I wish I had taken a pic now!! It is like a small motorbike with kind of like a rickshaw carriage over it where the driver sits in the front and you in the back and you slowly slowly get to your destination!!

 

 
Iguasu Falls to Sao Paulo, Brazil

2008-05-10 to 2008-05-15


 

We were all super excited the next morning as we had our first fruit for breakfast since we had started! It goes without saying here was cake, dulce de leche, cheese and ham still....of course!! But sooooo good to see fruit! Bring on Brazillian eating!!!!! We then entered the tropical bird park, were screeched at by the Macaws, impressed by the flamingos (which interestingly enough had mirrors in their enclosure to trick them into thinking there was more of them as their groups are so large in the wild to create security so that they would breed!) and then absolutely amazed by the tucans!!! The very thing I had been hanging out to see since before arriving in South America!! There were aviaries you could walk through and we were ducking from the massive black birds swooping us when we spied a tucan!!! One then flew down and sat about 20cm from me on the rail!! Unbelievable!! We couldnt have possibly asked for anything better! It was like he knew how much we wanted to see them as he sat there posing for photos!! We were so lucky also as another type also did the same in the next aviary! It looked so fake and comical with its super long coloured beak, like it was drawn on! It took about 10 mins of staring at it moving about before we finally convinced ourselves it was really real!

 

We also had the opportunity to hold a boa constrictor and macaw before jumping in the van to... Iguassu Falls! It was a bit weird to be back surrounded by tourists after not having seen any for pretty much our entire trip was was absolutely awesome, but it really wasn`t even that busy so we were really lucky!! According to local legend, the falls were created by God stamping his foot to the earth after being angry at 2 lovers! Parque Nacional Foz Do Iguassu, Brazil showed us our first spectacular view of Iguassu Falls as we headed down the walkway and continued to amaze us for the next few hours as we followed the walkways for constant spectacular views to arrive at garganta de diablo, the throat of the devil. On a walkway out over the falls as we were sprayed with water and amazed at the power of the falls and the gorgeous rainbow through them. The viewing platforms had slidehows of 2005 when the falls dried up and then 2006 when it all flooded! It was absolutely amazing to think the walkway we had been on minutes before had been almost destroyed with all the water!

 

The Rafains dinner spectacular that evening was a fantastic end to an absolutely brilliant day. In case we hadn`t eaten enough already on this tour already we were treated to a mega buffet as we watched performers from all over latin america, including a fantastic rendition of Evita, fire dancers............., brazillian acrobats, reggae bands, tango and samba dancers and then a brazillian extravaganza at the end with amazing costumes, dancing girls in tiny bikinis and full energy music! Amazing!! There was also this really interesting dessert which looked and tasted like carrot cake batter, but was apparently pumpkin. I put a pic in the photo page after requests for some strange food shots! But it was actually really good! I was then dragged up onto the stage to dance by a crazy local which turned out to be heaps of fun!! I guess it certainly helps that everyone in latin America knows how to dance!!

 

Day two of the falls was another border crossing back into Argentina and began with `the grand adventure` a jungle tour on a jeep before arriving at the river to jump into a speedboat. We then arrived at the falls and circled around to admire them before being plunged under them!!!!! Far out they were powerful and far out were we drenched!!! It was amazing fun though and only really sunk in later when we saw the falls up close and watched another boat go under them how extreme it was!!!

 

My plastic parka had somehow managed to keep me entirely dry, but the others were not so lucky as they spent the next few hours drying off. We caught a boat over to San Martin Island to walk the trials and view the falls before checking out some of the 275 falls on the way to lunch were we were under constant scrutiny by these very tame and game racoon type animals who just wanted to climb all over us to get to our food!

 

The walkways through the park and overlooking all the different falls were gorgeous and took up the rest of the day before catching the train up to the garganta de diablo (the throat of the devil) on the Argentinean side. A huge walkway over the river took us over the top of the falls as millions of litres of water plummeted below. Absolutely amazing! And the roar was deafening!!! We were showered in spray as we stood there stunned and took it all in before it was time to get ready for the night bus to Curitiba.

 

At a more respectable hour of 9pm, I was lucky to get to ride shotgun in the front seats upstairs, but it turned out to be quite awful as we could see every swerve and dodge and strange decision the crazy driver made as we struck potholes non stop the entire night, made sudden swerves that slipped us off our seats and sped like the speed of light, finally arriving with no sleep 2 hours early at 5am!! Luckily the hotel rooms were free so we were able to crash before we began a walking tour of Curitiba. The city is the state capital with 1.7 million people and has been named the world`s most innovative city by the UN. It is also Brazil`s coldest city!!!!! Brrr!!! Just when we thought we were heading to summer!!! We also soon discovered that every single attraction, museum, park, bus and you name it is closed on Mondays!!! The whole city just shuts down!!! It was kind of handy though as we were all so tired so we were just able to wander at leisure for the day before meeting up to head to a Brazillian German restaurant for dinner. According to our German girl Celine it was entirely unauthentic as well!

 

 

We seem to have passed in and out of so many countries it is difficult to keep track of which language we need to speak, money we need to use and where on earth we actually are! It is definitely nice to know now that we are in Brazil for the next week!! I will definitely be glad to hopefully see the back of cheese, ham, dulce de leche, meat, meat, MEAT, fried food and hopefully hello to some more fruit and veggies!! Even if i have noticed so far that all meals seem to come with those little french fry chips that come in packets at the supermarket back home. They call them `minichips` and put them in sandwiches, burgers, under steak, egg or omelette`s, beside pasta... everywhere!

The tour pattern of eating and buses then continued Tues morn as we again gorged on a buffet breakfast.... yes tons of cake! yes cheese and ham!! yes... white bread!! and then jumped on another bus for 6 hours through gorgeous banana and rubber plantations on the way to Sao Paulo!

I wasn`t too sure about Sao Paulo as we arrived to the grey concrete jungle and massive traffic jam starting about an hour out of the city in the middle of the afternoon. It is also the world`s 6 th largest city (after Tokyo, Mexico city, New York, Seoul and Mumbai for all those trivia nuts!) and with a crime rate probably equally as high! Our hotel was situated next to a regular store selling a multiude of weapons and ammunition up to 30mm just sitting in the window...yes nice! and after being warned to be vigilant and stay off the streets after dark we went out for a city walk past armed police in flack jackets and homeless people everywhere. 

 

 

But the city turned out to be great! The train system has absolutely hilarious as we tried to get our group of 17 on and off in the middle of peak hour. So many people everywhere!! The city was originally founded by the Jesuits as an outpost for their missions and it just expanded from there. The original jesuit church building still stands which was really cool. There was a gorgeous cathedral....... in the centre of town and so many fantastic old buildings it was just gorgeous!! We walked past the theatre and found there was an opera so brought tickets to Barba-Azul for 10 real!(about $6!). We were all in our best backpacker travelling clothes so looked more than a little out of place compared to the rest of the well dressed crowd in suits and dresses! Our seats were in the nose bleed section higher than you would think possible! In fact we could only actually see the stage if we leant really far forward! It turned out to to be german with portuguese subitles so apart from a spanish word here and there it didn`t make an awful lot of sense, but the theatre was absolutely amazing, as was the orchestra!

Wandering around the next day we all met up in the Japanese district for lunch. Sao Paulo apparently also has the world`s largest japanese community outside japan! And I must say their sushi was sooooooooooooooooo good! It was a pay per kilo buffet restaurant which is really common here where you fill your plate, put it on the scales and then pay for the weight you are going to eat!

Apart from the gorgeous buildings we also saw some of the city heading to the busy busy, loud and polluted business district on....... and the brazillian stock exchange, ....Bovespa! We just walked in off the street!! It is all automated now, but still pretty cool!

There is also a strange way of advertising jobs here.... people stand in this busy pedestrian mall with sandwich boards on or signs and everyone comes along to read them and apply for jobs!! And not just little part time jobs either, full on professional jobs as well! So weird! You think it would be easier to place an ad in the paper!

We made some new friends in some cool little local places before trying out the japanese karoake bar for the evening and found all sorts of hidden talents in the group!

As we were unable to get into the observation deck on the empire state building replica the day before we rushed out in the morning before the 6 hour bus to Parati.... it was amazing the mass of the city in all directions until lost in the smog!

The security is pretty tight on the buses here with tickets you need to show to collect your bag and also having to have your passport checked to enter. We were also stopped on the side of the road for over 40 mins by the police who came on, checked everyones passports, asked questions and then searched all the locals bags...and none of ours!!! clearly we now all look like backpackers with nothing worthwile!!

 

 

 
Paraty to.... Rio De Janiero!!! Updated!

2008-05-16 to 2008-05-19


 

 Okay this is going to be a really long entry as i had a few hours to kill on a plane to Buenos Aires sorry and i had the devil child behind me so i couldnt sleep!!! 

 

Walking through the gorgeous cobbled streets of the new town we arrived at our poseda in seaside Paraty on the coste verde (green coast) and headed down the street into the old town. Heritage listed colonial town by the UN and separated from the rest of the town by chains so no cars can get in, only people are allowed on foot or with horse and carts!

 

The streets are soooo hard to walk on in the old town!!! Even with joggers, ankles were rolled, peoples slipped and tripped and we all did everything we could to watch each step and stay on our feet!! We brought freshly made caiparianaha`s from Renato at a little stand in the plaza and watched in horror as 2 massive heaped spoons of sugar went into each! without sugar was much more delicious...but strong! We feasted on fresh Brazillian seafood and then roamed the streets in search of the dessert wheelbarrow man with a massive wheelbarrow full of different delicious desserts! Unfortunately he was not to be found after searching the town... even the police helping us at one point!

 

After breakfasting on.... yes...cake and cheese and ham! we walked down the road to get onto our schooner cruise! We had the boat all to ourselves as we left Paraty and headed out amongst the gorgeous islands and pristine beaches. Stopping, we jumped off the side into the crystal clear water and hundreds of fish swam around us as we snorkelled. The perfect day continued with sailing and swimming, walking along deserted beaches and eating delicious fresh fish. Celine and I also found some really exotic fruits high up some trees and entertained ourselves trying to get them off the tree so we could try them! It turns out fruta pao, or bread fruit cant even be eaten without being cooked so all to no avail!

 

On the way to dinner we located the wheelbarrow dessert man.. or hombre de dulce as we called him and feasted. I had the most amazing banana cake covered with real bananas!!! It definitely even rivaled Sentusa`s banana cake in Peru as the best cake ever!! We found a few cool little jewelery items at the markets and again ended up at Renato`s caiparianaha stand before dinner and some more shopping!

 

An amazing feast followed at a fantastic little restaurant... one of the best we meals, waiters, music and atmosphere we had had so far again, and that is saying something with all the eating we have done in the past few weeks!! Checking out the gorgeous little stores we arrived at Renato`s van once again and enjoyed the atmosphere in the plaza and surrounding bars whilst watching the world go by. Such a cool little town!

 

The pattern of eating and buses continued the next morning as we woke at the crack of dawn and climbed again onto a bus... but this time a private transfer! As amazing as the trip has been we are all beginning to feel a bit tired as we all promptly fell asleep. We have sure fitted a lot into into the past weeks!!

 

And finally.... Rio De Janeiro!!! A new hotel and off on a city tour to see Corcovado, the giant hill with Christ the Redeemer over looking the city. The fog as really thick as we made our way to the top and entirely obscured the city, but it was quite eiree to see the giant statue appear and reappear through the mist.

 

Sao Sebastiao Metropolitan Cathedral was one of the strangest cathedrals I have ever seen... like a massive grey concrete beehive! before hitting the sambadrome which is the purpose built street for Carnivale. It is a massive stadium, but just straight along one street instead of being round. During the year, the stands are closed in and used by samba schools to train people for the parade, and when February rolls around, the windows are all taken out and they become boxes and stands! pretty cool! Although Carnivale has only recently finished this year, we stood there are watched as there were already people out training doing the samba for next year! Crazy!!! It must be absolutely amazing to be there though... maybe next year!:+)

 

Sugarloaf mountain was definitely an impressive site as the fog lifted to show us an amazing view of the city and just how beautiful Rio really is. Catching the cablecar we spent ages just walking around taking in the view as the sun set over the city, its beaches, christ the redeemer, the bay and all its beauty.

 

It was our last night as a tour group so we all headed into... you guessed it... an all you can eat buffet!! And again it surpassed all our expectations with the most amazing spread and fantastic sush and fruit!!!! sooooooo good!!! There was music upstairs so Celine and I headed up to dance, only to find astounded locals who proceeded to photograph and film us non stop until we left!!! It was crazy!!! Like we were superstars or something!! We do plan to google `gringos` (the spanish word for white foreigners) and `rio` though and see what comes up!!!! `YMCA` by the Village people also came on as our group all did the traditional dance moves... the locals had I think we started a new trend!!! Although it has been around for like 30 years, the locals had never seen anything like it and started in amazement (in between the photo taking and filming of course!!) and then copied all of us!!! Sooo funny!! They must have thought we were some kind of gurus though as they then proceeded to copy us for all the next songs as well! sooo funny!!

 

Heading into Lapa we mingled with locals at the caiparianaha stands and strolled through town before arriving and queueing at city scenico to enjoy the live brazillian samba music! It is the strangest system though as you are given a handout when you enter with a list of all the items you can buy there on it and then use that to chit up all your purchases during the night...no money changes hands at the bar or anything, just given your drink and your chit stamped.... It does not make for much fun though when you want to leave and have to queue for 40 mins to get out whilst everyone pays for their covercharge and drinks!! so weird!! If you lose your ticket you have to pay $200 reals (brazillian currency, about hmm 130 dollars i guess!) no good at all as one of our group found out after leaving it in the bathroom. Luckily a brazillian friend did some fast talking for her, but it definitely made us laugh as we thought about how many drunk people managed to actually hold onto their ticket all night!!

 

A few hours later it was time for ... i know you have heard this before, but the most amazing breakfast buffet I have ever seen! tables and tables of everything you could think of, fruit, cereal, brown breads... and wait for it... real yoghurt and sugarless cereals!! woohoo! the first time I have seen thiese since leaving home!! Of course there was cheese and ham and dulce de leche,but hey!

 

We then began our favela tour, which is the poor areas of the city. www.bealocal.com was the tour company and they were so fantastic! We got dropped off at the bottom of a hill and were dispatched off on motorbikes through the small windy streets to the top. It was a huge surprise we weren`t expecting...even wearing a short skirt! But it was one of the most amazing experiences of the trip! We weaved through tiny spaces as our shoulders brushed against cars and buses as we arrived at the favela entrance to be astounded by the powerlines. Hundreds of wires were going everywhere! I don`t think I can even begin to describe what an OH&amp;S nightmare it was...and I am not even an electrician!! The people in the favela`s cant afford to pay electricity so they just tap into the wires with wires of their own to their houses and get free electricity... and cable tv...and internet! We passed an ambulance treating a head injury as we were told to put our cameras away and not take any photo`s of anyone with a gun or walki talki as these people were working for the drug lords. We passed several as we walked through the tiny streets where if you see land and start building on it, it is yours! People then sell the roof of their houses to others to build, creating a crazy nightmare!

 

We visited an art studio where people from the favela paint in order to generate an income. I brought a small painting here as it was such an interesting tour and i was so taken by the place. The paintings were really cool, depicting life in Rio as a part of the favela. The `streets` were no more than half to a metre wide winding their way up and down around the shanty houses. The people were all so happy and friendly though as a wwhole even though we were essentially taking photo`s of their lives. We listened to a group of guys playing music on a rooftop with a view of the whole favela and then a group of kids playing ramba music on the street just using old tins, plastic buckets and essentially ruibbish! The streets also doubled as the drainage system and grey water, something that smelt like sewerage, overflow and rubbish all just ran by our feet as we walked. On the way out we saw written on the wall ................. which means `line of death` in Portugese where when the gangs clash that is the point where the gang from the favela meets the rival gang as they try and enter and people are killed and then just buried somewhere in the favela. A few of us jumped in a cab and headed down to one of the main attractions... Copacabana beach!!! The first view definitely did not disappoint as we were mesmerized by the beautiful beach, surrounded by the beautiful countryside and of course all the beautiful brazillians wearing not much at all!! I have never seen so many pairs of speedo`s or tiny bikinis worn as regular clothes just down the street! One way of the street was closed to traffic as hundreds and hundreds of locals and tourists alike walked, rode, ran, skated their way down the beach enjoying the sunshine and scenery. There were people relaxing, swimming, playing volleyball, sitting at cafe`s, buying from the street stalls and just the most amazing atmosphere! After about maybe 4 km of beach there is some shops before hitting ipenema and watching the colours of the sunset, white sand and palm trees drinking fresh coconut milk out of a coconut....ahhh so unbelieveably awesome!! this is definitely the life!!! A friend from the tour had been mugged on the beach at night so as the darkness set i headed towards civilisation only to stumble across an open travel agent at 6pm on a sunday night!!! I had been looking for one all day as I needed to book a flight to Buenos Aires the following day and could not do it online!!! Nice! Saved me sitting at the airport for a few hours the next day trying! I found some cool markets and wandered around the streets enjoying the summer holiday atmosphere before meeting the rest of the tucan tour gang at Copacabana for dinner. Unfortunately it was time to say goodbye to half which was sad as we had all gotten along so well!! The next morning was goodbye to the rest as I then headed for haviana world at Copacabana beach.... a whoooooooooooole shop full of every single type of haiviana you can imagine!!! (Hav`s are the worlds most comfortable thongs and originate from Brazil!) Every single person wears them in Rio too!!! Soooo awesome!!! Unfortunately next the ATM decided to grab my money before I could and suck it back in and I spent the next inordinate amount of time on the phone trying too get it sorted with a portuguese chick who had no idea what i meant!!! ahhh!! So frustrating!!! The money definitely out of my account, it is still a work in progress trying to get that back!!  Between that and finding a cool shop with backpacker t shirts I was running a tad late trying to get to the airport for my flight with no money to pay the cabbie and no portuguese to explain. I couldnt get my back up aussie cards to work either but luckily the cabbie managed to work it out and take me to a ,multi bank stop and then get someone to fix it!!phew!!! Almost an hour behind schedule I arrived at the airport and made it just as they closed the flight check in! Buenos Aires here i come!

 

 

 

 
Buenos Aires... the city that never sleeps

2008-05-20 to 2008-05-26


 
Arriving to meet Courtney, a girl from Peru`s Challenge (who co-oincidently lives in Cronulla!) who I was to spend the next week travelling with in a steaming hot Buenos Aires night but then the worlds coldest day the next as we walked through full of lovely old buildings, a fantastic atmosphere, lots of dogwalkers...and logs of dog poo everywhere! Downtown was beautiful and we took a tour of the impressive congress building before finding our way to Recoleta Cemetery. The cemetery was impressive, like its own little city with marked streets and street signs too among the gorgeous statues and tombs. We followed the hordes to the grave of Eva Peron in the Duarte family tomb. It was nice, but so plain to what we were expecting! Moving to San Telmo Tango City and beginning our time as real Argentineans we had a siesta in our strange room that had no ladder for the double bunk beds. It certainly made getting in and out not a little more interesting! Before meeting some other travellers in the hostel bar and checked out a local Irish... Argentinan Irish! pub. Wednesday saw us heading out to the new area of BA on the rio de la Plata, Puerto Madero until the most unbelieveable amount of rain came crashing down on our heads and we sought shelter in the Galleria Pacifico, an absolutely beautiful shopping center... unfortunately nothing a backpacker could afford there though! We exited straight onto Avenida Florida, a huge pedestrian mall full of excellent (and affordable!) shops and also found people just tangoing to beautiful music in the street! Ahh Buenos Aires! We had been given a hot tip to head to the Museum nightclub for the evening which turned out to only be about 3blocks from our hotel...handy! Arriving at about 10pm we felt strange as nothing in BA usually starts until 2am at the earliest...unlike back home when things start winding up! But it was an after work crowd at the club and although we were the only foreigners there (and really standing out with our blonde hair amongst the 2000 other darker locals!) it was great seeing the real Argentina so i to speak i guess! We also met a couple of new local friends which was really awesome as well. Thursday on our way downtown to Plaza de Mayo we came across a demonstration for (as far as we could tell) workers rights which shut down the streets and apparently happens about every week,which really annoys the locals who are trying to actually work instead of protest about it. They had massive flags, drums, music, firecrackers, it was quite a spectacle though! All around the plaza was filled with really impressive old buildings, a massive bank, the Casa Rosada (pink house.... and it is really totally all very pink) where Eva Peron made her famous speech from the balcony was gorgeous and housed a little museum inside. And a great cathedral where Jose San Martin–the man who liberated Argentina (... and in case that wasnt enough, then went on to also liberate Chile and Ecuador!) has his very impressive tomb. Catching a bus to La Boca, where Argentina`s most famous soccer team, Boca Juniors (blue and yellow) hail from we came across a beautiful little place on the river full of coloured buildings, live music and lots of cobbled pedestrian streets with outdoor cafes. So gorgeous! We then caught up with a friend we had met at the museum, Gonz, his friend Juan and another backpacker Alex to head out to a parilla for dinner. Parillas probably best translates as a steakhouse and they are on every corner!!! Argentina is famous for its meat,but what we didnt realise is that they actually eat the entire cow!Literally, not wasting a single bit. The locals ordered for us and we feasted on BBQ blood sausage and intestines which after almost vomiting after one bite I waited for the real meat!... which was absolutely delicious. The rest I will never eat again however! Maybe hard to believe, but worse than guinea pig! Moving to the Borges hostel in Palmero after our first choice did not receive our booking we wandered aimlessly around Palermo before heading to the Evita Museum which was inside a beautiful old building that Eva and her husband had set up to help mainly single mothers. It was really interesting as well to find out not all Argentineans actually loved the Peron`s, but only the working classes due to the way that they ran the country. Very interesting. As locals we siesta-ed before finding the cutest little local eatery with some lovely Argentinean grandpa`s working there before meeting another friend from the museum, Franko and Juan (every other person in this city is called Juan!!!!) for some drinks before visiting Puerto Madero Asia club. Again a new hostel, the Tango backpackers... but only about 2 mins walk! And which turned out to be the best hostel so far. Walking through Palmero we found a cool little plaza, Plaza Serrano full of markets and outdoor cafes and wandered around the streets up to Av Cordoba which is full of discount shops....stay tuned for a new jumper in my photos now!woohoo! I am not sure the poor want my last one, but they have it anyway!! After our awesome little local dinner yesterday, we headed back again,much to the delight of the grandpa waiter before hanging out at the hostel bar where we met lots of new travelers and joined the hostel transfer to Crobar where we managed to keep Courtney up long enough to catch her crack of dawn flight back to Cuzco which worked out really well actually! With so many options for Sun I decided to get on some buses and hit the markets whilst seeing the various areas of town, starting out in Recoleta markets all through a massive park at Plaza Francia. They were full of lots of awesome things with a fantastic atmosphere and the kind of place that just made you really happy to be there! Next was onto San Telmo which was packed!!! There was live music on different corners and tango dancers. There also ate the most amazing pumpkin and corn thing...kind of like a calzone off a street vendor...amazing!! Next stop La Boca, as our previous visit had been almost in the dark. It was amazing! One of my favourite areas of BA. definitely very touristy with the souvenir shops and markets, but live bands, tango dancers on the streets, full outdoor cafes,friendly people, the gorgeous coloured buildings and the most amazing atmosphere!!! I was just walking around smiling i must have looked so odd! But then again, most the other people were too! Back to San Telmo to watch the locals all tangoing in the ........ plaza with crowds just listening to the beautiful music and dancing!!! sooo cool! Just when the day couldnt get any better,I managed to meet Toby and Ash from Peru`s Challenge for a drink before heading out with my local friend Franko! What a fantastic day! Sooo difficult to get up on Mon morn though at half past 7 for my flight....I dont think anyone in BA has ever been up that early... ever!!! So much to see and do and experience in BA that we certainly didnt get much sleep during the week, but Buenos Aires really is a 24 hour city! It has an amazing atmosphere and so much to see and do,a week just so doesnt give it justice! And once you get into the siesta and noctural lifestyle it is hard to change back!!! The city can also dubiously boast the world`s longest road,the biggest intersection ( Av9 de Julio)...not much fun to cross, or drive I would imagine! and the world`s largest river (River de la Plata) but so much more going for it!! Before I arrived in BA, I was tossing up my favourite/most interesting places thus far in south america and it is so difficult! But people have asked and I think i have narrowed it down... although it seems to change with what is newest in my mind!!!It is certainly strengthening my resolve to come back and work here that is for sure. I also love the spanish language,although I have lost a bit in the last few weeks, especially in Brazil with the Portugese and not having to use it when travelling with other people, I want to get better at it!! But here.... i think I have narrowed it down... In no particular order.... l Sunset on Ipenema Beach, Rio de Janeiro, Brazill The favelas, Rio de Janiero, Brazill Sugarloaf Mountain, Rio De Janeiro, BrazilMusic... tango... atmosphere... colours, La Boca, Buenos Aires, Argentina Parque Nacional Iguassu, Iguassu Falls, Argentina Tucan Bird Park, Foz Do Iguassu, Brazil l Camino Inka (the Inca trail) to Machu Picchu, Perul Inca ruins at the Sacred Valley, Cuzco, Perul Uros, the floating reed island, Lake Titicaca, Perul The most idealic place in the world, Colonia, Uruguayl Cerro la campana, Santiago, Chilel Watching live soccer, Cuzco, Peru,,, but anywhere in SA is awesome!! Food wise I would have to say Brazil, so much fruit everywhere, variety,variety, variety! and all fresh food with fresh tastes where ever you go.... even sushi!!! mmmmm Spanish school, volunteering and my tour were all just so super fantastic, but i cant put them as a whole or i would never get a finished list!!     Luckily (...?!) I had about a 12 hour journey to get to Mexico city for my next adventures where I will be couch surfing with a local girl named Elsa! ( www.couchsurfing.com ) !
 
Couchsurfing in Mexico, my 15 seconds of fame and some answers...! updated!

2008-05-26 to 2008-06-03


Couch surfing website is www.couchsurfing.com and it is `a worldwide network for making connections between travelers and the local communities they visit.` Basically it is a network of people who volunteer to have a traveller stay on their couch and then when you return home you return the favour for another traveller. So yes... meeting a total stranger online and then going to stay at their house in a foreign country!!!! 

 

 Sooo... I arrived outside my surfing hosts home in Naucalpan, Mexico about midnight and met a fantastic chick named Elsa and two of her friends. Her house she shared with her sisters was huge and had an awesome rooftop terrace from where you could see for miles... i even had a bed, not the couch so that was a nice surprise too! 

 

The next morning Elsa began uni for the summer semester so we headed out the door about 6am to see her uni before heading into centro where Elsa took me on a guided tour through town. We saw the gorgeous huge square and the remains of a pyramid right next to it. A little mudmodel also showed where the other pyramids were, buried under the city still!

 

We went past an old lolly shop from the 1800`s selling traditional Mexican lollies which were really fun to try... you would have loved it Bern! And there were lots of gluten free too as it was just sugar, sugar and sugar!! I took a photo for you!:+)

 

Mexico City has i think the largest amount of museums in the world!! There are literally hundreds! Elsa had advised the best one was the Museum of Anthropology so I decided to check it out. And it was brilliant... even for a not really museumy type person! It had so many artifacts and interesting exhibitions about all the different cultures that it would probably take a few days to see and read it all.

 

I was picked up by Elsa and her friend Riccardo... who happens to be a Mexican Army Civil Engineer Captain... so they took me in and gave me a tour of one of the bases in Mexico City which was really cool!

 

Arriving home, some other friends and travellers had dropped by so we began preparing dinner with a couple of Mexicans (Elsa, Aturro), Germans (Tobi and Hans),an American (Nick) and later another few Mexicans (Liz and Chucho) and a dutchman, Dan! We had so much fun everyone just running around making stuff and ended up with a really strange meal with influence from everyone! We even ate Cactus, which tasted just like salty beans!! The German guys helped me make a pav for dessert... but we couldnt find some of the exact ingredients at the supermarket (no whipping cream, white sugar... greaseproof paper... cream of tartar... fresh fruit....yes...hmmm.... just the basics!!!!!) and so it ended up looking not quite right.... at all! It also stuck sooooo badly to the baking paper and tray i had to break it into chucks to try and scrape it off and then attempt to reassemble!! attempt! But everyone was quite impressed with it, even though they had never seen or heard of it before!

 

One of the guys knew the Men at work song `land downunder` and asked what vegemite was that the song sings about... so I cracked it out (gracias senora barrett for sending it!!!!) Hmmm we got some interesting reactions that is for sure!!!! Only one person managed to actually enjoy it and eat their 1/6 of a piece of bread without gagging!!

 

After another late night and Liz and Aturro drove me into town on their way to work... but mexico city traffic thwarted our attempt, taking well over 2 hours by the time I arrived (it usually takes less than 1)... and definitely missing the bus I was supposed to catch to the pyramids!! Instead I caught one of those red double decker tourist buses that you see in all cities! I had never actually been on one before so it was quite fun cruising around the city, seeing all the sights and listening to the commentary, even if it was soooooo hot that the seat burnt through your pants! ow!!

I rang Elsa, who was already home so I braved the metro and collectivo to return home. It was crazy arriving at the end of the metro line, having to take an exit from a-z, depending on your final location and then having to jump onto a bus or little collectivo van from the hundreds that zoomed past in a crazy chaotic way. I jumped on the right one... but someone missed the stop and managed to end up at the end of the line in a Mexican favela... definitely not the best place to be that is for sure!!!!! I managed to make the driver understand where I needed to go and jumped back into a collectivo for a return trip.... almost 3 hours after I left town, tired, grumpy, thirsty and in desperate need of the toilet I arrived home to a freaked out Elsa wondering what on earth had happened to me and what on earth she was going to do!!!

 

An icecream from the local parlor soothed our nerves as Elsa`s friend Chucho arrived and we walked down the road to the local taco shop for dinner. The owner was really cool and had known Elsa and Chucho for ages as she had lived there so long and always had used the store as their `local`. I still cant get over how different mexican food is to home!!! We were given onions to start and then I had a back/shoulder taco (hmm so fatty) and then a pork and pineapple taco! This is the most traditional!! ...And i had never heard of it before! We also had so many types of chilli to choose from all lined up freshly made on the table. So good!

 

It was take 2 for the pyramids on thu as Liz again gave me a lift, but this time we managed to avoid the traffic and I made it onto my bus for the pyramid visit. We visited Tlatelolco ruins in the city and also the sight of the big massacre of student protesters just before the Mexico Olympics that was the story of the movie Red Dawn. We also learnt the story of´Montezuma´s Revenge´which I had never known before about how when the spanairds a noble called Montezuma was really good to them, but they then killed him... afterwards they all became sick and such as Montezuma´s revenge... andso it continues to this day when you eat bad food you getM ontezumas Revenge!

 

We then moved onto La Basilica de Guadalupe which has a story of man seeing the apparition of the virgin of guadalupe, asking her for help for the town, but then no one believed him. When he asked for proof to show the people, the virgin gave him a bunch of roses (as it was winter and they were not growing). He put them in his cape and when he displayed them to the people, a full image of the virgin had appeared on his cape. This actual cape is on display in the church too. The image is very famous and is more common in households than that of Jesus or Mary. The church is massive too.. there was an original church there, but it is sinking into the ground and on a crazy angle! As a result a new one was built next to it to try and house the thousands of people that flock to the church.

 

At the rear was a hill that overlooked the city and with beautiful gardens and grounds which was so nice to wander around.

Heading out of town we arrived at the Martine family (tourist!) house where we learnt about this cool mexican tree that makes paper, needle and thread and also an alcoholic drink! So usefull! We saw all the local volcanic stones and all the ican and teotihuacan gods carved out of them before listening to the mariachis as we ate a typical mexican feast with deep fried tacos. so weird!

 

Another quick ruins before we arrived at Teotihuacan, the city built by Teotihucan who then abandonded it and it was found by the incas severalhundred years later. There are so many pyramids there that archeaologists have been working foir 100 years and there are still so many mounds you can see which have temples buried under the vegetation. Pretty cool. We walked down the road of death ( so called as it was the last thing the sacrifices saw!) and climbed the temples of the sun and the moon.... the steps were soooooo steep!!! There was also a tiny little piece of silver on the top of the temple of the sun which was supposed to signify the middle of the temple and give you energy if you touched it!

The guide then had the alcohol from themiddle of the tree from earlier for us to try...gross! like flat beer! And an almond tequilla made and sold only in teotihuacan - so delicious! like sugared almonds!

That evening was the weekly get together of the Mexico City Couch surfing chapter so Elsa,Riccardo and I headed in to meet up with so many awesome people! It was so much fun!

 

Fri morn I heard this strange bell noise outside and suddenly heard Elsa and her sister Julie yelling! It was the garbage truck! It goes down the street, rings a bell allowing you time to run and get your garbage and then wait in the street for the truck to return, personally give him your garbage, pay him and then continue on with you day!! such a strange system!!!

 

Elsa and I then headed into town for breakfast at Azulejos, the house of blue tiles (literally covered in blue mosaics!) that has such a long and amazing history, originally built by a son whose dad told him he would never amount to anything just to prove his dad wrong! It survived the revolution, with photos of people using it during that era,had anassination on the stairs and all kinds of other interesting things!

 

I was going to only stay in Mexico city for a few days, and then travel around, but there was so much to see and do, I had a great host and heaps of cool people to hang out with, that I just decided to stay at Elsa`s the whole time instead! Another strange circumstance is that Elsa`s dad is also a General in the Mexican Army and is commander of the forces out at Tuxpan, in the state of Veracruz, on the north coast of Mexico. Elsa Invited me to visit for the weekend with her family and so on Fri afternoon we jumped on the bus together with Elsa`s abuelito`s (grandparents) to Tuxpan! Due to traffic we got there a bit late and there weren`t enough seats so I ended up on a separate bus... luckily for us there were 2 going at the exact same time!!

 

The trip was about 6hours and we arrived about half past 11pm to the heat still!!!! and to be picked up by Elsa`s dad 9 in a huge black hummer. We drove for about 2 mins and arrived at the base where the house was! A soldier then quickly ran down to open and then close the gate for us... something they proceeded to do each time we arrived or left... why they didn`t just install an electric gate was beyond me!

 

The house overlooked the river as well so it was just awesome! It is a really small town, more a beachside holiday place I think, but really nice. Elsa, her sister Mariana and I then met some of Elsa`s friends to sample the local nightlife... i don`t think that many foreign tourists make it to Tuxpan either because everyone kept looking at my pasty white skin and hair!!!

 

Sat up nice and early... again! to head to the base to view the exhibition of all the art and craft works that had been made by all the officers wives in a group that Elsa`s mum had formed. All the base heirachy came down to see it and there was a lot of things, from paintings, to toilet seat covers, aprons, sewing, marshmallow decorations and these really cool animals made out of fruit! We then had morning tea and there began my weekend of eating mini food...! (or canape`s for those who prefer!)

 

Quickly changing, Elsa`s dad had arranged for us to go out on their workspeed boat along the river. We were picked up and driven to the base to jump in and cruise around! So beautiful! We then stopped at the dock as a few uniformed people ran down to to give us the lunches they had made us. We then all took turns driving the speedboat along the river! so much fun!!!! Before stopping to have lunch in the grounds of this house house right on the river what belonged to a friend of Elsa`s dad. We had fresh lychees and a strange yellow melony/mango thing (sapato y domingo) that the guys picked off the trees for us and tucked into sandwiches and an esky full of drinks. It was so unbelievably awesome!

 

All the mini food and strange fruit creatures had mysteriously turned up at the house so we were able to re-feast on mini food before then heading to the beach where we had a table and chairs in a little thatched hut on the sand, sat in a hammock and drank coconut water from the fresh coconuts they were selling in little carts along the beach! It was really weird though as the cars all drive onto the beach, and they even have public transport buses driving along the sand picking and dropping off people!!! so weird!! Tuxpan is known for its sunsets so we all sat there on the beautiful beach and watched a beautiful sunset. Such a perfect day!!!!!

 

We decided to head into town for dinner and ended up at a karaoke bar/restaurant type thing. I am not quite sure how, but Mariana and I ended up singing the first song of the night to the entire bar.... `I will survive` ...in English thank goodness!!!Although for those that have had the privilege of hearing me sing, Spanish might have actually helped! And we got cut off by the administrators too!!! Very funny that is for sure though!

 

Another early rise on Sunday as it was Mexican Navy day!!! The whole family was picked up and driven to the Navy base as we sat in the VIP seats and watched the ceremony!! The Navy drill is really different too... very high leg kicks with each step! It was a good ceremony to watch though and we were right behind where the speeches were being made so we are fairly confident we ended up on the news as well with all the cameras on us!

 

We then we grabbed and rushed down to the wharf to get onto the VIP boat where many many photos were taken of the VIPs, Elsa`s dad and family.... and me! I have to wonder what they thought of this strange random Australian couch surfer in all their photo`s and footage, but everyone was all so welcoming and friendly and involved me in everything! I have no idea who they thought i was!! It was so much fun though! When all the different boats were full, we began sailing down the river ... drinking cold drinks, admiring the view and eating more mini food! We held a wreath laying ceremony off the back of the boat once we left the river and arrived in the ocean for all those who had lost their lives in the line of duty and then the boats all proceeded to have a water fight amongst themselves using their water cannons!

 

Sailing back we were then escorted down the road to another VIP function with some more mini food! I met a lot of people that day and as is the custom to kiss as a greeting... I have no idea who many of the people were (apart from those with the fairly obvious heavy,glowing rank slides!!!) , (or maybe more to the point who they thought i was!) but with Elsa and her family I sure kissed a lot of strange people that day!!

 

Formalities over, we walked into town and met a new friend from the morning at this awesome little place that made the most delicious drinks by pureeing fruit in separate layers in a glass. soooooooo good!!! We saw some more tucans (woohoo!) at a restaurant (not sure why they were there...?!) and then headed home to have a karaoke party in the gazebo and redeem ourselves after the night before!!

 

So that was my 15 seconds of fame in Mexico! If only we could have hung around to see it! What a crazy great weekend! But all too soon it was time to catch the midnight bus back to Mexico City (awesome bedseats–the best I have been in so far!!!), arriving home, quickly changing and heading back out to take Elsa to Uni and me to town!! Sooooo tired, we both somehow made it through the day and met up to have a traditional mexican dinner in town. There are so many taco options!! I had fish, octopus and turkey!! Very good, but none of them come with any lettuce and tomato or anything like that like at home.... just straight meat! We were also served a plate of Chillis and carrots... assuming as per the carrots they were there to be eaten and after not finding the green peppers hot at the last meal I proceeded to eat one, even with the look of horror on Elsa`s face. Her look of horror soon turned to non stop laughter though as the most intense burning pain hit me and I could not stop crying for ages! It took a good few hours for my face to stop burning too!! I would like to say,when in Mexico... but ... valuable lesson learnt!!!!!

 

Not more than 3 or 4 hours of sleep every night in Mexico for Elsa and I and the same for me in Buenos Aires, as fantastic as my time there was and tempted as I was to change my flights to stay, I was looking forward to Miami to catch up on some rest and sleep!! And hopefully Elsa could then too!! Less than 2 hours after going to bed, I was up (and semi awake) and on my way to the airport.. For the first time in months, land of english, of being able to flush toilet paper and drink the water.... Miami here i come!

 

P.S. I know the concept might freak a few people out, but Couch Surfing was such an awesome opportunity to live life and experience life as a local... and so much fun!! Also it definitely helps not having to pay accommodation costs all the time too. I have already started arranging some couches to surf in Finland, Sweden and Norway later this year!

 

 

Thanks to everyone for the messages!!!! ...Grandma and mum.. a few answers for you and joy!! :)

Hi mum, Yep, got my card back... it was a cash passport so it wasnt too bad... still waiting for the money back though!!!!!!!!!!!! no one wants to take responsibility... fun fun fun!!

 

Dulce de Leche literally translates from the spanish as sweet milk and it is basically a toffee type caramel ( like the one you make with sweetened condensed milk) and it is EVERYWHERE here!!!! everywhere!!!! on everything and for every meal!

Caiparianaha... i think i spelt that wrong actually, but is it a brazillian cocktail made with a a pure alcohol called cachaca made from sugar cane! It is basically cachaca, lime, ice and tons of sugar!

OH&amp;S nightmare... back home Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) is a really big issue in the workplace and if something just looks really dangerous or you would never be able to make it safe enough to pass the safety audits, we call it an OH&amp;S nightmare! As it causes us nightmares!!!

Miami to Nicaragua

2008-06-07 to 2008-06-04


 

 I arrived to the jazz hostel on Miami beach, although the heat in Miami was actually much more than I had expected! Miami`s main attraction is the beach... and that is pretty much it! It is a massive wide stretch of sand which really does stretch as far as the eye can see though which is really quite cool. The beach, heaps and heaps of restaurants along the beach road and some shops is Miami! I thought it would have a lot more, but I was only staying at Miami beach, the little jutting out beach bit on the map! I explored the beach with the baywatch towers, the shops and the massive pedestrian mall, Lincoln Avenue. The hostel was a street away from everything so it was so convenient and nice and relaxing though and a nice change from running around doing a million zillion different things, as fun as they were! 

 

I know I have added like a zillion sunset pictures from this trip, but I love them and I just keep seeing really cool sunsets everywhere I go that are all just that little bit different! Sooo... I headed down to the beach to see the Miami beach sunset!! And it was beautiful too!

 

Wednesday, the next morning I was ready to face a hostel breakfast without dulce de leche and white bread...and it didn`t disappoint... waffles ... peanut butter and jelly! mmmm mm! So what I would think of as typical American...! But they wonder why they are facing an obesity epidemic!

 

I strolled around `town` again, through espanola way killing time before my flight. Arriving at Miami airport I checked in, checked my bags and then carried them to another area for the bag drop, watching in horror as some chick who couldn`t care less randomly threw them and piled them up inside and outside the barricade with bags literally everywhere!!!!! Luckily I then saw a sign for a military serviceman`s club... a kind of QANTAS club for serving military. Figuring I had nothing to lose I headed up and was admitted no problems at all by the lovely staff to kill time before my flight sitting on the comfy couch, watching tele, reading magazines and filling up on all the free food!(..hey....I am a budget backpacker now!) so that was definitely a nice surprise instead of having to join the hordes of other travelers waiting at the gate.

 

Flying the the crazy rain and storms to arrive in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, I headed to the information desk for a map and bus info as I had it on good advice from a fellow couch surfer that I was better off just getting as far away from Managua as I could as fast as I could! Pleasantly surprised to find American Airlines had not lost my bags I was unpleasantly surprised to be then hounded as all the locals had asked the tour information desk where I was going and they all wanted to `help` me. I had about 5 people following me around, trying to convince me to use their service, catch their taxi to Grenada (hmmm tough choice... US$45 vs US$1 for the bus!!!!), stay at their place or who knows what else. I was going insane as they kept talking to me, following me and not leaving me alone! Even standing behind me at the ATM! They wouldn`t listen and I finally just cracked it at them... even in my dodgy spanish i think they got the picture!!! finally!!!!!!!! Geez, I know I really stand out in south america and I guess because of that iam an `easy` target... but really!!! surely those tactics dont work??!! Unless people just get sick of them and go with them anyway just to get rid of them?! i have no idea. I finally got a cab and headed to the bus station... so i thought... until the driver informed me he was taking me to Grenada! Far out! So annoying!! It was about half past 7 at this stage, I was so tired and over it and after all the messing about at the airport thought I was even going to miss the last bus so I was not a happy camper! We had words (he first pretended not to understand me the rude bugger!!!) and he then wisely decided to take me to the bus terminal like I requested and we had agreed on a price for. Crazy. We finally arrived about 10 mins before the last `buses` left for the evening. Although `bus` is a very loose term as I saw a random patch of concrete jammed with the micro-vans or collectivo`s... the mikrolet vans that squish in as many locals as possible. I had no time to think as the taxi stopped and a whole bunch of other random people from different `buses` ran to the car and started grabbing my things and running in opposite directions toward their own little buses. Somehow I managed to get them all, get my stuff and get on probably the last bus for the night to Grenada!

 

As we drove the 45 mins the storm continued and the most amazing monsoonal rain just poured down constantly. I was dreading finding my stop and walking the several blocks to my hostel, but somehow, for some reason, the driver and door dude decided that as I was the last one on the bus and it was raining they would drop me directly off at my hostel which was really nice... even if i did not understand what on earth they said!

The Bearded Monkey had the biggest dorm rooms I have ever seen, with massive massive bunks made for giants! In fact, the top bunk was well over 6 foot in the air... which definitely made getting in and out quite a challenge! It was(kind of!) funny too watching some of the guys forget they were in these massive high altitude sickness bunks and go to jump off the side and go crashing to the floor at a rate of knots. Luckily no one was seriously injured... when I was there at least!

 

My Nicaraguan couch surfing friend, Luis had told me about Laguna de Apoyo, the massive crater lake in the jungle that was just a little slice of heaven! The hostel had a tour on the next day so I joined my fellow travelers to visit `The Monkey Hut`, a little property on the edge of the lagoon. The first view definitely was a view of a little piece of heaven with the massive, massive lake, beautiful scenery, jungle, trees, hammocks, and a cozy little guesthouse to spend the day in. We also had massive rubber tyres to float in the lake on (yes.... for those that were there, just like Nov on Hamiliton Island for your wedding Bern and Jas!!), kayaks and everything! So sooooooooooooo good! There was also a massive volcano, Mombacho behind the lake and I decided to hike up Mt Catarina to see the view from the top. With dodgy directions such as `you will see a path on your left` I somehow made it onto what I thought was the path... but halfway up the hill it started going across and down so I decided to head upwards,bush bashing through the jungle and hoping i didnt come across any of those awful howler monkeys i could hear screaming all around me! Yes... it did cross my mind that no one would ever find me again as I did not pass an entire person on the `track` and it was about a zillion degrees with even higher humidity...but alls well that ends well hey! Arriving at a break in the jungle I walked toward a little hut and found on the other side a whole little congregation of shops ,music and restaurants! It was definitely the last thing I expected and so bizarre after being in the middle of nowhere and not seeing a single soul the entire way!

 

The view was gorgeous though with the green green jungle, massive blue lake, giant volcano and gorgeous sky so definitely worth the couple of hot hours to get up there! Luckily I managed to find my same path back (...not exactly sure how!!) to spend the rest of the day relaxing in the rubber tubes in the lagoon.... ahhhhhhhhhh!

 

A fellow traveler from the UK, Matt and I decided to check out the gorgeous little colonial town of Grenada the following morning. It has quite an interesting history after being founded in 1524 and undergoing the same conquests as the rest of the area before being attacked and power seized by a US adventurer William Walker. He reinstated slavery, mortgaged the country and declared new laws amongst other things! The nation tried to drive him out, but he fled and burned down the entire city behind him in 1856!

 

A lot of the original buildings are still there, but have never been properly restored, so it is very interesting to look at, knowing the history. We walked through the centre of town (it is tiny! Maybe 6 blocks!) and down to Lago de Nicaragua (Nicaragua Lake) which unfortunately is really polluted, grey and stinks! It had so much rubbish around the edge and heaps of thongs... like a mass backpacker drowning or something!! We arrived at Centro Turistico, or the tourist centre with a grand entrance, covered in flags and paid our 5 cordobas toenter ( ...about 25cents). After beginning the 4km round trip we quickly realised this was not the tourist centre that the lonely planet proclaimed as we did not see another soul the entire time... except for those keen locals trying to see us a boat tour!! It was a bit creepy actually, like a deserted ghost town full of massive restaurants and parks and childrens playgrounds all just eireely empty! We beat a hasty retreat (well as hasty as you can with 4km, in thongs, pounding sun and about 100% humidity!) and headed around the sights in town, the parque central (main square), the cathedral, San Francisco and La Merced Churches before arriving at the La Polvera Fort for a view over the city which was pretty cool, apart from seeing all the rubbish and squallor the poorer people were living in. Into thecrazy markets before heading back to the hostel and the monsoonal rain arrived! I was trapped!!!!! I managed to hail a cab after it refused to cease after half an hour and psyshed myself up for grabbing my bags and making my way down to the `bus station` to catch the `bus` back to Managua like an old hand!!

In Managua I met my Nicarauan couch surfing buddy Luis for dinner and he took meon a tour of the city... which definately reinforced the right decision to head straight to Granada!

The next morning there was just time to head out to Huellas de Acahualinca, which has 12 sets of human footprints from 6000-7000 years ago discovered under 4m of volcanic materiel by quarry workers in 1874. They are really well preserved and some of the oldest footprints in the world so that was very interesting to see. Not so interesting was the dodgy neighbourhood it was in as I was locked inside a wire to protect me as i waited for a taxi out - the only safe way to travel there! I quickly moved on to Loma de Tiscapa, the hill overlooking the city with a huge silhouette of Sandino (the leader of a rebel campaign resisting US involvement in the country), the huge tiscarpa crater lake and also the site of a previous Presidentialpalace (now gone!) and Sandino`s execution!

Luis kindly picked me up from the hostel for a crazy Nicaraguan traffic trip to the airport to jump onto my first American Airlines flight to Miami where I spent almost 2 hours lining up trying to get through! It was a mad rush to find my bags... which had by then been moved from the carousel, have them inspected and then line up again to have them re-checked for my LA leg! It was touch and go, but (no thanks to theless than friendly or helpful staff!!!) I made the next flight! Unfortunately it was full of turbulance and we arrived late and tired... ready for the next epic with the bags!!! fun fun fun!

 

P.S. Not trying to jinx myself from now on either... but I have made it through the entirely of my south and central america trip without being mugged!!!! I am not exactly sure how but am definately happy about it!!! I figure I must look like such a bum backpacker by now they figure I have nothing of value anyway!! ... and... they would be right! k xxx

 
LA Orientation to Stone Mountain Adventures, Pennsylvania - Summer Camp USA! UPDATED!

2008-06-07 to 2008-06-21


After another extremely painful American Airlines flight(...i am starting to see a pattern here!!!!) I arrived late into LA and then stood around for hours (literally!) whilst we waited for our luggage to arrive. I then stood and waited whilst 4 supershuttles drove past without picking me before finally arriving at the hotel about 2am well and truly ready for bed... and not just any bed, but my first real bed, room and bathroom to myself in forever!! It was exciting even through my haze of well overtiredness!

I wandered around the local area the next morning (as I had to wake up early and check out!!!) and was disappointed by the tiny westfield... I thought Americans were supposed to have massive shopping malls! Give me Westfield Miranda Fair any day! It was time to recheck in with CCUSA (Camp Counsellors USA) and meet my new roomies Steph and Lauren. We all attended orientation training and heard about 2 girls that were mugged at gunpoint 500m away on the wayto the westfield 2 days ago.... right where I was a few hours earlier...nice!

We met a few more counsellors from all different camps and headed out to dinner together before chatting with some more guys and crashing early.

The next morning again bright and early was our first American breakfast here... donuts, pastries, muffins... the entire contents of a bakery minus the bread!I had never seen so much sugar in one place before! So gross!

I met up with a few more counsellors and Rob, Rueben, Vanessa, Tegan, Tenille, Ben and I headed down to Venice Beach to see Muscle Beach and be entirely astounded at the concrete jungle the beach was! Between that and the smog it was the greyest place ever! We saw the Baywatch lifeguard towers and watched the locals rollerblading and biking down the promenade though just like in the movies before grabbing a volleyball and playing beach volleyball on Santa Monica Beach! Great fun!

We tried out the crazy fitness exersites on the way to Santa Monica Pier, (the one with the amusement park on it!) before heading down to the Boulevard to test out some traditional American cuisine... burgers! We escaped the sun playing pool (i`m not sure how but I won 2 out of 3 games?!??!) before heading back to hang out and say some goodbyes. We had all crashed in one room to reduce our costs so it was a very late night before I tiptoed out at half past 3 in the morning to begin my next American Airlines flight!

Sorry to anyone who works at Flight Centre, but the useless one (Southgate!!!!) I went through to book my tickets lost me my direct flight so I had to change planes in Dallas on the way to New York... after 2 hours at the airport, we then unfortunately lost power on the tarmac and spent the next 2 hours sitting in the oven of the plane without aircon on the hot hot tarmac whilst they tried to sort it out! Eventually they decided it was all good (I would have prefered a new plane!!!!!!!!!) and we were on our way.

After some hassles finding a hostel, I ended up with a great one on central park and also enjoyed taking the shared shuttle there so I could get a city tour for free as we dropped off all the other people at hotels around the city!

 

New York is my favourite American city to far! It has a great atmosphere and vibe and everyone is actually really friendly! It is also really safe! So it kind of shattered all the myths I had in my mind about it!! I walked up to Broadway and found this awesome health food store you will have to travel over here to visit Bern! It is MASSIVE and practically everything is gluten free! Very exciting! By the time I came out the summer afternoon storm had arrived after the hot hot day and it was blowing a gale! Tree branches fell down around me and rubbish and dirt slapped me as I quickly made my way home!

Wed morn i headed down to the subway to head to the train station. The amtrak trains are so comfy, the 6 hours from New York to Huntingdon, Pennsylvania flew by...apart from the fact that the aircon temperature was entirely arctic! Iarrived at the tiny tiny tiny!! station and was met by Crista, the assistant director for my summer camp! www.sma-summers.com is the website, Stone Mountain Adventures, Pennsylvania. We drove about half an hour and arrived at the Millar farm where summer camp is held. The camp actually just takes over their property each summer!!

I settled into my bunk in the converted tack room and ex chicken coup that is staff quarters, about a metre away from the barn yard full of horses as i discovered walking out the back door! It is a cool little set up where the counselors all live together for the summer and have a seperate common room as well as the `bedroom` where the bunks are which is pretty cool. I met some of the other early arrivals of counselors, the entire Millar family (Jud, Anne and 2 yr old Wyatt) as well as Jud`s parents Biff and Pam who founded Stone Mountain and live across the road! and found an absolutely amazing bunch of people. It was so interesting as well to see the farm set up as a house as we started to move things and by the end of the week the entire household contents had been relocated and it was suddenly a dining hall ready for the kids!

 

Thu was my welcome to working in America as we all got up early and headed off on about a 3 anda half hour drive into ..... to pick up the vans that we would be driving the kids around in for the summer. The vans are huge! About 15 seaters and somehow they all had to get home to the farm... and so the Pommies and I had a `crash` course in driving back to front on the opposite side of the road and took a van each to begin! It was crazy!!! Luckily most of it was highway driving so i didnt have to worry about wihch way to look at intersections, but just had to try and stay on the road and not veer too far to the right which i wanted to do the whole time!! The entire convoy made it back in one piece and lots of laughs which was fun. We also learnt the funniest game `polebarn` which we all stopped and played at beautiful Greenwood furnace lake before jumping in for a dip....brrrr!!!

 

By then most of the other counselors had arrived and we had a great time meeting each other and heading into town (about 2 streets!!!!) to listen to our director Jud`s bluegrass band play a gig. We then had a slideshow on camp and all started getting excited that we were finally here and ready to begin!

 

Fri, the 13 Jun officially began staff orientation with meetings in the 200 year old barn and lots of fun silly games to get to know each other. The afternoon began our `van safety` classes which made me laugh after all the overseas staff had just driven them for several hours the day before! We drove around town with Biff and found a fantastic icecream parlour! It was so much harder with the van full and all the intersections and directions to figure out in every which way!

Frisbee Golf is a big part of camp life here and we headed down to the camp frisbee golf course to begin our 9 holes! The rain began and it was so much fun trying to throw through the trees and find the frisbee in the jungle undergrowth after each throw! Such a fun game though! We had our first `camp` dinner and realised how well we were going to be eating this summer!!! before campfire time! We told stories and had songs and smores before finishing our first full camp day. Already all 14 staff from across America, the UK and me! feel so much at home and already like friends. This place is awesome!!!

Sat morning saw us jumping into the freezing cold Greenwood Furnace lake for our swim test that we do with the campers before embarking on a game on ultimate frisbee... so much fun! The afternoon we headed out to pulpit rock for some climbing!! I can hardly believe we are getting paid to do this! It is seriously the most amazing job in the world!!

The fun was to continue in the evening with invention convention, an activity we do with the campers where they are given a box full of random things and they have to use all the things in the box and come up with a ad for an invention that will only cost three easy payments of $19.95! Lots of dressing up ensured from the `bunk junk` room which is full of the most amazing and crazy dress up clothes for everyone to wear whenever they like at any time or place!

 

Sun morn was the opportunity to spend some time on our specialist activities. My rockclimbing offsider, a american guy named Kelly and another counselor Justin headed out to Raystown cliffs to do some climbing! The sight was so gorgeous and we set up and rapelled and climbed overlooking an amazing valley. All too soon it was time to head back for lunch and conflict resolution activities. We also found a mulberry bush full of ripe mulberries whilst we waited for the doctor to arrive for the first aid lesson. All was going well until my feet started burning! I also was wondering why no one else was around the back of the trees... stinging nettles! My first experience with a painful american plant..ow! We also then learnt about poison ivy.... i am scared to go in the bush now!!! It was interesting to see that the technique is different for snake bites here too... definately no bandaging the limb (i checked!) either a tourniquet for some bites or nothing!!!!

Pam and Biff were holding a BBQ for all the SMA staff and neighbours which was nice to get to meet the people we would be seeing on the road and impacting on their lives for the next few months. Here I also really noticed the chip obsession that americans have! Packet chips are with every meal! not as a snack before, but as a side dish to the meal...and they all think it is normal! weird,

 

All day mon was specialist activities and so Kelly and I spent the morning sorting out the shack where all the gear was before Kelly taught me how to set up the anchors for the climbs. We then headed out for the afternoon with another counselor, Red Beard to try and find some new rocks to climb on. We couldnt locate them and stopped into a local store to ask for some directions. The lady provided some directions and off we went! Unfortunately the directions proved to be a little dubious and we ended up on a narrow road with a cliff on either side which we couldnt turn around on and so ended up driving forever!! We finally found a crossroad and luckily Red Beard recognised a landmark and made it out alive! We saw some cool wildlife and lots of good driving practice and laughs!!

 

 

The clouds were gathering as we all cumulated at the 1000 steps hike and began... but after about 700 stairs the heavens opened up and poured down hail on us!! Trying to run down the slippery steps and hide our heads from the hailing ice we made it back home for dinner and leadership!2

 

Tues morning we were dreading as we headed into State College (the capital) for CPR refresher training and boy was it painful!! Sooo long and never ending! But another interesting thing to note was that Americans still use the heimlich manoeuvre for choking as well and not under any circumstances backslaps!!! We had an opportunity to walkaround State College before heading back to the farm to begin set up for camp!

Texan Taysha and I drove into town to the laundramat and had a hilarious time forgetting stuff, driving in circles trying to get the fuel cards to work and all kinds of fun stuff!

After camp prep in the morn we jammed all our stuff into dry sacks and got into the bunk junk cabinet to find an outfit to float down the river with for our canoeing overnight! The rain came in as we were trying to get in and we got drenched sitting in canoes on the river before Justin and I tipped in!!! The first ones over in one of the rapids with the esky full of food too! It was so much fun! It got a little cold towards the end but luckily we arrived at our campsite and setup andmaking rock chairs around the fire! So much fun sitting around the fire with a candle ceremony, singing, eating smores and all kinds of fun!

 

Luckily the rain held off to float to our final point and head back to finish setting up camp for the next day or so until the chores were finished and... i headed out water skiing with the boat counselors! We had a fantastic time on the beautiful Raystown lake as I water skiied and even drove the boat around the lake! What a great day!! It was to get even better as we got into our crazy disco bowling outfits!!! We had hit up the local goodwill store the day before, as well as the bunk junk closet to look our very best for the evening of craziness heading into State College to go disco bowling! We all looked a treat in our crazy outfits and had such a fantastic amazing evening with all the staff! And so ended staff training, such a fantastic time with such a fantastic group of people that it feels like we have known each other forever. It is crazy to think we have only been here a week as it feels like so long we have done so much and had such fun!! I can hardly believe this is a job!!

Ourfinal day, Sat was spent recovering and doing final chores in town before the campers will arrive Sun!! woohoo!!! camp!!!

 

There is only one computer for all the staff to use here at camp which is quite intermittent and no time at all for ourselves so wont get an opportunity to update much, but this camp is just amazing, all the people also and it is definately one of the most fantastic things i have ever done! i cant wait for the kids to arrive tomorrow!!!!

Love k xxxxxxx

 

P.S. sorry i cant upload my pic`s, it is tooooo slow here!!!!!!

 

 

 

 
Campers.... summer fun for 60! updated

2008-06-22 to 2008-07-15


 Sun 22 Jun... day one of campers! The first arrivals began aroundlunch as we ran to greet the kids and parents and help them to their bunks before it was time for Justin and I to head off to Washington DC to pick up the international campers from Dulles airport. We crossed through several states and the Mason Dixon line which seperates the northern and southern states ...a hang over from the civil war... and left with enough time to head into the city and see the monuments. Unfortunately the road system, parking system and time transpired against us and could not get there. Unperturbed we decided to head somewhere niceish for dinner before finding there was no food at the airport, we were not able to get off the food exit and then ended up the wrong direction at the food stop that was closed on Sundays! Finding a servo (or gas station if you are American!) we found Subway and then sat on the cold hard floor of the airport (because of course there were no seats!) before our first camper arrived. The final one finally cleared customs an hour after we expected, but managed to sign for him and jump in the car to begin the marathon journey back to camp, arriving after midnight!

 

I have tried for about 3 hours to try and write this blog, but it is so difficult!! SMA is this amazing surreal perfect fantasy place and i cant even begin to describe or give it justice! So much happens each day and night and it is full of the most amazing people... hopefully the photos can give a better idea! It is full on and we do get tired, but I wouldnt swap it for the world. Sooo here goes....!

Day 1 began with meeting the girls in the cabin myself and another girl Taysha were bunk captains of - right girls (... the cabin fartherest to the right!) and beginning activities. A regular camp day consists of:

0700 staff meeting

0800 wake up the campers and breakfast

0830 crew (group chores)

0930 morning activity

1230 lunch

1330 afternoon activity

1730 power hour of freedom

1830 dinner

1930 evening meeting followed by evening activity

2145ish snack

2200ish bed

...Except for one day a week ( Sun) which is all camp day with a sleep in, bagels and donuts for breakfast, bunk cleaning and skits before everyone heads to the lake for a day of fun with a BBQ dinner.

The activites we do areeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee:

cooking

art and craft

water skiing/ wakeboarding

rockclimbing

canoeing

mountain biking

rails to trails

hiking

berry picking and baking

windsurf / sail

soccer/ tennis / ultimate frisbee / frisbee golf / softball / tennis/ volleyball

community service activities (i.e. volunteer work every sat)

 

So every day we have an awesome exciting activity to go on and have fun with all the kids playing some cool game! In the evening we do so many different crazy activities, (mostly dressed up from the fancy dress closet here called bunk junk!) but some of my favourites are disco rollerskating, Jud Games ( so called as they are with the director Jud!), capture the flag, campfire, the dance and talent show.

Onefine wed morn we also woke up the kids early, herded them into the vans abd began our 3-4 hour drive to Hershey park!! (www.hersheypark.com) It is `the sweetest place in the world` and is this large theme park full of heaps of rides and roller coasters! We the staff dress up in crazy hats and had an awesome time! Our other massive day activity was another early start, big van drive and white water rafting extravaganza on the Youghagany River at Ohiopyle! It was an awesome day, I was flung out once in the rapids, but the other counselor in my boat, Brian managed to somehow find me, grab me and pull me out before I hadeven fully resurfaced, which was pretty impressive, even if ripping my life jacket in the process! The next time I ended up floating down the river with another camper from my boat, Zane for a few hundred meters before being rescued by another boat. We had a close call with another briefly being pinned between a rock and the boat which was unbelieveably scary, but we all followed protocol and made it happen. I also managed to hit a dead porcupine on the way home which left its quills in the wheels of the car!

 

Another of my favourite days was the 4th of july, American Independance Day where we woke up the campers singing the national anthem that Red Beard had taught me the night before, and then that evening headed into state college to watch the fireworks in a park with all the kids. That was also my first experience seeing so many fireflies everywhere! They are the most amazing creatures and i even managed to catch one! They are literally everywhere in the fields here and so amazing to watch!

Another amazing day was the rock climbing overnight where Spike and I drove severalhours with our climbing team down to the PA border into Caledonia State Park. We arrived too late to climb, but stopped by the Appalachian trial where Spike was hiking for 7 weeks before camp and picked up some hiking hitchhikers which was great fun. We camped overnight and climbed the amazing rocks the next day before the rain started!!! I then had my first experience of driving the about 3/4 ton trl behind the 15 seater can along the dirt roads (on the right!!) in the pouring rain with a van full of hyped kids!! Crazy fun!!

 

We also do community service activities each saturday afternoon. The ones I did this session were Alex`s lemonade stand where we dress in bunk junk and give lemonade for donations for the Alex`s Lemonade Stand charity which raises money for pediatric cancer research, carrying on the work of a little girl called Alex who died of cancer. At one instance the massive cooler holding the lemonade wouldnt close off and i couldnt stop laughing as kid after kid held their mouth under the stream and drank lemonade until they were going to explode so we didnt waste it!

State College, which is the city near us also had an arts festival which we took all the kids into. As that was my night off, Brian, Foxy, Red Beard and I met up with Pam and Biff in town and had dinner at the funniest Austrian restaurant that I have ever seen with the staff constantly abusing us, throwing stuff at us and who knows what else the entire time!!! It was hilarious!! We then headed to a local irish pub which had the most amazing atmosphere with live music and heaps and heaps of people sending chants around the tables! it was awesome!

 

We have a super chef at camp, Diane and she cooks awesome dinners for us all each day... It is amazing! I have also discovered I love Bagels...in fact they are probably my favourite american food! I immensely dislike peanut butter an jelly though and far out is that food a national obsession!! The cheese is also his crazy fluro orange and it comes in liquid form! so gross! There was a massive bowl at dinner one night and i made the error of thinking it was pumpkin soup...... sooooooooooooooooooooo gross!!!!

 

The session ended with a talent show on the second to last night which was absolutely amazing to see how talented all our kids are!!! The staff also sung Take me Home Country Roads with entirely new words to fit SMA ... country roads, take me home to the place I belong... Pennsylvania, Stone Mountain.... which had most of the camp crying by the end as well. The last night concluded with a massive candle ceremony where everyone received a candle with a person`s name on it and they got up, lit their candle and said something nice about them which was absolutely fantastic.

All too soon, Dunk and I were loading kids into the van to take them home again. We had the NorthEast van which headed up through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York to Connecticut, which was about 10 hours drive. After dropping all the kids at the points we ended in Westhaven, Connecticut, checked out the beach and Yale University before attempting to find a hotel to stay in for the night. With our massive van we struggled to fit through the underground parking stations, carefully picking our way to avoid hanging pipes before managing to find a hotel in budget, Hotel Duncan, that also happened to have the oldest hand operated elevator in Connecticut which was pretty cool! We found a bar showing the baseball all star game, made lots of new friends, got free bread for dinner and managed to procure free yankees paraphanalia which was awesome!

Our day off we quickly ran to the van to find it still there and free ofparking tickets, much to our delight! We then drove the several hours into New York City! Dunk took me on a guided tour of all the sights which was awesome! We ate street hotdogs and saw Times Square, the Rockafeller centre, Central Park, Ground Zero and the Statue of liberty!

I can hardly believe that the entire session just flew by... it seems to have gone by so fast, but it also seems like i have been here forever! It is still so fantastic and i am having such a great time... very very busy though and tired! Sorry my blog is so disjointed! I just cant seem to put everything that has happened into words!!

Thanks for all the messages!!! love k xx

Just for a different perspective (in case you want to readmore!!!:+) ) this is from Jud,our director`s blog:

What an exciting first week at Stone Mountain Adventures! We kicked off our first session having all of our campers go through our Ground School for rock climbing–each camper learned how to belay for a climber, including knot tying and proper safety techniques. The first few evenings we spent playing large silly group games, and on Wednesday night we had a campfire! The kids broke up into groups and performed classic campfire skits, complete with hilarious costumes from our costume box.

           The performance bug carried through to our Invention Convention–it is impossible to say which was better: the inventions or the skits to sell them! Regardless, all the campers had a great time watching one another’s skits and dancing under our disco lights during the intermissions. Speaking of disco lights, we danced as best we could on wheels during our camp trip to Penn Skates roller skating rink in State College. 

           This past Sunday, we spent the morning cleaning our bunks and straightening up around camp, then celebrated our hard work during an All-Camp Day at Greenwood Furnace. We swam in the chilly water, enjoyed ice creams from the snack bar, and played a few great games of ultimate Frisbee. Sunday night finished up with a good old-fashioned cook-out!

           Tonight we’re off to play Capture the Flag–may the best team win, and may we all have a great time! 

Stay tuned as Anne&amp;Jud are expecting the arrival of their new baby any day now. Anne is due on July 3rd!! P.S. Baby Molly was born safe and well!!!

 
Session 2.... the shoe is good for 52!

2008-07-17 to 2008-08-13


Driving our way through the country, picking up the kids from the North East in the van, after another full day of driving (we did about 800miles in total... i think... stupid imperial system!!) Dunk and I arrived back at camp ready to begin session 2 with a fantastic new bunch of kids!

The title is soooooo camp for me! In evening meeting we all pick activities for the next day. If there is more kids wanting the activity than space available, then we throw the shoe and whoever it lands on gets the activity, until all the places are gone. It is funny how the saying becomes part of everyday life!

This session I also got my first opportunity to head to Belleville to the Amish Markets. Central Pennsylvania has a large Amish population and we constantly see them around in their horses and carts on the road. It was interesting to see first hand their way of life and how they intereact with the general public. I almost hit a deer on the way home as well!!! We see a lot of wildlife around and this one bounded out of the bushes on the side of the road right across the road in front of me!! I have no idea how I missed hitting it, but it was so close!! that certainly got the adrenalin pumping with a van full of kids!!

The session runs fairly well the same as the first in structure, with changes here and there depending on whatever happens! So far second session has seen us battle the rain most days, but at least it is still warm!



 One of the highlights from second session was an all day climb Spike and I took a group of kids on to Bilgers Rock, about an hour and a half away from camp. The rocks were so gorgeous and we had so many different routes to choose from. Here I also set up the majority of a climb for the first time which was really really cool clambering over the top of the rocks to set up all the anchors. On the way home the kids also taught me how to speak `american` with phases `helloooo, how are you?` and `oh my gawd, peanut budder` which ended up becoming a common catchphrase at camp... soooo funny! We also tested them out on a poor unsuspecting american walking down the street on the way home which was was absolutely hilarious as the poor girl had no idea what to do at all! 

 

 During 2nd session the water was so high in the Youghiogany River white water rafting that we had to have professional guides in each boat as it was too dangerous to just have the counselors do it as per usual. As a consequence we finished the river really quickly and had some extra time to head to the natural water slides near by. The water was rushing through the rocks so we psyched ourselves up and one at a time jumped into the churning water to be smashed against the rocks and then be pulled out at the bottom...awesome fun! Very painful though as we all got a little bumped and bruised... with one of my fingers looking seriously like it was broken! Luckily several days later I managed to begin moving it again so all was well with the world again! I then managed to somehow step on a bee which caught itself in my sandals and stung the bottom of my foot... I had forgotten how painful those things can be! 

 

 I also ended up with bright red streaks in my hair courtesy to one of the campers who spent some time dying it during a tie dye activity which was pretty cool... thanks Leah! One of the other great things about camp is you swim so much on all the activities that it doubles as a shower... it was bad though in the last week of camp when i headed to the bathroom only to realise that it was so long since i had a shower i couldnt remember which of the taps was the hot and cold as they were both identical! hmm yes... far too long, but soooooo camp!!! 

 

 Sleeping out under the stars one night I also got the opportunity to see more shooting stars than I could have ever imagined! It was phoenominal to see them shoot across the sky so brightly and so constantly... amazing! 

 

 So many awesome things happened it is difficult to describe them all! I also was lucky enough to go wakeboarding for the first time and have some amazing face plants! As well as having the opportunity to drive the boat and actually tow some other boarders as well which was amazing. I know i am using that word a lot sorry, but it is impossible to describe it any other way!! 

 

 What am amazing summer it was and I could hardly believe it as the last day of camp following the all night movie marathon dawned very early as everyone was up and ready to see off the first vans leaving with the kids. Slowly the kids vanished with the last being picked up in the late afternoon before leaving us to play games and chill by the volleyball campfire. Red Beard and I also headed into the Huntingdon county fair to admire the mass of mullets and all the crazy fat and sugar filled American food before randomly encountered one of our returning vans following us on the way home! 

 

Van return day was i think the first time that I had been by myself for more than 5 seconds in months! It was a good opportunity to chill out and listen to music as we convoy drove the several hours back to the hire place. Those not driving had packed up the canoes ready and we met on the little Juniata river to all float peacefully down the gorgeous river for the afternoon.

 

Camp cleanup was still on going as I gathered 10 bags of international and abandoned bedding to wash and leftovers for goodwill. I knew there was a lot of laundry, but it wasn`t until we had used every single machine in the laundromat and still had left over washing that I realized how ridiculously funny it was! Somehow we managed to get it all done and not annoy too many locals! A candle meeting up in the gorgeous horse pasture hills was a really nice (but super cold!) way to end the afternoon before we sat down to a delicious staff dinner followed by a toga party, campfire and karaoke in honour of the Olympics. Jud had told us about how beautiful the sunrise was from the candle ceremony place and so we grabbed our bedding and headed up. Unfortunately there were horses everywhere as we barricaded ourselves in the benches left over from the candle meeting and listened to them galloping around us before deciding to come and visit, their giant heads inches from ours! crazy crazy crazy!!!!

 

 

Still so exhausted after the summer and not yet caught up on sleep, we awoke for the final clean up and massive task of finding all our stuff and packing. It was really really sad to be leaving the farm and Jud and Anne after having such an amazing summer, working with such amazing people, being so welcomed and the farm really feeling like home. It was also the first time I had actually really unpacked and stayed in one place since I left home so it also felt a bit strange and sad to be on the move again but I am sure I will get back into the groove of things again soon. Especially after some well earned rest in Mexico! I decided that I really needed it after camp and then realized I had been going non stop without a single day of resting or doing nothing since I left home.

 

Camp was such an amazing experience I am now looking at modifying any plans that I will have to make sure that I am in a position where I am able to return in 2009 for my second year as a camp counselor!

 

 

I will write soon about the visit of my my good friend Senora Monty and her husband Mick visiting me here at camp on 01 Aug from Sydney which is super exciting and I can not wait for it!! Hi guys!!! love you!!! xoxooox!!

Livin la vida loca ... PA, NYC, Cancun to Isla Mujeres UPDATED

2008-08-14 to 2008-08-22


 

Our spirits were soon lifted as the majority of the staff all piled into cars for a roadtrip to Philly to see Radiohead! After an amazing concert we all somehow fitted on the Beard`s brother Jonathon`s floor and crashed exhausted. After seeing the beautiful boathouses (the famous view on puzzles), a tour of south street, and the markets with Philly cheese steaks it was time for the sad farewells as the foreigners all left on the amtrack (the amazing train system!!!) to New York. Arriving in New York we were given wide berths and stares at Koni, Foxy and I, the 3 of us in backpacks tried to somehow make our way through the hordes of people to the subway. Bags trapped in the doors, knocking into people and all kinds of crazy times we got out at our recommended stop and could not find the hostel street anywhere... and no locals could help us either even though it was a large street and only a few streets away in their neighbourhood??! so bizarre. Arriving we were told the computer system was down and we could not get rooms as previously told and so began the epic task of calling every single hostel in New York to try and find a vacancy.... a near impossible task as everything was booked solid. Finally, over an hour later we stumbled across one and had to split up, Foxy and I saying goodbye to Koni and quickly made our way there, arriving in the dark, hours and hours after first arriving in NYC! Our hearts stopped one more time before we finally had our dorm and could also finally have a shower! Wow, hostelgate! as Foxy would say. What a crazy night!!

 

At the crack of dawn the next morning the alarm went off and I caught the subway to meet Koni as we had planned... arriving in location she was not there which was strange until I figured out that there were 2 stations with the same name in 2 different locations!!! I quickly made my way to the other 125 th station, arriving over half an hour after the meeting time to no Koni there either! Checking out all exits of all sides of the road, time was against us so I found the bus and headed into the airport. A few minutes later Koni rocked up as we both laughed about our morning. It turns out she also realised that there were two 125 th street stations and had been at the opposite one to me and then as we each went to the other we had somehow crossed paths and missed each other!! It was hilarious as I heard Koni recount trying to run down the road in the rain with her backpack to make it in time and slipping straight on her butt!! Luckily when she arrived, the lady I had been talking to about the situation recognised her and told her I had left for the other station so she knew we were chasing each other across the city!!

 

Checking in we hit the next hitch as my ticket had not come through from the travel agent onto the airlines computer. After running around in circles for a bit and ending up with no ability to call the travel agent for several hours until they opened i waved goodbye to Koni and lay down on the airport floor with all my worldly possessions to pass the next few hours napping... stranded at the airport! Finally after spending forever on hold with the travel agent (ATI for anyone out there not wishing to use them!!!) they realised that they had screwed up the charging of the credit card and got me onto a flight the next day, the best they could do and still insisting it was my fault! After many words I ended up ringing around the airlines and finding a flight that evening... from Newark!

 

I then began my epic voyage to Newark, and after 12 hours of carrying my backpack around checked in, but was then targeted for a random 100% everything check.... fun fun fun! I thought it was just not meant to be as the weather then turned and the flight was delayed. We finally managed to board the aircraft, but then sat on the tarmac for the next hour waiting waiting waiting,.. or in my case sleeping, sleeping, sleeping as I still had much much sleep to catch upon!! (...Bring on relaxation Isla Mujeres!) Luckily the aeroplane ride gave me ample opportunity to write one of those famous complaint letters to ATI I love to send so we shall see how that goes!

 

Arriving into Cancun I got to a hostel after midnight and went straight to sleep only to wake up the next morning and find Koni in the bunk above me!!! awesome! Cancun was stifling hot and also so touristy so we grabbed our bags and jumped on a ferry straight over to Isla Mujeres where we found white sand and sparking clear turquoise water... so beautiful! ... even if that gorgeous sand did get absolutely everywhere!! Koni and I had an awesome time and learnt several valuable life lessons such as: 

 

 
 even if you are on a tropical island, attempting to eat an entire pineapple will result in pain and serious burns to the lips, tongue and mouth! 
 
 although a while coconut is not quite as painful, it is also impossible! 
 
 it is surprisingly easy to fall out of a hammock! 
 
 sleeping in a hammock on the beach (as awesome as it sounds) is FAR from awesome as it makes you motion sick, cold, sore and COVERED in every bite known to mankind 
 
 even giant comedy hats will not protect you from becoming fluro red in the intense heat

The island was brilliant, as was our Poc-Na hostel, our home in the Caribbean...right on the beach!!! A million dollar location, complete with sand, hammocks, palm trees and bar! We were super exhausted after camp so randomly slept lots, swam and watched fish swim around us, pelicans dive, the most beautiful sunsets and brought delicious fish fajita`s for about $2USD!MMM mmm. We walked the entirety of the island ( about 16km) and died of heat, but had a great time checking out all the little local uncommercialised areas, the turtle farm, mayan ruins and had a grapefruit and granola bar picnic on the coast at the easternmost point of Mexico before watching the sunset. A-Mazing! The island had the craziest houses on the way home too, shaped like shells, coloured like sorbet, or from movies! Ahh to have that much money!!! 

 

We also got up super super super early one morning to catch the ferry to the mainland and head off on a tour ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof Chitzen Itza! We had some more quality sleep time before being harassed non stop by the sellers at the tourist shop we were taken to. We made it out alive (just!!) to the massive heat and humidity of Chitzen Itza and were so impressed. The contrast between the colours of the rock, the grass and the sky was gorgeous and the Mayans were amazing, building the craziest acoustics in the area so if you clapped near the main pyramid a echo sounding like a bird came back to you every time, or a snake sound near the Chac Mool monument, or like you were clapping through a surround sound system in the games arena!! so amazing!

 

We learnt about a crazy game the Mayans played where a 8 pound ball was passed around until it had to be hit by the team captain through a small hole about 5 or so metres up that had an inch spare around the ball to the size of the sideways ring with either his elbow, knee, hip or head! crazy loco!!

 

There was also a huge area, Old Chitzen which was what the peaceful Mayans used before joining forces with a warrior civilisation, the Tolongs for protection.

 

We then visited a natural sinkhole which is where the ground collapses and the underground river comes up! It was so gorgeous! The rain also started which was amazing to cool everything down... including my camera unfortunately!!!! All my pics from here on in are on Koni`s camera! Finally we made it to our traditional mexican `lunch` about half past 4!! Justm in time before we died!!!

 

Leaving Koni and the island was sad, but it was time for my next adventures as I gatecrashed a random cab of germans for a cheap ride to the airport and headed onto my vivaaerobus to Texas!

 

 
Brunch, Booze, Hurricanes and History... Welcome to the deep South, USA!

2008-08-22 to 2008-09-02



 Arriving into Austin, Texas, my immigration pain began as after standing around for about 20 mins whilst the official decided on how to process me (yes... I am aware leaving the US on the visa I had wasn`t the smartest decision I ever made!!!). I was then sent off to wait in the segregated cubicle area whilst everyone else was processed and they all stood around staring at me!! I was finally called back through and escorted by my new friends to an immigration officer who after intense questioning decided to grant me almost 3 weeks before I had to leave the US... like an hour later!! Not quite the October departure I had hope for, but a 100 times better than the deportation I was secretly fearing!! 

 

The officials refused to pass on a message to my Texan friend Taysha McKibbon from camp who was picking me up so heading out I couldnt find her and figured she must have left! At that stage a massive storm rolled through and Taysha came running in -turns out there are 2 airports in Austin and she was at the other one so all worked out well in the end!

 

We drove about an hour into College Station, the college town for Texas A&amp;M university where I met up with Taysha`s friends and brother and checked out the music festival in town, which was awesome. Driving a few hours into Edna, about an hour outside Victoria we arrived at the McKibbon residence and were immediately given margarita`s and food–the texan way! Texan`s are so state proud it is awesome! There are texan flags, texan stars, and we ate of texan plates off a texan table with texan serviettes! Yep! I tried grilled Brisket, which is a really southern dish... kind of like BBQ`d corned beef! And also over the coming days, met more people, had lots more drinks, nice food and even Tex Mex food which is really delicious. I also made a pavlova which was a huge hit...i have never met anybody who doesnt love that dish!!!

 

I decided to have the true American experience and catch the greyhound across 4 states to meet my ADFA friend Bria in Mobile, Alabama. Finding the bus stop was a mission in itself as it just leaves from a random service station with no sign, but we made it....just–luckily the bus was late! And so I began my day long journey with all sorts of crazy people in need of a shower and staring at me! Changing buses in Houston, Texas I ended up behind a gentleman I had noticed earlier in a brand new clean white t shirt, brand new bright blue jeans and a little plastic container with a bible and some clothes. I had a feeling that he was a freed prisoner, and after starting a conversation with him, it turned out to be true! Soooo turns out I cracked the US government`s secret method of transportation! :+) He was a very interesting guy to talk to too as I learnt all about his family! crazy!

 

On the bus, I was dreading some of the people getting on sitting next to me, so it was a crazy coincidence that the only other backpacker I have come across ended up next to me... and turns out he was australian too!!! From Ulladulla! Nathan and I spent the rest of the ride talking which was just as well as the bus was sooo painful we couldnt sleep anyway!! The bus had random stops, turned on the lights and forced everyone off, even at 1am in the morning??!what the??! so bizarre!

 

Bria also got a taste of the craziness that is the greyhound, getting up at 3am to pick me up from the greyhound station in Mobile, Alabama...thank you Bria, love you!

 

I had an amazing time in Mobile, thanks to the hospitality of Bria, Chris and 6 year old Bannon! Bria and I had cocktails on the causeway watching the sunset, I went out on a river cruise on the Delta, a massive wetlands area which has about 7 rivers before it hits the gulf (which is a company partly owned by them) and saw all kinds of awesome flora and fauna... including swimming crabs–I had no idea they did that! I drove to Blakeley state park, which is the site of one of the last battles of the civil war and is so well set out you can follow the battle, see where the troop front lines were, ramparts (...trenches!), gun emplacements, the cemetery etc! It was really interesting. I also came across lots and lots of banana spiders ( who also have the strongest web in the world... which I found out the hard way!!), rattlesnakes which I definitely tried to keep my distance from! and all sorts of other cool stuff.

 

It was the labour day long weekend, so I was lucky enough to have Bria and Bannon take me out to Fairhope, which is an absolutely gorgeous small town about an hour away which reminded me soooo much of perhaps the blue mountains or little places in Victoria. It was definitely one of my favourite American places so far! At dinner on the causeway we were also lucky enough to see a medium sized alligator in the water from the deck, and also ate crab claws, which is a very southern dish... delicious!

 

The Grand Hotel at Point Clear has an amazing history of being an old hospital during the civil war (the 300 personnel that died there are buried on the grounds), and then also a mess for servicemen during the world war. Today, redone as a Marriott hotel, it has the most amazing grounds right on the coast and serves a massive typical southern brunch. Brunch is so big in the south and I can see why as it is amazing! Complete with any delicious food you can imagine, champagne and a jazz band it was certainly a fantastic experience. Enjoying the surroundings with cocktails ( also big in the south!) we were lucky enough to be at the right place as a small marching band came past, rounded up the crowd and took us to the cannon firing as took place during the wars. Hurricane Gustav was threatening the Gulf Coast though and the clouds, rain and wind began to hit us.

 

We had the not so amazing task of preparing everything ready for Gustav to come through. We were really lucky, although there was heaps and heaps of wind and rain and we were trapped inside until the entire weather front passed, we didn`t lose power which was a nice surprise, and although there was debris everywhere, sustained no damage either!

 

We also watched Barrack Obama`s speech at the Democratic National Convention, and later thenext week, Sarah Palin`s (VP candidate) at the Republican National Convention which was really interesting to see first hand and to be in the country during this time.

 

My hair also turned blue/black. Well, I guess it didn`t just happen like that, but blue/black definitely wasn`t the look i was after! For future knowledge, brown hair dye on blonde hair doesn`t do quite what it is supposed to... oh well... It will wash out.. at some stage!

 

I also tried Gumbo, which is a really traditional and well known dish from the south. It is a slightly spicy kind of tomatoey/curry like soup with shrimp or seafood, the vegetable okra and usually served with rice. Okay, I probably should have googled that as it is a bit difficult to pinpoint, but it is absolutely amazing! It takes AGES to prepare though so unless I have a super gumbo in a box I wont be making it when i get home sorry!!! On southern food, chicken salad is also not greens with strips of chicken as we know it, but shredded chicken covered in mayonnaise...in fact no greens at all! Chris also cooked us another popular dish, superfat steak on the grill with a blue cheese sauce, mmm mm!


 
Oregon to 4 days overland west to east across the USA by train...Hellooo 15 states !

2008-09-04 to 2008-09-11


 

Hurricanes gone and all too soon I was leaving the south. The USA certainly doesn`t make itself tourist friendly though as all purchases need to be on US or Canadian issue credit cards unless you make it in person, and often the only acceptable ID is an ID of the state you are in. Needless to say this was the biggest pain in the arse... especially when attempting to book transport over the phone or internet. Sometimes I wonder if I will even get my flight when I get to the airport!!! But again this time, albeit after some pain trying to pay a person who had no idea how to process it, the price jumping because they can, I made it through to have a 100% check at security... again!!! Either I must look really suspicious or far from it as i always seem to be `randomly` targeted for these!! Deliberating over my vegemite tubes I was finally cleared and on my way to Portland, Oregon to visit another Army friend - Dan!

 

Dan was living with a mate in Vancouver, Washington, just outside Oregon... and by gosh, the north west was freezing (compared to the south) as I layered all my worldly possessions! We spent some time a few hours down the coast at the seaside at a place called...have a guess...Seaside :+)... where it was cold, overcast and grey... and looked something like an english winter, not an american summer! Sooo... we did the only thing we could and went swimming! Soooooo ridiculously cold!! It was a gorgeous little town though and we also got to explore other little places such as Historia, eat at a little American diner and drive through some absolutely amazing scenery with massive pine forests and hills everywhere.

 

The area had so much natural scenery so it was beautiful to go walking through different areas and see just how different the environment was to other places in the US. Some other things I will definitely remember about Portland is brilliant Japanese food and the coolest little movie theatre that had roomy lounge type chairs and giant footrests for all... now that is definitely my idea of comfortable! Oh yes... and who would have thought that eggs now came from a carton? yup, 99% egg in a carton!

 

Whilst I was on the greyhound several weeks ago traveling cross country from Texas to Alabama, one of the very interesting people I got to chat to that was sitting behind me swore that the best Mexican food in the world was located at a little place called Taco Bell. For those who aren`t aware, this is a massive fast food restaurant like MacDonald`s, but with Mexican food. Recounting this conversation with Dan he took me in search of one to test out this theory... And the final verdict, after eating Australian Mexican, Mexican in Mexico, South American, the USA and Tex Mex.... it was definitely the worst I have ever had! The moral of the story...the greyhound may not be the best place in the world to obtain good advice!

 

Although I definitely love traveling and meeting people from everywhere, it is definitely really nice to see Australians and have people who can understand exactly what you are saying and laugh at the same jokes that is for sure!!

 

Saying goodbye to Dan, I thought that I would like to see some more of the country and decided to catch the Amtrak ( www.amtrak.com ) across the entire breadth of the USA. Beginning in Portland, Oregon, in the North West I will travel for almost 4 days on the train through Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC to the middle of the east coast!

 

I arrived in the nick of time to have the checked baggage close on me, but the kind attendant chased down the little truck and got it through which was really nice. The Amtrak has first class, sleeper beds and cabins and everything you could want, but for the budget backpacker... the regular coach seat looked good to me! I started next to a lovely American named Bruno who admired the amazing scenery with pine forests, hills and the Columbia river as well as teaching me interesting facts about the amtrak and scenery before the first large stop where; faster than i speed of light I secured my own seat. For those that remember my way to camp all those months ago I caught the amtrack and was impressed with the amount of space and was not disappointed again. There is so much room and reclineability ( if that is a word!) that it is entirely possible to get comfortable and get a good nights sleep which is always a nice surprise to get on transport!

 

When I first climbed aboard the train, I actually moved carriages than where they put me so I could get a seat to myself... but was then sent back by 2 nd the ticket lady. I was really glad I did too as in the morning when I walked outside at the first leg stretch stop I found that the train had been reconfigured during the night, with different carriages added and taken as we met at a link station and they separated depending on the final destination..... hmmmmmmmmmm lucky!! or i could have ended up anywhere! It was crazy though, the train had gone from being about 8 carriages long to about 20, with the snack car and lounge car being moved and the addition of a formal dining car as well... it definitely took me some time to figure out where on earth my seat was compared to the day before once I got back on that was for sure!!! So funny!!

 

Spending the morning in the viewing room, i met lots of new friends, in particular one American ex air force guy who was going to be on pretty much all my trains until about 8 or so hours from my final destination which was awesome so we hung out, played cards and chatted with all sorts of lovely random folk. At one of the stops, a volunteer ranger got on the train and gave everyone in the viewing room a commentary as we went through Glacier National Park in Montana which was really really interesting and made it so much nicer to enjoy the gorgeous scenery when you could understand it too!

 

Near Essex, Montana we passed the Izaak Walton Inn which is a converted railroad bunker where every day people come out to wave to the passengers on the train and everyone waves back, a tradition that has been going on since it was built which was pretty cool.

 

We also passed Indian reservations, the site of battles between the US Army and Indians and the place where Kid Curry, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid pulled their last job jumping one of the trains that I was on!

 

North Dakota also has a huge area that goes all the way to South Dakota called the badlands which has rock formations, open plains, trees, all sorts of animals and billabongs where a lot of ancient fossils and dinosaur relics have been found. Although pitch black when we passed through and couldn`t see it exactly, I was also at the geographical centre of north America, a place called Rugby!

 

Early the next morning we stopped at St Paul-Minneapolis, Minnesota which is midway between the equator and the north pole. This is also the start of the Mississippi River, which was awesome to follow alongside of for a few hours. An interesting point for me as a lacrosse player was the town LaCrosse, where the French used to watch Native Americans playing a game here and called it `LaCrosse`. Cool hey! We also had more volunteer rangers get on and provide commentary for most of the day which was really cool.

 

We had a close call in Milwalkee, Minnesota when we were told we had 7 minutes and so headed out the other side of the station to check out town... when we heard the `all aboard` about 2 mins later! luckily we heard it though and managed to run and jump into the doors in the nick of time! It could have been quite nasty stuck without a single thing in the world!

 

It went so quickly I could hardly believe that I was in Chicago, Illinois and my first leg on the Empire Express was over! It all seems a bit of a blur when i look back already,but it was awesome! Matt and I quickly headed out into downtown Chicago and were impressed at the gorgeous old buildings, impressive Grand Park, the Marina on Lake Michigan... but perplexed by the rows and rows of permanent port-a-loo`s with little soap and hand wash stations everywhere.... like they forgot to build public toilets and then just never bothered! odd! Everyone in Chicago is in a massive rush all the time and we were caught up practically sprinting down city blocks and jay walking as not to get run over by the crowd! crazy!

 

It was back on board, this time on the Capitol Limited where Matt and I were split into different carriages and given allocated seats with people next to us! Definitely a change from the past few days!! There was a lot of trackwork on this line and we ended up way behind schedule and I must say as awesome as the first train was, I was definitely ready to be on solid ground, in desperate need of a shower, to escape the arctic airconditioning and some real food I arrived in el capital... Washington DC.

 

 
Washington DC... land of politicians, American flags and museums to NYC UPDATED

2008-09-10 to 2008-09-18




 The amtrak train arrived into Washington DC about 3 or 4 hours late so I quickly found the metro and headed out to Dun-Lorring, Virginia where I was staying with another Army friend from ADFA and RMC, Occa. His wife Wen and the gorgeous little girls May (almost 2) and Alice (about 8 months) picked me up and took me to their fantastic house in the suburb of Vienna. I spent about a week in DC, catching up with the O`Connor`s, helping set up the house, shopping, cooking, playing with the girls -it was so nice to chill out for awhile and it went so quickly! I also spent some time looking around Washington DC. I think it is definitely a place where I could live! It is beautiful and so easy to get around anywhere with the public transportation. The Washington Monument, the WW2 memorial, the beautiful parks, the white house were a really easy walk around the gorgeous city. Occa and I also headed to the National Air and Space Museum which was AMAZING! And coming from `not a museum person` too!It had soooo many exhibits, everywhere you turned there was a real life space capsules that had been to the moon, the first plane to break the speed of sound, the first hot air balloon to fly around the world, Amelia Earhart`s plane, the Wright Brothers original drawings and actual plane and so many awesome things it is impossible to describe. We were there for hours running around in a hyperactive state seeing all the things that were there.. it was like a real life guiness book of world records! I cant even do it justice trying to explain..... amazing!!!!! 

 

 We also checked out the DC nightlife with all the international students from Occa`s uni which was good fun and saw so many ads on the metro for fat people to sue restaurants for making them eat too much! And it was serious!! They were legal firms requesting people contact them. soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sad! 

 

 

 Arlington Cemetery in DC is MASSIVE. It is kilometers and kilometers and so well looked after. The tomb of the unknown soldier is there and every half hour there is a changing of the guard ceremony which was really well done. There are also the graves of many famous people, such as JFK, military heroes and memorials for those lost in space or at war. It is quite sad wandering around as you see a small sign indicating the military unit i.e. 43/56 th parachute battalion, and then behind it as far as you can see there are just thousands and thousands of identical white headstones for all the soldiers that lost their lives in that unit, mostly in a particular battle. 

 

 The National Museum of Natural History has absolutely everything you could possibly imagine and more, which is amazing in itself, but not really my scene. I did see a turtle skeleton that was bigger than me and the Hope Diamond which was pretty cool. The National Archives was phoenominal though. The original Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence and all sorts of amazing historical artifacts were there, as well as so much interesting stuff on America`s history, politics, space race, military and even top secret documents that had been declassified after the required time period. I definitely could have spent forever in there. The monument and Capitol Hill (where the US parliament is) look amazing at night as well as the sun sets in one direction and the moon rises in the other. So gorgeous! Washington DC has so many amazing (and free!) things to look at and see, you could spend a month there and still have more you want to do. There is also an International Spy Museum that looks awesome that I will definitely be going to next time i am there!! 

 

 Thanks to Wendy I managed to do some culling of excess crap and managed to close my backpack again.... I have NO idea how I managed to amass 17 top pieces from about the 8 i left home with, but you would be proud of us Bern... (Bernessa being the original culler of clothes so my backpack closed when I first left)!!! Waving goodbye and heading off on the Metro again I noticed a guy walking next to me, looking at me and smiling. I didn`t think I looked THAT funny so I started talking to him- it turns out he was on the Metro with me when I first arrived! So totally random at an entirely different time, day and place! Weird! So I now have a new American friend Kenric from strange co- incidences! 

 

 My original plans of staying in America longer had been foiled by the US Immigration officers and I required to change my ticket out. They would not even let me go to Canada as I had hoped !!! so rude!! After over 40 mins on hold to.... yep, my favourite people in all the world–Flight Centre! - I found out directions and headed into an American Airlines office to try and change my ticket. To cut a long story short, after standing at the desk for 3 hours whilst the lovely America Airlines ladies did all they would to work it out, it turned out I couldn`t change anything as my original ticket had been completed wrongly and to change anything I had to first pay all the charges that had accumulated on the incorrect legs–over $10 000 worth. For those that remember all the pain and suffering Flight Centre caused with my ticket before I left, this was just the icing on the cake and they certainly heard about it the complaint letter I sent them that is for sure! 

 

 Luckily the American Airlines ladies were so lovely and felt so sorry for me that somehow they managed to manipulate the system without changing the ticket, calling FinAir directly and getting me on an flight out of the country which I could take on a different date with the wrong ticket. I was so lucky. If i had not have had such nice people there I would have been ridiculously screwed over as my visa actually expired before my scheduled flight. I could not thank them enough. I just hope there are no more nasty surprises coming my way courtesy of flight centre!! 

 

 I found America`s most budget busline to take me from DC to NYC.............. yes,more budget than greyhound! It all started out so well, the bus was nice enough, it was clean.... but wow did that driver need some serious retraining! On at least 5 separate occasions I was glad there were seatbelts fitted as we were jolted off our seats as the bus came to a screeching halt or to swerve or to do I don`t even want to know what! Cheap though... super cheap, I guess you do get exactly what you pay for sometimes!!! 

 

 

 The hostel in NYC was nice... if you like having 12 people crammed into a space smaller than the size of the bunks and backpacks which left no floor to be seen at all! Very entertaining though!! I spent the nights in fear of my life as I lay in my allocated bottom bunk and a massively huge obese person slept in the top bunk, snoring and rolling over so much that I thought the whole thing was going to collapse on my head. Additionally if someone was tall... (or anything taller than me!!!) their feet stuck off the end of the bed you then got kicked in the head!!! nice! Luckily I survived...this time!! Having already been on a tour of NYC during camp and also transiting through on two other occasions I felt almost like a local as I walked around the city and navigated the subway without a map. Walking through Times Square I saw the Naked Cowboy for the first time–the guy that stands on a pedestrian island in the middle of Broadway and plays the guitar and sings in nothing but his underwear. I also saw about a million... no... make that a gazillion people all bumping into each other and jostling along the sidewalks through the city.... a little tooo jam packed for me!! An awesome thing about NYC though is its Deli`s. They have soooo much fresh fruit outside and then inside all sorts of freshly prepared foods and really reasonable prices. It was awesome! And they are absolutely everywhere in the city! I even tried yoghurt covered pretzels (they also come in chocolate) which I had spent the last 3 months criticizing and making fun of to find they actually were quite nice! Aaaarrrggghhh!! I really am turning into an American!!! :+) 

 

 With time on my ends I walked from Times Square down the entirety of Broadway back to my hostel which took at least 3 hours....maybe more! But it was really interesting to see all the city. Along the way I passed a diner that looked just like the one from Seinfeld...so I googled it when I got back to the Hostel and it was! Tom`s Restaurant! Lucky find! 

 

 Kind of glad to be leaving my hostel, the 4 flights of stairs I had to navigate each time with my backpack and the weird inhabitants–as well as my bunk buddy, there were another 2 people that just lay on their bed reading. All the time. Every single time I saw them over the 3 days they were there,in bed, reading... no matter what time of the day! so weird... i hope they enjoyed NYC!!?! 

 

With no billionaire found to marry me for citizenship, and avoiding everyone named `Chuck` or `Chad` (who my crazy cousin Don told me I was going to marry and be stuck in the outback USA), I was forced out of the USA as my visa reached its expiration. Six hours before my plane was due to depart I began my expedition walking, on various subways, and on the airtrain to make it to JFK airport with enough time to clear security.

 

Although I was excited to be heading off on the next part of my adventure and visiting my cousins in Barcelona; America really grew on me–it is not at all what I expected or American tourists lead you to believe. Especially once you get out of the big cities and into the real America, it really is an amazing country and the people are soooooo friendly and welcoming and amazing! If I had been able to stay longer and or get a new working visa I definitely would have! I really look forward to going back for an extended period of time again, especially for something like Thanksgiving if I can!!

 

But one final American story...this really cracked me up as well - sitting on the plane waiting for take off, I read a New York Times... the front page news story was about how a footballer had hurt his knee and then the 2 nd page showed it in full diagrammatic detail. Then front page story In the sports section was how footballers are now wearing sweatbands on their upper arms instead of on their wrists. Yeah America! What a crazy country!

 
My love/hate relationship with Barcelona, Spain...diary tbc!

 Arriving into Helsinki airport, Finland at about midnight NYC time and 8am local time I decided the cold tiled floors did not look attractive enough to sleep on and so jumped on a bus to head into the city to wile away my stopover. And oh my gosh was it cold!!¾pants, a t-shirt and a thin jumper are definitely not suitable attire for a summers day in Scandinavia. Brr!! An overcast and windy 10 degrees after almost 30`s in the USA was just plain nasty! 

 

 I found the people to be friendly and helpful as I wandered around, even if the street names are so ridiculously long and unpronounceable after the first attempt I just had to point stupidly at the map while they smiled and showed me the right way. Even better everyone seemed to speak english as well! Nice! 

 

 Defrosting at the airport and seriously in need of sleep, I decided to `freshen up` in the duty free store and somehow managed to spray some nasty perfume in both my eyes! Now eyes stinging, watering and practically blinded I had no choice but to find a nice cold, hard patch of tiles and rest up, setting my alarm clock for early as the check in staff had warned that the gates frequently move without announcements... soooooooo user friendly! 

 

 Arriving in Barcelona, it was a nice surprise to have no customs due to the schengen agreement with the EU nations, but my joy was short lived as I arrived at the baggage collection area to find someone who must have been playing a practical joke as every single flight that was arriving was using the same carousel. The remainder sat empty as the screen in front of number 4 displayed every flight number and people 20 deep jostling and crushing to get to the front an stand right next to the carousel. Needless to say this took some time!! My flight had arrived early, however I stood at the baggage carousel for over an hour whilst my poor cousin Tony, Dympna and the kids (Liam and Fergal) waited at the arrivals gate wondering what on earth was happening! Hmm yes, good system!!! soooooooo far I am disliking Barcelona! 

 

 We headed straight to my other cousin`s Paddy and Helena`s for a surprise party their son Mark had organised for their wedding anniversary... arriving slightly late thanks to the baggage debarkle! It was a great night and I somehow managed to make it through after no sleep! The next day Liam made me breakfast all by himself with all kinds of combinations of goodies! and then entertained me all morning with his renditions of God Defend New Zealand before we then watched it on youtube (his latest fad! ...but he now knows waltzing matilda too....!!:) ) The fiesta central then continued as Tony, Liam, Fergal and I headed to the neighbours house for another party (which happened to have the world`s greatest date slice that between Tony, myself and the random acrobat we were talking to ate at least half of!!!), then followed this up again on Sunday with another BBQ at Paddy and Helena`s where I then stayed. Barcelona was definitely growing on me! (even if they did try to feed me black sausage.....eewwwww!) 

 

 Monday morning I headed into Barcelona nice and early to jump on el bus turismo and see the city. It all started so well as I hopped off at Parc Gruell and looked around at the amazing park planned by the famous architect Tony Gaudi. It was really a beautiful park with such different structures all with curves instead of straight lines so I decided to walk through the entire place... probably about half way around it started to sprinkle but I was not deterred. But soon the whole heavens came crashing down as I, and hundreds of my closest friends who had stayed to weather the rain tried to make it out of the park! Heading back to the bus stop there was a bit of a queue so I joined this, standing in the rain hoping the bus wasn`t too far away. After a bit of a wait it pulled up and then for a nasty surprise as no one got off to see the park in the rain they wouldnt let anyone else on! By this stage someone in the queue had found a store with those ridiculous plastic bag poncho`s so I managed to obtain one of them looking stylish as I stood by the side of the road... soaking wet...cold...in the rain...for the next hour and a half!! Finally someone at the front of the queue became exasperated and cracked it at the bus person as to why they wouldn`t let us on the top of the bus seeing as only the bottoms were full; and she was like `oh you want to go up there? there`s no reason why not.` It was quite funny actually as i thought this guy might have killed her! But finally we were on the bus, getting rained on, a cold wind blasting us and our feet freezing as about an inch of water sloshed forward and back, up and down our shoes every time the bus braked. Sticking in my headset, trying to avoid getting electrocuted with the rain as i watched sights as Barcelona FC flash by, i heard the commentary say `Barcelona enjoys a mild, warm and sunny climate year round`. Mild, warm and sunny my arse! Today I definitely hate Barcelona! 

 

 Armed with the knowledge from Paddy and Helena that it only rains 30 days a year and I was just unlucky, I nevertheless take my rainjacket, plastic bag poncho and warm clothes and hesitantly embark on the tourist bus for day 2. Lucky i brought a 2 day ticket or I would have definitely been annoyed! I begin at the Olympic Port, the beachfront from when Barcelona hosted the Olympic games in 1992, before seeing lots of the different neighbourhoods and gorgeous buildings around the city. I think my favourite was the MNAC.. the museum in an old palace that overlooked the entire city. Gorgeous! Another amazing thing was the diving stadium from the Olympic Games which was on a hill overlooking the entire city as its open air backdrop. Amazing! 

 

 And then...... rain! Luckily I was prepared and ready this time as the rain pools in a giant puddle on my seat and I decide to check out some local sights... a mistake I was not to make again as the buses then again became full with people refusing to get off and went past without picking up until I managed to flag one down and sit on the rooftop. I saw the remainder of Barcelona from the bus as I refused to get off in case I was stranded again! 

 

 This time I survived the entire day and headed out to Paddy`s work at Diagonal Mar to meet up with him and head over to Tony`s together.... until we got stuck in a massive,massive traffic jam! Today I am definitely undecided about Barcelona! 

 

 As it was the festival of La Merce, Wednesday was a public holiday so Tony took Paddy and I down the world`s muddiest, slipperiest, wettest downhill track, in the dark, which we somehow managed to stay upright on AND make the train! Arriving in the city we headed to an awesome little cocktail bar and then followed the street parade of the giants down las Ramblas to arrive at a tapas bar for dinner where you could just throw all your rubbish on the floor, from napkins to fish-heads to toothpicks...everything! it was great! We had a fantastic tapas seafood dinner and entertained ourselves as one of our fish `escaped` and make it down the bar to our dining neighbours! 

 

 Through the city there were thousands of people everywhere, it was crazy! We eventually ended up in a plaza listening to a band that was performing on the stage and paying out the people who brought those ridiculously expensive red roses from the guys walking around everywhere. We then met an American guy from Missouri named Steve (no, not Chad!) who decided that he would buy me one which we found absolutely hilarious... at least he never figured out we were laughing at him!!! 

 

 

 Where Paddy and Helena live in Sant Sadurni is right in the middle of the cava region (the champagne, but it`s not french!) and there are heaps of really nice wineries really close by; so Paddy and I headed to Friexenet to go on a winery tour which went into so much detail about the processes, it was really interesting; especially how they freeze the to remove the sediment! We also got a train ride through the cellars! 

 

 Helena works at Sumamarrca so we then headed out there where she took us through every part of the winery, even to see the grapes being mushed and the electronic board that shows which machines are working and when. The buildings are actually a part of a 15 th century paper mill and in the cellars you can still see where they used to do the different parts of the process! Now I love Barcelona! 

 

 Unfortunately I was then struck down with the cold from hell and couldnt manage to do anything for a few days. I guess sitting on an open bus, soaking wet,in the rain in Barcelona`s `mild warm climate` will do that to you!! Today... I am less than impressed with Barcelona. 

 

 Tony and the kids were heading up to their Masia (farmhouse) in the country for the weekend, so on Friday I managed to drag myself out of bed and begin the journey to Tony`s house. Heading to the station I asked for directions and the metro lady wrote out an entire page of directions where I had to use every single one of Barcelona`s various public transport systems whilst assuring me it was the only way to get there. Highly dubious I attempted in vain to follow these directions, and, surprisingly enough, ended up nowhere near where I needed to be. After a lot of pain asking for directions, where either no one wanted to help, pretended not to understand my spanish, gave me entirely contradictory directions and finally sent me to other wrong places (even police and metro staff!!!), I finally found a public telephone to call Tony which proceeded to take my money and not connect me. 12 Euros later and several km`s tracking down payphones that actually worked, I finally got directions I could understand and arrived at the meeting point. feeling like death and entirely over it, almost 4 hours after I left for what should have taken less than an hour and a half!! The experience was probably the worst so far on my entire trip! Being sick certainly didnt help though...But today, I definitely hate Barcelona!!!! 

 

 

 
Goodbye endless summer, hellooooooooo Finland!

2008-10-01 to 2008-10-09




 Arriving in Finland, I braved the cold, wind and rain to squash onto the peak hour tram with the rest of the city to meet my couchsurfing host Arto. Over the 3 course dinner he cooked I heard about all his trips and the year he spent riding his bicycle around the world. pretty cool! Unfortunately the finnish weather wasn`t to be good to me either as the rain and freezing cold continued as I braved sightseeing in the city. The good thing about it though is the fact that Finland recognises it has crappy weather and so built a massive proportion of the city underground to make life more bearable! 

 

 Looking at the forecast and seeing no change, Arto loaned me some waterproof shoes and pants and we jumped on the bicycles in the pouring rain for a cycle tour of Helsinki. It was gorgeous peddling through the city as there are so many cycle only lanes set aside which makes it so easy. We headed to Seurasaari, which is an island open air museum with traditional 18 th century houses and lots of gorgeous parks. Continuing on we arrived at a local squat. Here squatters actually have rights and are protected once they move into a place. The owner cannot make them move unless he shows plans for the use of the building. Then, if that is the case, they are then given another property to take over! The building was actually really quite well taken care of as well ( even if every square cm was covered in graffiti artwork!) And there were posters showing the rules of the squat and jobs that needed to be completed as well. 

 

 We continued riding through the paths and parks into down town Helsinki to see the market hall, the gorgeous old buildings, the street from the 1800`s, the beautiful lutheran cathedral with a swedish choir singing and the national library which is amazing! 

 

 I am not sure who came up with the theory of once you learn how to ride a bike you never forget because i managed to fall off twice!! It was quite entertaining though and I blame firstly a massive massive hill that refused to allow my pedals to work and then a GIANT puddle I was trying to turn to avoid... but then landed on anyway :) thank goodness for waterproofness! 

 

 After a nightime walk through the parks to admire the waterways and local area and a circus performance at a local club in town, where i randomly met another couchsurfer!; it was time to pack ready for a weekend away at the Teras family cottage on Lake Saimaa that I had kindly been invited along to join. Arto`s dad Timo and brother Erkki picked us up and we began the 4 hour drive up to the lake where for a massive percentage of the country there is more water than land and thousands and thousands of little islands where families have their summer cottages. According to the Lonely Planet `For most Finns, happiness is a ramshackle summer cottage by a lake with a properly stoked sauna` and it seems to be true! 

 

 Stopping along the way we had some finnish food at a little roadside stop before arriving at the cottage on the island of Vasikkasaari.... near Puumala if anyone knows the area! :) 

 

 The common setup is a little wooden cottage, a little wooden outhouse and then closer to the lake a sauna house with a boardwalk leading to the water. We tested the sauna... 80 degrees C and then outside to a temperature of less than 10 degrees...plus windchill! ...and then into the 8 degree water! Oh my gosh it was cold!!! My legs lost feeling and I struggled to get out again, but it was all part of the experience!I definitely needed the sauna after that again that is for sure! We then toasted finnish sausages on the open fire (much different to spanish sausages that is for sure! More hotdogish...but with taste!) 

 

 Walking around the other family cottages the next morning we found wild berries that I had never even heard of–lingin berries and mountain dew berries, so good! We also took the boat out on the lake and it is impossible to describe - it is so beautiful with all the trees, birds, islands, little cottages and beaver nests. We stopped on a tiny island about 20 metres long and tried our hand at fishing for perch and salmon, but unfortunately besides a few weeds and leaves, no luck! 

 

 It was certainly chilly that is for sure as the wind picked up I put on all the clothes I owned and we headed into Puumala for some sight seeing and checked out some other local family cottages (one had actually recently been burgled...the thieves stealing a packet of sausages and an energy drink!) before having a fantastic meal at a little local restaurant. A common dessert here is frozen cranberries covered with a warm caramel sauce. delicious! And then time for another sauna to warm up! What a great lifestyle!! 

 

 Luckily Monday dawned a little less cold and windy so I was able to venture outside looking less like the michellin man! Arto and I walked around the cottage looking for mushrooms and found hundreds! Picking a bag of kanterell... yellow trumpet mushrooms and also black horn mushrooms didnt take long, and is a very common thing for finnish people to do on weekends. 

 

 It was time to head back to the city, on the way seeing a floating sauna boat at Mikkeli (also apparently very common!), more beautiful scenery, the ski jumps used in the Helsinki Olympic Games in 1952 and then a reindeer pizza for dinner!!! yup! even called `Rudolf` on the menu!! And in case you were wondering, it was delicious! :) 

 

 Arto and his family were all so friendly, kind, welcoming, amazing hosts and tour guides and I had the most fantastic weekend with a once in a lifetime all local finnish experience! Timo shouted me dinner every night and we had great conversations about all kind of things finnish and beyond. It was amazing and I couldn`t thank him enough...and all he said was `nice things happen to nice people`. Isn`t that so lovely:) 

 

 By the time we arrived home and prepared the mushrooms by cleaning and taking off the zillions of little forest bugs we only managed a few hours sleep before jumping on the train to head to Tampere where Arto had a IT conference and I was going to look around and meet up with another finnish couchsurfing host. Tampere was a 2 hour train trip from Helsinki, but a world colder!!! brrrrr! I walked around the beautiful parks, looked at the churches and along the side of rapids through the centre of town which used to be used for all the textile factories along the sides. 

 

 Meeting outside her office, Tuula and I went for lunch at the local market hall to try some local finnish food and had a great time chatting. Although black sausage is the local specialty I was not up for trying it after already attempting to eat it in both Argentina and Spain and practically vomiting! The thing I think I will remember most about the food in Scandinavia is the rye bread. It is a really flat, quite hard, dark brown and really strong tasting and not at all sweet. The first time I tried I could hardly swallow, but the more I ate it (not that there was any other choice!) it was definitely growing on me. 

 

 I checked out the water tower and beautiful view of the lakes on either side of the town and then the spy museum!! After the build up (it`s own!!) brochure gave it, it was a little disappointing and small and all in finnish!, but the english book with stories about what the spies got up to throughout the wars was awesome, like a movie script! There was also invisible ink and various other gadgets to try and also a map with known spy locations on it... we even had a spy in Australia during the cold war too! 

 

 After picking up Arto from his conference we headed about 30 mins out of town to the gorgeous little cottage that Tuula lives in right next to a lake in Kylmakoski and cooked up the mushrooms we had picked over the weekend. They were delicious! We also had a HUGE bowl of berries and caramel for dessert which Tuula said she had picked herself. I originally thought she was joking but she was serious! They are so common and with so many forests with these in them she had actually picked them all herself! 

 

 It was a chilly night with a temp of about -3 and as we left the next morning found frost all over the ground and the car covered in ice which Tuula had to scrape off before we left... a ritual the finns do every day for half the year!!!crazy!!! 

 

 Catching the train back to Helsinki there was sunshine!!!!! definitely a nice change from the cold, wet and windy days thus far. I visited the russian orthadox church, the famous baltic herring market where all the boats pulled up to the side of the harbour and sold their fish from them, and then jumped on the ferry over to Suomenlinna, the island fort which was built as a part of the swedish empire to keep the russians out hundreds of years ago. The ruins are really quite well preserved and you can go into a lot of various tunnels and gun towers as well as heaps of paths along the gorgeous coast that you would wander for hours. As you sit on the edge of the island, the massive container ships leave the port and are within about a hundred meters of you on the island as they leave. pretty cool! 

 

 

 Finland in a nutshell - 

- compulsory national service- yep, still! But no one minds. And you cant escape as they cancel your passport if you dont!:)

- free university!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all of it!!!!!!!!!!

- all cars stop for all pedestrians... all the time!

- everywhere has a sauna, businesses, boats, offices, homes, and...the Army! `It is very important` they tell me...`and where else would you take your guests?` !!

- the president is independent and free from any political party

- everyone rides their bikes everywhere,in any weather ...even to the pubs!

- you need to take a test and get a licence to hunt... and play golf!!!!!

- the rule is it is `every mans land` so you can camp, hike, pick mushrooms/berries whatever where ever you want as long as it isn`t in a 70m radius of a persons house!

- friendly AND english speaking people

- cold, cold, cold weather!

- expensive!!!! thank god for couchsurfing or inever would have been able to finish my trip!!

 - I have decided that I quite like the Finnish lifestyle.... lots of fresh food, especially fruit, yoghurt, cereal and bread. mmm mm! 

 - And lots of awesome outdoor activities. 

 

Finally.... one of my favourite things... traffic fines are dealt on a percentage of your income, they are not a set fee - So if you earn a fortune the fine will actually mean something to you! As a result, the world`s biggest fines are from Finland, including a 264 000 euro fine for speeding!!

 

 

 

 

 

 
ABBA, IKEA and my new favourite country... Sweden. NEW PICS

2008-10-09 to 2008-10-17


Arriving in Sweden, I made my way out to Neil`s house, the irish guy I was couchsurfing with. He actually took me in on short notice after the person I had lined up to couchsurf with was deleted out of the program for being sketchy... good timing for me not to have to suffer as well! Neil is being sponsored by the local uni to continue his studies of theories in mathematics after already having completed postgrad studies in France and Poland... all sponsored.... he did explain what it all was but I cant remember what on earth it was now!!! He is also an orienteerer and competes internationally. crazy hey...amazing people you meet couchsurfing. After chatting over lunch I headed into town and was blown away by Stockholm. I think I have definitely found my new favourite city! Although it is ridiculously expensive (as all Scandinavia is) it is absolutely amazing, the people are even more friendly than Finland, the weather is definitely milder and it is beautiful! The city is made of up islands and there are gorgeous bridges and waterways between spectacular old buildings everywhere. Everywhere I walked I was amazed. There were fresh markets in a square in the city, interesting shops, and more underground centres to escape the weather. Sweden seems to be a lot about innovation too as they have a lot of stores with quite handy inventions, one in particular, Design Torget is awesome... you will find everything you never even thought you needed!

 

The Swedish hostels are amazing too...one night I stayed in a massive floating sailboat ( AF Chapman ( www.stfchapman.com ) (where I met Renee from Maryland... Hi Renee!) and then another night I stayed in a jail cell in an old prison! ( www.langholmen.com  ) and yep, all hostels too, not hotels!

 

And everywhere you go you see IKEA furniture and listen to ABBA soundtracks playing. what a great city!

 

The train system is ridiculously convenient too and takes you anywhere you could possibly want to go with constant departures all day every day. You just rock up, buy a ticket from the machine and off you go! And, even better, it is actually quite economical too... a 48 hour train ride could cost 1200 Swedish crowns (kroner)... maybe $240AUD...and that was not even booking ahead. Although I soon discovered they make their money by not having any taps on the train and forcing you to buy water that must have been laced with gold!!

 

I caught the train from Stockholm to Guthenberg, which is Sweden`s second biggest city, on the west coast and slightly south of Stockholm, about 5 hours away; and was equally as impressed as I was with Stockholm! Another ridiculously gorgeous city full of pedestrian only old cobbled streets, pretty old buildings, rivers, bridges and beautiful parks.

 

From Guthenberg I caught the train for about 24 hours right up to one of Sweden`s northernmost towns, Kiruna. which is above the Arctic circle in Swedish Lapland. I know taking an overnight train saves on accommodation but geez this one was impossible to sleep on!! In my many hours of sitting upright trying to sleep I figured out I had taken about 25 overnight transports.. that is like a whole month without sleep!

 

Kiruna is a mining town and it is quite an interesting time for the people as it is currently in the process of being moved to allow the mining to continue closer to the current town centre. And boy was it cold!! I was kind of disappointed when I arrived as there was no snow, but when I awoke the next morning the whole town was covered and it continued to snow all day with the first real snow of the season. Nice luck! Unfortunately my old joggers didn`t really cut it as snow shoes and my feet became nice and wet and frozen as they sank into the snow and my face felt like it was burning from the cold, cold wind and falling snow, but it was awesome...and it isn`t even winter yet!!!

 

Unfortunately it was the wrong season for the northern lights, the icehotel or midnight sun or most other activities but the little town had a little town square, city hall with a exhibition on the town move (in Swedish mind you,but at least there were pictures!), a little museum on the Sami (the native local people) and a museum on the mine and how it impacted the town in an old house built in the late 1800`s that the mine manager used to live in. An elderly lady there gave me a guided tour for free as she just loved the history of the town so much which was really cool and so interesting with so much stuff happening for such a little town!

 

The train back it was actually cheaper to travel in a sleeper courgette than a regular seat and these wernt even full so I had a fantastic nights sleep in a bed with fresh sheets! ahhhh! Arriving back at Stockholm Central I started to put my bag in a locker as I wasn`t meeting up with Neil again until later that evening. As I was standing there a man started talking to me. Turns out he is a Scotsman who lost all his business and money in Iceland and the fall of the world economy, his wife divorced him and he couldnt see his 3 year old son and he had ended up in Scandinavia trying to figure out what to do with his life. I was like, wow, this guy is a mess! But it seemed he just wanted someone to talk to and he ended up buying me lunch... bizarre turn of events. As a side point it was the famous Swedish meatballs and quite nice! :) Although I know I am quite aware it wasnt my responsibility!! but I ended up walking around the streets of Stockholm with him trying to find a travel agency to book him a flight as our discussions had led us to him deciding to head to SE Asia...the Philippines for a few months. He was like so strung up he was walking in circles and didnt even realise! We found one and got his life sorted out and I continued on my merry way...what a crazy day!

 

I walked out to the vasamuseet ( www.vasamuseet.se ), which is a museum on a ship called the Vasa which sunk 30 mins ( about 1200m) into her maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged in 1961 after 333 years under the sea and 95% intact!! It only sank in about 30 m of water and her masts were so tall they stuck out until they got in the way and were chopped off! So many things so well preserved though, there are skeletons and an intact jacket that survived over 300 years below the sea. crazy!

 

The ship was the first of its kind to have 2 gun decks and weight was placed in the bottom of the ship to counteract the top heaviness, but it was loose rocks, so when the ship tilted, all the rocks rushed to that side and it could not be uprighted and slowly filled with water through the cannon holes and sunk! The ship was sailing with family members to celerate the maiden voyage and was to drop these off and pick up 300 soldiers and their equipment on the next island which would have been the right weight to balance the ship.... but it was just a comedy of errors that all added up and caused its sinking!

 

 

I was cooking dinner that night for Neil and I so I headed to the supermarket which was quite an adventure as the supermarkets are so well presented and laid out it is nice just to wander around them! Eventually, with the help of some friendly Swedish shoppers who translated for me I even located everything I was after! It definitely took some time though...even packaging is so different!!

 

My final day in Stockholm dawned cold and windy and rainy... perfect for the day I had set aside to see the open air museum!!! I checked into my awesome prison hostel, had a walk around the prison grounds and headed into Skansen ( www.skansen.se ) which is basically a mini Sweden with representations of all the animals (I finally saw Reindeer!!! woohoo!!! even if they did look a little sad:(), houses and farms from different areas and a town set up with working shops from the 1800`s. You can watch demonstrations of glass blowing, furniture making and various other things using traditional methods. The bakery and little general store were pretty cool and the people serving were in period costume and could tell you the history which was very interesting. Unfortunately the weather was really crappy and due to it being the off season most of the exhibits were closed so I headed into the Nobel Museum to warm up ( www.nobel.se/nobelmuseum ).

 

I didnt realize that Alfred Nobel was Swedish and that various Swedish institutions are responsible for choosing all the various Nobel Prize recipients, except the Nobel peace prize which is the responsibility of Norway. It was really cool! The museum also has a cafe with Nobel Ice Cream which used to be served at all prize dinners (one flavour on the inside covered with another flavour on the outside) and where all recipients who visit the museum sign the base of their chairs.

 

Seeing as I didnt get a chance to see the ice hotel in Kiruna I headed to the ice bar in downtown Stockholm, donned my super warm poncho and headed inside to have a drink from an ice glass in the ice bar which was freezing!

 

I was sad to leave Sweden, the country is amazing and I think it is one of the few places that I loved everything about and could definitely live here! ...if I had money of course!! :) Even the language kind of makes sense! And they somehow managed to get over their quote of really good looking people too! Everything in Sweden is also so convenient, and Stockholm especially, so well organised and easy to get to by walking... or by public transport if you are lazy :)

 
The wettest place in the world and laughter parties in the country full of Norweigans - Updated

2008-10-17 to 2008-10-26


 I arrived in Oslo airport to wait by the baggage carousel...and wait... and wait.. until I heard my name called over the PA system. It turns out my bag had somehow vanished which I had to laugh about after traveling some of the world`s dodgiest and cheapest airlines, it ended up being a legitimate airline in the one world alliance who lost my bag! I couldnt really complain though as it was the first time in 8 months and to be honest I was expecting it sooner or later! It kind of worked out conveniently too as I wasnt meeting my couchsurfing host until that evening so I was going to have to find storage for it in town anyway or drag it around this city. This way it would be delivered directly to my accommodation! Nice! 

I randomly met up with an another Aussie, Paul on the train which was really bizarre and then later when attempting to find Terje in the city ( he looking for a chick with a backpack which of course was missing!) we located each other and when I tried to explain my backpack was gone, he was like `i know!` FinAir had already looked up his address, found his telephone number and called to say they were delivering the bag. How is that for service!! 

Walking around the city, there were buskers everywhere and a real party atmosphere which was so cool! I walked up to the Royal Palace and gardens and watched the guards before chatting with some random Danish guys who had caught the boat over for a day. They were quite comical! 

It was then time to meet Terje and his friend Bjonar to watch a movie in the films from the south festival. We saw a funny one about the Mexican/US border and then a doco about life in Curundu, Panama where the doco maker was there to answer questions which was interesting. 

I had read about a run down, graffitied squat that was operating as a `cafe` serving cheap food in the lonely planet budget guide and found it in the city. There was a crazy mix of people in there, but the food was definitely cheap! and good!

There is so much construction in the city as well, everywhere in the main areas, and also around the city centre, dozens and dozens of druggies hanging out. They are not causing any trouble at all,just kind of hanging out. It is bizarre.

Oslo is not quite as well set out as other cities I had been to recently and to see the various sites you needed to catch public transport out of the city. I jumped on a bus into the Viking Ship Museum which has 3 Viking Ships that were used as burial ships in 800 and 900AD and uncovered last century. Grave robbers had been into the sites, but there were still artifacts and skeletons left which are all on display and the historians? archaeologists? managed to find out so much stuff about life in the Viking times just because of finding these.  

Terje lived about a half hour bus ride out of the city and it was actually a really gorgeous bus ride to his place, past the coast, fjords and islands. The fjords are amazing. Norway is definitely a very beautiful country with the scenery it has. 

The train ride from Oslo to Bergen is listed in the lonely planet as one of the best in the world and I can definitely see why!! It was gorgeous! And so reasonable too at 700Knr return, approx $175AUD for about 15 hours travel. We passed amazing fjords and snow snow snow! We got to jump out too at Finse, the highest station in Europe which was awesome and so pretty! I must attract random aussies lately as the rest of the locals kind of just sat in their carriage and slept, another Sydney-sider Grant and I were the only ones appreciating the scenery! It is just so normal and everyday for everyone else it means nothing! 

Bergen is the wettest city in Europe...probably the world I would say! At least 275 days of rain a year and they have been known to have 3 months straight. So attempting to get to my couchsurfing host John`s house I thought i had escaped...but down came the rain on about 3 separate occasions. John lives in a really nice apartment a short walk from town so it was so convenient! When I arrived some of his friends from up North were over so I got to hear a bit about life above the arctic circle which was really interesting too.

John`s various assistants were from different places too so I got to learn a lot about the country at various meal times which was awesome. 

Donning the thermals, waterproof clothes and umbrella I ventured outside to check out Bergen. It is a gorgeous little city with a really cool vibe to it, kind of like Sweden. It has cobbled streets, o0ld buildings, a beautiful harbour, a famous fish market and an area called Bryggen which is a UNESCO world heritage site built in the 1700`s( or the 17th C, I cant remember now!) with buildings with the really pointy roofs all really close together. It is so cool! 

I also caught the funicular up the mountain to admire the view and then walked down... through the wind and rain of course! 

That evening we were all going over to Johns friend and neighbour Nikolai`s house, for home made pizza which was amazing. I decided to whip up a pav to take over for dessert but the electric mixer did one turn and died...apparently it is dodgy! And so.... I started whisking! And whisking! And whisking! And... so it turns out, it is possible to make a pavlova by hand! It didnt actually take THAT long... maybe half an hour or so and luckily I had a little help from John`s brother when my arm was about to drop off! We had an awesome night chatting and my beliefs continued to be confirmed about Norweigans. Between my Oslo host Terje and all the people I had met across the country and in Bergen I definitely have to say that the Norweigans are overall as a population the most educated people I have met! They all seem so smart and knowledgeable, can have such interesting conversations and know so much about not only their own country, but everywhere else in the world and their english language skills are probably better than¾of the english speaking world!! Amazing people!! I think it also helps that they seem to have a similar sense of humour to us as well! 

Late that night I again braved the outside to head to a pub in town to a Bergen couchsurfing meeting which was fun to meet some more locals and couchsurfers. It is such a great system! 

After too few hours sleep I got up bright and early to find the worst weather I had ever seen! Within literally a minute of leaving the apartment I was absolutely ridiculously drenched, my umbrella was inside out and I had learnt not to stand too close to the gutter after being soaked by the cars traveling past on the road. The rain was coming from all directions and the wind following. Unbelievable! Somehow with moments to spare I managed to find the departure point and hop onboard the ferry to take me to Rosendal on the edge of the S............. fjord which is one of the biggest in Norway. 

Unfortunately the weather was a little too crazy to actually see anything on the several hour boat ride except for the rain and sea water crashing against the windows as we ploughed through the waves. My picturesque day was not turning out exactly as I had hoped, but as John`s brother said to me later `at least I saw the country the way the rest of the locals do!` Luckily the wind and rain dropped off to allow me to walk around the town without being battered to death as I saw the lovely little cottages dwarfed by the magnitude of the massive mountains behind them. There were snow capped peaks and fast waterfalls as well as old churches and a rock park in the middle of a National Park. There was also this cute little cafe that was in someone`s home which was really sweet and did amazing elderflower tea! 

Luckily most places in Norway have heated bathroom floors (... easily the best invention since that drying rack cupboard thing in Finland!) so at least my shoes could dry out overnight which was nice. I spent the rest of my time wandering around Bergen, Bryggen and pulling my umbrella out about 10 times each day! I also went to the Hanseatic Museum which is in an old house in Bryggen and is the history of the area... Fishing has a lot of importance and the first level was full of old traditional dried fish. Mmm mm, Lovely! Leprosy was also prevalent in the area and also treated there so there was a special museum dedicated to explaining this. Unfortunately it was also school excursion day there and there was not enough room to fit everyone in! 

I was catching the night train back and so had my final supper with John and friends and another couchsurfer from Germany who had just arrived at John`s, a girl called Anna. She had never eaten Mexican food before...how crazy is that!!! Chatting into the night I then had to leg it up to the station, but luckily managed to make the train on time! And was surprised with a little night time pack like on a place with socks and pillow and blanket and eye masks and all sorts of goodies! so handy! 

Unfortunately I arrived back into Oslo at half past 6 on a Sunday morning which I then found out the buses didnt start for another hour! And by gosh is it cold that time of the morning!!! 

Terje`s friend Bjonar was hosting a laughter party that afternoon so we headed into the park to participate. I had never been to one before and this one was all in Norweigan so I really had no idea what was going on, but it was a good turn out and really funny!! 

I decided that since I had done it once I could manage to make another Pav by hand as Terje didnt have a beater... and several hours later...ta da! it is possible twice! We also learnt that apples explode when wapped in alfoil in the oven. I have no idea how, but that was definitely weird!!! 

Norwegian lollies are also a nasty shock to the system if you are not expecting it... half of the lollies are actually salty, not sweet and to be honest really quite gross!!! Such an odd concept. And they thought the rest of the world actually ate these as well! 

All to soon again it was time to leave Norway. It was also daylight savings change day so luckily we remembered to change the clocks so i didnt miss my plane! Norway has gorgeous nature and the people are amazing , but wow one could definitely go broke here! The bus to the city return each day was 92 Kroners...about $20AUD, 10 Kroner to use a bathroom...$2.70AUD, museum/attraction entry fee 50-100Knr... $12-25AUD, 2 x oranges/ 2 x apples/ a tiny yogurt about 10Knr EACH...$2.70AUD a loaf of bread 23Knr... $6AUD, internet 2knr per minute... 60knr for half an hour...$15AUD, water 13Knr...about $4.20AUD. Heaven help you if you wanted to eat something proper!! Thanks Aussie dollar...good time to travel to some of the world`s most expensive countries... next stop... Dubai:)   

 
Handbag? Pashmina? Watch? Genuine Fake! And the heat of the Dubai Desert

2008-10-27 to 2008-11-01


By the time I walked to the bus, caught the bus to the city, caught the train to the airport, caught the plane to London and sat in Heathrow airport for a few hours I was hanging out to get to Dubai!! Unfortunately it was again one of those lovely flights where you leave in the evening, but then only a 6 or 7 hours later you have arrived in the late morning in Dubai! Who needs sleep anyway??! 

It was interesting arriving into Dubai airport as all the staff were all dressed in the traditional attire for both men and women which i hadn`t seen in such large numbers before. The queues to get through immigration were long and then the queues for the duty free alcohol almost equally as long as you cannot buy alcohol to have at your home anywhere else within Dubai. 

It is an odd system at the airport where the people picking you up have to wait outside the building in the heat, but there is nothing to tell the arriving people this; so luckily my little bro Barrett managed to get his way inside or it may have taken some time for me to locate him! 

The heat in Dubai was crazy after Scandinavia, and so humid. Along the way to Barrett`s place in Al Karama, we drove past so much construction... the entire place is constantly under construction... and traffic, constantly!! Karama has the majority of cheap shopping places so I spent the day wandering around and getting harassed by the store keepers to buy `pashmina`s, handbags` and `genuine fake watches`!!! They never give up!! 

Barrett, a friend Tam and I then headed out into the traffic jam to the Madinat which is a `souk` or market full of shops and restaurants, in the design of a massive Arabic Desert city and an unbelievable maze to find your way around! There is a moat with fish and boats you can catch and also an amazing view of the Burj Al Arab, the 7 star hotel that is probably the most well known building in Dubai. 

Bright and early we again joined the traffic queues to jump on the tourist bus (www.bigbustours.com). This was actually the best tourist bus I have been on, the buses were frequent, the commentary actually interesting and it was so well set out it was easy! I started the city loop and saw the various shopping malls (there are heaps here!!!), souks, and important things! Included in the ticket was also this awesome walking tour so we headed through the old souk, gold souk and spice souk which have had trading for centuries and crossed the Dubai river on the little abra`s, the local water taxi`s which was heaps of fun. 

Heading out to the beach loop we saw more shopping centres!!, mosques, the beach and drove onto the Palm Jumeriah, the palm tree inspired man made islands off the coast which has a massive water park, hotel and aquarium in a complex called Atlantis. There are massive ceiling to floor glass windows full of ruins of `Atlantis` and fish in the centre which is absolutely brilliant. 

Next on the agenda was Mall of the Emirates, which is the biggest mall outside North America and also has the `Ski Dubai` indoor ski slope... so crazy! Trying to get back home was also crazy sitting, not moving in traffic for over 2 hours... But it was actually quite nice as it was so cool and refreshing after the heat of the day and there were really nice views of the Burj Dubai, the world`s tallest building and the rest of the city. 

Arriving back at the Diera City Centre I decided to brave the free local community buses back to Kamera and joined the queues waiting, waiting and waiting! About 45mins later the bus arrived and we spent the next 45 in traffic before... success!!! Home about 4 hours later than I planned :+). 

The big bus tour also included a Dhow River Cruise (traditional Arabian wooden boat) so I jumped on this the following morning... which was nice...but I was definitely glad I didn`t have to pay for it as I listened to really bad music and the world`s most boring commentary! It was interesting to see up close the old Dubai where merchants had traded for centuries juxtapositioned next to the brand new modern complexes though as Dubai is really such a massive mix of old and new, and new pretending to be old! Walking through the heat I chatted to friendly locals in the old souk and caught an Abra back across the river to head out onto a desert Safari with Barrett! 

We were picked up in a 4wd with 3 Danish guys and had an absolutely awesome evening with them all. We were firstly dropped off at a souvenir shop in the middle of nowhere for ages but refused to be sucked into buying anything! We then headed out into the desert to catch up with the rest of the cars in our safari and joined this massive line of about 20 4wd`s off roading through the desert. It was hilarious watching the cars in front of you slip side ways down the sand and then see how your driver would attempt the same thing to stop your car rolling! The music the driver played kept us laughing as we flew up and down the dunes listening to titanic remixes and all kinds of bizarre dance music! The cars all joined up and we laughed some more as everyone tried to sand board down the dunes before all the cars regrouped at a random camel pen in the middle of nowhere... except our driver just zoomed past and left the group as we all tried to figure out what on earth was going on!! It turns out he was taking us to our dinner location where we had first pick for the dune buggies and camel rides. I felt so sorry for the poor camels though as the handler just constantly pulled them up on their feet and back down on their knees again for all the tourists and they were not happy... refusing to do it and practically tipping everyone off in the process! Inside the desert oasis we could dress up in local outfits, get traditional henna tattoo`s, try sheisha (the local way to smoke), eat a big BBQ and watch a belly dancing show. It was heaps of fun and definitely nice to see another part of the middle east as opposed to the buildings and construction through Dubai. 

Thursday I headed out with Tam to chill out in some of the zillion shopping centres that are everywhere and laugh at some of the ridiculous, but apparently wearable fashions. Dubai is an interesting place as the whole entire Emirate is in a constant state of construction and I think living in the midst of it all would drive me insane! There are also traffic jams constantly 24/7- I have no idea how the place will cope once construction is finished and more people are living there!!! There is no town planning, no street names, no maps, no decent public transport, a massive, massive divide between the rich and poor, practically slave labour for some of the lowest earners, and than also various nationalities that just constantly stare at you all the time...regardless of what you are doing or wearing (and most likely covered clothes to try to fit into the muslim nation!) The local emirates on the other hand are lovely people. They are really so friendly and their clothes are actually really comfortable, cool and perfect for the environment!  

I also found out that another girl I went to ADFA (Uni) with had just taken up a job teaching in Dubai so she arrived to pick me up and we headed out for lunch. Attempting to navigate the Dubai streets we then met Barrett and his flatmate Aaron at Bidi Bondi, an over the top aussie cafe on the water at Palm Jumeriah. Unfortunately town planning does not exist in Dubai and we spent some time driving straight ahead before finding a place possible to do a u-turn at after overshooting the address. Next stop was to join the rest of the Dubai ex-pat community at the fancy dress store getting costumes for Halloween parties that evening. Unfortunately it then took us about 3 hours of driving around in circles (it could have been 20mins!) and going crazy to then attempt to get back to Karama with construction on every street, ridiculous traffic jams, no street names, therefore no maps... and my personal favourite, streets that had previously been going one way, but had changed since the last time they were driven on!!! It was enough to traumatise us for life! We were then late for our respective parties, but somehow managed to get dressed up and arrive without too many more dramas! 

Dubai has a really strong ex-pat community and each weekend there are house parties at different people`s houses. It is not quite what I expected though as everyone is just there to have fun, are really considerate of other people and their things and nothing gets out of hand. It is brilliant! And so much fun! I guess it is because it is a small ex-pat world, but it is awesome and you meet heaps of nice people! 

The city is really safe too and has very little crime. I don`t know whether it is censored or not how much is actually reported, but I definitely never felt anything but perfectly safe. 

I had a fantastic time in Dubai, but all too soon it was again time to say goodbye and move on. Again in need of a lot of sleep I headed out to the airport where you have to be security checked and bags screened to enter the main part of the building before you even can check in! It was about a 7 hour flight to Hong Kong and although the flight was great, between meals and drinks and announcements it was impossible to sleep, so I arrived in HK 6am local time not at all already to face the day after a few nights without sleep!! :+)

 
In 7 flying hours I`ll be landing in Hong Kong...

2008-11-02 to 2008-11-06


That is Khe Sanh lyrics for those that thought it sounded familiar! I am having issues uploading my diary, but will do so as soon as I can!

I somehow broke my memory card in Hong kong so am missing the last pictures of Dubai and first ones of Hong kong, but hopefully the camera shop can fix it this week....!

Back in the shire

2008-11-06 to 2008-11-16


Ahh, back to the land `where women glow and men plunder`, where people understand you when you say things like `thongs`, `arvo`, `heaps` ,`jumper` or `that`s going straight to the pool room!` and even better, everyone else uses them in conversations also! Where you don`t have to choose what to wear as you walk outside as everyone else is also in hav`s and boardies... where everyone has a jar of vegemite in their cupboard and the language is english! Real australian english :+)... great to be home! 

I even fell straight back into driving without a problem... or so i thought as I headed down main roads and just followed everyone else...until I ended up on roads without other traffic and lots of turns... and on a few separate occasions found cars coming straight at me... Lucky the speed limit on base is just 40km/hr. Oops. let`s hope that is the end of that!!! 

Everything also worked out fortunately that I was also in time for the Peru`s Challenge Build a Community Fundraising Ball which was the inaugural ball for the organisation. It was awesome to catch up with Chris, Stu and Pete some good friends from when we all volunteered together earlier in the year in Peru and all happened to be in the same place at the same time for it! The ball was MC`d by Jules Lund who did a story on Peru`s Challenge two years ago and the ball raised $30 000 above and beyond ticket sales by people buying random guinea pigs, llamas, vege gardens and houses which was awesome... even if we did spend the better part of the evening figuring out how to get the butter knives to saw through the world`s biggest chunks of meat! :+) 

The real reason I have ended up back in Sydney is to get my UK working visa, which for some bizarre reason beyond my comprehension I can only apply for it here! So how long till it`s here? How long is a piece of string! Thanks so much to everyone for their support and messages and my next update will be hopefully soon, back to living on the move, out of a backpack, with a travel towel and sleeping sack! What a great life! :+) xxxx

 
The wait is over

2009-01-14 to 2009-01-29


So, I have finally gotten my UK working visa!!! Just as well I wasn`t holding my breath!!! But alls well that ends well anyway and it looks like I will no longer be a passportless prisoner in Australia :+) I have already had to rechange my flights when I hadn`t received my visa as planned so am now keeping them where they are and am off again on 30 Jan. For those that are stressing after details of my last attempted flight changes, don`t worry, this was actually a very painless procedure after I found a new travel agent... thank you Matt at YHA travel!!! No more hours of fun and failure with flight centre for me!  

Waiting in Sydney I have been spending my time earning some $$ working at Hogs Breath on Cronulla Beach so it made for an interesting month gaining some more life experience there... it is fun, but hospitality is definately hard work! Not to mention requiring the balancing skills of a ninja. But the worst I have done (so far anyway :+) ) is drop two beers on this poor kid... luckily he and his faily say the funny side and thought it was hilarious... I promise - they even returned later that week... even if they did jokingly duck under the table when they saw me coming :+). I have met heaps of great people and really enjoyed the experience though.

It is like people watching, only you get to actually find out about their lives... so interesting. I have seen the nicest people in the world, the rudest people, and the sad day i had a lovely gentleman who had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I have also had a freshly released prisoner and (well, not) seen groups of people walk out without paying for their meals. crap hey. But you get them all and most people are just good value and enjoy a laugh which is always nice... not like those people who wont talk at all! i guess you learn about who you dont want to end up like that is for sure! :+)

Now I am getting psyched to move from the current heatwave to the coldest weather I can imagine. I cant wait. +)

 
Soup fruits and the art of chopstick mastery, Hong Kong- updated

2009-01-30 to 2009-02-02


Up early to complete one of the worst packing jobs ever attempted I was then somehow upgraded on the flight so that was a nice surprise - even if the rather portly guy next to me only decided to get up each time i was sleeping!!! Arriving in Hong Kong it was the best feeling in the world to be in a totally foreign country but know my way around, exactly where i was going and what i was doing!! Somehow I had even managed to find my Octopus card (public transport card) from my last trip and it was so seamless arriving again at Warrens in Sai Wan Ho... until I had to attempt to drag my bulging suitcase and backpack up the billion flights of stairs anyway!!

It was so good to see my super couchsurfing host from last visit, Kiwi Warren again and also meet another couchsurfer, Canadian Janine who became my partner in crime over the next fews day as we had a ball in the city.

Tired, we all managed to make it out for a local chinese dinner with another friend Kitty in Sai Wan Ho and for the first time in a while found it cold enough for a jumper!!! brr! winter! Back onto my favourite red couch it was time for another great nights sleep!

By the time we all managed to crawl out of bed we had missed breakfast menu`s but managed to find a bakery for some random breakfast food combinations. I did remember however how the bread here is so sweet! It is really odd to have a wholemeal bread tasting like cake... and most often you can never find it plain, but always with random surprise bits (of whoknows what!!) in it as well.

 

Janine and I caught the bus out to Causeway Bay to see the Harbour, Noonday gun left over from the British occupation and watched a trial medivac on the promenade. Walking through the open air markets we saw butchers butchering meat on the streets and still live seafood being prepared in front of our eyes. We were looking forward to seeing what the guide book proclaimed `times square` until we got there and found just another mall!

 

The trams in HK are tall and skinny and look comically like they will tip over at any minute, so we jumped on one for a super fun ride to Wan Chai. Everywhere we walked we found little orange trees covered in the good luck red money pockets for chinese new year and all so laden with fruit...so we tried them. And definately not recommended!!! So ridicuously sour - worse than a lemon or grapefruit....and also apparantly bringing us loads of bad luck for doing it...ooops!!!:+)

We began our adventure walking through Wan Chai and somehow found the back roads full of stairs to nowhere, sewerage pipes, rat poison and walked forever to attempt to find the Golden Bauhinia landmark.... jumping fences, and finally arrived to a very disappointing sight, but heaps of people taking photos!!!

Out to Wan Chai again we met all Warrens friends at Joe Bananas for the cheapest drinks is HK...I can highly recommend the french martini...whatever it is, it is good! And so began our amazing crazy evening at Karaoke, dusktilldawn and enjoying the HK spirit.

Finally after everyone attempting to get ready, several hours later we were all ready to head to the super mall food court for every food you can possibly think of. We also saw the random ice rink in the middle and had several bowls of mango deliciousness. I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is the greatest dessert ever!

Catching the MTR an off to the ferry for a day out at Lamma Island, arriving at Sok Kwu Wan Harbour to walk the awesome trail across the island to Yung Sue Wan, heading through tiny towns, cute restaurants, picturesque beaches and then one with a massive power station on it! so random! We brought random things, eating hung jue which turned out to be something you are supposed to make soup from, and random cotton flowers and white sour mangos....for future reference....gross!!

Arriving in Yung Sue Wan it turned out we had randomly picked the right harbour to end in where a friend Maria was to meet us! convenient! It was the most awesome beachside town with windy maze like streets, a brilliant vibe, cool little cafes and friendly people.

Dining beachside with Maria on traditional food was gorgeous before we all crashed out on the Island and I headed backon the ferry to watch the Chinese New Year Lion and Dragon Dance at the New World Centre, Kowloon.The guys in the costumes were so unbelieveably acrobatic, leaping on top of each other on thin tall posts and doing all sorts of tricks. It was absolutely amazing!!!

 

Again it was all too soon time to say goodbye to HK and head to the airport where I watched the cleaning ladies all pick up rubbish with regularkitchen tongs and clean the floors with tongs holding paper towels...so odd! there must have been a special on tongs this week!!!

 

Thailand here I come! :+) k xxx

 
Motorcycles, The River Kwai, Death Railway to Hellfire Pass and Ayutthaya, Thailand -UPDATEDMAY09!!!

2009-02-03 to 2009-02-06


I guess flying Air Srilanka I should have known I was to be in for an experience as I watched the plane shake so much on takeoff I thought the (nonworking) tv`s would fall on my head! At least there was food though even if the eating choices were chopsticks or fingers! Just as well I had perfected those skills in HK! :+)

 

Luckily I arrived in one piece into the hot hot hot hot!!!!! humidity of Bangkok and attempted to find my way to Paul`s house in Asok where I was to be couchsurfing... and sat there whilst the taxi drove around and around in circles!
 

Swasdee Kha! Hello in thai as I working up a nice sweat I tried my best to advise directions to Pauls` house. Paul had sent them through in Thai, however without access to a printer I had copied the english translation and just hoped for the best! Unfortunately as always happens, the best did not occur and after I saw the same sights pass by again I tried to ask the driver what was going on. Me with no thai, and him with very basic english I was still none the wiser so I mimed a telephone call and passed over Paul`s number. He definitely wasn`t too interested in calling for directions and we did another few loops before he caved! I finally convinced him to call Paul for directions and surprisingly enough we then arrived in no time!

 
Paul directed the driver in Thai to Sukhumvit 16, Klong Toey, his apartment in Bangkok and I was shown to the nice large futon i was to call home! Paul is a British teacher, working in Bangkok and was able to give me a few really good tips on where I should go.

 

As a result, bright and early the next morning Paul hailed me a motorbike taxi, explained where I was going and I hopped on the back for a lift to Si do, the southern bus terminal. That is certainly an amazing experience I will not forget, being on the back of a motorbike in the crazy choas of a thai morning rush hour, winding our way through traffic, between cars, buses and other bikes full of families, braking suddenly, speeding for gaps and joining the beeping horns everywhere. The trip was all too soon over as I hopped off when the nice driver stopped and gestured, only to find myself stuck in the middle of nowhere!!! Pacing up and down the street, geographically embarrassed,I finally found a gentleman in uniform and tried my best gesturing and map pointing. Alas it was not to be, until someone passing by heard me and came over speaking english. He pointed me in the direction of a concrete wall and advised me I needed to wait there to catch a bus for about another 10 mins to get to the bus terminal. I sat down as some locals climbed on precarious looking contraptions and cut down branches above my head and wondering how long it was before someone was hit!

 

Somehow I got on the bus and then off again at the bus terminal to buy a ticket on a bus to Kanchanaburi. I also managed to find an english speaker to write down in thai all the words for things i needed and spent the next half hour wandering around the shops holding my piece of paper up to everyone until I found the right shop assistant to help me. Highly entertaining for both of us!!

 

It was time to board my bus and out of all the mix of buses at the terminal, I had managed to buy a ticket on an old local bus. With a straight back forced upon me, I rattled my way several hours down the road to Kanchanaburi . Hitting up the tourist info at the terminal,I found the friendliest smiliest people in the world... who unfortunately spoke no english! They willingly handed over a map and I eagerly embarked on my walk to where I wanted to go... but hot and frustrated I headed back as it was not to scale and i couldnt figure anything out!! Luckily a new person had arrived who spoke english and I was given a new map and lots of helpful advice.

 

Walking down the road I was slowly melting and brain frying and out of water, I realised why no one else was walking and turned back to find a rickshaw (cycle taxi)! I arrived at the JEATH war museum (the name was derived from the countries that engaged in the Death Railway construction–Japan, England, America, Australia, Thailand and Holland. The small museum is a recreation of a thatched POW hut with photos and stories of life for them at the time.

 

I then caught an old traditional boat along the River Kwai to the bridge over the River Kwai, and walked over the bridge, reconstructed to resemble exactly the bridge that was built by Allied POWs during WWII. It is well known as part of the death railway linking Thailand and Myanmar (Burma). There was a wooden foot bridge constructed near by also, but this was damaged by Allied bombing and there is nothing left of it. The two arches that are different on the iron bridge were damaged by allied bombings and were later replaced with the different materials after the war.

 

Next to the bridge I walked through the WWII museum that has several levels full of lots of memorabilia, relics, photographs and recreations of the war, as well as random rooms with information on thingss uch as Miss Thailand! So far I was a little disappointed in both museums as i had not gotten a lot out of them. Heading outside I was trying to determine the best way to get to the Don Rak War cemetery at Kanchanaburi and found a little information stand. As I was standing there, another foreigner started talking to the guard and I, who was now a local in kanchanaburi and offered to drop meoff on the way through which was a much appreciated few minutes in aircon that`s for sure!

 

The Don Rak war cemetery is well maintained and a nice tribute for those who fought in the war. Across the road, the Thailand-Burma Railway Centre ( www.tbronline.com ) was by far the best museum there was. Showcasing the history of the death railway, beginning when the Japanese arrived in Thailand, through construction, prisoners lives, the bombings and the end of the war, it also had a significant focus on the Australians which was really interesting, as well as well presented and easy to follow, a nice change from the other two!

 

Walking through town to Sam`s guesthouse, the lovely owner (Sam :+) ) gave me a lift to his other hostel, Sam`s riverhouse as the rooms were cheaper there!how nice was that! I had a room to myself on a pontoon on the river kwai and sat on the little balcony outside, relaxing an watching the sunset over the river, what a tough life!!!! :+) before the mosquitoes came in full force and attacked like crazy!!

 

I met Bart, another traveller at the hostel and we jumped on his motorbike–a lot of people hire them to get around like a local- to head off to get some dinner at the night market. We wandered around the stalls, checking out all the fresh local foods before gorging on street octopus grilled in front of us and delicious fresh thai curries! So good!!!! mmmm mmm!

 

Wednesday dawned and the tour I had managed to book the day before arrived to pick me up with an awesome dutch couple. After an hour and a half we arrived at Erawan falls, which is named after the elephant god that the 7 th tier of the waterfall resembles. We walked for an hour, climbing up to all 7 tiers, being marveled at the gorgeous scenery and trying not to fall off the dodgy stairs and dodgy trails! highly entertaining!!! It was sooooo hot though! We were looking forward to jumping in, and picked the second tier as it was so pretty and we didnt have much to climb down once we had finished. We jumped in the crystal clear water and then realised that the monkeys had come down from the trees and were going through our bags!!! Luckily someone scared them off and they didnt managed to steal anything!!!dodgy monkeys!!!! It looked hilarious though as I was swimming, enjoying the gorgeous water and then looked up to see a monkey in my bag!! Once you decided to come in from the deeper water you had to contend with the hundreds of fish that were also in the water. It was quite entertaining to be swimming with them... until you stopped moving and they started to nibble on you!!! I know people pay good money for this new age type of treatment,but it just feels so weird!!! I had to constantly keep moving so they would stop nibbling on me!!!!! SO weird!!!

 

It certainly felt like I was back on the tourist trail again though as I bumped into people I had spoken to randomly in various museums the day before! small small world on the tourist trail!

 

The heat quickly dried us off and we headed to a local shop for a delicious thai cuisine lunch sitting outside, enjoying the peacefulness of Erawan National Park.

 

Arriving at our next stop, Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum , we were required to take our shoes off before entering. This museum is supported by the Australian Government due to the massive involvement the Australian POWs had here. Hell Fire Pass is a 4km part of the death railway from Thailand to Burma for the Japanese to get supplies. Thousands of Allied POWs and local labour died ( over 100 000,including approx 90 000 locals). The pass is in thick forest and cut through a mountain, 500m long and 26m deep, and was constructed using hand drills, picks, shovels, baskets and dynamite and completed in 6 weeks. It is so named because it was like hell working on it, and during the `speedo` (fast) period they had to work 24 hours a day and it was lit by fire, hence hell fire. So basically it took about 3 months, which is the most time consuming of any part of the railway as the prisoners chipped and blasted the rock to build the railway line through the mountain. It was totally unbelievable to stand there and imagine how it was possibly done. It was so hot and so hard for us walking through and we weren`t even being forced to work 24 hours a day with no proper tools,food or water. It is said each sleeper is equal to the loss of life of one prisoner.

 

The museum provides an audio that you can wear whilst walking the pass which was really interesting and moving to hear all the little stories from the time. There is also a plaque to commemorate Weary Dunlop on the wall here who helped so many of the POWs with his medical skills. He asked that when he died his ashes were to be scattered here with his mates which was so unbelievably moving.

 

We then rode to the station to ride the train along the death railway. Walking along the tracks, precariously balanced on the side of the mountain, far above the river kwai, the actual tracks built by the POWs are still here and intact, with the total original construction. It was scary enough walking along the track,let alone having to build it into the side of the mountain. We could also walk inside a large cave in the side of the mountain that was used as a hospital during the railway construction.

 

We jumped onto the packed train (it is a regular public transport route used by the thai people nowdays) and held on for dear life with one small chain holding us in over the wide open doorways. Totally scary!

 

As the bus dropped me off in Kanchanaburi and i located a minibus to take me back to Bangkok, I reflected on what an absolutely amazing experience I had and that I was just so glad I made the trip out of bangkok to see the area!!

 

Arriving in Bangkok almost 2 hours later I walked down Khao San Rd, which is THE main street of Bangkok. It is alive with the most amazing atmosphere, people everywhere, street vendors with fresh food, drinks, market stalls and you name it! I passed people selling cockroaches, grubs and grasshoppers to eat and all kinds of other goodies, as well as people offering to print up `genuine` degrees/ diplomas/ IDs and all kinds of other important documentation made right in front of you! And little bars proudly declaring `we do not check Ids!`. Definitely The most amazing road to experience!!!

 

Grabbing a tuk-tuk (a little kind of enclosed 3 wheel motorised taxi) home we got lost again! The driver randomly dropped me off, so it was just as well I was getting quite good at figuring out where I was and could walk home from the spot! Paul arrived home and we jumped onto his bike to head into town with his mates for the night. We ended up at this great place where it was retro night and all kinds of crazy outfits were out. In Thailand you also just buy the entire bottle of alcohol at the bar and just buy mixers separately and make your own drinks there! If you dont drink the entire bottle, you can leave it there and continue on next time you return! nice hey! We tried out dodgy street kebabs on the way home too, which were great!

 

I was really starting to enjoy riding on the back of motorbikes in Bangkok as Paul dropped me off at the sky train on his way to work. My pan was to head to a place Paul had recommended to me– Ayuthia (said ae-ith i-a) which is the capital of the old Kingdom or Siam and a UNESCO world heritage site.

 

Following directions from local Paul, I got off the sky train in town and randomly walked around the Victory Monument saying `Ayuthia! Ayuthia!` to all the mini vans until someone said `yes!` and i just jumped on in! So Paul was right in the best way to get there! It did take a fair while to find one though!!! Luckily the people are all so friendly and helpful that you can get by without Thai. Even if they dont speak a word of english either they are always happy to help!!

 

Arriving in Ayuthia I was absolutely dumbfounded to see all the massive old temples and ruins just sitting by the side of the road everywhere. Unbelievable! Tossing up between taking a bike or an elephant, I took an elephant ride tour around the town! pretty cool hey! I then walked to the Ancient Royal Palace where I was interview by some local Thai schoolgirls for their english class which was good fun and then i wandered around the site, absolutely amazed!! This is one of the most commonly photographed sites with the 3 large spires grandly standing above the rest of the site.

 

Wanting to see so many more sites and absolutely melting in the crazy crazy heat, I paid a helpful tuk tuk driver to take me to a few more out of the way and so he could practice his english! I asked him to recommend as there were so many you could see and I visited Wat Chaiwatthanaram, which was totally amazing. It is built beside the river and reminded me of photos of Angkor Wat in Cambodia the way it was built. Icould have wandered around here for hours it was so amazing, but I wanted to see more!! We then drove to the massive massive lying down buddha who i cant remember what it was called!! And then out of town a bit onto the  Wat Yai Chaya Mongkol which was really spectacular with all the Buddhas dressed up in bright yellow material.

 

Unfortunately it was all too soon time to get on the road again. I bid farewell to my tuk tuk driver and randomly stumbled across the mini bus site for return to Bangkok. I returned to the victory monument and wandered around trying to find my way backup to the sky train! Buying a chicken curry from a street vendor for dinner, I was looking forward to an authentic thai curry, but I definitely got more than I bargained for with the definite local flavour to the cooking as the `chicken` was chicken feet, guts and who knows what!! not so hungry all of the sudden!!

 

I chilled at home with Paul, and contemplated thailand. friendly helpful people, crazy crazy traffic everywhere, all the time, a massive obsession with the royal family–the kings picture is everywhere!! on billboards,on massive paintings, in pictures and in shrines in each different city! full on!! And the strangest one of all.... a corn obsession! yes,as in sweet corn, from the cob!! These chunks are placed in everything, from bread, to sweets, to yoghurt, to icecream! crazy! I thought it sounded intriguing so tried some corn yoghurt. Definitely not something I ever want to eat again that is for sure!!!!! ever!!

 

Time again to before bid farewell and hitting the airport where some kind of major local celebrity ( who i had no idea who he was!)was being stalked by about a thousand teenage girls!! it took me a while to get through,but i made it, embarking on my travel from extreme heat to the extreme cold of an english winter! wish me luck!!

 
Welcome to London, where the temperature is -2 and snowing.

2009-02-06 to 2009-02-17






Arriving into London at 6am I was shattered after spending the flight being woken by the ever helpful older lady next to me each time the drinks tray went by in case i had changed my mind about wanting one! And the temperature -2 and snowing!!! Welcome to London :+) Pretty cool I thought, but everyone else just thought it was a hassle! It was actually really quite painless arriving, heading straight downstairs to the tube, then bus and arriving several hours later at my school friend Mabel`s house who had kindly offered to let me stay and help me set myself up... but boy was it sooooooooo cold!! We somehow managed to drag my suitcase up about 4 flights of stairs to her room and then fell about exhausted! After laying down on my bed 6 hours magically passed and it was time to spend about 20 mins layering up ready to head outside and meet up with some of Mabel`s friends in Angel.

 

Another grey London day dawned and we forced ourselves out of bed to layer up again and head into Borough Market which was a fantastic selection of all kinds of awesome fresh foods you can try and buy. The hot mulled apple drink there was probably the nicest drink I have had!So delicious...and warm!!!!:+) Walking through Piccadilly to Oxford and Regent streets it was like we were trapped in a monopoly board ...and having a great time!

 

Watching the rain drizzle down, Spitalfields Markets was our next adventure braving the weather to wander around and through to the Sunday up market which was full of treasures and a big multicultural food area with heaps of awesome foods. We walked through Brick lane, where every shop is an Indian restaurant and had to duck in and out of stores pretending to be interested in the merchandise just so we could defrost for a bit!!!

 

Beginning to sort out my life I headed into Angel to check out the area, check out all the op shops that are everywhere and sort out bank accounts and a phone. It was so easy for me having Mabel to show me what and where everything was, how things were done and what I actually needed to do. Thank you so much Mabel, it would have not been anywhere near as easy or nice arriving here without you!!!! xxxxxx

 

The next morning it was time to drag my life onto the bus, tube (again cursing the fact there was no lifts or escalators!!!) and bus to arrive at my new home and job, at The Orange Tree in Totteridge! ( www.theorangetreetotteridge.co.uk )

 

I met the staff and was shown to my bed, living upstairs in the pub with about 8 other internationals (2 to a room) who also all work at the pub in varying positions. I then spent the next few hours cleaning and was satisfied I wasn`t about to catch anything! The pub is all refurbished downstairs, but upstairs it is still all really really old and so cold!!! I fashioned myself a shelf out of old bits of broken furniture and headed the few km`s to check out `town`, the main road of Whetstone, High Rd... actually the main street of every town is called `high Rd` so it makes it easy to figure out!! There is a couple of smallish expensive supermarket, a few misc shops, banks, op shops, cafe`s, hairdressers and a post office. I managed to get my bank account open which was great, even if I did watch the sun setting out the window at like 4pm!!!! and also see so many HUGE houses. The area here is really well off and the houses are mansions, with massive massive grounds and some even with gatekeepers and everything. There are famous people, royalty and lots of people with a lot of money... definitely a case of seeing how the other half live! Amazing! And there I am living in Totterige village amongst them all.... even if it is a share room in the top of a pub!:+) So chilly though!! I am hoping it doesn`t take too long to get used to as I layered up all my clothes inside my room ready for bed.

 

Still struggling with jet lag, random sleep patterns and no sunshine, I woke up early to go for a run around the local area and discovered miles and miles of walking tracks through parks, farming areas and lots of countryside which was really cool. It was so cold though that the ground was all frozen, as with the puddles and even the mud.... but not strong enough to hold my weight though as my feet plunged into the icy mud and water below!!! I did come across a massive pond that was totally frozen over and felt sorry for the poor ducks standing in the middle just looking seriously confused!!! It was a little bit of a problem figuring out where I was though, but luckily managed to back track and arrive back home... even if it did take several hours!!

 

Then it was time to begin work! I had been given lots of paperwork the day before and it was a bit of initiation by fire straight into the job without really knowing how the restaurant and bar worked, the customers, computer system or the menus!! And it was so busy too!! I began my first double shift, midday to midnight/1am which I am to become well acquainted with as the roster (or rota as they randomly call it) gives them every day!!! :+) We do get an hour or so for dinner though (where we can also buy a staff lunch for 3 quid) so we can survive :+)

 

I had the next morning off so walked a track for several km`s into High Barnet, the Borough (council) we are part of in Totteridge. It was a cool little town, bigger than Whetstone and with a lot more shops and things which was cool. I then caught a bus to North Finchley, the next town in the opposite direction and was totally amazed as the snow began to drop around me and continue for the next few hours. Everyone else was scurrying away but I just kept walking around, It was so amazing!!!!!!!

 

I am beginning to get the hang of everything at work and even get into the totally nocturnal life.... kind of anyway! It turns out we set tables to the right here though! And it also amazes me how many people eat dessert, or `pudding`... every single table looks at the menu and it would be very rare to find a table not having sweets. And no, no one is fat either! The customers are mostly all really quite nice which is the best part of the job talking to them... but closing down at night and polishing all the hundreds of menu`s, cutlery and wine glasses certainly isn`t!

 

We get a pretty average wage too...5.73 an hour, but most people do leave extra for service so it makes it a bit easier to live off!

 

The washing machine and dryer at the pub are used for washing all the work tea towels etc as well as all our washing so there is a lot of use on them... unfortunately the dryer broke this week as well so we are all forced to hang our clothes on the radiators, off the lights and everywhere we can to dry them...everywhere you look in the rooms there are clothes that take like 3 days to dry it is so cold and damp!!!! so funny!

 

The supermarket in downtown Whetstone is quite expensive so Peter, one of the assistant managers has a car and drives about 2omins out to a cheaper, but really good supermarket chain called Tesco`s. It is massive!! Even bigger than the American Walmarts! Split over 2 levels it is like a Coles, plus Woolworths, plus Big W, Kmart, Target and a little bit of Myer all together!!!! amazing!!! And it is 24 hours so we arrived at about half past 1 in the morning and spent the next hour shopping! and people do it on a regular basis. totally crazy!!!

 

Unfortunately there is no internet at the pub or even anything very local so have to try and get into town and update on my days off... so sorry for being slack with updating and emails/FB etc.. i am working on my best plan of attack!!! k xxx

 
Life in England :+) Updated

2009-02-17 to 2009-03-16


A week and a day after arrival I received my first day off... and boy was I tired!!! It was a great day though, walking through town and joining up for the free National Health Service at the local doctors, so painless and easy!!! and then heading out with one of the guys from work, Peter, to Alexandria Palace (or Ally Pally as the local call it) which has views of the entirety of London. We fed the crazy starved ducks in the park and then headed inside to go ice skating!! It was great fun and not nearly as painful as anticipated!!! We then found a really cheap flight to Milan on the internet and so booked 3 of us from work London-Milan for 20 quid return... yep, that is the total for all of us!! So cheap!! To put it into perspective a tank of petrol is 50!! Soooooooo we are off to Milan for the day in March!!! woohoo!!

 

I am still enjoying working here, I have recently also been put onto bar shifts so I now alternate when we are short bar staff as opposed to the floor (waitressing) staff. It definitely took a while to get used to the drinks but i now have it more or less sussed and can pull a pint with the best of them :+). I don`t really like it when it is super busy though and there are people lining up three deep to get service, clicking their fingers and watching your every move...give me floor any day when it is busy!!

 

One thing that makes me laugh though is the fact that whoever designed this place clearly never has worked in hospitality before... all the bar tables and bar (not the top, but the entire rest of it;; and the mirrors are all brass and all need to be polished either every night (for the tables) or every week for the rest!! What a joke!!! It takes hoooooooooooooours!! And not fun at all!!!! That designer must just be sitting at home laughing!!

 

I had a customer in the other day that was really rude, complained about everything and ended up getting free desserts. She then booked a table to come back as she left so I know she was only doing it to get free stuff!! She then rang up and accused me of stealing her scarf!! Apparently i took it upstairs with her coat... which i didnt–the manager took her coat and there was no scarf and when this was pointed out she said she had left it on the table and i took it when i cleared it and a thousand other different stories... she rang back twice that day and the next few days as well to complain!! She then came back the next week and tried the same thing again!!!! so rude!! We were talking about it later and the boss said he only wished we had found the scarf and one of us was wearing it :+).

 

Last night I also had someone complain that the mushrooms on his dish were off. I took them back to the kitchen to the chef who was like `they are fresh today`!!!! and then shoved one in my mouth for me to test... luckily they weren`t.:+) however I have decided to go to a different chef in future in case the food actually is off i don`t want to be the guinea pig!!!

 

Instead of having little comment cards we hand out business card called `Empathica` with an online survey on it for the customers to complete. We have a competition where the staff member who gets named, has the most positive mentions and comments for the month wins a free dinner for 2 at one of our sister sites (which has the benefit of us being able to test all the food, drinks, service etc as we are all part of the one chain) and also the pub has a quota of feedback and percentages each month we have to get to keep head office happy. So I also just found out last week that I won for last month which was a nice surprise and it was nice to read all the comments people wrote as they were just so lovely and it really motivates you to do your job when you know you can have that effect on people that they were so happy they decided to take time out of their day to write in about their service... Especially when you work 12 hour days, run around like crazy people and clearly spend the remainder of your time stealing scarves... :+). I now i have to find time to have my free dinner!!!! woohoo!

 

The pub also got a new menu this month so we all got up early one morning and headed downstairs to have a tasting off all the new dishes so we could see how they are prepared, presented and taste so we can recommend properly. It was so good! Although a trifle odd at eating steak, duck, salmon and you name it first thing in the morning, but delicious. The food here is definitely really good... well except for the calves liver. I thought i was going to throw up when i tasted it. Oh my gosh. SO disgusting.

 

Unfortunately working long hours, not getting enough sleep, even with ear plugs!!! starts to run you down so it was really no surprise we all started to get colds which laid us low for a week... then for me 2 weeks until i managed to get in to see the free national doctor (I was not about to pay for travel insurance for this entire trip!!!) and got drugs to treat my bronchitis. Those few weeks are a bit of a blur. I didnt do anything but work, eat and sleep and i dont actually remember too much. It is only this week again that I am actually feeling myself!! finally! Crappy english weather :+)

 

I have also decided hospitality staff must be the only people in the entire country who actually hope for crappy weather! Every day it is sunny the entire population decides that it is a good idea to head down to their local and we are absolutely run off our feet! When I first arrived I looked forward to seeing the sunshine... now we all wake up and curse when we see it as we know we will be smashed!!!

 

It hasnt been all work and no play though! I have met Mabel a few times in various places around London–Covent Garden, Oxford St, Camden Town, Regents Park and also been out in Camden town with the guys from work. I have caught up with Toby and Ash, Aussie friends I did volunteer work with in Peru a few times and have been to an awesome Mexican fiesta at their place... mmm Mexican food!

 

Since I have been here I have also been offered a job working in a beach bar in Marbella in the south of Spain, and also with a logistics company in the south of england. It has taken me a while to kind of decide what i am doing, whether to go for one of these, stay here in london, go back to summer camp in the US, or go somewhere new like Scotland or Ireland. But I think I have finally made up my mind and decided to return to summer camp in the USA as I think i will regret it if i dont as i had such an amazing time there last year, it is definitely the dream job - you wake up every morning gladto be there and it is rare you can say that about anything hey! it also definitely had a positive influence on me as well and I believe changed me for the better as a person. And the kids! It is also nice to be such an important role model in their lives and seeing facebook messages asking me if i was going back it would kill me not to i think! It was a hard decision as i wasnt sure if it was time for a new adventure as camp was something i had already done and it will definitely be different without the same staff team who i loved, but it will still be great. So it looks like America here i come in June. After that... homeless and jobless once again!:+)

The clotted cream obsession, England

2009-03-20 to 2009-04-15


Yes, I dont understand it, but somehow, for some bizarre reason; everyone in england loves clotted cream. What is it anyway? It just looks like fat with chunks of hard yellow dried fat on top??? But it is everywhere... clotted cream on every cake and dessert, on biscuits, in tins and fresh in the supermarket, in packaged puddings and mixed in icecream and you name it!!!! Everywhere..... Dis-gust-ing!!!

Now my little rant is over I unfortunately have misplaced my thumb drive with my blogs!! i know!! I am so useless!! So i now need to buy one and upload again so i can update my writing!! (i know Bern... finally!!!!!

It has been a little crazy... I worked almost 65 hours last week so havn`t had much time to do anything but work and sleep, but I have booked a tour to the western front for ANZAC day I am looking forward to and also caught up with a few friends in london which has been great.

I also managed to get up at 0645... yes, in the morning which is quite a challenge when youwork untik after 1am each night! To get into London to meet Mabel on the set of an MTV (Music TV) video clip we were to be in the filming of. We ended up spending 8 hours there (yup, a 3 minute song!!!) and my god it was tiring. We started dancing normally as one would but were told.... more arms!!!, more enthusiasm!!!, more movement!!! MORE ARMS!!!!!!, more jumping!! go go go!!! So we must have looked like total tools cause we certainly felt like it!! It was soooooo hot as well we were all dripping with sweat and it was hilarious as we are all going crazy dancing like madmen and then they yell cut and we all just stop and feel like we are going to fall over and die. So in an instant it must look like we go from having the most fun ever in our lives to nothing as soon as the camera stops. SO funny!!!! It was suposed to be over by lunch, but ran well behind time and we were asked to come to the second location for some selective filming and we were like `sorry we are busy!!!!` it was highly entertaining though and i am glad i experienced it, and now i have a story for the grandkinds....but never ever again!!! Northern Allstars `Rock the dancefloor` look out for it :+)

I will try and update soon... i know i have said that a lot but i will try, i promise!! thanks for all the messages!!! k xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 

 

 
Aussie Day out in London - finally uploaded :+)

2009-04-16 to 2009-04-24

After slogging away for about 60 hour weeks we were all tired and in need of a day out!! The 4 Aussies at work at that stage, Andy, Ben, Tash and I convinced our boss to bring in reinforcements so we could hit the city! Unfortunately as only England can, the day dawned grey, cold and miserable as we awoke early (yes, this is actually quite difficult when you require to live a nocturnal life!!) to head into our local High Rd (main st of town) in Whetstone for a massive brekky to start the day. Jumping on the tube we somehow managed to successfully change a few lines onto the overland train to arrive in Greenwich and randomly follow the streets to Greenwich Park where we chased squirrels and climbed the hill to the Royal Observatory - longitude 0`0`00, the Prime Meridian of the world. All time on earth is measured relative to Longitude 0`, which is defined by the crosshairs of the great transit circle telescope in the Meridian buildings of the Royal Observatory. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is also the basis for the International Time Zone System. We stood on the line depicting the Meridian... along with the other billion people! And then toured the Museum of time and astronomy. Walking to Greenwich Pier we came across a sign pointing us to the `Queens House` which looked quite odd. Turns out it was built for Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I in 1638... older than modern day Australia! Boarding a ferry to cruise up the River Thames we watched the scenery change to the familiar British landmarks of the London and Tower Bridges, The Tower of London, The London Eye, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament before we were glad to escape the cold and wind off the ferry! We walked past Westminster Abbey, The Horse Guards and St James Park which was full of gorgeous tulips. As we headed down Regent street to Piccadilly Circus we were bailed up by people trying to get customers into their new restaurant and so gave it a shot and ended up in a space the size of a shoebox but the food was nice and cheap! The Walkabout is a well known Australian pun chain here so we headed off to spend sometime comparing pubs in the traditional english past time! We found this really cool pub in the end near Leicester Square called Waxy`s little sister with 2 levels and a dumb waiter between them where you could send your drink order down and have it sent up to you so you never had to leave the warm fire!! so good! Back through Leicester Square we found this amazing frozen yoghurt place with so many different types of freshly made frozen yoghurt it was a-mazing!! So we spent some quality time there :+). Most of the others had gone through an organisation in Australia to set up their bank accounts etc here and had been provided with a guide to living in London. And it is so funny!! It talks about how when you are on the tube, you cannot smile or talk to other travelers and do not under any circumstances make eye contact and various other pieces of advice... and sitting on the tube it is so true! Nobody talks or smiles!! So we spent the entire time trying to look equally as grumpy and serious and annoyed at the world by ourselves. It is ridiculous! We gave up and just acted normally and watched everyone stare at us or ignore us (whilst avoiding eye contact of course!!!). So ridiculous!! It is the funniest guide ever! We jumped off in Camden to enjoy some more music at another cool pub Ben had found before arriving back at the Orange Tree, refreshed from our one day off for the week and ready to start work all over again the next morning!
 
The Last Post on dawn at Villers-Bret, ANZAC Day 2009

2009-04-24 to 2009-04-28


 Less than half an hour after leaving home in Totteridge, I (loving English public transport) arrived at St Pancras Station, Kings Cross ready to meet the Topdeck representative for my ANZAC Day Western Front tour. And i looked and looked and looked!

It was already quarter past 4, 15 mins after the meeting time and there was no one there... Several laps of the station later, I spoke to another tour group representative who was super organized and put ours to shame... apparently ours was missing in action so he pointed me in the direction of all the other lost souls he had put together in Topdecks absence. Our itinerary had indicated we needed to enter the Eurostar immigration by half past and at 20 past there was still no sign of her. Ringing the Topdeck office I was told that the guide`s phone was off so she was still on the tube... or so Topdeck hoped! 40 mins late she arrived and said she was waiting at the other ticket office.... liar! Then asked where she was supposed to be taking us and had no idea where we were going... even after we had explained!!! Nice! We entered immigration and made it with minutes to spare! ....Turns out Topdeck is run by Flight Centre! I should have known after my past experiences with Flight Centre!!   

Our tour group was 12 Aussies, 1 kiwi and 1 Irish and a really good group, we chatted on the tour or so train ride to Lille ,(lil) France before meeting our new tour guide, a pom called Mark...luckily the other random chick was just to drop us off and we all breathed a sigh of relief! Mark was great and had a massive interest and knowledge in military history which he began to share with us on our about hour long drive to Amien (said amion). Arriving at Hotel Kyriad he confirmed that we had eaten dinner and had food for breakfast.... but surprisingly enough it had not been passed on from the last guide! We all piled back into our van to do laps of Amien until we found somewhere to eat! It turned out to be a dodgy kebab store that was the only thing open at 10pm on a Friday night. With us no French and them no English we used the universal signage of pointing which took them about an hour to make us about 8 kebabs!! I got a toasted lettuce kebab...welcome to France!! 

After about just 4 hours sleep it was a nasty shock to hear the alarm at 3am for the dawn service. We piled into the van and drove down the road to Villers-Bretonneux. Parking on the side of the road we walked up the hill in the pitch black pre dawn Australian Memorial where we listened to the bagpipes play and we lucky enough to get seats right near the front where we could watch the ceremony. We watched the bright stars and tried not to concentrate on how bitterly cold and windy it was, even wrapped in thermals, down jackets and sleeping bags, although it did put it into perspective for us for the troops who had attacked there on ANZAC Day 1918. The date was so bizarre, having the Australian troops attack exactly 3 years to the date of Gallipoli. It is only the second year that there has been a large service at Villers-Brett and there were about 3000 people there. It was really well organised and conducted which was really nice, the the speeches really interesting as we heard that both Ned Kelly`s Nephew and a relative of the policeman that captured the gang fought side to side. It was hard to concentrate on the French National Anthem though as once it started playing I found it is the tune for the Brisbane Lions AFL song.... so upbeat and chirpy! 

It was really eiree listening to the dead silence and watching the bugler play the last post from the top of the memorial tower as dawn broke over the old battlefields. Definitely something that I will remember. Very amazing. 

Walking around the memorial and cemetery after the service somehow I randomly ran into Val, a friend from East Timor who is currently living in England... what are the chances?!! 

I also got a text from Mum when I was there that she saw me on the ABCs live coverage of the service which was pretty cool too! 

We jumped back into our van and headed to Sailly- Le- Sec to see the 3 rd Australian Division Memorial, one of five Australian Division Memorials, each situated on an area that is significant in that Divisions battle honours. Driving to Albert we arrived at the church with the golden virgin on top. It was said that if the golden virgin ever fell the war would be over. This did fall during fighting in 1918 and several months later the war did end.... The area in which we were travelling is full of tiny country towns so it took us a while to find somewhere that was open that could seat the 15 of us to eat! And when we did, In true French fashion it was croissants for breakfast. 

The Somme battlefields are situated in the region of North Western France through which the Somme river runs. There are so many battlefields throughout the area and so we began on our journey to visit the most significant Australian sites here.  Pozieres is where the 1st/2nd/4 th Australian Divisions sought to capture the high ground for the Allied Advance against the German 2 nd line defence in highly defended positions.

CAPT Albert Jacka who some may remember from his actions as a LCPL in Gallipoli where he won a VC won his first of two MCs during WW2 here. There were about 23000 causalities at Pozieres in 6 weeks. The town was captured, but totally flattened and the troops suffered significant losses. The Australians fought here from 23 July 1916 to the end of August where they were retired and sent to the North to regroup for their next action.

The 1 st Australian Division memorial is located in Pozieres. It has a lookout just beside it and it is amazing to look out across the landscape and see how ridiculously flat the entire area was, and wonder how on earth the flighting was sustained. During 1916 there was a Windmill at Pozieres, which was significant as it was situated on the top of a small ridge which from where could be seen across a large part of the battlefield. The exact site remains and is now a memorial to the Australians who lost their lives. The plaque reads `The ruin of the Pozieres Windmill which lies here was the centre of the struggle in this part of the Somme battlefield in July and August 1916. It was captured on August 4 th by Australian Troops who fell more thickly on this ridge than on any other battlefield of this war.` 

The NZ Memorial at Longuval was our next stop to signify where NZ forces played a massive part in the conclusion to the battle of Somme in Sep 1916. This one had engraved on it&quot;from the utmost ends of the earth&quot;which is really kind of moving when you think about how they were all brought from so far away to effectively fight someone elses war.  The NZ government decided not to combine the names of their missing onto large memorials as the AS and British did, and so NZ has small memorials dotted around the battlefields near where the troops are believed to have gone missing.

The Caterpillar Cemetery housed one of these NZ memorials to the missing which was our next stop. A bit of a drive onto Beaumont-Hamel was next, where a Newfoundland Memorial Park preserves a large portion of the battlefields in this area.

 http://digital.realviewtechnologies.com/?xml=defencenews_army.xml is a story on fromelles.

an aussie actually shot Hitler. The scary thing was, that the bullet was a matter cm`s away from possibly killing him. To think that World War II may have never happened!

.ExternalClass .EC_hmmessage P{padding:0px;}.ExternalClass body.EC_hmmessage{font-size:10pt;font-family:Verdana;}doing a little reading up on Fromelles and found some stuff I thought you might all find interesting (if not already known). Firstly as we all know many soldiers were gunned down in no-mans land, however I found that about 200 or so Australians actually made it past the first line of German defense with much hand to hand combat. They then reached there second line of defense where a big German pill box was smashing them with machine guns. Sources say that quite a few `Aussies` actually got right up to the german pill box and even touched it, but were killed before they could get inside. For the most interesting fact was that inside that German pill box was a young Austrian runner by the name of Adolf Hitler. You can only imagine what might have happened if some of those `Aussies` had got into that box, how different history could have been!

 
Finishing work at the Orange Tree and my final jouney through England... for now! UPDATED

2009-04-29 to 2009-05-16


My MTV video is also out...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBpaKUIPSyA Northern Allstars -Rock the Dancefloor. I am trying to upload it, but so far without success! Check me out at 2.41-43, 2.17, 2.27 and 2.55 - dont blink or you will miss my miliseconds of fame after the 8 hours it took to shoot :+)

Time has totally flown since I returned from the Western Front, so I am unbelieveably glad that i managed to write down what I was doing in my diary, or I would have absolutely nothing to say as it feels like work, work, work and nothing else!

We had the first UK recorded case of bird flu in my Borough, (like a Shire :+) ) so we have all been avoiding like mad anyone who is unlucky enough to have a cough or sneeze anywhere near us! Swine flu!!!

It had been really really busy at work with the sunshine making more and more of an appearance and the entire population deciding that it means they should head to the pub! I had a few crazy days - one where a couple came in with the guys parents without booking a table, tried to get into the restaurant on a Sunday (near impossible!) and then after I had cleared their plates asked me to wipe their table and bring over dessert menu... so i did, only to barge in on him asking his girlfriend to marry him&gt;SO weird. Why would you bring your parents to a pub, where you hadnt booked a table, and ask for something from the waitress and then not even wait to ask? Bizarre family. I dont think they even spoke to each other the entire time... and she wasnt even wearing the ring when she left. Odd odd people!!

We also had a really funny day when the roof started leaking, just a few drops and then a waterfall all over some customers heads!!!! Turns out it was raw sewerage from the upstairs toilet in our accomodation drain flooding. The entire restaurant smelt like raw sewerage and the buckets we put to catch it you could clearly see the yellow colour. So disgusting!!! Our cover story was that it was the washing machine.. i doubt anyone bought it!!! We all spent the entire day laughing as it smelt so bad we couldn`t deal with it!!! And not only that, but then we had to bail out the upstiars shower as it flooded out of the drain too!!! yes, truly gross! Because it was the long weekend we couldnt get anyone to come out for 2 days either. Sooooooooooooo gross!!!!!!! But somewhat hilarious too :+)

Somehow in my limited time at the pub I became the staff trainer and as all the new people came in it was my job to have them shadow me for a few days whilst I taught them what they needed to do. It was quite fun really and quite satisfying once they ended up with an entire section on their own and doing really well.

As I was returning from the supermarket in town one day I couldnt be bothered to walk adn decided to wait for the bus. I waited and waited as 3 buses just kept on driving without stopping. There is supposed to be a bus about every 12-15 minutes, but i waited 45 and nothing!!! A bus finally came and stopped and it was like it was hijacked! We flew off from the bus stop at breakneck speed, speeding down the road, around the corners and driving past people waiting at the stops. People tried to press the buzzer to be let off, but we just kept driving, so people started to panic and scream and hit the buzzer constantly and nothing happened. It was so weird!!! It was like out of some crazy action movie. A guy ended up storming down the bus and havign it out with the driver who pulled the bus to a screeching halt at the side of the road and we all quickly jumped off, glad to have escaped with our lives!!!! I had to laugh though, for not wanting to walk from town to the pub, I had ended up further away in the opposite direction as a result, and almost been in a high speed bus crash! nice hey!!!

On my (rare!) days off I managed to get into town and see Covent Garden and find this awesome muffin shop that had the most delicious muffins that were everything you could want, fat free, sugar free, gluten free, dairy free... you name it, they had it!! I considered sending you a dozen bern, but decided the postie might eat them on the way they smelt so delicious!

I also headed over to Hampsted Heath ( www.capitalgardens.co.uk ) , which is a massive, massive park (320 hectares)a few tube stops away that has massive swimming ponds (lots too - so 1800`s!! - some for men, some for women, some for mixed bathing!!), fishing ponds, bike tracks, flowers, animal enclosures, everything you could want... and it was gorgeous! It also is home to Kenwood House, a gorgeous mansion remodelled in the 1760`s with beautiful rooms (unfortunately no photos allowed!) and equally stunning gardens. It hs been used in several movies, most notably Notting Hill and some Jane Austen adaptations i believe. It also has a massvie collection of paintings by so many famous artists throughout.

Quite by accident looking for lunch one day, I ended up at Notting Hill tube stop one day and found the Portobello Markets, which you can find anything at! And all sorts of delicious fresh foods! so good! I then headed with Jarrad, and another friend Jess up to the Vertigo Bar at Tower 42 which has stunning views of London where we watched the sunset over the city. Ahhhh so pretty :+) After such a great day I decided to buy a ticket in the Euromillions jackpot, thinking for sure I would win. Unfortunately ti was not to be this time!!!

And so, after seeing a few great sights in the city, I ended my last day at work at the Orange Tree. I had become quite close to everyone there so it was sad to be leaving my little family, but boy was i looking forward to my new job ( see the next blog for details!!!) and not being super shattered after working 60 hours a week on my feet!

I had already arranged to see an aussie friend from East Timor, Val and her husband Greg and luckily I was still able to fit it in. They are living at Shrivenham, and as I caught the tube out to the bus I randomly ran into my friend Regan from ADFA on the tube station. SO random! I never normally catch that line and it was jam packed in peak hour, but i look up and there he is right next to me!!! small world! I then caught the megabus - an awesome bus company that you can get tickets all over the UK with for£1 and headed off to Swindon to meet Val.

Up bright and early we drove to Bath ( www.bathandbeyond.org ) and jumped on the park and ride into the city centre. It is a gorgeous old Roman Town and heritage listed so it remains very well looked after. All the buildings are also made from the bath stone which looks really cool. It gets dirty though and turns black from the pollution so it has to be washed like every year!!! The city has volunteers that put on free walking tours so we learnt all about the city from this fantastic guide. It was such an intersting place in 18th England and all the wealthy holidayed here in the spring and activities were put on for them each day by the town. A lot of people also came here to find husbands! We saw places where Jane Austen set her books (she used to live in Bath) and the paths along which her characters, and indeed all personnel in 18th England promenaded. We also learnt that if you say `Mary Anne` it means a mess! As it, `it was a right Mary Anne`! Meaning `a right mess`!

I then toured the Roman Baths ( www.romanbaths.co.uk ) which still have hot bubbling spring water coming into them and are so well preserved. It is hard to believe people bathed here 2000 years ago!It was amazing how they had amanged to figure out how everything once was from the rubble and put it back together. They have a museum with interesting artefacts that they have found over the years from the Roman period, including curses that the locals at the time wrote on sheet metal, folded up and threw into the thermal waters for the gods to grant! You could also drink the water, guarantted to either kill you, or cure you! Luckily for me i dont think it did anything!! It tasted fairly gross though, warm sulpher. mmm mmm!

We walked around the Royal Cresent that had an 18th century period museum where we learnt about how dogs were used to run in little wheels in the kitchen to turn the spit to cook the meat. Check out my pics!! so cool! We also saw the old sedan coaches that people used to be carried about in... apparntly where the word Sedan used for cars came from...?! We also walked through the ircus, a full on circle row of houses where Nicholas Cage, the American Movie Star currently lives.

That night we walked down to the local pub on the high street, that consisted of about 10 stores and had dinner and joined in the local quiz! It was loads of fun and all the locals were so friendly and welcomming. Even though it was English based questions we didnt come last which we thought was a pretty good effort too!

Up early again to work out our little circuit of the cotswalds. We drove first down to Avebury,  http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-avebury or  http://www.avebury-web.co.uk/ which is kind of like Stonehenge, large neolithic stone circles dating back 5,000 years. It has a stone that has the devils seat on it and superstition says that if you run around the stone you will ward off the devil... so in our bulky jackets and scarves Val and I ran laps around and around the stone, much to the amusement of all the vehicles passing by I am sure! There are also sites marking the first farming community 6000 years ago and a `barber stone` beneath which it was thought that in medieval times a man was buried alive whilst assisting to fell the stone. He lay here for over 500 years until excavations discovered his crushed skeleton. Further evidence discovered more recently suggested he had been killed by a blow to his head and then thrown into the hole to be hidden!

We braved the dodgy English weather and walked the entire circle, avoiding the crazy sheep crossed with mountain goat things everywhere before heading on to Bourton-on-the-water ( www.bourtoninfo.com ) which was a beautiful little town in the Cotswalds on a little river about 3 inches deep, but so picturesque! It has stone roofs and gables and golden limestone buildings. There is also evidence to suggest a bronze age settlement whishi is pretty cool! We had a look at so many cool little lolly stores and tried licorice root... which is for all intensive purposes a stick that you chew on for about half an hour before you think you may taste aniseed! Definitely nothing to write home about!

Next stop was Stow-on-the-wald, another gorgeous little town where we sampled the beautiful local icecream and walked through all the cute little stores on the cobble-stoned streets.

Driving through countless more gorgeous little towns we arrived at Buscot House ( www.buscotpark.com ) which was built around 1780 and is owed and lived in by Lord Farrington who manages the property on behalf of the National Trust. It was actually brought by an Australian tyoon in 1895, Robert Tertius Campbell, who turned it into the most highly mechanised farm in the country which is kind of cool! The gardens again are extensive and we sat down and enjoyed a traditional English Cream Tea... i finally tried the clotted cream that I have been so repulsed by since arriving in this country and the consensus is that it is okay with jam on scones :+) i wouldnt eat it on anything else though and it is still so gross with teh chunks of fat on the top!!! ewwww!!!!

We spent ages walking around the gardens, down to their own private lake and being definitely super impressed. Seeing how the other half live that is for sure!

It seems that as well as a village pub, each town as a fish and chip shop and a curry house here so we sampled the local one, and it was pretty good!!

My last day of my mini trip Val was babysitting so I caught the bus into Oxford ( www.visitoxford.org ) - so convenient! And all i noticed was bicycles everywhere!!!! There were more bicycles than cars and more bicycles than people!! everywhere!!!! The stunning university town also had a walking tour that I jumped on and went inside of Oriel College, which is amazing! It is so well set out in beautiful old buildings, a landscaped courtyard and a dining hall that looks like it is straight from the Harry Potter movies! In fact, most parts of the Harry Potter movies were actually filmed here. We saw Halleys house and the observatory on top from where he discovered Halley`s commet and the site on which several clergymen were burned at the stake. 

Okay, hopefully that makes sense, I havnt had a chance to review it, but I am heading off to Europe tomorrow (as per next blog!!) so will hopefully edit when i return!! thanks for reading guys and until next time!! k xxxxxx

 

 

 
The amazing next phase... working for Topdeck Travel through Europe!! woohoo!! updated!

2009-05-16 to 2009-05-31


Well, it has been a crazy week and I am finally getting a chance to write and explain!

As it was 2 weeks after returning from my Topdeck tour to the Western Front for ANZAC Day, there was a reunion organised at the Walkabout at Sheppherds Bush here in London. It was a cold, miserable London day and I spent some time considering whether I should go, seeing as it was cold, wet, I didnt even know if anyone from my tour was definitely going, it was going to take me almost 2 hours to get there!

In the end I got motivated and headed in. It was quite crowded and I couldnt find anyone from my tour, so randomly started talking to a chick who.... to cut a long story short, worked for Topdeck and totally out of the blue offered me a chance to interview for a position working travelling around Europe for the summer. I had to interview next day as it was the final stages, which I randomly had off ( chance in a million!). I actually firstly said thanks, but no thanks as I had already told the USA I was heading back to summer camp. But after having nothing else run through my head I decided to interview and see how I went. By the time I arrived home and was up again to head to the Topdeck office I had managed less than 5 hours sleep but was rearing to go. With a stroke of luck, I had also managed to get an interview for another aussie friend, Jarrad from the Orange Tree who I had discused many times what an awesome job the tour industry would be to work in and we headed in together.

And we got offered a job! And training was to start the next week! Apparantly she saw something in us and wanted us to train as mobile chefs, so basically travelling around Europe, being paid to shop and cook at all the most beautiul places in the world. And the fact that I had never worked as a cook or chef, mere details... It was all about the person. :+)

I was on top of the world as working in travel is something that I have always wanted to do and it is actually quite a difficult industry to get a foot in the door to. But... I had already told the USA I was heading back, I absolutely loved working in America and I also currently had a job that I was not due to finish for another few weeks...

After a sleepless night, lots of amazing advice from my wonderful family and friends (thank you all so much), It was with a very heavy heart I advised summer camp I would not be heading back to the USA as I realised I just could not pass up this amazing totally random out of the blue opportunity.

My current place of work, the Orange Tree was also able to fill my last few weeks and I began my training in London. It was a little over a week since my world had turned upside down and it dawned on how serious this really was. There were people there that had applied for positions a year ago, interviewed all around the world, in groups, one on one and in front of a panel and had been told over 6 months ago that they were on the course. And I was there from a chance encounter in a pub. You cannot get more totally random than that. Or as i like to say, it was meant to happen :+) A week of classroom lessons began... and in one week we lost 4 trainees. So yep, a dream job, but it is not all roses!! The course is full on, 6 weeks - one week in the classroom and 5 weeks travelling around Europe. Amazing, yep - but it is a cross between Exercise Timor (for those that know it!! A very difficult army exercise centering on sleep deprivation!), boot camp and big brother, as the trainers call it a 6 week long job interview. We spend until 3am doing driving tours of cities so tour leaders can practice their spiels, drivers can practice their routes and then we get up at 5am again so the cooks can practice cooking!!!!!!!! And we are not paid on the training trip either so it is bread and water for me to get there!!

Our itinery is amazing.... Paris, France; Bruges Belgium; Amsterdam Netherlands; Berlin Germany; Dresden Germany; Prague Czech Republic; Vienna Austria; Tyrol Austria; Venice Italy; Verona Italy; Rome Italy; Orvieto Italy; Florence Italy; Pisa Italy; Antibes France; Monaco Monaco; Nice France; Antibes France; Barcelona Spain; Avignon France; Lauterbrunnen Switzerland; Paris France. BUT NO CAMERA`s!! I know!! Difficult when i have spent the last year with it permanently attached to me so it feels, but this is a trianing trip and we aren`t tourists so they say so no cameras! We are visiting some of the most beautiful and amazing places in the world... we are going on Gondola rides in Venice, up Jungfrau Mountain in Switzerland, the French Riviera, the leaning power of Pisa, Vatican City, the Berlin Wall, and the Matthausen Jewish concentration camp to name a few.

Unfortunaly i also wont have time to visit family this time through as i will be working constantly, but fingers crossed i make it through and I will have plenty of opportunity to take all the pictures in the world and hopefully my next tour i will drop by the Griffins and Cristinis in Barcelona and Rome!!!!!

Well I am sure you are all asking.. but waht are you actually doing??!! Well... I am a mobile chef, so basically as a travel company appealing to budget travellers, topdeck ( http://www.topdecktours.co.uk/content.asp?Document_ID=16 ) does a lot of camping trips that have a mobile chef included to cook the meals so the travellers dont really need to have any other $$. I make a meal plan and then cook dinner for most nights on the tour, provide a continential breakfast and sometimes a hot breakfast, picnic lunch or packed lunch. And I do it all on a 4 burner stove! Yep, just one mobile chef per tour!, making the entire meal plan myself, shopping in some foreign country I dont speak the language, and then cooking gourmet 3 course meals for up to 50 people in an hour and a half (max) in a 2m by 3m cook tent on a 4 burner gas stove in a campground! oh yes.. and catering with different meals for all the dietary requirements in the group!!! and yes, all home made!!!!! how hilarious is that!! Especially to those who have tasted some of the random creations i have made :+) But trained chefs rarely make it through training cause of the environment you are in. All you need is love of travel, a people personality, the ability to laugh when it all goes pear shaped, be willing to work hard, love something to do with food (need i crack out here the fact that I won third place in the Royal Melbourne Show for Cake Decorating! :+) ) and a sense of adventure. Bring it on i say!! i cant wait!!!

A sample day would be-

 breakfast - continental and 2 x hot item, such as eggs benedict or pancakes with glazed apple and cinnamon topping.

 lunch - picnic, 4 x different salads (you cannot repeat a single salad on the entire trip... which means you need about 120 :+)!! - you should see some of the crazy ones i have obtained of the net to achieve this!!)

 dinner : 

entree - bruscetta

main - chicken cordon bleu with a chunky tomato salsa and roasted root vegetables served with grilled asparagus

dessert - poached pears with a vanilla mascapone

Grandma - your marshmellow delight has made it in too! I will be `cooking` this for the tour in Germany!! yay!!!!!

I cannot stop laughing!! it is brilliant!!! There are now 5 cooks left - we lost one already this week. And so far have done all the general stuff, route maps, accounts, budgeting, dietary requirements, googled salads until we saw lettuce in our dreams, planned gourmet meal upon meal, written the worlds bigest 5 page shopping list for the first week of the tour we will have to buy all the ingredients for the entire first week in Calais and Paris, France as it is too expensive to shop in Switzerland and had a brilliant time wondering what on earth we are doing here!! it is great!

We have also planned out this amazing , amazing gourmet picnic we will spend all day creating in Paris and then set up on the Champ de Mar looking directly at the Eiffel tour with Prawns, Salmon, Escargot, quiche, cheese, meat and cake platters, 5 amazing salads and anything else you can possibly think of! crazy!

So we depart at 6am on Tuesday morning for 5 crazy weeks cooking around Europe. On the training trip we have tour leaders (about 16), mobile chefs (5) and drivers (about 11) all vying for jobs at the end - which there is plenty available as long as we make it through alive! Bring on the adventure!!!! I cannot wait!!!! :+ Wish me luck and i doubt i will have access to the internet on the road so look forward to catching up with everyone on my return in 5 weeks!!!

woohoo!!!

300 circuits of Paris, 5000 spiels&amp;an average 2 h sleep/night. Welcome to Crew Trg - Europe!

2009-05-26 to 2009-06-10


Well, yes it has been epic! And i will definitely write this tomorrow about our crazy adventures, however i will write the following blog now so you can see what i am up to and then come back to catch up!!!

 
Lasagna and Tiramisu. A crazy adventure leading me to life in Roma. updated

2009-06-11 to 2009-06-26


Sooooo, there I was... somewhat hazy, blurred vision and unable to think straight after no sleep for 2 weeks, but having an amazing adventure with an awesome bunch of people travelling to the most amazing places in Europe... Okay, so it was a training trip and it was constantly playing the game, constantly being watched, and constantly not being able to do a think right...but I like to think that after surviving the Australian Defence Force Academy, The Royal Military College and then being the one playing the games at the Army Recruit Training Centre I was somewhat on my way to mastering this &apos;game&apos; :+)

And so as I lay dying in my bed on our first night in Rome ( You will get to hear the background to this in my previous blog... once i write it!!!) I was awoken by the crew manager from London and all three staff coming in to tell me that as the top trainee i was being removed from the TT (trainig trip) to begin work as the site manager there in Rome, Something had come up and there was no one available to fill the position and they believed I could do it without finishing the training...

I wasnt sure what to think as firstly, i was going to be site manager, not 2IC, responsible for cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner for groups travelling through, doing the ordering, shopping, accounts and who knows what else!!! And lets faceit, I was kind of just making it all up as it was and hoping no one ever found out! :+)

I loved the people on the TT and didnt want to leave them behind, not finish the training and graduate and not see the rest of Europe with them all, but apparantly bigger and better things had come and I was really sad to wave them all goodbye as they continued on and i was left behind.

I have been told that I will be getting the primo trip - the mega european 7 week adventure that goes pretty much everywhere in a month when i finish in Rome so I will get to see everything I miss out on now then, so fingers crossed.It wont be with abunch of mates, but i guess i get to see it all and that is what counts. And i start to get paid here too which is always nice!! And probably better for my health too as i still cannot make it through the day without sleeping and coughing non stop...love chest infections!! :+)

 

So... wondering about the Lasagne and Tiramisu yet??? Well, let me start at the beginning! My home is Camping Roma, a 2000 person camping village with permanent tents, tent sites, cabins, pools, a supermarket, restaurant, 2 bars, an outdoor cinema... quite nice :+). I live in a cabin and work out of a permanently setup topdeck tent to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner for all tours that do not have a permanent cook attached to them. And... being in Rome, guess what I cook...?! Yup, Lasagne and Tiramisu!!! As each group only gets one dinner that is what I cook almost every night! And then do hundreds of dishes!!!!!!!!! Bacon and scrambled eggs for breakfast and 5 different salads for lunches. I will be doing it in my sleep by the time I leave here! The groups are up to 50 personnel and we can have up to 3 groups per night in the busy times. Full on, yes!! There is a supermarket across the road so I do shopping, trying to find things like rising agent and gluten free items without speaking any Italian, but just randomly waving my hands in the air for assistance and then carry back heavy bags of goods over the overpass in the scorching hot 30+ Roman heat willing the plastic not to break before I make it inside the tent. I then pick up 20 kilos of mince from the restaurant in a nice open tub and lug this back to the cook tent praying it doesn&apos;t slip from my fingers before I get the biggest arm workout of the century stirring it in a massive pot so it doesnt go lumpy. It totally cracks me up that 2 years ago I was a logistics officer in the Army. A year ago I was a camp counselor in the US and now I am a chef in Rome about to be paid to travel around Europe. How on earth did that all happen??!!


It is busy, but there is also time to chill out.... but only every now and again!!! This week I went out to dinner with Mon–the crew manager who I originally met in the pub in London and Danni, the girl I am working with at the campsite. We caught the train and walked down a few streets until right in front of us was the amazing Trevi fountain. There were hundreds of tourists but we managed to get into the front and throw the coins... A traditional legend says if visitors throw a coin into the fountain, they are ensured a safe return to Rome. Apparently two coins will lead to a new romance and three will ensure either a marriage or divorce. And if you throw all three coins with one&apos;s right hand over one&apos;s left shoulder it is lucky! We then went to a spagetteria which had so many options... 10 different types of bruscetta, and 130 different pasta sauces! crazy! Totally stuffed we then walked through the streets and out of the blue was the Pantheon, the oldest inhabitable building in the world...over 2000 years. Amazing! On the way we walked past these thousand year old columns and discovered they were just a museum Rome has that many relics! We somehow managed to fit in Gelato too... when in Rome! :+)

 
Livin la dulce vita, Lasagna Pans and Onions! Roma, Italy Updated!!

2009-06-26 to 2009-07-10

Livin la dulce vita  Lasagna Pans and Onion, Roma, Italy



After my first week in Roma I was confused...

no hot water- check

stinking hot weather -check

working 24/7 in a tent  check

cannot run outside so need to do 50 000 laps of a small circle around cabins  check

Timorese people speaking tetum  no, wait! Not Camp Phoenix, Timor Leste; Camping Roma, Italy!



I am sitting in the net cafe at Camping Roma and I have had to displace a cat from its sleeping position on the keyboard to be able to do this. Feral cats are not allowed to be harmed and as a result everywhere there are cats taking over the place! They even have their own forum  the cat forum- which is FULL of cats! It is old Roman ruins that have been taken over by cats! It is also reported to be the place where Julius Ceasar was stabbed.



It is funny watching people arrive in Italy and seeing their impatience at queuing up for an hour to get something they need... and then having to go to a separate counter and queue again to pick it up! Efficiency epitomised! But at least it keeps people in work I guess!! Italian time!



And geez are Italian drivers crazy!!! You take your life into your hands walking across the road. Where there are no pedestrian traffic lights the cars will never stop unless you walk. And so with confidence you have to step onto the road in front of all the oncoming traffic. Crazy!!! My aunty Lyn actually taught me a hint I still use everywhere. Walk with confidence and hold your hand out to make them stop. This shows them that you are definitely walking and they have to stop, not giving them the opportunity that if they keep zooming you will change your mind!



Well, I guess I am getting a little ahead of myself! So I was taken off the Training Trip and the first night here were trips in the other cook on the site got so drunk during the day at the pool with other topdeck staff that she was too drunk to o the dinner! And so there I was, no idea in the world! There was about 10 different dietaries as well and so myself and another trainee trip leader looked around, found some pans and somehow with a lot of random guessing thrown in threw together lasagnas and special lasagnas for all the dietary requirements!!! We couldnt figure out how to get the gas oven lit, but luckily someone else managed to do that! We were just looking at each other and shrugging...no idea in the world! Somehow or other it all worked out in the end though! Hilarious!! And then the next morning I had to figure out breakfast myself as she was too hungover to hang around. Luckily it wasnt rocket science! :-)



Now if there is one thing I will always remember about my time in Rome, it is lasagna pans. There is nothing I love more than at the end of a long day of cooking than looking over at the sink to see hundreds (well okay, 8) lasagna pans with baked on goodness sitting there smirking at me.



Unless it is onions, yup chopping onions has got to come close! And I dont know what it is about the onions in Rome, but they make you cry. A lot. Every day my cookie off sider Rhiannon and I stood there and chopped and cried and chopped and cried. What a great start to the day!



The remainder of the day consisted of getting up at the crack of dawn to fry almost 200 eggs ( nope and this time I am not even exaggerating!!!), be splattered in the face by burning bacon fat, wash a million dishes and then start on lunches! And then on dinner! Eggs, Bacon, Cous cous, lasagne, tiramisu, dishes. Eggs, Bacon, Cous cous, lasagne, tiramisu, dishes. Eggs, Bacon, Cous cous, lasagne, tiramisu, dishes. Eggs, Bacon, Cous cous, lasagne, tiramisu, dishes. You get the picture! :-)



But as the Rome Site Managers, Rhi and I did have a lot of fun together, we laughed every day at what we had to do, and then laughed even harder when we had to walk over the road to the Panarama supermarket and then push overloaded trolleys back up the ramp over the pedestrian overpass, up the road, and up the hill into the campsite, sweating uncontrollably trying to move the trolleys in the summer Rome heat.



We laughed when we got back and we somehow had to tetris every single thing we had brought into our 2 fridges as it was so hot out they would ruin otherwise. I dread to think how many wasted hours we spent tetris-ing that fridge down every day to fit everything new into it! We would scream when someone went to open the door and move something... there was such a delicate balance one wrong move and 2 days worth of food would come tumbling out at you!



We laughed when we spent hours stirring milk, making a béchamel sauce for the lasagne, in fact we came to a compromise where I hated doing this so much Rhi would do it and my trade off would be chopping onions or making vegetarian lasagnes I detested it that much! I did one day accidently added cinnamon instead of nutmeg too and I was so over it I refused to make another. No one noticed anything different :-) Both the Italian jars still look the same to me now!!



We often had 3 groups in, so almost 150 people in for breakfast in our little cooktent and we had one little regular toaster, and one little regular kettle. We did have industrial ones, but the power surges had fried them and you couldnt buy industrial ones in Italy. So we brought extra and plugged them in... and tripped the power. Nope! Back to the inconvenient mini ones. Welcome to Camping Roma!!



And that cooktent was so hot! Like up to 50C! We would stand over the hot elements stirring cauldrons of simmering food whilst the sun pelted down and made a sauna of the cooktent and we just dripped sweat. So lovely!!



We were having problems with the gas and so after some effort managed to find a gas man to come out and have a look. I suspected a leak and so I stood there in amazement as the first thing he did was whip out his cigarette lighter, click on the flame and run it down the hoses until it burst into flames. Yup, looks like a leak there! We also had to try and get the gas bottles swapped over at one stage and he arrived in his little truck... But refused to speak a word of English or even acknowledge my Spanish, my dodgy Italian or universal sign language. I ended up having to call the campsite reception or spoke to him to no avail, and then have someone sent up to translate as he stood there and took great delight in pretending I was an idiot  open, close, open, close. I get it!!!!! Ah! Italians!!!!!



Another day Rhi and I went out with our topdeck friend Marky Mark into town and had a fantastic day, we saw the Barack Obama cavalcade drive past, were absolutely amazed at the inside of Colosseum, walked throughout Rome, ate mountains of Gelati, and then argh! Time to get home to cook dinner for a group!! Of course when you are in a rush, nothing ever turns out right and we were miles away from the metro station. Running through the city we managed to jump onto the train and then stood forever anxiously waiting at the bus stop... and waiting... waiting...waiting! We jumped off and ran up the hill into the campsite, turned the oven on and started throwing lasagna together into layers, pasta, meat, cheese, béchamel as fast as anything ever seen before to throw them in the oven. So the 15 mins to layer, the hour and a bit they usually take to cook, plus the 15 mins sitting time.... well, somehow we amazingly managed to pull it all off in about 45 mins and some brilliant stalling and no one was ever the wiser!! Although I must say we definitely had to scrub those lasagna pans a little bit harder that night after having the oven on mega the whole time :-)



Another time we were having problems lighting the pilot light to get the oven on. We ended up pulling the oven apart for several days to light it up and then quickly putting it back together before it got too hot and we burnt ourselves.... until one day when it refused to light. The lasagnas sat there as I frantically ran to the campsite restaurant  nope, no free oven space but they could do us 35 pizzas but it would take over 45 mins! Argh!! And then miracle, it turned on! Lasagnas in, we turn the side salad into a starter to buy some time and ta da! Brilliance once again :-)



I think the entire month we were in Rome, Rhi and I had one full day off. We wanted to make the most of it and someone had told us about a beautiful place to visit, called Tivoli. Excited, we had a sleep in for the first time in several months and caught the bus to then catch the train to Tiburtin to change and catch another train and then get off at Tivoli. But of course that painful journey was far too easy to be right! Although that had already taken us almost 2 hours, turns out that Tivoli train station is not actually anywhere near Tivoli where we needed to be! We then had to wander the streets until a storeowner took pity on us, gave us bus tickets and took us to the right bus stop! Another 20 mins later we had arrived..somewhere! We had asked a random lady on the bus to tell us which stop to get off at for the famous Villa DEste and apparently there we were! Walking up and down aimlessly for a while we finally came across a little sign and we had made it! After all day of travelling into a random location we paid our entrance and entered the old estate home and grounds and I must say, it was gorgeous, with waterfalls, foundations, gardens and you name it, we thoroughly enjoyed walking around and taking it all in. We left excited, only to wander some more and realise that was all there was!! We had travelled all day and felt ripped off! Laughing we made our way back to another train station 5 mins away and headed home. So much for that recommendation!!



I also caught up with my Uncle Eduardo, Aunty Lyn and cousin Viviana for a fantastic homecooked Italian meal with the strange ham and melon combination and the most amazing grilled eggplant with tomato sauce and breadcrumbs, amongst other things. Delicious! On another day Aunty Lyn also took me on a massive walking tour of all of Rome that you dont normally see, walking around the Vatican, to Piazza Novona, eating fresh pizza and Gelati, all the way down the Tiber River and everywhere! Definitely one of my favourite days in Rome :-).



The pope also does a Papal Mass in St Peters Square at the Vatican each month and I was lucky enough to have an easy day the day it was on and so headed into town with some tour leaders  Brook and Joey. We got our tickets, went through the massive crush through security and got seats semi close to the front, watching as Pope Benedict XVI drove by in his pope-mobile waving just a few metres away!! It was definitely amazing, but the thing that really struck me was how old and fragile the pope looked! He then started his mass, seated on a massive chair outside, but we were still quite a way away and with it all in Latin we headed off and did a bit of walking around Rome.



Next day I was lucky enough to again have some time that I could head into town and go on one of the walking tours with another TL  Tim who is an ex breakfast radio personality! As you can imagine he is brilliant and I had a fantastic afternoon with him and his tour group seeing all the sights in Rome! I walking through Rome, then you turn a corner and there is the Pantheon! Or there is Trevi fountain! It is just absolutely amazing. I do definitely love the Pantheon though  one of my most favourite places! Rome is definitely an amazing city, from the Spanish steps you can see the flags flying of debatably the worlds smallest country  the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM). Some countries consider it as a sovereign organization, others consider it as a country without territory, others consider it as the world&apos;s smallest country (a building and a garden - 6000 square meters). It has many of the functions of a country: it has diplomatic relations with many countries, issues passports, flag, money and stamps and it&apos;s a member of a few international organizations, but still the debate goes on!



The other really really cool place on the tour is the Cappuchin monks, which contains the bones of about 4000 Cappuchin monks, arranged in arches, light fittings, hanging from the ceiling and any other way you can think of, filling the entire passageway! Their motto is what you are we once were, what we are you will become which is pretty interesting too.



I also visited Trastevere with some other crew one night  it is a really really cool suburb full of windy streets, restaurants, bars, gelati and little stores. It is definitely one of my favourite areas in Rome. We then headed back into town to participate in one of the city pub crawls which was also definitely a laugh. Other days other topdeck crew were in we sat by the pool and chatted in between making salads and cooking lasagna, and at the end of the day sat down at the pool in the beautiful warm evenings and listened to the live bands the campsite put on, had peanut parties in the bar or just chilled out. Not bad really!



One hilarious day was a tour came through and got really really rotten drunk, and the next morning 1 person turned up to breakfast on time!! (Out of about 40!), then a few stragglers came in, but a grand total of 10 people! They were heading into town to do the tour of the Vatican and had to leave at a certain time to make it. Lets just say a lot of people missed the tour that day! It is hard though when they do because they then spend the morning coming up to you like you can make it all better when there is nothing you can do for them!



Dani, who originally started out at the Rome site as the other cook with me left for her trip part way through my time and was replaced by Rhi who I talk a lot about. The day she left though was epic. It was a day I had 3 groups in and just me to do it!!! I started in the kitchen at 0600 and didnt finish until 2230h. That is 16 ½ hours!! And boy was I tired!! Luckily I had some awesome other crew in with me that day and some of the drivers stood around with me for a few hours each helping me chop and cook and stir!! Thank goodness!



Another night we had some idiot passengers that again got quite drunk and started smashing up the plastic outdoor chairs and tables and so were kicked out by security. They spent that night sleeping on the footpath outside the campsite until their TL found out the next morning and had to go make peace and make them pay for all the damage to let them back in! Ridiculous!!



One absolutely hilarious night we had some passengers in who taught Rhi and I a drinking game called Cardinal Huff where you have to memorise a little chat and arm, hand and feet actions to go with it or you have to scull. Luckily I managed to pick it up quite quickly and survived relatively unscathed. Unfortunately Rhi did not. As a consequence she cant even remember the night and I have never laughed so hard the next morning when she turned up to breakfast about an hour late as I had 4 pans going, cooking bacon and eggs in all of them like a mad woman trying to get it done myself before the group arrived helped out as much as she could, then lay down on the bench seat and practically died. I have never seen some one so useless in all my life. Hilarious!!!



It started out a nice sunny Roman day like every other when I decided to walk down the highway to the store. Unfortunately there was no path and so I had to brave the Italian drivers as I got there. There seemed to be an unusual colour forming in the sky as I walked, off in the distance, a kind of really deep blue/grey, but it was a long way off so I just kept walking. But all of the sudden if was halfway towards me. I ducked into a store, came out and it was just powering along to above me until the entire sky as far as I could see was covered in this heavy grey cloud. And then the rain started, not just rain, but the heaviest rain possible! Like a tropical wet season downpour! I ran for shelter to the nearest service station and hid from the howling wind pushing the rain in every direction. Within minutes the streets had flooded, drivers were all seeking shelter at the service station to avoid crashing in the massive flooding and lack of visibility. I waited there for half an hour, saturated, freezing cold and trying to huddle out of the train, but it did not abate. There was no end in sight to the cloud or the rain as I had to make a decision, I still had at least half an hour before I made it back home to the campsite and I was freezing! And so I braved it. I began walking uphill at the side of the road with almost knee deep water gushing down towards me, luckily the drivers had slowed down, but each time they grew close I tried to press myself in towards the cement bollards so they wouldnt hit me as they sprayed me further with water.



Slowly but surely I was beginning to make progress, as nasty as the conditions were, when a car pulled up beside me, the driver wound the window down and shouted something to me and gestured for me to get into his car. Now the thought did go through my head that I was about to die as I walked over to the window, but I figured there was probably just as much chance as someone hitting me on the highway anyway! But then he said Camping Roma and I jumped in, saturated and dripping anyway. Turns out he was one of the managers at Camping Roma and thought he had recognized me. Lucky! No kidnappers here and I survive to live another day :-)



Pulling up outside the cooktent, I dashed inside to be confronted by an awful site. The gutter of the building next door does not exist, and so all the water was pouring down the side, gathering in a spot it could not escape from and flooding into the cooktent. The entire cooktent was under a few inches of water, as Rhi also arrived and we ran to rescue all our stock that was sitting on the floor and grab the electrical powerboards. The amazing design indicated only one drainage point, and that was on an upwards slope so it took us several hours to sweep all the water out and put the cooktent back into some kind of order. So lucky we did not have a dinner on that night or we would never have been able to finish everything in time!



But unfortunately the rain set in for a few days and every afternoon about 3, the clouds would come over and the rain would pour down. We spoke to the campsite, but it seems it was just one of those things we had to deal with!

If you don&apos;t start behaving I&apos;ll send you to Antarctica...!


By Karinya Kosh June 30th, 2009 | 11:37 am


An idle threat from an overworked mum to a cheeky 8 year old sparked my imagination and began me on my mission to make it to the coldest, windiest, driest; but most beautiful place on earth. -89.2&apos;C? Bring it on!
A mission ongoing for over a quarter of a century and counting, through militia roadblocks in the Himalayas, lying on a drip in a 1920&apos;s equipped hospital in Peru, watching the first rays of the sun rise over Machu Picchu, plunging toilets in Pennsylvania, eating fried guinea pig, and discovering it is possible to eat every flavour of Italian gelati and not explode.

In between I obtained degrees, became a Logistics Officer in the Australian Army and tried my hand at real life... But soon realised the need to continue on my quest. I began volunteer work in Peru, became a camp counselor in the USA, danced in an MTV video, walked the death railway in Thailand, couchsurfed through Scandinavia and randomly began work for a travel company in Europe. So, yes, technically its not exactly leading me to the penguins, but I figure I am taking the most fun and scenic route there!

And thats me. I live to have fun. I love to travel and thrive on the adventure, possibilities and experiences that it brings. I am passionate about life, obsessed by penguins, peanut butter and things that can make a difference. The way I see it,‘Be the change you want to see in the world’... you only live once, so make the most of it!

So forget the &apos;why&apos; and ask &apos;why not?!&apos;.... Vote 1 Karinya, follow my Antarctic quest and live the dream with me! See you all from the Lyubov Orlova!

 

 
Delhi belly, Flap drying and how to survive 47 days camping around Europe! Part 1 to Roma!!

2009-07-12 to 2009-07-26


After arriving at the crew house in Holland it was time to spend the day sorting out all the equipment in the shed ready to go... this was all supposed to be laid out ready, but of course it wasn&apos;t! so I precariously climbed over mountains of crates and who knows what to put together an on road kitchen of sorts! I have a container of pots, a container of plastic plates and cups, a picnic box with tupperware, a set of gas burners and a tent! Now cook for 40 people!!!! We ended up a little short on chair, cups,bowls and fridges but luckily I managed to &apos;acquire&apos; these along the road!!!


The supermarket in the next town, Goes was closing at 5 and at 3 when the car still hadn&apos;t returned I was starting to wonder how the food was to magically appear, but we managed to find it and zoom off just in time. My driver Brent and I raced around the supermarket but couldn&apos;t find cooking cream to make a carbonara for dinner. Eventually with some hand gestures to the staff we discovered something similar and added it to the trolley... But as she scanned the items the checkout chick was &apos;what are you doing with all the coffee cream?&apos; and we are coffee cream???!! ummmmm!!! And so I ran back to ask someone to help us out to find the right stuff again! I grabbed a stash and there was a staff member there grabbing a crate of another type. As I arrived at the checkout lugging arms full of cream she just laughed and told me my husband already had it as i looked at the staff giving Brent all the cream from the fridge. As I turned to return it somehow there was some form of explosion and every single tub of cream dropped and bounded across the floor with an almighty clang as the entire supermarket stopped to look,laugh and then start applauding! We finally managed to escape and headed back to pack the bus ready for departure the next morning!


Brent and I headed for the docks in Calais to pick up our Tour Leader Leticia and passengers coming off the ferry from Dover. It was a great mix with 38 passengers, half half boys and girls and from all countries including Korea, China, Aus, NZ, USA, UK, Canada, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and a few more! We hit the road and arrived in Paris to setup camp! Shaking out the cooktent we all recoiled in horror as the stench of mould overwhelmed us and then quickly stepped forward as if nothing happened to convince the passengers this was the greatest cooktent over that we were about to set up! We taught them to set up their tents and we brought out all the food and crates from the bus and these were placed in a not so handy mess in the tent as i got cracking cooking dinner and demonstrating to them how to flap dry their plastic plates to ensure they were dry before we put them back so we would not all get sick! Just think of pretending to fly flapping your arms up and down vigorously holding plastic plates, bowls etc! Hilarious, but definitely a handy life skill to would say... you can use it anywhere!! I also allocated all the duties out as there are so many jobs to do on a camping trip such as packing, getting water, washing the pots, blowing up the lilos and all sorts of other fun chores!


The passengers all left with the driver and tour leader on the Paris driving tour as I sorted out the cooktent and prepared for the next day... crazy long day as I got just a couple of hours sleep before cooking a hot breakfast and heading off the to metro supermarket to shop again! The Metro is a MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE BULK BULK BULK supermarket with the worlds biggest flatbed shopping trolleys that gives you nightmares to think about!! it is near impossible to find anything as it is SOOOOOOOoo large and too bad if you just want a couple of something–you must buy it in bulk or not at all! We had to buy a fridge and somehow this totally confused the checkout chicks. They have a system where you leave everything on your trolley and they scan it, you then go to another counter with the receipt and pay and then someone checks it all again before you walk out the door. Somehow this system took us about 2 hours as we slowly watched the time ticking away when we needed to be back at camp preparing the gourmet Paris picnic for that evening!!! We finally escaped and headed to the next supermarket to pick up the things we couldnt get, refuelled the bus and raced back to the campsite,unloading trolleys and trolleys worth of shopping and running around like crazy people to prepare the picnic which normally takes 4 hours in about 2! Luckily we were alongside another tour and all working together we fixed a gourmet feast, jumped into the bus and headed into the Eiffel tower to await our passengers for a fantastic picnic. A Seine river cruise followed before I spend the night sorting out the cooktent and finishing the drive day picnic before starting breakfast and onto the bus to head for Lauterbrunnen in the beautiful Swiss Alps!


The most amazing scenery is around every turn as you drive in with a raging river, the snow capped alps and flowing waterfalls and you can see every single part of it from our campsite! So beautiful! A crazy driving day though as all the roads were closed off and we followed massive diversions into who knows where, but luckily I finally had the opportunity to bleach the cooktent and try to make it somewhat respectable and head into town with Brent for a quick berry flavoured beer, yes so good! And hike up to the waterfall before running back to cook dinner. The passengers were in heaven with as much chocolate fondue as they could eat for dessert! So tasty!


The kids headed up Jungfrau, the highest mountain in Europe into the snow and enjoyed the beautiful scenery, some even skydiving from a helicopter before we rolled out onto the road again to the beautiful medieval city of Avignon, France to do another shop. It is amazing how much food 40 people can put away! Picnicking on the River we watched the sunset and completed another tough day in the office! One of our little Korean passengers got lost and we had to send a rescue party into town to retrieve her around midnight when she hadnt returned!


Stopping at the 2000 year old Roman Aquaduct at Pont du Gard which has such remarkable architecture that today still stands as built and is used daily as a road. Crazy hey.


We arrived in Barcelona and for the first time this trip were staying in a bed in a hostel right in the middle of town which was definitely a nice treat for everyone. We also had another treat- the first restaurant meal for the trip which was good for me as it was the first night that i didnt have to cook and good for the passengers as it was nice and social and there were no dishes to wash up! We headed down LaRambla for dinner and a night out where 3 of our passengers managed to get pickpocketed!!!!!!


Finally managing to catchup on sleep to counteract the 3 hours i had been getting each night so far, Brent, Leticia and I headed out to lunch and then...shopping of course!


Next stop was the lovely French perfumery of Fragonard and then onto Antibes in the French Riviera where we had to park the bus outside the campsite and carry everything in down hundreds of stairs to a cement level where we set up our tents. Comfy! Also right next to a little river full of mosquitoes and 6 toilets for the entire campsite spread across 3 random locations. Delightful! And no toilet paper of course. :) Shopping the next day it was time to prepare a picnic to have for dinner at a lookout over the French Riviera on the way to Monaco. We all dressed in our best camping finery and jumped on the bus for our picnic overlooking the most amazing views over the Mediterranean Sea and all the giant yachts and houses of the rich and the famous in Monaco. We stopped at the Royal Palace before heading into the casinos at Monte Carlo to test our luck.


Heading into Italy we stopped in Verona to see the balcony made famous by Romeo and Juliet before arriving in Venice to our next restaurant meal and toga party! We met up with about 4 other Topdeck groups so it was an awesome night, even if some of the toga tying left a lot to be desired!!


Heading into Venice the next morning we saw the Rialto Bridge, St Marks Square and St Marks Cathedral which is just beautiful...even if it is super full of disgusting pigeons!!!! We watched a glass blowing demonstration which was pretty impressive and then headed onto the grand canal for gondola rides through all the little streets of Venice. It was so ridiculously hot we almost melted by the time we headed to catch the water taxi and ferry back to the campsite. I had to then race to the supermarket to shop and back to prepare dinner before the passengers arrived back from town. Unfortunately the drain blocked in the sinks an I had 2 brilliant passengers who spent a good hour scrubbing out the risotto pot and unblocking the sink. So lucky with the passengers!! We had an around the world ping pong competition before it was time to head back to the cook tent to make the salads for the next drive day picnic!


Day 11 already!!! Next stop was to drop me off to shop whilst the passengers headed in to see Pisa and the famous leaning tower. And wow was it hot. I dont know if it could possible have been any hotter as we again totally melted. Luckily i found the delicious lemon gelati with licorice sticks that we could give to the pax as they arrived back onto the bus and I have never head such a sigh of relief as the last passenger arrived, the doors shut and the aircon turned on.


Arriving in Florence we managed to somehow battle the heat enough to set up all our tents and then head down to town to watch the sunset over the River Arno and have dinner at the House of Sizzle followed by a fun filled night of karaoke at the Red Garter. Another hot breakfast the next morning and finally some time to relax in the campsite over looking the gorgeous city trying to escape the heat. The sunset was so gorgeous we couldn&apos;t help but head out to watch it again and take a million photos.


On the road again we dropped off the passengers and arrived in Camping Roma ready to head out to the metro and shop... again! And then the next morning it was time to drag the shopping trolley over the overpass to Panarama supermarket and shop some more... nothing like feeling you are in Rome when you have to push a heavy supermarket up those hills!


Rome is a massive 3 course feast of bruscetta, lasagna and then tiramisu... and yes, lasagna cooked on the burners without an oven. Rome was about40 degrees when we were there and inside the stifling cooktent i swear it must have been about 50. Nasty!!!!!!!! But the meal was a hit so alls well that ends well. The passengers even ate an entire tray of left over tiramisu for breakfast the next morning!

The crew life, Wembledinge, The Netherlands

2009-08-27 to 2009-09-04

Arriving back at the depot we quickly unloaded and headed to the crew house to catch up with everyone an sleep!!! I have no idea where the week went, but it was a mix of sleeping, washing clothes, repacking the equipment and thats about it!



Oh yes... apart from discovering this amazing things called Speculoos and stroop waffels which we then found in icecream form also. Amazing!!! Deliciousness epitimized!!!!There was a group of people from my training trip at the house so we had an awesome catch up, went into the nearest town, Goes, on a few bike rides and runs with one of the boys, Marky Mark and ate ribs....which I had never had before and found surprisingly delicious!! It is true the country is ridicuously flat, full of dykes and windmills and so pretty! So we took lots of photos, watched the amazing sunset over the sea several times, lounged around in our pyjames and I have no idea where the rest of the time went before it was time to hit the road again!



Oh and we also have a cat! Well, it actually belongs to the neighbours (who we dont know!) but it practically spends its whole time at our house, just eating! It is called the Ginger Ninja and it may well be in fact the grumpiest cat to ever walk the earth! The first time I met it, it was hiding under a bed I happened to stand next to and attacked my feet, drawing blood! And it was painful!! It is so nasty!! But really, who doesnt want a cat called the Ginger Ninja :-).
 
From Paris to Berlin and every disco I

2009-09-05 to 2009-09-10

From Paris to Berlin and every Disco Ive been in...



On the road again! EF05/09 (Europe Unplugged) which is the month long camping tour through all the main sites in Western Europe. As the EF starts on a Saturday, you cannot shop in Paris as you normally do on the Sunday so I left the crew house a few days early to get to Paris and shop before my tour arrived!



I drove down to Calais docks with Sean and had a great sing along in our empty coach. We met Emma and the tour and carried on to our hotel in Paris. Normally when you arrive in Paris on a camping trip you rush to explain how to set up the tents, the cooktent, get all the equipment, get dinner cooked, dishes done and then onto the bus again for the Paris driving tour. But it is SO easy on a hostel tour! We arrived, checked in, ate a relaxed dinner in the restaurant, had a few drinks and then headed off! It was fun doing the driving tour and seeing all the beautiful sights again as normally as a cook you are too busy organising food for the next day to go!

The next morning I caught the train out to Joinville La Pont (Camping du Tremblay) to be picked up by the Paris site rep Scotty Dont Know. Unfortunately he had missed his alarm, but finally heard his phone and came out to get me. We headed to Paris Metro, the massive supermarket we do our shopping at and several hours later we somehow managed to power pack 5 MASSIVE metro trolleys full of things into the back of the van! Very impressive! Back to the campsite we emptied it all out and I waited the imminent arrival of my tour with my tour leader Dutch Nooky and driver Irish Paddy (or Dave). The bus rolled up and we began the demonstrations, set up all the equipment and began cooking in earnest! The toilet and shower block was mysteriously closed and with it the electricity! We then had to trek across the campsite to the only other ablutions and I had to get an extension lead to run over the road to get power!! Crazy! As a result I had no power in the tent, had to do all my chopping and organising with a headlamp and had to convince passengers to sit out in the middle of the campsite to use the electricity and toaster!

Across from our camp was a French rugby team who thought it was hilarious that we flap dried all our dishes (waving them around in the air until they are dry as we cannot physically carry enough tea towels and keep them dry and clean for an entire bus). One day whilst in the cooktent they came up and left several sheets of clean toilet paper on my front table. Perplexed I followed them to find out  so we no longer had to wave around our plates they said!

The Paris campsite is also well known for its thieving gypsies. Anything you want to keep we are always conscious of zipping up inside our tents and just keeping our valuables with us. Before the French Rugby team left they donated all their leftover items to me in the cooktent  some cheeses, chips, baguettes and their BBQ. I didnt really need their BBQ but took it to be polite with all the rest of the things that they so kindly gave. It didnt fit in the cooktent so I left it just outside with a few other items inside it...and yep, several hours later when returning to the cooktent, it had all magically disappeared!!!! Thieving Gypsies!



The bus we had been given was also ridiculous for a camping tour! It was not a bus designed for camping trips with very very little space for storage. Every single day of the trip without fail we tetris-ed all the luggage and equipment in, and sometimes had to pull it all out and start over again just to try and make it fit! What a nightmare! In times of desperation when the passengers were late with their luggage we just made them take it on the bus with them! :-)



Packing up we hit the road for my first drive day with the group to beautiful Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland (TCS Club Schutzenbach). I started to learn all the passengers names and we ended up with about 5 Andrews and a few other A names. I decided it was just much easier to call them all Andrew. Problem solved! :-) Along the day our driver managed to break all 100 eggs I had purchased to cook for breakfast the next morning and we had no where to buy them! And didnt tell me! Just as well I noticed the box at lunch. Luckily calling ahead to the campsite, the lovely site rep Rivettt managed to buy out all the eggs in town for me. Phew! Crisis averted!!

It is a massive long drive day and we arrived quite late as we rushed to put up the cooktent and begin dinner. As usual it was pumpkin soup and chicken cordan bleu, potatoes and veg which was one of the easiest preparations I have ever had with my wonderful Tour Leader Nooky sitting with me the entire time helping chop, stir, wash and organise! It was still a nightmare trying to fit it all with the burners we had so had to run inside and ask the site rep to borrow their stove to finish off the soup! Again it was dark by the time we were all eating and trying to wash up, but dinner successfully completed and we could head to the bar and relax!!

I had booked in for a sky dive the next day! Skydiving is one of the optional activities we do in Lauterbrunnen and I had been scheduled for midday. I got up early to do breakfast, went grocery shopping with the site rep Rivett, sorted it all out and was ready!!! I walked down to the office, excited, but also a little nervous and then found out they had overbooked and I had to come back at 3!!!!! Totally bummed out I walked into town, waited for time to tick over and then headed back again! It was quite nice though as some of my passengers were taking a scenic flight of the Alps so I was able to chill out with them whilst we waited for AGES! We drove down to the Helipad and did the drills, got into our fluro orange suits and then spent some more time waiting! I was totally fine still, and felt lucky as Stefan, the owner and our Topeck POC and VERY experienced skydiver was my diving buddy! I was strapped to the front of Stefan and we climbed in. The chopper lifted off and it was gorgeous. I was sitting doorside...although there is no door! It is a massive open space with the freezing cold wind rushing in so much my teeth were chattering and my fingers clutching the rope tied to the floor were numb. And then we got higher, and higher, and higher and I started freaking out!!!! Stefans foot was just hanging out of the side of the chopper, the ground was about 14000ft below us, we were as high as the mountains, it was freezing, windy and all of the sudden I didnt want to jump anymore. I was SO ridiculously scared I was crying and refused to jump. But we kept circling and circling getting higher and higher and it just made it worse!!!! I turned to Stefan and told him but he just continued smiling and pointing out the features we were passing. I refused again, refused to let go of the rope I was holding... and then I am not exactly sure what happened. He put the camera in my face, made me say something or other, and then I was hanging outside the chopper and not very happy at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I honestly have no idea how he managed to manoeuvre me around and pry my fingers away, but then a sort of calm descended over me. And then we fell. OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! I was screaming so badly I lost my voice, my mouth dried up, my throat hurt, my eyes were jammed shut and I was grabbing the straps so hard with my fingers I couldnt pry them away. Stefan tapped me to do the motions we had practiced on the ground, but to no avail and then practically had to hit me and move my arms to get me into the right position. I was SO scared and not happy at all!!!! It was awful!!! But then suddenly Stefan said something and we were violently jerked upwards. Even more scary!! I felt Stefan look up  The chute opened  he said. That was lucky. I was still kind of stunned and just hung there but then realised it was okay! Thank God I said!!! And opened my eyes :-) It was actually really nice and peaceful hanging there  after the freefall it didnt feel like we were moving at all and it was definitely a nice sensation!! The scenery was stunning and we floated way over to a mountain, so close to a house I could see the potplants on the windows and then we started doing spirals and twirls!!!!! Not so much fun!!!!! I again screamed and closed by eyes, but before I knew it I was holding my legs up and bracing for the landing. It was actually really soft! We just flew in really gently and skidded along the ground on our butts for a few metres and that was it! It didnt hurt at all!

I was totally rattled though and fell over when I tried to stand up! I had to hold on to Stefan as he asked me questions about it. Im sure the usual response is something like wow, it was amazing, I cant wait to do it again or the like... Mine was something like um... well... Im glad Ive done it. But I dont want to ever do it again!

Nooky and Josh from the Bar as well as the scenic flight passengers were also there to watch which was really nice. Apparently they could hear me screaming from the ground when we had fallen from the chopper!!!! I also got a DVD of the jump which we watched on the bus on the next drive day  I thought it was going to be hilarious, but they had managed to chop out all the parts that looked like I was about to kill Stefan for making me jump! It was definitely still entertaining though!!



That night we had our first restaurant meal in the bar there  cheese fondue, Chicken and Rosti  a fried shredded potato pancake thing! Very popular in Switzerland... but all very bad for you!



Another breakfast and lunch and we were on the road again!! Off to Avignon, France (Campsite Auberge Bagatelle). I was dropped off at the Supermarket on the way to the campsite and started my shopping whilst the others put up the tents and the driver returned to get me. The supermarket is MASSIVE! And I am quietly convinced that one end is uphill as well so it is a massive workout by the end pushing 3 shopping trolleys around! It has everything you need though which is nice, so finished off and headed to the campsite, which is a cool little campsite right on the river directly opposite the walled medieval city of Avignon ! It is a nice chilled out evening so I really like to sit with the crew and have a picnic dinner watching the sunset over the city. Ahhh so beautiful! Before heading back to do the washing up and lunch for the next day! :-(
 
From Paris to Berlin and every disco I&apos;ve been in.... Part 2 Europe

2009-09-11 to 2009-09-16

Onto the French Riveria! I think it is SO overrated! I would never voluntarily choose to go there!! We stay in Antibes, about half an hour from Nice, at Camping Panorama, or as we like to call it, Camping Auschwitz. It has 2 small blocks of toilets with 2 toilets and 2 showers, NO toilet paper, soap or hand towels or anything. No parking so you have to leave the coach on the street.... and carry everything you need down 4 different levels!! Yup, tents, backpacks, cooktent, cooking equipment, food and you name it is lugged down all the levels of stairs. Not fun at all! And if we get lucky we camp on the bottom level which is a cross between dirt and grass right next to a mosquito filled stagnant river, so you are humid, muggy and constantly bitten, or you camp on the concrete a level up! Strangely enough I prefer the concrete!

On the way here we stop at Fraganards French Perfumery which is quite nice as we as the crew are often given a bottle of wine, a nice cold drink and a little present such as a small perfume, soap or something else that we fancy. It makes the timings a little tight though as we rush back to camp, I quickly whip up a massive picnic feast, get changed and we all get onto the bus to head out to Monaco! It is a gorgeous drive up there and a beautiful spot for a picnic on the side of the road overlooking the harbour which we always all love. Then to the casino! It is pretty cool watching the massive opulence that is there in the people, cars, clothing and everything but I guess by the third time you have been and arent gambling I was started to get tired and couldnt even stay awake on the bus on the way home!

Next day was a rarity  We were so organised that we managed to have the morning off to wander around Nice which was awesome as I had not yet had a chance to do it. We shopped for some fluro clothes for our fluro party the next day, had lunch and then it was time to pick up the kids, be dropped off to the do shopping, quickly sort it all out and then back onto the coach for an evening in Antibes town.

Again I hadnt been here before either and I loved it! It was definitely my favourite place in the French Riviera so far! There was ancient city walls guarding the city, the beaches were beautiful and had SAND!!!! Not rocks, like the rest of the Riviera, there were cute little cobbled streets to walk through and a place to picnic overlooking the water. And even more, it was not filled with pretentious locals or tourists! Just people enjoying themselves. Lovely!!

It was the morning of our Fluro party! Dressing up in pink fluro tights, a pink off the shoulder top, side ponytail with fake curls, fluoro yellow leg warmers and accessories I headed down to start breakfast and laugh at the outfits that were out. It was a great day, stopping at service stops along the way and having everyone just stare at us! We made it to Pisa where we took some awesome photos in front of the leaning tower, and then a fabulous fluro group shot. We had randoms coming up to also take photos of us and ask us if we were a performing group, a travelling band or what?!

Arriving in Camping Michaelangelo in Florence we set up camp and then the passengers fluoro-ed themselves up even more for our evening out!! We all sat around the bus having a few drinks, a few laughs and then I met a driver friend Marky Mark who was there doing shuttles and we walked the group down to dinner at the House of Sizzle and Red Garter. But wow the group was already drunk! We had to be asked to calm them down by management as we vainly tried, but luckily we made it through to the club for some Karoake and a night of dancing! As you come through a lot, it was nice to see all the staff again  Francisco and Alex who always really look after you.

Nursing a lot of massive hangovers we somehow managed to get our group up the next morning, camp packed up and down to their walking tour... so we could then fall back into bed!!! But all too soon it was time to try and find our shuttle driver Marcus and hit the road to Roma, Italy!



Camping Roma! My second home :-) It was definitely nice to be back somewhere familiar, but unfortunately my Roma offsider Rhi had already left on her own trip and so a new site manager there  Nicky! And Scotty who I knew from Training Trip who was in a home-made wheelchair after breaking his leg!



But unfortunately Rome is a very busy site! We dropped the passengers off for their walking tour and then headed to camp to set up the cooktent by ourselves. Never much fun with just a couple of people! And then the rain started! Making it even less fun!! Luckily some passengers off another trip that we had picked up offered to help so it made it a lot quicker. And then it was off to shop! Off to the Metro to jam another billion items onto the bus, head home to unpack them all and meet the group. We had quite a few people we knew in that night so by the time I had had a few drinks at the pool bar with them listening to the band, it was midnight and I couldnt be bothered to do the preparation for breakfast in the morning, thinking I would just get up early and do it then. But my friend Marky Mark convinced me and very kindly spent like an hour making a million toasties with me to cook in the morning. Shattered I went to bed and that is all I remember until I hear a panicked voice next to me  K??? What are you still doing here??!! It is 20 to 7! ARGH!!! I jumped out of bed, threw on whatever was on the floor and bolted as fast as I could to the cooktent. Two passengers were already standing there looking confused as I hurtled past them, ripped open the cooktent door and started organising! Emma and Megan were fantastic passengers who got up early every morning to help me organise breakfast, lunch and packing the cooktent. Whats going on? they asked??! I didnt hear my alarm!! Quickly they got busy cooking the toasties and doing the toast as I set up the remainder of the things just as the passengers started to arrive for breakfast. We tossed out the food as they came and somehow we pulled it off! I had managed to pull off a hot breakfast for 45 in about 15 mins!!!!!!!!!!! How on earth did that happen I have no idea!! I should have been up an hour earlier!!!!!! And thank goodness for the girls!!! And double thank goodness for Marky Mark who had convinced me and helped me to do all the prep the night before. If we hadnt I dread to think what would have happened!!! Nooky told all the passengers later about what had happened and they all laughed in amazement  they had had absolutely no idea which I think was brilliant!

The rain started just as we were finishing breakfast and everyone piled in the cooktent to finish their food and try and stay dry. I passed out garbage bags for those missing raincoats as they pulled them over their heads as the latest fashion accessories and headed out to see Roma!

And another day.............shopping! I headed over the road to Panorama Supermarket and luckily Nooky came back from dropping the group off whilst I was there as I had no idea how I was going to push 2 full trolleys over the overpass back to the campsite alone!

I started the prep for the massive 3 course dinner you cook in Rome and was then convinced to work super quick and head into town to the awesome Spaghetteria I had been to when I lived in Rome with Scotty, Nicky, Marky Mark, Jaz and her boyfriend Matt whose trip we had paralleled most of the way so far. After a lovely lunch it was time to rush back and go crazy making the Bruscetta, Lasagna and Tiramisu for dinner. And the rain had started again as well with vengeance so Nicky had kindly offered the site cooktent for me to use to prepare my meal and serve as well. Which was lucky she didnt have another group in seeing as there was no where else at all we could possibly go!!!

The group were all totally soggy and wet, but had already drowned their sorrows in some Italian wine and were ridiculously jolly throughout the entire meal, washing up and having to mop up the entire cooktent as it all flooded! I have never heard a group so loud! But they were definitely having fun :-).

Our next drive day was off to Venice and as we departed the roads around the campsite were totally flooded! We swished through about half a metre deep water and spent the day driving through the rain, dreading arriving at our next campsite in the rain. Luckily it was clear as we pulled into Camping Alba DOro and set up the tents. The site reps Welshy and my good friend Jarrad (who worked with me at the Orange Tree in London) had said I could use their cooktent and dining room which was awesome news that we didnt have to put up our own cooktent! It was toga part night but after the last few nights in Rome and the general total and utter tiredness of our group we all snuck away early to bed!

The rains started the next morning as the group headed into town wearing their fashion garbage bags again and it was ridiculous!!! It absolutely poured down and Jarrad and I couldnt even see the road out of the car window on the way to the supermarket. We parked underground and the water was just gushing down! Shopping complete and heading back to the campsite the rain continued and we became absolutely drenched as we attempted to unpack. All I can say is lucky I brought gumboots as I sloshed through shin deep water.

And then we drove around to our campers tents... the entire campsite was underwater and the tents were sitting in shin deep water. Their packs were floating inside their tents and everything they owned was saturated. Not a nice surprise to meet you after standing around wet in the rain all day in Venice. To top it all off the bus was also not working and the passengers ended up stranded in town for several hours until Nooky could organise a permit for our bus to go in and collect them.

I felt so sorry for all our passengers, but they were real troopers about the whole situation, pulling down their saturated tents and putting on their swimwear as they dried their clothes in the laundry and all paid to upgrade into cabins to dry themselves off and warm up.... And then headed to the bar to get drunk! We were so lucky we had such good passengers. It was definitely amazing.
 
From Paris to Berlin and every disco I&apos;ve been in.... Part 3 Europe

2009-09-17 to 2009-09-20

Grateful to be out of the river that was once the Venice campsite we begin our journey to Vienna, Austria! The journey is absolutely stunning, driving past mountains of the Alps and just amazing scenery. We did the driving tour of the city and then headed to the campsite where we attempted to dry off the wet tents and mattresses, some ingenious passengers blow drying them off! After dinner it was time for Prater Park!! A brilliant amusement Park here! We went on the Superman Rollercoaster where you fly lying on your stomach which is pretty novel, and this most awful awful ride called something like Ecstasy, but we called it the vomitron I think it was after realising exactly how awful it was. Nooky and I walked past just as some of our passengers were going on so we thought why not?!. We had not seen the ride in motion and we were suddenly flung in circles, upside down in circles constantly in different directions and so fast the gravity would not allow us to move at all. I cannot even describe how awful it was. We couldnt walk straight when we got off, our brains were all shaken inside our heads and we felt sick all night. We later found out that is the ride the office warns you not to go on as it can cause a lot of problems. Well, we definitely learnt our lesson; Never again!!!!!!!!

The next day we dropped the passengers off in Vienna city and headed off to do the shopping. Paddy the driver didnt really want to be doing it and was argumentative and didnt have directions for the supermarket I had asked to go to, but wouldnt let me call back for them. After a long painful morning of driving around and getting nowhere...we finally crashed! Yup! Totally smashed a car going straight ahead when we tried to turn left from the wrong lane at an intersection. I really feel for the poor guy in the car  his life must have flashed before his eyes being crushed by a bus. He was in so much shock when we both stopped, but luckily he was fine  just damage to both our vehicles. But it took ages as my driver stopped being able to think as I found and did all his relevant paperwork and talked to the driver before the police arrived. Finally we were off on our way and ended up having to go to 3 separate supermarkets to try and get all the stuff I needed!! Or should I say I did as I ended up having to do it alone anyway! Ah! So frustrating sometimes. We dropped the goods back at the campsite and headed into town to get our passengers and Nooky for our tour of the Schnapps Museum! It is always a fun tour there that ends in lots of delicious sample shots! Next it was time for some of the passengers to go to the Opera with Nooky whilst we took the rest back to the campsite who then kindly helped me make packed breakfasts for the morning. I consolidated everything in the cooktent into what I needed as I was not able to put it up in Munich. It was pitch dark by then but we somehow managed to pack up everything and put it on the bus, and all our backpacks as we were only using a backpack for the next few days. And as we later discovered left behind one of the corners of the tent and had to gaffa tape it in for the rest of the trip! Oops!

Up at about 4am we packed up the tents and the rest of the stuff as we headed off to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany! We left slightly after 5 which was annoying as our driver had screwed up his hours. As a driver in Europe you have stringent conditions you must adhere to with rest and driving hours and then miscalculating these as well as getting lost the previous day had Nooky and I a little annoyed at him...again! The whole plan was to get a headstart as we were only there for one day!

Luckily enough we managed to make good time as we headed off to Germany. We all had brought white T-shirts and sat on the bus designing our own Bierfest outfits to wear which was heaps of fun. We all began to get excited as we started to pull into Munich, hoping we might make it for the start of the festivities at 12. But unfortunately it was not to be as our driver again got ridiculously lost and we ended up doing laps around the outside of the city for about an hour!!! We were running out of excuses to tell the passengers, but finally we managed to call through to another topdeck driver at the campsite and through Nooky and I finding signs we managed to direct in.

It was awesome as we arrived at Camping Thalkirchen and went into pre set up tents, had a massive reunion with all the other topdeck staff there and then jumped back onto the bus to drop people at the festival and do a walking tour of Munich. Munich is a really cute little city with a couple of really gorgeous churches  even one that has the devils footprint in it in Frauenkirche, Cathedral of Our Blessed Lady! In a version of the legend, the devil made a deal with the church builder - no windows were to be built in the church. The clever builder, however, tricked the devil by positioning columns so that the windows were not visible from the spot where the devil stood in the foyer. When the devil discovered that he had been tricked, he could not enter the already consecrated church. The devil could only stand in the foyer and stomp his foot furiously, which left the dark footprint that remains visible in the church&apos;s entrance today.



We then headed into the Oktoberfest festival, munching on foot long sausages, drinking beers and laughing at how brilliant everyone looked in their traditional German outfits. It was absolutely packed as it was opening day and there was an opening day crew party back at the campsite so we headed back to join the festivities!

It was a fantastic afternoon, catching up with everyone, live music, food and drinks and joining in on a few of the shuttles going into town to pick up all the drunken passengers. However, I was soon told that one of our passengers, Elle had been taken to hospital. It turns out she was swinging on the little merry go round in the playground and leant back. There is a food trailer right next to it and her head smashed into it, split open and she was covered in blood. There was mass confusion as lots of drunken people panicked and went into a thousand different directions to try and find her passport so she could be treated at the hospital. It was a bit of a joke really as it had happened half an hour before and they were still running around like headless chooks and trying to organise people to swap shifts at the hospital with her boyfriend Aaron to bring him back and ridiculous! I just found her tent, walked over and what do you know  there is was in her backpack. I am still stunned how no one could have figured that out! Our Tour Leader was too drunk to do anything and seeing as everyone else was clearly too drunk too drunk as well, one of the drivers took me to the hospital to drop it off and check on her. She was hysterical at the thought she might have to be left behind ( as the tour was leaving the next morning) the poor girl, and they could not give her anything until they had confirmed that she had not fractured her skull. Luckily over the next few hours as I sat there in emergency, she was cleared of a fracture, stitched up, bandaged up and cleaned of blood, but had to be kept in overnight for observation.

It was crazy sitting there watching all the people come in, there were broken legs, broken arms, broken fingers, people who had fallen over and smashed themselves up, people that looked like they were had been in fights, and people that were just so drunk and passed out no one knew what was wrong with them!! Busy time to be in medical care in Munich!! All our passengers had to wear yellow topdeck wristbands to get into the campsite so it was also an easy way to identify them as they were wheeled into the hospital! Another 2 arrived whilst I was there so the Munich site reps tried to find out who they were to get their tour leaders in to help them out!! Ridiculous!!

So many, many, many hours later I arrived back at the campsite as Elle was settled for the night and prepared to head to my tent... I am not sure exactly what had happened, maybe because the ground was wet when the tents were put on, or they were put up in a rush by the ground crew who didnt use the guy ropes, so the fly sat against the tent, the entire tent, mattress, sleeping bag and my belongings were absolutely saturated! Awesome! I just lay there in a huddled ball for a few hours freezing cold and wet until I couldnt take it anymore and just went and sat inside the topdeck cookttent until time to make breakfast!!! SO nasty!!!! I just wanted to have a hot shower  which we couldnt have there as there was no time, no shower tokens, our belongings were all under the bus and go somewhere warm to sleep!!! But was not to be as I stood in front of the gas burners trying to warm up and move my fingers so I could start chopping! I felt sorry for the poor passengers, at least at the other campsites as crew we had a cabin so had escaped most of the flooding, but those poor guys  everywhere we went!! Luckily again they were good sports about it, but most of them had to dress in their Oktoberfest clothes again the next morning as they were the driest thing they had and we were going to Dachau concentration camp...so not the most appropriate thing ever!!!

Dachau was much smaller compared to Auschwitz that I had visited last trip, but some parts were definitely equally as moving as you could walk through the actual death chambers and the gas chambers or shower rooms where the victims were gassed to death, see their awful cramped living conditions and ablutions and see a museum and movie about when the camp was operational.
 
From Paris to Berlin and every disco I&apos;ve been in.... Part 4 Europe

2009-09-21 to 2009-09-26

We were all very tired and looking forward to getting on towards Kemp Dzban in Prague. Whilst talking on the mike, about to arrive at the supermarket Nooky thought it might be a good idea if instead of dropping me off to do the shopping we gave all the passengers who wanted to help an item to buy. It probably could have worked if she had warned me, but instead we were then dropped off whilst I had 20 passengers crowding around me what can I get now what can I get now?!! And then trying to check the things they threw in the trolley. I had a non wheat eater so asked for a wheat free cereal, such as corn flakes. I had to send the cereal back three times...and that was the driver! Wheat puffs, muesli, arghh!!!!!!!!!!! The passengers were really really good and really helpful but it was such a shitfight! But we survived, and in the end I only had to get a few extra things to top up the next day!

There was an option for an upgrade here to cabins and a lot of the group did this before we had dinner at camp and totally hit the sack! Next morning we all headed in for a walking tour. We saw the beautiful famous medieval astronomical clock on the Old Town City Hall in the Old Town Square, Charles Bridge and all the gorgeous old buildings in the city.

Nooky and I then went and did all the grocery shopping and dropped it back off at the campsite before heading back into town again to meet our group for dinner. We found this really cool restaurant  Skorepka (www.skorepka.cz ) that did really nice traditional Czech food for really reasonable prices so had a great dinner there, with most of the group eating the famous pork knuckle! I tried some of the smoked one  delicious! I was quite surprised it was so good! Very fatty though, but once you eat around it  surprisingly good! We hit a few little bars in different places, but most of us were so shattered and headed back early ready for the next mornings departure.

Off to Berlin, Germany! Camping Kleinmachnow is over an hour from the city  in fact, it is actually outside Berlin! Which is a shame as the campsite is really quite pretty located alongside a river. Unfortunately the campsite is set out in a long line and we camp right at the end. The toilets are right near the beginning and so are a massive walk to get there!!! We always joke that we will be doing shuttles to ferry the passengers there! :-)

Setting up camp, we then jumped back onto the bus for our driving tour of Berlin before we headed to the Happy Pig restaurant for our dinner and Karaoke night, lots of fun as usual!



The next morning I was excited as I love Berlin and had managed to structure my day so I could participate in the Third Reich Walking tour with the group. It was a fantastic tour, seeing the site of Hitlers old bunker, which is now a carpark! The Jewish memorial, the Brandenburg Gate, Hotel Adlon where Michael Jackson dangled his baby off the balcony, the Reichstag (Parliament), and a little shop where some of our group managed to find old gas masks and proceeded to make as laugh non stop as they finished the walking tour wearing them! We also saw original watch towers from the old wall, Checkpoint Charlie, the old allied gateway from east to west and the Berlin wall. It was absolutely brilliant! I only wish I could remember half of what we were told!!!



I then walked around the gorgeous city and dropped in at the Ampelmann store - it is the symbolic person shown on traffic lights at pedestrian crossings in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR - East Germany). Prior to the German reunification in 1990, the two German states had different forms for the Ampelmann, with a generic human figure in West Germany, and a generally male figure wearing a hat in the east.



It was then time to meet Nooky to finish the shopping, find our driver and head back to camp! By this stage everyone was starting to get sick so we were all fingers crossed it wouldnt get us!!

And on the road to our last city!! Amsterdam!! Along the way we stopped at the Cheese and Clogs demonstration and a windmill to see some of the most famous things in Holland! After all the crappy weather we had had, there was a unanimous decision on the bus to pay to upgrade from our campsite to a hostel in Amsterdam and so instead of heading out to Camping Zeeburg, we landed instead at the Hans Brinker Hostel in the middle of Amsterdam! This made life so easy for me as instead of having to make all the meals, I had allocated money from the food budget to give to the hostel for this!! Woohoo!! So I finally had some free time to explore Amsterdam!!! The first night we did the walking tour and headed through the red light district o the sex show, which as usual shocked everyone!

It was so awesome being able to walk around the city, which you never get to do on a camping trip and so we also dropped into a few bars around the corner from our hostel. The next day we started out with the bike tour that departed from just near our hostel  it is one of my favourite things to do on all the trips! I love cycling around Amsterdam!! Whilst we were out we also saw one of the cranes in operation moving someone in and out of a flat. As the houses in Amsterdam are really narrow and with many stories, it is near impossible to move into them, so each have a little crane on the top which are used to move all the furniture in and out of the balconies! Cool hey!



Then finally tried the Febo - it is basically a fast food place where there are clear little boxes with food, such as fried Dutch snacks, hamburgers or anything else equally as nasty, along the walls, you put in your money, open the door and a hot fried greasy snack! Yup, Gross!!!! I then walked around everywhere before it was time to head back to the hotel and dress up like a pirate for our final dinner at the Sea Palace in Amsterdam  a Chinese restaurant. I have no idea why we go there, but it is a floating restaurant so really quite nice and super handy as the boat for our canal cruise leaves from there. We were lucky this time  all our group made it to dinner after managing to hold themselves back from overindulging in the brownies, hash cookies and everything else that Amsterdam has to offer!



After a great canal cruise, where we also performed our trip theme song From Paris to Berlin we hit the nightclub district to dance the night away, before I was woken up about 4am by one of our passengers who had eaten too many brownies and alcohol and was having heart palpitations. Luckily Nooky offered to take her to hospital, and all was okay so that was all good.



And our last day! As we had nothing to pack up and were leaving earlier, we decided to go via Belgium and drop into the cute little city of Brugge on the way home, with lots of old buildings, and lots of stores with lollies, Belgium chocolates, fries and also the famous waffles which are really quite good!



And then to the dock! It was time to drop all the passengers off at Calais as Paddy and I took the bus back to the depot in Wembledinge, Holland to unpack, drop off all our equipment and then head back to the crew house to sleep! Our transport manager Andy is a total idiot and decided to attempt to make me clean out all the tents, but luckily I already had my train ticket so I managed to escape the wrath of his nastiness again!
 
Beersteins and sausages - an introduction to Oktoberfest, Munich, Germany

2009-09-27 to 2009-10-04

After managing to pick up a bargain with my train tickets if I left on a certain day, I bid farewell to the Crew House and the beautiful Wembledinge and began my journey. Catching the bus from outside our house, I arrived in our nearest big town  Goes (said Hoos) and waited for my train. I caught the train to Amsterdam and then sat backpack style in the middle of Amsterdam waiting for my train to Munich! It was leaving about 8pm and I was looking forward to a nice reclining seat and sleep. But alas no! The fluro lights stayed on all light in the carriage and with stopping about every hour it was not the most restful ride in the world!



I arrived at Munich train station at the crack of dawn ridiculously tired and headed out to Camping Thalkirchen, the Topdeck site. It was really quite chilly and I was glad to find out that there was a spare bed in the Doubledecker crew bus that I was able to sleep in for the duration! Yay!



Anouk (Nooky), my tour leader from my last trip and I had decided that it would be nice to head down to Oktoberfest as we liked to call it  a bierfest holiday! As we were going to stay with Topdeck and help out the ground crew there we got to hang out with all our crew mates there and stay and eat for free!

Nooky had caught the bus from London and just arrived before I so I grabbed some breakfast and got settled in. There were also two other boys from our last trip on the bus Dan and Ben which was great! There wasnt much going on and so I headed into Munich for the afternoon to wander around and buy a dirndl! The dirndl consists of a bodice, blouse, full skirt and apron, and is the outfit you think of when you picture Oktoberfest! The boys all wear Lederhosen knee-breeches (knickerbockers or shorts) made of leather. As I headed back to camp, I noticed hundreds of people standing outside the campground, sitting down and lying in the park next to the river. Turnsout that the previous night one of the girls in the campsite (it was full to capacity with thousands of people) had allegedly been raped. It was now 1pm and in some kind of very weird response the police had just turned up and evacuated the entire campsite. Even though we were positive the person who had done it would have been long gone by now! And so we were banned from the campsite as police dogs were brought in, about 17 police cars, the police chopper flew overhead, several tow trucks and cranes, and journalists in what I like to call the biggest and craziest response I have ever seen! Of course they did not find anything, but it took them over 3 hours before anyone was allowed back in again! Luckily there was a lovely pub on the river down the road so after realising that it was going to be a while we just walked down there to wait of news of the campsite reopening!!



We then had an awesome afternoon and evening, catching the bus into the Bier Halls, going on the rollercoaster and drinking Steins of surprisingly delicious beer! The bierhalls which I hadnt managed to get into on the opening day when I was last there as they were too packed were much free-er now, although still quite busy! The um pa pa bands were there in the middle, there were lights and lots of pretty decorations and everyone was singing and dancing along and having a great time!!

Our group all got split up and Nick and I ended up in a small local bierhall having a great time chatting with the locals, playing coaster tricks, drinking Steins and singing along standing on our bench seats. But all too soon it was time to go and it was a mad race through the festival to manage to catch the last bus home.



The next few days were filled with catching up with staff as they came through on different trips, getting up and helping with breakfast, doing dishes and various work shifts such as meet and greet at the front gate to show people arriving where the Topdeck tents were, and also the desk at the cooktent where you would allocate everyone to their tent and tell them all the details that they needed to know for their trip.



Breakfast was one of my favourite parts  the music went on really loud and everyone was happy and chatty and dancing and singing along. The blackeyed peas song  Tonights gonna be a good night was the theme song and each day it was on we would all have to yell &quot;mozeltoff&quot; really loudly and dance around. If you were on hot food duty you would have to wait for the lids off! command before you could take this off, and the lids on! to replace this, all three of you together, as fast as you could with your hands in the air prove your speed at the finish. We sung happy birthday to the birthday people each day and applauded and cheered each morning as number 69 came into the breakfast tent. Each person had a number written on their hands so we knew how many we had served and to make sure the didnt come back through again. It was all a good laugh and we had a lot of fun there.



It was all a fantastic atmosphere and good fun, but we also did a lot of work  I probably went into Bierfest just twice when I was there, due to the different work shifts that we had to do as acting ground crew and probably due to the fact as well I was already in the first stages of swine flu :-).



Each time I went into Bierfest it still excited me, driving through the city and then seeing out of nowhere this massive fair ground full of lights, rides, halls and a massive atmosphere. It also had this massive swing ride, just like the swings that you used to go on when you were little that spun you in circles... but this one did it about 50m up in the air over the festival!! It was actually really quite scary, and it didnt help to have smart ass Nick sitting next to me making comments such as wow, its really high, these chains are so flimsy and the like!



Another day, Voodoo who was the equipment manager there had what he called a shed party where straight after breakfast we all just sat around in his shed drinking and chatting all day! Like the equivalent of a lazy Sunday afternoon bbq...without the bbq. :-)



Steincoolers (http://steincoolers.com/ ) which is just like a stubby cooler, but for Biersteins! Were being sold for the first year and were invented by a couple of the guys from Topdeck - Scottie and Schmiko. They wanted to do some advertising so one day got all the girls out wearing nothing but Steincoolers for the promo shots! It was hilarious! Im not sure it helped sell any more, but I can categorically say Steincoolers are not the most comfortable or practical outfit in the world!





During the week that we were there, there were terrorist threat against Oktoberfest. This made the situation of getting in and out very tricky as there were roadblocks set up around the entire festival and each bus had to be stopped and checked each time it went through. Now bearing in mind that the campsite had about 4 different companies buses just doing trips around and around picking up and dropping off patrons all day each day, this was very painful and turned a 20 min trip into well over an hour as we sat there in the queues waiting to be checked. Luckily however nothing did happen and we were all able to just enjoy ourselves!



The campsite was also totally packed to excess! There was no toilet paper supplied at all as it would have been a ridiculous constant effort to keep enough in there and probably would have sent them broke as well! And as the massive amount of people that went through them each day they were far from clean! I think at midday each day they got a power hose, hosed them out and just figured they would clean them once everyone had gone!! And the queuing for showers! Ridiculous! I know people that showered once the entire time we were there as it was so much hassle! It was SO cold as well- you had to also queue at the reception for ages to get a shower token for hot water. The common pick up line used by drunk boys everywhere was I have a shower token, want to share it with me?! Not sure how successful it was, but it definitely summed up the situation nicely!



As everyone started to depart the massive job of taking down all the tents ensued. We found an assortment of various items left behind  sleeping bags, socks, clothes, shoes, towels, a foot brace?! And a few other equally as random things. We also had the lovely job of sometimes finding spewed on mattresses from those who celebrated a little too hard! Yuck! I am pleased to say those went straight to the bin!



It took ages though, taking down the guy ropes, pulling the pegs, pulling the fly off, putting that out to dry, shaking out the tent, cleaning off the groundsheet. Ugh! I was definitely glad when that chore was over!



As we were quite close to the fairytale castle that the Disney Castle is based on - Neuschwanstein Castle - Nooky, I and a few other girls from the Topdeck crew, Jodie, Elle and Loz arranged to get a hire car to drive out! Nooky and I almost didnt make it in the end as we had been rostered on to work when we had asked for the time off. We rushed through breakfast and then were told if we pulled down all the tents we could have off until our next shift on the meet and greet at the front gate at 7pm. After spending ages sorting pegs into lots of 18 we were finally free and ran to meet the others. It was a few hours drive there, but it was really pretty as we arrived and queued to get our ticket...and hit our first hurdle! We had missed the midday tour and the next one wasnt until late that afternoon. Calculating the time we had and the time we needed to get back it was going to be touch and go... but we decided we hadnt come all this way for nothing! We got the tickets and walked around the pretty little town.



Walking down to Forggensee Lake it was such a beautiful day we hired paddleboats and paddled around, admiring the amazing view. We then caught a bus up the mountain and walked the last part of the way to the castle! And it was definitely really very cool!!! Inside was just amazing as well. So gorgeous and a really nice tour  but unfortunately no photos were allowed!



But then it was over! And time to hurry! We ran out and back down the hill, into the car and hit the road!!!! We rushed home and arrived at the campsite ready to take our post just as the clock hit 7pm. Phew, we had made it!





But everything all over also meant that it was time to depart! And so saying a sad farewell to all my Topdeck crew buddies I boarded the bus for the massive trip that we were about to undertake - leaving Munich, Germany to drive through the night to arrive at the ferry dock in Calais, France in the morning, catch the ferry to Dover, England and then arrive back into London!! Nasty!!!!
 
The billion hour journey to Palmerston North, New Zealand... and Grandma&apos;s 90th Birthday!

2009-10-04 to 2009-10-24

Okay I know you have heard this before but i will be updating soon! I am currently &apos;trapped&apos; in Palmerston North until I am off my death bed - doctors orders! So fingers crossed will be able to get updated! Not exactly sure yet what I have... thinks it to be glandular and some other random muscle and organ thing, but all okay! As long as i sleep for like 20 hours a day!! Actually I am not kidding, but I am all good - will start my updates tomorrow! k xxx



So I boarded the bus out of Munich on 4th Oct, drove overnight to catch the ferry from Calais, France and arrived in Dover to drive back into London 24 hours later. The bus dropped off at the Topdeck offices and I sat there killing a few hours, in desperate need of a shower and sleep before it was time to jump on the tube and head to the airport to catch my flight to NZ! I pity anyone that tried to have a conversation with my that day for I was sure I was not making any sense at all.. and even more I pity those that were going to have to be trapped sitting next to me on the flight! And to be honest I dont even remember anything about it! I am sure I stopped over somewhere, but nope, to tired to register any of it! ...But then, finally, on the 7th Oct I arrived, 3 days after I had left, feeling like death, sleep deprived beyond belief, desperately ready for the shower and bleary eyed trying to find public transport when a familiar face stepped in front of me -my wonderful cousin Darrin had managed to pick me upI have never been so pleased to see anyone in my life! Meeting Uncle Peter and my mum on the way I finally made it to Grandmas!!

The next day the family started to arrive bit by bit until the following day when it was an awesome full house! It was so good to see all the family again and so good to have so many people there to help Grandma celebrate! As tradition holds we all got fish and chips from around the corner and all ate it out of the paper! Ahhh :-)

We even met some distant cousins from the UK- Paul and Sarah who had come out for the celebrations which was really cool.

The older cousins all decided to hit the town in downtown Palmie and came across a little Irish pub with a live band which was quite nice, even meeting randomly a guy from Sydney who was over for his Grandmas 90th birthday that weekend too! Bizarre! We had to watch Colin and Len though who had their eyes for some of the Pubs decorations! As the night continued I decided to head home... only to be confronted with the most awful wind, and ridiculously hard sideways rain!! I hesitated but there was nothing that could be done and bravely faced it! And yes...nightmare!! I was walking forward with all my might and just getting about a quarter of a pace each time as the wind blew at me and the rain pelted down. And boy was it cold!!! I somehow made it home and sank against the door.. oh oh. Someone had locked the wrong door and I was locked out!!!!!!!!! I stared up at the sky as the wind swirled what looked ridiculously like snow around me. It was October!!! Unbelievable! I later found out that the Desert Road had been closed cause of snow as well so it might well have been!

I knocked, but no response and so headed outside my safe alcove to the back of the house, squishing through freezing cold ankle deep water as I attempted to traverse the backyard and garden to the room I knew was occupied. Mum! I called. No response, not surprisingly really considering the howling wind, pelting rain and banging shutters! Muuuuuuuuuuum!! Mum, Can you let me in, please!!! Soon a voice responded. Karinya? The keys outside. I stood there in the freezing rain. I know. I replied, But you guys locked the wrong door!!! All of the sudden it dawned and luckily soon enough I was trying to ward off the hypothermia. Thank goodness!!! Christine, a German border currently living with my Uncle was also in the room and as she told me later apparently I quite creeped her out thinking I was a ghost or something!!



The next day luckily dawned without the rainclouds to help us celebrate Grandmas 90th birthday! It was an awesome day as again the whole family, and more arrived to enjoy the day! We had delicious nibbles and then a fantastic lunch before all cramming into a massive group family photo outside which took ages for the poor photographer to try and get together! We also did a re-creation photo of the family from Grandma and Grandads 50th wedding anniversary which was 19 years ago. A massive change  about 20 people compared to the about 80 now! Brilliant!!

A lady organised by Uncle Kevin had also come around to play guitar and sing all the old favourites and everyone had a fantastic time singing along, or just watching all the oldies enjoy themselves! Before she left Don stole the guitar and had the kids mesmerized with his renditions of songs and someone started an ice down the shirt fight!



Another brilliant tradition, we all packed up into the cars and headed down to the Esplanade, an amazing park a few minutes drive away and spent the afternoon on the massive flying fox (which almost hit the ground under the weight of Colin and Don!!!), hamster wheels, trampolines, spinning swings and all sorts of amazing fun things. I think we were all lucky to escape unscathed from this little adventure as we watched all the boys go onto the spinning type swing, then people push them and before we knew what had happened there was a MASSIVE disaster, a collision of epic proportions as everyone ended up on the ground, jumping off the swings or just trying to escape! Hilarious!!



Back with all the family to celebrate Grandmas 90th birthday was fantastic, but I just couldnt shake my tiredness and after the party spent the entire time in bed! I didnt get out of bed for entire days, and then spent the rest of the time bouncing between health professionals and attempting to walk several metres which was an epic epic mission. I was finally dubiously diagnosed with glandular fever and told I needed to change my flight and sleep. And so I tried, but didnt seem to be getting anywhere. I unfortunately could not visit any of the family I had wanted to during my trip, or do anything with the family that was around as I was just so sick.

I jumped on a naked bus http://nakedbus.com/ and headed up north to Whangerai to crash at a friend  Nicks - house for a while and try and recoup! It was awesome chilling, hanging out out and watching movies and I thought that slowly I might be getting somewhere! And so headed back to Auckland to my cousin Len and Kayes to say Hi before I got a flight out. Kaye so kindly picked me up from town and took me home to sit on the couch, shattered from the journey. Hmm not as well as I had hoped! I spent the next few days trying desperately to get out of bed, almost convincing myself I was well, but as lovely as it was to be with my family, and as brilliant as they were all helping me out, it just felt like I was biding time and not getting anywhere with my health, and wondering if this was as well as I was going to get I headed to the airport and back to London Town with fingers crossed!
 
Yep, looks like you have Swine Flu! London, England

2009-10-25 to 2009-10-31

Leaving NZ, I arrived in Sydney and finally over an hour of standing around the luggage arrived I was ready to head outside to meet Bern, Jas and Mum who had all come to the terminal to say Hi.



I loaded a trolley up with everything we had and then me and had everyone laugh at us as Jas pushed the trolley out of the airport, down the street and all the way to his work carpark. Sunshine and summer, it was a beautiful day as we had a delicious Vietnamese lunch before it was time to re-check in for my flight to London. I was also excited about traveling for the first time on the new A380, the airbus and it was a really cool plane, much more spacious, and, most importantly the entertainment system worked from the minute you got in, you didn&apos;t have to wait until you were airborne, nice!!



I had a Indian family sitting next to me, but they got off in Singapore so had the whole row until some random chick decided to sit next to me! damn her!! Mid flight she also got ill so i was praying i didn&apos;t catch anything else!!!



Arriving into I received some bad news that a family member had passed away, then found the London the tube line was down, but luckily there were ever helpful station personnel to send clueless passengers in several different directions and not get anywhere at all! Finally I figured we had to catch the train, 3 different tube lines and 3 hours later I made it to the hostel! Not so fun!! Clearly I was still ridiculously sick and so exhausted slept for 2 days until I met my old room-mate Tash from The Orange Tree when I worked in London for lunch.



We headed to another friends - Dan&apos;s- pub, the White Horse in Shenley and had a great day... then I slept for another day until I moved back into the crackhouse, the staff house from the pub that my old workmates kindly offered so I could save some money! Not able to get out of bed again I slept for another day again until met a uni friend, Babs who has also been backpacking around the world which was awesome to swap stories. Feeling more like death I crawled back and slept for another day until I could get a doctors appointment, and headed up the road. I saw the doc and they decided I needed more blood tests! more! ahhhh! And then decided that they should call an ambulance and put me in hospital. Malaria..... Glandular..... Meningitis..... who knows they said!! So I was quite out of it and dont remember exactly but 2 different paramedic teams were there and there was an ambulance ride which apparently ended up in one of the wards of Barnet Hospital. Then more sleeping in between more blood being taken, 3 different very very painful attempts to get a drip into my arm, swabs down my throat, more x-rays where I was put into a mask, wheeled aimlessly through the hospital, sat in a corridor for a while and then found out that the request hadn&apos;t even be put through and then left some more! And then told constantly that I was really dehydrated and that I should drink more... lucky i didn&apos;t hold my breath as I am still waiting for the water to arrive! :+)



Finally a few different doctors came in, tried to figure it all out, gave me some drugs and I was wheeled into a ward, left for a bit, then wheeled to another ward and then back as it was not ready, then around 1am wheeled again! The next morning I was woken up by people tapping on the glass door and staring at me as they did the rounds for the oncoming staff. Later that day the door opened and someone came in, covered in plastic, plastic gloves and mask to give me more drugs, take obs and take a food order. And I was starving! Turns out I was in the isolation ward and so the food staff couldnt come in! Not that it mattered anyway as the entire time I was there they asked me what I wanted to eat off the menu and then they brought me whatever they wanted to anyway! And disgusting!!! I like to think that I eat most things now, but even I could not even force down the sludge that came! Grooooooooss!! Apparently paper is hard to come by as well as all the obs were written down on napkins!! The doctors came in, all plasticed and masked up and asked how I was. Luckily, the combination of the drip, and drugs were helping and i felt a lot better than in ages. Turns out I was on Tamiflu, and they wern&apos;t exactly sure what I had; but yeah, its probably swineflu, they just dont bother testing if there are symptoms, they just treat. Guess that last swine flu swab test they took was lost somewhere as well! They said I was to stay until the end of the course of tamiflu- 3 more days and then left.



The shower was also full of chairs, coathangers and random metal structures...not that it mattered anyway as they didnt provide a towel! lovely! By 11am the next day I was starving, over being in hospital, had not even seen any medical staff whatsoever since the previous afternoon even though I had pressed the buzzer hours before! Finally a harried looking guy came in who had absolutely no idea what he was doing, it was his first day from a temp agency, couldnt take the obs, I had to tell him what medication I should have had like 3 hours ago and what to do. Finally several hours later I was caught up, over the hospital and ready to be discharged and so told the doctor when he came in. Luckily several hours later again after having been in isolation and having people in plastic and masks treat me, they just opened the door, I walked out and continued on with my day. weird. But not a moment too soon for my sanity! Soooo, on a scale of 1-10 of awfulness, I would say about an 11... All I can say is thank goodness the National Health Service is free!! Yes, I may have also been advised not to go to Egypt 2 days later as per my plan, but they did say i was no longer contagious, and after not being able to get any $$ back from the trip on such short notice and in desperate need of some sunshine I decided, well, you cant catch what you already have! ...And the hospitals in Egypt couldn&apos;t be worse than England....could they??!! :+) I spent the next 2 days sleeping and crossing fingers that I would get better... Egypt here i come!



A little PS to this blog I wrote at the time, looking back on it from a few months later! -

It was definitely a really tough few months, I basically spent 2 months in bed, out of it! and the first few weeks in Egypt were also really tough. Overall it took me well over another 2 months to really feel better and I am still taking it day by day. I never remember ever feeling so sick in all my life, but it has just made me finally really realise how important your health is! It was a really tough month as my father also passed away, but luckily I had some amazing friends for which I am eternally grateful xxxx .



I don&apos;t think I really realised just quite how sick I was at the time, but then again I am not exactly sure what I would/could do differently, you just try and do what you have to! But it has certainly given me a much better perspective on life and health and what I need to do for myself and I will really try and watch myself and be careful. If not, i think probably just looking back on this blog and remembering how sick I was and how awful I felt should do the trick!
 
Made from wood and covered in gold - The story of ancient Egypt! Part 1

2009-11-01 to 2009-11-21


Waking at 5am, I was trying to be super quiet as my room mate Andy started laughing, turns out be had just gone to bed! Another house mate Pete walked in the door and I remembered how glad I was I no longer worked the nocturnal life! As it was too early for the tube and with weekend line &apos;improvement&apos; work, I jumped in the cab, picked up Jarrad and we headed to Heathrow to randomly run into our fellow travel buddies as we walked in! Handy! A group of us that had done the topdeck training trip together at the start of the season had decided to do a 3 week topdeck tour of Egypt.

We were flying BMI airlines and were slightly worried about our lives as we shook from side to side heading down the runway, but that was the last thing I remember as I managed to sleep for the next 5 hours! Half an hour before landing I took some panadol ready to lower my body temperature to ensure I got through the swine flu heat sensors at Cairo airport!

The airport was an interesting set up as we queued at the bank to pay for our visas before heading through to meet our guide. We jumped on the minibus and began to brave the crazy beeping mess that is cairo traffic. We drove in one of about 5 lanes of traffic jammed down the highway, passing horse and carts, donkeys, people walking, vans with their boots open to avoid the engines overheating and then through the darkness saw the silhouettes of the pyramids towering above the entire city. so awesome! Apparently you always need to leave hours early in Cairo as often the traffic is so bad it takes you quadruple the time to get anywhere! About an hour and a half later we arrived at our Hotel, the Swiss Inn and found a rooftop bar and pool overlooking the entire city, the River Nile and pyramids! Not badfor a bunch of backpackers! :+)

Early the next morning the entire group ha arrived, 9 topdeckers (Me, Jarrad, Allira, Michelle, Al, Sammy, Poo, Scotty and Marty) and another couple from Brissie, (Jo and Trev, or GI as we called him), and with our guide Groova Hamada we boarded the bus to head to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. King Tutankhamen&apos;s golden mask, his jewelery collection, hundreds of ancient relics, and a room full of mummified animals that were so well preserved you could see the creases on the crocodiles toes were all here. We also found the main ancient Egyptian beautification process..... &apos;made from wood and covered in gold&apos;! As we saw burial chambers, chariots, ceremonial beds and wore told this phrase about a million times...maybe more! And as it turns out the majority of relics not in the museum were all taken by the British and are housed in the British Museum in London.

About 2 hours crazy driving later we arrived in Giza to see the Pyramids which were built by the Pharaohs, the Great Pyramid is the grandfathers&apos;, the second pyramid is the fathers&apos; and the smallest pyramid is the sons&apos; as they were not allowed to be built larger than the grandfathers,

The top of the Great Pyramid is missing, but to show its actual height, an A frame has been erected on top to 149m. The two larger pyramids were both covered in a shiny white coating which used to make the pyramids shine, but it has pretty much all been taken. The smallest pyramid was covered in red granite from the Aswan valley, about 300km to the south... we saw it was alien help that managed to get it here :+).

We drove past a curious mix of camels, horses, donkeys, locals, tourists and buses to see all three pyramids from a distance before heading inside the second pyramid. The tunnels were about a metre high and on quite steep angles so we had to bend over and try not to slip as we walked down then up and across, inside to the middle of the pyramid which held the sarcophagus in a room which was really high and only about 5m by 10m across and really difficult to breathe as the air was sooooooooooooooooooo stale.

As we walked around outside we were stalked by locals trying to buy us for camels which was quite funny and we started a competition to see who could get the most! 10 000 seemed to be the highest going rate!

The Sphinx is actually a few minutes drive from the pyramids so we jumped out, saw the wishing well, the collapsed temple and got one of the most famous views in the world with the Sphinx in front of the Great Pyramid :+).

Finally it was lunch time!!! Only about 4pm! Ahhh, our first encounter with Egyptian time, meaning never what it should! :+) And had a great feast of local foods on a buffet before seeing how original paper was made from the papyrus plant being stripped and soaked and pressed into a criss cross pattern that was then used as a canvas.

Finally it was time for bed and I had made it through Egpyt day 1 without getting any sicker! woohoo!

After having done nothing for so many weeks I was shattered so was pleased to find we had a free day in Cairo to chill out on the rooftop and relax. Our hotel was out of the city and in a really local area. Walking around later through the streets we were like the pied piper as we had dozens of local kids following us around and chatting with us in Arabic, before they were sent home by other well meaning adults for being too far from home and bothering us!

With 9 of us crashing in our one allocated room, we headed out at 9pm to catch the bus to the train station. Our train was supposed to be at 10pm, so we killed time by playing games at the station whilst the locals laughed at us! And waited and waited and waited.... until 1145pm when the train arrived! Got to love Egyptian time! We were in 6 seater rooms which was nice and quite easy to sleep in. The train had a toilet that opened straight out onto the tracks and by the end of the journey was covered in an inch of water that sloshed around everywhere as the train moved. nice!! Even nicer was that you can still smoke everywhere inside in Egypt so it definitely totally stunk and if you went into the corridor at the wrong time you walked into a fog. lovely!

It was supposed to be a 12 hour journey south to Aswan, but Egyptian time turned this into about 14 hours as we finally pulled in after 3pm! Luckily the hotel was close and we managed to shower before walking from the pool deck of the hotel onto the boat that was waiting for us on the River Nile to take us to a local Nubian village for dinner.

The Egyptian government moved the Nubian people to their current locations in about the 60&apos;s from their original land as they wanted to build a dam that would consequently flood out their villages. Their houses have rounded tops to minimise the desert heat and are all brightly coloured. Here we had a lesson in the local school on how to speak Nubian and then walked through the town for a traditional local dinner. We started with a delicious chicken noodle soup, had noodles and rice mixed together,sweet potato chips, eggplant moussaka, veges with a tomato sauce done in a tagine (clay cooking pot), kofta (lamb minced meat logs), chicken, and a egg white and grass dip followed by fruit. Apart from the grass dip (which was predictably super gross :+) ) it was amazing!!!

Crocs are quite prevalent in the Nile and so we had a look at 2 that are kept in the village, before the guy placed it on my head!!! It didnt like it so much though as it gripped its claws in. Definitely ow!! Sheisha and henna tattoos followed before our boat ride home. I got my name in Arabic around my wrist which i thought was pretty cool at the nice.... not so much 2 weeks later when it was still there, I was trying to avoid talking to shopkeepers and they can all just read my name!

The next morning at 0245h we were woken up to join up with a convoy to cross the desert to head to Abu Simbel temples. There had been previous rebel attacks so the only way to complete the 3 hour drive across the desert was to travel in a police convoy.

We arrived at the temples built by King Ramses II for himself and his favourite wife. Ramses II reined for about 60 years! After this time, the temples were buried and not rediscovered again until the 1800&apos;s. At this point they then had to be relocated so they were not destroyed in the making of dam by the Egyptian government. Over a period of years, the temples were slowly deconstructed and moved about 60m further up the hill. It was absolutely amazing to think how this managed to be completed without damaging any of the massive statues or delicate engravings. At this time when progress was being made across the country there were various temples and other significant landmarks that required to be moved. The way it worked was whoever paid the money to have this completed got the landmark. As a result there are various temples etc relocated all around the world from Egypt!

But the temples of Ramses II are definitely amazing! One of my favourite places that we have seen for sure. Giant statues adorn the entrances and inside all the walls in all the various chambers are all elaborately carved.

The convoy back through the desert proved why we travel in convoy as our van started making strange noises and we broke down by the side of the road in the middle of the desert .......nowhere! We fashioned some kind of toilet structure from a sleeping bag to protect us from passing cars as we waited for another in our convoy to catch us and help us on our way. The bus that caught us was full of spanish tourists who spent the entire time yelling at their driver for stopping!!

Luckily it did not take us long for us to be on our way again and we arrived back at our hotel to relax by the pool overlooking the Nile. ahhhhhh! We were right across the road from the Aswan markets so we walked through to be offered camels left right and centre!

Egyptian food is also really good too, lots of fresh food and veggies so we headed off for a massive feast.... and unfortunately the ensuing delhi belly that followed for half the group! Welcome to Egypt!

 
Made from wood and covered in gold - The story of ancient Egypt! Part 2

2009-11-10 to 2009-11-19


A delicious final breakfast buffet in our Aswan hotel, it was time to step off the pool deck onto our felucca - the traditional egyptian sailing boat that was to be home for the next 4 days. The entire surface was covered in a wooden deck and mattress and pillows and a large canvas &apos;roof&apos; and we lazed about on the boat and watched the world go by as we sailed down the Nile. Hamada gave us an Arabic lesson and we learnt the most important words we were to use over the course of the trip to random strangers who totally loved it:
salam–hello
ma&apos;a salama- goodbye
habibi–my love
emshe- go away
fil mish mish–in your dreams! (very handy!!!)
la! - no!

Our felucca crew cooked us delicious egyptian meals at random times, sometimes breakfast at 7, sometimes 10. Lunch at 12 or half past 3 so we were either famished or not hungry at all! There was no toilet or anything on board so you had to plan well ahead and tell the captain so we could slowly sail the boat across the river until he found a bank we could dock against with some trees!

Stopping on the local &apos;beach&apos; on the side of the river for a swim, local kids rode up on a donkey, started talking to us and convinced me to go for a ride on their donkey. I will say it was definitely not the most comfortable ride ever!

At night we pulled up to the bank, set up our plank to carefully walk across from the boat to dry land and had a campfire on the beach with sheisha, the flavoured tobacco you smoke out of a water pipe and the crew singing and playing drums for us.

It was surprising how clean the Nile was as well, especially considering the number of boats that go up and down it each day! And such a strong current a well.... Only about 10 metres off the beach and you could easily be swept away!

Sailing past an awesome looking temple, we stopped off at the bank and walked about 2 mins up to Kom Ombo temple, the temple is dedicated to 2 gods, the crocodile god of death and Horus, the falcon god. The temple was built as the ancient Egyptians always needed to cross the Nile but there were so many crocodiles they had to kill to ensure safe passage they thought it would anger the gods. Therefore they dedicated half the temple to the crocodile god to placate him!

There are still remains of colours on the temple from when it was painted 3000 years ago! There is also one of the oldest and I think the only full Egyptian calender which was pretty cool. A well in the complex was also very important at the time as it indicated the water level of the Nile which would indicate how much taxes could be charged as crop production would be high or low. In a drought when the river was low and the well was empty, less taxes were taken.

It was a super hot day and no wind and we almost died as we lay on the boat in the middle of the river without being able to sail anywhere. The next day was the same and we couldn&apos;t make it to our destination. Stuck in the middle of the Nile we jumped off the back and swam in the middle of the river as cruise boats sailed past and waved at us jealously! It was awesome!!!! We finally made it to a bank, docked up and waited for our boat captain to bring a motorised boat to pull us up the river to dock for the night ready for the completion of our 3 night felucca journey the next morning.

We drove about an hour to Edfu temple which is the largest and best preserved temple of Ancient Egypt today. And it was massive!!!!!! Inside in the olden days you gave your request to the priest who would ask the question to the gods and then yell the answer out. ie. if i marry so and so will we be happy?! It was soooooooooooooooooo hot here as well! and the guide was really good, loved his job and wanted to pass his knowledge to us but it was tooo hot to take it in as we walked around the temple for over an hour and a half with what felt like the rest of the entire worlds tourists!!

The temple was dedicated to Horus, the falcon god and there were 2 stairways to the roof, the up one was a spiral indicating the way that falcons soar to altitude and the down straight showing how the bird flies straight down which I thought was pretty cool attention to detail!

As the temple was also used by the Greeks and romans after the Egyptians, underground passages were also built as a means to escape. The Edfu temple is also so important to Egypt that it is featured on both the 20 and 1 pound Egyptian notes.


Back on the bus we drove the rest of the day to Luxor where once again lunch was missed from the itinerary and we arrived starving! We picked up a new guide to take us out to Luxor temple which took about 400 years to build as each Pharaoh kept adding and building their own sections to the complex. Even Ramesses II (who built himself the massive temples at Abu Simbel) built himself another temple here with lots more statues of himself again! There was a massive mix of different designs, with hundreds of different elaborately carved columns, various statues, obelisks and even a &apos;kill tally&apos; for one king with a cartoush (the oval where the name is written in hieroglyphs) signifying the amount of people he had killed on a massive wall opposite his statue.

We also learnt why egyptians are depicted the way that they are in the paintings as well, left foot forward tin a strong warrior stance and then front on so the stomach doesn&apos;t show! The one open hand and one closed hand on their knees indicated strength and open mindedness. quite cool!

There was a scarab beetle signifying good luck if you walked around this in an anti clockwise direction, but Jarrad and Scotty decided that walking the opposite way and carrying me was funnier. So far so good though–no bad luck to date! We watched sunset over the temple then headed over to Karnak temple, a gorgeous temple lit by lights a few minutes away.

At the front of this temple there is an obelisk on the left and just an empty space on the right–where the obelisk that is now in Plaza de la Concorde in Paris once stood, but was swapped by the egyptians in return for a clock. It is funny as working in Europe you drive past this obelisk every time you are in Paris and now we could actually see where it came from! From here it is awesome to also look at Rams row, which is hundreds of sphinx&apos;s with heads of rams that link Luxor and Karnak temples.

Another fantastic massive egyptian feed of a bargain 4 courses for about 5 english pounds made us so full we could barely roll as we headed to the english pub for a pool competition with some locals.


We were all excited to head off the next morning as we drove out to the famous Valley of the Kings, where all the ancient Pharaohs were buried. There is a website -The ban Mapping Project - http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/ - which is a totally amazing site showing you all the details of the Valley of the Kings and each individual tomb and chambers. The Valley has all the entrances and then the tombs are built into the mountains, some quite short if the king had only ruled for a short time, others really really long in the king had ruled for a long number of years. We started in the tomb of Ramesses IV (20th dynasty), Ramesses III (20th) and then the warrior King Horm Hep (18th dynasty).

The tombs are absolutely amazing. They start at the time the king comes into power by chipping away the rock to firstly create the tunnel into the tomb where they create various chambers and continue on into the middle of the earth. The walls are then even out and covered in plaster. Designs are then drawn onto the wall in red paint, then confirmed in black paint and then the plaster is chipped away around each individual drawing. These are then carefully painted. Crazy! It must have been so time consuming! We could see each stage of this process throughout the various tombs as the kings died they had to be buried within 70 days and so often the tombs were not entirely finished. Some also included booby traps to ward off the grave robbers such as massive pits in the middle of the passageways for them to fall into and die. Some of the passageways were so steep and long as well, it was amazing how they managed to get the massive stone tombs inside with just logs and ropes.

It was ridiculously hot in the valley, surrounded by desert with the sun beating down on you and also inside the tombs, and climbing the long steep stairways i felt sorry for all the retirees trying to navigate them! We saw one lying in the shade with her feet up and our guide told us that often people die in the middle of summer. Definitely would not like to be here then!!

We then decided to head into the boy King, King Tutankhamen&apos;s tomb which was the only tomb to be discovered basically intact in 1922 after 5 years of searching. It then took another 10 years to photograph, document and remove all the artifacts that were inside,such as chariots, jewelery etc, most of which we saw at the Egyptian museum in Cairo. Scientists were still in there also doing work on assessing the techniques used on the walls. The open coffin was still there and the mummified body of Tut also which was amazing to see.

We then headed to the Al Deir Al Bahari Temple which is the temple of Queen Hapsephut carved into the side of a massive rock mountain. Queen H originally married her first King and then remarried several different Kings that came into power as was the tradition at the time and after so many years also made her mark on Egypt. Surrounding the temple are many many holes in the cliffs where no0bles are buried an also where the workers used to take their breaks from building the temple.

And then to the massive Statues of Memnon and I have no idea what they were, or their purpose in life, but they were definitely massive!

Our hotel in Luxor was amazing with a massive pool and swim up bar which we spent the afternoon lazing about enjoying before taking horse and cart rides to luxor market.

 
Made from wood and covered in gold - The story of ancient Egypt! Part 3

2009-11-18 to 2009-11-20


Back on the minibus! Again off through the desert we spent the day driving from Luxor to Hurgada, 4 egyptian hours...which could mean any length of time really! But we managed to arrive in enough time to drive through Hurgada, a city only 35 years old, but already so dirty, run down, poorly planned, and probably the worst we had been in in Egypt!

We tied our arabian scarfs around our heads and jumped onto our quad bikes to start the desert safari. In a line we sped off, promptly being so covered in dust we would not see anything as we drove through the desert into the sun at ridiculously high speeds! As a result we had many close calls but luckily avoided any major accidents... just a few small cases of whiplash as you couldn&apos;t see the people in front slow down! Climbing up a desert hill we had an amazing view of the expansive Egyptian desert before zooming off to a Bedouin camp (Arabian Nomads) to go camel riding and smoke sheisha... except they forgot us and we were stuck in a little mud brick room in the dark until we decided just to head off anyway! It was pitch black by this stage and the bikes were turned on and systematically belted to make the at least one headlight work... but even the biggest belting would not make mine turn on as the guide just shrugged his shoulders and jumped on his bike! Clearly this was not a workable solution and we swapped bikes... so the guide had it instead.... and we tried to follow black into black. As a result we all lost each other and ended up going cross country alone, at speed to try and catch up, not knowing whether we were going to end up in a ditch or what! Ahhh the joys of no OH&amp;S! We stopped again to try and regroup and swapped bikes around again, giving the guide light and me ending up on one without a protective cover over the engine. Oh my gosh talk about hot!!!!!!!!! One of the bikes then broke down and it couldn&apos;t be fixed so we left it in the desert and I rode with the guide, one handle each and tried to keep straight! He took off at speed toward the lights on the horizon to try and overtake all the groups as we flew cross country at about 50km an hour according to the speedo, fish tailing and having a general adventure to arrive back at camp and await the arrival of the group... minus our tour guide Hamada and a quad bike guide....turns out they had lost the group, the guide didnt know where to go and we had left them behind somewhere in the desert! About 15 or so mins later they turned up, a little shaken after their adventure, but luckily no injuries from the guides ridiculous riding up and down mounds causing the bike to launch.... as he had no idea where he was going. good hey!

Hurgada is quite a dangerous city made up of low socio economic communities and we were advised not to go out alone we had included buffet dinners at the hotel. so good! But quite expensive compared to the street for the other things such as drinks and we learnt our lesson trying to bring water / juice into the hotel having them all confiscated by security (as apparently we had to buy them there) so had to find inventive ways to hide them to bring them in!


So making the most of another buffet breakfast feast and it was time to sign out our snorkeling gear and board the boat for a journey out onto the beautiful clear blue Red Sea. We stopped at a massive reef on the way and saw huge moray eels, cornetfish and so many different types of beautiful marine life. The crew came around and made us all hats out of our towels before a traditional lunch and we arrived on Giftun Island, all crammed into a small refugee boat and trying to avoid sinking! We had a plan to make a calender of the trip and so here began the journey of photo taking!

We decided to hit the town tonight in Hurgada so we jumped into a cab to head in. One of the clubs we went to was really weird–they shooed everyone off the dance floor and brought out girls who wern&apos;t particularly good dancers and one dude with a really mad mullet haircut to do some random dances. So weird! I was heading home in a cab with Allira and Hamada our guide had spoken to the cabbie to tell him he had his identity number, no funny business or he would call the police. It all started out well enough, but halfway along he demanded more money and stopped the cab and refused to go any further, risking at best stranding us in the middle of nowhere in the dark. Luckily we both managed to diffuse the situation and in the end Allira got so mad at him, he drove us back no worries and she even forced him to apologise before he left! Hilarious! It was pretty dodgy though and the next day our guide reported him to the police for his actions as they were so dodgy and illegal.

Another lovely day to chill out followed as we again ate our weight in the buffet breakfast, played volleyball on the beach and then walked into town. A bit of internet time and wandering around when i tried to head into Burger King to use the bathroom and was watched by one of the employees, followed to the back of the restaurant, up the stairs and would not leave me alone until i yelled at him, he decided to wipe the basin and then stand outside. Finally he got the message and left. SO weird!

The tour that we had all booked upon actually drove back to Cairo and then over to Dahab, which was about 11 egyptian hours on a bus and overnight stop in awful Cairo... but we managed to convince our tour leader that we didnt want to do this and would just catch the ferry across to Sharm el Sheik and drive up toDahab, saving us about 7 hours travel!

So we were up early to catch the sunrise and then onto the minibus to say farewell to our guide Hamada as we were dropped off at the ferry port with no idea where to go! We figured out the plan and stamped our tickets,went through the box pretending to be a metal detector and onto the boat. As we boarded the crew were giving out tablets to everyone which we declined. Apparently they were sea sickness tablets. And we soon found out why we needed them!!!!! What a ridiculous bumpy ride!!!!!!!!! awful!!!!!!!! I cannot say any more... plain awful! The journey was supposed to be an hour and a half... egyptian hours! As we arrived about 3 and a half hours later! A topdeck bus was supposed to be meeting us but it was nowhere to be found! We walked up the hill and found a minibus with a topdeck sign in the window and hopped on and hoped to be not highjacked and dropped in the desert!

Driving along through the desert in the middle of nowhere with mountains either side of us we randomly came across a little &apos;service stop&apos; with goats and dogs in the toilets and a boat–in the middle of nowhere! bizarre! About 2 hours later we arrived in Dahab, the driver a little confused as he dropped us off at the back instead of the front of our hotel! We were staying in the Happy Life Village Resort which was a massive resort right on the Red Sea with its own beach, 3 pools, 2 waterslides, restaurants, scuba club, games room... you name it!

Each day the cleaners came into the rooms and made the bedspreads and towels into various shapes such as doves, love hearts, flowers... and fold your clothes!!! weird!!!! But not only that, they knew your room number, then hang around outside your room to find out how you liked it!

So a great hotel, but also a little bit out of town and so needed to catch the shuttle in for dinner. We walked through town,down the esplanade into a little restaurant called Yallla. Egypt were playing Algeria that night in a world cup qualifier for the soccer and the whole of the town were excited, flags drawn on their faces and tv&apos;s pulled out into the streets to watch the game. As the last goal was scored and the game won 2-0 by Egypt the entire town went crazy! The music blared, people danced like maniacs, burnt the algerian jersey and there was a massive impromptu street party!

The next day we went into town and got some supplies ready for our big evening! It was nap time and luckily i placed a wake up call with reception.... as it never came! I headed down to the pool to get some food that the same guy at reception had told me was 24 hour to find it stopped at 10pm! oh well! Luckily i had &apos;acquired&apos; some extra breakfast! :+) 11pm we all met in reception ready to climb Mt Sinai.

Mt Sinai is very significant in the Christian culture as it is where Moses received the 10 commandments from Jesus. We jumped on the bus and drove for about 2 hours to the start point of the trek. We paid 2 egyptian pounds(LE) to pee here too! crazy! We then joined hundreds of other trekkers and pilgrims in the dark walking up the first section, attempting to avoid being run over by camels and avoid their wet droppings everywhere! Some people opted to ride camels, but most of us trekked, making a path with our torches up the trail. We stopped at various little &apos;coffee shops&apos; along the way which was quite random! And COLD!!! walking was okay in a t-shirt, but when you stopped the freezingness hit you in a split second. awful!


We continued our ascent which wasn&apos;t actually too bad.... but a definite kickstart to the fitness campaign after doing nothing but lying in bed for the last month!!! Until the last section of 750 stairs anyway. pain!!!!! Finally we arrived at the top, hired a little mattress to stop the cold whilst we waited, and rockclimbed across the face of the mountain, kind of glad we couldnt see down onto a little rock jutting out that we were all to huddle on. We rugged up with everything we owned and watched out waiting for the first suns rays to rise over the horizon.. It was dead quiet as we sat there waiting, literally on top of the world before different layers of coloured rows of light began to shine through the darkness and the glowing pink ball of sun arrived to show us the gorgeous mountainous terrain we had climbed.

We completed a few more pics for our calender and began our descent down the &apos;steps of repentance&apos; that were built by monks thousands of years ago. Down down down down down we walked the uneven rock steps.......3500 apparently!!!! 14km :+)

Meeting up at the bottom we entered Saint Catherines Monastery, where God set the burning bush alight to catch Moses&apos; attention to speak to him and tell him to climb the mountain to receive the commandments. The monks that live here are also the ones that built all the crazy steps up.

Back to the bus and so tired after missing a nights sleep! It was afternoon by the time we arrived back to the hotel and walked down to the beach and jumped off the jetty into the beautiful blue water to swim around and snorkel on the reef with all the marine lifeon our doorstep..

Meeting up for dinner we headed into Same same, but different for dinner with the gang and all tried to stay awake!!!!!!!!!

Struggling out of bed the next morning we limped into town as some guys scuba dived, and the rest of us chilled out at the net cafe, had a delicious lunch at Aladdin, where sitting next to the water we suddenly saw a movement outside and 2 young girls were tapping on the window trying to sell us bracelets!!!

Back to swim out the pain in the beautiful hotel beach and snorkel as we watched the sunset over the mountains around us. so cool!

The next morning dawned another beautiful day as we brought snorkels and hired jeeps to take us to the famous blue cave snorkel spot just outside Dahab. As we drove along,we passed a check point as we see commonly throughout egypt and suddenly the driver said...&apos;safari???&apos; and all of the sudden drove the jeep off the side of the road, up and down the sand as we hung on for dear life in the back, being thrown around and trying not to be thrown out the back with a lack of seat belts or anything real to hold on to!

The blue cave is a really famous dive/snorkel spot, a massive massive blue cavern, much further down than you could see and outwards in all directions full of amazing reef,coral and marine life. I saw gorgeous little Nemo fish in their home, schools of those super fancy lion fish with all their spikes out and hundreds of awesome awesome sights! Unfortunately it was really cold in so hard to stay long, but soooo awesome!

On the way out we ran out of petrol... even though we were only about 15 mins from town and had to wait for the other jeep to return with a water bottle full so we could begin again!! We stopped at a desert oasis which was were fresh water seeps through from the ground and many varieties of plant life grow all around the area, making a cool little escape from the desert. Then our final stop just a few mins south of the hotel to the famous snorkel spot called the 3 pools, which surprisingly enough was 3 pools! :+) We swam though literally thousands and thousands of whitebait in schools so thick you could barely see through them, schools of Dory fish from Nemo, saw massive bright blue clams opening and closing and heaps of the long, thin cornetfish. It was amazing!

Our final night together had arrived :+(! Egypt was again playing a football world cup qualifier against alergia and so we suited up for the occasion with cleopatra eyes and &apos;go egypt&apos; written across our faces in arabic. Unfortunately it was not to be and the town was dead silent as Egypt lost the match and their chance at the world cup. We had a fantastic dinner though at a beautiful restaurant on the water called Ali Baba that had masses of fresh seafood and prawns bigger than your entire hand!

Our final all you eat breakfast buffet before our backpacking trip started! Bags packed and we were on the road again! Our time in Egypt had drawn to a close and we had to say goodbye to our new friends GI and Jo as we caught a mini bus to the border town of Taba to begin our adventures in Jordan and Israel, sitting in the smallest mini van known to man kind where even my knees were squished up against the seat in front! In Egypt you always need police clearance for your route for tourists and we figured it out they saw it is for safety, we say it is just for the police to get lifts as we stopped and picked up several random police on the way, which is apparently quite common as it is even mentioned in the lonely planet!

One place I never though I would end up - Backpacking through Israel and Jordan PART 1

2009-11-19 to 2009-11-21


Disclaimer–this is full of history but i needed it for the context!!!!:+) k x

Our mini bus driver stopped short of the border and dropped us at Taba, Egypt. Here we gathered our backpacks and walked through. We paid our 2LE (Egyptian pound) departure tax and walked some more to place our bags on the &apos;scanners&apos; or tin boxes, fill in the documentation and then try to make sense of trying to get a re-entry visa. About an hour later....even though we were practically the only people there we managed to escape Egypt and walk over to Eilat to attempt to enter Israel!

Entering one by one, some passports were tagged and taken as we put our bags on nice clean new state of the art scanners and the majority of the bags were then tagged as well, taken and fully searched, Wiggy and I walked through unscathed as the rest of the group pulled out every single one of their belongings or got drug swabbed! We were asked many questions, but then..... hooray! Passports stamped and each of us had made it to Israel!!!! And it was gorgeous! You could definitely tell the difference between Egypt and Israel that was for sure!! We had come from a tiny undeveloped town in the middle of the desert to a clean sprawling city with roads, gutters, shops, and you name it!amazing!!!!

Catching taxis to the town centre we attempted to get cash at the ATMs to no avail, but finally managed to change some money to pay the cabbies who were waiting impatiently by the side of the road. And what a crazy cabbie we had!! Telling us he had autopilot just like a plane, he took his hands off the wheel, ate his lunch, drank his drink and overtook on blind corners. Let us just say we were definitely very securely buckled up for that ride! He was really sweet too though, offering us napkins for our lunch and even the good hand moisturizer as we were Australians!

We finally were on our way, walking up to the bus station to find tickets to Tel Aviv.... And got lucky, all 9 of us managed to get onto a 3pm bus which was subsequently booked out around us as we sat on the floor and waited the few hours until it left. Well, overbooked ii should say as people sat in the aisle and in the doorway for the trip! 5 hours later we arrived in Tel Aviv, jumped on the local bus and headed to our hostel. What a massive day of traveling, arriving in about 10pm at night. The hostel was located just a few minutes from the beach so we headed down to check it out before planning our attack on the country!

The non arab Israeli&apos;s stop work at half past 2 on a Friday and don&apos;t begin work again until about 6pm on the Saturday for the Sabbath. And this is everything - public transport included so we had to quickly work out our time frame, routes and where we wanted to be around it all! And so hire car it was!!

The next morning we got a good deal on a van that could take all 9 people with backpacks and checked out the camel markets, full of cool little souvenirs, knick nacks, bakery items, clothes, fruit and veg and everything! Then watching the sunset over the Red Sea with all the kite surfers and locals playing racquetball on the beach we definitely felt lucky to be able to be there!

Everywhere you went you saw the Israeli people out and about enjoying the outdoors and walking, running, riding bikes or playing games, it was great! Past all these awesome little exercise sites with heaps of weights and cardio equipment that just use body weight to work them and a massive massive playground we continued along the beach promenade to the old city of Jaffa. We made wishes on the &apos;wishing bridge&apos; which required you to touch your zodiac sign, look out towards the city and wish, and walked around the various ruins, old city streets and architectural remains.

National service is also still compulsory in Israel and there are armed uniformed personnel everywhere you look!

We cooked an Asian stirfry... Vegetables!! woohoo!!!:+) in the hostel that night and the next morning it was time for................... Road Trip Israel! Loading up the van we hit the road and navigated out of the city towards Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. Trying to drive through the city map less we found some parking and walked to the Church of Annunciation where Mary was told she was to bear the son of God. It has a 60&apos;s facade which was nice, but nothing compared to the inside! As soon as you entered you could definitely feel something as the high ceiling and beautiful designed church surrounded you. The choir sung beautiful hymns constantly as we saw the Australian painting inside (there is one from most countries in the world somewhere in the grounds) and went downstairs to see the lower floor built into the rock. The bottom entrance was also beautiful with elaborate carved doors and designs. The Church of Saint Josephs was also on the grounds which is said to be the location of the Joseph&apos;s House.

We stopped at a little roadside servo on the way and brought kebabs....Israeli style–pita, a few bits of bbq chicken annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd 90% tahini!!! (it is the sesame paste dip....the base of what you make hummus out of) I am talking about 2 m thick and with tiny chunks of cauliflower. yup! And yes, totally impossible to eat.

Next stop, the churches at the Sea of Galilee! The first stop was the Mount of Beatitudes, a church on top of a hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee where Jesus gave his blessings or beatitudes which start of each sermon.

Down to the Primacy of St Peters where Jesus reappeared to the apostles after he was crucified. This was also located on the edge of the Sea of Galilee where Jesus is said to have walked on water. Next door was the Multiplication of the fish and loaves church which is on the spot where Jesus multiplied fish and bread to feed the masses but unfortunately this was closed.

It was dark by this stage and we began navigating out...deciding the best route was the highway alongside the border between Israel and Jordan, we saw the lights of Jordan across the Jordan Sea and... all of the sudden a Palestinian checkpoint was upon us... welcome to the West Bank :+). Occasionally there were these odd massive bulk stores by the side of the road selling water, soft drinks, snacks etc or garden ornaments, blow up pool toys or anything! so this became our latest comfort stop, and allowed us to set foot on Palestinian ground for the first time.

We successfully navigated through to Jerusalem, through the walls of the old city and out the other side to our hostel! We were staying at the New Palm Hotel and had a room for the 9 of us, 4 double bunk beds squished in, a mattress on the floor in the middle taking up the remainder of available floor space and one toilet/shower combination for all of us–with no communal toilets or showers anywhere! weird deign!!!! With no opening window in the room or bathroom, no exhaust fan, and no cleaner, let me tell you that room was less than nice within a few days!!!

Ready to explore Jerusalem the next morning, Jarrad and I walked around the markets of the new town and through the old town to the Jaffa Gate entrance where we we met our guide for the free city walking tour and heard about the city being conquered 38 times!!!! Beginning at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre we walked through to the roof to see where the Ethiopians had built themselves their little city on top! This was the site of the crucification of Jesus, where he was initially laid and then also where he was placed into his tomb which we were to return later and see.

The city is split into quarters–the Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Armenian quarters, all with 2-4 thousand people, except the muslin which has 27000 people squished in there!! It is an amazing city in that there are all kinds of religions living side by side without any problems at all.

Walking to the Muslim quarter we saw old Mameluke architecture who were slave soldiers to the Arab ruler. The Mamelukes were also such good soldiers they were the only ones who could defeat the Mongels. The Arab ruler at the time pretended to congratulate them and put on a parade for them, which lured them into the one place to be slaughtered under canon fire so they could no longer pose a problem to him.

It was interesting to see that as the city had been conquered so many times, each new conquerer would just use whatever they found to their advantage and so old roman coffins were stripped and are still in place today as donkey troughs!

The famous Jewish Western Wailing wall is split into a male and female area just as the Jewish synagogues are. Here thousands and thousands of people come to write their prayers and leave them in the wall. Moving with the times,you can now also mail or email these in if you are unable to make it in person!

It is said that the reason the wailing wall is called so is because the Jews are wailing that their most holy site is within sight but they cannot get to it. This is the stone of life directly above the wailing wall, but located in the Muslim sector under the Dome of the Rock mosque. In Judaism this is said to be the rock that God started life upon. It is fascinating to sit here and watch the orthodox Jews in their 19th century getup with side curls, top hats and cloaks alongside everyone else dressed in their modern day attire!

There are also several access points onto the roof overlooking the entire city and we were treated to a bird&apos;s eye view of the golden Dome of the Rock and the crowded city streets.

The ancient roman city roads that run north/south and east/west are still also there under the current city as each new conquerer just built on top more and more to make the city what they wanted!


As we finished, our guide Kobi told us about the mark of Jerusalem that God had as is mentioned in the bible, and as we are all made in his image, we all have this also. He showed us his hand where all the lines had either merged or vanished, leaving him with a map of the city of Jerusalem on his right hand. And yup, definitely saw it! Bizarre! ut nope, do not have it! apparently if you stay in Jerusalem long enough you will get it!!


And time for more walking as the Mount of olives tour began! This is where Jesus spent his last weeks teaching and praying. For Jews and Muslims, the Mount of Olives is also where the gates of heaven will open upon Judgment day at the end of the world.

We looked over the valley of judgment and hell which is between the old and new cities and is where the Israelis believe that judgment will take place on judgment day. It is quite a nice park and in the summer people bbq there... therefore Jokes commonly used - roasting in hell or if in winter- hell has frozen over!


The first stop on the mount was the tiny Ascencion church.... the smallest place we visited and the only place we actually had to pay 5 scheckls to enter!!!! It is said that this is where Jesus ascended to heaven. There is a footprint said to be the footprint of Jesus as he ascended. This church now also has a mosque-like dome on the roof, &apos;re-decorating&apos; from one of the conquests.

At the back of the mount we had a view from a hotel over the desert, 2/3 of Israel and part of Jordan. This is where Jesus stayed for 40 days and 40 nights wandering the desert and also where in the bible it says the goat took all the sins of the people and it was led into the desert wilderness as the first scapegoat!!

At the Jewish cemetery we watched the beautiful sunset over the city and saw all the rocks placed on the graves instead of flowers in the jewish tradition. Here also rest an 87 year old/ 9 year old who were the youngest and oldest to die in the Israeli war of Independence, which began the day after the country declared independence!

The postcard shot of the church cross lining up the cross with the dome on the rock led us to the cemetery of the prophets where apparently the prophets rest. This is on the property of a Muslim family who open this every day for the pilgrims.... but don&apos;t worry, they charge everyone to enter!

Nearby there is a large garden–the garden of gethsemane- full of olive trees which are up to 500 years old, and only the pope is allowed to eat them!

Next door is the Church of Mary Magdalene, or the Church of Agony where Jesus prayed the night before his crucification and was comforted by the angles as he wept about the pressure that was placed upon him with his crucification; showing that he was human. This church was beautiful with lots of mosaics, and a large stone in the middle of the church which is said to be the site of Jesus praying in front of the alter, and you could definitely feel something eiree in here as well that gave you goosebumps! as we were leaving a little mass was starting and several long rows of people walked in singing hymns and heading towards the rock, it was really cool.

The Virgin Mary church was the final stop as we also saw an ancient crusader queen&apos;s grave on the way down to the entrance. It is well below today&apos;s street level by about 47 steps and always always used to flood for centuries and centuries until the British made a drainage system after they conquered.

Cold and dark,we walked down the hill through the Lion&apos;s Gates where we saw the decorated doors of a person who had made the pilgrimage to Mecca, a centuries old tradition still practiced today, and then headed back into the Church of the Sepulchre to see the spot where Jesus was crucified, lain out and then placed in the tomb. There are still the original rocks of all of these sites here too.

We walked back along Via delorosa which is the route that Jesus carried the cross and is marked out as stations of the cross with large numbers the site of every occurrence along route, ie. where Jesus first fell, where Mary joined him etc for pilgrims who carry crosses and follow this route through the city.

It was beginning to get really cold so we bundled up and although we had already done over 7 hours on walking tours, then walked along Jaffa st, the main st in the new city up to Ben Yehuda which was a large pedestrian mall full of lively shops and cafes! We stuffed ourselves on a massive thai meal which was a very nice welcome change from falafel kebabs... which as tasty as they are–one can only eat so much, pita, hummus and falafel!!!!!!

 
One place I never though I would end up - Backpacking through Israel and Jordan PART 2

2009-11-22 to 2009-11-28


Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand Day tour day! Back in the van I again was navigating and Jarrad driving as we headed out of Jerusalem and onto the highway towards Jericho - the oldest city in the world and also near where Jesus wandered through the desert for 40 days and then was tempted by the devil.

As we came close we were stopped at a Palestinian checkpoint as the city is a Palestinian controlled territory. Smiling uncertainly in our Israeli plated car, we were questioned and then let through as we drove along almost deserted streets, looking at the USAID signs that had been shot out, all the Palestinian flags and general feeling of eireeness. We saw a truck load of kids all dressed up,yelling and waving Palestinian flags as we passed, it sounds awful, but it just looked like they were the next generation of fighters, beginning to learn the trade young.

We drove up the mountain and parked to walk up the final part to the temptation monastery where we climbed the hundreds of stairs, knocked on the monastery door, were taken to the little church and then the cave where the devil is said to have tempted Jesus in a test after fasting in the desert for 40 days and nights. And what an amazing view over the mountains and city of Jericho!!!

Here we began to hear gunfire off in the distance, reminding us further how much turmoil still exists around the middle east. Quickly back into the car, a drive through stop at the Palace of Issain and the &apos;oldest city in the world sign&apos; and it was through the checkpoint and out of there before anything could happen to us! Back on the highway towards.... the dead sea!!

First stop at Qumran, where in 1947 a nomadic Bedouin shepherd found 7 ancient scrolls in a cave. So christened the dead sea scrolls, these are 2000 year old testament books and other works now held in a museum. We continued on to Ein Gedi where we headed down past the umbrellas, down the steep slope and hit the rocky water edge of the dead sea!!!! There were waves which we did not expect and quite a current in this swimming location, but apparently further down the dead sea it is a little calmer....next time :+). Jarrad ran in first and dived in, coming up screaming! It is so salty and dense his eyes were in that much pain. Luckily, after this the the rest of us walked in instead! And it was amazing! You stood upright floating in the water and you were already almost waist out, and no matter what you did you could no sink!!!! We sat, we lay, we basked and it was unbelievable! Definitely one of my highlights - I could have stayed there all day!!!

Attempting to wash the slimy slimy salt off our bodies we headed off and found the signs for the lowest point on earth! pretty cool! A few photos later we drove through the beautiful desert with high mountains and nothing to be seen besides Israeli checkpoints to Massada–a fortress high in the mountains where the Jewish hid out and then killed themselves rather than surrender to the Romans. A ballot was drawn and 9 soldiers were selected to kill everyone and the last one was to commit suicide, the only one to die in such a way as suicide was classed as wrong.


Beginning to lose daylight, we hit the road straight to Bethlehem. We saw the wall separating the Palestinian controlled city of Bethlehem from Israel and then the massive checkpoint we had to enter through. We had been warned that we might not have been let through, but luckily after a quick chat and passport inspection we were waved through.

Bethlehem was busy!!! It was much more graffitied than what we had seen in Israel/the Palestinian territories so far, and crammed full of shops, houses, and people! We drove up to the main square–Manger square- and to the Church of the Navitivity which is the oldest church in the world and also home to the manger where Jesus was born. It was a large church and we joined the queue to head downstairs to see the rock where Jesus was born, and the area where Mary and Joseph and Jesus rested. There was a tour group in there as we entered singing away in a manger which was really awesome. It was soooooooooooo warm own there too!

 

We saw the Church of the Milk Grotto, a place traditionally described as the site where the Virgin Mary stopped to breast feed the Baby Jesus during the flight to Egypt. A legend recalls how Mary spilt some milk while breast feeding baby Jesus thus turning the stone of this cave a&quot;white stone&quot;color. The church was built on this site and contains the&quot;white stone rock&quot;.Church of the Milk Grotto, a place traditionally described as the site where the Virgin Mary stopped to breast feed the Baby Jesus during the flight to Egypt. A legend recalls how Mary spilt some milk while breast feeding baby Jesus thus turning the stone of this cave a&quot;white stone&quot;color. The church was built on this site and contains the&quot;white stone rock&quot;.

 

Then completed what we like to call a &apos;driving tour of Bethlehem&apos; in the dark trying to locate the right checkpoint to get out before queueing up for hours waiting to get through!

The hire car apparently had no insurance in any of the Palestinian controlled cities such as Jericho and Bethlehem and we had been warned not to drive there...but, seeing a there was really no other way to get there except pay for a ridiculously expensive tour that did not fit our time frame we headed in anyway! And luckily...no accidents! Phew!!!!:+)


Another thing I found really interesting is that no Israelis are allowed into Palestinian territories or visa versa which is really sad. It is the same for Egyptians into Israel, so the Egyptians all their lives share a border with a country that they are never to be allowed to see.


That evening I went for a walk into the new town to go to a store and was followed the entire way by a guy about my age that refused to leave me alone, just tell me how beautiful i was and all sorts of stupid things about the reason I came to Jerusalem was to meet him! He even waited outside a store i went into to get rid of him, sped up, ducked in and out of streets and places I was weaving and everything. unbelievable hey! the nerve of some people!!! Luckily I was in the main city and I was confident I could take him on :+) but it was disappointing as it was the only time in the entire Middle East that I was really hassled...well,except for being grabbed to look at stupid pashmina&apos;s in markets of course!! And then someone tried a similar line on me on the way back as well! I don&apos;t think he knew what hit him :+)


Apparently the country has been in drought for 7 years and as we drove out of Jerusalem towards the border of Eliat the rain began! We like to think we broke the drought :+) It was only a couple of hundred kms to cover for the day, but driving through the desert it was about 5 hours before we arrived to drop the hire car off in Elat. The desert was gorgeous though, with rock formations, mountains, and different sand patterns everywhere. Along the way whilst on the highway we drove through an Israeli live firing range, saw tanks, helicopters and all kinds of exciting things!

Dropping the hire van and taxiing to the border town of Akava we had a nice straight forward crossing walking through to Jordan and......made it! The bus information we had was everywhere and it turned out in the end there ware none after all so we haggle a price of a taxi for the 2 hour drive to Petra. The country looked more like Egypt than Israel with less formed roads and less infrastructure, but the Jordanians were definitely were friendly! Our cabbie gave us a guided tour on the drive and we learnt so much about all of Jordan! The mountains were gorgeous too, as was the sunset over them as we traveled. ahhh +)

We were staying in Wadi Musa (meaning Moses&apos; Valley in Arabic) in a tiny little town a few minutes outside of Petra, and the people were lovely! Unfortunately the rooms, bedding and bathroom let a lot to be desired as the toilet and sink were almost hanging off the wall, the shower was placed almost over the toilet...and with no hot water!!!! brrrr!! It was even cold enough just to buy fridge items from the supermarket and hang them outside the window until you needed them!

I got up early the next morning to watch the sunrise an brrrr was it cold!! But it was Petra day so amazingly exciting! Petra is an ancient city carved into the sandstone rocks by the Nabataeans, an ancient Arab tribe, and is now classified as one of the 7 wonders of the world. http://www.visitjordan.com/Default.aspx?Tabid=63 It was once a massive thriving city, but was gradually abandoned and after the 14th Century was completely lost until rediscovered in 1812. Even more interesting is that even though there is so much there, only 40% of Petra has been uncovered, there is still masses and masses to go!

We walked past caves in which the nomadic Arabian Bedouin people still used up until 25 years ago, a triclinium used for sacred feasts, and arrived at As-Siq, the main entrance to Petra–a 1.2km natural gorge with cliffs up to 80m either side with water channels and pipes, features and all sorts of things carved into the rocks 2000 years ago. A perfectly defended city with the one narrow entrance through the massive rocks that towered either side of us.

As we continued down the narrow passage we were all asked to look one direction and then turn around as we were greeted with our first view of the famous treasury between the gorge walls. It is 45m high and 30m wide carved into the rock, used as a tomb, a temple and called the treasury as people believed that jewels were held in the large pot adorning the top.... but after breaking it and finding it empty, the name had already stuck!

Next was the street of facades with rows of carved tombs and an amphitheatre carved into solid rock capable of holding 7000 people! Royal tombs, and various other tombs followed before we arrived at the colonnaded street which led through the city centre and was once flanked by temples, shops, buildings etc. The original marble pavement is still there today and the Qasr al-int temple which is the only thing on the street that has survived the numerous earthquakes as it was built with a piece of wood through it to absorb the impact! Pretty smart!!!!!

We said goodbye to our guide and began to climb the 800 stairs cut into the rock to the top of Ad-deir mountain to find the monastery. We had no idea what to expect as as we arrived tired and hot at the top, narrowly avoiding all the donkeys coming up the same path and the children as young as about 2 trying to see us jewelery!!! We saw a small structure and headed towards it, only to turn to our right and see a massive temple built into the rock just like the scale of the treasury!!!! It was gorgeous and seeing someone on the very very top, Jarred and i headed up the side, scaling the smooth, slippery rock until we reached a set of stairs that wound around to the very top of the structure. Standing there on top watching all the people below like ants was amazing! We sat on the edge,f eet hanging off to take it all in before someone noticed we were there and yelled at us to comedown! Apparently it is soft, unsafe and we will either damage ourselves or the monument! Oh well, it was definitely amazing to have climbed up onto the top of a 2000 year old structure that is one of the 7 wonders of the world though!!!!

It was time to head to the last stop of the day - to walk the 550 steps to the high place of sacrifice built right on top of the rocks overlooking Petra below and the gorgeous natural surroundings. We saw the sun begin to set over the top of the mountains and began our several km trek out of Petra before the light failed. What a truly amazing place!!! Yup, another highlight there!!

We had our last dinner together at a choice of one of the 2 eateries in town–the local pita bread, hummus and falafel... again!!!!!!! or pizza :+) And all done by one guy as the waiter, barman and chef!!! not bad hey!

We spent our last night chilling out and drawing henna tattoo&apos;s on each other to use up the supplies some of the guys had brought in Egypt; and early Thu morning Jarrad, Michelle, Al, Sammi and I caught cabs back to Akabar border and began our day of crossing three countries! We walked through the Jordanian border to Israel, caught another cab and joined the thousands heading through the Israeli border to Egypt. As there was a Muslim holiday the next day the border was closing ( i didn&apos;t know you could just do that?!!!:+) ) and so everyone was coming through today....luckily we had established this and didn&apos;t get caught out trying to cross the next day!!!! And so we lined up, were pushed,w ere shoved, boiled to death in the crush and then finally, finally about 2 hours later made it out of the queue and to freedom!!! Even more luckily we had befriended a tourist helper whilst we were waiting who organised a bus for us to take us onwards!!!

Back into the desert of Egypt we drove across the deserted land, stopping at dirty little toilets without flushes, paper or soap that we had to pay 1 pound to use!! And then across the Suez Canal, the famous narrow body of water that links the Red and Mediterranean Seas, which was begun in about 200BC and was finally finished in the 1800&apos;s after various different rulers came through and several wars were fought. It is still a massively busy trade route and separates the continent of Asia from Africa.

Finally about 8 hours of driving and well over 14 hours since we started traveling this morn, we arrived in Alexandria, the city founded by Alexander the Great! And a little more rattled than when we had left- the roads were definitely not formed at all and ridiculously bumpy!!!

The city came alive at night with hundreds of stalls,shops, food and people everywhere! The next morning we walked down the water front enjoying the pretty city and laughing at the dozens of kids that were following us pied piper style. Until we noticed that they all ages were carrying various to weapons, some of which shot some of our group with pellets. Some of the older guys made comments to the girls and Al told one off, who then proceeded to follow us pretty much all day!!!

As it was the celebration to mark the end of Ramadan, or the Muslim fasting month there were people everywhere. And as we walked, we noticed the streets were red...with blood. Animals were tied up or put in makeshift pens in the street and then slaughtered, bled, skinned, chopped and sold right where they were. Around every corner was a new slaughtering site and we had to jump over pools of blood, hoofs and entrails. We even saw a cow&apos;s guts being pushed and yellow liquid squirting out. SO gross!!!!!!

The city which we had found so enticing the night before was definitely not one we wanted to return to in a hurry!

We walked to the castle, the bibliotech and mosque and were more than ready to call it quits and head to the bus station... or more accurately the dirty parking lot where the buses stopped! We found a bus and jumped aboard, waiting the hour until departure and settled down to try and breathe through the disgusting cigarette smoke that is still allowed on buses. A few minutes later we were jerked awake with a massive angle on the bus and us staring down at cement and water!!! Apparently part of the road had given way and the driver hadn&apos;t seen it through the water!!! A few nervous minutes later we were able to get on track and continue our journey. whoa!!!!!!

We were dropped off in Cairo in an unknown location in the side lane on the road! random! luckily it turned out to be close to our hotel and we ran excitedly toward a real bed!! and buffet breakfast!! But again no hot water!! arrghh!! Checking out the han hadidi markets the next morning we were amazed at the massive selection of things available and no over the top hassling. So enjoyable! Jumping into the cab on the way home we hit the unmistakable Cairo traffic–what had been about a 10min drive there turned into a 45 min on the way back, but luckily it left enough time to grab our bags, grab the shuttle and head to the airport for our flight back to civilisation! Goodbye sunshine, Hello London winter!!


Oh yes, and apparently I need to give credit to my self titled Executive Assistant for sitting across from me on long bus journeys through the middle east and helping me remember what on earth we learnt on our adventures. Thanks Jarrad!

I&apos;m dreaming of a white Christmas.... Verditz, Austria

2009-12-01 to 2009-12-05


Ridicuously glad to escape the freezing cold grey dreary rain of the UK I bid farewell to the Orange Tree once again and dragged my backpack and suitcase full of thermals, ski gear and every kind of cold weather gear you can possibly think of and elbowed my way onto the London Tube. A seamless transfer to the easybus and I arrived at Stansted airport to check my bag weight. I was flying with a low cost cattle carrier called ryanair and you get charged 20 pound a kilo that your bag is over the 15kg weight limit. Unfortunately I had about 3.5kilos to lose and so placed on all 5 of my jumpers and scarf and walked confidently to the check in. But no, still one kilo over and had to wear my sleeping bag as well!!!!! You are only allowed one regular size carry on so I tried to make it look normal as I met Dani, a girl I worked with in Topdeck who was also heading to to Austria to work and we minced off to board.. and success! i made it on!!!!

As we flew the air hostesses came around offering smokeless cigarettes for purchase!!! ridiculous!!!!

We arrived in Klagenfurt airport and were met by Michelle, the mother and the 2 little 7 year old twin girls I was to nanny for the winter - India and Madeline who were super excited to see us.

We soon arrived at our hotel for the next few months - the Blue Mountain Hotel - www.bluemountainhotel.at 6 km up a mountain called Verditz in the Austrian Alps in the province of Carinthia. The hotel is right on the ski piste so we can just ski in and ski out!! Beautiful!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand my own room! With my own bed, doona and bathroom!! Amazing!!! I can definitely get used to this!! :+)

I spent the next few days playing games with the girls and helping Dani and Michelle get the kitchen and hotel ready for the guests to start arriving for the winter season on the 14th Dec. We headed into the local shpping centre and also to the Villach Christmas Market which was gorgeous. The whole town is decorated and there are stalls full of everything!

Tug, Michelle&apos;s husband arrived home from the UK (the one that had &apos;interviewed&apos; me for a job at Bierfest!) and Dani and I rugged up to meet the truck that was to bring all the new goods we would need for the season. As we stood on the highway waiting for a friend with a trailer the snow started!!!! And it was so beautiful!!! And then it was so freaking cold as we unloaded a new oven, fridge, and all sorts of other supplies!!!!!!!!!!!! BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

And it happened to be my birthday which meant the snow was ordered especially for me! :+) The girls and Dani barracaded me from the kitchen in the afternoon as they made me a banana cake for my birthday. They then turned off all the lights, put a cnadle in it and came out holding it singiing happy birthday together. So cute! We then had a massive mexican feast Dani cooked up with both prawn and ostrich and beef burritos! interesting, but delicious!!!!

 

 

 
-17 and freezing. Life in the Austrian Alps, Verditz, Austria

2009-12-06 to 2009-12-21


So I have settled in to life in the Austrian Alps! :+) The girls, their parents Tug and Michelle, the cook Dani and barman Sean are all really great people, it is relaxed, beautiful and a really nice place to live. The snow has been on and off but we have about 20cm down now, and the snow machines have been working on the piste (ski run). The chairlift opens this week and I get my ski&apos;s - i have to ski as the girls ski! It is many, many, many years since I have skied as I boarded the last few times I have been at the snow so fingers crossed it is like riding a bike and once you learn you never forget!!!

My mornings have consisted of helping Tug clean the rooms ready for the guests. I sometimes sit in the freezing cold ironing room and try to make it into a sauna with the steam roller iron on full blast and iron the bedsheets 4 times per one... so it takes all day to iron a small stack as the rest of the piles just never get any smaller! Or steam cleaning carpet, lifting up the beds and mattresses to vacuum beneath them, sweating attempting to stretch fitted bed sheets over thick mattresses on bunk beds or running up and down the 4 flights of stairs until i can no longer move to flick the switch each time the hoover trips the switch! phew!!!!

 

One of the worst experiences I have had in a long time happened as I walked into my first recently vacated room to clean it out and was promptly knocked back 6 feet by the stench. The guests had only been in there one night, but oh my gosh!!! The room was a pigsty- towels, bedding, rubbish, food, clothes, dirty snotty and bloody tissues everywhere and the bins crammed full of pooey baby diapers. They must have been cooking on some kind of gas stove as that is the only possible explanation for the curry type smell that had permeated all the fittings. And a food fight! How else could there have been food spread from one corner to the next. Disgusting!!!!!!!!!! I opened the window, put on the exhaust fan, plastic gloves and filled a giant giant rubbish bag with their crap, exiting several times so i wouldn&apos;t have to vomit. And then shut the door and left it for Tug, vowing never, ever to re-enter!! The next day, deodorizers and air fresheners later it still stunk! And Tug said it is the worst he had ever seen. Still, it definitely made me think twice about ever deciding to buy my own hotel up in the mountains. All the money in the world isn&apos;t enough to do that every day!!!!!!!!!!

But luckily that was just one day! The rest of my days have consisted of a little spring cleaning, or going into town to help with the shopping, doing activities with the girls, attempting to get them to clean their room...and homework! The girls leave home just after 7am each weekday to get down the mountain to catch the bus to school and then finish at lunch time. After that they have about an hours homework each... and they are 7! I hope that I am not going to be single handedly responsible for them failing the first grade as I never have any idea what their homework says, or what on earth they are supposed to be doing as I read out german grammar, german words and try to make sense of it all. We commonly use the &apos;if it rhymes it must be right&apos; system! Only time will tell!!! :+) But not just homework... Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer in...German, and lines for their parts in the sunday school play (or god club as it translates to english :+) ) .... yup, no idea what on earth it means, if it is pronounced right or anything but both I and they can reel them of the tops of our heads!!!!!!!!!

We have had fun making paper chains like my bro Barrett and sis Bernessa and I used to do to decorate the house when we were little... only in my ingeniousness decided to make then 3 weeks out and so spent the next 3 weeks constantly taping them all back up!!!!

The girls India and Madeleine are very cute and fun, but also very energetic and time demanding so it is very tiring days! They don&apos;t use manners as i believe they have always been able to use the cuteness factor so I have spent the last 3 weeks refusing to do anything unless they use them...it has been a slow road but i think we are finally getting there... not that they enjoyed it one bit!! It is also their responsibility to sharpen their own pencils for school but are always getting in trouble both at home and school as they never do it. I sat at the table with India one day for over half an hour after we had already spent over an hour doing homework whilst she tried every single trick in the book and refused to sharpen her 2 pencils. Needless to say I won in the end. Quite funny. I say I am teaching them valuable life lessons!

One day I also decided that it would be exciting for us to do some painting. Michelle had warned me that it is messy and stressful, so she never does it and none of the other nanny&apos;s ever have, but I was up for some fun. Bearing it in mind it is freezing and snowy outside, the rest of the house is a hotel and so the only place we have to play is their bedroom. And whoa!!!! Yes, it was definitely fun, but we also had to spend the next hour after we finished scrubbing paint from every surface known to mankind (even though i&apos;m sure that the girls just created more mess!!!) and mine and their clothes are still paint stained even though there were smocks! Lesson learnt. :+) They asked if they could do it again. I just laughed!!!

We have played a lot of fun games, and i think maybe i am even getting India to cheat less...maybe!!! Baked and iced Christmas biscuits, made muffins, a gingerbread house, Christmas decorations, puppet theatres, done gymnastics, dances and fashion shows, lots of art and craft, Christmas cards (...although that was like pulling teeth!! turns out it seems like homework!) and started them out stamp collecting... hopefully it will replace that fixation they have collecting old toothbrushes!!!! :+)

We have sung some chritmas carols and they are so cute - &apos;peas on earth for 30 miles......&apos; Ahhhh so that is how &apos;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&apos; is supposed to go!!! :+)


And it is definitely getting cold here now -17 it was yesterday morning!! Brrrr!!!! The heating is set on some kind of weird random timer and so often goes off at odd times during the day and so my day wear usually consists of a full set of thermals under my clothes, several tops and a beanie!!!! brrr!

A pretty interesting tradition here in Austria as well is that as well as the Saint–Nicholas, they also have a devil that travels with him–the Krampus. He comes on the night of the 5th of December and it is hilarious - While Saint Nicholas gives gifts to good children, the Krampus warns and punishes bad children. Traditionally, young men dress up as the Krampus and roam the streets frightening children and women with rusty chains and bells. Images of Krampus usually show him with a basket on his back used to carry away bad children and dump them into the pits of Hell. His costume consists of wooden masks, sheep&apos;s skin, and horns. Scary!!!! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus  

Oh and I almost forgot!!!! The schwartzerman!!!!!!!!! Remember the game we used to play at school, &apos;who&apos;s afraid of the big bad wolf&apos;? well, here in Austria it is &apos;who&apos;s afraid of the schwazerman&apos;..... which translates as the black man!!!!!!!!!! The girls talk about photos of him as a giant black man with a ring through his nose. Can you believe that they can still get away from that in this day and age?!!!hilarious!!!!

I get one day off a week, and as we live 6km up a mountain it is not like we can go anywhere!! I spent my first day off just relaxing, but last week decided to go with the girls to school at the crack of dawn and a neighbour from the mountain, James, drove me into Villach town. I then spent the next 40mins freezing my arse off waiting for the train to head to our nearest big city, Klagenfurt about 40 mins away. It was snowing very heavily as I arrived so spent some significant time sitting in free heating in McDonalds trying to unfreeze my nose! I was wearing every layer of clothing known to existence so was pleasantly surprised to find that I could still move my legs and bend my knees with it all layered on underneath. I am sure I definitely looked like the Michelin man though! I wandered through the city, through the old town and into the new town square where the Christmas markets were held and had a delicious traditional hot fruity drink at the stands. They are the best markets in the region and were nice but i thought they might have been bigger!

It is easy to find your way around as the main street that goes from town to the train station is pretty much called &apos;train street&apos; clearly that is my dodgy translation, it does not translate directly! But so handy! I brought the same ticket that I had on the way in and jumped on the train. As the ticket inspector came around this time he stopped and tried to explain to me that I had the wrong ticket....apparently you can&apos;t buy tickets from the ticket machines fin the train station for the train–they only work on local buses??!! what the??!! I thought 1 euro 80 cents was a ridiculous bargain! :+) But luckily it was too late and he let me travel without paying...not much we could do as we were already on the way though! But it was funny as the ticket man on the way in didn&apos;t say anything! Maybe he just had a laugh at the stupid foreigner and decided not to say anything!

Well that is about it for now - the guests have begun arriving and from here it is go go go, until mid Jan when it calms down a bit and then ramps up again! We are totally full–about 60 people–over New Year so that should be a lot of fun.

 
The world&apos;s iciest and steepest slopes with the kamakazi kids, Verditz, Austria

2009-12-21 to 2010-01-08


And so the guests began to arrive. Actually it was really weird when some of them arrived and I went over to say hello when one said oh!! Karinya! Karinya Kosh! I was a little weird-ed out as I had never met this person in my life... turns out when they were google-ing where they were coming for their holiday my blog had popped up and they had been reading all about me! Let’s just say I have now changed the settings to exclude search engines to stop any more potential stalkers!!!!!


The bar became busy at night and we had a whole lot of fun sitting by the open fire and having theme nights including Caribbean cocktails, Grease, Wii, and my two favourites - Bar Olympics and the‘I’m a celebrity get me outta here’bush tucker nite.


Firstly in the Bar Olympics, all the names were put into a hat and drawn out to allocate teams. The first game was Nails, where nails are placed on top of a massive old tree trunk and starting with the hammer at your knee, you have to raise it and hit your nail in with the small pointy side of the hammer in one swift movement. Yes–challenging!!! Next was the Gerkin race–the fastest to eat a massive disgusting gerkin! And then giant Jenga, just like the regular small version, but GIANT!!! We got to about 29 levels in think before it collapsed–which was a couple less than we achieved when we played with the twins!! Next was fastest to drink from the world’s longest straws that took about 4 massive sucks to get the liquid up and if you stopped drinking to breathe it all fell back down again! Bouncing a coin into a cup, the Limbo...which I somehow won!!, the old favourite beer boat race and then finally - Cheeto Head. This involves one team member’s head being covered in shaving foam and the remainder sanding a few members away and throwing Cheeto’s ( basically twisted French fry shaped chips!) one at a time onto their head. When time is up, they are counted and the team with the most wins. Hilarious!! I was team 2 and somehow we managed to win the Olympics which was heaps of fun and also received some particularly trendy freebie hats from the local brewery! Lovely!


The next most amusing was the‘I’m a celebrity get me outta here’bush tucker nite. Based on the TV show where the celebrities are forced to eat disgusting‘bush tucker’we again made teams and rotated through disgusting cold tinned mussels, baby food, decomposing fish, stomach lining which was THE most disgusting I thought–It was basically several layers of fat a good inch thick, covered with a (apparently) chewy and hard rind. GROSS!!! Something that was apparently goat’s balls, PIG SNOUT! Yup, PIG SNOUT! And several more that I cannot remember! Gross!!!! But highly amusing!


And Pub quiz night! Did you know that during the war the cheese ration per person, per week was 30g.... In case anyone can’t sleep at night.


And then it was Christmas!!! And my first ever winter and white Christmas! We awoke and the girls showed me all their pressies that they had opened at the crack of dawn! Lots of cool stuff, but my personal favourites–a gym mat that was soft and squishy which meant I no longer had to sit on their cold hard floor!! And an art and craft mat which meant I no longer had to spend my days cleaning glue or paint or whatever off the floor!!! And unfortunately LOTS of lollies and the like and so began their massive sugar highs and lows that ensured for the following few days! They also received a tv- but it is not plugged into an antennae, but can show DVD’s... you will hear me talk about this more later!


Unfortunately we had not had much snow at the mountain, the piste was not groomed and the chairlift not operating so most of the guests hung around and chilled out which was nice. We had an early dinner with everyone and our neighbours on the mountain–an English couple James and Allison and their Children Jak and Izzy. We had pumpkin soup, a massive roast with all the trimmings, followed by Christmas pudding and custard! Yum! For some reason a lot of people don’t seem to like Christmas pudding... But it worked out well for me as I could eat my weight in it!After dinner everyone chilled out at the bar and we had a disco which the kids loved, dancing around with the flashing lights–a quite late night for them though with all the excitement and not wanting to go to bed! It was awesome as well that I could video skype home and see all my family as they opened their presents and then chat with friends in Oz and the USA and fam in NZ!! I love skype!


And it started snowing!!! Woohoo!! (Here is the snow report if you are interested! http://www.bergfex.com/verditz/schneebericht/  )And the chairlift began to operate on Boxing Day which was very exciting. Although, the snow didn’t last- the piste became very hard and icy but at least the guests could all ski in and out and enjoy their holiday. I went down with some of the new guests to the chairlift middle station and got fitted with my skis. Although I had snowboarded a few times since, the last time I had actually skied was whilst I was at University which seemed a very very very long time ago as tried to make my way over to the chair lift. One of the things I was required to do with my job was to take my two girls out skiing and so had asked for a few hours to be able to practice and get a feel for it again. Tugg had told us it was really icy and that we might be better going up to the top of the mountain instead.... clearly he must have meant this as a laugh seeing as he doesn’t ski, but I have no idea how far it is as you ski, but like 7km or something I have been told! It took about half an hour on 2 ski lifts to arrive up there at a height of almost 2000m. And boy was it pretty!! Unfortunately that it where the fun ended as I skidded and slipped across the narrow icy run onto the hard hard ground and into the hard hard forest on the edge. But then my nightmare got worse as the run suddenly became vertical. Yes, VERTICAL!! I had absolutely no idea how to navigate this and after 8 years without skis it was not pleasant!!! Needless to say it took me almost 2 hours to get to the bottom of the stupid slope with my vowing never to go up there ever again!!! A broken soul I got off the chairlift halfway and gingerly began to navigate the bottom half of the slope. Luckily it proved to be skiable but I was definitely confidence-less after my nasty morning. I returned to the hotel to get the girls and promptly told them we are never ever going up to the top of the mountain. Ever!! This is the link for our slopes- http://www.presse.kaernten.at/?arid=10633&amp;LAid=2&amp;jid=WI&amp;siid=1630  

The next day I took the girls down to the Dizibar which is like a regular ski run at home in Oz, but is the token nursery slope here! And we spent the morning running up and down and practicing on the nice gentle slope. But here I was to first learn that in fact the girls were actually Kamakazi kids. You know the ones–they just point their skis forward and go straight down the mountain with no fear and no idea! Soon India had had enough and was lying face down in the snow refusing to go any further and so we returned home with me asking Michelle for a lesson for the girls to learn to turn and ski normally!!!

And all of the sudden it was New Years!! The hotel was filled to capacity with about 60 people, a lot of them Aussie’s and kiwi’s and a few Poms here on a ski tour with a tour company called Party Professionals and were a lot of fun. We had another 3 course feast for dinner and then had a party in the bar. With some people starting celebrating NY in Oz, NZ and random places all around the world from 10 in the morning!!! We also had some really odd people drop in off the mountain, a crazy old man, a grandma and a guy whose hair he must have spent hours blow drying and hairspraying into place that we spent the night trying to escape. So weird!! It was really really busy, so I gave the girls dinner upstairs in their bedroom, put them in their pyjamas and put them to bed. But they again were too excited to sleep! They came downstairs several times throughout the evening until about 11pm when they finally drifted off to sleep. The plan was that they were to go to bed at normal time, Michelle would wake them up to watch the fireworks, they would come downstairs in their pyjamas and robes, stay for an hour or so at the disco and go back to bed. But they had other plans. After watching some dvd’s and staying awake most of the night they had then gotten themselves into their best party clothes ready for the occasion but had fallen asleep on their beds! It was so cute when they came down all dressed up and ready to celebrate! They loved the fireworks and sparklers we had outside - Tugg put on a fireworks display as did most of the other places on the mountain so everywhere you looked fireworks were going off continuously which was really cool! The girls and our neighbours kids Jak and Izzy all came in and danced at the disco again and were somehow up until 2am!!! And then up again about 7am on New Years Day! Yes, as you can probably imagine that day was quite trying for all of us with 2 grisly overtired girls and the rest of the staff equally as grisly and overtired!!

Luckily after a few days they were back into normal cycle, but not I, as it has been so busy here that for three weeks I havnt been able to get my day off each week. And when you are working constantly all day with the girls, not a second to yourself, then when they go to bed helping in the kitchen, running meals then bar etc to late it makes a very long day which extends out non stop for weeks!!!

The tour groups also had a day excursion over to ski two countries–the first of its kind! With Slovenia’s Kanin resort and Italy’s Sella Nevea resort opening a new cable car and piste linking the two ski areas on Dec 24! http://www.skirebel.com/magazine/archives/4664  is some info on it. Unfortunately the first of our groups here missed it as due to avalanche risk it was closed! I was working so wasn’t able to get there but still may if if i get some time! Unfortunately the second time they went was NY day and one of our not so well guests spent the entire drive there and back throwing up into the only thing he could find... an old Pringles can. You can imagine how the rest of the bus loved that!!

Another really weird thing about the slopes here is that the runs go over the road. Yup! Over the road! So as you ski down you see a‘slow’sign and then you have to stop and look both ways for traffic!!!! Crazy! Our piste crosses 3 roads from the middle chairlift to the bottom! It is weird as a driver too as you slow down or if it is foggy you beep and hope nobody hurtles down towards you! It is ridiculous too at night as Austrians have an interesting habit of walking up the mountain on their skis which is crazy enough in itself, but then having a picnic on top, drinking all afternoon and then skiing down at night with a headlamp on their head!!!! So even at night when driving you have to watch for a tiny little yellow light hurtling towards you!! It is weird when I was staying in the attic and my window faced out towards the piste you could hear them all hours of the night scraping down the icy slope. So weird!!!

Dani, our cook is awesome and we eat really well here but it constantly cracks me up as most guests stay for a week there is a weekly menu which we all eat too. And so as I walk downstairs on a particular day of the week I can smell cooking in the kitchen. Ahh, ribs, must be Tuesday! Mmm roast? Thursday it is! And so as a consequence am well over snitzel with noodles (well fries here anyway!) and warm apple strudel, risotto, Maryland chicken and pasta!!!!


The girls make me laugh too with their meals. India will not eat pork ribs (the regular kind of ribs) but will only eat chicken. And so, every Tuesday Dani comes out bearing 2 plates of identical ribs...‘chicken for India and regular for Madeleine!’I have no idea what kind of giant chicken she thinks we get those from!!! And also on pumpkin soup night... Madeleine hates pumpkin soup, but loves mountain soup (whatever that is!) and so as we bring it out.‘Is that pumpkin???’‘No, its mountain!!‘oh yum!!!’SO funny!!


Due to various different guest numbers and room requirements, I have moved rooms three times since I have been here. The funniest was the day I moved right to the top floor where Tugg and I had cleaned the day earlier and sprayed for bugs. The first night I could not sleep as I was kept awake all night by this massive buzzing noise!!! Turns out there was a massive fly infestation in the slopey ceiling above my head and so Tugg had to drill inside to bomb them. And they went crazy!! The whole eave shook!!!! But it did the trick and although the room smelt like fly spray the entire time i was there and they constantly fell dead around me and every time i looked the floor was covered in more remains I never had to listen to them buzzing again!

For some reason the girls don’t just like to do/watch/see/sing etc things once. If they like it they want to do it constantly and forever!! Sometimes it all gets a little bit too much and after seeing the same Simpsons movie for 3 days straight I had to hide the TV adapter from their Christmas TV!!! It is now the 7th of January and we are still playing the Aussie Christmas Carol CD on repeat....‘6 white boomers, snow white boomers, racing Santa Claus in the blazing sun’... I am hearing it in my sleep! And then Monopoly!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kid monopoly followed by Adult monopoly followed by kid monopoly and would do nothing else for 3 days straight!! I thought I was going to go crazy! Needless to say that is now also located somewhere near that strangely missing TV adapter! The Christmas carols are next in line.

We finally had a moment to be able to organise a ski lesson for me with the Kamakazi girls to teach them how to turn as well! We drove out to Bad Kleinkirchheim, otherwise known as BKK, passed 2 massive lakes that are almost totally frozen over as well! There were small groups ice skating on them which looked awesome so we now just need to wait until they are totally frozen and I can take the girls down too! We had a really fun lesson with a german guy called Eric which the girls loved and laughed through, even when the chairlift (one of those ones that you sit/stand on it and it drags you up the mountain) stopped and they both simultaneously fell off. It was the funniest thing I had seen all day! I even learnt to ski pole-less like the kamakazi kids, but it was quite difficult for me as apparently I had been leaning the wrong way with my turns (how i have no idea!!???!) and so I am now having to re-learn over my bad habits how to do it properly so i can teach the girls! The next day FINALLY!!!! it was my day off and so went out on the mountain to practice. And it was snowing!!!! Finally!!!!! But I did not go up to the top!! Never again!!!and boy was it cold as the mist set in. By the time i got back to the hotel my toes, fingers and nose were so frozen I had to stand in the shower forever to try and get them to defrost. Brrr!!!

And another cool little thing that happened was the 6th of January is also the day of the epiphany according to various Christian religions and in Austria it is celebrated as Three King’s Day. It celebrates the day Melchor, Gaspar, and Balthazar visited Jesus as a child bringing gold, frankincense, and myrrh. ( http://holiday-entertaining.suite101.com/article.cfm/january_6th_a_holiday_around_the_world  ) which meant another public holiday, and also a visit from children dressed as kings from the local church to bless the home which was pretty interesting!

All of us here have been watching Hell’s Kitchen as well ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen_(UK ) )–the American reality show where chef Gordan Ramsey ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay  )gets about 14 contestants to work in Hell’s Kitchen with the end result one of them becomes head chef at a top restaurant. However, he is really rude and yells at them and spits out their food out and it is hilarious! Sean, our barman is also really funny and every time he walks into the kitchen, he turns into Gordan Ramsey complaining about imaginary apricots in the mashed potatoes or something equally as random. It definitely cracks us up and was well needed when we were all so tired over New Year!!!

 
Ljubljana and Bled, Slovenia - So Lovely! But alas, land of the icy deathpaths.

2010-01-13 to 2010-01-14

Woohoo! 2 days off in a row! The itchy feet are here so time to travel! I waved goodbye to the gang at the mountain who were all -I found out later- wondering if they would ever see me again - a little sceptical of me heading off to couchsurf and stay in the house of a random stranger!! Getting a lift down from the mountain, the bus arrived exactly at precisely 0916h, like the Austrian clockwork it is and I arrived in at the bus station.... with an hour to spare! Unfortunately the trains and buses donât exactly match up! Trying not to freeze to death I purchased my ticket to Ljubljana, Slovenia! Clearly I am in the wrong line of business for a second class seat on an hour 40 train ride, 20 Euros!!!! None the less I boarded the train and with a whole compartment to myself sat back as we went through the tunnel in the Alps and ...Slovenia! Well, actually it was a massive undergrund section that was pitch black with no lights in the train!!! So Weird! A few stops and we arrived in the capital Ljubljana. And well I can certainly say it was cold!!!!!!! In fact it didnât get over 0âC the entire time I was there. And foggy!! But that was not to deter me as I marched determinedly off the train... and straight into the toilets to stand under the hand dryers for a few minutes! That is when I noticed the next stage thing about Slovenia â the toilet paper is pink! Weird!Gathering my bearings I grabbed a map and headed out and about and... slam. I spent the first of what was to be 2 days of constantly slipping over and spending more time on my butt than my feet! Slovenia. The slipperiest country in the world. Ice, Icy snow, black ice you name it. Salt and grit people!! Letâs move forward!!!With my tiny baby steps I inched forward and located the path up to Grad Ljubljana, or the Ljubljana Castle. And slipped down again on what was to set the scene yet again. And so the 10 minute walk turned into about 30 as I struggled up the path up the side of the mountain overlooking the city. It was just a random bush path which had been covered with snow and then ice! Nice! A quarter of the way up I encountered two people walking, or should I say attempting to walk down. It was quite comical to watch them attempt the icy deathpath as I had dubbed it, but not so much knowing I looked the same!! Stopping to allow them past so I didnât get cleaned up in their stacks as well they told me to âturn back!â âOh reallyâ? I said, âis the castle closed?â âNoâ, they said puzzled, âitâs open!â its just not worth the walk!!! Nonetheless I pressed on and somehow made it alive! I walked around Ljubljana Castle, missing the famous watchtower with views of the city due to the fog and just generally put off heading down! I walked around the entire castle until I found a different route down where instead I could walk off to the side of the path in knee deep snow which was a lot more pleasant! But soon enough the path closed off with giant walls and I was again slip sliding away down the icy deathpath again! I dread to think how long that journey took, but finally I arrived in the Central Food Market, saw millions of pickled cabbages! and walked from the beautiful Dragon Bridge down the Ljubljianica River past the 2 other gorgeous bridges. I paid 17 euro cents to use a bathroom??? 17??? And wandered through the gorgeous old town full of lovely old buildings nad well maintained streets with quirky little shops selling all kinds of things! Across the river I hit Presernov Trg, a main square and spent some time in the newer and new parts of town, walking through the big name shops and up to Park Tivoli which was gorgeous and white and very popular with dozens of locals out walking with prams, jogging or just strolling around the ploughed paths.It started to get dark and even colder and I checked my last message from Roberta, my couchsurfing host (www.cochsurfing.com ) who had offered to pick me up from in town and walked to the meeting point. A silver car arrived, we waved at each other and I decided that was good enough for me and jumped in! Roberta lives in an apartment with her 12 year old daughter Nina in Preglov Trg, Fuzine - about 10-15 mins drive from the centre of town. The apartment is really nice and about 70m2 which is really big for the locals and for just 2 people! They have friends â a family of four living in just 30m2!Slovenia, together with its neighbouring countries made up the former Yugoslavia and since their independence and then subsequent joining of the EU, and gaining of the Euro, the price of living and everyday expenses and necessities has gone up, but wages havenât - which have made everyday life difficult for many Slovenians.We spent a great night chatting â Slovenians it seems from all my enoucnters on the streets and here are really friendly and Nina is a really smart girl and super interested in Australia so it was nice to learn about Slovenia from her and have her so interested in hearing about my home. She loves animals and knew almost more than I did about all our fauna! Like Austria, the schooling system mainly finishes at lunch time, but goes later on one day a week when they do 2 hours of something that they enjoy... such as cooking, art, language, anything! So good! Breakfast and lunch is also included at school every day!! Well, it is paid for in school fees of course, but kids eat both meals there!Roberta is an accountant, and enjoys art and craft in her free time â her favourite being polymer clay! She makes some gorgeous jewellery and was kind enough to give me a beautiful necklace and bracelet she had made also!Nina loves pancakes and so we had pancakes for dinner which Roberta kindly cooked for me! They were crepes and then spread with thick fruity amazingly delicious home-made (by Roberta!) fruit jam/marmalade and then.................... sour cream! Yep, sour cream! I was increasingly dubious about this, but after Ninaâs encouraging spread my pancake, mushed it all together, rolled it up, folded it in half as Nina taught me and... surprisingly delicious!!I also tried a Slovenian home made alcoholic drink called Teran â which was wine, rum, and berries all cooked up together and then enjoyed cold! Quite Tasty!And next thing was a giant tub â about the size of about 1/1.5kg tub of yoghurt which was fat and shredded/minced pork! Yup, sorry there is a giant ewwwww on this one! It had a layer of about an inch of white fat on the top and then swirled fat and little meat (pork) chunks through the container. Yup, I am still having nightmares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Glad I got to experience it though!! It was time to call it a night and my hosts helped me made up the nice practically queen size couch with sheets and a blanket in a doona cover â apparently this is very eastern European as well! And with the step removed so Blue the little pup couldnât jump on my head during the night I had a great nights sleep! Up bright and early as Nina had school and Roberta had work, I was luckily enough to get a lift through peak hour traffic into town, arriving at the bus station just as the bus pulled out!! Doh! But i managed to not freeze to death as the next arrived an hour later and I was on the road to Bled! An hour and a half and only 6.80 euros for a ticket! ...Although I soon found out it would have been half that time on the train! :-) I arrived at a tiny closed up shop in what appeared to be the middle of nowhere and was nodded off the bus... to promptly slip over straight onto my ass. Ahh fun times continue! Everything around me was closed up and I walked hopefully uphill to find my bearings...but no signs and no luck! I found a little tea-shop and decided to try the famous cream cake that Bled is known for. It to me looks exactly like a vanilla slice â pastry with a thick layer of custard...but with an extra half inch of whipped cream! Now not a cream person at the best of times I have to say after eating Australiaâs best Vanilla Slice in Sorrento, Victoria I have to unfortunately say it doesnât compare! Finding some advice in the form of arm waving further uphill I continued on the path and walked/slipped in almost a giant circle until the road brought me to a Grad Bled sign! I was close! The castle was near! The street narrowed and began its steep ascent where I spent the entire journey looking down, making mini steps and trying not to fall over before I made it to the summit and the base of the castle to be greeted with a sign â Caution â icy and slippery way to the castle. Approach at your own responsibility!!! No!!!!!!!!!! :-) With flashbacks to the nightmare icy deathpath of the day before I began in trepidation and millimetre by millimetre made my way up unscathed! Piece of cake compared to Ljubljana Castle! Like the rest of the town, everything was pretty much closed up still, but the lovely lady in the window still charged me 7 euroâs to go in and take a photo of the view! But that was not one I was missing after coming all the way here! And it didnât disappoint. Although Lake Bled didnât have the gorgeous green water that it is famous for in the summer, it was still beautiful to look out over the lake, see the famous island and church and see the beautiful view. With my hands and nose about to drop off from the cold I exited past a singing monk making wine with a talking parrot???? Weird. And began the descent! I somehow located the right road to take me into âtownâ, past all the closed shops and agencies again and woohoo!! The lake!! Success! I walked down to see the gorgeous clear water and see the massive signs explaining the history of the famous cream cake and then found a few open stores to wander around!! Nice!! After some time I found an open tourist information and asked about a few things I had heard about. Nope, closed for winter, nope closed for winter, nope closed for winter! And so walking the 6km around the lake it was! It started out fun â so pretty!!!! Heaps of nice photos, lovely serenity, beautiful scenery, Lake Bled, Bled Island, Bled castle and the snow! But then ...surprise surprise... slip! Here we go again. 6km of ice covered snow paths, taking mili steps to avoid the inevitable. Ah well, when in Bled! I finally made it around, although feeling quite insignificant as I watched the elderly and mothers with prams also tackle the journey and arrive unscathed! In desperate need to defrost my face and hands I found a cozy little place selling mulled wine and settled down with a glass. Soooo.... note to self - turns out âmulled white wineâ with cloves and cinnamon and a big spoon of who knows heated on that milk frother on the cappuccino machine is not so delicious! At least the heat saved me from dying though as I began my journey up to the âmain bus stationâ where I had been dropped off earlier in the day to now catch a bus into Lesce Bled â the closest train station to head home to Austria. Due to the timings I arrived at the train station about 45 mins before my train, brought a return ticket as it was cheaper than a one way...!.... and waited... waited waited.... about 10 mins after it was due came an announcement in Slovenian. Still no idea! About 2o mins after it was due I found a random speaking English who told me the train was delayed. Really?!I also found a traditional Slovenian Christmas food that Roberta had told me about â Potica! It is pretty much dough, all rolled out and then spread with ground nuts, kind of like in baklava. It is then rolled up and baked and.............delicious!!!! Like nutty bread, but better!!! Mmm mmmm mmm!I then also met an Austrian chick getting dental treatment in Slovenia as it was cheaper for her to travel and stay there than it was to go in Austria!!!And so just before the hyperthermia set in it finally arrived! And travelled to the next station and stopped... electricity off, lights off, heating off........ but luckily after about another 15 mins we were on our way!!! Michelle, my boss was sitting at the Villach train station in Austria with the girls after their gymnastics waiting to pick me up! Waiting, waiting waiting as I queued with every other person one the train to ask the conductor when we would be arriving! Luckily in the end we only arrived about 45 mins late, although late enough for most of the train to miss all their international connections!! No good! And back... home sweet home :-)
 
The fastest way down a mountain and other fun stories :-) Verditz, Austria

2010-01-15 to 2010-01-26

Time has passed so quickly here! I cannot believe it has almost been 2 months since I arrived in gorgeous Austria. Sometimes we are full of guests and sometimes there are just a couple, so every day is a little bit different. I have done lots of fun arts and crafts, cooking, games and even a few science experiments with the girls that we saw on a show we get on Cable  Backward Science. Oh and Australia day! My wonderful friend Monty sent over an Australian Survival Pack and so we had the pleasure of eating Iced Vo Vos, tim tams, vegemite, the ISnack 2.0 (hmm... give me plain old vegemite anyday!) And lots of other aussie things. The girls totally loved it and took the tattoos into their class at school which they all put on together. We also spent a few days before making ANZAC biscuits which they took in as well to a great reception and damper for lunch which was also a definite hit.



Sorry this entry is a little disjointed as it is really hard to link totally separate things. I hope you enjoy the stories of what I have been up to though!! xxx



One thing I constantly laugh at here is the high regard lollies are held in! Everyone gives lollies! When the kids do well at school the teacher gives them lollies each day, the neighbours give them lollies, the girls God Club, gym, friends, advertisements in the mail, you name it!!! I had to laugh one day though when India came home from school saying she had done well and instead of pulling out the usual lollies or chocolate the teacher had given toothpaste! Hilarious! Dont worry, it was back to sugar the next day!! :+)



I have also had fun on my days off. Mostly I try and get out skiing if we have had some fresh snow as it doesnt happen much so I have to make the most of it!! Although after a few occasions I now check the weather first! My first day off with skis and snow I was so excited that when I looked out and it was a little foggy I just jumped out anyway! Rugging up, I braved it and skied the bottom slope in the bitter, bitter cold but had to turn in as it was so nasty. I then ran into one of the guests who had been skiing at the top as I headed back trying to defrost my extremities. Turns out it was sunny as anything up there  I had just been skiing in the clouds all day. Doh!!



The next was even worse. Once again it was a little foggy as I left and resigned myself that once again I would be skiing in clouds and so totally rugged up....except the weather had set in! As I started out I noticed it was a little hard to see.... and then nothing. I was skiing in a massive total whiteout and could not see anything  the slope beneath me, the air to the side of me, the edge of the piste, trees, roads, skiers  nothing! It was very, very un nerving to hear skiers sliding on the ice around you and having no idea where they were in relation to you. Luckily the cars had lights on and tooted their horns as they crossed the roads on the piste, so there were no accidents there, but as soon as I had realised I had made it to the bottom without dying I jumped straight back onto the chairlift home. Never again thankyou! No fun at all!!!



So when a beautiful clear day arrived, I rugged up the girls and first took Madeleine out onto the slopes. As we skied down we heard music, saw heaps of people and as we neared the bottom there were clowns handing out chocolates (...of course! this is Austria  land of everyone giving kids sugar!! ) and a chocolate wheel you could spin to win prizes. Madeleine spun and won more chocolates several times, but then spun a clown and was allowed into the special area with a box of keys and 3 treasure chests with different prizes inside. Her key opened up a chest where she chose a thermos just like her dad Tuggs. Mine opened up a chest full of games and Madeleine chose a boxed set of coloured pencils for me. Turns out it was Kids free Ski Day! Super excited with our day, Madeleine and I headed back to swap over with India. India was so excited to get to the bottom I spent the entire run yelling for her to remember to turn and not go straight down! Arriving at the bottom she spun the wheel, but alas, just chocolate- no entry to the treasure chests. On the verge of tears we boarded the chairlift and tried again! Tried to make her ski properly and turn! and then tried to win at the wheel! But alas again no luck, but lots more chocolates as I filled her jacket pockets with them. This time she was already crying and I have no idea how she managed to ski down the slopes and see!! Im sure you can see a pattern occurring here... until the last run. Unfortunately winning nothing but more chocolates. And she was so disappointed the full on crying and associated screaming started  so loud that whilst we were on the chairlift people skiing on the slopes would look up to see what was going on! I have no idea what they were thinking but I am sure I must have looked like some kind of child torturer!!! Luckily I found this mildly amusing wondering what they must have been thinking and then somehow even managed to clam India down enough that she could walk without being carried back to the hotel! ...And to colour with her new pencil set I had won her :+) Phew! Another day at the BM Hotel! :+)



Austria is big on recycling and residents only get so much regular bin space so you have to really focus on it! I think it is definitely a good thing, but sometimes almost on the verge of crazy as you stand in front of the what feels like a thousand bins and try and sort all your rubbish into their appropriate homes! And even worse if you cant figure out where it goes, dont want to contaminate the recycling and then have to try and sneak it into the regular bin without anyone seeing :+).



The hotel is really quite big and when it is not full, all the heating is not on in all the various parts and some places are super cold. Especially after having been outside, sometimes it is so hard to warm up and I end up sitting in the lounge with what feels like hundreds of layers of clothes and a beanie on! So Tuggs recommendation for us is to stand in the boiler room  the one place in the hotel that is always super super warm. But lights waste too much power. In the dark people!! Luckily it makes us laugh :+). Dani calls it Faulty Towers as things around us go wrong and we have to do things random weird certain ways. It certainly keeps us entertained though!



As it neared the time for Dani, the cook to leave, another Topdeck Friend  Welshy  came in to replace her. To celebrate her last night, Sean, Welshy, Tugg, Dani and I headed into the car down to the local Pizzeria at the bottom of the mountain. It was a school night and late by the time we finally finished up and got down there Tugg needed to get back, so it was a superquick eating marathon as we sat there and watched the locals smoke and even the staff smoke in the kitchen!!! And then our food arrived...... and my gosh, it was definitely the worlds saltiest pizza!!!!! Sucking down our drinks we jumped back into the car as the heater blasted us. For some technical reason I dont understand it needs to be like that! And it is lovely when you get in, but not as we sat there driving up the mountain dressed in all our winter clothes after having eaten what felt like a years supply of salt. It was touch and go I tell you whether we would make it as we all sat in the car dying of thirst. I have never seen people move faster as we pulled up and all pushed each other out of the way to get to the tap and gulp down the water. Think well eat at home from now on!! :+)



Sometimes during the day we also have some odd tasks. Such as the day we required to put together beds and move them between levels. It was definitely a case of the blind leading the blind as we grabbed random bits from the loft, slid them down the stairs, or hurled the mattresses over the railings. After some time and swapping of various pieces we had made something that resembled a bed, and the boys a bunk. Shotgun not sleeping in any of them!!!!



As a treat one afternoon after school, we all picked the girls up and headed off to Klagenfurt to the massive swimming pool complex that is there. It was definitely a bit weird getting out of the car dressed in your swimmers as you crunched over the snow and ice to enter! It was a really odd set up too  the dressing rooms are communal, just with separate little rooms for you to get changed in and then you walk through a foot wash to get to the pools... The several inch deep foot wash is on the bottom level though so you then walk up 2 flights of slippery tiles to get to the pools!!!! It was a really cool complex though  lots of different pools of different temperature, including a big 50m pool. Diving boards, water slide, a cave and a whirlpool you can swim against! We had a great time frolicking about until I looked around and noticed all the Europeans and their attempts at swimming costumes. So gross!! And ridiculous! It looked like we had gone through some kind of time warp to when all kinds of weird colors, designs and runway items no one would ever actually wear in public were in!!! And then it looked like others were wearing their undies!!! I spent the rest of the afternoon with my eyes shut!! Bring back the aussie beach anyday!



After talking about all going out together, Sean, Welshy and I discussed a plan to head into town and have all you can eat sushi! But unfortunately town is not very close and as this was to fall after our massive outing to the pool, Sean and I were shattered. Instead we decided on a day Hiking and bumboarding! For those, like I, that had never heard of this- it is basically sitting on a hard piece of plastic with a handle and sliding down the mountain! We finally talked Welshy around and grudgingly he gave in and we headed out! And what a beautiful day! The sky was crystal clear and sunny as we arrived at the top of the mountain to walk through the gorgeous snow, stopping to appreciate the view, take lots of pictures and get laughed at by the Austrians who were walking around on their skis and get to live here their whole lives!!! We began our descent and it didnt take too long before we cracked out the bumboards. It was a little precarious as the path was a hiking path and therefore not made to be slid down at any speed at all! We attempted to figure out how to steer and realised it wasnt to happen as we bounced over rocks, shaved past trees and narrowly missed the steep edges to oblivion!!! The best way to stop is feet... and then if there is too much speed  bail out!!! I am surprised we all survived injury free!!! It was an amazing afternoon walking through the beautiful woods, total silence except for us and then sliding through it!!! So much fun!!!! We arrived back, the hike being possibly world record timing as we had spent most of the time sliding and straight into a relaxing spa and sauna. Possibly the best day off over!!



We have had some more cool guests too, ones we spent a fair bit of time with were Dennis and Rebecca, Dennis who is the Manager of Wicked Campers Europe, www.wickedcampers.co.uk which are those really funky painted cans you see on the roads that you can hire to drive around on your travels and sleep in the back! They use our hotel as one of the pick up and drop off point for travellers driving their vans around Europe but were just here chilling out for a few days. We had fun playing games, tobogganing with the girls and it even worked out as my day off so Dennis and I could go right up to the top of the mountain together  which I had not done since that first fateful day on skis!! I was worried I would not enjoy it again starting off, but it all just turned out to be good fun and nowhere near as bad as what I remembered it to be!!
 
Snowshoeing. The verdict? No thanks! Verditz, Austria

2010-01-27 to 2010-01-28

After previously being out and about and seeing snowshoe tracks in the snow I decided that it would be nice for us to hire some snowshoes and go trekking! Skiing down and grabbing some sets from Zig Linda at the hut at the bottom I handily ran into Tugg who brought them up in the car  convenient seeing as they were quite cumbersome to try and ski and not die with!

I found Sean straight away and we looked for Welshy  turns out he was still in bed! Banging on the door at 1pm we convinced him that he was awake and that he would love to come out snowshoeing with us! Grumbling he dragged himself out, into his snow clothes and we affixed the snowshoes. Well, we started. 10 mins later we were done. 2 steps later Welshys had fallen off. 10 mins later and super frozen fingers they were on. 5 steps later they were off! And so the first casualty ended up under a tree! Sean and I persevered. Then we came to a hill. Seans were delicately placed under the next bush! I managed somehow up the piste to the chairlift, almost tripping over constantly, 10 times slower than the other two and having to work 4 times harder trying to walk and lift my legs!

And brr! Through the cloud up to the top of the mountain to begin. Having dragged Welshy out in a rush he had grabbed some snacks and so looked a comical sight as he sat on the chairlift having his breakfast picnic as we all snuggled under the blankets that the chairlift provides in a vain attempt to escape the bone chilling cold.

Off the chairlift at the very top without falling and into the deep deep snow I thought for sure the shoes would then come into their own. But no. And walking through thigh deep snow to leave them where they belonged under a tree was also no fun at all!! But undeterred we continued, much faster, with less effort and a lot happier! Snowshoes. Verdict? No thanks!!

We were walking the 6km cross country circuit on top of our mountain and over the ridge to the next rise. Unfortunately for us it had snowed alllllll the previous day and there was beautiful deep, deep soft sinking snow everywhere! It looked gorgeous glistening in the sun, but not so gorgeous when you had to walk through it! We found a path and it was one step- ankle deep, 2 step- ankle deep, 3 step  argh!! Thigh deep. And so it continued. Welshy became a casualty of the slow heavy going and had to return to cook dinner as Sean and I continued the expedition like Scott in the Antarctic! We passed some gorgeous snow covered trees on the path and amazing views over the Alps. We also spent a lot of time falling over when we attempted to get our stuck legs out! Not fun!

But finally, an hour later we managed to make it to the top of the peak and furtherest point on our trail! So pretty! And then we slowly turned around and returned. The track going back to complete the loop looked even more covered in snow and so we stuck to our path, laughing at our previous footprints that ended up as massive holes in the ground and the spots where we had fallen and attempted not to do it again! We began a look out for Welshy in case he had fallen after he had left us and needed us to drag him home, but luckily he was either entirely covered in snow or had made it out alive!

It was SO cold too. SO cold that your eyeballs freeze. Your nose and cheeks have no feeling and your fingers and toes hurt they are that cold. You cant even move your fingers they are that frozen into position and consequently cant do up zippers or anything that has come undone. Your lips also lose feeling and it feels like you are attempting to talk after you have been to the dentist and your whole face is numb! Even wearing ski pants, several layers of socks, several layers of thermals, shirt, ski jacket, gloves, hiking boots, neck warmer and thermal headband whilst walking it still happens!! Definitely one of the coldest places I have ever been in my life!

As we hiked it looked like a desert in some parts as all you could see was snow, the sky, sun and moon in your entire vision. Beautiful! The sun had started to begin to set and we enjoyed the colours and patterns in the sky until Sean made some random comment and I looked at my watch. ARGH!!! Reality hit!!! The last lift was leaving in less than 10 mins and we needed to get it to get back to the hotel!!!! We began the slow and painful process of attempting to run back towards it, hoping in vain to make it, but knowing we probably couldnt and were going to be trapped up the mountain, having to retrace our sorry steps and begin over another good hours trek down the side of the mountain in the fading light to try and get home safely.

Lungs and legs burning, frozen fingers, toes and noses screaming we attempted to run. Trying to get the snowshoes I didnt know if I would make it as I crawled through the massive snow drift to avoid sinking any lower. But success! I had snowshoes and a semi path to move along. Running ahead to try and stop the lift closing I saw Sean make it to the bottom of the steps just as the lift started to slow down! Gesturing wildly he was allowed on as I made it up and jumped on the next seat. Phew! I have no idea how we managed to do it but all I can say is thank goodness for that! We sat there watching the sun set through the coloured sky and began our descent through the bitterly cold cloud layers to be yelled at in German by the chairlift staff at the bottom. Turns out he was going to be a massive 5 mins late shutting down because of us! Sean started limping as he got off the chair attempting to prove he couldnt walk, and therefore justify having to take the lift so late, but it did nothing to placate him... and then Sean had to try and keep it up the entire way until we were out of his vision, frozen feet and all :+)!

It was only a few hundred metres back to the hotel, but it felt like an eternity as we practically crawled back through the forest and fell through the hotel door into the warmth before frostbite set in. We made it!
 
30 kids, ski rescue, waltz floors and passive smoking. The way forward for Austria. Updated!

2010-01-30 to 2010-02-08


After our last guests left, we completed some exciting tasks such as brasso-ing the strips on the stairs, steam cleaning seats, sewing up couches and general maintenance before...inundation! 30 kids arrived, screaming and running up and down the halls all super excited to be off on a ski week. There was a mix of ages from 6-about 12! I couldn’t believe the tiny little ones were away from home for a week! Unfortunately as they were from Vienna, most of them did not speak English so we had to spend the week trying to figure out what it was that they wanted every time they came up to us.

The entire group often woke up around 5am, and didn’t settle until the early hours of the morning so it was long long days! They also had 3 meals a day, as opposed to the usual breakfast and dinner that other guests have so it seemed to be a never ending cycle of prep, cooking , arranging, waitressing, dishes and cleaning!

Madeleine had also fallen over ice skating whilst she was out with her Grandma and Aunt who were visiting and although not broken, the Austrian doctor had decided to place her arm in a plaster cast for a week....? And so unfortunately she could not really participate in any activities with the other children. And less then a week later, the cast taken off. So weird!??!

The kids were all sick and so one by one all of us came down with their cold like symptoms which was not fun! I ended up with an awful cough that wouldn’t leave and so visited the doctor. It was amazing! I walked in, was gestured to the waiting room where I sat for about 5 mins before being taken to the Doctor’s office. The Doctor then listened to me cough, listened to my chest and said‘bronchitis’! I then followed him to the back room where he pulled out about 4 different types of drugs, explained them to me, which meant nothing, but luckily dosage numbers are universal!, signed something, paid 12 Euros and that was it! Probably the most efficient Doctor’s visit I have had in my entire life! In and out in about 15 mins and all with neither of us even speaking a word of each others language!!! Hilarious!!!! Even if the Austrian’s do overdose on the drugs! Unfortunately I was now down at the bottom of the mountain with my options either being wait 3 hours til Welshy and Michelle returned from shopping, or walk to the chairlift which was operating for the first day to the very base of the mountain. Option 2! Avoiding all the street and footpath clearing snow machines I started walking and walking.... 15 mins in at the doc.... an hour and a half to get back up the mountain home.

It was Sean the barman’s birthday and as it happened to fall on a Saturday when there were no guests in, Tugg, Welshy, Sean, our neighbour James and I got ready to hit downtown Villach! We found the street with the Pub’s and systemically walked into every single one until we found one with decent music and that looked normal. We went through Austrian, Irish, Brazillian, you name it! We ended up at a place with a live band singing mostly English songs which was awesome so had a great time singing along there until Sean decided that it was his birthday and we were going nightclubbing. We caught a cab out to a recommended place and walked into one of the weirdest setups I have seen. There was a massive circular dancefloor in the middle with benches all the way around so people constantly watched you dance... but it was a waltz floor! Everyone was with partners waltzing to the music! And not traditional classical, but everyday songs... well mostly everyday songs–they did play‘ag a do do do, push pineapple shake a tree..! They also had people wearing shirts that said the German equivalent of‘dance taxi’which meant that they were employed there by the nightclub to dance with people! We started chatting to some Austrian’s and joined in the Greek dancing and then a traditional Western Austrian song (which coincidently I then heard playing at the restaurant on the slopes the next day!) where we held each others shoulders in partners, jumped our feet out to the side for a bit and then grabbed arms and spun each other around, barn dance style. Very odd!

About an hour or so later, James came up to us and had found another section–if you went through a wide passageway by the toilets, there was a whole other area jam packed with people dancing on a regular dancefloor, with dance music and poles in cages which were always full! It was really weird! Waltz floor and pole dance cages!

It took quite a while to get home and the whole night had been snowing. As we sat in the taxi at the base of the mountain, the wheels started turning and the driver stopped. He refused to go any further up the mountain. And so there we were. 4am and at the base of a 6km snow covered mountain in our party clothes!!!! Tugg, and I started walking, James started running. Sean started complaining and refusing to walk and Welshy started to drag him. The boys all started singing in between Sean’s cursing and the noise got further and further away as Tugg and I just started walking so we could get home and not have to listen to Sean!! We were powering up and had only been going for about 45 mins when we saw headlights coming towards us. Allison, James’wife had very kindly gotten out of bed and come down to pick us up when she knew we were coming home!! And were all unanimously overjoyed. The walk in the pitch black was not fun at all!!!

We finally got home and gratefully into our warm beds, waking up the next morning with the disgusting reminder that we had been out in Austria–the cigarette smell permeating through everything in our rooms. Cigarette? No need. The joy of passive smoking. Welcome to Austria.

One uneventful afternoon I was taking the girls out skiing and had India with my right at the top of the mountain–the first time I had taken either of the girls there as they had not shown me their skiing was good enough before that. We started out so well and were half way down right on the steepest bit when I looked up to see what India what doing and magically at that moment hit a patch of ice. Not exactly sure what happened next, but I had hundreds of awful scenario’s flashing through my head as I sped out of control off the side of the piste...into 2 trees, a barricade, pole and waist deep snow. I lay there for a few minutes trying to figure out if I was still alive and realised that I was completely and utterly stuck. My legs were in a lot of pain twisted at funny angles around the trees and I could not even see them as I was lying forward on my stomach and the snow was waist deep. It was several minutes before I realised I was okay that I could start laughing. I then realised I was so well and truly stuck I had no way of moving or getting out at all. India was standing on the side of the slope waiting as people in the chairlift looked down horrified, then realised I was okay and started laughing! As I was off the side no one noticed me at first, but finally I looked up and a rescuer had magically appeared. He rushed towards me, then realised I was okay and started laughing also. After some time he managed to locate both my legs, free my skis, pull them and my boots and legs out, untwist me and we dragged ourselves back onto the piste. I stood up and realised I was okay! I have never felt so amazing in all my life! He was stunned too and kept asking–are you sure you are okay? Do you need the ski rescue? And we waved goodbye as we each continued down the slope. I have no idea how I managed to come out of that unscathed but I am so very very happy I did! I was worried I wouldn’t be able to walk the next day with the delayed onset of everything, but a few bruises on my shin and knees and some sore ribs and that was it. A-mazing! Although I do have tree imprints on my ski pants to prove it :-)

 
Carnevale, Venice, Italia!!

2010-02-09 to 2010-02-12


Due to being super busy when the school group was here and having no day off, we–Sean the barman, Welshy the cook, another Topdeck friend Carla who worked a few hours away, and I had three days off in a row and coincided it with the Venice Carnival!!

As Venice was less than a 3 hour drive away, and the cost of public transport being ridiculous, we hired a car for less than half the cost we would have spent! Being dropped off in the centre of Villach, we walked up the hire car row trying to find the location of our supplier, but to no avail. Asking at the BP Servo, the girl gestured to the little bar tables where customers eat their hot dogs etc. Turns out that was the‘office’of our rent a car company! Oh oh! With little German, we attempted to understand what was going on as masses and masses of paperwork was filled out and a 700 Euro deposit was taken in case we crashed!! What the??!!!! On top of the excess waiver and full comprehensive insurance we had taken out! About half an hour later we were handed the keys to our brand new car. Italia here we come!

Heading out on the highway we made a few random guesses and... woohoo! Signs to Italy! It was super exciting for us to be getting out and about and off the mountain as it is really isolated and at 6km up you can never really actually leave!
We stopped at the fantastic Italian service stops–Autogrill–and began gorging ourselves on delicious fresh Italian food. We were all so excited to be eating something different to Austrian food that we have had back to back for the last few months!! And although ridiculously cold, it was nice not to be walking with snow under our feet also!!

Watching the beautiful snowy Alps rushing by our windows in no time at all we were arriving at our Venice home–Camping Alba D’Oro. www.ecvacanze.it/en/elite_family/venice/camping-alba-doro is where we stay for all our Topdeck trips so it was nice to be somewhere familiar as well. Making the most of the day, Carla and Welshy headed to the bar as I headed in to catch the bus into Venice city. The two buses connected up perfectly and in no time I had arrived in Piazza Roma to enter the maze that is Venice. I had just been to Venice on two other occasions–the first time it was easily a BILLION degrees, and the second time I never even managed to get into Venice city as everything was flooded!! So it was a very different Venice again that I saw today.

Venice is a cluster of 117 small islands and 150 canals connected by 409 bridges!! So the story goes, the city was built here to protect against the marauding non swimmer Attila the Hun!! The old streets wind through the town and many people find it very difficult to navigate so I didn’t even bother! I just randomly walked and had a fantastic time looking at all the little shops, piazza’s and people that were there. I tried a local speciality, a fluro green pistachio thing that was a kind of cross between bread and a biscuit and tasted like almond!!

I passed the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge - which is the oldest one of three bridges in the world occupied with shops–and began to see various people all dressed up in Masks, capes and beautiful costumes.

Venice is famous for its beautiful masks, and Carnevale is the time that they are brought out onto the streets! The festival takes place on the 10 days leading up to Shrove Tuesday and the name Carne vale–‘farewell to meat’explains the opportunity to use up such treats before the start of Lent (like an extended Pancake day!). It also celebrates the passage of winter to spring, a time when seemingly anything is possible, including the illusion where the most humble of classes become the most powerful by wearing masks on their faces where no differentiation could be made between nobility and the common people.

I saw some amazing masks with people dressed as clowns, jesters, royalty, famous historical figures, 19th C personnel, play characters, traditional Venetian style and you name it, it was there! It was so awesome just to wander around and see these people just walking around amongst everyone, posing for a photo and then walking on!! It was a great atmosphere!
I have never seen Saint Marks square look so beautiful either! At the far end was a massive stage filled with gorgeous lights and all decorated. A giant winged lion, the city’s symbol was also there made out of bright fruits and flora. It was fantastic!!

All too soon it was time to wander back to Piazza Roma and doh! Just missed the first bus! Half an hour later I was able to attempt to defrost as I headed to the airport, which is the bus change over point for my route. And doh again! Another wait! Finally the next bus arrived and I jumped on.... but it just didn’t seem quite right. Oh oh, wrong direction!! Off again and another half hour wait!!! Finally the Camping Alba D’Oro sign appeared in the distance and I pushed the buzzer. Turns out my driver was in no mood to stop and continued on for another 5 mins to the Casino. Yay! Walking home in the freezing cold pitch black along the side of a highway!! But finally I arrived, finally! Over 2 hours to get home!!

The next morning it was pouring with rain!! Ready to be cold and wet, we diligently headed out and about where Carla and Welshy gave me a walking tour of Venice. We saw the floating fruit and veg market, the old church and tunnel where Indiana Jones pops out of, and the shop that made the masks for the Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise movie‘Eyes Wide Shut’.

We passed heaps of awesome buildings and sights before arriving in Saint Marks Square to see all the performers. Unfortunately with the rain they were all seeking shelter under cover and surrounded by heaps of paparazzi tourists, but it was really cool to see them all out again!

The main square is Piazza San Marco, or Saint Mark’s Square which is usually totally full of, and famous for its pigeons. However we didn’t see a single one at all!!! The authorities have been feeding them contraceptives and it looks like it is working too well! Interesting trivia fact - the Bell tower in the square is also where Galileo demonstrated his telescope!

Saint Marks Basilica is the resting place of Saint Mark - the patron saint of the city. As it turns out, he was also a replacement saint after the early fathers felt the previous patron saint, Saint Theodore, was not up to scratch! It is a gorgeous building, both outside and in, covered in gold and mosaics that tell the story of the mission to get the body of Saint Mark back from Alexandria, Egypt where he died. It was eventually achieved by stowing it in a pork barrel as the Muslims would not touch this!! Even after managing this, it was somehow lost again on several occasions during renovations, but is now safely located in a crypt inside. There are also crazy Mosaic tiles on the floor that Welshy tried to convince me were the first of those‘magic eye’puzzles where if you squinted really hard you could see the story of Saint Mark told out in them as well! :-)

The Doges (the chief magistrate and leader) Palace next to the Basilica is beautiful and used to be where prisoners were tried. Next to it was a prison, which was one of the worst in the world with its conditions as it constantly flooded. The bridge linking the two is famously known as the‘Bridge of Sighs’where prisoners being led across to the prison could glimpse the beautiful Venetian Lagoon for the last time and sigh about their future! The prisons most famous inhabitant was legendary ladies man Casanova... who was also the only one to ever escape! Unfortunately all around the Bridge is covered with scaffolding and ads for the renovations so not quite as amazing as it could be!

Besides the masks, probably the next most famous thing in Venice is glass. In the majority of shops you will see some form of glass for sale, the most popular being jewelery! Murano glass comes from one of the main islands in Venice....Murano! :-) It is famous around the world and the main glass producing centre in Europe, made here since 1291- the skill deemed so valuable that glassmakers were charged with treason if they tried to leave town!

Ridiculously cold and wet we found a delicious little restaurant www.osteriadogemorosini.it where I had a fantastic fresh seafood ragout! Mmmm mmm mm! After defrosting we decided it was time to go home and get warm! And were in luck as we ran to catch the first bus... But it was definitely too good to be true as we then waited well over 45 mins at the airport for the next one, I guess timetables for that driver were just suggested guidelines!! But finally home sweet home as we were able to get warm and head to the bar where we joined in a game of‘name that song’with a French school that were staying at the campsite as well. The manager Silvio invited us to join him for dinner and the chef cooked up an amazing feast of fresh pasta with tomato and tuna, followed by lots of different pizza’s!!! Yum!!! Stuffed to the brim we rolled home happily dreaming of Italian food!!

The next morning our little adventure was over. Sean, who had stayed with a friend, arrived to pick us up and we were all pleased to see that the car had also survived and we could so far keep that 700 Euro crash deposit we had paid!!!

We went crazy in a real supermarket, buying all kinds of delicious things like fresh fruit and essentials like toothpaste that are difficult to get when you live up a mountain before we began the drive home! It was another gorgeous drive as I saw my first ever frozen waterfalls in the mountains by the side of the road. And found the snow had arrived!!! The roads became a little snowier and icier and before we knew what was happening we had slid across the road and narrowly missed a head on with an oncoming car. Once more we also slipped out of control, but lucky enough there was no one near us and no damage done. We were pleased to arrive safely at the bottom of the mountain, but there was no way that our car was going to be making it up as we parked and waited for Tugg to come and pick us up! We began out ascent and were amazed–in the 2 days since we had been there, there had been several feet of snow and it looked fantastic! Definitely not so good for driving in though as we were again exceptionally pleased to arrive home safely! And guess what was ready for dinner... yup. Pizza!!!!

 
The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music... and Ten Tenors! Salzburg, Austria

2010-02-22 to 2010-02-24


The train journey from Villach to Salzburg is stunning as the track passes through the gorgeous snow covered alps. A little under 3 hours later I was walking through the streets of Salzburg to my hostel, YoHo&apos;s... where I discovered it only costs 50 cents to hire a towel! Bargain! :-)

It was already dark but I decided to head out exploring anyway and walked out towards the station. But didn&apos;t really find much... should have looked at a map though as the service station attendant gestured to me in German that town was the other way. Oops!

I did notice though that Salzburg appears to have the world&apos;s concentration of &apos;Pizza, Pasta, and Doner Kebab&apos; shops! Every few shops near the station precinct!!!!

I randomly came upon a few girls i recognised from checking in at the Hostel and so stalked... i mean followed :-) them on their route. It was great–I loitered in shop windows as they consulted their map and by the end I had completed a walking tour of pretty much the entire town on both sides of the Salzach River! Brilliant! And I now knew where everything was and how to get places! Oh and they didn&apos;t speak English in case you were wondering. :-)

Salzburg was gorgeous, with hundreds of beautiful old buildings all lit up with lights and the massive fortress at the top overlooking the entire city.

Arriving back my room mates were all in, some lovely Korean girls who we tried to have a conversation in German/ English/ Korean, but as none of us really had a grasp of any besides our own it didn&apos;t last much beyond smiles and nods!

5am the next morning they were up though!!!! They may have tried to tell me, as i did hear the word &apos;tomorrow&apos; at one stage but I had no idea about the rest! Crazy!!! And they weren&apos;t even checking out. I have no idea where they could have gone!! And I guess I never will :-)

Heading down for breakfast I located an Aussie girl and a Turkish guy who both spoke English, the guy I would randomly run into on many many occasions over the next 2 days!

.......And then it was time!!! I have always loved the movie &apos;The Sound of Music&apos; and my brother, sister and I constantly watched it as we were growing up. I always wanted to go to Salzburg and see it all so I was really excited to be finally here! Four other Chinese girls were being picked up with me, who all turned out to be Music students–Piano their focus–who had just completed a semesters study in Germany. We jumped into the van and joined three other Aussie boys- Jordan, Boyd and Keane - who as it turns out happened to be three of the band &apos;The Ten Tenors&apos; (www.thetentenors.com )who are currently touring Europe!

Our guide was an American chick called Kristen and she was so rude!! One of the Chinese girls asked what yodeling was and she explained it very badly, so one of them demonstrated for the others, and it was actually really good! She just cut her down, talking loudly over the top of her saying, &apos;No you are wrong.&apos; &apos;Sweetie&apos;. She seemed to think that no matter what she said, in what tone as long as she put &apos;sweetie&apos; on the end it was fine. And then Kristen went on to Yodel herself over the microphone and it was nowhere near as good!! I had to laugh. :-)

Jordan at one stage commented on something she had just mentioned and she was really patronizing &apos;Of course you didn&apos;t know that. That is why you are here. &apos;Sweetie&apos;!

We started in the city centre and saw the fountain where Maria got off the bus and sang &apos;I have confidence&apos; before dancing up to the Captain&apos;s house which was quite funny as actually it would have been closer for her to walk from the Abby to the house than catch the bus into the city centre and then retrace her steps!

We saw the red roofed Nonnberg Abbey where Maria lived, the mountains where she was singing in the beginning and heard the bells tolling and ran back to the Abbey.... in about a minute! Except the mountains were at least a 30 min trek! :-) The Abbey is also the actual location that the Captain and Maria were married in real life.

There was the bridge over the Salzach River with the city of Salzburg in the background where Maria and the kids all sung and crossed waved to the ferry passing underneath (not sure how though, it is less than a metre deep in places!!), the Mirabell Gardens where they sat on the stairs, sung do rae mi, danced at the Pegasus fountain and gardens and patted the stone dwarfs on their heads. Unfortunately it was a little hard to picture as the gardens were all dead and closed up for the winter, and all the fountains off, but we still tried our imaginations best!

There was also what was left of the stone arches and kind of ampitheatre where the Nazi&apos;s all stood when the Von Trapp family was singing... before we headed to the Von Trapp family house on the lake! It is called the Leopoldskron Palace and again looks really different in winter with no greenery and the lake all frozen over, but it was pretty cool still! The house was used as the outside and ballroom only and another French style house was used as the inside! So the director had to constantly remember and see what was in the background and cut and edit to make it all match up and look like the one house! The place where the Gazebo was is also there, but it has since been demolished, then rebuilt in the Hellbrunn Palace Gardens.

Another interesting little story was that the traditional Austrian Waltz Maria and the Captain dance to at the Captain&apos;s party is made up as well!

And -this is another apparantly - after the film came out a lot of people were under the impression that Edelweiss was the National Anthem of Austria. In the USA it is customary for the visiting delegates national anthem to be played as they arrive/enter (sorry cant remember exactly!) and when the first ever Austrian delegates visited the USA in 1982 Edelweiss was played as they just stood there in confusion!

Little Gretel, the youngest daughter in the film couldn&apos;t actually swim and when the boat scene is done in the lake at the back of the house where the boat tips and they all fall out, she almost drowns! She goes under a few times and struggles and then the camera cuts to the Captain&apos;s face as one of the crew dived in to rescue her!!

 

Apparantly she also put on 15 pounds during filming as well as each time she was upset someone made her her favourite drink -a hot choc with whipped cream on top and over the course of the months it all just added up! So the story goes at the end when the Captain was carrying her they had to use a double as she was so heavy he refused to carry her!

We then headed out to the Gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace where we also found out that Liesl was given new patent leather shoes to wear and as she is singing and dancing around the Gazebo, her shoes slip and she goes through the glass! Luckily Ralph is holding her hand and stops any more damage! She sprains/strains both her ankles and also gets a long, deep gash that they just covered in butterfly stitches, strapped her up, gave her bobby socks to wear to cover it all and took her back out there! That is why that is the only scene in the entire movie she is wearing bobby socks instead of stockings! She was also not a professional singer, actor or dancer! She did catalogue modeling to earn money whilst she studied and that was it!

 

Hmm a postcript to that last story though - i watched the movie today and i dont think she is!! And i googled it and found nothing!! hmmm.........!

Right across the road is also the tree lined street where the children were all hanging in the branches when the Captain drove past. The branches have all been cut so we couldn&apos;t climb though!

Next was a bit of a drive to the gorgeous areas of St Gilgen, Lake Wolfgang and Lake Fuschl were scenes for the beginning of the movie were shot. And then the Mondsee Cathedral where the wedding scene was shot in the movie. Except it didn&apos;t look all that familiar to me!! I will have to watch the movie again, but there was certainly no place where people could have been behind iron bars like they were in the movie!!

And it was over! We did learn a few interesting pieces of information, but the guide just recited chunks from her guidebook and so it was difficult to stay focussed! We did listen to all the Sound of Music Songs as we passed all the pertinent places too which was fun to sing along to.

Unfortunately a lot of the scenes such as the cemetery where they were hiding out from the Nazi&apos;s were actually sets made and filmed in America, but we did also see a yellow building that was the authentic Von Trapp family residence as we zoomed past!

Chatting with Boyd and Jordan as we left they had started their current tour a few weeks ago in Scandinavia and had a show on that night at the Republic Theatre and were going to try and get me a ticket!

I then headed off to see Mozart&apos;s house where his family moved when he was a teenager,and then to the other side of the river to see the Museum where he was born and grew up. It was quite cool, my favourite being an upside down room representing his &apos;Starry Sky&apos;. I have no idea the significance....Google says to represent the upside down way in which he viewed the world or saw things differently. But it was definitely very cool! They also had a few locks of his hair which was weird! And some of his original compositions from when he was very young which was amazing. There was even this really cool little wooden room you walked through a narrow passageway to enter and it just blocked out the sound of the world with beautiful Mozart compositions.

Walking through the town, there are so many beautiful buildings, amazing churches, statues and fountains, one of the most gorgeous I saw was Dom Zu Salz, which I cannot find an English explanation so I don&apos;t know its purpose in life, but it is beautiful!

Next I walked up to the Hohensalzburg Fortress (www.festung-salzburg.at ) which was high! It was practically spring in Salzburg at a balmy 5 degrees and it was beautiful! Except if you have just hiked in layers of thermals and down!! The fortress of easily the best I have been to so far in Europe! Hands down! It was massive and you could actually go into a lot of it. Actually I just read that it is the largest fortification in Europe so that probably explains it! :-) It is also the residence of Salzburg&apos;s Prince Archbishops.

I ran into Boyd there who told me about a free audio tour you could do that the information had neglected to mention to me! And it was really interesting, in the cold, cold inside of the fortress there were rooms full of scale models of the fortress through each of its rulers and improvements, a room full of old torture equipment, and then up the long windy staircase to the very top where you got the most amazing view of all of Salzburg and its surrounding mountains. On the way out we passed an old organ which used to be played each morning to rouse the townsfolk ready for work and in the evening for them to know it was bed time!!!!


It was time to somehow find a respectable outfit out of my overnight bag and go to the Ten Tenors Show! I was super excited, and not exactly where to go, but located a few well dressed couples walking the right direction so just followed them until I arrived! The venue was the Republic Theatre and my name was on a list at the door. I was asked where I wanted to sit, but I said I didn&apos;t mind. As I walked in I realised I had an amazing seat, in the third row right down the front!! And a ticket that said 65 euro&apos;s! How nice was that!! Unfortunately it was Jordan&apos;s night off -there are actually 11 tenors so they can rotate and in case one gets sick, but it was amazing!!! They started out with Thunderstruck, and did some amazing songs like Bohemian Rhapsody, Angels by Sarah McLachlan, a few beautiful classic songs that you know, even if you don&apos;t know what they are called! and so many more great songs that everyone knew and was singing or clapping along too. They also did Seal&apos;s &apos;Kiss from a Rose&apos; which was so lovely it almost made me cry! It was pretty much packed out and the audience loved it, cheering constantly between the songs. laughing along with them in their speeches and giving them a standing ovation at the end. It was absolutely amazing!! I totally loved it, and was so random how I had had the most amazing day and night so out of the blue!

It was odd having sat with a few of the boys on the tour van that morning just chatting talking about normal things and then here they were on stage, singing phenomenaly and on a world tour!!! It just blows your mind :-) It was pretty awesome too that Boyd saw me from the stage and gave a wave! I randomly ran into Jordan at intermission and then we quickly caught up at the end before they headed off, ready to hit the road to two months of shows in Germany in the morning. That is pretty much their largest fan base! It was funny as i headed off there was a couple of the guys from the band standing out the back smoking! I would never have thought professional singers would be doing that! I just laughed and told them the show was great–i think they were a bit shocked to be hearing an Aussie accent in the middle of Austria!

I was still on a massive buzz as I headed off home to the hostel, still humming the songs in my head, but the next morning it was time to hit the road again. I walked around the old town centre again, marveling at the hundreds of &apos;mozart chocolate&apos; shops that were around every corner... it looks to me like a marzipan ball covered in chocolate and then covered with foil that has a picture of Mozart&apos;&apos;s head on it. And apparently it is amazing! And also seeing all the delicious bread in the bakeries and also avoiding the rain! I have been lucky, it only seemed to rain whenever I was inside somewhere! And then it became sunny as i walked! I was talking to the couple i saw next to at the Ten Tenors show and they said I was lucky–it always rains all the time in Salzburg and you can&apos;t usually escape it!

And then it was time again! Time to sit back and enjoy the view on the train, say farewell to an absolutely amazing time in Salzburg that I am sure I will never top or forget and head back home to the mountain!

 

 
The last weeks in isolation! Leaving Verditz, Austria

2010-02-25 to 2010-03-13

The time continued to pass with much the same activities, a bit of nannying, a bit of hotel work and a bit of random stuff! I moved rooms about another 3 times to compensate for the different numbers of people we had in and lugged myself up and down 3 flights of stairs! I did quite a lot of cooking with the girls, science experiments and arts and crafts which was fun. And also taught them chess. Not the wisest move I ever made. So painful! Talking non stop each time for about 2 hours trying to explain the game and the moves and why they couldnt do that after just telling them last time! In the end I just had to refuse to play as I couldnt handle it any longer! And I also learnt not to play snakes and ladders as they fought and cheated and cried each time they landed on a snake. The games idea by then was pretty much reduced to letting them win in Guess Who to keep the peace!! Their absolute favourite we did I reckon was making goo with cornflour and water which they played with for hours! Not so much fun was the mess seeing as we had to do it inside, but not much you can do about that!! It was then time for Sean the barman to head off as he wasnt really doing anything..... and then we were just 2!

The winter started to melt into Spring quite early and we stopped skiing about mid February as the Snow just kept getting icier and icier and slipperier and slipperier and with massive chunks of ice interspersed from the grader it was a mix of whoa!! And sliding out of control on the ice, hitting a patch of rocks of ice, bouncing your way over them and then hitting a random patch of snow stopping your skis dead in your tracks whilst the rest of your body continued its propulsion! As a result after taking the girls out and having them constantly fall over and then refuse to get themselves up and ski and then me also having endless stacks trying to watch them we decided to hang up the poles! I felt like I had tempted fate one too many times too, fully expecting some kind of awful injury with the conditions out there, but had survived unscathed. Yup, definitely time to quit whilst I was ahead!!!!

But then winter re-arrived! The temperatures dropped again, the snow came in more than we had for most of the season!!! And it was the last week! It was a massive school group from the International School in Krakow, Poland. 45 Kids and wow could they make some noise! Again we were kept up all hours of the night as they tried to keep quiet and then at the crack of dawn again! My favourite night was when they decided to play tag up and down the hallway...amazing!!!!

The first night Welshy cooked them Spaghetti Bolognaise for dinner, but as they drove here and arrived several hours later than expected they were just tired by the time they got here and didnt really eat anything. As a result, I also will add Spaghetti Bolognaise to the list of things I never want to see again as long as I live! Although I refused to eat it any longer after day 2, the rest of the family ploughed on for days! And then bananas, they were given them for lunch one day, but clearly not banana kids! And so our fruit intake was several bananas a day to make use of them all!

And then it was more leftovers, not an uncommon site to walk into the kitchen and see Welshy or Tugg eating day old hot chips out of an old ice cream container!

Again it was a massive, massive week with 3 meals a day, non stop dishes, after dinner activities and people everywhere all the time, and on top of the about 14 other weeks we had already spent working the season, we were shattered!

On the last day as soon as we waved them goodbye we finished the dishes, ran around like crazy people stripping all the rooms and then collapsing!

The next day we could sleep in!!! Woohoo!!! And then pack. Boohoo for that one!! You think that after 3 years I would be good at this, but nope and I still hate it as much as ever! I was just talking to my good friend Monty about this very fact and how good my sister Bern is at helping/motivating/coercing for this! So she came up with a plan... every third thing you touch you have to chuck away. And the lights have to be off so I cant spend hours deliberating over the items. So here goes.... if I end up in Ireland with 7 pairs of socks, one left shoe and no thermals I will be coming after you though Monty!! :-)



And then Welshy, Tugg, Michelle India, Madeleine and I all sat down to a celebratory lunch to finish the winter season. And then it was time! We loaded the car and drove into Klagenfurt to drop Welshy and I off at the airport. Although Welshy and I were ready to leave, it was still sad to say Goodbye after so long! And so we said farewell to the beautiful Austrian Alps and boarded the flight to London to embark on our next Adventures.



Things I wont miss about Austria:

News headlines on repeat, all day...every day! On the cable channel we get.

In line with number 1, listening to non stop breaking news about John Terry, English football captain who had an affair with another players wife...who cares! And Tiger Woods crashing into a tree, and the aftermath. No thankyou!

Same food menu again and again and again. Sunday, Gulash soup and schnitzel. Monday. Maryland Chicken. Tuesday. Ribs. Wednesday. Pasta. Thursday. Stew and Mash. Friday. Risotto. Saturday. Roast Pork. Arrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I never want to see any of those foods ever, ever again.

Being 6km up a mountain with no way off!

Constantly having to passive smoke and have all your things smell of cigarettes as the Austrians are addicted to smoking. Everywhere.

Semmel  the white bread buns that are practically the only bread available. That or rock hard sawdust brown rye.

Working up to 14 hour days

Being cold!! And having the hot water break down!!!







Things I will miss about Austria:

Bring 6km up a mountain in the gorgeous Alps and away from the world

Skiing out of the hotel onto the piste!

Looking out the window in the morning to fresh snow

Having a home where I dont have to move every other day!

Chatting with the friendly guests who come through

Cooking in a real kitchen with the girls and seeing their amazement at our science experiments and arts and craft activities

Internet!

The Healthcare system

The log fire :-)

Singing in the kitchen, especially the you tube song about Osama Bin Laden!

I had heard through the grapevine that some photos of my trips were gracing some Topdeck brochures so thought I would check out the web and found these (you might have to cut and paste to make them work!):

The luck of the Irish. St Patrick&apos;s Day, Dublin. Ireland

2010-03-15 to 2010-03-18

After arriving in London at about 11pm, Jo and Trev who I had met in Egypt last year had very kindly offered to put me up at the last minute after my other plans had fallen through. I arrived at their house in Shepherds Bush Market and had a fantastic 2 nights with them there before leaving at the crack of dawn on Monday morning to head to Kilburn station and catch the bus to Ireland for St Patricks Day!

I was super excited to be heading off as I sat on the tube and watched another girl with a backpack jump into my carriage. We smiled at each other and yup, turns out we were headed to the same place! Benita, an Aussie girl who had been working in Edinburgh and I became instantly inseparable for the next few days. It was fantastic!

We arrived at Kilburn station about 0615 and jumped aboard our Paddy Wagon (www.paddywagontours.com ) coach to take us to Ireland. It was to be a long day, with our ETA in Dublin about half past 5 that evening. And it was popular! Our bus was totally chockers, every seat taken, and there were also 2 other full coaches there as well. 250 people all up touring with Paddy Wagon for the celebrations!

Chatting away we stopped off in Birmingham and then all did introductions before arriving in Holyhead, Wales to catch our ferry across to Dublin. Benita and I met a few other Aussie girls here  Jaz, Suse and Siobhan who we were also to spend the next few days with. Gabriel our Irish bus driver/guide taught us all kinds of silly Irish songs that we all enjoyed singing along to, and would also in fact be able to sing along when we heard them played in pubs around the city over the next few days which was definitely pretty cool!

Trying not to look out of the window in order to avoid seasickness we arrived intact and drove the last 10 mins to our hostel in the city centre...except it took about half an hour with all the other billion holidaymakers also attempting to do the same! Paddys Palace, the Paddy Wagon hostel was a great location...... but....! We were jammed in 12 to a room with no space at all, so that I slept with feet resting on my backpack on top of my bed! There was also only 2 toilets and 2 showers for our level which had at least 3 rooms on it, intermittent lukewarm water, or no water at all for one day, and the worlds creakiest door that ensured with a room of 12 different people coming and going at different times all through the night that you got no sleep at all! ....All part of the experience though I guess! :-)

Changing clothes we headed out to our welcome party at the L.............. which was a great night as we met heaps of travellers and I also met up withTimmy, my Topdeck Tour Leader friend there with the Topdeck trip that was randomly staying right next door to us, and having their welcome party right across the street!

The next morning we had our complimentary continental buffet breakfast...bread and jam! And jumped on the bus for an hour and a half trip out west towards the Wicklow Mountains and Glendalough (said Glen-da-lock). It was a really pretty area and we spent some time wandering around the lake, up to the waterfall, around the old church ruins and finding the cross of St Georges church where local legend has it that if you can link your fingers around it you will be married within 12 months. Luckily I escaped as there was no way that my arms would even meet!! :-) The area was gorgeous, but really quite browner that I was expecting, and also bitterly cold! We were quite glad when we could jump back onto the warm bus again and have a nap on the way back into town for lunch!

Dublin city looked great and everyone was getting into the spirit, all dressed up as leprechauns, shamrocks, and with all sorts of green things around. Next stop was the Guinness brewery, which, as a non Guinness and non beer drinker didnt excite me...but it actually turned out to be really cool! There were hundreds of people there, but there was more than enough space for everyone with about 5 different levels of different information or interactive displays. My least favourite was the Guinness tastings area where an employee guided you through the best way to taste the flavours of Guinness, like when you taste wine. The last part when you swished it around your mouth like mouthwash was disgusting! Almost enough to make you want to vomit! Needless to say, the rest of my Guinness was left sat undrunk!

There were really cool exhibitions though with all the Guinness advertising through history, including in 1954 when 50 000 Guinness bottles were dropped into the sea, and then 150 000 again in 1959 to celebrate the bicentenary of the company. And the coolest thing is that they are still being discovered mainly off the coast of the USA and Canada today!!

There were advertisements on why Guinness is good for you, how it builds strong muscles, cures insomnia, was prescribed to pregnant women, how it cured ailments and all sort of other randomly hilarious things!

We also learnt details of how the original 9000 year lease was signed on the factory and saw a scale model of the place, showing just how massive it really was. There were also Guinness ships just for the purpose of shipping Guinness around the world, and even all the way back in 1800, Guinness managed to ship its products to troops serving all around the world! Pretty impressive logistics considering the times!!



On successful completion of the factory tour you are entitled to a pint of Guinness at one of the bars at the top, or the rooftop bar on the very top level, which we unfortunately never made it to! A whole pint of Guinness....Benita and I decided we would try and drink it all as we met up with my friend Timmy in one of the bars. And yes, no less gross than earlier! Apparently, our driver Gabriel was telling us that it is all in the motion of the wrist to enjoy Guinness  you need to keep your elbow straight by your side, and then just use your wrist to tip the glass so when you drink it you just get the beer underneath and not the layer of froth on the top. It actually made it bearable, as that froth is disgusting! But unfortunately I was still not to finish it!

Back into town Benita and I shopped around for some green to wear for St Patricks day and then wandered around the town. We met up with Timmy at ISAACS, his hostel next door...which was absolutely amazing  a world apart from ours!! And had a few drinks before we walked down the road for dinner. Most places had a wait and so we ended up at L.................... where we were the night before.... but the food was absolutely delicious!



We had painted our fingernails bright green, applied shamrock tattoos to our cheeks, added green eyeshadow, glitter, our green paddywagon t-shirts, shamrock headbands and Irish feather boas and we were ready to paint the town green!

The entire paddy wagon tour met outside the hostel just after 10 so we could all have a group photo. And it looked fantastic!!! I am trying to get a copy of the photo, with several hundred people all dressed up in green ready to celebrate the Irish National Day!!

Walking down to the bridge we braced ourselves against all the shoving people to keep our spot for the parade. And geez it was difficult as people arrived later, attempted to push their way to the front, push their kids to the front, sneak in a few friends who werent there earlier or pretend to be sick and need to hold on so they could have prime viewing positions! At least it was warm with all the other people around blocking the wind though!!

We stood there for 2 hours waiting!!! Crazy!! But between the 5 of us we entertained ourselves looking at some of the awesome costumes in the crowd and some of the places people were perched to watch the parade, on top of lightposts and everywhere you can think of! It did look absolutely awesome though everywhere you looked there was green!

We saw a whole heap of green balloons floating through the sky and that apparently marked the start of the parade. Dozens of girls then appeared running in heels for the Stiletto dash to raise money for breast cancer before a random buy dressed as a pope, and then another random guy dressed in a suit came down the road waving from a car.

And then the parade arrived! There were bands, the army, a DJ on a giant turtle, heaps of different costumes and dancers, acrobats, giant animals, chefs chasing chickens, kids dressed as housewives, people of stilts, and my favourite a North Carolina College band and baton twirlers which were amazing!! I also loved the fact that all the floats were either bicycle powered or foot powered! It was great! There was also a whole heap of cyclists that came through at the end...promoting something I am sure, but one lady tried to do a circle to turn around but instead crashed in front of everyone and lost everything from her basket  clothes, lunch, paperwork! She must have felt awful!

And then we could not move! After the parade there was just such a giant crush of people trying to move it was impossible! Slowly, but surely we made our way down the crowded streets into Temple Bar, the bar/pub/club district and found an awesome place with enough space to breathe and with a live singer/guitar player that was amazing! He was so good we just stayed there all afternoon joining in the crowd singing along to all his songs. Brilliant!

It was time to head back over the other side of the Illifye ..........River to the Arlington Hotel where our PaddyWagon After Party was to be. We pubcrawled back, meeting all sorts of random Irish and non Irish alike and seeing all sorts of different pubs before we headed inside. There was live music, some really cool Irish dancing and then a DJ on all night. It was a fantastic night to follow an equally fantastic day!

The next morning was not quite as fantastic though as we had to get up at 6 something to be packed and on the bus ready to depart at 7am! I was still covered in glitter, but had managed to scrub off my shamrock tattoos from my face which was more than most of the rest of the bus though which was quite hilarious! The bus ride to the ferry was deathly quiet and once on the ferry it was just a massive sea of bodies everywhere as people crashed out on the couches, chairs, tables, floor  anywhere they could! And it was sooooo rough too! Just plain nasty really! Benita was staying in London, but I luckily ended up with a kiwi guy called Roy next to me which was awesome to chat to someone to pass the time as we sat on the bus for hours and hours and hours before we finally arrived into Kilburn station about 7pm, an hour late and after a good nasty 12 hours cooped up travelling! Nasty!!!! But still more to come as I attempted to make my way to Hastings!



The verdict though  St Patricks Day in Ireland being part of the awesome atmosphere and brilliant activities...... Amazing!!!!
 
Crappy English Weather! Couchsurfing in Hastings, East Sussex, England

2010-03-18 to 2010-03-20

Arriving in Londons Kilburn station almost an hour late and after almost 12 hours on the bus, we grabbed our luggage and joined the crowds of Londoners on the tube... in peak hour  good planning! Swapping trains to the Victoria line, I ran down the platform and squashed people out the way to get on...as it sat there! Delays on the line meant we all stood there in the sweltering hot packed out train waiting, waiting, waiting... Finally we were on our way and arrived into London Victoria as I headed over to the most unhelpful information man in the world and tried to get a new train ticket out to Hastings. Luckily I located a nice friendly lady who printed me a ticket and advised run the train leaves in 6 minutes! I grabbed my bags and vainly attempted to run through the throngs of commuters, through the turnstiles, finding the right carriage to jump into and an empty space!

Ahh relax! Im sure the man next to me loved the fact that he had a sweaty backpacker slumped next to him for his journey home that night!! :-) At about 10pm that night we pulled into Hastings and I met Barnaby, the couchsurfer that I was to stay with. After over 15 hours since I had started travelling that morning I had finally arrived at my destination...and Barnaby had very kindly organised an evening out heading down to the local music and wine bar!!! I popped another berocca (multivitamin) tablet and put on my happy face! The bar was really cool though, it was full (about 15 people) of locals and a band consisting of about 5 men aged about 60 or so who just loved music and were so happy to be there performing!

We headed back to the house and I was stoked to find my own room with a double bed and doona waiting for me....with electric blanket!! Heaven!! So excited to sleep!! But not so excited to find out the hard way that the toilet cistern took hours to fill up and the only way to flush it was to get a bowl from the kitchen and fill it up! The floor was carpet though so at least your feet didnt get cold on the journey back and forth to the tap!

Apparently the seagulls were going to wake me up in the morning, but either I managed to sleep through their screeching or they forgot to come! The day dawned full of gloomy British mist, cold and rain but rugged up to the max Barny and I headed out to walk down to the old town for lunch. There was a view of absolutely nothing through the fog!, but Hastings is a really popular summer beachside resort and the largest ocean based fishing port that there is in England.

The old town was really pretty and lots of choices with little local cafes full of lovely friendly people. Walking home the rain had definitely set in and so we jumped into the car to see some of the local sites. Barny had a book called .....................  by ............. (I have to find this out!!!) which basically listed weird things that had no point, or follies. As some of these follies (about 200 years old) were close by we headed to check them out. Firstly we drove through the town of Battle where the battle of Hastings took place and then came across the tower in the middle of a muddy horse paddock that had parts of the brick interior fallen all over the rusty wobbly steps up! A random obelisk in the middle of a field, an observatory that is now a really really cool round house, and a pyramid that is where a well known eccentric local - mad jack http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_&apos;Mad_Jack&apos;_Fuller or http://johnmadjackfuller.homestead.com/ is buried in Brightling church cemetery. Local legend also has that he was laid to rest on a metal table with a full meal in front of him, a bottle of claret at arms length and broken glass covering the floor to stop the devil. Unfortunately this was proven to be false when the grave was opened to replace the rotting door, but sounds cool still nonetheless! Our last folly to find was the Sugar Loaf - spire which was built by mad jack in order to win a bet!

Due to the weather, the ground was ridiculously wet and muddy and so we were saturated, dirty and covered in horse slobber from walking through their paddocks by the time we left!



Next up was Bodiam Castle, which was amazing!! It is a perfect castle  in that it is still fully intact and unbelievably beautiful as we walked around its moat and gardens and appreciated it. The moat near the entrance was also full of massive golden and brown cod waiting for a feed!

Everywhere around the area are also what are known locally as Oast houses. These are old working mills where hops used to be dried and have now been converted into these super cute houses!

Our final stop was the Smallest house in Sussex! Ridiculous! You will have to see the photo to fully appreciate it, but it is just a one roomed home of just a few metres!

We quickly hit the supermarket, I cooked dinner and we then walked back through the rain to the old town to the movie theatre. It is a narrow doorway on a little road where you walk up some stairs and are greeted by a lady-man dressed in a traditional old Ushers outfit taking our names and passing us through inside the door. There was a little shop in the back of the theatre where you could buy snacks and wines and then head the approx 2 metres to your seats! The theatre seated about 50 and it was a beautiful old fashioned design, just a small room and rows of four seats on either side covered in red velvet.

The movie, The Time Travellers Wife was great, but it was the atmosphere of the place that was really cool! We were definitely glad to get home and out of the rain though!



The next morning dawned another typical English day and so began the process of rugging up again to walk through the new town and along the promenade on the East Sussex seafront through Hastings and St Leonard. It was grey as doom, bitterly cold and windy, but at least the rain was staying away! The whole area is quite well known as it is where William the Conqueror landed in 1066, and not sure how this is proven, but there is also a giant slab of rock with a plaque indicating the position where William rested and ate during his landing!

Barnaby was keen to have a cup of coffee or tea every few hours so our days were punctuated by how we were to break the time up to fit all of these in! We met Barnys friend Suze for one of these breaks before we headed into the old town of Hastings to Boulevard Books. It was probably my favourite place I have been in ages! It is a second hand bookstore run by Graham and his Thai wife June that has a tiny kitchen in the back, and tables all through the rooms of the store. Every lunch and dinner time June cooks up a delicious Thai feast and you can just sit there in this amazing old bookstore atmosphere and dine! It is a 2 course meal and the food was absolutely delicious! I cannot rave about it enough it was that awesome, and just wandering around and chatting to Graham and June was awesome. It looks like quite a small store, but there are tables jammed in every area possible and I think they said they have had up to about 30 people dining!

Walking back up the hill, I headed off to the Smugglers Caves, Saint Clements (http://www.smugglersadventure.co.uk/smugglers/smugglers.shtml )which are this awesome set of surprisingly enough...caves! It was used during the war to escape the taxes of buying things off the street, but then closed off. They were then rediscovered years later when a farm worker almost feel through the ground into them! He then spent many years doing up the caves and they were then used for dances in a ballroom, and then in the second world war as a hospital and bunker to protect the locals. Later on it was then turned into a museum which is really interesting....And there are still ghosts there though and lots of funny things going on, especially at night!

I then walked through the old town and as the rain was again about to set in, headed back up the hill to Barnys house. Another of Barnys friends, Jo came over for dinner and I again cooked and it was time to rock and roll! Onto the train at Hastings to head to Gatwick Airport for the night!
 
One night in Gatwick Airport, England

2010-03-21

Originally I had a convenient flight booked out of London at a reasonable hour of midday, where I could catch a train straight to the airport, land in Amsterdam and catch a train to the crew house in Wembledinge. But no, that was far too easy! British Airways decided that strike action should go ahead on that day and subsequently cancelled my flight. As I was in Ireland when I got the message, there was nothing I could do until I arrived at my couchsurfing hosts house in Hastings and jump on the net to try and sort it out!

There were 2 chartered British Airways flights that day with seats available that I could transfer to- one at the crack of dawn, the other late at night when I would be unable to complete the journey back to the crew house due to public transport having finished.

Undeterred I checked the bus  15 hours no thank you!!!!, the train  200 euro!!!! The bus/train/ferry links, 15 hours and almost 100 euros!! And all other flight carriers  starting at 150 euro!!!! The only option was the British Airways crack of dawn flight which meant that I could not get a connecting train to get me there in time from where I currently was in Hastings, about 1 ½ hours away from Gatwick airport on the train.

Then I remembered a website I had been told about  www.sleepinginairports.net - and duly checked up on Gatwick. Turns out it is a great airport to stay in! There are 24 hour security, comfy couches without airrests you can stretch out on, no announcements, no crazy aircon, showers, toilets, snack machines, 24 hour internet cafes! Woohoo! Luxury!

And so it was settled. The website indicated that I should turn up early for a good position and so luckily booked a ridiculously cheap train fare up to the airport to get me there in plenty of time to grab a prime spot. Arriving at the airport at about 11pm I headed up to the arrivals area as indicated on the website and found it exactly as it was described! The first lot of seats were all taken, but I then located an even better quieter set further down the back and set my sleeping bag up.

I was joined by dozens of other weary travellers through the night as I woke up the next morning refreshed and ready to check in for my flight! What a great idea! And what a great website! Definitely would totally recommend trying it if you have an inconvenient flight, or refuse to pay a zillion dollars for close by accommodation.

In fact it turned out to be a fantastic nights sleep and even better than the one I had the next night sleeping at the freezing cold crew house!



A little hesitant after listening to various conversations around, my British Airways flight did leave as expected, even with the strike and had a great flight. Arriving in Amsterdam I was given the Spanish inquisition by customs, but then looking in the mirror later realised it was probably because I was wearing my work jumper that has Topdeck crew written across the front! Oops!

A helpful station assistant gave me my train timings and I jumped onboard. About 3 hours later I was in Goes, our nearest big town, but no public buses for another 2 hours as it was a Sunday. One of the drivers at the crew house , Pauly very kindly came in and picked me up and I was home again! It definitely felt like Home Sweet Home and it was great to be back, see everyone who was there and enjoy the home cooked food Boobs had so kindly made for everyone who had travelled back. So nice! And also to see our super grumpy house cat ( who really belongs to the next door neighbour) Ginger Ninja SO fat after the winter!!
 
Montage - Setting up the permanent Topdeck cooktents around Europe

2010-03-22 to 2010-04-05

After most of the house had had a big night on their arrival back from a visit to the new catering contractors in Paris, it was a very slow morning! We arranged to meet at midday ready to begin what we call Montage.

Montage is the setting up of our permanent cooktent structures in our campsites in Europe  Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland and Venice and Rome, Italy after they were taken down and stored for the winter after the end of the season last year. Our team consisted of 6 people  the catering manager Rivett, the equipment manager Warwick, and Sutho, Boobs, Welshy and I.

Laughing at half of our crew, we headed over to the equipment shed to pack our van, Merv , our two site cars, pick up our stuff at the house...and we were off! Half past 1! :-) Could have been worse! We had a massive drive ahead of us  9-10 hours as we begin our journey through the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and into Switzerland. It was a long haul, stopping off at servos and finally arriving at our campsite in Lauterbrunnen at about half past 11, only losing the car with Welshy and Rivett twice along the way!

We had been given a dorm upstairs so headed straight up and all totally crashed out, not hearing a thing until our alarms went off the next morning. Where we were to establish the cooktent had been cleared of snow, but the ground was still too uneven to be able to lay the flooring on. We chatted with Debs in the office to coord a grader coming in later in the week and she made us all tea/coffee filled with schnapps. Disgusting!! One by one we all excused ourselves and headed outside to tip it in the garden!



Half past 10 we hit the road again on the way to our next site in Venice. Leaving the Swiss Alps we hit a massive traffic jam and stopped dead near the Goddard tunnel. Joining the other motorists on the side of the road and steeling ourselves ready to sit there for the next few hours we were pleasantly surprised when the cars started moving in about 15 mins! We went through the worlds second longest land tunnel which felt like it took forever before heading into the land of crazy Italian drivers and spending the next few hours either sitting in more traffic jams or dodging and swerving at high speeds to try and avoid being crashed into! We were well over sitting in cars as we pulled into the campsite about half past 7, 9 hours after we had started driving, to find the place deserted! Finding a maintenance man we were directed to our accommodation which was still dirty from last season, no hot water, others with no running water, beds on top of each other and no bedding! After several phone calls it turned out we were in PIN 27-32, not TWIN 27-32! :-)

After a tasty foodcourt dinner we again all totally crashed ready for our first day of setting up! The site for the tent in Venice had been filled with campsite outdoor furniture over the winter and so webegan moving this out. We then realised that the flooring had sunk in places and had to head into the local shopping centre to buy some sand to even up underneath so we could relay the cement blocks.

We definitely looked a treat, walking into the shopping centre dressed in a variation of old clothes - trackpants, 3/4 length trackpants/ torn old jeans, gumboots and covered in dirt! The Italians all dress very well and we certainly got our fair share of looks!!

It was even funnier trying to find sand at the hardware store. After unsuccessfully looking, we attempted to ask but no one spoke English. I then tried in Spanish which worked quite well... until I realised I didnt know the word for sand! so had to go about a massive story in broken Spanish about what we were trying to do and the beach for where it came from to try and get them to understand! And somehow...luckily!... it worked! A super helpful employee figuring it out and kindly guiding us to the right spot. Success!!

We then high pressure hosed the floor, built the frame of the marquee (only one roof pole swapped for the side!), put up the walls and ceiling, which was quite comical as I think ever single mistake in the book was made by the boys trying to explain how to do it correctly! But in no time at all the tent was up, we had cleaned the fridges and shelves of mould and placed them into the tent. The hot water and stove took a while to sort out, but all well in the end. After a successful day and some celebratory red wine that evening, no one but myself and Warwick managed to get out of bed in the morning! Quite funny later too as we found out that most of them had managed to somehow get really dodgy old mattresses which had no foam and just springs in their backs all nights!!! Even funnier as one by one everyone came staggering in, groaning at the things we had to do which somehow took 10 times as long! It was hilarious though as we finished all we could and had a delicious chicken, lemon, rosemary and garlic feast cooked by Rivett. Mmm mm!



Off to Roma the next morning again convoying through the crazy Italian drivers to luckily arrive again unscathed in one piece again! We only took 2 vehicles down, and one work car has only 2 seatbelts for at least 4 people which I think is seriously dodge on the roads we required to drive on, but I refused to ride without one - travelling up to 150km along a highway surrounded by crazy Italian drivers. It is ridiculous not to. There were others unfazed though so there was plenty of room. It was so funny as we drove though  on some of the toll roads you need to get a ticket as you enter and then pay for basically the amount of kms you travelled along as you leave. As the first car pulled up to the ticket booth the ticket came out, got snapped off by the wind and flew down the road as we sat there laughing watching poor Sutho jump out and try and retrieve it. We laughed even harder when about 10 seconds later the exact same thing happened to us!!!

We quickly began work setting up the frame of the structure. Using a rope and pulley system we managed to pull the roof sections over and then attach all the walls. It was already evening by this stage and a few other Topdeck friends on another trip  Letty and Dan  came out to join us for dinner. It was the culmination of the campaigning for the regional elections and the right wing end of campaign celebration was being held at the campsite restaurant and bar. Literally a thousand people were expected as the campsite filled out with supporters and heaps of police to keep an eye on things. The banners and signs all went up and we were invited to join in the celebrations by the restaurant manager, Giuseppe. A usual Italian dinner time of after 9pm ensured a delicious pizza and pasta for us in a lovely welcome back to Italian food!

The next day it was daylight savings...but conveniently none of us realised and so all got an extra hour of laying in!

And it was Eat like K day for Welshy! Welshy and I had spent the winter working together in Austria and he always laughed at me as I ate properly, went to the gym, refused chips or took the fatty skin off my chicken. And so today he was living like me! Starting the day with fruit and yoghurt for breakfast Welshy looked so disheartened as everyone around us sat tucking into their fried eggs, bacon and white rolls. Snacking on fruit as he watched the others tuck into cheese and salami and eating a salad roll with multigrain bread for lunch poor Welshy looked distraught! And then it was over! After trying so hard all day it was time to crack and go back to his regular eating! Funny whilst it lasted though!



It was another 2 tough workdays though as we scrubbed the kitchen floor with brooms and bleach to remove all the grease, and then all the tent sides and dining hall area to remove the mould (not fun!!) before power hosing the entire area and then spending countless hours trying to squeegee it out from the ridiculously useless drainage system installed  one drain in one corner on an uphill rise! Ridiculous! Oh yes, with power cords running through the middle too  OH&amp;S;?? Whats that?!

We had another delicious Italian meal in the campsite restaurant and were all so shattered we were almost falling asleep at the dinner table! Sticking up on the vitamin C as we all also started to come down with a cold, we moved all the appliances again, cleaned all the appliances and equipment, power hosed the electric fans.... which still miraculously worked afterwards! Did all the electricity, at times having a ladder sitting on top of a pile of folded tables and who knows what else in order to reach and then started putting it all back together and all the tables and chairs out in the dining area....and complete! Rome site done :-)

Although shattered we all decided we had had enough of campsites and headed into Rome for dinner at a fabulous restaurant near the Trevi fountain called the Spaghetteria where I had eaten several times before.

As we arrived, there was a massive queue outside and as we negotiated our options the maître d came up to us  6 we said despondently, as much to our amazement he replied no worries, I have a table for 6 downstairs  just go straight through!!! amazing! The place was totally packed out and we enjoyed checking out the menu with 130 different types of pasta sauce! It is an actual book! It took ages to get served, but then the entrees came out immediately...followed in quick succession by our mains several bites later! It was delicious authentic food though so we enjoyed eating it in Italy and not being in a cooktent or campsite! Grabbing a taxi home he ran up 2 gutters as he tried to turn, but we somehow made it home unscathed. Ahh Italy! :-)

Packing up we were on the road again! Back to Venice to finish off a few little things and also have a break with the driving as it was such a long distance back to Lauterbrunnen. Trying to navigate around the crazy Italian drivers in a three car convoy, we could see in the distance the other two cars dodging a semi-trailer to make an exit, but there was no way we could and so we headed in the opposite direction as I waved out the window to the others, Sutho waving back and Rivet looking shocked! After a few circles and round abouts we finally made it back onto the highway and met up with the others at the next service stop where they were waiting for us. Made it in the end!! Sitting around the cooktent that night chatting we also checked out the progress of the campsite to be ready to open again in a week and jumped down inside the empty pool to find frogs! There were at least 4 varying sizes of brown spotty frogs in the bottom. Lov-er-ly!!

Another long drive day, but this time back to our final side to set up...but also the hardest! It felt like the drive took forever as we drove through possibly a MILLION tunnels, up the windy roads through the Alps and then finally arrived in the valley, got our dorm and then headed up to the Hotel oberland on the main street which has a restaurant selling traditional Swiss dishes, but it is owned?run? not sure which! By an Australian couple. The main thing on the menu is rosti- which is a grated potato dish which is then fried or baked in the oven and then comes with your choice of tastiness  onion and garlic and cream and cheese or eggs or meat or anything that you wish! There is also the famous swiss fondue which arrives in a massive fondue pot and a MASSIVE basket of bread, mushrooms, garlic, onions, herbs, and everything you can think of to add/dip!

Lauterbrunnen is literally a one street town  there is just one road winding through the valley with shops/houses/restaurants/a church/ campsites or guesthouses on it. So cute!

And then the fun began. The various parts of the cooktent and structure where spread between several sheds in various corners of the campsite and so we borrowed the WW2 campsite jeep to hook to a trailer and start moving the stuff. But unfortunately it didnt want to start! After running up and down the small gradient trying to push start it, doing laps and then jump starting it the camp handyman heard us and took it over to get charged. And so we began to carry all the parts over by hand, the massive marquee beams falling out of our arms as we navigated through the mud, past the sheep and through the hedge to the site! And then a saviour arrived with a 4wd to bring a load of things across for us which was really nice.

And so we began to try and piece together the giant jigsaw puzzle that was the frame. Warwick decided to lay all the pieces out on the ground whilst we were bring the rest over, but laid them out entirely backwards. We all assumed he knew what he was doing. Wrong! As a result we all sat there for literally probably an hour scratching our heads trying to figure out how to put them together, before it suddenly hit Welshy that we had to turn them all at a 90 angle! Ridiculous! It is a crazy, crazy structure to try and set up with loads of different pieces fitting into different places and different number of different parts that are kind of similar but different weights or the like. Not fun at all! Finally we got the base together, bolted it all into place and the boys spent a while chocking it up with bits of wood to make it level before we got the trailer, loaded it up with the wooden floorboard and slid them all into place. Also...not fun! If one side moves any faster down the rails than the other it all gets stuck, you have to pull it out and start again!! We developed a highly skilled way of checking the levelness of our work - rolling a milk bottle as it was the only round thing that we could find! We then unanimously decided that although it rolled, as the roll did not increase its speed it was even enough for us!

By this stage it was about 6pm and we were shattered after our constant workload over the past week and a half, massive drive days and then a full on day lighting heavy things and so started to get freezing freezing cold, delirious, laughing, dropping all kinds of things, getting our limbs caught as we were moving, but luckily no serious damage!

The next morning we awoke to snow!! The valley was covered and so spent some quality time catching up on emails and heading out to the New-Yorker, this awesome store with nice clothes really cheap to get some new clothes to trash for the season! By lunchtime the snow had stopped and so we began bringing over all the next things we needed, loading up the trailer like gypsies and riding around the campsite on it. We lifted lots more heavy bars, bolted them in pace to make the frame and somehow managed to make it stay up...albeit with a slight (massive!) slant to the left. We then threw the ropes over the top and pulled and pulled and pulled the roof sections over. Progress!!

It was starting to get SO cold and SO dark and we were all freezing as one of our camping trips arrived, we helped them set up their stuff and helped them cook dinner in the unbelievably Arctic conditions! It was so nasty! Our fingers and toes were all frozen and painful so we were glad when we finally managed to make it up to our beds!

We all almost snapped our fingers trying to make them work in the cold and do lots of fiddly little tasks like threading the walls of the tent through their slot in the metal sides, stretching the sides to zipper closed or pulling them to make then even. Nasty when cold! We got the main part of the tent up and them attempted to carry all sorts of ridiculously heavy industrial kitchen equipment from the sheds, up onto the trailer and into the cooktent.

We needed new lino to cover the floor of the kitchen and so finally managed to track some down, lay it, stick it down with gaffa tape and then were able to move all the equipment into their rightful homes, clean them and set them up!

Our first trip that we were supposed to be cooking for arrived, but we had managed to arrange the campsite to do their dinners. We still had to make their lunches. As it was Easter all the shops were also closed and so Rivet had to fill up the back of the car for all the groups coming in the next week on the Thursday! Luckily it is so cold in Lauterbrunnen that there is currently no requirement for a fridge  we could just leave everything in the back of the cars!

Unfortunately the owner is extremely moody and we did not catch her in a good mood! Therefore we were not allowed to use the campsite industrial kitchen to cook the groups lunch. We then spent about an hour and a half boiling water on mini elements in the mini communal kitchen to no avail, and were finally allowed into the proper kitchen about half past 9 to start to prepare the pasta for their packed lunches, finishing about 11pm. Nothing like another long day on the road after being up at 7am to help and see the other group off!

Some more Topdeck friends, Tim and Seb were here with the next group so we chilled out with them in the evening whilst the rest of our Montage team left to drive for 5 hours to a service station on the highway in France to drop off Sutho at midnight for the montage team to turn around, drive 5 hours back to Lauterbrunnen and Sutho to drive the ski trip coach back to the depot after there was a screw up with not having enough drivers to do it....even though there were spare drivers sitting around at the depot. Good to love management planning!!!!!!!!!!! Again...ridiculous!

Easter Sunday! We got up early to put the lunch out for the group and found it pouring with rain. Once done, the bells of the cute little local church were tolling as I walked up to the Easter Service, just cause I was there and I could! It was a Presbetyrian church, and all in Swiss German but it was so cute as the bells finished their 15 min toll ready for the minister to begin. There was a massive organ and several flutists which was really cool and happy and chilled out...and warm! And then the rain stopped...time to work! Our roof putting on had not been quite to standard and so there were massive massive pools of water sitting in sections of the roof we had to push out and that then flooded into the tent. Oops!

We then worked like champions sweeping and mopping, cleaning all the tables and chairs, finishing the kitchen and all the little left over chores and we were done!! Woohoo!! Montage complete!!

We headed up the road to the Steinboch hotel and sat discussing the catering plan for the year, and then dinner time! I have never seen such a grumpy waitress!! And that is saying something! She clearly did not want to be there or want us to be there and we almost died of hunger before the food came, but it was a nice way to finish the trip. We had a few drinks at the Horner Bar with all the crew and then time to head home ready to hit the road in the morning!

We had a late start but were on the road thanks to route notes from Boobs and Suthos map in case of emergency. And all started out quite well...we had five countries to cover and about 10 hours of driving! ...until we hit the Easter holiday traffic! Ugh! It wasnt too bad, although we did definitely lose some time there! For the first time it has happened to me, we were stopped at the Swiss Border for the van to be searched and questions asked which was all really really weird  he even looked through the Topdeck brochures in the back! But were let go with no worries. We had a great dinner in Luxembourg  see the next blog!  and then unfortunately missed the right highway! Instead of being on the A road, we were on the E road which did not link up with our next required highway! I spent the next few hours navigating us very closely from the map and finally got us re-linked up and back on track!! The darkness had settled in and we realised that one of our headlights was down. Now, this had been down the entire time we had been away, but my co-driver Warrick decided that it was the perfect opportunity to fix it and so pulled up on the side of the road at the next services to try and fix it! After buying a new bulb, trying different fuses and me standing in the freezing, freezing cold and darkness for over an hour, he decided it couldnt be done and we were back on the road again!!! Another stop to refill the oil a few hours later and I was definitely ready to be home!! And then we hit the Antwerp ring road. Talk about confusing!! The highway just merges into a ring road 1 or 2 and with no other signs! After 2 laps we got it sorted and got the exit we thought we were after and asked the Toll chick...yup, finally on track!! Woohoo!! And so just before 2am, about 14 hours after we had left we finally made it back to the crew house in Wemledinge, Holland. Shattered!!! And then I accidently chose the room with the loudest snorer in the world!!! Husky. Called for a reason! Definitely not a lot of sleep that night! I did move rooms though first thing the next morning :-)



Things we discover 

France  has no toilet seats  nope, none at all...just the toilet bowl

Italians  the worst drivers! But great services called autogrills

- In order to get the water to run in the sinks in toilets etc you have to press a foot pedal underneath it. It is quite funny to sit back and watch how challenging it is for some to find it!

Venice campsite  listening to airplanes land at the airport right over the back fence! :-)

Lauterbrunnen  living in the gorgeous valley and listening to the church bells toll throughout all during the day

Germany  has toilet seats that rotate when you flush to clean them!
 
Luxembourg and the question i cannot answer - why does the Red Cross flag fly over the city??

2010-04-05 to 2010-04-06

We pulled off the highway onto the Luxembourg exit. The whole reason we were heading there was a country race I was having with another of the Topdeck crew  Rob. We had driven through the country several times, but unless you are on the country soil you cannot count it! As a result as it was at a good time in our journey we were going to stop I n for dinner and I could claim country number 49 to equal the race with Rob!

The capital of Luxembourg is Luxembourg, so it is quite easy to remember! It was really easy to get in which was a pleasant surprise and almost immediately we were confronted with gorgeous old buildings, churches and a MASSIVE gorge that split the city in half. I am not sure exactly how deep and wide it is, but it is massive! There are HUGE bridges and aqueducts across it, and there are steps and paths and gorgeous walks and running paths all the way down through it. It was simply stunning!

Across the other side of the river we ended up doing another lap of the city and then also super quickly we found a park big enough for the work vehicle we were driving! Just too easy! We were a street away from the main pedestrian part of the city and the quaint little old buildings were beautiful! We walked over to the gorge and I was even more amazed as I looked down into it and up and down as far as the eye can see. And that is where the question I cannot solve has been puzzling me. The flag of Luxembourg is a three colour horizontal stripe (red, white and blue I think!), but over the gorge there was a MASSIVE red cross flag flying and all through the city there were many more of them. Why? Why is this so??! I have even googled this and even google cannot provide me with the answer!!

We continued our exploring and came across markets in a square and people everywhere outside enjoying the beautiful evening. ! It was such a nice atmosphere as we walked round the windy little roads until we came across the main square where a band was playing in the gazebo in the centre and everyone was enjoying listening to them. It was the British Youth Ambassadors band and they were fantastic! We walked around and then found a nice little cafe/restaurant on the edge of the main square where we could sit amongst the beautiful flowers, weather, atmosphere and listen to the live music!

And so the language of Luxembourg is French...but luckily the waiters spoke English  even if he had the urge to pull his eyes out sideways in a slanty motion when I asked for a definition of a menu item, which turned out to be a Chinese stirfry. I couldnt believe it! Just in case I didnt understand the words Chinese or Stirfry!

The little restaurant, lacademie was absolutely delicious, but all too soon it started to get cold and we needed to hit the road! As we drove out we saw an amazing sunset over the gorge. Beautiful!

The verict  Luxembourg is great! A small city, but gorgeous to stroll around and enjoy. It is apparently also a duty free haven and a good cheap place to shop at!
 
The Dinge, Calais, Dover, London, St, Ives, Cambridge, St Ives, London, Dover Calais, The Dinge!

2010-04-07 to 2010-04-14

It was great to be back at the crew house and see one of my good mates Marky Mark there. But the thought of sitting there alone in the cold cold house for the next 2 weeks was enough to send me insane and so after a nice day chillaxing, running, riding and doing the washing I was ready to move on!! Marky Mark was going home and so kindly invited e back to his mums house in St Ives, about an hour north of London. Marky jumped on the Eurostar and the next morning I caught our Topdeck bus down to the docks to catch the ferry from Calais to Dover. It was quite straightforward which was nice and I didnt even get questioned on my passport and million entry and exit stamps which was even nicer!!

The ferry was running slightly late and so as we arrived, just missed the bus to London. It was over an hour til the next one, but there were couches and wifi so nice and comfy! Arriving in London I headed to Waterloo station where I met Jaz, an aussie girl I had met in Ireland and had kindly offered me to stay! It was a great house- 3 mins from the tube, right in the heart of London and looking out onto the London Eye! It had double bunk beds, kitchen, lounge, 2 bathrooms and a pool, spa and sauna downstairs!! Best house share I have ever seen!!! Sure beats the share houses of 20 aussies in elsewhere in London!!

I had a great night catching up and then jumped on a train the next morning up to Huntingdon. It was so easy  just an hour outside of London and so beautiful! Mark and his twin brother Dan kindly picked me up from the station and took me home. We had an awesome time going for bike rides around the area and just chilling! It was so nice to be able to be somewhere and doing that after not being home for years! The area was so pretty as well  there was an old stone bridge and river from about the beginning of time, old mills, really really old thatched roof houses with tiny little doors even shorter than me! And everyone was so friendly and nice! Marks mum Annie and partner Paul were really lovely as well and I had a great time.

We headed into Cambridge one day to catch up with another Topdeck friend, Michelle, hiring bikes and riding them for 10 mins before we sat down, had lunch, chatted and then had a go punting on the River Cam. Our guide Sam let both Michelle and I have a go, Michelle doing well, just crashing into a few boats, which I avoided....but managed to hit a wall :-) Definitely harder than it looks trying to steer!!

It is a gorgeous, gorgeous city with lots of beautiful old buildings of the University, even where Prince Charles studied, where the Harry Potter Quiddich scene was filmed in the first movie and the Bridge of Sighs  a replica of the one in Venice  where the students walked over from the accommodation to the University to take their exams. We also learnt an interesting fact that the windows were so small on all the old buildings as people used to be taxed on the size of these, hence the term daylight robbery coming about as we looked at these beautiful old buildings with tiny little windows the size of A4 pieces of paper!

We sat back, enjoyed the boat ride and a bottle of wine as we jumped off realised that it was then time to return our bikes! 10 mins of riding was all we managed but it was a great day!

Another friend, Vic, was house sitting nearby and so we grabbed some supplies and attempted to find the house. We didnt do too badly...just walking up and down the street a few times to locate the place! It was a really nice old building as well on manicured grounds which were just lovely. We cooked, made use of the massage chair and spent the night chatting before passing out on the sofas. Bidding adieu the next morning, Annie and Paul kindly picked us up and took us straight out for an awesome all you can eat Indian buffet as we tidied ourselves up in the bathrooms to look presentable for entering before we rolled home to take up residence on the couch for the rest of the day!!

Another gorgeous ride through the countryside, a delicious dinner feast of my first true home cooked English meal of cottage pie it was all too soon time to hit the train and head back to London. We had booked into the Clink hostel, the new hostel that Topdeck is using this year as a departure point for its trips. It is kind of difficult to find, and there are 2 about 5 mins apart with the same name but we made it in the end! It is an old courthouse and really nice... but wow that was where the good impression ended! There were very few toilets and the ones on our level were blocked. The dorm we were in was 14 people and definitely difficult to sleep! The light from outside streamed in all night and people came and went, turning on the light, slamming and reopening the door, talking, standing in the corridors and you name it!

Luckily (?) we had to be up at 5 anyway to catch the tube to our meeting point so struggled out and onto the bus to snooze the entire way back to Dover! And then back on the ferry! And then back to waiting! :-) We caught the Topdeck bus to the passenger terminal and sat there waiting for a trip going back the other way to get us home to the crew house at the Dinge. And waited, and waited, and waited!!! Finally at 5pm, just before we went crazy, we saw the bus pull up and end our misery listening to constant passenger boarding announcements and watching the automatic doors open and close!

Zoltan and Husky were driving us back and we were on the road again! We made a dinner stop near one of the exits and watched perplexed as a whole heap of roosters, just roosters, no chickens! wandered around the trucks. Apparently they are always there and no one know why. Bizarre!

And finally we made it back! We helped to clean the coach, mop the carpets...???! Nod and smile! Nod and smile! :-) And about 10pm after what felt like a billion hours on the road again we were at the Dinge. But cant complain...it didnt cost us a cent!
 
THE volcano and the journey to Tour Leader, Wemledinge to London

2010-04-15 to 2010-04-23

Another few days at the Dinge (our crew house in Holland) studying ready for taking a trip to the Western Front for ANZAC Day and I was ready to hit the road again! I usually work as a cook, but I had been asked to take the tour as a Tour Leader instead due to my past military history experience which was quite an honour.



On the coach, driving to Calais, waiting at the terminal, on the ferry to Dover and bus back to London. Soon I will be doing this trip in my sleep! But hey, sure beats paying a fortune to get yourself back...especially after the Volcano had just erupted in Iceland and the entirety of Northern Europe was in chaos with all the airports closed, Eurostar booked out, the ferrys not taking any more passengers, no cars available for hire and CHAOS! The cost of a ferry ticket for a foot passenger ha d risen from about 16 pounds to 50 overnight and there were people trapped everywhere!! One of our drivers, Sutho was trying to get back to the Dinge from London to start his trip and after his flight was cancelled and couldnt get anything, he just caught a bus to the dock and was lucky enough to manage to get on! The news was advertising that no tickets were being sold, but people were taking the chance and queuing up anyway  the cars all jammed in at Calais trying to get somewhere! Our crew were all stuck in various locations across Europe and the middle east as well, trying vainly to get back in time to take their trips! Chaos! Some of our Tour Leaders trying to get to Turkey for ANZAC Day had to take a 3 day road trip cross country instead of a few hour trip flying, and a driver had to finish a trip, turn around and drive them there and then back!! Nasty!



Arriving in London, I headed out to my school friend Mabels place who was kind enough to put me up for the week whilst I studied for the tour. The weather was beautiful and we walked around Alexandria Palace Park, and had the first BBQ of the season  on the rooftop of their apartment block! So much fun! We had to walk up narrow windy staircase and go out onto the roof through the sky light. We had brought those disposable BBQs that have coals in a foil tray and cooked with chopsticks as we had no tongs! Michael (Mabels partner) also forgot to take the cardbox outside off as we watched it go up in flames....oops! As we sat there totally enjoying our charcoal BBQ, we started to smell something burning... the remains of the BBQs had managed to burn a hole through the roof...double oops! It was just a few layers of that roofing stuff though so it was all okay  it did smell really badly of tar though! Gross! But an awesome almost summer day!!



I spent the next few days doing lots of research, writing lots of notes, running around the park, doing awesome dinners with my flatmates and also dinner at my old pub  The Orange Tree -... and then it was time! I went into the office for my briefing, which took over an hour and a half to get there on the tube and bus and was told  you just meet your local guide. Hmmm... thats me I said. After some to and fro-ing they realised that that was in fact me... and therefore had no notes for me. Handy!!! Just as well I had spent the last week doing unpaid research and I had a lovely friend who put me up! They then gave me a giant box of t-shirts for my passengers and booked e a taxi home so I didnt have to take it on the tube, which was nice. SO I asked how I was to get to the station the next morning with the giant box....and my backpack and everything else. Just catch the tube! Nice! And so it was to begin!
 
10 minutes at 1 o&apos;clock - ANZAC day on the Western Front, France and Belgium

2010-04-24 to 2010-04-26

For those that remember I also spent last ANZAC Day on the Western Front as a tourist so felt very proud to be asked to take this years Topdeck trip as a Tour Leader. The Western Front from World War 1 in France and Belgium is where Australians lost the most soldiers and had some of their most horrific battles. Although this blog can not truly represent what an amazing experience the tour was, I hope you enjoy it still.



We had 30 passengers and I lugged my backpack, notes, and a giant cardboard box containing trip shirts from the north of London to St Pancreas station in the city!! I arrived at the station nice and early ready to pick up my tickets....and just as well! They firstly did not like my giant box being several metres away from me out of the way so I held up the line several times trying to move it back in to a place where they were satisfied that it was close enough to me. Then waited for about 20 minutes whilst the printer printed the tickets... and then couldnt pick up the last one as it wasnt in the group and it wasnt in my name and it blah blah blah! Finally success!!!



I met all my passengers, except 1 who didnt manage to make it, checked in and headed across the channel to catch the train from London to Lille, France to begin. We met our driver Seb, and boarded the bus for the drive to Ypes, Belgium where we were to spend the night. It is a really gorgeous walled city with moats, cobblestones, gates to enter, and beautiful old buildings that were pretty much all destroyed during the war and then rebuilt again after. The hotel was expecting a school group so were quite shocked when we rocked up! The rooms allocations didnt fit exactly, but it all worked out in the end and we headed into town to a local pub  well to a strip of bars we had been told about. Unfortunately Ypes strip of bars wasnt exactly the night life that we were expecting and so embarked on a walking tour of town to try and find some! We did find one in the end and had a nice hour chilling out before heading back to the hotel.



Checking out the next morning we headed out to begin the sites around the Flanders section of Belgium, starting straight to Langemark Cemetery, a German cemetery with 44,294 graves, included the remains of 24,916 unidentified German soldiers who had been interred in the newly created Comrades Grave at the front and the names of 3000 volunteer students.



Passchendaele was next, where the Australians fought and lost one soldier for every 5cm of ground gained and were then replaced by the Canadians. This was also the blackest day in NZ history for the amount of soldiers lost. The memorial shows the place that the Australians reached and also the Canadians first gained entry to the town of Passchendaele. It is hard to imagine the pretty country landscape and towns was once a complete muddy, barren moonscape.



Then to Tyne Cot Cemetery, where 11,952 Commonwealth servicemen of the First World War buried or commemorated, with 8,365 of the burials unidentified. The cross of sacrifice is located on top of a captured german pillbox and originally read 2nd Australian division captured this, until this was corrected to read 3rd Australian division in the 1990s.



By now I was starting to see a pattern... each site seemed to be just 10 minutes from each other and when I was pointing them out in the bus, they all seemed to be at the angle of 1 o&apos;clock! And so became the standard tour joke... 10 minutes, 1 o&apos;clock! :-)



And then in another 10 minutes...The Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing is a war memorial in Ypres, Belgium dedicated to the commemoration of British andCommonwealth soldiers who were killed in the Ypres Salient.It is the main gate into the city and where thousands of soldiers marched from out to the war. What I think is lovely is that the local volunteer firemen bugle the last post here each night and have done so since the moment was built in about 1920. The only time this did not occur is when the town was occupied by the Germans during the second world war, but it began again the day the town was liberated. The lions from this gate were also donated to the war memorial in Canberra where visitors now pass through to enter the memorial.

There are also filled in bullet holes visible from fighting in the second world war.

Walking around the beautiful town of Ypes everyone had the opportunity to sample some world famous Belgium chocolates, waffles and fresh produce at the markets going on in the main square before we headed off to Hill 60.



Hill 60 is amazing  it is the site of the underground war where Australians, British and Germans tunnelled underneath the hill (which was made by spoil from a nearby railway cutting) and placed explosives. It was ridiculously dangerous, soldiers dying from asphyxiation, hand to hand fighting when the tunnels met, or being killed or buried by explosions. Very nasty. The site remains pock marked from the explosions and shell fire and is a war cemetery with soldiers still laying where they died so many years ago.



Buttes New British Cemetery at Polygon Wood was our next stop and the 5th Australian Division Memorial located on the stop butts of an old firing range. Here are also the 5 graves of the soldiers known as the Zonnebeke 5  Australian soldiers that were found during digging for gas pipes just a few years ago. Johan, the proprieter of a local cafe who is a history buff assisted with the excavations and using DNA testing to find their relatives in Australia. It is a beautiful story about how some families back in Australia managed to locate their missing loved ones over 90 years after they were lost.



We then headed to see Johan at De Dreve cafe, Polygon Wood, www.polygonwood.com where he gave us a presentation about finding the Zonnebeke 5 and his involvement with the story which was really interesting. He is trying to raise money to build a memorial entitled soldiers in arms referring to one of the Zonebeke 5 who died in the arms of his brother to remember the soldiers. It is definitely an amazing experience  I was at the cafe last year and it is one of the things that I remember most vividly from the trip  (the others being the last post at dawn and the officer in charge of the excavation of the mass grave at Fromelles breaking down in tears as he told us the story)  it is amazing his knowledge, interest and passion in the war, and remembering the soldiers who fought and what they achieved. Absolutely amazing.



Ploegsteert Wood was next  the site of the Christmas Truce in 1914, where soldiers on both sides lay down their arms on Christmas day and joined together in no mans land, singing carols, swapping rations, burying their dead and even an impromptu football match. No Australians were here at the time, but it is a beautiful story and the Australians fought here later in the war. This was just a little cross on the side of the road in the middle of the Belgium countryside so I just loved our driver Seb as he somehow managed to navigate straight towards it!



We also stopped at Toronto cemetery, a little piece of Australia  the only totally Australian cemetery in Belgium which was a down some old dirt roads that we managed to get the bus all the way down after a brilliant 3 point turn on a hairpin to get there!





Fromelles was next a combined operation between British troops and the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and the first time the AIF saw action on the Western Front. After a night and a day of fighting, 1,500 British and 5,533 Australian soldiers were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. TheAustralian War Memorial describes the battle as &quot;the worst 24 hours in Australia&apos;s entire history.&quot; It was a decisive victory for Germany, and the Australian and British losses were sustained without the Allies gaining any ground. Here there is the Cobbers statue and pillboxes on the old German front line. It looks towards no mans land and the VC Corner Cemetery that was made after the Armistice. It contains the graves of over 400 Australian soldiers who died in the Attack at Fromelles and whose bodies were found on the battlefield after the armistice, where not a single body could be identified.



It was therefore decided not to mark the individual graves, but to record on a screen wall the names of all the Australian soldiers who were killed in the engagement and whose graves were not known.



It was a beautiful sunny day and hard to imagine being here in the coldest winter in history almost 100 years ago.



It was straight to Amiens where we quickly checked in... or tried to quickly check in, but their lack of English, lack of helpfulness and lack of being able to assist took a lot longer than expected!!! Finally sorted into our lovely stinking smoking rooms and straight into Amiens town for dinner. It was a go go go as there is only a certain amount of hours that drivers are allowed to drive in Europe (recorded on the coach tacograph) and we had to be back for the required driver rest period. Arriving in town, I had received a message from one of my best friends Monty and her husband Mick that they had arrived in Amiens and were waiting for us at a pub. It was a nice walking tour of Amiens as we made it and had a great time catching up...and waiting for food  about 15 minutes before we were due back the food arrived, we scoffed and picked up and ran back to the coach, a 10 minute run through the French town as everyone was laughing at us, but we made it back! Sweating and puffing I jumped on the bus with 2 minutes to spare. Sorted! And everyone made it back  luckily  as they did a lock down at 11pm!



And time to sleep! In just a few hours we would be waking up nice and early for the dawn service. Just after 3 it was time to put on every layer in the backpack and jump on the bus ready for the cold. We arrived into Villers Brettonneux and gained really good seats up the front which was awesome. Unfortunately due to disruptions from the Volanic ash fallout, some key personnel had not been able to make it and were replaced by people from the UK. The catafalque party had also not managed to get their weapons across and so mounted this without them. The dawn service was amazing and watching the bugle play the last post as light dawned over the battlefields was something you will never forget.



We managed to meet up with Monty and Mick again which was awesome before it was time to head off. We drove into Villers Brettonneux town and straight to the Victoria School that was rebuilt with donations from Victorian school children after the war  the same children who had lost family members throughout the war. The town still thanks the Australians for its liberation and has a never forget Australia sign in the school yard and above all the blackboards, and kangaroos in the windows. It was definitely amazing.

We headed back to the hotel for breakfast and de-layered and got ready for battlefield tours of the French Flanders and Somme region battlefields. We started at the Australian memorial at Le Hamel which has old German trenches there and was one of the turning points of the war. Even though it was a relatively small assault by western front standards, it demonstrated how tanks, infantry, artillery and aircraft could all work together in an advance. The methods trialled at Hamel were used in the British advance for the rest of the war. The battle had cost the Australians about 1400 men and the Americans 176. But the Germans had lost more than 2000 killed or wounded, plus 1600 taken prisoner. Additionally, the Australians captured 179 machine guns and 32 trench mortars, plus a newly devised anti tank gun. The battle was planned for 90 minutes..and took 93.



The quick victory at Le Hamel, even though a minor one, gave Allied leaders then meeting in Paris a distinct morale boost. The French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, who made it his habit every weekend to visit a French unit, was about to send the AIF a congratulatory message but decided, No, Ill go and see them myself. Accompanied by Lieutenant General Sir John Monash, Australian Corps commander, Clemenceau spoke in English:



When the Australian Army came to France, the French people expected a great deal of you  We knew that you would fight a real fight, but we did not know that from the beginning you would astonish the whole continent  I shall go back tomorrow and say to my countrymen: I have seen the Australians. I have looked into their faces. I know that these men  will fight alongside us again until the cause for which we are all fighting is safe for us and our children.





We visited the 3rd Division memorial at Sailly-Le-Sac for one of our passengers, the NZ division memorial at Longeuval and the Caterpillar Valley NZ cemetery before moving onto the windmill and Pozieres. Australians best remember 1916 for the heroic capture of the Somme town of Pozieres, a magnificent achievement that cost the Aus divisions 23000 causalities in 6 weeks of bitter fighting.



No site on the western front has a greater association with Australian courage and sacrifice than the French village of Pozieres. The fighting in 1916 cost the lives of nearly as many Australians in 6 weeks as the entire 8 months of the Gallipoli campaign. If the anzac legend was born at Gallipoli, it grew up at Pozieres.



Before the war, a windmill had stood north east of the town. It was destroyed early in the fighting, but the germans had turned the foundations into a formidable machine gun post and, as the highest point on the battlefield, it commanded the surrounding areas... the site where Australian troops fell more thickly than any other battlefield of the war.

Then to Beaumont Hamel, the newfoundland memorial park in recognition of the newfoundland regiment who were massacred in the battle of the somme on 01 July 1916. It is an amazing war cemetery with preserved german and allied trenchlines and no mans land in between.



Lunch was at Ulster Tower, a replica of the Ulster tower in Ireland, in memorial of the Ulster division who attacked here at the Battle of the Somme as well. Phoebe and Teddy, a lovely old irish couple run the cafe and from here it was another minutes towards 1 oclock to head to Thiepval Memorial to the missing.



The Memorial to the Missing at Thiepval, and cemetery behind it, is built right across the front lines of 1 July 1916, a day when the British Army suffered nearly 20,000 men killed and a further 40,000 wounded. The memorial, howeveris for the whole Battle of the Somme and recorded the names of more than 73,000 British missing soldiers whose bodies were never found for burial or, if found, could not be identified. It remains the largest British war memorial in the world.



Bulecourt was our final stop - the australains advanced to the town of Bullecourt and faced the Hindenburg line itself. In that month and the next, they launched 2 major attacks against the German defences. The first was a disaster and shattered the attacking Australians divisions for no result. The second was better planned and was ultimately successful, but cost the Australians thousands of men.



These battles were amongst the most ferocious ever endured by Australian troops and cost the 4 divisions more than 10 000 men.



For several months in 1916-1917, German engineers had worked tirelessly to construct a complete trench system, known as the Hindenburg line, several kilometres behind their current front line. They then abandoned the positions they had spent so much time and blood defending and withdrew to this line. Not only was the Hindenburg line straighter and shorter than the original German line, therefore requiring fewer troops to hold it, the Germans had now thrown into disarray the entire allied plan of attack for 1917.



Additionally, as the new line had been constructed in the safety of the rear area, it was built with maximum attention paid to defence and fortification. Multiple lines of trenches had been dug deeply and strongly reinforced. Concrete shells and machine gun posts had been built in strategic locations. And the whole thing was protected by the best barbed wire defences ever seen in the war. Thousands of kilometres of wire had been strung out before the front line trenches, extending over 50m into no mans land.



The 2 battles at Bullecourt marked the end of a bloody chapter in AIF history. Even though they shook the faith of the Australians in their British commanders, this was their last attack of the war where the objectives were unimportant or the planning inadequate. The Australians had matured as a fighting force and would now be used as crack assault troops by their British commanders, in attacks that had been well devised and well led. The second battle of Bullecourt had cost the Australians 7000 men.



In the town there were also memorials to the divisions that took part in the 2 great battles. One memorial is unique as the memorial is an original first world war slough hat, bronzed to protect it from the elements.



The flags of the Australian memorial park also mark the site of the 2 lines of German trenches attacked by the Australians. The focal point of the park is the bronze statue of a digger in full kit looking out over the battlefield from a German perspective.



We struggled to get into Bullecourt as there were many traffic disruptions and our bus kept getting refused from the policemen blocking off the roads. In the end Seb dropped us off and then I walked the passengers through town and up to the Australian Division Memorial. It was great timing as we caught the end of the ANZAC service and were hoping that Seb could come and pick us up somewhere, but he kept getting bad directions from policemen on different points and that he couldnt come and collect us.



In the distance I could see the bus coming across the roads through the fields and then before I knew it, the bus had pulled up behind the memorial. We all jumped on and during a break in the walking traffic of people leaving the service we drove along the road, picking up an elderly lady for a lift who was struggling to walk the distance. It turns out she used to help organise the commemorative ceremonies before the Australian Government had taken over! She was super cool and it was an awesome little drive chatting with her and her waving to her husband and friends from the front of the bus as we drove by. WE then drove out through the village the police had refused to let us in and as we pulled up at the roadblock behind them to get out they turned around in astonishment at us as we smiled and waved, then just cracked into smiles, gave us a thumbs up and let us out laughing. Nice!



And then it was time to head back to Lille! It was an amazing trip and there was just time for a quick drink before we jumped on the Eurostar back to London...unfortunately losing one passenger the English wouldnt let through! He did make it later that night though. It was an unbelievable trip back on the train, full of Aussies and Kiwis and it was just like being in a pub on ANZAC day back home as everyone congregated drinking, playing 2up, bar games and general socialising. And then back to London! Lots of sitting on the tube before making it hoe to Mabels late at night definitely ready to sleep for a week!



I hadnt been to a lot of the places so I researched them all, looked up photos so I knew what I was looking for, and then used google-earth to pinpoint them  brilliant! As we arrived to each location it looked so familiar it was like I had already been there! Genius!! :-) I was so glad I had done all the study as it really paid off, I really enjoyed the trip, Seb our driver managed somehow to get us to every single random landmark cross on the side of the road that I asked and the passengers were all super interested and supportive, making it a truly amazing trip. Overall I had done about 25 spiels and many orientation tours too. Lots and lots of talking!!! :-) Definitely an amazing opportunity that I was very proud to have taken :-).
 
An ANZAC journey on the Western Front

2010-04-27

From Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium to the Somme region of France is 133 kilometres by road. The landscape between the two towns is strewn with reminders that this was a vast and historic battleground. In the middle of fields, around bends in country roads, on hillsides and in villages, towns and cities are hundreds of cemeteries. They hold the victims of battles whose names were once known throughout the English-speaking world  Somme, Ypres, Villers-bret, Fromelles, Bullecourt, Amiens. The northern third of the Western Front ran through this region during the Great War of 1914 to 1918. Responsible for its defence were the forces of Great Britain and its Empire assembled into a combined army  the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).



The men of the Australian Imperial Force and New Zealand Division, known as the ANZACs, came to the Western Front in April 1916. The diggers, as they became known, went into the trenches in the French Flanders region and from then until early October 1918 they fought in virtually all the major campaigns of the BEF against the Imperial German Army. On 11 November 1918, as the AIF was preparing to go into battle once again, the Armistice was declared. During those two and a half years 295,000 Australian soldiers fought on the Western Front and 179,537  60 percent  became casualties. More than 48,000 of them were killed in action or died of wounds. 61000 in WW1.



 The total population of New Zealand in 1914 was just over one million.

 In all, 120,000 New Zealanders enlisted 12% of the population, of whom 103,000 served overseas.

 A total of 18,500 New Zealanders died in or because of the war, and nearly 50,000 more were wounded and 12,500 died on the Western Front.



Thousands of allied forces lie in cemeteries tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Each of them has an identical headstone on which is engraved a name, unit and date of death.



Others are buried but have not been identified and their headstones carry inscriptions such as An Australian Soldier of the Great War  Known Unto God or A New Zealand Corporal of the Great War  Known Unto God. These men make up one part of the missing who have no known grave. The other part of the missing consists of thousands Allies of whom nothing was ever found for burial and their names are commemorated on memorials.



Today there is little to see which resembles what the Western Front was like when it was a maze of trenches and cratered landscapes. But standing in the Cemeteries or driving around the roads of the Somme it is possible to sense the terrible nature of the conflict which once raged in this countryside. At each memorial and cemetery the commemorated names point to personal stories of battle and the sadness that each mans death brought to family and friends far away.



On such a journey it is impossible not to see that Australians and New Zealanders fought as part of a huge Allied force composed of the soldiers of many nations. Some of the locations visited tell of the experiences of British, Canadian and Newfoundland soldiers as well as the enormous bloodletting involved in Frances efforts to drive the German army from its soil. The negotiations which brought an end to the fighting with the Armistice, which came into operation at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, in Paris where for the first time a Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia put Australias name to a major international treaty, the Treaty of Versailles. On that day, 28 June 1919, the Great War with Germany was finally at an end.



Many Aussies and Kiwis will never be able to visit the old Western Front and see for themselves where men and women from all parts of the Commonwealth and all walks of life fought and died in the often appalling conditions on the Western Front.



We should remember those Australians and New Zealanders of earlier times who longed to go to France and Belgium but were never able to. In the aftermath of World War I, thousands of homes throughout Australia mourned the loss of someone who went off to war never to return. That generation endured personal losses on a horrendous scale. The spouses, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, cousins and friends of those whose graves and memorials lay thousands of kilometres away lived in an age when overseas travel was well beyond the reach of ordinary people.



But the world has shrunk. Thousands now go to Gallipoli and now also the Western Front. While visiting the cemeteries and memorials we could lay a poppy for those who never had the opportunity to visit, and we could remember the anguish of the people at home, such as is dictated in memorian notices from the time:



Our loved one is sleeping his long last sleep,

And his grave we may never see;

But some gentle hand in that far distant land

May plant a small flower for me.

Frederick James Baker, 21st Batt, Oct 06, 1918. France.



Though I am far away dear daddy,

And your grave I cannot see,

I am always thinking of you,

As you used to think of me.

My daughter Ivy for Pte J.L. Nitchie, July 19. 1916
 
Queens Day in the Netherlands

2010-04-28 to 2010-05-01

Finishing my debrief at the office, I headed towards St Pancreas Station to catch my Eurostar back to continental Europe. On the way I got a text from a girl, Mel, who was on my ANZAC trip who wanted to meet up as she had brought me a book she had told me about with this amazing story, about a female surgeon, Dr. Catherine Hamlin who opened a clinic in Addis, Ethopia to help women who were dying of fistula after childbirth. How sweet was that!



And then it was back to sitting on the train again! Under the channel to Brussels and then a few trains to pull into our province where some friends, Seb and Brent kindly picked me up from the station about 11pm.



And it was summer! Chilling out and organising everything for my next trip which was leaving in 5 days took some time, but we also each night took the bikes out and did a city lights tour of Wemeldinge. The town looked gorgeous as it was all totally decorated up. It is just a small village, but every street had picked a theme and gone out of their way to do it. There was a Mexican street, world street, Paris, back in time amongst a few  it was awesome! And then at night the entire place was lit up with hundreds of coloured lights. So Awesome!! We even had powercords coming into our house through the windows to be able to light the area around us.



The first night we went out on our city lights night tour we started with a detour, just a small one along the dyke, but it was dark and before we knew it we were riding on pitch black roads, in the pitch black, with no lights on our bikes and oh oh! Chains were falling off, beers were being dropped and many almost collisions with cyclists coming the other way who couldnt see us. Trying to get back into the city we ended up on back roads in farms before we finally made it back to the bright lights of Wemeldinge. It was gorgeous as we cycled around and took photos and saw how proud the Dutchies were of their work. But it was definitely tiring! We didnt end up making it back to our house until almost midnight!! Ridiculous! Fun though! :-)



The next night as more crew arrived we took another tour, but this time not the specific route via Amsterdam! :-) And then the next night...the rain started!!! It was the night before Queens day and it was pouring, thunder and lightning! We were devastated for the locals, but all the decorations survived, and although the next morning, Queens day  30 April  dawned overcast, windy, rainy and freezing cold, the locals turned out in their thousands to wait for Queen Beatrix and her family. The entire town had been cleared of cars, barricades put up and it was impossible to walk anywhere!!! There was security and everything everywhere you looked. We rigged up a platform on top of beer crates in our back yard as she was to walk right past our house! It was super cool as the police revved up the crowd, singing songs and doing Mexican waves. She arrived on time, but walking took a while and she arrived about an hour after we were expecting her on our street, but we had been watching her progress on TV being televised live which was awesome.

Desperately hoping our platform would stay up, and trying not to die from the freezing cold weather we waited as she, her family and the rest of the contingent passed right in front of us, waving. So cool!



We had just a few minutes to attempt to dry off before the float parade started. And there must have been a float for every group in Wemeldinge! It was awesome! We are quite rural out here and they were all pulled by tractors totally decorated and it was amazing! Marching bands, kids, adults, everyone dressed and enjoying it! Brilliant! Walking around town a few hours later, they were still going down the back and the poor little children sitting in some of the floats looked a little bit tired! It was awesome to see such an effort though and the entire town out supporting it.



And so efficient! Within a few hours of the parade, all the bunting, barricades and everything had all been packed up and put away to allow free movement around the town again! The decorations were still out though and ready with the massive marquees set for the party that evening!

Greek Island Sailing...Epic Adventures!!! :-)



And then the first day was over!! Thanks goodness!! And we had some sunshine!! Double thank goodness!!!



Greece is an amazing country – each time I get there I enjoy it more and more! The people are so friendly and it is beautiful! The little ports we stop at are tiny finishing villages and we eat at local taverna’s run by cute little families. Even though the best we can mage in Greek is – ‘a fairy’s toe’ our version of how we say thank you, everyone in the little shops is still so friendly to us and gives us little treats when we go in!



As we sailed along we saw Dolphins playing and jumping out of the water and it was awesome!



Our first port we stopped at was Petrit where I ran over to see what fresh seafood was on the menu that evening and I was plonked down in a chair and given Ouzo and vodka and couldn’t leave until I had finished!! Now there is a reason that Greece is called grease – yup, it comes with everything!! Fried fish, fried meat, fried everything, served with...fried chips and covered in....olive oil!!!! Hello grease!!



I helped serve in the bar, poured all the pints and when it was time for dinner it was really hard as we had a girl that was allergic to citrus and they couldn’t understand that we couldn’t have any as it triggered her allergy! I had to stand at the door and take them all off before the plates went out!!!



We had Greek dancing that night with the father and son leading, holding tables in our mouths and them setting the floor on fire! So much fun! We just prayed for no more rain the next day!!



And luckily it was rain free – not hot! But beggars can’t be choosers!! We just motored straight to our next port with a 3 way tow to Corfu town where I spent the whole day steering as Nick and Ben, the sailing guy were busy trying to sort out the broken boats!

Corfu town was beautiful – there was a large old fort overlooking the town and harbour which was stunning and the town was so cute! There were markets on full of delicious looking pastries, sweets and ice creams before Tals and I found a little backstreet and a cool little traditional cafe where we ate a delicious feast of sagunaki – fried cheese (well Tals ate that! ), eggplant stuffed with feta and chicken, stuffed grilled capsicum and traditional moussaka. Delicious!!!



And finally day 3 gave us sunshine!!!!!!!!!! Yay!!! We had our first swim stop!! Chilly, but at least we could do it!!! Stopped at the beach, broke some more boats and had a sailing race back into the harbour. I ran around like a crazy woman trying to do the shopping for the next days meals, get the menu and find out what everyone wanted for dinner and order lunches before everything closed. Let me tell you trying to explain coelliac or gluten free was the biggest challenge I have faced so far!!! It took about half an hour and I still never got there!!!! Hilarious!!! And then it was over, after an absolutely epic adventure we were on the road again!!!
 
Greece and Turkey

2010-05-23 to 2010-05-28

Out of Plateria and onto Corinth Canal to watch some of our group bungee jump off. For some reason we had heaps of time there this year and as I leisurely wandered around the supermarket I realised there was a whole upstairs level accessible a lift in the corner full of so many awesome products that I had no idea about last year!



Of course as we arrived into the Athens campsite it started raining...again! and we all jumped off the coach to set up in it...again! Every single city it has rained on us so far!! It was an odd set up in this campsite – setting up the cooktent under their semi covered area full of random poles so it was another tetris mission to try and manoeuvre it into position!



And Mexican night! Yum! Before we set up to sleep under the coach. The campsite was full so we had to park the coach on the street. The campsite and houses around went into lockdown with their gates closed and high fences and I realised that I couldn’t get out of the campsite to my ‘bed’ under the coach in the luggage bins after brushing my teeth. Pyjamas on, toiletries in hand, and towel over my shoulder I scaled the wall only for Nick to then tell me that the gate was unlocked.... Hilarious!



After brekky the next day we dropped off the passengers and headed out to the Supermarket to do the grocery shopping. We had to park a fair distance away in the coach and there is no simple way out so we took the trolleys down the escalators, up the car exit and along the roads until we got back to the coach. The local cars loved us! Not :-).



Athens – Meteora via Thermopylae

Sunshine!!! The first day in over 3 weeks that it didn’t rain on us for an entire day!!! Driving through the Greek country side we stopped off where King Leonidas and a force of 300 men fought literally millions of Persians at Thermopylae in 480, which the movie 300 is based upon. It was awesome! The countryside was amazing too – the mountain ranges were massive, it was crazy to think they fought through there.



And then Meteora! I love this place. The massive rocks just rise out of the ground as you drive towards them. It is amazing! We headed straight up to the 600 year old monasteries built by the monks with ropes and pulley systems on top of the cliffs. Definitely a totally amazing place and one of my favourite places in the world.



Sitting on top of the rocks looking around you really do feel so insignificant! Down the beautiful windy roads with gorgeous views into camp where we were dwarfed around by the cliffs. I had ordered giant pork chops for dinner and they were definitely on Greek time – ‘yes,yes, yes, maybe half an hour, or an hour they will be ready’ I was told!



Luckily they did only take just over an hour so I did have time to cook them for dinner!!



All sorted and dinner served, the sun was about to set so I quickly grabbed my runners and joined some passengers as we ran quickly trying to find our way to a peak to watch the sunset. But instead found an even cooler path that took us right up to the rocks where houses were literally built into the cliffs, hundreds of metres up, with ladders to get there. Totally amazing!!



We continued bush bashing and walked hundreds of stairs to find an old school in the hills...amazing! and lots of awesome sights. Light was going as we returned to camp, but it was the coolest jog/hike ever!!



Meteora to Kavalla, Greece



Single night stops continued as we made our way down to Kavalla. It is a cool little spot as we set up camp right on the beach as the passengers swum and played volleyball before dinner. As sunset hit, Joe, Ricky, Nick and I headed along the promenade for a run together with beautiful views of the bay beginning to light up.



We found a hill and begun hill sprints until we could run no longer and headed home... what an awesome place for an awesome run!



Kavalla to Galipoli, Turkey



The next morning after another gorgeous sunrise over the ocean we headed off towards Gallipoli where I took over the tour leading duties and did the brief as we arrived on the peninsula to see ANZAC Cove, Lone Pine and all the famous sights. I have been there now 3 times, but I still find it such an absolutely amazing place, particularly to wander around the cemeteries and see all the ages and names and inscriptions of a lost generation.



We were also warned about ticks – apparently 4 men had died from Congo fever from ticks in the last week! It creeped the passengers out as I walked past the tents later that night I could hear the passengers talking ‘ ah, I have something on my leg..is it a tick’??!!! Hilarious! :-)



A fantastic Turkish buffet at the campsite followed, but it took me about 10 minutes to try and find out what was in what dish so I could tell all our dietaries, but none the wiser - I just had to tell them I tried my best and do what they thought!



The campsite was again on the beach as we headed down to enjoy the gorgeous sunset and take many silly photos in silhouette.



And still we continued in the land of no flushing toilet paper when you would enter a toilet and find a nice overflowing bin right next to you full of dirty toilet paper...delightful! And you always had to remember to carry your own as the toilets never seemed to supply it when you need it!



I was also chatting to a random guy from Sydney whilst at the Gallipoli campsite and he turned out to be a diver on the ‘beneath Gallipoli’ research team that was there from Australia! Channel 7 was also there doing a documentary about them and that day had just been diving on a supply ship off the coast and mapping everything that was out there. Pretty amazing stuff!



E spent another night sleeping under the bus and boy was it cold!!! Ridiculous!! But.... here we had the third hot shower of our trip!!! Exciting!! Not so exciting when you think about the fact that now makes 3 in 4 weeks, not good odds at all, but at least they came when we needed them!



Gallipoli-Istanbul, Turkey



Off to Istanbul! Super exciting for us as it is 3 days in a hotel!! Sp pretty much a holiday, even though I still had to organise dinner at local restaurants and shop! We had a fantastic dinner at Doy Doy’s,overlooking the Blue Mosque before partying at the Sheisha Bar into the night.



And the most exciting thing... a sleep in! Even the Muslim call to prayer didn’t wake me! I did the grocery shopping and went to collect our laundry that we had placed in the day before after wandering around the streets for ages to negotiate a good rate. And what a mess!! It was still damp, smelt of smoke and mixed into a massive massive pile with 7 other peoples. It took us forever to sort it all out and when we had realised our underwear was missing!! Nice! Laundry – Turkish Style! It was definitely hilarious trying to sort it all out though!



After some street Turkish Kebabs and then a wander around the streets and to the Grand Bazaar before chilling out with our passengers and some drinks for the night, and grandly falling down some stairs...oops! All was well though! :-)



Another amazing sleep in and then... The walk to Asia!! As Turkey straddles both the Europe and Asian continents we headed over to the waterfront and crossed the bridge over the Phospherous Strait – a very strategically important waterway throughout history that many wars have been fought over! Very cool! Asia! Wal-la!



We brought snacks from Nut Man, cucumber man, corn man, bread man and plum man, all just selling goods by the side of the road and then fired pistols or guns filled with pellets into balloons in the ocean from the promenade. Only in Asia! :-)



OH yes...and it rained again! Every country thus far! :-)



We walked back through the Spics Markets and our epic 4 hour walk was over as we met our new passengers and headed to dinner. We sadly said goodbye to a few more passengers, Goodbye to Istanbul and Goodbye to hot showers, beds, sheets and fresh towels!!
 
Eastern Europe = Bulgaria and through the former Yugoslavia&amp;the;most beautiful places in the world

2010-05-29 to 2010-06-07

Istanbul to Sofia, Bulgaria



We arrived at the border and...wait wait wait wait! Then through! As we all lined up using a counter about 2metres high to try and pass all our passports through to pass.



First service stop in Bulgaria led us to delightful little toilets that flushed over the floor as you stood there on a grate in the cubicle! Delightful!



Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd rain! Just for a change! Every country!!! It semi cleared as I was dropped off on the side of the highway to go shopping at the Metro Supermarket... literally the side of the highway! I had to walk along the road, under an underpass, past hookers waiting on the side of the road, had trucks slowing down, honking and stalking me, attempting to avoid being hit by flying cars, then spent a good 5 mins waiting, attempting to cross before having to take my life into my own hands and bolting across. Continuing to trek towards the building in the distance, I attempted to find the entrance, but ended up in a dead end full of whistling construction workers. I finally made it there about 20 mins later to be told off (...well apparently, I couldn’t understand her!!) for taking a trolley in from outside – you are supposed to get them inside! Weird!



And then shop! Lots of alcohol, soup and teas...but not much else! Straight into town for the world’s fastest dinner before we met our passengers to take them back to the hotel. I love this hotel because they change the lift mats every night at midnight – I waited up last year to see! They say the day of the week on them, and on the dot at midnight a little lady came out to swap them! :-)



Argh! Pouring rain! Again! And so it began again...all our clothes and shoes that had semi dried whilst we were staying inside a dry hotel again became wet! We attempted a packed lunch in the rain and wind before we headed towards the border!



Sofia, Bulgaria – Belgrade, Serbia



We arrived at the border and were told to clear EVERYTHING off the bus whilst they checked it. Dreading what was to happen next it was actually surprisingly quick as we had our passports stamped and we were through to Serbia! Woohoo! We made it! The former Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia and names of cities such as Belgrade and Sarajevo which I grew up hearing about being at war in the news and hearing about bombs being dropped on them.



The roads were surprisingly good and the country was a lot more advanced then I expected. Driving into Belgrade we saw the shells of buildings that had been bombed only about 20 years ago, it was really eiree.



The locals were also so friendly and helpful and everyone we interacted with seemed to speak really good English as well.



We were dropped off in the main square and got some local currency.... several thousand for the night :-) and met up with Emma – an English girl with Serbian family who had left the trip in Athens. She took us all to a local ‘grill’ which is basically streetfood which was MASSIVE MASSIVE delicious, fresh hamburgers with fresh Turkish bread and lots of delicious salads and toppings for less than 2 euro! Bargain!! Apparently street food is the way to go in Serbia! Delicious!



And then to a local cafe where we could get cakes...and alcohol! Random!! And a vodka orange for less than 2 euro again. We like this country! :-)



Belgrade, Serbia to Sarajevo, Bosnia



We left the rain and began the drive through the most amazingly beautiful country. Bosnia is absolutely stunning!!!! So green and mountainous and the roads were fantastic...although we did have to wait forever at a tunnel whilst a tractor went about its business!



The roads from Serbia heading into Bosnia were terrible though – so run down, small, full of potholes and it was a relief to get inside Bosnia and escape them! Even if it was twisty and slow, it was awesome! And as an added bonus the border crossing went really smoothly as well!



We set up camp and attempted to find directions to the local restaurant where I had organised to have dinner. I took a pen with me, only to find that the inside had fallen out...weird?? As I sat there pondering how on earth that happened I headed back to the bus to find that every single one of my pens insides had somehow ‘fallen out’! Scratching my head I then realised that they had been removed and replanted into my basil plants Boris and Doris!! To this day they still do not fit back together!!

Heading into town we were absolutely stunned with the amount of shrapnel, shell and small arms fire damage on the buildings. Very few were left unscathed and there were also some that were still rubble.



We passed the Holiday Inn where the journalists stayed during the war, past the Latin Bridge where Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated which led to the start of WW2; and into sniper alley which was full of several storey buildings where snipers all used to sit on top of during the war.



Attempting to walk back and find the Latin Bridge, I randomly asked a local standing on the street corner who did not speak a word of English, but proceeded to tell Tals and I the history ( in Bosnian) and walk us to the bridge, the plaque commemorating the event, and then for about an hour and a half all around the city, seeing ‘Sarajevo Red Roses’ where mortars hit and left impact marks on the roads which have been filled with red paint as memorials; the market where a massacre occurred, memorial sites, the first cathedral, and so many other amazing places.



Just to be there, to see where it all happened only a few years ago, and to be taken there by a local was totally unbelievable, definitely one of my most amazing experiences ever.

Thanking our wonderful new friend we headed to dinner where we had a traditional Bosnian meal, and then to Pirates bar where they didn’t have enough change for us to pay for our own drinks!! Welcome to eastern Europe!



Back to camp...and rain, rain, rain, rain rain!!!! Another super cold night, flat mattress with the bus on a crazy angle that we were jammed into the wall, trying to get up and warm up, the showers flooded and all my clothes got wet!!!! Luckily one of my super helper passengers, Holly was there to loan me a dry top so I could get back to the coach!!!! Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!! :-)



Sarajevo, Bosnia to Dubrovnik, Croatia via Mostar, Bosnia



Just a few hours down the road we hit Mostar, a Bosnian city almost totally obliterated during the war and then rebuilt.



We parked by possibly the highest church in the world! And walked to Stari Most – a 21m tall bridge over the river that you can jump off! Red Bull extreme jumping championships jump from here! A few of our boys paid 25 Euros and did it! They first had to hose themselves down with a freezing cold hose to reduce the shock when they hit the water (24m due to the water level!!) Ridiculous!!! But absolutely awesome!! They wouldn’t let the girls do it, and I can kind of see why after all the boys got really sore feet/butts/backs from the impact of hitting the water at 80km/hr. Mick also got MASSIVE bruises all down the back of both his legs from it and most of the boys were sore for days! It did look spectacular though!



Stari Most, the bridge is a symbol of the town, it was damaged, destroyed and then totally rebuilt to exactly the same way that it was.



We left Bosnia, past hundreds of cemeteries along the side of the roads from all thte fighting in the region to drive along the Croatian Dalmatian Coast to Dubrovnik. It was definitely pretty, but I think I prefer the Italian Amalfi coast! It was very rugged, rocky and all the houses have the same colour terracotta orange roofs.



Dropping the passengers off in town, Nick and I headed to the supermarket...but it was closed... as was the next, the bank, the money exchange and argh!! All of them!!! Why??! How??!!! So Bizarre! It was not a public holiday and they all had opening hours on their doors that we were inside of???!! After driving around the entire town we headed back to camp dejected, to find the small camp store still open and so quickly brought them out of everything and concocted some kind of dinner from it!!!



The next day it was time to do some more grocery shopping, washing (finally!!!) and all kinds of exciting administration tasks before heading off into town!



Tals and I walked to the city walls at the old town and I suddenly understood the attraction of the place! It is a totally walled in city and you can walk 3km around the entirety of the fortress!! Amazing!!



The rain had started...again! as we sought shelter and ran into some passengers and joined them for a beautiful seafood dinner on the water. Mmm mmm!



Heading into a bar we found pitchers of cocktails and then into a fun club to dance the night away. We managed to catch the last bus home...but for some reason it didn’t stop at our stop and so in our definite wisdom decided to go cross country back to the campsite, through the knee high grass, through woods, under and over fences. Not sure if it was in any way quicker, but it was an adventure!



Dubrovnik to Zadar, Croatia



And yes, on the road again! It was definitely nice to have a 2 night stop though and be off the bus for a little bit that is for sure! It was another long drive day as we left Dubrovinik and headed to the Croatian town of Zadar.



It has an amazing musical organ on the beach where the tide plays specifically built ‘notes’ as it moves in and out. Very, very cool!!



Zadar was another walled city, but this time a really tiny one! And apparently, according to Alfred Hitchcock, the most amazing sunset in the world...but unfortunately we were not able to be around to see it.



Setting up camp, the place was totally full of retirees strutting around in their budgie smugglers! Crazy!! One was so grumpy he made me move the entire cooktent and all the equipment the manager had placed a foot forward as it was interfering with his satellite TV reception!!! The rest were all lovely and friendly though!



And we were sleeping under the bus again! So cold! And a week straight now I think!! At least the showers were warm here though. So nice!



Zadar to Plitvice Lakes, Croatia



Another cold night under the bus and it was onto the road again! In just a few hours of driving through gorgeous green mountainous scenery and amazing gorges we arrived at our campsite, right on the edge of Plitvice Lakes National Parks.



Setting up camp, and then we were into our hiking clothes and ready to be dropped off at the UNESCO world heritage site. Mass confusion when we arrived as we were only the second trip to go through and the notes were so wrong!!!! We finally sussed it out and were off! Our first view was of crystal clear emerald green lakes and waterfalls as the path meandered down, across boardwalks and then around them all for the next hour of stunning beauty and amazingly clear and coloured water before we reached the boat river crossing.



Another loop to start the next track of more equally gorgeous views! Amazing!! Several hours after we started we had completed the main trail. There were dozens of other trails to do too!! Catching the train back down it was perfect timing to catch the bus back to camp.



The camp was situated right up from a river and absolutely unbelievable. SO green, SO blue, SO clear and SO stunningly beautiful!! Unfortunately the water was cold enough to take your breath away, but I guess you can’t have it all!



Cooking dinner after vainly attempting to find the ingredients in Zadar proved to be interesting, but success in the end! And hot showers! What a day!!!
 
Hungary and Austria- Lands of Mozzies!!!

2010-06-08 to 2010-06-10

Plitvice Lakes, Croatia to Budapest, Hungary



A super easy border crossing and we were in Hungary!! Civilisation! Real Toilets!! No toilet paper, but hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day!



As we hit Budapest, the Danube River was so swollen it was sand bagged in places, flooding the closest streets, paths and all the cruise pontoons. Tree debris was stuck everywhere and it was too high for the cruise boats to ft under the bridges and come into the city.



We headed up to the Citadella with a gorgeous view over Buda and Pest, the two sides of the river Danube before I was dropped off randomly on the side of the road again to find the Metro, the train to get to the Auchan supermarket. And found! Not like last year when I was given dodgy directions and it took me so long to get there that the group arrived the same time that I did!



So different! Due to massive traffic, I had shopped, exchanged money (....more random currencies to fit into my wallet!!), gone to the post office, pharmacy and still sat on the rail in the bio food section for over an hour waiting til the bus returned to pick me up with Tals and her credit card to pay!!! Cooks really need their own!!!



And to camp! Where there was random flying flower fluff everywhere, the entire worlds population of mozzies and then the boys played centurion where they had 100 shots of beer in 100 minutes. Yup, let’s just say it was messy!!



Due to all the rain and everything being constantly being wet our chairs were starting to give along the seams. One minute you would be sitting there and the next minute....crash!!!! You would be on the ground!! Hilarious for everyone else!



Even our little cabin hadn’t been opened since last year and was delightfully damp and mouldy!



The next day Tals and I headed on what may possibly be the hottest and stuffiest train in the world and walked across the Bridge to the Pest side, had delicious frozen yoghurt, fresh fruit in the Market Hall and booked in for dinner.



We then caught the train and funicular up to the top of the hill overlooking the city at the Castle or Fishermans Bastian as it is known.

And with signs pointing in random direction declaring random distances; after many loops we finally found the labyrinth – a set of caves and tunnels underneath the castle eroded out by water thousands of years ago and utilised as various things during the war. One of the 7 wonders of the underground world!!! :-)



You are given a kerosene lamp and head into the cold, dark, wet tunnels with icy cold water constantly dripping down your neck!!! Spooky!! As we crept through, it is now a path from pre-historic man to now days with created paintings and carvings in the rock of animals from cave man times through the centuries until you reach a present day exhibition of the future looking back into our time. It has various devices from today, such as the pill, a hairdryer, toaster and toilet and a little blurb about each one like you would see in a museum! So cool!



There was also fountains flowing red wine, a GIANT stone head coming out of the ground and many other cool features in all the random dark little tunnels...even a massive (about 3m) coke bottle carving from millions of years ago.....yes.....................bizarre...................................!

It was also so spooky as you walked along, your kerosene lamp lighting up random stone figures along the walkway, giving you a massive fright!!!



We also got lost and couldn’t find our way out! Having to back track to the start to get directions!!

It was time to race to meet the group at dinner at a traditional Hungarian Restaurant where we had plates bigger than our heads full of food! We also found this awesome several storey local bar where people’s living rooms came off it, and full of randomness like bathtub seats!



And.....our first country with no rain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woohoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Budapest, Hungary to Vienna, Austria via Bratislava, Slovakia



Expecting a smooth sail through the border we were unexpectedly held up as the border officials in Slovakia insisted we buy a toll box for the bus instead of the usual road tax. Over half an hour later we finally made it onto the road again!



A quick visit to the castle overlooking the ugly spaceship bridge and hundreds of identical communist building blocks we were off to shop...and finally a store with pretty much everything I was after!!! Yay!!!



And finally into Vienna for some jumping shots at Schonbrunn Palace before we arrived at camp about 1845...over 10 hours on the coach!



We were yelled at by gypsies who had parked their cars in inconvenient locations and placed their guy ropes along the road as we attempted to navigate the bus through, but finally success! As I rushed to cook dinner and the wind tried to take away the cook tent and blow the gas out!



Again attacked by mozzies we attempted to jump under the bus before they invaded us!! And then realised our mattresses were flat! Due to the heat and cheap mattresses (that we had to pump up by hand as the nozzles wouldn’t fit the coach air points) they were developing holes at an alarming rate – about 8 a night!! We were constantly about out!



Vienna is a gorgeous city but we don’t have time to see it as we drop off, shop, head to camp to put all the groceries away, so washing and then pick up for the awesome Schnapps Museum tour and hanging out in the city until the concert finished so we could take the passengers home.



I walked along the pedestrian mall which was full of gorgeous buildings, people dressed up like Mozart selling concert tickets and buskers everywhere – a very cool atmosphere.



The show ran late and by the time we got back to camp it was almost 11 and the mozzies were out in full force!! I couldn’t even chop lunch without them swarming me. Nasty!!!!



Earlier in the trip we had somehow misplaces a joiner for the cooktent and in Vienna we had met up with another camping trip with the same style of cooktent. Sneakily my passengers went over and stole the joiner we were missing and fixed our tent. It was awesome, until the next morning when they went to leave and were looking everywhere for it, like it had run away. Hilarious! Unfortunately they soon realise and we were back down to minus one joiner!
 
Poland

2010-06-11 to 2010-06-13

Vienna, Austria to Krakow, Poland



Today most of the drive was through Slovakia and it is such a beautiful country! Large, lush green mountains, beautiful views and so untouched!



Our first service stop in Poland was at a regular servo...until we got inside and found the regions supply of pokies in little rooms in it! Hilarious!



But at least we were still back in the land of real toilets and toilet paper!! Woohoo!



Arriving into camp we set up in over 30’c heat trying not to dehydrate as I cooked a big boiling hot dinner! We can’t win! From one extreme to the other!!

Oh yes, and got totally eaten alive by mozzies – the worst yet!!

We caught an equally as hot tram into town and did a night walking tour which was really pretty, and even heard a choir competition in one of the many beautiful churches there.



And then to Wodka! (Vodka). Poland is known for its delicious, cheap and locally made wodka and so we thought it best to head down to the coolness of an underground bar to test it out!



Arriving home we attempted to stop the mozzies coming in, without avail, and then about an hour or so later we were woken by a frantic knocking on the bus bin doors where we were sleeping. Opening up to find it fully light...at half past 4! We found one of our girls whose friend was missing. After some questions of drunken, passed out and tired passengers and tent checks it was established she couldn’t figure out which tent was hers and so crashed in another...and that person had to crash on the ground inside the cooktent!! Success!!



Up super tired a little bit later to cook breakfast, shower, reapply mozzie repellent, sunscreen and sweat we were ready! ..ish! Another 30’C day and we struggled to move as Tals and I checked out Krakow until we could move no longer and headed to an awesome little restaurant where we ate a delicious meal of Perogi – a local dish of pasta/dough wrapping meat or cheese and potato. They look kind of like Chinese gyoza and they were amazing!!! We also tried clear beetroot soup! Delicious!



And rejuvenated!!! Walking to the castle we headed down underground into the ‘dragons den’ where legend has it that a dragon was living that the Prince slayed. It was so nice and cool there we didn’t want to leave! There was also an awesome replica dragon outside that breathed fire. Nice!

We finally made it back to the campsite and collapsed on mattresses in the shade, summing up the dedication to go and shop! When we finally did, the supermarket was a nightmare! Everything there was in such random locations in no commonsense format at all that it took forever to find anything!



But it was super cool that the girls who collected the shopping baskets and returned them outside wore roller skates and matching outfits!!



We spent all night being ridiculously attacked non stop by Mozzies and next morning I looked like I had been neated I had so many red welts on my face! Moral of story....long sleeves don’t stop mozzies – they just redirect them to your head!



And..............rain!! doh!!! We thought we had escaped!!! But we quickly packed up and onto the bus we were had our first service stop and I purchases a random bar – spray and wipe flavour!!! Yup, for serious! And in case you were wondering, it is even grosser than it sounds!!!
 
The final leg - Auschwitz, Prague, Dresden, Berlin, Amsterdam, Calais to Borselle and Wemeldinge!

2010-06-13 to 2010-06-19

We arrived into Auschwitz and after a tree had fallen during the storms the night before had to start our trip at Auschwitz Birkenau, the second of the Auschwitz concentration camps. I didn’t go into this section last year and I actually found it to have more of an impact on me. There were hundreds and hundreds of old brick chimneys left from where the living blocks were destroyed or have fallen apart. The railway line where the ‘prisoners’ were brought into the camp was still there and where they were sorted into whether they were going straight to the gas chambers or whether they were going to be used to work. There are the remains of all the gas chambers and a large memorial to all the people that were killed and it is really sad and sombre-



‘For ever let this place be a cry of despair and a warning to humanity where the Nazi’s murdered about one and a half million men, women and children, mainly Jews from various countries of Europe’.



We then moved back to Auschwitz 1 to head through the famous ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ (work sets you free) sign and into the tour with a local guide. It is really really fascinating and the interesting thing I noticed this year was that there were several people with either Kosch, Koch, Kosh or a version of Koschewnikow as their last name, so it would be so interesting to know my family history and see if any of my relatives were actually taken there at all. It was great having the opportunity to go again as you could take in so much more – the rooms with the human hair and shoes still got me equally as badly when I walked into them.



A long drive day and we arrived into Prague late as we set up and I cooked the last cooktent dinner for the trip! Woohoo! We then caught public transport into town to start the walking tour...and of course.... rain!!! We completed the walking tour huddled under any awnings we could find, Prague is a beautiful city but it was just so cold and wet!!! The walking tour took a few hours so we were super excited to finish and head into the beer factory where you can sit at a table and pour your own beers with a competition board to see which table to ‘winning’ who has drunk the most beer. And then off to the 5 storey nightclub! It was a weeknight, but it was still fairly well frequented and there is a retro floor with a light up coloured dance floor which was brilliant. One of our passengers, Jono was hilarious – he started with a dance off with one of the Prague Pub Crawl guys and then these local 18 years olds thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread and decided to copy his every move. So Jono was there in the middle of the dance floor doing the sprinkler, lawnmower, robot, do si do and any other random dance move that came into his head whilst they copied him, or joined hands around him and danced in a circle...it was THE funniest thing that I have ever seen!!!



Up early to cook breakfast that not a lot of people made it to! And then a well earnt nap! So tired by this stage of the tour!!! Tals and I then caught the tram and bus to the supermarket, and finally made it back to camp, dumped the shopping and headed in to see the Communist Museum http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/ which was actually really quite cool – Renowned political writer Timothy Garton Ash remarked: “In Poland the transition [from communism to democracy] lasted ten years, in Hungary ten months, in Czechoslovakia ten days.” Those ten days fell between November 17th and 27th, 1989 where on the first day of the revolution, a peaceful student demonstration ended with violence, when riot police blocked off escape routes and severely beat students. That first domino began an avalanche, as almost every day afterwards until the end of December brought more protests with more and more people participating. By November 20 an estimated half-million of peaceful protesters took to the streets, up from the 200,000 of the day before. A general two-hour strike that involved all citizens of Czechoslovakia was held on November 27th and there was an awesome video of these demonstrations and just awful footage of people absolutely beating people as they run away, it was so awful and I never really realised how bad it was! 2 students also set themselves on fire in demonstration as well. So sad.



We then headed to a nice little local restaurant where we ate a delicious feast of traditional dumplings and meat before we rolled ourselves onto the train home!



On the road again! Definitely getting sick of sitting on a bus by now as we headed into Germany but as we passed the border were pulled over by the police for a check of the driver. The driving laws in Europe are quite stringent and it happens a bit as Nick, the driver got out all his tachographs that record all his driving hours and speeds, and all the bus paperwork. Luckily it wasn’t too long and we were on our way again.... to Berlin!! We had a quick stop in Dresden for lunch where I pulled out he burners and made hamburgers by the side of the road like gypsies. So good!!



AND then.............to a hostel!! Woohoo!! We were staying in Wombats in the centre of Berlin which was an awesome change from the campsite last year which was an hour out of the city! The first night we had dinner in the hostel restaurant which was a nice grey sludge to start followed by really old potatoes, about 2 small chunks of meat and some cabbage! Needless to say I watched all the boys head out to Maccas as soon as it was over! We could hardly wait to get into our nice clean beds with pillows and doonas before we got up the next morning to head into town and go grocery shopping. Pulling out of the hostel on the way back we hear a bit of a crunch and see people standing on the pavement staring up at the bus. I hopped out to see the back of the bus smashed into a powerpole outside the hostel and Nick jumped out, looked at it, said ‘oh well, nothing we can do!’ and drives off!! Hilarious! We noticed that the window had been smashed though so stopped to knock all the glass out of the outside( they are double windows), and then gaffa tape the inside window. Now this is quite high!! So I end up standing on top of Nicks shoulders trying to gaffa tape the window!!! It must have looked ridiculous! And for what purpose we are still not sure – apparently the window would fall out, but looking at it, it is super unlikely seeing as it is held in place like a regular window...??!... anyway ask the transport manager!! And luckily neither of us died but it was crazy!!



I then had an opportunity to walk around the city and to Alexanderplatz before heading back to the hostel to get ready for the Berlin pub crawl! We all wore white t-shirts and had coloured marker pens and the night devolved into debauchery very quickly!

And our last drive day! And so long! It took us all day to drive into Amsterdam with the massive massive traffic jams that we encountered and couldn’t even get to our cheese and clogs demonstration. We just headed straight to the campsite, set up and were straight into town to get dinner before the sex show. The sex show is an optional we do on our tours and now having watched it several times it is hilarious to watch all the passengers faces as they sit there horrified! The show ran late and we had to run back to the bus so Nick didn’t go over his driving hours...but ended up doing so by 11 minutes anyway! Last day of tour! So ridiculous!



The bus was starting to break down and it was going out on another trip in a few days so Nick had to drive it from Amsterdam to the depot on our free day so we were kindly picked up from the campsite by another driver on a different trip – Tom Tom so we didn’t have to get up an hour earlier to catch public transport – but it was so well worked out by the Transport Manager that his group then had to catch public transport instead. Yep, good organisation! :-)



I love the bicycle tour of Amsterdam that we do, as everyone there rides you fit right in! We did see a massive crash though between a scooter and bike though...nasty!!! It was so funny listening to one of my passengers and she was like ‘I could hear it behind me and I just kept riding really fast in case it was my fault!’ :-) hilarious!!

Pancakes are massive in Amsterdam too, with the fillings cooked into them – like fresh strawberry and banana. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! :-) So Tals and I and another Tour leader Michelle went out to stuff ourselves before I headed back to the campsite to clean all the cook equipment before returning it to the depot – and of course... get rained on!!!



And the Sea Palace! For our last dinner of the trip we go to a lovely floating restaurant on the canal that serves.... Chinese. Yup, Chinese!! So we have to make up some storey about why we are eating there!! It is convenient though as the boat for the canal cruise picks us up from there to cruise the canals before we are dropped off into town for our last night of the tour.



The next morning it is a sorry sight as everyone packs up for the last time and as the campsite would not open their gates so early in the morning, tired and hungover everyone lugged everything up through the entire campsite and out the gate to our ‘new’ bus that was waiting for us – so much smaller than the last one but somehow we managed to fit everything in! We couldn’t find 2 of our passengers but I vaguely remembered a conversation about their cabin and so quickly ran over – a lot of the numbers were missing and I was yelling and they couldn’t hear me so I took a chance and walla!! Found them! They had 10 alarms set but had slept through them all!! Luckily we managed to get them up and moving in time to make the bus!



A very long and quiet day on the bus as we headed to the dock to drop everyone off to go back to London, it was sad saying goodbye to a lot of great people you have shared so much with over the past 49 days, but such is the nature of the job and being a traveller! And of course it rained - like a full cycle of the trip!! In the end after 49 days on the road and 19 countries, we had rain in every single one of them except Hungary and Austria!!! We had about 40 flat mattresses, 15 broken stools, a broken fire extinguisher and who knows what else!



After a super long drive day we made it back to the depot at Borselle and unpacked the coach into our old coach...waited for the next trip to get back and then drove them back to the depot at Wemeldinge... then unpacked our equipment, helped pack the next bus and 4 hours later we finally made it back to the house. SHATTERED!! And ready to sleep for a week!!



EPIC journey to destinations unknown :-)

Red Star Special - Scandinavia to Russia! Days 1&amp;2 Wemeldinge, Holland to Berling, Germany

2010-06-26 to 2010-06-28

Well, I have finally (well mostly!) caught up on sleep and washing and am up at 4am for the MASSIVE driver to Berlin! I am spending the next 37 days traveling through Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Poland!!! I can&apos;t wait! xxx





We were ready! About to embark on an amazing 37 days through Scandinavia and Russia, Billy, my driver for the next 37 days and I had packed the coach all ready to go with all our cooking and associated equipment the day before and were unpleasantly surprised by the lack of space available! We had pretty much used ¾ of the space underneath on equipment and we had no food or backpacks as of yet!



Also the day before we left, the transport manager had come around at about 2130h and dropped a bag in front on Billy – ‘Here you go’! In it were all the maps for our trip. And that was his briefing! – 37 days, 10 countries, city driving tours all totally blind. Needless to say this became a running joke for our trip when things didn’t go according to plan or we had no idea what was happening! Luckily we had some amazing crew and we knew everything would work out!



We were up at 4am to do the final packing and hit the road! I guess it was an indication of how tired we were that we spent about half an hour trying to figure out hot to turn the stereo on, gave up and spent the next four hours until our next service stop in silence! At the servo, Billy ran inside laughing – ‘we forgot to turn it on!’. We had hit every single combination of buttons possible...just not the one that turned it on! :-)



We passed one of the checkpoints used when East and West Berlin were divided – Checkpoint Alpha – and then we were in Berlin! Well, it wasn’t quite that fast – about 12 hours worth! We had made great time, but we were shattered.



Walking down from the bus with our day bags, backpacks and fridges we must have looked quite a sight! – what kind of backpackers travel with fridges?!



We arrived at Wombats hostel and entered the lift just as some other travellers got in, looked at us strangely and asked what we were doing. ‘To keep the beer cold!’ was Billy’s response! He wished though! They were soon to be filled with perishables for dinner the next night! :-)



We met our tour leader Ivan, who we and our passengers were to spend the next 37 days with and walked 10 minutes down the road to the Brau Haus which is definitely the best dinner I have ever had in Berlin! Although it took about an hour for the food to come out it was a starter soup and a giant pork knuckle with sides for all!!! Amazing! And just 12 euros per person!



It was hilarious as I went around to each table to find out any dietary requirements, Ivan introduced Billy and I, and then walked back with the group to the rooftop bar at our hostel... I went over to the girl from the lift who was asking about the fridge and started talking to her. She laughed and asked me how my tour was going.... ‘Sorry?’ I replied. She asked again if I was enjoying my tour, at which point her friend looked at her incredulously ‘K is our cook!!!’. The look on her face was priceless as she said ‘there is no way I can recover from that!’ Hilarious!!! In her defence though another Topdeck tour was in the hostel as we arrived :-). But still, hilarious!!



The next day we headed out to the giant bulk supermarket, the Metro. As everything is so expensive in Scandinavia we shop for pretty much everything we can for dry goods for the entire trip in Berlin.



Ivan and Billy were helping and it was so funny. We had Walkie Talkies and I had given the boys shopping lists in ‘Australian speak’ as Billy, our resident Englishman called it. So I spent the whole time laughing at poor Billy as he came over the Walkie Talkie ‘Um, what is the difference between a popper and a juice?’ ‘When you say lollies and lollypops aren’t they the same thing?’ Brilliant!



It was a MASSIVE effort... about 5 hours and 5 trolleys and a definite marathon effort. The boys were amazing, they were so enthusiastic at the start, and as the day wore on their faces just dropped lower and lower! It took us about an hour to check out and then another hour to try and tetris it all under the bus... failed dismally and turned the backseat floor into additional ‘pantry’ space as well called it! And then it was over! Absolutely shattered! And back to prepare for the next day.... Denmark!!
 
The Happiest Place in the world, Copenhagen, Denmark

2010-06-29 to 2010-06-30

Our packing nightmare continued as we attempted to tetris everything into the bus on departure morning. The backseat pantry was stuffed full of ingredients for the next few days, a few random backpacks and we were on our way!



We headed to the port and jumped aboard the Scandi lines vessel to Copenhagen, Denmark! Somehow five of our passengers had gone missing! We had no choice but to drive off as directed and pulled up a short distance away...and waited...and waited! Finally they came towards us, somehow managing to get lost!



We were pulled over by customs as we drove out and had to pull out bags as they had their sniffer dog jump in the bins underneath and then up past all the passengers on the bus!



It was definitely nice and easy to arrive in camp and go into cabins, with no tents to set up, just establishing the cooktent took no time at all!



A minor snag hit as we arrived though – the campsite didn’t want the bus driving on the road in the campsite...?????? and so we had to load everything off the bus and onto a small trailer where it was driven down by a tractor and the cycle continued until we had everything!



The boys headed off on reconnaissance and errands and got stuck in traffic as I did the first dinner solo! Luckily I had lots of lovely passengers coming to help out!



The driving tour of Copenhagen the next morning was awesome, the city is so beautiful! Definitely one of my favourites ever!! The highlight was heading to the site of the famous ‘little mermaid’ to find a large screen with a live feed of her from Shanghai where she is currently on loan! Hilarious!!



Ivan, Billy and I spent the entire free day walking non stop around the amazing city. We just didn’t want to stop! And taking about a million photos. We saw the city area and world’s longest pedestrian mall with buskers everywhere, and then headed to Christiania, the self-governing hippie type commune in the middle of Copenhagen city. It is prime real estate and full of markets, bars, cafes and hippies smoking! It is very very chilled out and totally laid back and so cool! We loved chilling out in there!



We headed out past many, many gorgeous buildings, the church spire formed of four intertwined dragons tails, amazing bakeries, the Kastellet, a beautiful star shaped military barracks, the lovely Kings Garden, pretty waterways and many statues of men on horses!



We met a friend of Billy’s for a drink and had dinner overlooking a canal. So nice! The Danish are all so friendly, so helpful, so nice and so good looking! There is nothing bad about this country!!! Oh yes... except for the price of everything. So to live here I probably would have to marry a prince!



Arriving back at camp the bouncy mattress was up! I am not sure what to call it, but it is about a metre and a half tall and about 5m by 10 m and a giant giant bouncy thing!!! So much fun!!!!! Every campsite should have one!!! :-)



We all totally fell in love with the city and the people. It is also apparently the ‘Happiest place in the world’ and we can totally see why! It is definitely my new favourite place!!!!
 
More statues of men on horses! Copenhagen, Denmark to Stockholm, Sweden

2010-07-01 to 2010-07-03

SUCH a treat having cabins!! Up early to put on lunch to cook 1 step away from my bedroom, then 2 more steps to the shower and all in the luxury of a nice, warm cabin!!



The camp lady nazi came and gave each cabin tthe white glove treatment, made some people reclean their cabins (apparently this is the way it is done in Scandinavia!, including watermarks on glasses!!! And then we were free!!



We loaded up the trailer, the camp guy hooked the tractor and up to the bus we went! Another marathon tetris effort and we were on the road again!



In just 45 mins we had reached the port, and awaited our ferry, looking over the gap in the water it looked like we could just swim to Sweden! And so many cyclists! It is awesome to see them all out and about all over Europe – just with saddlebags or a tent on the back and off they go! What freedom!



We stopped off on the way at the truly Sweedish institution....Ikea!! We dropped the passengers who promptly got lost for over half an hour trying to find their way out! Couple of lovely volunteers came with me and went food shopping. About four aisles of cheese and just 2m of poultry. Bizarre! It took forever though, but we finally made it back to pick everyone up!



And we arrived into Stockholm campsite! And there was stuff everywhere!!! All the items from the sop which were on top of the bus, stuff from underneath and food as far as the eye could see! A whole table covered and so many awesome passengers who all came out to help put everything away and then help me cook!!



In our crew cabin we allocated beds and Ivan had the top bunk. Billy and I had never seen anything funnier than him trying to get onto it! Bottom bunk for him for the next 30 days was the outcome of that!!! :-)



And then a quick change and in to see the city by night! I was so tired I fell asleep on the train in...and so came back. Ahh life on the road! :-)



It is so weird as it is still light until about midnight, and then the sun rises again by about 3am. So cool, but so screwy for your body clock though!



We spent the morning driving around Stockholm and did a tour of the City Hall where the Nobel Prize Ball is held every year. It is a really stunning building with such vastly different rooms – a stone room, a gold room, tapestry rooms and lots more! Gorgeous!



Walking through Gamla Stan, the old town and to Design Torget (http://www.designtorget.se/designtorget/se/ ) the awesome Swedish innovative design store, to the supermarket and back to cook dinner past many, many more statues of men on horses.



After dinner we had an awesome game of soccer and chillout on the beach. SO much fun!!



We were lucky enough to have three days in Stockholm and so the next morning headed into town to walk around the southern part before we all met to watch the Argentina versus Germany world cup match which was a lot of fun.



Unfortunately it was then time to attempt to find stuff in the mess of the tetris bus store area...and then repack it ready for the next days cooking! One side door was dented and would not open and so I finally managed to pull out enough stuff to make a space that I could crawl into and try and relocate things around me...... until I was trapped! It took forever to finally push everything back out so I could escape, but finally got there... a little claustrophobic, but alive! :-)



Sorting things out in the cooktent later a random drunken guy camped across from my cooktent kept trying to give me about 5 euro cents and have dinner with us! He was SO drunk that he was sleeping in a totally collapsed tent and the boys had to escort him to reception to have him kicked out as he wouldn’t leave us alone!!
 
A 15 hour drive, a 1930’s smoking caravan, dishes, death by air freshener and waking up with a mou

2010-08-05 to 2010-08-07

So, after a day sleeping, washing and catching up on life at the crew house in Holland, I began to investigate getting to my next work location. I attempted to shove my life into a backpack hat fitted the easyjet baggage restrictions ( no mean feat!!), failed dismally, and then turned to attempt to find my way there. And so.... walk to the bus, bus to Goes Station, train to Amsterdam (with one change), attempt to find airport, fly to Basel, attempt to find train, switch at Interlaken, arrive in Lauterbrunnen and walk to campsite. Oh, and start at 5am. As appealing as that sounded, when I heard one of the drivers had to drive down, I jumped at the opportunity to spend another long day in the car. Roadtrip! Brian was heading to Lauterbrunnen to pick up his next trip that had been driven by someone else for a day who would then take the car back to Holland. Yes, odd. But don’t ask! I didn’t plan it!!

We began the journey with a delightful driving tour of Brussels and as much as we enjoyed the pretty little city, we enjoyed more finally finding the right exit to the motorway! In jovial moods we began our journey.... until it decided to never end. Never, ever end. The daylight came and went, and we were still driving. An apparent 7 hour drive had already hit 15 as it edged towards midnight and we finally arrived in the beautiful Lauterbrunnen Valley in the Swiss Alps.

After driving from Berlin for 11 hours just 2 days prior I never, ever wanted to see another bus/car seat or motorway as I emerged a shattered and exhausted mess from the car. But all was well as we were welcomed by other Topdeck crew, and randomly one of the guys I used to work with in a pub in London – Andy – was in on a trip which was quite exciting. Other the next 3 days, two more passengers – Nick and Rachel from my Russia/Scandinavia trip also came through Lauterbrunnen on other Topdeck trips. An awesome surprise!!

I met Shelley, the other chef I was to be working with and she showed me to my ‘room’. I use the term ‘room’ loosely, as I was to be living in a 1930’s caravan type get up! It squishes in a sofa bed, a cupboard, and another sofa that converts to a bed when my room-mate arrives later this month. It scared me a little getting there as we walked through the entire camp, past the toilets, up the stairs and along a small road up a hill that went from asphalt to gravel, and in the pitch black looked for a flagpole as a landmark to turn into our street. Surprisingly enough I have not yet gotten lost in the dark trying to get home, touch wood! It is a little unfortunate when it is freezing cold and raining making the epic trek to the toilet block in the middle of the night, although I cannot really complain! A room to myself and my own bed is pure luxury at this point! It was so funny though I was soooooo so tired the first night that I arrived that I couldn’t even figure out how to turn the one light off. There are at least 7 different lights/light switches in the caravan, but only one of them works. The light that is – none of the switches do! And so the first night I lay on the bed shattered with the light in my face as I tried to sleep. Turns out that tiny random string nearby is its switch. Of course!

My caravan was previously inhabited by a smoker though and as much as Shelley did her best to air it and spray freshener and deodoriser, there is only so much you can do! At shopping one day we found one of those airwick auto spraying devices and thought it would be a brilliant idea. Nope! I turned it on and went down to dinner one night, returning several hours later to find the room filled so full of ‘freshened’ air that I couldn’t even breathe! So, apparently not suitable for mini caravan type enclosed spaces!!!

One thing about living in Switzerland is that you may possibly have the most amazing view in the world to wake up to! I lie in bed listening to the church bells tolling through the valley, the water rushing down the streams from the mountain glaciers, and as I walk outside my caravan in the morning, I am surrounded on both sides by massive, massive sheer cliffs, 72 waterfalls down the valley and as I turn to make my way to the toilets, the snow covered peaks of some of the highest mountains in Europe. Yep, pretty amazing!!



Also freezing though! The first night I arrived I am not even sure I slept, I was so cold...and let me tell you, attempting to pull things out of a fridge or freezer in the morning and attempting to chop them is not fun at all!!!! Luckily, the cold snap only lasted a few days and the sunshine arrived!!! Thanks goodness!! Back to paradise!!! :-)

There is also a zero crime rate in Lauterbrunnen, which is pretty lucky seeing as my door doesn’t even have a lock! There is no need, Debs, the campsite owner says!



I did begin work with an initiation by fire though – up early and straight into breakfast for 2 groups the next morning, a packed lunch, cleaning duties and then dinner prep. Full on! It is quite well organised though as we have a few hours off in the middle of the day where we can have lunch with the crew that are on, or just chill out. But then, back into the kitchen!
 
Alpine Horn Festival, Mannlichen and Trummelbach falls, Switzerland

2010-08-08 to 2010-08-11

I was lucky enough for my third day here to coincide with the ‘Grosses Alphorntreffen Mannlichen’, the annual Alpine Horn festival! Shelley, and I, both keen to go, got up early and did a massive crazy rush around to do breakfast and lunch for the groups and try and finish all the jobs we needed to do in time to make it up the mountain in time!

The festival was being held in Mannlichen and so with Clem and Allira, two crew in at the time, we walked down to Lauterbrunnen station and caught the train up the mountain to Wengen.



Walking through the pretty little car free town we then caught the cable car up the steep steep mountain to Mannlichen, the only way, besides hiking or biking to access the area.

As we arrived we heard the deep soulful sound of the horns and were lucky enough to see all the horn players lined up in their National dress, with flag throwers, dancers, singers and an amazingly beautiful mountain backdrop.



We were all stunned as we stood there listening to the beautiful music and sight before us. As the first concert ended we sat down for a picnic in maybe one of the most beautiful locations in the world. It was ridiculous to see the weather as well – as we sat there it went from sunny and fine, to clouds rolling in and putting everything in a white out, all in the space of less than 10 minutes! Unfortunately then the rain started, but it was soon to stop as we made our way up to the lookout.



Switzerland is famous for its cows with giant cowbells and as we walked up, right in our path were dozens of them! We tried to get past, but they were not interested in letting this happen as one went for my arm and started chewing on my jacket! Ew! Disgusting frothy cow slobber everywhere!!!! We did make it past though, and past all the fences built into the sides of the mountains which Tour Leaders enjoy telling their passengers are ‘cow catchers’ to catch the poor cows that fall off as the mountains are so steep, but really they are to stop avalanches! Arriving at the top, the cloud encased us again and the rain started. It was quite eerie to be standing on top of the mountain, surrounded by white clouds, seeing nothing and hearing the Alpine Horns playing off in the distance.



Unfortunately the rain persisted though and the horns made a dash for shelter and we made a dash for the cable car home, and back in loads of time to get back in the kitchen and prepare dinner. What a fantastic day though!!!



But then it was back into the kitchen with long hours – starting at 0630h and when 3 groups were in, not finishing the second dinner service until after 2230pm. We do get a couple of hours off in the middle, but still a long day on your feet!



I was so looking forward to mid week when due to a cancelled trip we had a night without a trip in to cook for!!! Yay!!! And so after doing breakfast, lunch, cleaning and shopping we were free for the night! I quickly started hiking down the road to see Trummelbach falls. It is a gorgeous 45min path along the river with the mountains surrounding you. As I walked the weather turned from fine as the clouds rolled in and the heavens opened up and drenched me. Luckily it was still quite warm so all was well, and quite comical to watch all the other random walkers dashing for non existent cover.



Trummelbach are 10 glacier water falls inside a mountain, the only ones in Europe, and made accessible by a tunnel lift, various paths and stairways and illuminated inside the rock. These waterfalls alone drain the glaciers of 3 massive mountains nearby and up to 20 000 litres of water per second thunders through. The water is about 2 degrees also, so freezing standing there in the spray! The sheer volume of water, spray and sound is amazing as you stand literally right next to it on the viewing platform in various different areas inside the mountain. Amazing!
 
Chicken, Cheese Fondue, Pork Roast, Chicken, Cheese Fondue, Pork Roast, Chicken, Cheese Fondue, Pork

2010-08-12 to 2010-08-16

So, here is my life! Each group arrives for 2 days and we do all their food for them whilst they are here in the campsite in the big white marquee that is our Topdeck cooktent. If anyone remembers my blog from March/April, this is one of the cooktents I helped to set up around Europe at the start of the season!



Our menu here is-

Dinner number one on arrival night - Chicken with a creamy white wine and mushroom sauce, potato rosti ( a traditional Swiss dish of grated potato), Broccoli, corn on the cob, followed by apple strudel, custard and berries

Hot breakfast – Fried mushies and scrambled eggs, with continental

Packed lunch – Fresh sandwiches with fruit, snacks, popper etc

Dinner number two – Traditional Swiss cheese fondue with bread, then a herbed pork roast with fennel, red onion, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon, gravy, garlic country roasted potatoes, baked zucchini and peas.

Cold Breakfast – continental with fresh fruit and yoghurt

Picnic lunch – Beef and bean burritos with all the trimmings.



Oh and dishes! I have never seen so many in all my life!! We set the tables for the passengers using nice dinner sets and serve the food onto platters to take to their tables. So dishes galore!!!!! Plus on fondue night it is my worst nightmare having to try and get that cheese off the pot and then off all the fondue sets. Not fun at all! Even worse than chopping onions and cleaning baked on lasagne pans in Rome last year!!



Somewhere in between this, we go shopping in our site car to the nearest big town. It is quite a cool supermarket – it has everything and we load up the trolleys and then just leave them at the checkout whilst they scan everything and we sit in the little cafe and have a free tea or coffee! We have several trolleys and once they begin to come through we take them out to the car and begin packing before we have even paid! Imagine if I tried that in Paris! I would be shot and killed!! But the people are so sweet here, they recognise us, and everyone is super friendly and says hi! The shopping is quite fun – the packing is not! We have to somehow fit enough food for several groups’ meals into the back of our little site vehicle. And so we play the tetris game I have become quite good at in this job. Boxes first, and then we fill heavy, heavy crates and somehow jam it all in the back, slam the doors closed, drive to the next supermarket to pick up anything we couldn’t get, and make it back to camp with the rear of the car almost dragging along the road! And then the super fun starts! We have to carry the ridiculously heavy crates into the cooktent and try and jam all the food into the fridges/freezers/pantry. And after starting at the cooktent at 0630h, we have hit already 1300h go go go go go!



In between we also have to do all the cleaning jobs for the kitchen, dining area and cooktent. As the weather can sometimes be super rainy and humid, condensation gathers so badly on the cooktent that it literally starts raining on you indoors. When it gets to that point, there is nothing you can do, but go around with a broom handle and whack each section of the roof as the condensation pours down on you, saturates everything and you begin the process of mopping it up!! Quite funny to watch actually!!



Another day we had to move the kitchen out to properly clean the lino floor of the mould that starts growing. This was an epic mission in itself as Shelley and I attempted to lift ridiculous heavy items. But, even after spending several hours away shopping the floor was not dry and so we donned tea towels on our feet and did our chores coasting across the floor on our tea towel shoes to try and dry it all out!!



So yep, we are kinda busy! But it is sooooooooooooooo nice to be actually in one place after spending the last 5 months on the road. At first I was disappointed I didn’t have another trip, but then realised this was a blessing in disguise. On site you still get paid whilst seeing all your friends on the crew come through, you get the opportunity to begin the de-ageing process after 5 months on the road! Eat better, time to do exercise, catch up on admin...and.... most importantly after spending a good 2 months out of it last year with the Swine flu after being so run down.......the opportunity to sleep!!! Yay!! So fingers crossed this season will end with not only a removal of those massive bags under the eyes caused by an amazing season on the road, but also stop me getting sick from being so run down!!! Double yay!!!!!
 
Road Trip!! 3 days of driving-but we can tick San Marino off the list! San Marino,&amp;Florence;, Italy

2010-08-17 to 2010-08-19

So, there was a cancelled tour and 2 days off in a row!!! Woohoo!! We rushed around at breakfast doing everything we needed to do, completed the shopping and then...road trip baby!!! That is the most amazing thing about living and working in Europe, within a day you can be 3 countries away from where you originally started! And so easily!!





My co worker Shelley had wanted to go to Italy and I had wanted to go somewhere new, when our friend Star Wars Rob suggested San Marino! In fact I have to say that I had never even heard of it! But as it turns out, it is a country unto itself, one of Europe’s micro states and the world’s third smallest country – we believe! Just 61km2 and 30 000 people, entirely surrounded by Italy. Perfect!!!!



And so we jumped into the car and began our marathon drive, back from the beautiful Swiss roads onto crazy toads full of crazy Italian drivers. We passed an amazing lookout over the stunning alps, Brunig pass at 1007m which was the inspiration for James Bond 007 and then stopped at the Autogrill, the famous Italian motorway stops full of amazing delicious fresh food and everything you can think of in their service station supermarket and couldn’t stop smiling! I don’t know what it is about heading to Italy, but it always just makes you feel happy and excited!!!



Our destination for the night was Florence, which was the closest main city to San Marino, and also where our company uses an amazing campsite in the Tuscan Hills that we were going to stay at. Wow it was a long drive though! About 8 hours after we began we were thankfully pulling in, getting a room, walking around the MASIVE campsite (it is bigger than Camping Roma – like maybe 10 000 people at a guess????), right up to the top pool, bar, restaurants and tennis courts to see the gorgeous views over the Tuscan hills and back down into the man camp for a delicious dinner at one of the restaurants there. Ahhh and so happy!!!

The next morning we hit the road again – San Marino!!! We started by heading to the gorgeous medieval walled city of Arezzo, situated on a hilltop overlooking the Tuscan Hills and olive groves. and then to Anghiari. The city is situated midpoint on a crazy track through the hills and is probably the most picture perfect city I have seen with windy little cobble stoned streets, sunflowers, vines, beautifully kept houses, shops and little squares. It was stunning!

What started as an amazing adventure started to get a little old as we attempted to navigate the roads. Unfortunately there was no highway the direction we were heading to San Marino so we were on little windy roads through all the hills. Fun for the first 10 mins, then definitely no fun at all for the next few hours!! We were a little over it as we finally saw our first peak of the beautiful old UNESCO world heritage city on top of Mount Titano in the Central Apennine Mountains! Stunning!! Unfortunately every man and his dog also wanted to see San Marino as well so we did several laps looking for a park before we finally managed to get one right at the very bottom of the hill and caught a few lifts up and walked the remainder of the way.





And yep, everything we expected and more!! Stunning!!! Unfortunately there were maybe a trillion people there that was a little frustrating, but I guess that is what you get on the tourist trail in Europe in Summer!!



As we entered through the gate into the walled city there was a cool little UNESCO plaque explaining the significance of San Marino as one of the oldest representative democracies based on civil autonomy and self governance with uninterrupted continuity in the world!! There were narrow little alleyways winding up the hill with cute little shops on either side. Everything was well looked after and all beautiful old carvings and house designs. We had an amazing lunch at a restaurant on the side of the mountain, overlooking the crazy Italian countryside we had just spent the last few hours driving through and we walked around the main square and churches before we decided we couldn’t put off that return journey any longer!!

And so we begun our crazy return journey over the Apennines... taking the ‘highway’ main route that was extra kilometres in the hope that it was an easier and faster drive... but nope! It was the same slow, narrow windy roads that were sending us mental! Luckily after a few hours we hit the real highway again and we have never been happier!! It was another very long drive day though, about 8 hours again, and we were then set to do it all again tomorrow to return home to Lauterbrunnen!!



And we had a dinner to cook that night so we were up early and as soon as we could check out we hit the road. And I attempted my first driving in the first time in who knows how long, on the wrong side of the road, in a crappy crappy car on an Italian highway!! Yes, crazy!!!!!!! It was fun at first, until random drivers tried to run me off the road, tailgated, undertook and any other annoying driving habit you can think of ! Then a little over it and happily handed back the wheel!! It wasn’t too bad a going until we hit the Gotthard tunnel (the worlds third longest road tunnel) where there was a MASSIVE traffic jam. There was a huge pile up in the tunnel several years ago and dozens of people died, so now the traffic is regulated by a light so only a certain number of cars can be in the tunnel at any one time as it is only one lane and if anything happens you wouldn’t know it until you were right on top of it, and then there would be no way for any emergency vehicles to get through.



We sat in the traffic for almost an hour before we managed to sneak our way up and get a green light through. And then home James! It was funny as we rounded the corner and got our first glimpse of the Jungfrau, Eiger and Monch peaks that frame the valley it really felt like we were coming home! A feeling that I haven’t had for such a long time being on the road and not having a home. And crawling into bed that night, nothing felt better!! Ahh, nice to be back!



But for now it was straight to the cooktent! We had made it just in time! We quickly ran about preparing the dinner, cooking and getting it into the oven before we could stop and have a time out. We had made it! Super exhausted, but glad we gotten to see the gorgeous San Marino and tick another country off our lists. And it was country number 59 for me! I can hardly believe that is my tally! It seemed like only a few days ago I was just hitting 20. Wow hey!!!
 
Life and adventures in the Swiss Alps, Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland

2010-08-20 to 2010-09-04

Life flies by in Lauters! By the time all the cooking, cleaning and dishes are done, the socialising with crew and some sleep another week is over before I know it!





One thing that makes me laugh everyday though is the cleaning lady. I have no idea what it is, but whatever time you want to have a shower she has closed them off and is in there cleaning. 1030am? Midday!! Yup! 3pm? Yup! 4:14? There she is!! It is ridiculous!! I have absolutely no idea how she manages to do it! Maybe it is on purpose! Maybe she waits until she sees us walk up to our rooms to get our toiletries and then laughs as she places the sign out. Who knows!! But it is crazy!





And the rain!! I am not sure what happened to summer? But I think the entire time I have been here so far we have had only like 5 days that it hasn’t rained on us at some point!! And gosh this place is cold when the clouds come in! Brrr! Like thermals, and 3 layers over the top. SO cold! NASTY!





We also think that there is something in the caravans that give you the craziest dreams. Magic mushrooms some say, mould others say. Whatever it is, I was glad to be leaving it behind and heading off to summer in Camping Roma! One of the girls I was working with MJ, and I both had a similar warped dream one night where she cut my hair off, and so we decided it was an omen. And she chopped it all off :-) So now I have nice short hair!



We have also been up to a lot of adventures!!



Our first adventure - The Läger Loop – The sun started to shine its rays out from under the clouds and so we quickly finished our shopping and headed out on an expedition!! Pinky, Shelley and I drove down to Stechelberg at the end of the valley and began our hike to the waterfall we see every day out the window of our cooktent!





We had to laugh as we set off in our random singlet, joggers, converse, canvas bags and lacking any type of proper equipment as we watched the locals look at us in amazement compared to them looking like a hiking advert!





We checked the tourist info map and were off! Luckily the Swiss are very clever people and our whole route was clearly signposted with times and distances and maps!! Just perfect for the under prepared tourist!!! As we walked we had never seen anything prettier – waterfalls, hills, rivers, views, mountains, you name it, it was there!! STUNNING!!!! Maybe THE most beautiful place in the world!!! We arrived at Trachsellauene in high spirits and began the next part of our hike. And it became a bit more difficult! It became steeper and a bit muddier and slipperier, but it was no deterrent as we climbed hundreds of stairs and came across the most amazing views. We had a pit stop at Holdrifälle waterfall, the breeze from the glacier water refreshing us until we passed some other hikers eating something from the ground....BLUEBERRIES!!!!!!!!! We ran up the trail until we found a massive patch and gorged ourselves! So delicious!!!! With purple stained hands and faces we continued our path super content! And then we were there! The waterfall at the top of the valley!!! Schmadribachfall!!! We sat and ate our lunch on a rock marvelling at the beauty around us before we had to hit the road again. We continued on the loop and within minutes had come across those bright red toadstools with white spots on them!!! Yes, the ones in books you always thought were make believe!!! They exist!!!! It was many a stair down to return to where we started the loop, past Talbachfall and then back to the start. AMAZING day! About 5 hours all up, back to shower, change and into the cooktent to prepare dinner!!!!!!!!







Our next adventure was the tunnel! The campsite, and the whole of Lauterbrunnen have little glacial rivers flowing through it, in which the locals place their beer to cool. The one at our campsite goes under the road in a little tunnel. Each year, Royal Marines come across to do arctic training and whilst staying at the campsite swim this tunnel. And so we decided to also! One by one we stepped into the freezing water and ducked down. And proceeded to loose feeling in all our limbs! It is light the whole way and you can see the end, and the water is only less than knee deep and not very fast flowing, but it is SO cold! Just before you pop out the other end you have to duck under a pipe that is in your way. WOW! Talk about cold!!! The only consolation is that when you get out the freezing cold ait actually feels good! It takes a while to get circulation back into your body, but gosh it finally feels good! Not so good the next day when we discovered massive bruises on all our knees and elbows from the rocks on the river bed, but we didn’t feel a thing at the time it was so cold!







The next adventure I took was hiking to Murren! A girl who had done my Scandinavian trip as a passenger was passing through and so we decided to meet up and go for a hike. Somehow we managed to pick THE craziest route up the side of the mountain! It was a goat trail that consisted of cutbacks to try and counteract the steepness. Try! It was epic going up, but still crazy fun. We finally made it up to the top and opted to take the actual road or a trail instead of a track next time!!! We walked along enjoying the amazing views of the Lauterbrunnen Valley and almost being what felt like eye level to the station on Jungfrau Joch, the highest accessible mountain in Europe. We walked down to Murren, a cool little car free 2 street town on the top of the mountains, and then down to Gimmelwald (Altitude 4500 ft!). So the saying goes - &quot;If Heaven isn&apos;t what it&apos;s cracked up to be, send me back to Gimmelwald.&quot; It is beautiful. A sleepy mountain village of about 130 people. No cars, no TV, no newspapers, not even a food store, but many cows and plenty of cheese. The only way to get there is by hiking or taking a cable car. We sat down and ate our lunch on picnic seats over looking the valley and mountains. Amazing. And totally free. Brilliant. And then hiked down back to Lauterbrunnen! Another epic hike – 7 hours all up I think...but Amazing!!!!!





I also hiked up to Murren another time, via a different track, which somehow was even steeper! I then decided that when climbing up the side of the mountain everything is steep! I guess that is why everyone else took the cablecar! It was awesome though!!





And our final adventure in the beautiful Swiss Alps... The lake in the mountains at Bachalpsee. MJ, Shelley and I drove out to the pretty little town of Grindelwald and caught the cablecar up to the town of First, high up in the mountains. And there was snow!!! Yup, August, yup, summer and yup, snow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In no time at all though we were warm as we hiked up and down the hills towards our destination. It was quite funny – the track was like a highway with the amount of people hiking along it!





And we arrived! It was beautiful, several clear lakes reflecting the gorgeous snow capped peaks around them here in stunning Bachalpsee. We sat down and had an amazing picnic just staring at the stunning view around us. We decided to walk all the way back down to Grindelwald instead of catching the cablecar. The track was hilarious! Muddy, across fields, stepping on stones to cross creeks, past random cows! Awesome! It was several hours of a long long downhill to get to the bottom though and our knees were screaming out in agony for us to finish! But amazing! Another picture perfect and unbeatable day hiking in the Swiss Alps!!! Oh.. and we are getting paid to be there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It couldn’t get any better! :-)
 
A full circle – back to where it all began in Camping Roma, Italy

2010-09-05 to 2010-09-09

After an epic 9 hour overland journey from Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland I arrived! I had left my cabin at 6am to be driven to the station, and caught my first train. I had 4 minutes to get to the right platform with all my stuff and transfer trains for the next leg of my journey – I pulled up at platform 1 and the next train left from platform 8! Sitting on the train waiting for the next transfer I was pumped and ready to find the information boards and run – I had about 20 mins, but I had no idea how far I had to go! And it turned out about 3 paces to the other side of the track! And finally another transfer, down from platform 1 to platform 15 in 5 mins after the train was late, but surprisingly all went according to plan! I arrived into the beautiful Italian sunshine and joined the epic queue that is the wait for the bus to the campsite. And Hello Sunshine, Hello Camping Roma!



And so I arrived to the campsite, the site where it all began - a full cycle to where I first started working for Topdeck 18 months ago. It was amazing to be in the Italian sunshine and have the staff smile and wave as they remembered me! So nice!



It was so random I was given Rome to finish as well as it is one of the places in Europe that I was disappointed that I hadn’t had enough time in to be able to see everything that I wanted to!



So, it was a quick dip into the pool and straight into the kitchen to cook dinner for 2 groups in that night. There were 3 of us in the kitchen, and Boobs said not to worry about getting up for breakfast the next morning as it was a cold one. I was feeling a cold coming on so went to bed early. The next morning when the alarm went off I felt like crap and so texted to say I would stay in bed. Boobs and Timmy had both stayed up drinking with the crew and Boobs had told Timmy to sleep in as well... but neither of them heard the alarm go off and no one turned up to breakfast!!!! Luckily we had set up the night before and they all managed to make do. When we all finally emerged about five hours later I was in the cooktent when one of the drivers came in and asked to pick up the lunch. ‘Lunch?’ ‘Didn’t you get that at breakfast??’ I asked, and the reply was,’ um there was no one here!!!’ And I fell on the floor laughing! So out of 3 cooks, none of us had managed to make it to breakfast!!!! Hilarious!! I rummaged through the fridges and shed and put together their lunch as Boobs and Timmy both rocked up, we all looked at each other and pissed ourselves laughing!!! Good start!!! It doesn’t happen ever so pretty darn funny that it did to us!



And then a spot of cleaning and................ we had 3 days off!! Yay!!!!The boys left for Beerfest and I met Naomi, my new counterpart and headed straight out to see my Aunty Lyn, Uncle Eduardo and cousin Viviana who live just several metro stops away from the campsite! Yay for some normality for a few days!!! :-)
 
My own room, the Catholic Churches gold and farewell life on the road with Topdeck! Roma, Italy

2010-09-10 to 2010-09-22

It was so nice being back in Rome – sunshine, my own room! Sunshine! My own room!! Free hot showers!!! A real bed!! An ensuite!! Yup, an ensuite!! And cheap!!!! You could actually afford to buy a snack on the street without taking out a second mortgage! And the food is sooooooooooooooooooooo good. I am not sure what it is about Italian food, but it is simply amazing! The produce is so fresh, the flavours so amazing and everything just so delicious!!!! SO good!!!



I spent a few days with my Aunty Lyn, Uncle Eduardo and Cousin Viviana whilst I was here and it was heaps of fun to be in their kitchen and learn different types of Italian cooking methods and using different foods that were all amazingly delicious. We had an awesome time zipping around the city on their motorscooters (nope, not me riding!), heading up Gianicolo , a hill to see the sights over the beautiful city of Roma, through the busy Roman streets, past all the world famous sites and then walking through various Piazza’s to see the markets and then to this amazing optical illusion that looks like a normal long walkway with a large statue at the end, but it is really just about 8 steps long and the statue is about thigh high! The columns are made smaller and put inwards and angled and tricks your eye to look really real!!! Palazzo Spada it is called.



And then continuing the same theme we headed to this other awesome church St. Ignazio di Loyola near the Pantheon that as you walk in and look up, the painted ceiling seems to come alive to you and really looks 3D! As you continue down towards the altar you see a dome in the ceiling. As you walk past it and look backwards, you realise that it is just a painted circle and not a dome at all! It is a Jesuit church and where the commoners sat was the back so it looked like an amazing dome, but from where the priests sat at the front of the church they knew it was not, like once you became educated by the church you could know the truth! It also had a few other cool little designs, such as the red shirt trailing down out of a painted wall in plaster and as you placed your hand to block the sun at the window above the entrance, to the right hand side was a figure doing exactly that you would not see before because of the glare! Pretty cool hey!! And it is a Baroque church – like 500 years old!!!!



We did heaps! Also out to the Olympic park (Stadio dei Marmi -Marmi meaning marble) from when Rome hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960 where the field is surrounded by these amazing huge sculptures depicting all major cities in Italy and all sorts of sporting disciplines. The track is open so locals were all just coming down and training there! So cool!



We also went to the beautiful Piazza Navona which I really like with the Fountain of the Four Rivers, depicting the four main rivers in the world and some cool churches that we always turn up too late to get inside!!! And then...inside St Peters Basilica!!! (Saint Peter is one of the apostles of Jesus, first bishop of Rome, first in line to Papal succession and believed to be buried underneath) Although I had been to Rome so many times and spent quite a long period of time here, I had somehow managed never to go inside!!! And so Aunty Lyn got me there! It was again a long queue, but moved very fast and stepping inside I was AMAZED. It is unbelievably beautiful. It looks MASSIVE and as far as you can see with its high, high ceilings there are ornate sculptures, paintings, marble, gold, gold, gold, gold and you name it, it is there!! Even the ceilings, walls, floor everywhere, not a single millimetre has been missed. Michaelangelos famous Pieta statue of Mary and Jesus after the crucifixion is here, there are also many tombs in the Basilica and several Popes lying there inside glass.



Outside St Peters Piazza, was designed so the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing and it is HUGE! In the walkway around the sides, there are three columns in each line, but if you stand on one spot to the right and left of the centre obelisk, all the columns in each line, line up perfectly and combine into one! It is awesome!



In Rome I also had the opportunity to walk from the stunning matching churches at Piazza del Popolo down the main street Via Dell Corso, admiring the gorgeous city to end up at the Basilica of St Peter in Chains where there is a sculpture of Moses by Michaelangelo with devil horns instead of a halo. Moses is depicted with horns, connoting &quot;the radiance of the Lord&quot;, due to the similarity in the Hebrew words for &quot;beams of light&quot; and &quot;horns&quot;. This kind of iconographic symbolism was common in early sacred art, and for an artist horns are easier to sculpt than rays of light. There are also these awesome sculptures of skeletons with wings and machete’s that are simply amazing!!!



Another day we managed to escape and head into town for a bit and so joined the queue outside St Peters Basilica to go up the dome, or cupola as it is called. On the way Pete Murray and I had to find an appropriate outfit for Sara to wear as you need to ensure that your shoulders and knees are covered and she didn’t own anything that wasn’t going to be too hot to wear all day. She wasn’t happy with any of the outfits from the gypsy markets until we stumbled across a store selling massive coat like dresses that looked like a cross somewhere between lab coats, vampire outfits and graduation dresses! We found a delightful bright red and black number that looked like she was graduating from Vampire school and headed on it! The strangest thing is no one even batted an eyelid!

There were hundreds of people in the queue in the sun, but it moved fairly fast. Pete Murray told us our random fact for the day that apparently there is enough gold in the Vatican to remove the entire population of India from poverty! Ridiculous wealth!



At the front we selected the stair option and began our ascent! Luckily most people took the elevator so it wasn’t too crowded!! I think it was something like 550 each way so not too bad. It was amazing as we came out on the first opening and found ourselves looking down on the inside of St Peters basilica from the inside of the very high ceilings.



It is stunning from ground level, but it was amazing from the birds eye view. Continuing up we had a close up of the beautiful statues on top of the first part of the basilica and then the stairways became narrower, more windy and as we entered the dome, we had to walk on a crazy crazy angle! I was surprised that there were not more warning signs warning of this at the bottom as fat, unfit or claustrophobic people would not have made it through at all...and there is no way out except up!!!!



It was stifling hot and so we practically burst through the ‘doors’ as we arrived at the top... but then went nowhere! The hundreds of people that were in the queue with us down the bottom were all here in this tiny confined space all trying to see out over the city!!! Hilarious!!! We finally got through to the edge and saw the stunning views over the Vatican city grounds!! So green, well manicured and beautiful buildings and fountains!!, St Peters Square and pretty much as far as the eye can see! We picked out some famous other landmarks before we decided we really wanted to descend!! Unfortunately once this decision was made we joined the throng of people trying to get down the one narrow stairway!!! Not fun!!! But finally we made it down and straight into the openness of the basilica! Thank goodness!



Walking along taking in the gorgeous sights, we headed to Castel Saint Angelo, but unfortunately it was closed on Mondays and so continued on to the one of my favourite little neighbourhoods in Rome – Trastevere. We walked around the quaint little streets until we settled on a little restaurant and had a delicious lunch, before cocktails and then seeing some sights by night. Rome is simply beautiful!!!



It was busy at work, but we made the most of our time! It was again awesome to see all the road crew, at times we had 3 groups in, so almost 150 people at each sitting for the meals, but we had a bit of time off in the middle of each day so we could catch up life, washing and on the sleep deprivation that sets in after a seasons end!



And then... it was over! As I wave goodbye to Camping Roma, two unbelievably epic years on the road come to an end. Thankyou for the experience of a lifetime, but most of all, thankyou to all the amazing people I have had the pleasure to work with and meet, for the opportunities I have been given, things I have seen and knowledge I have gained. Thankyou especially to a random girl who I met in a London pub one night who turned out to be the Topdeck Crew Manager and took a chance on hiring a totally unqualified backpacker and sending her out on the road the next week. :-)



I feel so lucky to have been given so many opportunities to see so much, go so many places and meet so many amazing people, but it is time to move on. I’ll never forget the memories of my time on the road. But waving goodbye I again shouldered my backpack and off onto new adventures, into the big wide world on my own.... :-)
 
Tirana - best seen from a bus window at 60km/hr... but I get to see Monty and Mick!!! Albania

2010-09-23 to 2010-09-30

My backpack has seen better days as I placed fresh gaffa tape that holds the broken zips together, but I was ready to leave my uniforms, work and begin backpacking again with my good friends Mick and Monty from home.



It&apos;s odd how they force you to lie to get into a country! I was not allowed to check in for my flight from Rome to Tirana, Albania until I had proof of an onward flight from Albania. I was going overland (and could not get the ticket beforehand), and then had a flight from Athens ten days later, clearly meaning I was leaving the country to get there and catch it.



But no, unfortunately I wasn&apos;t allowed to continue. Luckily a kindly employee sent me to the booking desk where I booked an outward flight I was never going to take, made a printout and then cancelled it before the payment. I then returned smiling to check in.



Here you go, I&apos;m flying to Rome on the 27th! I said. She laughed and accepted it, both of us clearly knowing I was never going to board that aircraft. Here is your ticket,

enjoy your stay&apos;! And to get into Albania! I havnt even had that problem in the UK... touchwood!!!! Hilarious!



Not so hilarious the flight in though as the small aircraft shuddered and weaved up and down over the mountains and completed massive banking turns very low over houses that in my professional aeronautical opinion I could see no reason for! Very very weird.



Clearly I stand out and from the moment I arrive it is &apos;madam taxi&apos;! Taxi? &apos;No bus!! you have to catch a taxi&apos;. Liars! Luckily I had done my research and stoicly stood there in the barrage for 45 mins awaiting the bus. I couldn&apos;t wait to see what the roads were like

after that amazing flight!!!!!



Unfortunately aircon had yet to reach Tirana as we sat there in the sweltering heat on our bumpy potholed journey into town listening as the gearbox ground at every gear change.



Still the airport was exceptionally clean, toilets included and the guy in the money exchange was not only super nice, but also spoke English! Bring on Albania!



The bus randomly dropped me off at the side of the road somewhere and I attempted to figure out where I was and where I was going! There are no bus terminals in Albania and all the buses depart from a pre-determined spot that is apparently easy to find... apparently!! There is also really not much at all in Tirana and so we had arranged to meet at the Tirana International Hotel.



I walked past pizzeria, travel agency, pizzeria, travel agency, yup, all there was in Tirana! I am not sure about the Italian influence either?? Italy is so far away!



And then there were people waving!!! My good friends Monty and Mick had also made it alive!!! I had been so excited about seeing Monty again - the last time having been Villers-Bretennoux for ANZAC day (which brings a pretty cool tally to the places we have met up!!! Dili - East Timor, Sydney, Huntingdon - USA, Amiens and Villers-Bretennoux France and now Tirana!).



So, if you cant join them, beat them! We settled in for a giant pizza lunch that in the local currency (leke) cost the equivalent of about 6 euro for all of us! Um about 8 Aussie dollars. Amazing for Europe!!! So cheap!



The Albanians also have an odd way of parking. Instead of parking right in the lane right next to the curb, they park in the lane second in. I was like &apos;what the?!&apos; at first, but then thinking about it I guess it is kind of smart as that way you can still pull into the curb and turn and everything. Just SO odd to see cars literally parked in the middle of the road!



And there was free wifi everywhere! Literally everywhere you went! For such a developing nation it was very very odd. But so handy! The main area of town- Skanderbeg Square - was all but gone except for a dude on a horse statue as they were rebuilding everything. We had a couple of hours to kill before getting on our bus to Prizren, Kosovo and spent it wandering the streets, checking out the not-so-many-sights-to-see here... And then 2 minutes later we just pulled up and waited on the street for our bus! In their defence, the Albanians are all quite friendly, but really, as Mick would put it - the place is a &apos;shithole&apos;! :-)
 
NATO forces and Spray on pants - The amazing Prizren, Kosovo - updated

2010-09-24 to 2010-09-26

We stood randomly at the side of the road waiting for our bus to take us from Tirana, Albania, to Prizren, Kosovo. Kosovo is a part of the former Yugoslavia and again so interesting to me seeing it all in the news when I was growing up. There is still a lot of trouble though, particularly to the north at the border with Serbia and 27 nations contribute troops to the NATO mission there. And it is the world’s newest country - so that is quite exciting to be able to visit it.



We had been told about the new highway that had just been built from Tirana to Kosovo through the mountains so we were quite excited about the journey. But unfortunately the highway was only half done and so the windy, windy steep dirt roads through the mountains began! Not nice! Windy windy dirt roads with massive potholes and big drops of the side! Fun times!



It was strange too that all the locals all squished up to the front of the bus as well, but nice cause it meant that there were spare seats for us to sit together!



Along the way we had one service stop whilst we waited for the green light for us to enter a tunnel. There were makeshift stalls at the side of the road and random dirty port-a-loos just sitting on the edge of the cliffs!! A local Albanian also decided he wanted to take me for his wife after finding out I was Australian! But luckily we escaped and we were back on the ‘road’ again!



As we headed to the Albanian/Kosovo border the bus company rep came up the bus and collected just the passports from Monty, Mick and I, no one else on the bus (they were all local). We sat on the bus as they were taken inside. Next thing we knew the bus was starting and we were driving away as we looked at each other in horror and Mick started to sprint down the bus. But they had been dropped off and the rep looked up smiling as he handed them back. Phew! Imagine losing your passport at that border in the middle of nowhere!!! Nasty!!!



We then stopped 10 mins from the border and with no one speaking English we tried to figure out what was going on! Dinner break apparently as the rep pointed at numbers on Mick’s watch indicating to us we would have 20 minutes there! We asked for something that someone else was eating by pointing and sat down to scoff it down in about 4 minutes before the bus left again! We attempted to ask for the bill, but received tomato sauce instead! Handy!! And so went inside to pay – 2 euros each for meat and salad!!! Bargain!!!



Arriving into Prizren in the dark we were again just dropped randomly on the side of the main road we drove in on, next to an empty dirt lot and a 5.2% advertisement billboard. No idea where we were, we shouldered our backpacks and began to figure out where to go when a random taxi arrived. Convenient! :-) Unfortunately he had no idea where our hotel was and had to flag down a passing police car to ask for directions! Only in Kosovo!!



He attempted to dupe us, but we got him in the end and only paid half of what he wanted. Monty had done well with the accommodation – a little guesthouse (Oltas Pension) just a street away from the gorgeous old town! We had a walk around and there were people everywhere! And they were all so curious to see us and all so friendly smiling and saying hello – but not in that annoying I want you to buy something or sleazy way, but just genuinely interested and friendly! It was so nice, and also amazingly nice to be the only Australians and the only tourists in the area!



Getting up early we were pleasantly surprised by the delicious breakfast served up by our friendly guesthouse and we hiked up to the Kaljaja fortress on a massive hill overlooking the entire town. We even made friends, sort of, with a bunch of local boys who sat in the background of one of our photos posing and yelling out &quot;facebook, facebook&quot; until after the photo was taken, when they proceeded to run away! We made it up to the Kalaja and it was a beautiful view of the city. It looked like Prizren was such a sprawling city instead of the tiny town we thought it was, but apparently has 70,000 inhabitants.



We wandered around the old town and into the new town, and had a really nice traditional Kosovarian lunch, consisting of puffed up bread to start, followed by delicious seasoned meat and salads and then oranges to end! I asked our super friendly waiter what we should do in Prizren and he declined to answer, saying instead he finished work at 3 and he would take us on a guided tour. Unfortunately we had to stake out the bus for the next morning! We walked towards to the bus station because the bus co-driver that morning, when asked &apos;bus, Tirana, here?’ when they dropped off in the middle of nowhere replied ‘yes’ here! .......On the side of the street going the wrong direction to Tirana.... helpful!!!!



But after seeing the bus station on the taxi ride the night before, we decided to see if the bus left from the bus station or the random road. No one spoke English but we knew our bus company had another bus leaving at 1600 (weneeded the 0530 bus to make our connection to Athens). And so we waited at a corner that gave us a view of both the bus station and the random place we had been dropped. After about 30min and no bus, Monty and I headed to the bus station to try and communicate. We found out other companies had buses leaving at 0630 and 0700 the next morning and in the mean time Mick had seen our bus company pass by the place we expected before heading in the direction of the bus station. Sweet! Soooooooo in theory we should be right!





We continued walking and also saw the City Hall building which had written in massive fonts across it thank you to about 100 different countries in their native languages, including a ‘thanks Australia.’ We later found out that these were the countries that had formally recognised Kosovos independence. Oh and an even funnier thing is that we constantly saw military vehicles of various countries driving around, and as we were attempting to walk and find the bus station, with absolutely no idea where we were (actually later finding out we were on the wrong road!!) one of the Kosovo Task Force vehicles stopped and asked US for directions! Too funny! We weren’t sure if it was a compliment that we looked like locals (when clearly we do not!!!) or what! We couldn’t stop laughing about it though!! :-)



The trend in Kosovo at the moment also appears to be spray on pants. Every single girl we saw had some form of super super tight pants on whether they were jeans, tights, or anything else you can think of! Weird!



Later that night we chose a nice traditional looking restaurant for dinner and again had an amazing waiter give us all a massive history lesson on Kosovo that we really enjoyed as there are no museums or anything explaining what had happened!





The things that hit us the most were since transferring to the Euro, the Kosovarians have really struggled and the economy has been really bad. In addition, the borders to Kosovo will be opened next year to the rest of the European Union and it is anticipated that 50% of the youths will leave the country as there is nothing for them there, and not enough money for them to be able to move themselves forward in life. So sad for the future of the country though!



But I guess there is not that much they can do with the corruption in government that we were told about. All the money is going straight into the pockets of the government and the citizens are really struggling. So sad to hear him, after they fought so hard for their independence as well.



On the way back to the hostel we stopped off at a little store selling fresh ice cream. We had spoken to the owner earlier in the day and he was so lovely that we had promised we would come and get a scoop later. It was beautiful ice cream. And for 30 euro cents. That’s all. And we were the only customers we had seen in there all day.



It is just so amazing to look at all the locals, they are all so friendly and so happy and yet they have nothing at all and have had such tough lives. It really puts everything into perspective and makes you wonder about all the people elsewhere who are so unhappy and have everything that they have in their lives. I just hope that their economy and government gets sorted out and they have something to look forward to as they really deserve it after struggling for so long and still being so happy in their lives and what they have. So amazing. It is certainly an amazing country, Kosovo, so beautiful, so friendly , so much history, so cheap and so much to offer and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.



And then it was time to attempt to get a few hours sleep before the MEGA journey we were not looking forward to at all tomorrow... 25 hours... Kosovo to Greece via Albania!!!!!
 
25 h delight-Kosovo to Greece overland-via Tirana. Yup, Albanian roads..we made it out alive!UPDATE

2010-09-25 to 2010-09-26

So after an amazing time in Kosovo, we were up at 0345 to make our bus! Ugh! I forgot how nasty early mornings are! We all made the couple of kilometre trek with all our worldy possessions pitifully and groggily to the bus station. We were followed by 3 random dogs, who soon became our friends and never left our side! We arrived at the random street that was apparently the pick up point 20min early...just in case! ...but found ourselves still standing there 50min later. We had just about given up hope when we saw a bus heading our way... it was our bus company and the front sign said Tirana! The bus driver looked directly at us as he swung the bus around the roundabout and headed in the opposite direction to us. Monty started yelling and running as Mick and I grabbed the bags and started attempting to run down the streets after her. Unfortunately in our haste we followed the bus in an entire loop around the bus station and missed it as it came out the other side!!! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!





We soon had a gaggle of taxi drivers trying to convince us that there were no more buses and that we should take their taxi.s We had offers of 50 euro to chase down the bus, and others of between 40 and 4000 euros for the entire trip to Tirana!! Given that it is at least a 3.5h journey, we just laughed!!!. Due to our research we knew there was another bus at 0630, and so hung out by another random section of road, watched the sun rise and actually had to thank the taxi drivers in the end as they flagged the next bus, yelled at us to come, and as we grabbed our bags and hoofed it around the corner they loaded them on and waved us off!!! It was actually a nicer bus too so all worked out in the end as we had heaps of room and settled down to snooze, only be be woken periodically as we bumped over dirt roads, potholes and I made the mistake of looking out the window as we sat at the very edge of the cliff looking straight down into the valley below!!!! Back to eyes closed til it was over!!!! :-)





Arriving back into Tirana, Albania the weather was crap and it proceeded to piss down with rain all day so we found the only non pizza shop we could find for brunch.... crepes! And then with the attractions of Tirana exhausted, we hung out in the lobby of the Tirana International Hotel all day before walking random circles of town to get our blood moving before we begun the epic 17 hour journey to Athens!!



For some reason unknown to us, the locals all squished up the front again so we had a bit of space to ourselves... until more people got on damn it!!! and the last seats we taped off with sticky tape so no one could access them! Weird! It started off fun as we played some games and chatted away, but with no air con the situation quickly deteriorated with the bus full of smelly Albanians who have obviously never heard of deodorant!!!!



We were still in high spirits as we arrived at the Albanian/Greece border.... until the computer system crashed (and it’s one of the stricter boarders due as apparently the Albanians have a tendency to try and cross over illegally). And we stood waiting to be processed. Then no idea what happened as we got on the bus and tried to sleep, but we were still there 4 hours later!!!!! Not to mention it the pouring rain, and crazy wind in near blizzard conditions with the bus bumping up and down with massive pot holes, no guard railings, and travelling about 20km/hr on the very very dodgy dirt roads all the way until the Greece border. Even though it was 2am and pitch black and most of the bus were trying to sleep there were still some lovely fellow passengers who insisted on talking extremely loudly at each other all night, like I cant sleep so no one else can!!!!



My favourite part is a toss up though, perhaps it was the state of the squat toilets or port a loss at some of our service stops – the bus didn’t have toilets and we spoke no Albanian, so had no idea when stops were coming up and so were usually busting by the time we got there! Or......the guy who was sitting directly behind Monty and Mick who spent pretty much the entire trip vomiting and making the gagging noise that made us want to hurl ourselves!!!!



I was across from Monty and Mick and made the mistake of looking of the first time he vomited... the occasion when he managed to get it all over his shirt and chunks of it on the floor. Oh wow. SO gross!!!! I had to sit there most of the journey with my hand at the side of my face so I wouldn’t have to inadvertently witness it any longer!!! His father next to him had the delightful job of swinging the plastic bag full of vomit as he walked down the aisle to let the bus driver know he needed to pull over. He would then swing the bag as he walked back to the door right in front of me (and yes, you could see and hear it sloshing!!!!), before turfing it out the door. Usually the bus was still in motion!!! In the pitch black of night I just hope that there wasn’t a random out there that got covered!!!!!!!



On one of our pit stops we began talking to a nice Albanian guy who spoke English. He was impressed we were from Australia and asked how we liked his country, Albania. Ahhh!! Monty and I just looked at each other blankly. Ummmmm... ‘the roads are really bumpy ‘ was the best response I could come up with!!!! Like most Albanians he was so friendly I just couldn’t offend him with the truth!!!



So we finally arrived into Athens a few hours late at about 9am and discovered we were literally across the road from our hotel!!! (Classical Athens Imperial). We were laughing as after that bus ride we figured with the size of Athens we would be kilometres away!!!

And so... in summary.... 20km/ hr on dodgy, dodgy potholed and dirt roads, massive drops off the side, several hours sitting at the border at midnight, people vomiting constantly behind us then slinging the bags out the door as we drove, no aircon, no toilet and unbelieveable BO to name a few delights.... but 25 long hours later we managed to make it out of Albania alive!



Yup, probably one of the worst bus rides I have been on! Ever! I was just glad Monty and Mick were there with me to laugh at it all!!! Awesome adventure!!! :-)
 
5 star floors, rooftop bars, frozen orange-yoghurt-cheesecake and the Olympics, Athens, Greece

2010-09-26 to 2010-09-28

After a hot shower we all felt a little more human as we met up with Monty and Mick’s friends Paul and Kylie Sidwell. As Monty and Mick had come to the end of their European leg of their tour and would be camping across the Middle East and Africa for the next few months they were spoiling themselves with a 5 star hotel... and luckily for me having the most amazing friends I had a free 5 star floor!!!!! And it was superb! :-)



We ate ourselves silly on delicious Greek yoghurt and everything you could imagine at the massive buffet breakfast before heading out into Athens to see the sights. We saw the amazing Acropolis sitting high on the hill and wandered through the markets and around the ruins in town before seeing the changing of the guards at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The soldiers also double as a presidential guard so it was a 2 in 1 sightseeing deal! Their uniforms are like none I have seen before and as Monty found out later the dress and drill movements e been carried on from 1833 which was pretty cool. It was quite funny as there was one rather large tourist who had his shirt pulled up exposing his belly, in a vain attempt to keep cool I guess! And tried to push his way in to stand right in front of the guys ....as they marched in. Stupid! I’ll have to say most of the crowd laughed as they bowled him over on their way through!!!



Heading back to the hotel Monty and Mick treated Monty and I to an awesome massage, especially needed after a few nights sleeping on random buses! And then up onto the roof to enjoy the pool and delicious cocktails at the rooftop bar with views out to the Acropolis!!! Ahh luxury!! We Ended the lovely day catching the amazingly convenient metro for just one euro a ticket!!! (so nice!) and dined with view of the ancient Greek ruins around us.



The following day Monty and I were so excited by the gym in the hotel we got up early to make use of it... and then were in pain for about the next 3 days!!! Oops! After another delightful buffet breakfast Monty, Mick and I headed off to see the Acropolis. Normally it cost €12 to get in, but for some reason, all the museums and sites are free on the last weekend in September, so everything we wanted to do was free which saved us about €40 for the day. Bargain!!!!!



After lunch we were walking down the cafe road when one of the sellers enticed us over with the offer of a free taste of her ice cream. As backpackers and never ones to refuse free food we gracefully accepted! Mick and I tried the orange and frozen yoghurt and we were hooked!! Tasting exactly like a delicious cheesecake it may have been the most amazing ice cream or frozen yoghurt we have ever tasted!!! Amazing!!! I am not ashamed to say we may have frequented that place several times during our stay!!! :-)



We walked around the city, taking it all in and then hitting upon the stadium where the first modern Olympics were held. It was actually really cool, with all the seats made from marble and so beautifully constructed. We had a race to the podium and on the track which was fun before sitting in the fancy seats reserved for all the important people. They had carved marble slabs with the history of where the Olympics have been held since the first modern Olympics was held there in Athens which was quite cool. Overall, all of us agreed, it was by far the coolest place we had seen all day! Los of fun! We finished the day with a nice traditional Greek dinner in town and a couple of night photos before an early night as once again we had another early start the next day!!!
 
Sunsets, seafood, quad bikes and just like the movies! Santorini, Greece

2010-09-28 to 2010-09-29

Up again at about 5am, at what felt like the crack of dawn we didn’t mind though as we were off to the Greek Islands!!! You know sometimes when you travel you have those super super early mornings, those nights traveling on some random mode of transport allllllll night or those days sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting for connections? well, we had somehow managed to get all of them on a constant stream back to back!! And although we were ridiculously tired we were most definitely having a blast.





We had originally planned to head to a Greek Island called Paros but due to an unworkable (for us) ferry timetable we luckily managed to find a ferry to take us to Santorini instead. We caught the super efficient metro out to the port and jumped onboard a Bluestar ferry for the day. It was a nice boat we head a heap of space so were quite content to sit there and wile away the time playing cards... for about 7 of the 8 hours! Along the way we also stopped off at two other Greek islands and the trip flew by! SO much nicer than a bus!!!!!!



We arrived into the port of the main island of Santorini, Thera at about 1530 and braved the craziness around us of people waving placards and trying to entice us to stay at their hotels!!!! It was crazy!!!! People everywhere!!!! Randomly we somehow found the local bus and jumped aboard to Fira to the guesthouse we were staying at. The directions given to us by reception after requesting these in an email were - &apos;take the local public bus and we are close to the bus station’. We laughed at the time at their distinct lack of helpfulness but it was actually quite easy as everyone we asked knew the place and we managed to find our way quite easily!



Dumping our bags, Mick took us straight to the scooter and quad bike hire shop! Actually not a bad price either for 15 euros for 24 hours!! With Mick zipping around on his scooter and and Monty and I zooming on our quad bikes it was So much fun!!! We headed up to a town in the North called Oia to see the sunset. Well, us and about a thousand of our closest friends! People were climbing everywhere to get a good position, but there was actually heaps of space and we never once felt crowded in. It was absolutely beautiful seeing the sun set over the water and all the lovely traditional Greek blue and white buildings everywhere.



We walked around the cool little windy streets and also realised that it is where the scene of ‘Sisterhood of the travelling pants is shot’. It looks exactly the same! Quite cool!



We perused some menus and found a really reasonable little cafe called Seagull. We walked down a fair few stairs to it and were astonished to find the most amazing view!!!!! Fresh and cheap seafood and stunning views over the water!!!! Amazing!!!





As the darkness set in around us, Monty and I started to freak out a little about riding our bikes home in the dark as on the way in on the main roads we were already very cautious and it was fully light then!!! As Mick put it - On the positive side we did make it home in one piece and did not cause any major accidents!!’ It took us about 40 mins to ride out in daylight and we managed to get home in about 30min so our confidence was definitely improving and we were having a blast!!





The next morning we were ready to check out the rest of the island on our amazing bikes!!! We spent just over 6 hrs riding around Santorini which turned out to be heaps bigger than any of us expected. We managed to see pretty much everything we wanted to and hit all of the main towns - Akrotiri, Perivolos, where we had a picnic lunch overlooking the water, Perissa and Kamari. They were all awesome little seaside towns with beaches ( with black sand due to the volcano literally right next to us!) and cute little cafes on them.





We had an absolute blast on the bikes! SO much fun!!! And not a single accident!!! Bonus!!!! My speedo was broken, but the others said we had even managed to hit speeds of nearly 60 km/hr which was a big improvement from about the 5 km we started on the first day!!!!





Unfortunately we had to return the bikes but had worked it out well so we would be in the capital of Fira for the night wandering around before we had to head off. We again managed to scope out another delicious good value seafood dinner with Mick and I both getting a massive plate of squid and octopus and salad and rice for 8 euro!! Mmmmmmmmm!!!!!





And then again it was time! We caught the bus down to the port and scoped out a position so we would have a good vantage point for the rush to get on the ferry and get a good sleeping spot for the night! We were on the midnight ferry and had managed to get almost to the front of the doors that would open to let us walk across the port and onto the ferry. The first door opened which was where Monty and Mick were standing so I quickly joined the crush adn barged through to race for the boat! Onboard we had sorked out our plan to head left and all raced and managed to get some couches and floor space for the night!!! Nota bad effort! We quickly laid out our sleeping bags and bunkered down for the night! It did make me laugh though – the life of a traveller! Can sleep anywhere!!!!





We were only on Santorini for just over 36hrs but every minute was worth it. The island was absolutely beautiful and we are all very glad we made the trip. We arrived into Athens about 0530am and headed to Monty and Micks hostel who luckily had the room all ready and let us check in! I was flying out that afternoon and the others the next day so we wandered around town for a bit until it was time for me to head to say good bye and head to Madrid. But the most awesome thing is that within six weeks we will be meeting up again!! This time in Nairobi!!! We were super excited and ready for our next adventure!!!
 
¡vuelva al español! Return to spanish!!! Madrid, Spain

2010-09-30 to 2010-10-03

As I arrived, so so tired I made me way down to the tube. Wow the airport was long, it took literally forever, but it gave me a good opportunity to scope out the floor space as it looked like I would need to sleep at the airport on my last night due to a really early (but cheap!) flight.



It was ridiculously efficient as I exited the (1 euro!!!) Metro and found the Hostel less than 50m away! Brilliant! ....unfortunately it seemed to be the local red light district as I walked past a good dozen prostitutes in that small space of distance! One of the other guys staying in the hostel said that one had come up to him asking in English why he didn’t want to sleep with her!!! It was the first time he had been propositioned by a prostitute and his answer was ‘I just got in and I am hungry!’ Seemed to do the trick though and she left him alone!



It was almost 2am by the time I had arrived, checked in and made my way up 8 flights of stairs and through the maze that is the random hexagonal shaped building to my room. But it was quite spacious with a comfy bed, an ensuite and ahhh home sweet home!!!



I was wondering where on earth I had booked myself looking at the prostitutes and the police everywhere until I headed out the next morning and found myself perfectly located right in the centre of the city!! Not bad at all! Metropol Equity Point Hotel if you are interested! I joined in on the free city walking tour that took us on a good loop of the city. We visited all the main places and heard the stories behind everything which was really interesting! Plaza Mayor and the Austrian area around this from the time of the Hapsburg rule, the oldest restaurant in the world – it even has the Guinness world records certificate in the window! (They serve suckling pig in case you are interested!) and the nunnery where the nuns cannot speak to anyone at all! What a way to live! It was closed for a few days, but apparently the nuns make the best biscuits in the world – you go in the special door, place your money (like 6 or 8 euro) on the turn table and the nuns turn it around behind heir wall and spin the biscuits back out to you!



We passed the Catedral de la Almudena, which has taken over a hundred years to complete and 3 different architects with different styles of building! Apparently the people of Madrid hate it and say there is nothing beautiful about it, inside or out, but I thought it was quite pretty from the front and back! The sides are just plain brick walls though.



And then to the Royal Palace which was quite beautiful also! The statues of the former Kings began to be placed on the roof, until the queen at the time had a dream that they all fell down. To please her, the King them had the remainder of them placed in a garden to the front of the palace. Recent architectural research has also shown that the weight of all the statues on the roof would have collapsed it! So lucky the King listened! The blood line of the Spanish Royal family at the time died out though due to inbreeding – the marriages of brothers and sisters and close family. The last King was so intellectually and physically disabled he never had any children.



We saw the Puerta del Sol, the sun gates which is the other main square and meeting point of the city, the main street Gran Via (which my hotel is on), the beautiful buildings everywhere and the home to celebrations of the famous soccer team Real Madrid.



I then walked up to Plaza de Espana which was stunning! There was some really cool markets there and close by an Egyptian temple, the Spanish claim is the only one not to have been stolen! And another cute little church with a brightly coloured dome.



My legs close to falling off, the next morning I hit the area to the north around Plaza dos de Mayo. My favourite area in Madrid! There were heaps of little windy streets with all sorts of random stores on them, funky artwork and mosaics on the street walls, little squares with cafe’s and an amazing atmosphere and hardly any cars. Awesome!!!



On Sunday the El Rasto markets was on and everything I had read and everyone I had spoken to about it just pulled a face and shook their heads as they spoke about the pickpockets. So although I had successfully navigated many other pickpocket havens throughout the world I was a little nervous and even more nervous as I headed into the crush of thousands and thousands of people, but success! Proud to say I emerged unscathed the other end!



The markets were amazing though – pretty much an entire maybe 6 blocks all filled with stores containing everything you could think of! It was so much fun wandering around there for a few hours before heading down to the biggest park in Madrid. Parque del Retiro I believe it is called and it has about 130 hectares! It is amazingly beautiful with many different areas, a massive massive pond where people row, sculptures, statues, flowers, trees, peacocks, market stalls, everything! It was stunning to just wander around there for a few hours as well. Beautiful!





Now what else happened??!! Well, it took me a day to figure out the water situation in the hostel – if you want a hot(ish) shower you need to have it between 7 and 8pm, and the showerhead hose is about 3cm too short to fit into the actual attachment on the wall that makes it a real shower. You have to do that juggle thing with the shower nozzle in one hand to shower. I was talking to another guy who had stayed a week and he hadn’t managed anything other than an ice cold shower the entire time!!! Ahh the joys of living in hostels!



The hostel has a weird room key system as well – there is one key for the room and so the last person out of the room locks it and leaves it at reception, and the first person back in gets it and then has to open the door for all the other people as they come in!! So bizarre!!!!!



I was quite lucky when I arrived, I just had one other nice Argentinean guy in my room, but that was all to change the second night when we had an influx... and one of them was .....a SNORER! It was bad the first night, but I was so tired I didn’t even hear it until when I was waking up in the morning. The others all complained about it and I was dreading the next night... but it was fine! Until I went down to breakfast and saw the others. Apparently it was like world war 3! They were up, poking him, rocking he bunk beds, yelling and you name it, but he slept right through it and so did I – my bed a mere 20cms away!!! Hilarious! I must be tired!!!!



I had to laugh too when the hostel asked if I was interested in going on a pub crawl. In other places in Europe when we do pub crawls they maybe start at 8 thirty or 9pm, but in typical Spanish fashion the pick up for the pub crawl is at 1am!!! Crazy!!! And um, no thanks!!! Here to catch up on sleep!!! :-)



The people in Madrid are all so nice and friendly too and all say hello and talk to you, even understanding my out of practice Spanish and talking back so I can understand them! So nice! Not so awesome is the fact you can still smoke everywhere. So nasty! As I write this sitting in the common room my eyes are stinging like crazy! Disgusting!!



I really love the street signs in Madrid as well – they are all a set of four painted tiles with the street name in fancy lettering and a little picture explaining the name. So cool!!!



It has been an amazing week in Madrid, I have loved having the opportunity to practice my Spanish and relearn how to speak again!!! I totally love the city, but not sure if that has to do with the amazingly friendly people, the city is easy to navigate and small enough to walk everywhere or whether it is the first actual holiday where nothing to do but just chill in maybe forever!!!! Whatever it is, it is amazing!



Oh I forgot to say - the reason I ended up in Madrid in the first place was to take part in a volunteer program helping people to learn spanish - http://www.puebloingles.com/ - but in the end the dates didn&apos;t work out. It looks like a really cool program though if anyone is interested!
 
Toledo - the old capital of Spain

2010-10-04

I had heard about Toledo - the old capital of Spain and UNESCO world heritage protected site just a bus ride away from Madrid and so meeting a few guys at the hostel - DuVale, an American, Michael, an Austrian, we decided to head over and check it out. I love the randomness of traveling and hostels like that, one day you are off exploring with random people from around the world!



We had been told that the bus would take an hour and a 1/4 so we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves arriving in about 45 mins! As we walked up, we had an awesome view of the walled city built on top of a mountain and with a river most the way around it. Beautiful and picture perfect for medieval defense with a view hundreds of kilometers into the distance!



We entered through The Puerta de Bisagra, the main gates into the city from the bus station into Toledo - the capital of Spain from the Gothic era until 1560. Their main economy seems to be in the manufacture of swords and knives and...marzipan! They were all everywhere you looked in the little cobblestones streets winding their way into squares and beautiful old churches everywhere you turned.



After 2 years in Europe I am really quite over churches, but the Toledo cathedral was exceptional! We could see it at the end of most of the streets in town and when we finally arrived in front of it, it did not disappoint. With beautiful carvings and sculptures on the outside, it even depicted the entire last supper! Wandering further we randomly came across the amazing Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes which was another massive and stunning building rising out of nowhere.



We treated ourselves to a the delicious local Spanish rice and seafood dish, paella for lunch in a local restaurant before wandering around the entire city walls and back down to catch our bus back to Madrid.



Back in Madrid for a night to chillax before the holiday is over! I am back on the road again heading off to Valencia tomorrow!



I have just re-read this and realise it is the most plain dairy entry I have ever written! Sorry to disappoint, but I think it is the first time in the entirety of my travels that nothing strange, random or out of the ordinary has happened!!! Bizarre! But fingers crossed it stays that way as I will be in Africa in 2 weeks!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
 
Hello beautiful! Valencia, Spain

2010-10-06 to 2010-10-08

I was quite sad to leave my little home in Madrid, the staff knew me

by name, I just had one roomate in our big 6 pers dorm, and he was a

lovely guy who was never there, I knew my way around, everyone was

friendly.... But then I came to Valencia and instantly fell in love

with the city even more!



Leaving Madrid, I caught the awesome 1 euro metro so easily to the bus station, but

the bus I had wanted was full! Random! I had just checked online that

morning... I brought a ticket for the next cheap one and settled down

to wait the next three hours (waiting- something I was also getting

quite good at!)



Everyone was down at the gate really early, and I figured it was to get a good

seat as the bus opened, we loaded our own bags and I joined the crush

to get on. But hmmm allocated seats! So they all were just super

keen! Every single seat on the bus was full too so I guess I was quite

lucky. And all locals as well, so it must be quite a popular route.

The bus was lovely and new and it was a nice pleasant journey- unlike

my last in eastern Europe! Even the service stop was efficient with at

least a dozen buses I counted but enough toilets for all!





I arrived into Valencia almost five hours later and went outside to

catch the bus. It pulled up as I was running down the road, but on

seeing me running with my backpack( I am getting quite good at it

now!) he waited for me, gave me a massive hello and chatted to me in

Spanish before driving on. At the next stop he got out of his

compartment to practice his English with me for a bit and as all the

locals got on they stopped to say hello or smile at me! So nice! The

driver made sure i knew my stop and waved goodbye as he left!



Wow, the city was beautiful as well! I had been dropped at the edge of

the old part of town and walked down the main pedestrian mall to easily

find my hostel on a side street a few hundred metres away. And a late

night frozen yoghurt and fresh fruit shop!! I may never leave!!!



Walking around the city was beautiful, so clean and tidy, and in

typical Spanish style, everyone was still out and about and eating

dinner, even though it was after 9pm on a weeknight. They are serious

about their soccer too! Everywhere I went there were fields and it looked like every

able male between the ages of 6 and 40 was out there at training! It was

awesome!!!! Hundreds and hundreds of people across fields all around

the city! Everywhere you looked. I had to laugh though- I saw one

girls team training and they were on the dirt, not grass or AstroTurf

and just with the ambient lighting from the streets, not floodlights

like the men!



Unfortunately my 12 bed dorm was not quite the same, but hey, it was cheap! I am not exactly sure what breakfast was, but I think it was the worst I have ever tasted! There was the option of what looked like cornflakes or coco pops. Naturally I went for the cornflake look alike and poured the provided room temperature long life milk on them. And wow. I think someone must have been in that kitchen all night shredding up cardboard, as that is exactly what I imagine cardboard to taste like! And with the tepid milk that tasted just a little bit funny, even when I tipped in 2 packets of jam onto it, still could not eat it! I tried my best though, never turn down free food on the road!!



Walking around the city, it was equally as beautiful in the daylight. Churches, squares and little side streets with cafes full of outdoor seating, and a fresh food market! It was so cool!! I found the meeting point and joined in on the free city walking tour. Valencia has a really interesting history, none of which I can remember now, but I do remember being intrigued at the time when he was explaining it! We started out in the old Muslim area full of windy roads that when the Christians and Muslims were fighting, the opposition got so lost they never had a chance to take over the area!



We saw the Casa de Marquis de Dos Aguas, which has an amazing facade and a cute little story about how water has always been a big issue in Valencia and so every Thursday at midday a council of 6 men leave the Casa de Marquis de Dos Aguas and walk to the Cathedral where they sit down and wait for any issues regarding water and irrigation to be brought up. If there are, these are dealt with and the outcome is binding, as a law. If no issues are brought up, they wait a couple of minutes and then walk back! Bizarre! But the ceremony has been going on for hundreds of years and so remains so today!



The original entrance to the city is the Serrano towers, where noble prisoners used to be imprisoned. You can also still see the holes from which boiling oil were poured down on invaders and the slits from where the archers fired their arrows which was pretty cool. The gates used to be locked at half past 8 each evening and if you weren&apos;t inside the walls by then you most likely would not survive the night outside the medieval city between the wild animals, crocodiles from the river, and dodgy rapists, murders and thieves loitering outside the gates waiting!



We stopped by some of the oldest Horchateria&apos;s... I dont know how to translate that! Places that sell Horchata. Useful? :-) So, Horchata is a traditional Valencian alcoholic drink made of Tigernuts, water and sugar, originally from the period of Muslim presence in Valencia (from the 8th to 13th century) and looks like milk!



I also could not explain tiger nut - so Wikipedia has done it for me - A species of sedge native to warm temperate to subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is an annual or perennial plant, growing to 90 cm tall, with solitary stems growing from a tuber. The tubers are edible, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavour. Still none the wiser?? Don&apos;t worry neither am I! They are about the size of a pea, but more irregular, brown and taste like a nut!



We saw one of the smallest houses in the world - a metre wide! SO impractical! But now a part of the shop next door. And about a million churches, the region is a very strong catholic area and there are churches everywhere! They are stunning, but amazing how many there are, and they are still all in use. In fact, there are so many churches that the locals ran out of materiels to build them..and so on one church we see the arches filled with random things such as old statues with the head still smiling out at us!



The main Cathedral is definitely stunning though, massive and so beautifully constructed and you can see it from a lot of places throughout the city. Apparently it is nice inside, but I think I am all churched out at the moment!



It also made me laugh - all that is left of the old Roman city walls that were located during construction of various things, the buildings have been constructed as planned around the ruins and they have just placed a window there so tourists can press their noses up against it and see where it was!



As I arrived into Valencia, I had the option to walk to my hostel in

town- walk down the river were the directions, but try as I might, I

didn&apos;t find a river! Turns out that the river Turia was blocked and

redirected by the christians... Or Muslims, French, castianos,

catalans, austrians or somebody during one of the occupations! Too

many to keep track of! :). Later the government had a plan to turn the

disused river bed into a highway, but the locals revolted and planted

trees in there preferring to keep the area as parkland. They won, and

today it is an awesome park for kilometers, with soccer fields, masses

of gardens, trees, grass, seats, paths, fountains and everyone uses it

to run, walk places, cycle, picnic or take the kids too! So nice! At

the end it also culminates into a futuristic looking area with several

art and science museums. The structures are amazing, one shaped like

the human eye, the others all random, and surrounded by a massive

massive pond of White mosaics! A little bright and shiny in the heat

of the day, but very cool nonetheless!



I also tried the orchata, orxata or any other spelling you wish! It is

weird- drinking a milky drink that tastes like nuts and makes you feel

like you should be chewing it. Not bad, just a little too odd, I

couldn&apos;t finish my cup! The tigernut are also known as chufa or xufa

locally.



Oh yes, I should have mentioned too, Valencia is also most famous for

and home to the delicious fish dish paella and.... The Valencia orange!



Although valencia was beautiful and the locals so friendly, I wasn&apos;t

sad to leave center Valencia hostel. It wasn&apos;t BAD.... The location

was amazing, there was free wifi and computers. It&apos;s just that the

staff were lazy and unhelpful, the breakfast was unbelievably

inedible, in fact will probably rate as one of the worst ever!! my

room was right at the entry, across from the computers and common room

and next to the vending machines and lift. We had 12 people squished

in, 1 bathroom, not good at bedtime or morning!!!! And one window that

opened out next to luggage storage and near the computers... And lots

of guys snoring!! Ah, yes, hello noise and stale air! Oh and there was

this one guy whose alarm went off at 0645 and then about every ten

minutes for at least half an hour and he still never got up!! I was

almost looking forward to my night at the airport!



And so I caught the convenient bus to the equally convenient station

and had a nice and convenient journey back to Madrid, jumped on the

convenient and clean metro and conveniently arrived at terminal 4 ,

ready for the night!



I did love my time in Spain! There is so much more to the country than

just Barcelona, where most people (and I previously) just go. In fact,

I found the remainder of Spain quite different to Barcelona, I&apos;m not

sure whether that is the castillian as opposed to the catalan

influence from their seperate histories, but I don&apos;t think so as

Valencia too was also Catalan. Although I know I am ridicuously lucky

with all the opportunities I get, if only I had more time and money

money I could properly explore the country, through Portugal and

overland then ferry to morocco!! ah one, one can always dream! :)
 
From sleeping in Madrid Airport to crew party, London!

2010-10-09 to 2010-10-14


I unfortunately couldn&apos;t check in early and so wandered around Madrid Airport to find the best spot for the night. I had checked out www.sleepinginairports.net  , read up on terminal 4 and knew what to expect! And unfortunately not much, seats with armrests so you cant lie down and no carpet, dark or quiet areas!

I found an out of the way area, hooked my bags to the guard railing, lay out my sleeping bag on the cold hard tiles and settled in! The lights were peircingly bright so I was pleased I had my sponge bob squarepants eyemask the girls I had nannyed in Austria had given me.

Unfortunately between the lights, the sub zero aircon, the ridiculously cold, hard floor and the constant announcements- just to let you know there is no smoking in the airport; Don&apos;t leave your bags unattended and there are no boarding announcement announcements.... EVERY 15 mins it wasn&apos;t the worlds greatest night sleep, but still it definitely beat getting up at the crack of dawn to spend a fortune on a taxi to get there! Nice and relaxing instead! :)

I woke up 10 mins before I had to check in, casually sauntered over and was through.Easy!

Soooo technically if you really wanted to go by, say, the law :) I may have overstayed my time in Europe SLIGHTLY... And as a result of that and the fact that recently several other friends in similiar siuations had the dreaded stamp in their passport telling them when they had to leave by or when they could not return before... I was a little, okay way apprehensive!

London city airport didn&apos;t have signs up on which lanes for EU citizens and which lanes for foreigners, so I found another random blue passporter ( as opposed to the maroon of the EU) and yup, soon discovered we were the wrong queue! Ugh. First strike! Grumpy line Nazi. Second strike! I moved forward and attempted to answer the first question of my time in Europe as vaguely as possible without arousing suspicion. Luckily he was captivated by my plan to be in Addis Ababa the following week and as he flicked through my plethora of stamps in my passport, smiling he asked &apos;why, is it that Australians always say how good their country is, but all they ever want to do is leave?&apos; yes! I had made it through!

It was sooooooo nice to be in a place that spoke English again! It is hard to describe how much you really appreciate it until it happens!! At first I was still listening really hard everytime I was in a shop or asked for anything to try and figure out what was going on or how much things would cost, and then I realised i understood!!! (well mostly anyway! There are some really tough british accents out there!! :) )

I arrived into a freezing cold grey, overcast, gloomy, and any other adjective you can think of day typical English day!!! ... In my Spanish summer shorts and t shirt. Not so nice! I boarded the train and made my way to Shepherds Bush where I was to stay for the next few nights. I was pleasantly surprised to literally find the hostel right across from the tube! score! My fellow Topdeck crew mates arrived and we settled into our room before a quick shower and straight off to our end of season crew meeting..... And then party! It was awesome catching up with other crew I hadn&apos;t seen on the road in ages, and meeting some of the new guys I hadn&apos;t run into yet.

After an epic night, we somehow managed to awake early the next morning, get dressed in our german drindls from Oktoberfest we randomly carry around with us and jumped on the train to &apos;the church&apos;. Probably pretty much as opposite to a church you can get, the only significance is that it is on a Sunday morning!  http://www.claphamgrand.com/Club/index.php  Hundreds of people turn out before midday all dressed in whatever random fancy dress they can find and it is a massive party. To add to the charm you have to buy drink tickets and then purchase your drinks in threes, which if they are bottles (plastic of course!) they are all opened for you to carry around, and if they are cans they are placed in a plastic bag that you tie somewhere on your body or sling over your shoulder like some kind of Derro. Delightful! All part of the church charm!

After an epic day inside, around 4pm some unlucky &apos;wardens&apos; have the job of ushering hundreds of drunk people in the randomest outfits possible outside into the bright light, even though it feels like it should be pitch black and night! Down the road, onto the train and out of there without causing too many problems! Everyone then makes their way to the Shepherds Bush Walkabout pub to continue the festivites and craziness! And then hopefully survive the weekend!!! Crazy!!

Exactly what I felt like after a crazy weekend was getting up super early, relocating my backpack to the Topdeck hostel, the clink, in kings cross and then getting up to north london by 10 ready to have my shots for Africa!! Yes, nasty! Luckily the National Health Service (NHS) is quite good in a lot of regards, and i soon had my booster shots I needed, my prescriptions for malaria and altitude sickness medication, random other stuff and I was ready! To wait around some more :) I had my dental checkup next so I hung around my old stomping ground of Whetstone as I headed in, worried I may be up against my first filling! But no, survived another year filling free! Yay!

I then met up with Jarrad, my friend I used to work with there in Totteridge at The Orange Tree, and who had come to Topdeck to work with me and was now back at the old Orange Tree pub again. We then walked me to the bus stop as I was heading out to the chiropractorfurther north, as we waited for over an hour for the bus! Argh! Luckily I found the most amazing chiropractor in the world, who not only somehow genius-es away all my pains and stiffness, but even waited around super late for me to arrive!

I had a lot of running around to do in London and so began the circuit of outdoors stores as I attempted to find what I needed at a reasonable price! It took a while but by the end of the day I had all the necessities, thermarest sleeping mat, clipable drink bottle, ugly hiking pants, money wallet, travel pillow to name a few! I then met my friend Vicky and some of her friends at Jamie&apos;s Italian ( www.jamiesitalian.com  ) in Covent Garden. It is a restaurant of the famous English chef, Jamie Oliver and I was ready to go in, have a drink and expect not to be able to afford anything on the menu, but it was surprisingly affordable with starters and sides about 3 quid and small mains from 6! The restaurant was lovely, and you could see how much money he had with amazing bathrooms, comfy chairs and the decor so pretty. There were glass cupboards around the entire restaurant full of rows and rows and rows of FULL bottles of wine!!!!!!! Amazing! The food was nice and fresh, the service was great and we really enjoyed it. we even had a lemon polenta cake for dessert, which was delicious and not at all stodgy. I didn&apos;t even know you could make polenta into cake!

I spent a few days in London organising my life and everything I would need for the next 3 months out of civilisation, packing up my bags everyday again.... Still! To move rooms at the hostel- ahh cheap rates and lack of prior planning! :) and catch up with various Topdeck friends. I also travelled down to South London one evening to Putney to catch ip with an old Army mate, Babs. It was quite funny as I asked at the hostel reception how long it would take me to get to Putney. &apos;Putney?&apos; &apos;Putney?&apos; &apos;Putney?&apos; they all looked at each other until an Englishman checking in at the same time went.... Oooh &apos;&apos;Pootney&apos;! &apos;ahhh!&apos; they all said, &apos;half an hour!&apos; It was nice to catch up with Babs and see another bit of London.

I do love the way London is set out, with each place having the main street with all the shops and restaurants and everything on it, including usually the train/ tune stations and bus stops. Also aptly named... The High Street! So easy to navigate and find stuff! Putney had an amazing High St, full of everything you could need and so lively! We had a delicious dinner before hitting the local pub, complete with a lovely wood fire and then even though it was late, londons so convenient and easy public transport got me right home! So handy!

 
Off to see the Uk cuzzies in the countryside - Glouster, England

2010-10-15 to 2010-10-17


After meeting Paul and Sarah, a couple of English cousins at Grandma&apos;s 90th in NZ last year, with a couple of days spare in the gloomy english weather, I decided to head out into the English countryside to see them in Glouster.

Jumping on a surprisingly delightful national express bus with friendly staff, cfy seats and loads of leg room... So much so my feet didn&apos;t even reach the footrest! And in just under three hours I was pulling into Glouster.

Paul and Sarah pulled up waving, jumped out for a warm welcome and took me home for a delicious home cooked fish pie, an entire backpack worth of laundry, a real bed with a cosy doona... Or shall I say duvet! and a nice warm real house!

The next day we jumped in the car and headed out to Coopers Hill, famous for the annual cheese rolling competition that is held there. It was cancelled this year due to problems with the thousands of people trying to fit into the very small space, and I have no idea how they will solve it, but apparantly it is on again in 2011!

So Coopers Hill is a ridiculously steep piece of hill about 30m wide and less than a 100m long where a wheel of the famous double Glouster cheese is rolled down and crazy contestants chase, run, throw themselves, roll down the hill to grab that wheel before anyone else does! Along the way several people break bones, injure themselves and are stopped by rows of marshalls at the bottom before they catapault themselves into a house located right at the finish!!! Crazy!!! And all just for the glory!!! There are two narrow roads up to the hill that was barely suitable for a car, letalone a bus, so I have no idea how people got up there? Get there a few hours early and walk I guess! And besides the actual hill part, no idea where the thousands of spectators would stand!

We then headed through the lovely countryside to Winchcombe, where Sarah&apos;s parents live, which is a very cute old town abouta trillion years old! In fact, its history dates back to teh Romans in 43 AD!!!!!!  Their house is an old shop from years and years ago on the main road.

We headed back through Cheltenham to the Glouster docks which besides the cheese, massive cathedral you can see from everywhere, the old spot pigs and the murderers Fred and Rosemary West, is the main attraction in the area! It is still being developed, but it is a lovely area with the water, lots of canal boats and restaurants everywhere.

Heading home, Paul started on a delicious traditional English roast with all the trimmings, including that strange English delicacy, Yorkshire puddings, a kind of batter mix baked in muffin trays in the oven and turns into a hard to describe hollow muffin to go with your roast! Sarah had a baby shower that night so I helped her decorate the cake before Paul and I braced the sub zero... Well practically!! Outside air temperature to walk down to the local pub. I still can hardly believe a week ago I was sweating in shorts and a singlet in Spain and now I am wearing coats, scarves and gloves!!!! Brrr!!!!

The next morning Paul cooked up a traditional English breakfast with beans, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, sausages, hash browns and toast before it was time to grab a packed lunch they made for me and roll me down to the bus stop and back on the bus for London!

 
My final days in civilisation - Old London Town, England

2010-10-17 to 2010-10-19


Back into Old London town, I headed to my other home away from home, the Topdeck hostel - the clink - in Kings Cross (  http://www.clinkhostels.com/ ) which is literally an old courthouse and is set out in that manner still. There are cells you can sleep in - small claustrobophic rooms with a double bunk and no sopace for anything else! And the computer and TV rooms are the old courtrooms which is quite cool. It is a 700 person hostel though so sometimes can be a little too crowded!!!

Well it is no secret that the English love to queue, but still after having been in so many places in Europe where it is elbows out and everyman for himself it is such a nice change to see an orderly queue where everybody just waits their turn!

And then, when people are in your way or bump into you or anything for that matter thry say sorry and move! So polite! I smile everytime I see it! Again I didn&apos;t realise I missed seeing it until o have been out of it and then come back and find it!

I think I have a love hate relationship with London. Yes, it is do secret I hate the gloomy grey cold weather, but there are so many things I love as well! The convenience and cheap flights to Europe, polite people that all say&apos;hiya when u walk in somewhere, cheap tesco supermarkets and boots pharmacies, the local pubs on every corner, the off licences like mini marts every 20m where you can buy whatever you like anytime of the day or night!

 
Leaving civilisation, London, England

2010-10-19

The bunks in our rooms were jammed in for maximum battery backpacker sleeping, and as a result, we were all sleeping mere milimetres from each other. The bunks did have high sides though so it wasn&apos;t too weird! BUT the guy next to me was a massive snorer and always was asleep by the time we got in and so had no chance to get to sleep first! I woke him up constantly to no avail, starting out with a polite tap and request to roll over before just shaking amd screaming :) it was just lucky he then checked out before I had to face court for killing him!



As a result, I spent my time in London very tired! The thing I love about London is for sure the people, just sitting in the hostel I ran into five different Topdeck friends whilst I was there, and on a random evening out then ran into several of my passengers! So much fun!!!



I also had the chance to catch up with my school friend Mabel, her little baby Nathan, emily and Aiden, and Toby and Ash who I first met three years ago whilst doing volunter work in Peru on the first leg of both of our adventures!



As usual, for anyone who has ever been subjected to the miserable task of seeing me pack, it was about 11pm the night before I left before I finally had the giant suitcase of my life Mabel had been storing for me and time to sit down and organise! And as usual after moving clothes around In random but useless piles for several hours I just jammed my suitcase and backpack closed, and only threw 2 things away! Back into store for the suitcase and literally a few hours sleep for me before it was time!
 
The journey to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

2010-10-20

The journey to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia



As I boarded the tube towards Heathrow airport, it ground to a halt as a voice indicated the dubious &apos;signal failure&apos;. We sat stationary got a while before we were on our way... Only for the tube to terminate at the next station! And the next three also... Oh oh! Getting a liiiiiiiiiiiittle worried about the time something was finally sorted, and we were on our way.... For me to make check in.... And then have &apos;technical problems&apos; with the aircraft and be delayed for over 3 hours as we sat in our little &quot;already passed all the checks gate&quot; with nothing around... Waiting, waiting, waiting!



After trying to fix the aircraft to no avail, a new plane was located and we were all bussed to the new departure point and finally on our way!!!



I was in what I like to refer to as Hells seat :) behind me were 2 screaming children who kept smashing my seat and their useless father who also kept knockinge in the head, somehow! Is it possible for a child to scream a whole flight?? The answer is yes!!!!!!!



Next to me I had a guy I think was Egyptian who spent half the flight with his elbows out, over into my seat area, jabbing me in the ribs, and the other half with his elbow on my entertainment control panel so just as it would get to an exciting part in the movie.... Toy Story 3 :)...... He would knock it to another channel or knock the volume up so loud I was deafened! Clearly, knowing me I was not at all subtle about my disdain but it made no difference whatsoever!!!!



Luckily the Eqyptian and literally 3/4 of the plane got off in Amman, Jordan so I then had some space to spread out and attempt to sleep through the screams behind me. But it was not to be as we arrived into Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at 4am local time, two hours behind schedule.



We all lined up for our visa&apos;s- a little room of four people; and a rather time consuming process.  You gave your passport and entry form to the first person who checked it, asked you a few questions and gave it to the second person, who took your 20 USD and handwrote a receipt, sticking a sticker from your visa onto it. The visa was then passed back with your stuff to the first person who handwrote all your details on the visa, then passed it back to the second person who handed it back to you. Wow! At least people are being employed I guess!!!



There was also a little sign as we came out saying &apos;suggistions box&apos;. So cute! :)



We then lined up for immigration where our visas, passports and forms were checked and I was asked where I was staying, as I had deliberately left this blank as I didn&apos;t know! As I was couchsurfing all I had was an email saying &apos; get the taxi driver to call th housekeeper on this number, the couchsurfing room is seperate from the main house so you will not disturb me!&apos; Luckily I somehow made it through, picked up my backpack and lined up again to have my bags scanned! And then we were through! An hour later! I dread to think how long we would have been there if the plane was full or if it was a regular size plane!!!



I walked determindly through to find a taxi i felt safe in and get me some sleep! Luckily almost immediately I was approached by the authorised taxi rep who spoke English, called the number I had, woke up the housekeeper, got directions, grabbed a few other people and walked us outside to the taxi carpark.



The first thing I noticed was how cold it was! Like almost London cold! Something I was not expecting from sunny Africa, even at 5am!



Speaking americ to each other, one of the drivers accepted the job, I was shown to the car and we began our journey. And doh! No seatbelts! The traffic was a little crazy as we headed  along, but I was pleasantly surprised how good the toads were.... Until damn! Spoke too soon! We dropped down to about 5 km/hr as we bumped along the pot holed dirt road, swinging across the width of the toad to find a drivesnle track. At this stage I started to get a little worried about where I was being taken, in the pitch black, not speaking the language, away from civilisation, roads and street lights, never to be seen again! I checked the door was unlocked, tightened by handbag and put my hand on the handle, ready for an emergency exit if needed, as I scoped escape routes to my right! At least there were still people around wAlking down the roads!!!



And then we slowed a little further and just stopped, sitting there not making a move in the middle of nowhere as I tried to establish what was going on. Great! I thought, quickly assessing my situitation!! But the response came in English, albeit slow and laboured- &apos;he will come&apos;. We sat there in the dark got another 15 mins when a figure approached out of the darkness. &apos;you must walk&apos; I was instructed as I picked up my backpack and stumbled following the stranger for about 20 mins through the blackness and twisty, windy uneven dirt  roads of the shanty town area as I tripped constantly and wondered firstly what I had gotten myself into, and secondly if I would ever be seen again! I did feel perfectly safe and calm by now, just bizarred out!



Turns out my lead was the housekeeper, Shoa, and he didn&apos;t speak a scrap of English! He tried his best and we had a highly amusing conversation where neither of us understood a thing!  He appeared to be particularly taken with the electricity lines though and kept pointing them out! The other thing I got was &apos;clado&apos; and &apos;internet&apos; meaning I guess he was telling me he knew who I was, and that  my host &apos;Claudio&apos; had organised with me over the Internet!



He opened the high gates attached to a large fence and showed me to my room which was a standalone room with a cosy looking mattress and blankets on the dloor; and gave me firstly a number 4 with his fingers and then mimed out Claudio and I meeting with lots of and smiles and waves. And then a number 2, which I couldn&apos;t quite confirm. Either way I figured I was meeting Claudio at either 2 or 4 that day!



I was shown the bathroom, about 30m away around the other side of the house, and where to get the water to flush the toilet and wash my hands, as there was no running water. The bathroom door didnt come close to closing and there was no pipe from the dink- the water just dropped from the drain to the floor! was almost 6 am by the time I collapsed shattered into bed. So ridiculously tired! But also with a pounding headache that just wouldn&apos;t go!


 
The city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

Aknock at the door brought me out of my dreams. My head still pounding as I opened up to find who I presumed to be my host Claudio, hi! I said, &apos;i&apos;m koshey, nice to meet you!&apos; &apos;ahhh&apos; he replied! &apos;You are the Australian! I thought you were coming next month! Ah, nevermind, no problem!&apos; we had a brief chat, of which none I can remember except he comes home for lunch at 12ish! And the fact he was probably windering who his housekeeper had brought home!!! I checked my watch - half past 8! Sweet as! Heaps of time to slep, as I snuggled back into bed.







Before I knew it there as another knock at the door, thinking I had overslept, I quickly checked my watch. Half past 9! Opening up, I found who i gurssed to be one of the female staff, but I couldn&apos;t understand! I finally figured out she  was asking if I wanted coffee or tea for breakfast. So glad to have something to drink as the shops were closed at the airport wheni arrived and therefore no water, I was parched! Requesting water, a massive Bottle then turned up with a glass on a tray! Heaven! Gulping it down, I quickly fell back asleep, waking to another knock and steaming plate of a kind of scrambled plain egg in really small pieces with tomato juice all through it. That&apos;s my best guess and description anyway!!! :) delicious!







And out like a light... Again! And straight into those old too weird for words doxy dreams after taking my tablet. Haven&apos;t missed those at all!! :)







Meeting Claudio, he explained there is a furnished couchsurfers room complete with ensuite and running water which a friend was in at the momemt, but I would upgrade there tomorrow. Claudio was a third generation Ethiopian, and living in a local area do I had my wish to stay with a local after all!







Ethiopia I believe is the only African nation not to be colonised, but was occupied by Italians for 5 years after the war, which is when Claudio&apos;s ancestors came out and stayed. He is in the furniture business and has  2 little girls 8 and 9 years old who are just beautiful, and go to the international school here. There are also 4 local staff as far as I can tell, 2 girls, Mystika and Dimiri, and 2 men Shoa and another I only see from a distance who all speak no English, but are all super friendly.







There is always a massive water shortage and so go easy on it and ask the Shoa who is in charge of it! I was also warned not to walk around after dark and that although the area wasn&apos;t the best, people knew who he was and that he hosted foreigners and I would be safe... Just guard my stuff! :)







Asking for the address, turns out there isn&apos;t one!!! Great!!! How was I ever going to find my way back?!! He drew a circle on my 1 to a million map with no street names and told me the area - Rechi- as he handed over loan of a local sim card for the inevitable time when I got lost!! Luckily he asked Shoa to walk me to the main road, pointing out landmarks so I could find my way. It was about a 25 min walk to the main road, through the windy shanty town streets, and then onto a feeder road, walking on the side with dirt flying, cars whizzing past and choking on their black exhaust fumes.







Changing money at the bank, I walked straight in as Shoa was stopped and frisked. He just shrugged his shoulders, apparantly all wrsterners are let through and all locals frisked!







Waving goodbye I attempted to find my bearings on a map with no street names, matching up with streets with no street names. Yes, like nailing jelly to the wall! Somehow I matched up the lie of the land and off I went! First stop the hilton hotel for a real map, tourist info and free clean toilets! Having my handbag searched and then through the scanners, I was finally inside, and it didn&apos;t disappoint!







Back on the streets I was amazed at people just lying on the footpaths or the median strips on the roads. My first awful thought was that they were dead, but then I saw one move. Nope, just weird! :) As I walked it became more and more apparent that I was the only tourist around as people stared, said hello or wanted to touch my hands or talk to me. It was a nice novelty at the start, but by the end if the day it definitely started to wear thin. I dont know how celebrities do it!!! :)







Wow everything is a distance apart!!! I found my way to the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is dedicated to the memory of those, including British troops that died in the war of Liberation. A local guy who speaks no english takes you on the tour and points! There are also huge stone tombs inside of Emperors from years and years ago. In the compound is the more famous mekane sillassie ethiopian orthodox church which is totally circular and built in 1890 G.C.







The thing I found most interesting was the memorial to those killed by the Derg during the uprising in Ethiopia. Inside there are the names and photos of the 68 who were murdered and it is the ENTIRE heirachy of the country- the Emperor, prime minister, head of defence and heads of the services, head of police, most of the ministers in parliament to name just a few. Unbelieveable.







Continuing on, and trying not  to be killed by the traffic as the only way  to cross is by playing frogger, moving forwards and backwards out of direct lines of cars as they swerve across the lanes of the road without slowing, regardless of your status on a crossing!







I arrived at the National Museum where the skeleton of the famous Lucy is kept, the oldest human ever found at 3.2 million years! There is only various parts of bones, but they have created a recreation so we can see. And she is Tiny! Like 1m! Apparantly someone told me later that was a replica, the real Lucy is on tour in America!!







I then got out my useless map and attempted to navigate myself through the unsigned streets which was a total mission.  About an hour later, going the most direct way, which was still crap! :) I arrived at the Taitu hotel which Claudio had told me was a bit of a backpacker place and I may find some people to travel with. But alas no, a regular hotel and no shared rooms and no message board!







A Long long long long walk followed, like 2 hours back! Getting covered in dust and struggling to breathe through the pollution off all the cars and get through the throngs of people and cars as well was not so fun!! There were a lot of beggars around, but only one that followed me for any distance. I started talking to some locals, Jonas and Masri  who were out walking and enjoying the evening and walked me to my neighbourhood- Rechi- and safely across the street of 12 lanes of traffic. Crazy!! Jonas called me and said when they had gotten home their neighbourhood was on fire and 10 homes were lost!!! Their house was damaged, but okay. Luckily no one besides a dog was killed.







After turning off the road and into the shanty town area rabbit warren of paths, it was getting dark and i missed the first right hand turn I had to take. Standing and trying to figure out where the tall phone tower was and how to get there about a dozen people all came up and tried to help, and with no one speaking English,  i drew a picture of the phone tower. Clearly my artistic skills left a lot to be desired as there was then much more discussion trying to figure it out! Someone decided he knew the way and took me back along the way I had come, asking various people along the way for confirmation, but mo one seemed reslly sure. As it started to look familiar again, someone came up behind me and shook me hand smiling at the procession leading me. It was Shoa! I thought he had somehow magically found me, but turned out he was just returning from an errand! We rounded the corner and the phone tower came into view, a few more turns and we were home. Not so far after all!







Each evening Claudio and his friends relax in the room i was in, smoking, smoking Sheisha, and eating ..... Chata One of the countries largest exports, it is a plant that you get branches from, snap off the leaves and chew them them! It is a amphetamine and illegal in the USA and most of Europe but a very common pastime in eastern Africa.







Due to the altitude, my pounding headache, nausea and lack of energy I hadn&apos;t eaten in town the dishes that Claudio had recommended. He then ordered me from his staff the traditional dishes instead! Ethiopians like to eat their meat raw so I had been told always ask for well done! The bread was odd... Made from millet flour and called injera, it is Kind of pancakey, Flat, a little goey, brown, sour and with bubbles across it giving me the impression of tripe, I wasn&apos;t the biggest fan in the world, but it did go okay with the dishes which you spooned onto it and then picked up with your fingers, using the bread as a wrapper. The dishes were delicious, one with over 30 spices, with veg and meat like a  stew; and the other a very spicy lamb shank with an unusual flavour.







Something  Claudio said then turned the lightbulb on in my head! Ding! Addis is about 2500m, so a high altitude- make sure you wear sunscreen he said! Ahh between that and the doxy malaria tablets That make you burn like a tomato, I am doomed!!







Oh yes, the lightbulb! It suddenly dawned on me two previous occasions I had had pounding headaches I could not shake, regardless of sleep, water or painkiller intake- the Himalayas and in Cuzco, Peru. Damn altitude!!!! It always gets me! Oh well, at least I know what it is! Bring on 48 hours and the extra red blood cells!! :)
 
Being taken for a ride, the fistula hospital and Market, Addis, Ethiopia

2010-10-22

A continued pounding headache greeted me as I awoke to hearing all the various animals calling in the day. Altitude I hate you!! :)





A nice surprise then followed as I was greeted by one of the girls with a fresh avocado juice on a tray. Wow it was delicious too!!! Some incommunication followed due to neither of us speaking each others language where she asked me if I wanted something to eat and I said yes, and waited for the food. She then returned and asked me if I wanted a tea or coffee to which I replied no.... And I think that caused some confusion as nothing arrived in half an hour and I looked outside to see everyone cleaning. I think next time I will just say yes to everything and hope for the best!!! :)





I tried to call a taxi with the number that Claudio had given me, but of course we could not understand each other and I chased down Shoa to help out, he could not understand where I was going either, but at least I got the taxi coming! When the taxi arrived He still could not figure it out so I gave the driver the fistula hospitals number so he could ring and get directions.







The taxi was missing parts all over and held together by wire. I was even given the shared handle so I could attach it and wind my window down! And then hand it back when I was finished! The drive was interesting, seeing all sorts of farm animals such as goats and sheep and bulls everywhere. We also passed ladies doing their washing in buckets on the side of the street and all sorts of day to day activities. Everyone here seems to love bob Marley and we even had a reggae singalong in the taxi which was quite cool!







The traffic was crazy though and very soon between the dust and black car fumes I was struggling to breathe and not either vomit or pass out. I know u keep talking about them, but it us difficult to insgine how aful it actuslly is if you are not there. It is so not nice!! I was also starting to get a little concerned as we had been driving for ages and the driver was just telling me &apos;no worries&apos; everytime I tried to ask anything. Finally he started asking for directions yelling at other drivers around us or pedestrians on the pavement. And we FINALLY arrived!!! Literally an hour and a half since we left. I thought that being Claudios friend the driver would not rip me off, but alas I was wrong and was forced to hand over 200 Birr for the trip. So moreorless 14 USD, but for a ride that I later found out should have taken 20 mins and 75 Birr, about 5USD ( about 14 Birr to 1 USD). So effectively triple the amount! So already hot, headachey, feeling sick on fumes, and angry I headed inside to find my contact Feven&apos;s office. But  it was all locked up! I waited for about 15 minutes and a lady appeared who introduced herself as Sisay and said that Feven had been called to an outpost centre and would not be back til Tuesday (it was Friday). Oh no! I was really looking forward to seeing her as we had been in contact for months and she was going to arrange an itinerary for my time there!! Now I had already seen everything in Addis, in a city i didnt particularly like, and was stuck for another 4 days!! I was quite heartbroken, especially when she confirmed that Dr Hamlin had been called away to Australia and would not be there either. Additionally as I had arrived so late I had also missed the visit to  Desta Mender, (Joy Village) the rehabilitation and re-integration centre.







For  those who have been following my blog or I have spoken to recently would know my sole purpose of being in Ethiopia was to see Dr Hamlin, the hospital and see the work being done to rebuild lives.  It meant so much to me that i was going to climb mt kilimanjaro to raise money for them! So after the morning I had had, the altitude sickness and then the above, I was quite down. I should have taken Feven&apos;s offer for a driver to pick me up, but the place I was staying at was so difficult to find that I didn&apos;t want to put anyone out!!!







Sisay then said she would take me on a tour of the hospital, So I tried to put it behind me and appreciate what I had the opportunity to see.







The Hamlin Fistula Hospital, Addis Ababa (as I described in my blog on my climb- I won&apos;t bore you all again! :) ) is beautiful! Immediately I was struck by the gorgeous gardens throughout the grounds, which I know that Dr Hamlin is quite proud of. They kind of hid each building from the next and made it feel more like a park than a hospital.







We started out seeing the main ward which was much bigger than I expected it to be, and looked really happy with each girls brightly coloured quilt that they are given.







We then saw the next ward up which i cannot remember what it was called, where the girls spend 12 days and the recovery ward when they come out of theatre and spend 2 days.





There was the operating theatre, and the maternity ward for those having, or about to have babies who had suffered from a fistula before to ensure they were properly cared for. We then went through a few more wards and saw the building that Oprah Winfrey had donated.







Down to the physiotherapy area and saw pictures of girls that had arrived, looking literally like AIDS patients, so skinny and ill and unable to even walk from a combination of the fistula, nerve damage and lying curled up for so long waiting for their bodies to heal themselves. But then, next to them were pictures of when they left, sometimes acyear later and you can&apos;t even recognise them they look so great. Simply amazing.







There was also a lesson going on in the hospital classroom to educate the girls whilst they are there in various subjects from both the school cirruculum and to help themselves in their siuations.







The girls are also all taught a skill whilst they are in the hospital, beautiful embroidery for tablecloths, or making traditional craft items such as bright jewellery boxes or platters for the traditional coffee ceremony out of what looks like cane. When visitors come through and purchase an item the money is then given to the girl that made it.







Whilst in the hodpitsl, the girls wear the top part of stockings. So not as to waste the legs when they are cut off, these are plaited and sewn into mats! Quite cool!







The thing that struck me most though was how ridiculously young some of the girls looked. Like children themselves, and yet to be struck down with this awful condition. I can&apos;t even imagine what their lives would be like in the hospital wasn&apos;t there to help them.







No female with a fistula is turned away and the remarkable thing is that they are all treated entirely for free, even though the hospital relies entirely on donations to exist. What is then asked of them is that they continue to talk about the work of the hodpitsl when they go home so everyone will be made aware that they can be helped.





Pretty amazing, and pretty amazing that just thecdedication of two people - the Hamlins- made it possible.





I think part of the problem i was experiencing was that Sisay&apos;s English wasn&apos;t very good as I tried to explain the problem I had getting there and wasn&apos;t sure the best way back, she just smiled and said &apos;okay, goodbye&apos;. At this point she could tell I was getting upset and said as an afterthought, &apos;oh and we are glad you came.&apos; Not that I expected anything, but it was a far cry from the support everyone else associated with the fistula hospital and charities had shown me. A little over it, i explained again and she finally understood my predicament and organised for a car to drop me into town when it went out on it&apos;s next errand. The driver and staff member on the errand were amazing. They showed me exactly where the public bus went, pointed out televant landmarks, and could not believe the driver I had had in the morning which made me feel so much better!







They pointed out the house that the Hamlins had first lived in when they had arrived in Addis, their royal neighbours, the old hospital site and everything I had read about in Dr Hamlins book - The hospital by the River. It was great! We were actually quite close to town, something I didn&apos;t realise from my adventure that morning and they pointed out all the landmarks and helped me locate them on the map. So helpful! I was then dropped off in a main area and my route pointed out for me. So good!







Unfortunately I had to walk along the fume and dust infested area of the main road, but at least it ensured I didn&apos;t get lost in the ridiculous town planning. As I again was getting a little overbit all as I choked on the fumes and had a guy selling massive wall hanging plastic calender maps of Africa constantly harass me, a friendly face fell into step and started chatting. He scared map guy away and made sure I didn&apos;t miss my turn off. So nice!







I continued along towards my destination- the Merkato - the largest open air Market in Africa. Apparantly I couldn&apos;t miss it! Apparantly! I&apos;m not sure how I was supposed to tell it apart from every other street stall and so wandered around, getting stared at, having comments shouted at me in Americ and everybody around them laugh, kids trying to grab my water bottle and my fair share of being followed. Not so nice. It didn&apos;t help that this was apparantly THE place you were going to be pickpocketed.







And I still couldn&apos;t find the markets!!! Again SO over it I was was going to check aroundcthe last corner andcthen turn around when i heard a friendly &apos;Buenos Dias&apos;. I smiled back to the well dressed gentleman in jeans and a rather dirty cream suit jacket and replied in Spanish. A brief conversation ensued in spanish when he asked me if I was going to the markets and that he would show me the entrance. Asking my name and country he was a little shocked when I replied Australia and promptly asked laughing  in english why we were speaking Spanish?!!! We then swapped to English and he took me around to the markets, which I might add were stil a good 5 mins off around a few corners I doubt I would have found! In addition, once we entered the markets I was very glad I was not alone as we twisted and turned through tight alleyways and everyone left me alone as I was with a local! it was quite funny at one stage, I raised my camera to take a photo of a stall full of spices and both men in the stall raised their camera phones  back to take photos of me!! Hularious! I don&apos;t think many tourists make it down that way!!







The Market was split up into different areas, spices, herbal medicines, traditional clothes, coffee beans  (ethiopias largest export), traditional clothes, modern clothes, ceramics, tools, traditional handicrafts, plastics, kitchen things, electronics, stuff for the traditional coffee ceremony and the list goes on! Everything you could want! It was amazing! Everywhere we were moved out the way by men running along carrying massive heavy sacks on their heads delivering goods. It was crazy. Everywhere! My guide took me around each different area and explained what everything was and what it was used for, it was do interesting and places I would never have wanted to go into, or known to go into if i was alone. It was absolutely amazing!







I laughed so hard as we saw a few guys scrubbing shoes in buckets of water as if their life depended on it. My guide just laughed, &apos;they are making them new again!&apos; he said. And they did look good too! I will never look at the shoe sellers on the side of the road the same way again!!! :)







And the plastics area was amazing, stuff was organised and piled high on the roofs, in every available bit of space, as far as the eye could see. And I&apos;ll say it again. Amazing!! :)







And with the Market finished, my guide pointed me in the right direction, walked me to the crossroads so I wouldn&apos;t get lost, and we shook hands and parted ways. Just like that!!!! Yup, amazing!!! My Market saviour again arrived just when I had needed him too! I was so over it and ready to give up, hecarrived and made everything good again. Amazing!





On the way I decided to buy some oranges from the fruit stall as me diet was severely lacking in anything fresh and anything non cabohydrate. For half a kilo of oranges he tried to charge him 10 Birr, which I just knew was going to be dodgy and just put the oranges back down, when a lady nearby had heard, came over, went cross at him and she told me the real price of 5 birr. I pulled out my stack of 1 Birr notes in front of him as I took great delight in getting the oldest filthiest and torn ones out one by one as he tried to protest and take the new ones, as the lady who helped me pissed herself laughing. A small victory, but one I will claim as a victory nonetheless!





As I was almost in the equivalent of the centre of town, it took another good hour and a half or so to walk home again. Geez I am covering some k&apos;s! Not much choice though, if you want to see stuff you have got to get out there and walk!







By the time I had been constantly stared at, followed, harassed by several beggars, sellers, shoe shiners, grubby and snotty nosed (streetkids????) kids literally grabbing me and trying to steal the bread I was eating, and grabbing my handbag, yup, over it again!!







But then I arrived home, Mystik opened the gate and proudly showed me to my new room they had cleaned made up, and moved all my things in for me and set up!!! How nice was that!







Then, Although we don&apos;t even share a common language, one by one they all came in to check i was okay, was settled, could work everything in the bathroom okay and Dirim even brought me an extra blanket and tucked me in when I did my best mime of a headache trying to explain why I was in bed so relatively early. How sweet is all that!!!   The staff are all such lovely smiley and friendly people!!







Although it had its ups, I was ready for the day to be over and the new one to begin! It was weird though, each time today when I felt so over it that I was ready to add Addis to my black list of places never to return to and jump on the first bus out of here (and I was close! - I even went to the tourist board to ask but he wasn&apos;t interested in helping!!!) some random friendly Ethiopian came along and made everything okay! So odd how it happened, but I was just glad it did!!! :)







It does make me wonder all those people who say you can travel Africa as a single female. Either they have never tried it themselves, they were not as white as me and therefore didn&apos;t stand out as much, or they were not off the main tourist track as I appear to be. Sure you CAN do it, if you Constantly keep your wits about you, and not let anything at all get to you, but what&apos;s the point if it&apos;s not fun?!
 
The question on everybody&apos;s lips- how long does it take to get mugged in Africa? Ethiopia

2010-10-23

I was just getting up when Dimiri arrived with a fresh juice on a tray... It was red, and watermelonish, but not watermelon! Guava or papaya maybe? No idea, but tasty! Such a nice start to the day!







There is a shower- it operates with a pump and water from a drum outside, and it was not running when I tried to use it. Shoa came with some drums and another pump and about 20 mins later, refilled and ready for a quick rinse! I will never take running water for granted again! :)







I have now perfected my death glare, my instant direction changes, ripping items or arms away from people at speed, but still if one more streetkid, beggar, seller or random tries to stare, follow me, take me somewhere, grab my arm, bag, waterbottle, food or anything I have, I won&apos;t be held responsible for the consequences!!!







I attempted to go to the business centre... about a 45 min walk :) and get online, but after waiting for 25 mins for hotmail to open and then another 10 with no progress I gave up and hightailed it ( well another 45 min walk :) ) to the Hilton hotel for some normality... And toilets! seeing as there were none at all anywhere and no fast food restaurants to hit up! Most men just unzipped their pants and went in ditches on the sides of the roads, but unfortunately it was not so easy for a chick!  Fast Internet, clean toilets, smiling happy people who spoke English who could answer questions, running water and no one harassing! Bliss!!







I never saw any other tourists or westerners at all around which was quite nice, but you usually know that places they are eating in are safe! Nevertheless I selected a clean looking place in a busy area that looked like there was a high turnover of food and it would be fresh, and sat down. Well actually, I was looking from the outside and I was chased down and ushered in. No surprise there really!







I ordered the rice and cooked veg as it appeared to be the safest and not gross sounding thing on the menu.... Until I bit down on a mouthfull and tasted something gritty that wanted to break my teeth... Ahh pebbles! Of course. Luckily those were the only ones, but enough to make you wonder how safe the food was to eat....







But I didn&apos;t have to wait long, very soon I developed those telltale stomach cramps. And so the answer... How long does it take to get sick in Africa?  3 days :).







At a loss for what to do, I walked down Bole road, the main road out of town and came across the Red Terror Museum about the events and murders under the previous Ethiopian Government.





In the 70&apos;s, Under emporer Haile Selassie, the famine, (6 million people by 1991!!) landless peasants, the war in Eritrea and the accumulation of wealth by nobles led to strikes, demonstrations, peasant uprising and then a mutiny in 1974.





A military dictatorship was imposed on the country- the Derg - under Mengistu. The Americans were thrown out, union leaders, students, activists and all heirachy and royalty were jailed, then murdered, church activities banned and aid instead requested from the USSR. Months of chaos ensued and further reforms were implemented- population transfers to fight famine, conscription for all 18-70(!!!!!) year old males, further guerilla fighting from Eriteria, Somalia and other armies. In 1991 a coalition of rebel forces took over government and began the massive job ahead of them. Mengitsu fled to Zimbabwe where he is still today not able to be prosecuted.





A well dressed employee offered to guide me around and it turned out that he was a victim of the Derg, having been imprisoned under them for 8 years. He was lucky enough to survive, but subject to awful torture methods such as hanging people off a broomstick by behind their knees, wrists handcuffed in front and dirty socks shoved down their throats, cutting off their toes and nipples and was also missing all his molars after they were pulled out. So awful. Bodies of thousands and thousands of those killed were placed in mass graves and insidmuses museum there are hundreds of bones and various items of clothing with bones still attached. So awful. They also had coffins filled with remains. My guide couldn&apos;t contain his tears as he spoke about what had happened to him and thousands of others. 500000 are estimated to have been massacred, thousands more imprisoned, and millions more suffered. It is unbelieveable.







The museum/ memorial has also been built entirely with donations, no money from the government and only just opened this year, in 2010, after collecting enough money to do so.







I then continued down the road and a guy named Zimon started chatting to me. I was feeling charitable after my amazing museum visit and humoured him for a while. We then began talking about the Red Cross walk that was on the next day and I was trying to find information from someone who could speak English. He had a friend that volunteered for the red cross and called him up. I tried a traditional honey wine whilst we were waiting. Gross can be the only word used to describe it!!! Looking like honey, with a slightly thinner consistency, it was apparently honey mixed with herbs and the flavour was so strong I couldn&apos;t even drink it.





The Red Cross guy was apparantly at a bar a few minutes walk and in the main area still so I agreed to walk there to meet him and find out the information as I talked to him on Zimons phone and he was legitimate. We started walking along and randomly ran into my friends Jonas and Masri who I had met the other night. So random! In an area I had never been before and not near their area! I explained I was going to meet the Red Cross guy to get the info on the walk and they waited on the street corner as Zimon started to take me up a side street and into what looked like a house.... I was even more cautious as I was greeted by a girl wearing a traditional dress who ushered me into a lounge room as music started to play and about 5 girls arrived in traditional dress and started to dance. I angrily turned to Zimon and was like, &apos;what the hell?! Where is ash (the red cross guy), where is the bar and what am I doing here?!!!&apos; he tried to spin some story about the coffee house ( a traditional Ethiopian ceremony) raising money for children, but I was already on my feet, pushing past them all and out the door. He followed me proclaiming that now I needed to give them money to provide support for the children or some crap, but the door was already swinging closed in his face as I was outta there! Scam escaped! Score one for me! I was angry though and still never got the details on the red cross walk!





Jonas and Masri were waiting on the street as I stormed out, checking all my belongings. Check! All good to get outta there! The guys were heading to have some food so I joined them on the public Mikrolet where we then ate the traditional rubber millet bread again, but this time with two traditional meat dishes Claudio had told me to try- tebs, small chunks of meat with onion, and kitfo- minced meat with butter. They were okay.... But medium cooked minced meat that is still pink doesn&apos;t really do it for me. I shouldn&apos;t complain though as the Ethiopians usually eat their meat raw!





The Ethiopians also eat with their fingers and eat off each others hands as well- one person scoops it up in their fingers and then feeds it into a fellow diners mouth which I found to be a little bit too weird.







The restaurant / eating house- there was only really space for like 5 people, was quite cool though- located on Churchill road it themed itself and had pictures of various different US presidents and significant black leaders.







We then walked just across the road, down the street, and into a small room about 3m by 3m with benches around the edges and lots of seats outside. This was the local hmmm pub, I guess you could say! Called Timberland as there was a tree out the front similiar to the company logo of timberland, and the place is constructed from wood. It was run by a married couple with a 10 month old baby who lived in another room at the back of a similiar size with a young girl they were looking after. It was amazing and really made you see the differences between our lives and theirs.







The girl was from a rural town in a far away province and didn&apos;t speak Ahmeric. She had been made pregnant by her uncle at 13 and her baby had passed away 2 months later, and that was just 2 months ago. So sad. But commonplace unfortunately.  I didn&apos;t quite understand how she had come to be in Addis, but the family were now looking after her and she was helping with their baby and running the business.







I tried the traditional white spirit whose name I have forgotten amki or amri maybe? Which has a very very strong and not so nice taste! It is fermented underground in a giant barrell for 2 months before it is ready to drink. A guy then dropped around with beans ( like the ones in jack and the beanstalk- I have forgotten what they are called!) that were sprouting, covered them in spicy sauce, gave us a plastic bowl and some spoons and that was it! Bar snacks! :) quite tasty.







The family who owned the timberland were so sweet, they let me play with their son, thanked me for coming and made me dinner- the millet bread with a delicious bean sauce over it. So lovely!







One of the other locals there who was a friend of Jonas and Masri is an artist, and quite good- he has several pieces for sale in the main gallery on Bole Rd. He went home to get a small album with photos of his products, and then also gave me 4 basic prints,  2 on goat skin and 2 on wood with traditional scenes such as collecting water, grinding barley, the famous ethopian composer and one of the famous saints- Ethiopia is a very religious country.







We then headed back to Bole Rd to a club with live Ethiopian music, dancers who were quite amazing with the body part isolation moves they could do and singers. You also did not buy individual drinks, you just brought a bottle of alcohol of your choice, a bottle or 2 of mixer and they gave you a bucket of ice, and that was it! Dangerous!







As it would turn out later, luckily for me I made a decision to pretend to be drinking, and just tipped my drinks on the floor as I didn&apos;t want to not be in control in a random African country by night.  And never have I made a wiser decision.



And so... Just when I thought i had had an amazing time and Ethiopia was looking up.... I was wrong! I was getting tired and told the guys I was heading home. Jonas decided it was his duty to look after me, even though he, like the others was beyond drunk and had previously wanted to continue on. And so we had a small discussion/ argument as I was like &apos;i am going home to my place, nowhere else&apos; and he was agreeing, and so I got out my map and told the taxi driver where to go and then Jonas lived further up. The taxi driver and Jonas then started chatting in Ahmeric, and I heard what sounded like somewhere else. Trying to confirm what was going on, he kept trying to distract me but i called their bluff that we were going the wrong way and started yelling at them to take me home. I ordered the taxi driver to change direction immediately or stop the car, but the quality vehicles there are here, the door wouldn&apos;t open and I was trapped. But he wouldn&apos;t do either. To cut a long story short, obviously this isnt all the details, so dont form a judgement!  But yep, being kidnapped (?That&apos;s not the right word, but I can&apos;t think of it) and it may have been the scariest hour of my life- yes, hour- they were determined, but not as determined as I. In the end I won out and got to the main  road near where I lived, but the taxi driver wouldn&apos;t go in from where we were as the roads are really really dodgy. So bigger problem, Claudio told me I was NOT to walk there alone after dark. Great. Scared stupid, yes! So I paid the taxi driver, but he told Jonas he wanted more, which Jonas refused to pay. Cue massive argument and then fight, traffic stopping to get involved until it was broken up. Yep, me standing on the side of the road in the pitch black on the edge of the slums. Nice. At least there were lots of people around!  So in the situation, having no choice but having to trust someone to get me out of there as I was definitely not safe standing there, it had to be Jonas. And he had definitely had a wake up call with what had just happened.  &apos; I am going to get you home safe to Claudio&apos; he then said and two of the guys hanging around were like oh you are staying with Claudio! And Jonas is-see they are friends and with four of us we will be fine. To cut another long story short, the supposed &apos;friends&apos; were good at what they did!! In the space of just several hundred metres we had to cover, they managed to split us all up and then deliberately tried to take me on the wrong  road, which I was not having a bar of and started to get my phone hiding in my pocket ready to call for help and just hightailed it home, which was just 20m around the corner. I was then mugged, but I just instinctively started fighting and luckily all he got was my phone before I started screaming like there was no tomorrow and banging on Claudios gate til the neighbour came out, scared him off and then Shoa and Mario grabbed me inside. Holy crap! Definitely not the best night of my life!! I just re-read it and I can&apos;t portray properly in words how the night panned out, but trust me it was freaking scary!!! And i don&apos;t think it sounds it from above, as I don&apos;t want to relive it, but the mugging part was THE worst. THE worst experience ever.







Claudio was amazing, he was at the window, quickly opened the door and got me into his house, heard my story and stayed up til I was calm enough to head off to my room. &apos;You are really lucky he said.&apos; And don&apos;t I know it.

I was just so freaking lucky I wasn&apos;t drunk, that I had gotten my bearings and that I had taken notice of everywhere I went, that I reacted so quickly, was SO unwavingly confident in every action I took  and that I stayed totally in contol and kept my wits about me. My throat is sore, my grappling hand hurts and my other knuckles are really bruised from banging, but I am fine and all I lost was my phone, so am feeling unbelieveably lucky. Well relatively fine- I don&apos;t think I have ever been or will ever be this shaken up! :) Although, yes, of course I was absolutely kicking myself for getting into this position. But, truely, unless I stayed inside a bubble, that is the only sure fire way to prevent things happening. And what&apos;s the point in travelling then? I have been pretty lucky over the past three years. It was just a wake up call I guess, Africa is like nowhere else, and like I wrote in my last post- I stand by the fact that Africa is no place for a single White female. :) anyone who says otherwise has clearly never done it themselves. Just got to make the most of what I can. But yes, every day makes me more and more determined, to get me the hell out of Addis!! If only I didn&apos;t have commitments with the fistula hospital I would be long gone.


 
Get a cheap one this time eh! Addis, Ethiopia

2010-10-24

After taking literally hours to fall asleep as my heart was still pounding and I kept seeing the guys face when I closed my eyes and unintentionally recounting what happened, I was woken by a soft knock and mystique asking if I wanted eggs, ah so nice!







After trying unsuccessfully to straighten my fingers without pain I realised they were black and blue across the knuckles on one hand from smashing the gate, and just plain painful on the other from my grapple :). If that&apos;s the worst though I can&apos;t complain. I kept rethinking the things I could have done differently, but hey hindsight is a wonderful thing! And who knows if it would have made any difference anyway. A lesson i learnt though was next time i would definitely phone back to the house or for help sooner. I didn&apos;t because I didn&apos;t want to disturb them as it was late, and I didn&apos;t think the situitation was that bad and I could get out of it myself. But I realise it is easier to be cautious and apologise for waking them up then have something happen.  But anyway, in the words of Claudio, just time to learn and move on!







I actually felt better today than I had the entire time so far in Addis....maybe I subconsciously knew from everything horrible that was going on, something bad was going to happen and I was just waiting for it to be over. Who knows!







I had to laugh as I walked out of my room and the other male staff member, Mario, who speaks a bit of English waved me over. &apos;Next time get a cheap one eh!!!&apos; we both cracked up as we tried to piece together what had happened.







Shoa had apparantly heard a commotion outside and heard his phone ringing before I even started screaming, but he couldn&apos;t find itInge had beenbup just 5 mins before getting water ( it comes at odd times) and had been attacked by giant ants and had to strip off. In the dark he was desperately trying to find his trousers, but couldn&apos;t find them anywhere and was trying to pull on a shirt on his legs in his haste! And his phone was in his trouser pockets!! So he was rushing like crazy to get out there and save me and everything was going against him! Lucky he managed to sort it out quickly and he and Mario got there.







Shoa so kindly offered to take me to get a new phone and so a little hesitantly I left outside the safety of the gates. I was looking at everyone suspiciously through my sunglasses, but it is amazing how differently people treat you when you are with a local. No harassment at all! We took a different, longer way to the main road so I didn&apos;t have to go back the same way and then found out as it was Sunday the phone shop was closed! Undeterred, shoa flagged down a mikrolet public taxi and we headed to the piazza area, but there was nothing suitable there that was open. A few people came up to us and tried to sell us individual phones they had in their pockets and we just looked at each other and laughed- we know where those came from! Ahh thieves!!







We then caught another public taxi to the Merkato and although a lot were also closed we found a store with the cheapest nastiest one we could find and brought that - less than 30 USD.







Luckily I also had in a local sim at the time so my English one with credit was  back in my backpack at home, which meant the guy got a local sim, like  1 USD in credit, a super crappy old phone, no charger and all my phone numbers- the only thing that mattered, but they can easily be replaced. So if you are reading this, please send a MSG with your name to my UK number!! :) x







And..... It Turns out the new phone was even better than my old one :)







Welcome to Africa! :)









Back home, I decided to venture out by myself and walk down to get my hair braided. As there is a massive shortage of water and I was also soon to be trekking, I figured it was the easiest way to get around it! I probably wasn&apos;t in the best frame of mind to get it done, but wow, it was a ridiculously painful 2 hours and with no common language she also randomly started cutting chunks  out of my hair that didn&apos;t fit in properly. What the?????!!!! Not happy jan!! And I have a nasty feeling I am going to be bald in a month when I pull them out too from the amount of hair she pulled out. No thankyou!!!









I was snubbing everyone who came near me and had to sometimes resist the urge to scream at them to get lost when they just wouldn&apos;t give up. Not sure how long I will be able to surpress that urge for now though!









And home to rest. Thankgoodness. Safe again... For another day. :) claudio continued his amazingness and coming in to check on me, invited me up  to the house for dinner, to see the girls and chill out and watch some tv with him. So nice!! So glad it happened when I had the support of people around me!
 
Finally! A good day! Deste Mader, Fistula Village, Addis, Ethiopia

2010-10-25


Today was a good day! The first... And only day I have had in Ethiopia that I totally enjoyed!

...although if one more person that I sit next to on a bus, I buy water off in the supermarket or talks to me waiting to cross a road asks for my number or email and wants to catch up for coffee or a chat I will scream!


On the public taxi into the town I was putting on sunscreen as the man next to me watched curiously, finally plucking up the courage to ask in English what it was. He had never heard of sunscreen before! 


I had decided to get up early and head into the fistula hospital to figure out what was going on! When I had contacted the hospital about a possible visit, the person I had been in email contact with, Feven was super supportive. I had just asked to visit the hospital, but she said &apos;oh we will take you to the hospital, to Deste Mader, to the midwifery college and to an outpost station no problems!&apos; so I had been super excited about the plans and Feven had said I just needed 5 days in Ethiopia to see all of that and some of the country too, and that she would organise it all. I thought I might like some extra time, so organised 10 days and asked her to organise the hospital things for the first few days as they were my first priority so I would then be free to explore. just prior to arriving I hadn&apos;t heard a timetable so she said to come in at some stage my first full day there.


Which was the day I missed the visit to Deste Mader as she had arranged a car for 9am and didn&apos;t tell me. She then went away for 4 days and despite numerous phone calls and texts didn&apos;t answer about my timetable. So extremely frustrated with her and feeling I was wasting my time with nothing to do, sitting in a city I hated I decided to just go to the hospital the day I knew she was back, even though you are not supposed to be there without an appointment.


She was totally unconcerned about her lack of organisation and that I had just been sitting around waiting for her and asked about seeing the other things she had promised, to which she replied that there wasn&apos;t really enough time left to see anything but she could hire me a car and driver for about 150 USD a day to go up north but I would have to leave right then and that was my only option. I was so angry with her for wasting my time, promising all these things she clearly had no intention of delivering and then trying to make me pay a fortune!


But...moving on!!!! I successfully navigated several different minibus taxis to arrive right at the door of the fistula hospital! Even I didn&apos;t expect that! Score! :)


I was really expecting the Fistula Hospital to be the highlight of my trip, but although I still admire Dr Hamlin and the amazing things she has done/ is doing, there are definitely people letting her down! But I was soon to find out there were also people doing an equally amazing job.


Finally I organised a visit to Deste Mader, or Joy Village in Amheric, which was about 45 mins from the hospital. Although there is about a 95% rate fixing fistulas, there are about 2% of girls who cannot be cured sufficiently to return home due to life long care required from the hospital. Deste Mader is a rehabilitation and re-integration centre to provide attitude changing training to make them independant again, or train the girls as nurse aids. 


Here the women live together as a family and engage themselves in various farm activities. There are cows, chickens, goats, a vegetable garden and the facilities to process all these things. 


There is also a cafe called Juniper Cafe which is another means of generating income with catering training and cooking &apos;Australian pie&apos; for visitors on the weekends.


The land was donated by the government and used to be an old military camp. It is really beautifully set up with a lake, trees, beautiful gardens, views into the hills and well set up with all the facilities needed.


We spoke to some of the girls as we were walking around and they all seemed so young! They were all so happy and smiling and friendly though, it was so lovely to see.
 

Also on site is the Hamlin midwifery college. The first graduates completed their studies and graduated in early October this year, after 3 years of study. The pupils are found on a scholarship system and then sign an agreement to work in their locality for a certain number of years in order to reduce the possibility of fistulas and provide pregnancy support and natal care, which most areas do not have at all.


The college is really well set up with classrooms, whiteboards, ceiling mounted projecters, a library, computer room, models for the students to pratice and study with, dormatories for the students and everything they need. It is all done is English too and totally accredited. This is where my day improved even more! I met Amnette, the vice dean of the college who was an Australian midwife, and her husband was CEO of the hospital. I also met a few other Aussies who were midwives of English teachers there and they were all so lovely and welcoming and friendly, and telling me all about the place, it was absolutely my favourite time of anything in Ethiopia. They invited me for lunch and helped me plan out the rest of my time in Ethiopia, telling me there was time to see things and I didn&apos;t have to hire an expensive car, which was impossible. Amnette also offered me a couch at her place which was so lovely after hearing about the awful timebi was having in Addis. I was sad to leave these amazing friendly women and the amazing job they are doing in the college, for women and for Ethiopia.


It had definitely made my day seeing Deste Mader, the midwife college and the staff there and gave me back my motivation!
  

I also found out that most of the patients in the hospital are from 12-13 years up, but there have also been 7 year olds, all the way up to elderly women. How sad is that!!!!



Quite proud of myself i again successfully navigated home without being accousted or ripped off, and as I walked back up the dirt roads to Claudios home I had to move aside for a police car coming through. It then beeped at me, the driver waved and I realised it was Claudio! There were police in the other seats! He was taking the police out for patrols in the area afterwhat had happened to me! How cool is that!


I spent the afternoon playing with his two girls, Jada and Ilaria, who are really lovely, before getting ready for my next adventure!   



I also had to laugh at my brother when I told him that I had been mugged, as the first thing he asked was &apos; did they let you keep your sim?&apos; the image of me bargaining with my mugger as he was attacking me to take my phone apart and return my sim was too funny! Valid point though I guess as I was still using my uk sim in my new phone as I had a local one in at the time.


Oh and something else i have noticed... Ethopian children are soo cute! They are all so happy and friendly it is awesome. The girls are all also beautiful and take great pride in their appearance with the hair always beautifully done and are well dressed.

 
Escape! North to Bahir Dar, the public bus from hell, more dodgy locals holding my bag for ransom an

2010-10-26

I was up by half past four and super excited to be getting out of Addis! Claudio had recommended another taxi driver, one who parks his car in his locked compound overnight so I was interested to see whether this one would rip off too!! He arrived late as Shoa and I stood waiting and then had to fill up the water before he, Shoa and a random who had turned up pushed the car into about a 9 point turn to get it outside the gate. Odd, till I heard him attempt to start it up as it took about 5 or 6 attempts and definitely have woken the entire house! We drove close to Merkato, to the main bus terminal, as he charged me 100 Birr, and then proceeded to smile and thank me as I just looked at him in disdain hoping he could read the look on my face in the dark - &apos;i know you are ripping me off so you had better stop that now!!!&apos;





It was chaos!!!!!! There were literally thousands of people everywhere, and as Shoa attempted to walk through, people were grabbing me and calling me &apos;their special girl&apos; as I threw elbows out hoping to connect with whoever deserved them most! It was so crazy it took us a while to push through the hordes and to find the right ticket seller out if the hundreds there, but we finally achieved it and lined up to get inside the gates to where the buses were parked. There was a massive crush of randoms and only ticket holders were allowed through. Inside it was equally as chaotic with people and buses everywhere. I have no idea how Shoa managed to find the right bus, but I was do glad he was there as both the dark and people still terrified me, my heart was pounding at a million miles an hour and I don&apos;t know if I would have been able to do it myself.





I got inside and took a seat, it was one of those party buses that people hang all over the outside of, tinsel and flowers and all kinds of decorations across the front and the bags tied onto the roof. And inside, just like a school bus! Rows of hard upright bench seats. Comfy!!!





We were due to depart at 6, but it was almost 8 by the time we hit the road. I had read that the reason the buses leave do early is so that they only havevto drive in daylight as once night falls, roadblacks are often set up and the buses hijacked and robbed. Lovely!



People arrived with empty plastic jerry cans, plastic washing tub things, bizarre, and no luggage, even though the trip was going to be at least 12 hours and they would have to stay the night in their destination.





We had only been driving for 10 mins when the bus pulled up and stopped as everyone immediately jumped up and started pushing for the exit. I looked around bewildered?? Was the bus going to explode or something?? I saw the guy that was sitting opposite me earlier gesturing madly, &apos;come, come!!&apos; I quickly exited and followed the crowd... Onto another bus!! The rush must have been to get a &apos;good&apos; seat. Clearly impossible! :) but unfortunately in my haste I had dropped my ticket, the bus had left and the guy collecting them made me buy a new one, even though it had already been checked about 7 times to get onside, to get on the bus, to have a seat, to put my bag on top... Which I also had another ticket for, but no. Ahhh Not much you can do when you can&apos;t speak the language!





And finally we were truly underway, choking on dust and fumes that filled the cabin from open windows. Not nice!

It was over 4/1/2 hours after I first got on the bus til our first stop... Well, if you count pulling up on the side of the road for 5 minutes,  everyone jumping out to pee right then and there by the side of the bus on the flat ground- girls included. I decided to cross my fingers and wait for the next stop! Luckily it was lunch and there were toilets. You could smell them from a mile away. So gross! I joined the mixed que for the squatters as I watched everyone roll up their trousers as to keep them clean. Gross! And double gross they didn&apos;t have running water so there was a drum at the entrance with a scoop and not when you finished, but before you went in, you picked up the bucket and washed the other persons mess away! No sinks or toilet paper of course, and triple gross people having to wipe down their shoes when they exited. Yuk!







The music was a strange mix of bollywood with panflutes and jazz. Not so bad, until I realised it was the same cassette?? On repeat. 14 hours :).





It was weird, every time we stopped, they would let beggars and preachers and people selling stuff on to walk down the aisle and try and get money off us!!







The drive was actually really beautiful, once we got outside the tin shed shanty towns if Addis, most of the houses were more spacious and built of mud brick instead. It was quite nice to sit there and whiz through a brief look at their lives! We saw lots of people farming, kids as young as about 5 herding animals, people playing table tennis in the streets, and people walking as far as the eye could see over the fields.





The countryside was stunning in parts, especially the MASSIVE blue Nile Gorge, rivers, waterfalls, rock formations and loyd of green farmlands. Not so fun was the road down to the gorge which took us hours to navigate as it was so steep, and both dirt and potholed in parts.







After lunch it really started to warm up. We were packed in like sardines, there was no aircon or fans, the windows couldnt be opened or we choked on fumes and dust and it was Soooooooooooo hot. So nasty everyone sitting there in a pool of their own sweat and dehydrating to death. Yuk.

If only it wasn&apos;t so rattling and bumpy we might have been able to sleep!!







We had been going for quite a few hours and were clearly behind schedule when we came across an identical bus parked up at the side of the road with a flat tire. The passengers all ran towards us to try and get on our bus, but luckily they wouldn&apos;t let them! So lucky that wan&apos;t our bus! I thought I spoke too soon though as suddenly we veered, swerved drastically and then came to an abrupt halt. &apos; There&apos;s been an accident&apos; someone told me  as all the males on the bus ran to get off as I was told to stay. We were there for at least 20 mins and I wondered what had happened. Turns out we had hit a sheep. Yes, a sheep!!! I have no idea what they were doing for do long crowded around it?? CPR??!!! :) weird.







It was starting to get dark as the co driver turned around and yelled something which then had the entire bus in an uproar. Apparantly the driver was tired and was going to park up for the night in the next town!!!!! What the??!! and we were only about 50 kms out, after having already come about 500..... In over 12 hours!!! I had heard this often happened, but was still hoping it didn&apos;t happen as we pulled up in the next tiny village.... And then kept going. And thankgoodness as I didn&apos;t see a single hotel and I wasn&apos;t about to get mugged again!!







Part way along the guy I was sitting next to got off and was replaced by some other guy who just wanted to chat. Now I am well over chatting to random people I meet for the reasons in all my previous posts and I was just willing him to shut up! Out of all the people on the bus, the one person who speaks English was next to me!!!







Even my disinterested sighs, looking out the window and not contributing didn&apos;t faze him. Until he asked something like what do you think of Ethiopia being a foreigner here? I looked sideways at him, judged the intelligence of the question and began. I told that you are constantly harassed, everyone who talks to you has some kind of agenda and wants something from you, everyone tries to rip you off all the time, people try and use scams on you, taxi drivers always take you for a ride and overcharge, you get mugged.... Just to name a few! He was a little shocked,  but took it well and it also had the desired effect of halting the conversation, although it didn&apos;t stop him trying to get my email address before we got off! Turns out he wants assylum in Australia. Surprise surprise!







We finally pulled into Bahir Dar in the pitch black about 8pm, 2 hours behind schedule, but not really bad considering! Of course I was a little bit petrified as I watched the hordes if male gangs accumulating at the bus stop and was dreading going out into it! Damn arriving in the dark!!! Due to the haste of my plans and the fact it wasn&apos;t peak season.... (If there is such a thing in Ethiopia! ) I figured I could easy get accomodation in one of the places listed in the lonely planet guidebook. I probably should mention that it is 15 years old and lists countries that don&apos;t exist anymore, but I did get it for one Swiss franc! Bargain!!! I picked a suitable one and asked the guy next to me how much it would cost in a taxi. &apos;Oh it&apos;s close&apos; he said &apos;you can walk!&apos; I reminded him of the Ethiopian pasttime of mugging. 15 Birr he answered.&apos; &apos;okay&apos;, I said &apos;we shall see!!!!&apos;







Waiting for them to pull the dust covered bags down off the top of the bus, a taxi driver came and started harassing me, trying to carry my day pack as I ripped it away from him. The guy next to me had a chat to him and he said he was fine to go with and we would drop me off and then him off which I was none too happy about being in a taxi with 3 locals, but it was either that or face the street alone! The bags were slow in coming off and so the taxi driver climbed up to help. He grabbed my backpack off the ticket guy and started to come down the stairs when he skipped and fell the whole way to the ground!!!!! Wow!!!! I thought fit sure he would have broken his back, but my backpack must have taken the brunt of it as he was fine. At least it gave me time to get my bags on so no one could run away with them anyway!!!!







We got into the little 3 wheel taxis they have instead of regular cars and literally just drove down the street and around the corner to the blue Nile hotel. I was after the blue Nile springs hotel, but this was avreslly nice one with a concierge and I figured I could get out of the taxi and would be safer in there than anywhere else! The driver immediately said 35 Birr at which point I looked directly at the guy from the bus who told me it would be 15 with a massive &apos;i told you so look&apos; on my face. He looked a little shocked and told me just to pay 15 and get out which I did, but meanwhile the guy who had fallen from the bus with my bag (there was both him and the driver in the taxi) had taken the opportunity to take my bag. Luckily for me and stupidly for him he had carried it right near some of the hotel staff. As I walked over he just said something like &apos;for me&apos;. I knew this was going to turn bad and I just went &apos;what are you talking about&apos; &apos;tip&apos; he said. To which I replied &apos;no way&apos;. He then proceeded to hold my bag for ransom and go off about how I owed him 200 Birr and how he had been injured because of me and blah blah blah! I was so angry and just yelled at him &apos;no! I did not ask you to do any of those things&apos; and then turned to the staff and sweetly said &apos; can you please help me. I do not know this man and he is bothering me.&apos; At which point one was clearly waiting to get involved and started yelling at him in Ahmeric, but he still wouldn&apos;t give up! He Finally stormed off and left my bag. Every day I hate this country home!







The guy behind reception clearly knew I didn&apos;t have a reservation and was not going to be staying in a luxury-ish hotel like that so he just amiled as I said &apos;they brought me to the wrong place but I just wanted to get away and somewhere safe!&apos; he then called the hotel I wanted, but the cheapest rooms were full and I wasn&apos;t sure if I could face another taxi today so he recommended the hotel next door- &apos;cheap and safe!&apos;







They looked after my stuff as I hurried to check it out, confirmed it all locked up, and it had a shower!!!! Just cold water, but beggars can&apos;t be choosers! :) Sure it wasnt pretty, but within 5 mins i could be safe. not bad for 100 Birr!







And now I am writing this sitting in my super hot room in the Pension Hotel and getting covered and bitten by various bug life. Yuck. there is no way I am opening the window to let air in cause who knows what else will happen! It is pretty dodgy too, you don&apos;t have to give your name or anything when you check in. No wonder they can never trace people who disappear...!







So, Ethiopia, the first country in all my travels to have ever claimed this honour - my least favourite place in the world!!
 
Tourist traps on lake tana, and the beautiful Tissisat falls - source of the Blue Nile. Bahir Dar, E

2010-10-27

After a night being bitten to death and crawled over by every insect there is, I was ready to get out of there! I left the hotel and began to walk towards the main road where I believed the better hotels to be.the Internet had proved fruitless and nobody could provide me with map! I came across the Ghion hotel that I had read good things about for travelers and was apparantly good value, but their cheapest room was triple what I was paying, and I would have to brave the streets with my backpack again, or even worse a taxi. There were a lot of other travelers around, mostly older people and some with early teenage children and tours being organised everywhere. I asked about the lake monasteries and the blue Nile falls, the famous sites in the region. About 800 by yourself, but about 350 with a group, so tried to join in on a group, there was one for the monasteries in the morning and falls in the afternoon. Perfect! Except I had 20 mins to get back, find a hotel, change hotels, get to the bus station , buy a ticket and return for the tour! I found out there were 2 private bus companies that ran the route to Addis, Sky bus (350) and Salam (200) so I didn&apos;t have to catch the public bus again.  The hotel guy got me a taxi for 1 Birr to the station, i brought a ticket on Salam, attempted to find a hotel super close by so it would be easy to get there in the morning, and failed dismally! I was constantly harassed and followed and ready to kill someone I gave up and went back to my hotel to pay for another night. I figured it was close enough, and right next door to the nice hotel so if I had any problems I could just go in there.







Bahir dar is definitely the pick over Addis though - skip the dirty, crowded unsafe capital for the rest of the country anyday. Compared to Addis, Bahir Dar is a thousand times less dirty, crowded, polluted and has a much nicer feeling to it, not to mention pretty scenery surrounding it and things to do and see! It is also more of a snapshot of traditional Africa as you see everyone in traditional clothes, doing their day to day activities as they would have done for hundreds of years.





I made it back to the Ghion in time and joined 3 people from Belgium on the small rickety motor boat on lake Tana. Lake Tana is the origin of the Blue Nile, the White Nile originates in Lake Victoria and the two rivers merge into the Nile proper in Sudan.







The Lake is 75 km long, 60km wide and is dotted with over 30 islands, most of which are monasteries from the 14th century. But, it is really quite ugly! All you can see from the shore is an expanse of muddy brown water, no blue Nile here!!!!! And that is it! Even from the boat on the water it is all still quite meh. We pulled up to the first island, a long boring 45 minute boat ride and then had to pay another 50 birr to gain access. And so not worth it. A very small island, small museum and a very small round monastery with religious paintings inside. That&apos;s all. Entons Eyesose. Skip it! There was a semi nice view with the foilage out to another close by island, but I could live without seeing that!







We then had another long boring 45 min motor to Zighe (zegie)  island where we walked up a cool little jungle path for 15 mins, even if there were local sellers hassling us from each side. We arrived at Ura-Kidane-mereth monastery, handed over another 50 Birr and saw another, but slightly larger round building with religious paintings inside. Apparantly it is quite significant, but I didn&apos;t get much out of it. There were rocks that were used as bells for calling, drums for chanting and praying that were quite cool, but that was it. We then had over an hours... Yep, long and boring! motor back to the Ghion hotel, leaving me decided that it was a waste of time and money, just another tourist trap, another way Ethiopia could annoy you and rip you off!







The Ghion had a beautiful garden with hornbills, flowers, massive shady trees, a view out to the lake and a restaurant and bar which was quite nice so  I settled in for a traditional lunch with the traditional rubbery grey pancake bread, injera and all sorts of vegetarian sauces and salad and veg on top which was tasty and so nice seeing as it had been some time since I had seen veg or anything other than carbohydrates really!!







From lake tana, the blue Nile thunders 50m over the 400m wide cascading falls of Tissisat, 30 km - an hours drive along crappy dirt tracks from Bahir Dar!







I was with a group of 3 older UK teachers who were working in Addis. It was a really cool drive, watching the locals go about their day to day business, farming, herding animals, walking with water or stores on their heads and seeing all the local communities. As we pulled up to get tickets a crazy man ran at the car and threw a cup of water at it as we turned out the way and got showered through the open window. Gross! He continued waving his arms, screaming, threatening small children with his stick and following me until he was herded away.







We drove a further km and embarked on foot. It was so picturesque with the beautiful green surroundings, trees and flowers. As the Blue Nile came into view we saw the first ever bridge over the Nile, the 17th century Portuguese bridge which for the first time ever gave tribes on either side of the river access across!! Amazing!







There was a procession of local children heading home from school across the mountains- up to a 2 hour walk there and the same back! Other children spent the entire walk following us, each one saying exactlyvthe same thing - &apos;hello, what is your name?&apos; &apos;that&apos;s a nice name. My name is .... You remember my name and buy scarf on your way back&apos;. We heard this tirade a dozen times as we approached the falls, but it was worth it. They were spactacular!!!!!







We were standing on the opposite bank and slightly above the falls with the most amazing view of the water thundering down, the mist rising up and the sound of the water falling! It is hard to describe, but they are definitely stunning and the most beautiful thing I have seen in a while!!







Driving home in the dark was not fun though, as we all held on for dear life as we bumped our way too fast along the crappy roads and back to the Ghion. We sat in the rotunda overlooking lake tana and enjoyed dinner before it was time to brave the dark hone, but success home safe and sound! A good day! Finally! Well half a day, but ill still count it. That makes..... Um..., 2 out of about 10! Not good odds Ethiopia! :)







So I have now figured out the way to travel Ethiopia that every other traveler appears to be doing. Spend money! Step 1- go in groups!!! :) Then spend money :). Stay at nice hotels, spend your time in their grounds, eat there also and pay for tours and buses out of there with everything organised for you.  Sure, it&apos;s not seeing the real Ethiopia, but I am testiment to the fact you don&apos;t want to do that!!!
 
Safety! And Almost 3 months in bowling shoes! Bahir Dar to Addis, Ethiopia

2010-10-28 to 2010-10-29

A few more bugs bites, no running water and creeping past the reception guy sleeping on a stretcher at the front of my hotel, Betel Pension I was out into the dark.







I had been assured by several people I had asked that I would be fine walking from my hotel around the corner to the bus station at 0445 in the morning, &apos;not mugged&apos;, they said, &apos; just harassed&apos;. So situation normal, I long for the day I can walk somewhere without being harassed! And yup. Non stop people trying to take me to Addis or Gondar or just be plain annoying, but  nothing else.







The Salam bus was much newer than every other bus in the compound, say from 1960 :) and there was a sort of queue waiting for a guy in a suit to tag the bags. Bliss! I checked my bag, watched it be lifted on top and then joined the queue to be frisked to enter the bus. And seats!!! Real seats!!!! I was SO happy and settled in comfortably. About an hour in we were woken and given a juice and biscuit for breakfast. AND seatbelts!!!!! Luxury!!







Our first service stop was a place with trees and bushes so there was actually a place to go to the toilet! And unlike previously where everyone just went right there, this was a totally different class of people who spread out found trees and got away from everyone. A nice change!







AND then an African MTV video was put on the tv!!! it was awesome! The clips left a little to be desired though, blue screens and the artist just changing shirts a few times! Hilarious :)





It was such a more pleasant journey than the public bus! The lunch stop was nicer too... Although the toilets I unfortunately chose to use at one of the hotel restaurants had pop wiped all over the walls as there is never any toilet paper. Yup, SO gross!!!





We got into Addis in just over 11 hours which was nice, especially considering we had had to stop for about 45 mins at one stage to change a tyre. As my backpack was lifted off the top of the bus I was then surrounded by staff demanding money. So annoying! Then one tried to take my bag away saying taxi, taxi! So I just forcibly grabbed it back and decided I didn&apos;t trust any of them and would rather take my chances walking! Good decision actually, so much less traumatic! I somehow figured out the way to walk to Mexico square where the mini buses to the fistula hospital leave from, but unfortunately by this time it was peak hour and they were all so jam packed not everyone could get on, letalone me with a backpack!





I dragged my feet toward the taxi compound and reluctantly asked for one to the fistula hospital. A guy came forward, explained in perfect english that the mainvroad in was closed due to improvement works, but he could take me around the other way for 70birr, which was totally a normal price! I was so shocked and told him so as we were driving and he shook his head and said how angry he was when people charged a difference price and tried to rip off foreigners. He explained that he thought they were only thinking of themselves at the moment on time because they might get their money then, but the people aren&apos;t going to use a taxi again, and they are going to go home and tell everyone about their experience and then no one would return to Addis. Whereas he thought ahead and if he charged a normal price people would continue to use his services, tell their friends positive stories, and as a result others may come and he would therefore have work in the future.  Good philosophy hey!!!





I arrived at the house of Annette, and Mark and their teenage kids Alleytia, Lucas, Martin and Dylan and they all welcomed me with open arms, and sat me down to a delicious Asian dinner Mark had cooked. We chatted and watched a movie and it was awesome. And a hot shower and a real bed! Luxury!!! Definitely my favourite time in Ethiopia  so far!! The next morning after a delicious breadfast with.... Cereal!!! We walked up to a local shopping centre so the boys could get their hair cut and we all sat down for a juice at the local coffee chain, whose logo looks exactly the same as starbucks, the same colours and similiar shop setup! I had a mixed juice which was layers of mango, guava and advocado! Not so sure how well they all go together, but pretty to look at and interesting to try!







That evening we all headed out to the local bowling centre and had a few games, it was heaps of fun! I am not sure if the lanes were crooked or we all just bowled really badly and to the left! :) Apparantly it is also the only automated centre in Addis, the remainder are all manual, you write your own scores and there is a guy sitting at the end of the lane who sets up the pins each time!!







As we were leaving we all walked out before someone said something, we looked down and all still had our bowling shoes on! Oops!! That would have been nasty trying to climb kilimanjaro and spend the next 3 months in clown shoes!! we had a delicious pizza dinner before all too soon it was time to go to the airport, where the guys kindly offered to drop me. The past 2 days were without a doubt my favourite part of the trip so far and I learnt how it was possible to enjoy myself on Ethiopia. I can&apos;t say thankyou enough for taking me in off the street and looking after me!!! Amazing!
 
To Kilimanjaro!!!! Ethiopia to Tanzania

2010-10-30 to 2010-10-31

I had to show my passport and tickets as I exited the carpark to Addis Airport and then had to join a queue to get everything scanned before I could enter the building. It was a little crazy, every man and his dig appeared to be there and randomly sprawled out on the floor inside like it was prayer time. I finally got to check in, got through departures and discovered, Wow Addis airport is a rip off!  Things inside were literally at least 3 x more expensive than they were outside, and often up to 6 or 10 times more. Disgusting! Not the best preperation  in the world I will admit, but would you believe budget flights? :)





After 3 gate changes, I boarded and was off to Nairobi about half past midnight. We arrived in about 4am, and the airport definitely leaves a bit to be desired, with it&apos;s lack of seating, and dirty, cold, hard tiled floors that there were people stretched out on every available surface. I found a spare and relatively quiet spot behind information and attempted to get some sleep. At about 9am I started wandering, it is just one straight line of almost identical duty free stores and nothing more. I sat on the floor outside the gate the screen indicated I was boarding at and waited... And waited... And waited, about 10 mins after my boarding time and no sign of movement, I decided to go for a wander and found a kilimanjaro gate under another provider, &apos;Precision Air&apos; who I asked where the Kenya Airways flight should be, at which point they started yelling &apos;Karina we are about to offload your bag, hurry up!!!&apos; I was ushered through and ran across the tarmac wondering how everyone else had managed, but found one of those mini planes with about 6 locals on it and that was it! It was just 50 mins  to Kilimanjaro and we passes the mountain!!! But unfortunately it was covered in clouds and we couldn&apos;t see anything!







I arrived on my little cropbduster plane into Kilimanjaro airport, Tanzania and walked across the runway to the small hut where we had to pass the &apos;health&apos; desk and prove we had had our yellow fever vaccinations to continue. Next stop was filling out forms and paying for the visa. 50USD! Ouch! Then across the other side of the room was the processing desk where you stood about 15cm from a web cam, were made to give a &apos;little smile&apos;, (which he made me redo as mine wasn&apos;t good enough!) and then he prints out your visa, sticks it in and you can just waltz straight past immigration to baggage claim. There were only 2 of us doing this process, and it took over 20 mind, so painful with a full plane I would imagine!!





Already I liked Tanzania as I exited eithout anyone trying to grab me, harass me or force me into a taxi! I just met my company rep, got sone cash and away we went!





It was so nice and normal! We drove in our air con 4wd about 50 mins to the town of Moshi and out the other side to the Springlands Hotel where my trek left from. Everyone was so freaking nice I was suspicious, I havnt figured out yet if they are just genuinely nice or are all after tips as that his how the economy here apparantly operates!!





Checking in I was told that it was just me doing the trek! I was not very happy as I had told them I was flexible and had been asked to be placed with a group, and with no sleep as well to add to the mix I was not a happy camper! I couldn&apos;t imagine spending the next 7 days climbing the highest freestanding mountain in the world alone!!





Several hours later i  answered a knock at the door and it was Joram, the guy from Zara tours (www.zaratours.com ) who I had been in contact with via email asking whether I could climb the next day and join a group instead as it was their charity &apos;clean up the mountain&apos; hike that they do at the end of peak season each year. I tried to contact my friend Matt who I was to be staying with after the trek, but unable to catch him I joined the group. Well, actually in the end I had no choice anyway! They moved all climbers from the 6 day route to the 7 day route and anyone either side got moved to that date. Surprise!



I went downstairs to meet Kate from Maine, USA, the first girl who had arrived and we chatted and had dinner which was nice as we were both travelling alone and every other meal they just sat you by yourself!





The next morning we met for breakfast and then met Yassin who walked us around to the Kilimanjaro Orphanage Centre which was just about 10 mins away. The centre was amazing. The kids all lined up, sung us the cutest welcome and introduced themselves in English. There were 31 kids there and another 11 out doing various things, like the Muslim children at the mosque. They were all so clean, well looked after and happy, it was so lovely. The staff there work so hard too! The government gives them no money at all- everything is funded entirely by donations (including the staffs wages); and volunteers and the local community helping out, which they do, dropping things off or coming in to help -they see it as their responsibility also which is really nice. Sometimes when there isn&apos;t enough money and no one has given any food, the teachers dig into their ownnpockets to make sure the children are fed and looked after.





There is one L shaped building with a covered walkway and rooms coming off it, and another for an ammenities block. There are 3 dormiteries with 2x sets of 3 bunk beds where the kids sleep 2 to a bed, but sometimes 3 if they are really full. There is a small kitchen, a store room, classroom and a yard, and that is it!





The kids were mainly young, from about 3 years, lots of 4 year olds, lots of 7 year olds all the way up to a 17 year old girl.





The older girls were all ironing all the childrens uniforms so they would look exactly like every other child at school, isn&apos;t that so awesome!





The children are all so enthusiastic, loving, friendly and polite, coming in for hugs and games. They are so cute!! Kate and I wanted to help and asked for some jobs to do as there is just too much for the staff to manage and they pointed us in the way of a massive tub of laundry!





Apparantly there wasn&apos;t much there today so we were lucky! Still it took us over 2 hours for the 2 of us and 1 staff member to fill the tub with buckets, manually scrub each article of clothing, rinse them and hang them all on the strung up lines. That chore must be never ending! Imagine if there was just one staff member washing - 6 hours work!!!!





And our hands were red raw from trying to get all the dirt out, but we felt like we had actually helped do that was awesome. We finished just as the kids were to eat lunch as they patiently waited their turn, all extra patiently sat until each one of them had received their meal, said grace together and then ate. How good are those kids! I know quite a few kids that could learn a thing or two off them!!! They them thanked the teachers, thanke us for coming out and were so sweet!





We walked back, had another delicious lunch - The food at the zara tours hotel -Springlands Hotel - was also delicious! And lots of variety... But I learnt to ask what everything was though as I was making polite chitchat at lunch with the steward and found out the meat I was about to place on my plate was liver. No thank you!!





We then met two other girls whose tours had been swapped to join our hike - 2 x Helens, and both from Putney in London! And so caught the Hotel taxi into Moshi together. It is a pretty small one street town, and here people still harass you to buy their wares, but no where near as bad as Ethiopia!! There, on the street, we ran into a guy  looking to climb Kili on our route the next day and got him on board, a guy named Robbie, from Dublin, Ireland. We were followed around the whole time by a guide who we asked several times to leave us alone, who then asked for a tip for guiding us! The cheek!





At 5pm we arrived ready and excited for our pre departure briefing and met John and Keith, 2 Canadians from Vancouver who had also been moved to our hike, so a cool mix of people! We learnt that it was going to be freaking hard, the altitude would hurt us, we had to eat lots, drink lots and&apos;walk like a champion&apos; to get to the top!





We hired the extra items we needed, packed our rucksacks and were ready!!!



Between vitamins, doxy for malaria, diamox for altitude, and a thousand other thing we had to bring, I felt like a walking drugstore! Better safe than sorry though!
 
Climbing Mt Kilimanjaro, Tanzania to raise funds for Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, Ethiopia

2010-10-31 to 2010-11-11

I am off to Africa tomorrow!!!!! I will try and update as much as I can, but not sure on the connextivity. As usual I am up to another crazy :-) Off to couchsurf! Wish me luck :-) !!!! -



Mount Kilimanjaro is located three degrees south of the equator in Northeastern Tanzania. It is the tallest mountain in Africa, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. Rising to an altitude of 5895m above mean sea level, it is also the 4th most prominent mountain in the world.



On the 01-07 Nov 2010, I will be climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia.



Founded by Australian Drs. Reginald and Catherine Hamlin, both obstetrician/gynaecologists, in 1974 the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital (http://www.hamlinfistula.org/) provides care for women obstetric fistulas‐ the most devastating of all childbirth injuries, wreaking a catastrophic effects on the sufferers, and a lifetime of incapacity and degradation.



The Hospital has a success/cure rate of over 90% and is a major teaching institution for gynecologists from all over the developing world and the team of dedicated staff have successfully operated on over 30,000 women, allowing them to again live in the communities they were once ostracised from.



Dr Catherine Hamlin still operates here today at the age of 84.



To learn more about fistula or to donate, please go to http://www.hamlinfistula.org.au/events.html - you will see at the bottom of the page information about my climb, and you can click on the link to take you to the payment page. Alternatively you can phone the office on (02) 8007 7435. PLEASE reference your donation with &apos;KARINYA CLIMB&apos;!



For those that are wondering how I heard about this amazing place - a fellow traveler! A girl named Melanie who i took on my Battlefield tour at the Western Front for ANZAC day this year told me about a book Dr Hamlin had written called &apos;The Hospital by the River&apos; and then met me at the station the next day to give me a copy. How lovely is that! After reading her inspiring story of dedicating her entire life to this cause I wanted to do something to help, as the hospital relies entirely on donations to exist.



I will also visit the hospital and outreach clinics whilst I am in Ethiopia.



I also have a flyer I made up that this site won&apos;t let me upload if anyone would like it to put up at their work or community group or local shopping centre, or where ever!! Please let me know your email address and I will send it through!!!



Thankyou!!!! x
 
Climbing Mt Kilimanjaro!!!! Day 1, others Tbc!

2010-11-01 to 2010-11-07

Day 1, Moshi 950 AMSL - Machame camp 3000AMSL





Excited, we were up for breakfast, finished packing and time to meet!!! There were now 8 of us all together with the addition of Melanie from the USA who had arrived late the previous evening.





We packed into the bus like cattle with all the hikers, porters and guides so quite a funny journey to Machame Gate 1828 Amsl to begin!





We all signed in the visitors book, got our packed lunch and a garbage bag for picking up rubbish on the way asbpart of our &apos;clean up the mountain&apos; hike.





After a photo at Machame Gate we became excited as we started off, pole pole!! The guides called to us, slowly slowly in Swahili!!! It was 1120h as we began, watching monkeys swinging in the trees and already it was a steep uphill climb! There was an older German couple also climbing and they helped us pick up rubbish along the way. There was not heaps, but still pretty disappointing people were just throwing it down from just 20m from the start. And mainly lolly wrappers too!





There were a few toilet huts with holes in the ground and foot rests which was handy, but not much else infrastructure wise!





And as we sat down to lunch.... The heavens opened! We pulled on our waterproofs and continued regardless through the pouring rain as we walked up and up and up and up hundreds of stairs cut into the dirt ond over tree trunks. It was really quite pretty, just wet and really cold if you stopped!





I must have been walking fast or the porters loads were ridiculously heavy and bulky (most likely!:)) as I overtook several of them. They were carrying sacks on their heads!!!! Crazy!!!





The vegetation started to change as we rose higher with different interesting plants around us and before we knew it someone was telling us we had made it and we were at camp!





We laughed, thinking it was a joke as it was only half past 4, but we were really there! It was hard, but we still felt really good... But could not wait to get our soaking wet clothes off!





The rain eased up as the crew prepared is hot drinks, sugar coated popcorn?! (this was the beginning of learning about the local obsession with sugar!) it was nice though :), hot water for washing and then set up inside the dining tent place settings for dinner! We hadva delicious steaming hot cucumber soup, followed by wedges, a vegetable curry, side of cabbage and then bananas for dessert. So nice!!





Except that it was SO cold. And just day 1!! It was maybe 25&apos; in Moshi, and now we had on thermals, fleeces, beanies, neckwarmers and were still cold! Oh oh!





We got our briefing fir the next day, told to keep drinking... 1.5L overnight should be enough???!!!!!! What the??!!! Between drinking and toilet stops you would never sleep!





And after queueing for our little toilet in a tent they set up for us  we were off to bed - yup, one of the porters had to carry and look after a toilet! That must be the worst job for sure!!!





Inside our tents and trying to get warm to sleep and it was only 8pm! Fingers crossed for no rain tomorrow as we all desperately needed all our stuff to dry before it got any colder!!!
 
Day 2 kili. Machame Camp 3000AMSL to Shira Camp 3800AMSL.

2010-11-02

Day 2 kili. Machame Camp 3000AMSL to Shira Camp 3800AMSL.

0840h-1400h= 5 1/2



After a cold night, trying to unsuccessfully dry out our wet clothes in our sleeping bags, others hanging and dripping on us, wet mattresses and having to get up, get shoes on, get extra clothes on and go outside in the cold to pee we were quite glad when it was time to get up, even if we didn&apos;t want to get out of the warmth of our sleeping bags!





A hot tub of water was delivered for us to wash and as we emerged we realised the skies were clear! Yay!!! I got my first glimpse of the peak of Kili!!!!





We sat down in our dining tent to a breakfast of bread (which we see the porters climbing with, tied to their loads on the outside so it doesn&apos;t get squashed!), local brown but delicious porridge, spreads, omelettes, mini sausages, banana, cucumber and tomato!! A feast!





We had all draped our clothes all over the trees like a gypsy camp as we ate and they were semi dry as we put them on or packed them away! Yay!







We started out warm and happy as the sun almost shone.... But as we walked, it got colder and colder as we added thermals and then the not so comfortable to hike in waterproof tops and pants.... Or not so waterproof as the case turned out to be!!





There were many steep and high stairs, uneven rocky ground, walking up slabs of rock and then some rock climbing! Yup, for real, with a massive drop off the side! So much fun! But it would have been more fun if it wasn&apos;t so wet and slippery and we wern&apos;t in super uncomfortable wet weather gear!





The terrain changed again to Moorland shubbery and the mist continued to roll in around us.





A lot of the porters had radios they carried too so we could bop along to music along the way! So cool!





It was kind of frustrating going &apos;pole pole&apos; (slowly slowly) in order to acclimatise, but by the end of the day we were in such a rush to get to camp before the heavy rain set in, it was fine!! :)





We arrived into Shira Camp at about 2pm and headed straight into our dining tent for lunch; carrot soup, French toast and bananas! We all started to rehydrate with the hot water they brought us as the rain set in and we were stuck in the tent, doing tag team to the toilet with all the water we were being told to drink!





Keith made the mistake of looking into his drink bottle of water the crew had provided and literally found a whole handful of dirt!





We all laughed so hard until we looked into the bottles we were drinking from and found the same! We then ripped open the tea bags, emptied the contents and tried to strain the water through the bag, but there was so much dirt it kept clogging it up! Too funny!





The rain ceased and we went for a walk to Shira Hut which was another 150m higher to better acclimatise. Climb high, sleep low is the motto they taught us!





Along the way we found park rangers equipped with rifles... Still not sure what they need them for! And the guy with the sign in book was randomly there as well as we signed in along our way! We arrived, took some group shots, saw the White necked blackbirds that seem to be everywhere at camp and also the old cave the porters used to have to sleep on.







Apparantly the altitude makes you lose your appetite. Apparantly! Unfortunately it was not the case for any if us as we ate ravenously each meal as the guides kept telling us &apos;eat like champions&apos; if we wanted to make the mountain!





The rain started again as we dined on carrot soup.... With pancakes! Random! And then rice and a beef sauce, salad and followed by fried bananas.





Sugar also seemed to be the staple diet of the mountain! In everything! On popcorn, in pancakes, in porridge and who knew what else as we watched the guides fill about 1/4 cup in their drinks! It definitely made us laugh!









It was getting harder and harder for us to clean up the mountain with each passing day with the altitude, rain, and having to bend down constantly to pick up the yinyblolly wrappers that were everywhere! We wonder what all the other groups on the mountain thought of us though- one green latex glove on our right hand as we walked!







Filling our water bottles with hot water to put in our sleeping bags and keep uscwarm was our saviour as it was starting to get colder and colder!





We were also getting out of breath on short distances... Like from the toilet to the tent!





And it was 7pm! The dark had set in and it was tome for bed asy tent mate Kate and I snuggled down waiting for the inevitable toilet breaks!
 
03 nov - day 3 kili. Shira Camp 3800AMSL - Lava Tower 4600AMSL - Barranco Camp 3900AMSL

2010-11-03

03 nov - day 3 kili. Shira Camp 3800AMSL - Lava Tower 4600AMSL - Barranco Camp 3900AMSL



0940h-1705h = 8.25h



Another cold, sleepless night, everyone raking it in turns to go to the toilet as we constantly heard all the zips of tents around and the toilet!





It was so cold! And we didn&apos;t want to get up, but the washing water arrived and we were greeted by a clear-ish day and views out towards Kili and the gorgeous valley beneath us.





Another feast of porridge, toast, eggs, sausages and oranges for breakfast, packed up, sunscreened up and we were on our way! The day started out quite nice, although it must have been 0&apos;C overnight, we were still hiking on long pants and just thermal tops. The scenery changed again to more of a moonscape and lots of nothing except giant boulders everywhere as we started &apos;pole pole&apos;, but grew tired of it and set our own pace! The altitude headaches started to set in, but thankfully not too bad with the Diamox altitude sickness tablets and aspirin!





We had fun walking again today, although we pretty much all had the poles out now to assist us with the constant uphill! And it was getting windier and colder as we ascended until... Hail! It continued until turning to snow just before our lunch break, which we could see from ages out as they had set up our dining tent for us! So awesome to escape the weather!





We sat down excited at our place settings as we had oranges, boiled eggs.... As we excited grabbed them and found them to be cold! Gutted! And then a cucumber soup with...... Deep fried bread, covered in batter and deep fried chicken! We kind of looked around as it was placed down in front of us and did our best to eat it.... But ugh! I could only manage one bite of the bread! Ewww! We convinced ourselves it was specifically designed to get us to the summit.... And that that the bread was getting too old and squished to eat straight!





The rain had started, but thankfully only a drizzle as we worked our way into our waterproof pants and out into the elements. Lunch was at 4200AMSL and so were heading another 400m up to Lava Tower, formed by an ancient volcano, in order to acclimatise. The clouds and mist were rolling in, but the walk up was quite easy! We were all pleasantly surprised! We paused as the rain started in force and we began our descent back down to camp. Or &apos;down up to camp&apos; as our guides say!





It was our first downhill and it was tough on the kneed and super slippery with the mud, rain, wet rocks and loose gravel. And we were actually going at speed too! After a few toilet stops due to the trillion litres of water we were being told to drink each day, the mist finally cleared and we could see the beautiful valley we were coming down with gorgeous but unusual green trees, waterfalls and really varying views. It was so cool!!!!





Very soon the campsite came into view - Barranco camp at 3900 AMSL. We arrived just after 5pm, meaning almost 8 1/2 hours walking. We felt pretty good though, as we sat down to hot drinks, popcorn and peanuts before the clouds cleared and we got our first proper view of the beautiful, but super steep and kind of scary looking snow covered Kilimanjaro summit! It actually scared us a little!





We then went for a walk around the campsite area and got really nice views down the valley before it started to get dark and even more freezing cold and we layered up all the clothes we owned!





Dinner, we again had the odd combination of pancakes with a tasty leek soup, then mountains of pasta with veg sauce served onto our plates; -&apos; eat, eat, eat we were told!!&apos; we tried our best but the sheer volume of food, followed by pineapple for dessert was too much!





We could see the lights of Moshi town not too far below us, even though it had taken us 3 days to walk here!





Filling our water bottles up with hot water, queueing gor the toilet and it was time to retire to our tents, - half past 8! - late night!!! :)
 
04 nov, day 4 kili. Barranco Camp 3900AMSL - Barranco Wall 4500 AMSL - Karanga Valley 3500AMSL

2010-11-04

04 nov, day 4 kili. Barranco Camp 3900AMSL - Barranco Wall 4500 AMSL - Karanga Valley 3500AMSL



0905h - 1315h = 4h 10mins



The rain started again during the night  as I woke up and lay for about an hour waiting for it to stop before I gave in and got up to pee anyway. There was someone leaving the toilet as I got up and when I came out, someone waiting to go in! Only on Kili could there be a queue for the toilet at 4 or 5 am!





Thankfully the rain had eased by the time we got up, had another great brekky, force fed ourselves more water and we set off! We were super excited as we were about to climb the Barranco Wall - a massive impenetratable looking rock face up to 4500m, which was actually rock climbing!!! It was SO much fun!! Sure, a little precarious in points, but amazing! And even more amazing that the porters did it with loads on their heads!





It took over an hour and a half to climb up, and then we had a great time on top taking photos before it was time to move on.





We climbed down a similiar rocky surface, but less steep and less vertical as I had my poles back and kept slipping everywhere. Once I gave them up it was awesome climbing! So much fun!!!!





We saw our camp in the distance..... Then rounded a corner and saw a massive, massive valley between us and it we had to go down and then up before we could arrive!!





Of course it then started raining again!! In all our thermals and raingear it was lovely and sweaty as we negotiated our way to camp. At the bottom of the valley is a waterfall and that is the last water source for the remainder of the climb. That means the porters have to make several trips to stock up and then carry it through to the end! How nasty is that!!





The terrain of the camp is semi Alpine desert and our guide Haji told us it would get to -4&apos;C tonight! Tomorrow day is going to be -5 to -8&apos;C and total Alpine desert! Already the terrain has changed so many times with the semi Alpine desert the first actual dust, kind of grey and moon like, that we had seen so far this trip.





Arriving at camp about 1315h, we were all quite glad we had chosen to do the 7 day climb and have an extra day for acclimitisation as if not, this would have just been a lunch stop! We had a feast of chicken and chips, coleslaw, White watermelon and oranges for lunch, then a Swahili lesson from our guide Haji, where we learnt lots of handy and lots of not so handy phrases! The most practical being:

Jumbo - hi

Mambo - what&apos;s up?

Poa - the response, okay.... Or as  we preferred -

Poa kacheezi kaman deezi - crazy cool like a banana!

Asante sans - thank you

Karibou Sana - your welcome

Hakuna Matata - no worries. It&apos;s real! :)





All of us were slowly getting some form of altitude effects - difficulty breathing, loss of energy, loss of co-ordination to name a few; and every other effect we had, such as tingling fingers, toes, faces, lips, anything at all, we all still bled on our altitude sickness medication, Diamox - whether or not it can do it we have no idea!!





And then we were off for a walk again! Up the hill in front of us for 50mins and back down, not so fun sliding on loose gravel, but time for dinner! :) Soup... Delicious, but unidentified.... Potato? Leek?? And pancakes again!! Then rice with axveg sauce, oranges and banana. All served by our waiter whose name he told us was Roger Moore!





It was John&apos;s birthday, Keith had told us, he had been keeping it a secret and so Keith had saved his cupcake from his packed snack 2 days earlier for this occasion! He and the crew came in with candles and we all sang happy birthday. They proceeded to cut the mini cupcake up, into about 12 pieces and we had to laugh - over time it had not changed at all - still as rock hard and hard to swallow as ever!





We had some delicious Ginger tea and time for bed at half past 7! :) but we could now see the lights of both Moshi AND Arusha below us! And SO cold in our tents our breath was freezing!!
 
Day 5 Kili, Karanga Camp 3940AMSL - Barafu camp 4600AMSL and summit prep!!!

2010-11-05

05 nov, day 5 Kili

Karanga Camp 3940AMSL - Barafu camp 4600AMSL

0840h - 1230h =4h + midnight begin summit bid!!!



A whole nights sleep! I guess I have somehow???! Finally figured out how to stay warm, and no getting up to pee equals a good night!! Hmm... Also means dehydration though... Not so good!





It was a beautiful clear morning with a perfect view of the summit!! So nice!! And literally right there in front of us after having been totally hidden all yesterday. And the other way looking down into a valley, the peak of Mt Meru, and a sea of clouds bathed pink in the sunrise! Ahhh!



The stomach bugs were starting to come out in full force. Both the Helens had been struck down by a mild case, and unfortunately Keith was down this morning. Melanie (or Melon as our guide Haji called her) was also still sick and was walking with one of the guides way behind.





We had our usual breakfast feast and were off! Single file like a prison chain gang going pole pole up the mountain!





We headed to the top of the peak near us, attempted to find good toilet locations, headed down the other side, up again and into camp! The terrain was dirt and desert like, and then we were walking over constant piles and piles and piles of rocks all the way into camp.





We were still required to sign in at every camp and if the book wasn&apos;t at the front, it was brought around to us. They asked some random questions and our answers got even more random the higher we got - occupations that started as normal became cyclists, mountaineers, rubbish collectors, musicians, masseusse, and dolphin trainers!





Robbies nose bled the last 20 mins in as we followed the trail of blood in! Our camp, Barafu, means in Swahili ice/snow so we hoped it wasn&apos;t a sign to come as it was all misted over as we arrived, but as the wind blew it away we had glimpses of the desert valley beneath us and the steep rocky trail to our front. Kates and my tent was also pitched on what looked like right on the edge! Hilarious! It would be crazy to be there in peak season, it was jam packed as it was!







We saw the Germans who we had started the trek with us who were climbing in 6 days and were on their way down. 2 had made it, 2 hadn&apos;t.





We had chicken and chips... Again! :) for lunch... After this trip I never want to see fried food again as long as I live, but we figure it must be a diet constructed to get us to the top!





Keith was sleeping and Melanie was being told she was not able to attempt the summit due to her sickness. So, it was lunch for 8, which the 6 of us devoured in no time. Appetite loss??! What&apos;s that?!! Apparantly it happens to everyone... Except us!! :)







After lunch we settled in fir a nap before we would be woken at 5pm for dinner and then the summit tonight !!!! :)







Up again at 5 for a delicious, but unidentified soup, pancakes and the worlds biggest spaghetti platter with veg sauce and pineapple to follow. Nonetheless we did our best and between second and third serves got rid of a sizeable chunk!





We had a very brief brief on the evenings summit bid, were told to eat lots, then eat more, and if we threw up, just let them know and we could get more food!!







We watched the most amazing sunset over the clouds, then we got dressed into our layers and got into bed to try and sleep. It was about 6:30pm and we were due to be woken up at 10:30pm.







Our tent was right next to the porters of several companies and so not much opportunity to sleep!







Our waiter, Roger Moore was due to wake us at 10:40pm, but about 10:45 I heard the guides say hello to Robbie and checked my watch. Argh! Then the guides too realised and started yelling at poor Riger Moore!!





We got into our final layers -



2 x socks

Gaiters

2 x long johns

Trackpants

Windproof/waterproof pants



Thermal singleton

Thermal long sleeve

Hiking shirt

Long sleeve shirt

Jumper

Fleece

Down jacket

And waterproof jacket in bag!



Beanie

Neckwarmer x 2



Liner gloves

Snow gloves

Hand warmers!!!



.... And then attempted to walk :). We had hot Ginger tea and biscuits, filled our drink bottles, stuffed ourselves on immodium, diamox, asprin, multivitamins, electrolyte drinks, had final toilet stops, final layers intact and into our prison chain gang line to start hiking about midnight!!
 
Day 6 Kili - NOT FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2010-11-06

Barafu Camp 5600AMSL - Stella Point 5745AMSL - Uhuru Peak 5895AMSL - Barafu Camp 4600AMSL - Mweka Hut 3100AMSL



0000h - 1050h



14-15h - 1720h





Melanie was feeling better and hiking with us, so all eight of us left as michellin men with our four guides, Haji, Innocent, Killien, Gilbert, and a summit porter to assist us also.



We started a steep uphill and were soon climbing over rocks, through dirt, on cutbacks and loose rocks...and still FREEZING!!! Through all those layers!! We started to warm up slowly though, but found it a nightmare to get our drink bottles from inside our backpacks (where they were all wrapped up as we were trying to protect them from freezing!) with our snow gloves on and layers with handwarmers inside!



So in our headlamps, pitch black and climbing up rock slabs, over big outcrops and hoping not to have a massive drop on the other side! Oh well, at least we couldn&apos;t see it if it did happen! :-)



When we dared look up from the shoes for the person in front we were following and not topple over from the weird feelings we had, the stars were so close and so clear it was amazing. We could see both Moshi and Arusha village lights so bright!



And so it continued through the long dark hours of the night, the air getting thinner and thinner with each step as people began to slow down or stop off the back of our line. We then split into two groups and it started to hit all of us as even the first group I was in started to struggle, the guides took their backpacks and if we stopped for any more than a few minutes our toes and fingers would get so cold and so stiff and so painful we couldn&apos;t move them! It was awful!!!!



Soon all our clothes, exposed flesh and backpacks began to be covered in thick ice, a nasty wind picked up and it was SO cold. -15 to -20&apos;C the guides estimated. I cannot even begin to describe how cold and awful we felt!!!! It was Nasty! And the most bizarre feeling ever to be in that extreme kind of climate, like some sort of crazy 1900&apos;s expeditioner covered in ice!



And so it continued some more in our never ending night. Literally a never ending cycle of plodding one foot in front of the other, int he pitch darkness, our headlights illuminating the shoes of the person in front of us to follow. We thought we would be walking forever.



It is funny to look back on it, but not so much at the time - we were so layered up, so cold and so immobile that it was impossible for us to do anything at all for ourselves. Not able to drink, hands stuck in positions around poles, our lovely guides individually helped us all to get our bottles, placed them in our claw like hands and then took them back and placed them away! Even things like undoing zips on our jackets to get a snack or lolly or tissue was beyond us!! Ridiculous!!!



Various people were getting various symptoms of altitude sickness and then all of the sudden I went from joking around with the others to not being able to physically move. I tried so hard, but it was actually impossible. I was so scared. I tried to say something was wrong, but all of the sudden everything was too hard, impossible. I&apos;m not sure if a break was called, but somehow I was sitting on a massive rock trying to say I felt like I was going to faint when apparently (so the others told me!) I just flopped backwards like a rag doll and slid down the rock ( slicing a hole in my good Kathmandu down jacket in the process i found out later too!!! doh!! That would account for all the feathers everywhere I went though...! :-) ) and woke up at kind of an odd angle semi on the rock, semi on the floor and being held in place by Keith. Whoa! I still felt woozy and nauseous and so the guide took me over to the side...not that I could tell any difference from where I was in the pitch black!! I threw up and suddenly felt heaps better, so rejoined the crew who were nice enough to wait for me. No problems! Well...for a few steps anyway!! It was getting tougher and tougher to move and by the next break I was about to keel over and just collapsed on the ground. I don&apos;t really remember much from here on in, except it was 5am and sunrise wasn&apos;t until 0630 and I knew we would be at Stella point at sunrise which was the massive milestone to get to before the summit.



One and a half hours I just kept repeating. One and a half hours. One and a half hours. I can do it! I can do it. I vaguely remember trying to walk and physically not being able to breathe or move or do anything as i just leant forward on my poles and tried not to fall over. It is really difficult to describe, but I have heard it called an invisible wall before and I now know exactly why it is called that! It is literally there stopping you from doing anything!!





I tried so hard to walk, to move, to breathe, to do anything, and around me there were others also leaning on their sticks, sitting on the ground. I remember looking up at one point and realising that is was somehow suddenly totally light, sunrise had passed and I had totally missed it! I don&apos;t remember feeling anything at the time, but just wondering where that that last hour and a half vanished into about 10 steps of pure agony and how on earth the light had come without me noticing it, but later I was gutted that I missed the most beautiful sunrise closer to the sky than I would ever be again!!!



...but more importantly, I was definitely NOT at Stella Point! I was most definitely not anywhere!



Still remembering is all a blur, but imprinted in my mind is trying so hard to walk, but it was impossible. Melanie told me later I apparently turned around at one point, leaning on my poles as she tried to talk to me I just stared totally through her with totally vacant eyes. I think I may have said I felt faint, I remember really trying to say it, but I couldn&apos;t even form the words, so I am not sure. The next thing I remember is opening my eyes as someone took my pulse and someone else was trying to rip my top layers of clothes off. Quite a feat considering the number of layers I had on!!



I just remember thinking &apos;Ah, I must have had a nap!&apos;...weird I know now! And then just said, &apos;Hi, I&apos;m fine&apos; I&apos;m just having a nap&apos; or something like that a few times before the flurry died down and I was on my feet again being dragged by our guide Haji and the summit porter to the top of the hill. It was weird, everytime I fainted and woke up, it was like my body was reset to the current altitude and I was fine...and then i tried to move and it was back hitting harder than ever!



I vaguely remember telling him to leave me there where I was as moving was just making it all worse, which he wouldn&apos;t and so I told him just to take me to the top of the hill and leave me there to die instead! I felt like absolute crap!!!!



My tentmate Kate later told me they were nearing the top of the hill in their (slower and much diminished!!) chain gang when they looked back to see me convulsing on the ground and all the guides from surrounding groups literally dropping their people to run and give aid. She said it was really scary! Lucky I don&apos;t remember it!!! :-)



Apparently I then stood up rather shakily, smiled and attempted to keep walking! And failed :-). So one guide assisting me didn&apos;t work as I made him stop about every two steps as he was going too fast and my body felt like it was going to explode or something! Another guide came along and they literally dragged me the last 50m up to the top of the hill and sat me on the ground.



It turned out this hill that I had been dragged to was Stella Point! I had made it there!



Apparently people from the group came to talk to me, but I don&apos;t remember! Helen said my eyes were rolling back in my head so she just kept feeding me dirilyte - the electrolyte re-hydration drink until I looked more normal! I was so useless I couldnt even more or do anything as I was literally hand fed snacks by the guides like I was a baby, glucose energy tablets from Robbie and then delicious hot water from John and Keith as they also gave me new heat packs for my hands that were frozen into pole shaped claws and hurt like hell!!!!!



Somehow I managed to become acclimatised and coherent and understood when Uhuru Peak, the very top of the summit was pointed out. And it wasn&apos;t even that much higher. But &apos;No way&apos; I said, feeling lucky to be alive, with nothing left and like I had done everything that I possibly could. And i was happy about that.



But somehow I was on my feet, walking really really really slow for five minutes with the boys to see if I could do it. It was only 150m higher altitude, but a very slow, gradual rise - almost like walking flat..ish :-). And somehow I was doing it! Falling over and useless, but doing it! Surrounded by amazing members of our group, I think it may have been over an hour as we walked above the clouds, staring at the massive gorgeous blue glaciers right next to us as we approached the peak. We all pretty much burst into tears and started hugging each other as we saw the sign for &apos;Uhuru Peak&apos; proudly proclaiming &apos;Congratulations, you are now at Uhuru Peak, Tanzania, 5895AMSL. Africa&apos;s highest point and the world&apos;s highest freestanding mountain.&apos; It was probably the hardest thing we have ever done and will ever do in our lives, pushing us mentally and physically and although we never started with any doubt in our minds, at some point all of us didn&apos;t really think we would make it. And, we had ALL made it. And apparently it is quite unusual for that to happen. It was some kind of record Haji told us later, but I&apos;m not sure for Zara, for him personally or for what - we were all too tired to figure it out!!!





We had arrived at Uhuru Peak, (which I later found out means independent peak in Swahiki) 5895AMSL at 0725h.



A few photos later, we began our descent, down the steep, steep, rocky, sandy, loose path back to our campsite. And to say it was steep was an understatement! You could have had a black ski run down there!! I was walking with John, Keith and one Helen, and one of our guides, Gilbert ran to follow us and keep us on track! We slipped and slid down the dirt path in our exhausted states, often all of us slipping on various loose rocks and then just lying there in the dirt, not wanting to get up!





It was starting to become very hot in all our zillion layers as well with the sun beating down on us incessantly from what felt like very close range. Haji still had my bag and was somewhere else... so no water, no hat, no sunscreen, and nowhere to put the thousands of excess clothes I had! No wonder we were so dehydrated we didn&apos;t pee the entire time!!



It was a long long long journey back to camp, extreme steepness, sliding down on never ending switchbacks, attempting not to fall, attempting not to dehydrate, attempting not to breathe in too much dust, attempting not to roast to death as it just became too much to hold everything we had and we just piled our poor guide Gilbert up with hundreds of layers of down jackets, fleeces, waterproofs, as he waddled down behind us!



Even then we still had several layers of thermals on, and all the thousand layers on the bottom we had started with, sweating up a storm inside out waterproof pants! Soooooo hot!



And then we could see it in the distance!! We felt like cheering! Our little campsite resting on the rocks ahead...but still a fair way. 45 mins Gilbert said... so anywhere between 15 mins and 2 hours - that was how good we had found his time judgement to be!!!



Eleven hours climbing to and back from the summit. Crazy!



We were greeted with a sweet cordial and congratulations from Roger Moore, our waiter before we collapsed on the nearest rocks and then dragged ourselves to say goodbye to Robbie who had chosen a six day hike (as opposed to our seven) and had to leave the mountain today.



When I recounted my tales, people made jokes about there being no pubs up there, but technically it wasn&apos;t true - the people where we had to sign in were quite enterprising and had a stash of beer cans, cans of coke and chocolate bars in case you wanted to pay a small fortune for the luxury!



I am surprised they dragged me up and let me continue, knowing now how dangerous altitude sickness can be... but I guess they have more experience in it than me.. Still...!!!! And I was so glad I was as it was the most amazing feeling and knowing later that i had made it.



We then collapsed into our beds, to scull water in an attempt to rehydrate and attempt to sleep.



We were shattered, but still full of adrenalin I guess as we had a restless &apos;rest&apos; as we were woken around 1315h for lunch as we unhappily attempted to drag ourselves out of bed for the potato and noodle soup lunch and fresh fruit that was waiting.



As we got our briefing it began to rain, and then hail and continued as we packed our bags and continued our descent. Ahh rain! We couldn&apos;t have one day without it!! Unfortunately it made the path really slippery ..........



We began to walk down the trail, as Kate walked off ahead. She later told us she had come across our other waiter who had slipped and was lying injured on the path with this load around him. He was unable to move and as the last person through there was no one behind him to help. Kate quickly headed on down to camp to get some other porters to return and assist. Unfortunately it turned out his knee was badly injured and he would be out for a few months. Double unfortunately he still had a whole day of walking ahead of him
 
Day 7 Kili - Mweka hut 3100 amsl - Mweka gate - Moshi 950amsl

2010-11-07 to 2011-11-07

07 nov, Day 7 kili



Mweka hut 3100 amsl - Mweka gate  - Moshi 950amsl



Our final day on the mountain. We were a little sad to be finishing up, but still glad we had had the opportunity to climb and have such an awesome group of people. A totally random group of individuals thrown together, and I could not have picked a better group if I had tried! I loved being a part of the team and it would not have been the same without them all!



It was the toughest, but also one of the most amazing things I have and will ever do in my life, but I cannot believe how fast the trip went. 7 days in a flash! But it also meant 7 days without a shower and 7 days in the same clothes.... Delightful! In fact once it started to get cold, we woke up, walked and then went to bed in them! It was a running joke to ask what someone was wearing that day and the response- the same thing I wore havnt taken off for the last 3 days in fact!







We breakfasted and were told the team would like to preform for us. The porters, guides and everyone gathered in together and started singing and dancing for us. There was a local traditional welcome song of Tanzania they preformed, starting with &apos;Jumbo&apos;, Or hi in Swahili and changing the words to suit us climbing the mountain, substituting all the campsite names we had stayed at and ending with &apos;Kilimanjaro, Hakuna Matata&apos;. Kilimanjaro, no worries! It was awesome and we were all in a great mood as we started off down the mountain, our guides teaching us the first verse to sing along to.







We watched the porters overtake us, some even sliding also on the slippery muddy ground, and we just hoped they could get up again!





The mweka route down involved a lot of slippery stairs and a few pretty views, like looking out at the Royal National Park or Blue Mountains at home, with lots of greenery, but overall it was quite plain and definitely nowhere near as pretty or interesting as the machame route that we had climbed up.





At one point, looking back behind us, we had an amazing clear view backwards of the mountain and peak and we could hardly believe we were there on top a day before. It looked so high and so ridiculously far!







The route opened out to fairly wide downwards sloping loose gravel paths and we came across the scary looking contraptions they use as stretchers on the mountain- just lots of metal to make a bed, wheels at the back and the poles continuining out at either end to be used as handles. We put Jon on, Keith grabbed the back, I the front and we attempted to wheel him down the mountain. Wow! Nasty!  My feet began to slip over the loose gravel and I had to yell out for the guides to quickly grab it before we all slid to our deaths! They took over and were flying down the hill, over the bumps at a rate of knots. I would most definitely hate to have to be stretchered out!!!





I read in the local newspaper several weeks later that tennis superstar Martina Navratilova had been stretchered out with altitude sickness and that a climber had died of it on the mountain also. I guess it just shows how real it can be.





As we continued our descent I suddenly slipped on some of the loose rocks...slam! Down into the road! Ow! I was disappointed to find I had ripped a hole in my hiking pants! Doh! How annoying! It was only later as we sat down for a drink break that I unzipped my pants to inspect the damage and found the area starting to bruise or swell up and a small chunk missing from my knee, pebbles and blood. Doh again!







We waited just 10 minutes from the end for everyone as we walked the final section to the end all together.





The finishing gate was a little disapointing! No massive structure like Machame where we had started, just a kind of gate that is swung open and closed, used to stop cars entering. Nevertheless we crossed happily, pleased to have completed the climb successfully, but still a little disappointed it was all over!







Posing for photos, it didn&apos;t take long for the hawkers to be all over us, trying to sell us everything from t-shirts to statues, stickers, knives, carvings... You name it! They even wanted our boots!





We made our way to the office for the final signing out, our occupations getting more and more inventive. John was a ninja, Keith a soup taster or soap tester, I was too tired to figure out which! And I moonlighted as a dolphin trainer!







A representative from zara came to meet and congratulate us which was nice, and we piled back into the minibus and drove from mweka gate back down to the Springlands hotel in Moshi. Our porters had already gone ahead, so little different to our first trip out a week ago.





Arriving back at the hotel we were welcomed in and had a reunion with Robbie and our guide Innocent who had descended in one day instead of two luke we had chosen to do. Dumping our stuff in our allocated rooms we headed out across the road to plant some trees. This was another part of the &apos;clean up the mountain&apos; initiative to give something back to the community by planting trees across the sandy barren land.







We walked to where there were little seedlings sitting and we each picked one out and walked across to where holes had been dug for us. We added more dirt to our already filthy selves as we got down, planted our little trees and filled in the holes with the rocky dirt as water was brought up from the nearby stream to feed them. As much as I would like to hope both mine, and all our little trees survive, it is a harsh climate out there, and looking around I just hoped for the best! What did impress me though was seeing Yassins tree that is now taller than him that had been planted 5 years ago after his first climb. Fingers crossed!





As part of our climb we were required to tip the staff that took us. We were aware of this and had worked out on the mountain, but then had managed to misplace the paper, so whilst the guides waited, we attempted to get our tired brains into gear and figure out all the numbers! This took a surprisingly long, confusing time, but we managed to get there in the end and met the crew to explain and say thanks.





We also then one by one, received our certificates. One from zara tours, and one from the National Parks. A gold border signifying that we had reached the summit, which we had all... Somewhat miraculously achieved! Those that made it to Steela Point instead would receive a yellow certificate. I have to say I was quite proud of that. Maybe even more so than getting my university degree it was that tough. Definitely one if the hardest things I have ever done, and probably will achieve in my life!





It was getting late and so quickly we all headed in before lunch finished. Waiting to be seated, I looked up and found someone waving at me. I was like &apos; how on earth can I know anybody here ?!&apos; I walked over and found my friend Matt who I was to stay with sitting there! He had got my message about the climb changing and sent me one back (which I had not yet received!) saying no problem, he would come out anyway and hang around as he hadn&apos;t seen Moshi! So nice! We had another delicious lunch and as Matt retired to chill out by the pool, we all retired to attempt to wash off a weeks grime! Running out the hot water, but emerging clean and refreshed from the shower I began the task of cleaning the gear and returning the items I had hired to the store.







By this time it was getting on in the day, and although Matt had to work the next day, he kindly offered to stay the night in the spare bed in my room and we would head off first thing in the morning so we could have dinner with the whole crew and chill out before we left.





We hung chatting in the bar before heading in to the massive table that had been set for all of us climbers, guides and a seat for Matt in the dining room. We enjoyed our delicious buffet dinner before raising our glasses in a celebratory &apos;cheers&apos; to the group and recounting stories of our days on the mountain. One by one the guides got up to give a little speech, these starting out relatively normal and lovely, talking about the climb, thanking us, saying how well we did, telling us to get our parents and friends out here to climb (.....okay, not that any of us could imagine convincing our parents to climb!) and getting progressively worse the drunker they got... The highlight (?!) being Killens speech super long constantly going around in circles culminating in the point of there is &apos;one god!&apos; and attempting ro spell this out for our benefit.... &apos;Zero, n, e!&apos; at which point we were all trying not to laugh!







We sadly said our goodbyes to our crew and Robbie who were staying elsewhere as we headed off to our beer garden for a final drink, not wanting the night to end just yet. But alas, all good things come to an end as we hugged and parted our seperate directions for the night.... And probably a little surprised that we had last beyond 9pm... The latest I think we went to bed the entire time on the mountain!





Climbing Kili was definitely one of the hardest, but most amazing things I have done and I am so glad I had the opportunity to do so with such an amazing group of people.







I found out later I had raised $537 for the Hamlin Fistula Hospital and want to say a massive massive thank you to everyone out there that offered their support. The charity were so appreciative, It was fantastic, so thank you so much!
 
An African Adventure

2010-11-08 to 2011-01-20

Yes, I know I am getting a little ahead of myself seeing as I have yet to type up my adventures from Russia and Scandinavia, but I was just booking flights and getting excited so thought I would write this quick one first!



I originally went through a travel agency as other workmates had said they got some really good deals, but luckily I also did my own research and found a cheaper price for every single flight they gave me. Yes, it took over a day of sitting searching, planning and booking but I saved over 368 pounds over four flights so I was pretty happy with that!



So I will be heading to Ethiopia on 20 Oct to visit the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital and outpost clinics before I head to Tanzania to climb Mt Kilimanjaro to raise money for this amazing place. I will have all the details next week so will write more on it then!!



I then head to rural Tanzania to visit an ex passenger of mine, Matt, who is working in a school there before I am hoping to backpack through Rwanda and down to Nairobi, Kenya to meet some of my best friends, Mick and Monty before starting a 56 day African Safari - http://www.topdeck.travel/africa/safari-tours - there is not much info there, just a map I will put here anyway.



So, my birthday (4th Dec) will be heading from Lake Naivasha to Nairobi, Kenya...

Christmas will be in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, and....

New Years Eve in the Okavango Delta, Botswana with New Years Day on the road to Maun, Botswana. Pretty Exciting!!!



And then 3 months later, on 20 Jan I head back to London to grab my winter gear and head to Canada for my next adventure!!!!
 
Moshi to Sinoni, Tanzania

2010-11-08

I definitely felt a little rough around the edges today! My knee was quite swollen and sore, I had the alternating between stuffed and super runny nose, my nose was peeling from over blowing, chapped lips and super tired! My head was also super foggy and I was Very glad to no longer be taking Diamox though!





Matt and I woke up early, met Kate for breakfast, But as much as I had enjoyed the delicious brown porridge on the trail (which inlater found out is millet) and various other breakfast items I could face them no longer! Fresh fruit! Yay!





I checked out and again they had been amazing, yassin had taken off all the meals I had eaten, and although Matt had eaten also, I was only charged for the few drinks that we had had. Sooooooo nice! They had looked after me so well. www.zaratours.com - definitely recommended!





I sadly said goodbye as we took a taxi to downtown Moshi bus station and jumped on the bus for Arusha, randomly seeing Robbie from the window ! Just a few US Dollars and about a hundred people jammed in, 3 to a seat and also standing, babies being passed through the front window so mothers could jam in the back, goods transported between different stops and  about 2 hours later we arrived in Arusha. As usual everyone crowded around us and one grabbed my sarong and tried to hide it beneath his jacket and wouldn&apos;t listen to my demands for it back. Luckily Matt speaks Swahili and it was back on no time. It was only later that I realised they also had my good Kathmandu water bottle! Damn!





We got onto the little mini bus that was to take us about 15 mins to Matt&apos;s village, backpacks and all jammed in with about 20 other people, several hanging out the side! It was a few minutes walk to his house and everyone was genuinely friendly, saying hello, waving, practicing a few words of English and expecting nothing back. SO nice!





Matt lives with a lovely Irish teacher named Mary in a really cool house provided by the school. I even had my own room! We quickly dropped our bags and walked about 20 mins through the dirt roads,  past farms, through banana plantations, over creeks and past dirt soccer fields to his school, Edmund Rice Sinon Secondary School www.edmundricesinon.com





The school is much bigger, and better equiped than i had expected, with 1500 students of which a percentage are borders. There was a big library, computer lab, home ec rooms,  science labs, and everything! There were also &apos;mamas&apos;- the respectful term for women older than yourself with massive pots and fires cooking up traditional Tanzanian food in the yard for the kids to buy for lunch.





The other interesting thing was the toilets! The waste went down into a massive poo pond at the back of the school where it was then harassed and used as power for the school canteen! Brilliant! We had ugali for lunch in the staff room.... The main local food, looking kind of like mashed potatoes with a similiar, but stickier consistency it tasted about as good as play dough! We had it with a bean dish which was nice, but I am not sure how much more I could eat of it!





I was getting really tired and decided to head home. I was fairly sure I could remember the route, but the dirt tracks and banana plantations all looked the same! I knew I was on the wrong road, but didn&apos;t know which one I decided to box around the house until I got there! It worked quite well, but taking probably an hour longer than it should have! It was a nice walk though, I found the house and definitely nice to stretch the legs! Along the way I encountered so many people who all wanted to practice their English and say hi, but not hassle me for anything... a totally different vibe to Ethiopia!!





I started to do some washing from the trek, succeeding in turning the water black, before giving up and passing out for a few hours on the couch! So tired!





Matt and Mary arrived home, we dropped by the little local store across the road to buy a few things which was lots of fun whilst we waited for their friends Jocam and David who we were heading out to dinner with to arrive. It was an awesome evening to walk, but had to stand on the upwind side of the road to avoid the majority of the dust generated from the dulla dullas, the little mini buses zooming past.





The place they wanted to take us for pork was out and so we caught a dulla dulla into the next little village for another place. We found the butcher, who pointed us in the right direction gor the people that cooked the meat! It was quite dark by this stage and as someone guided us through the maze of backstreets we decided that we would be safer not there and quickly headed back to the main road! We ended up at the local pub, the Engosheraton, which had a massive outdoor area complete with grass and trees. So nice!





We shared a traditional Tanzanian meal of roasted meat chunks, chicken and chips before heading home stumbling over the unlit, uneven tracks to make a banana cake! The gas wasn&apos;t attaching to the oven and so we took ten minute shifts each holding the gas connection down so we could have gas to power the oven and cook. The result- delicious warm banana cake! Mmm mmm!





And I also got the stomach bug Keith had had on the mountain that had floored him for a day. Not quite sure how he managed to back up and make the summit afterwards as it is not fun at all!





It was do amazing having the opportunity to see the awesome little village in which Matt lived and worked, to see the friendly local community, be able to relax in such a comfortable place and so nice of him to have me, but I was definitely missing my kilimanjaro family I had spent an amazing and challenging 24/7 with for the past week! So lucky I was able to be hanging out with such lovely people as Matt and Mary or it would have been a hard transition!
 
MADE IT!

2010-11-09

Made it to the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro! Will write more soon! It was so so so tough, but amazing!
 
Living locally :) taking classes, washing at the river, and &apos;Good to see you mzungu!&apos; Sinoni, Tanza

2010-11-09 to 2010-11-10

Taking time to try and get moving as I was so so so tired! I managed to find my way into school ready for some classes! I was going to be a guest in Mary&apos;s form 1 Class, so our year 7; where the children had written questions each they were going to ask me in an interview. I arrived, told them a bit about me and then began the questions! It was very interesting and I was asked all manner of questions from which tribe I was from, about my jobs, what I liked about Tanzania, what I would change about Tanzania, the food, soccer, sport and life in australia, everything! We then played a game of Guess Who or celebrity heads as I know it, and the kids had picked me to be myself which was quite cool.







The next period I then headed next door to my next class! Here it was very different. I gave a long speech about myself and what I had done, and as this weeks topic was &apos;Fantasy and &apos;Adventure&apos;, I told some stories of things that had happened to me whilst I had been travelling. The kids then just asked questions on what I had spoken about and they were so Interested, I was asked a thousand questions on climbing mt kilimanjaro, from whether it was sustainable to have Trekkers there, what I had learnt from completing it, the climate, weather, terrain, animals, ages of climbers, you name it! I was also asked about different places I had been in detail, about my training and time in the Army, why Australia was called the land down under- random! And why the black people were in the centre of Australia- even more ramdom as I did not even bring that up! And it was so interesting to see passing comments I had made piqué their interest and then be asked questions on it.







I was also asked if I was writing a book on my adventures as they said it sounded so interesting they would love to read about which was really sweet.







We then had Wali (rice) and beans for lunch in the staff room and tried to organise a bus to Rwanda.... Unfortunately the Internet has not really caught on and I could only find timetables from 2005 and companies that apparently no longer existed!







Matt and I walked home and gathered together our laundry. We met our neighbour Jocam and headed down to the river. It is beautiful and green and a bamboo fountain channels the water coming down from the mountains so we could fill our buckets. It was so nice and relaxing, sitting in the pretty surroundings there in the afternoon cool and chatting. Such a nice way to do laundry... If you have a spare hour or so anyway!







It was also hilarious as whilst we were sitting there, one of the local teenagers walked past, looked at us, and then returned 10 mins later with his camera to take photos of us. We laughed so hard as it was a massive role reversal!







We finished up and headed to Jocams family&apos;s shamba - A farm I guess is a good way to describe it. At the back of their house are small fields filled with sugar cane, bananas, cassova and various other foods. It is bordered by a river and has the most amazing view of Mt Meru! Stunning! It is a really beautiful, green and tranquil place as we wandered around eating sugar cane Jocam cut down freshly with the punga (kind of light machete) they use for farming.







Next stop was the Engosheraton, our local pub where  we met up with a group of Aussies who are working for Food, Water, Shelter, a NGO operating locally. We ate another local speciality- chipsi mayai - - (chips eggs!) Which is an omelette with a bit of grated carrot, green capsicum and chips cooked right into it!







I was Shattered!! We stumbled home and I could barely stay awake, and my whole head was stuffy. I guess it takes a while to get over the mountain!







The next morning I was bravely leaving the safety of the lovely quiet little village to head into Arusha to find a bus ticket! I walked down to the mainroad and caught the dala dala into town. It was quite funny as the conductor was wearing a McDonalds shirt uniform! It was a wonderfully uneventful journey as I arrived and headed to where the map had indicated a bus company office. Unfortunately it was not there and I unexcitedly headed toward the bus station where I was hounded by touts trying to sell me their wares or get me onto buses to Dar Es Salem or other random destinations. I turned and hightailed it out of there, shaking them off my arms as I left and headed towards the nearest hotel for a recommendation! I was then on my way to Akamba Bus lines office, which was a bit out of town but was brilliant. I arrived and no one harassed me, I queued to ask my questions and it was so normal it was amazing!  The guy was so helpful, was able to answer everything and it was just 70 000 Tanzanian Shillings, or about $45 USD for my journey. So I needed to be there at 3:30pm the next day, thursday. I would cross the border to Kenya, and then arrive in Kampala, Uganda at about 11am Friday. I would then leave about 7pm and arrive in Kigali, Rwanda at about 7am on Sat! Epic 3 days of travel!







I walked back into town, gave the bus station a wide berth, but still got harassed! I went through the local markets and then down to Friends Corner to catch a dala dala back to our village. I asked for &apos;Engo&apos;, the local pub which was my destination, was told yes by the kid that was the conductor and gestured onboard.







We were packed in and it was so hot! It took a while for me to see out the window, but when I did, it did not look right! The kid confirmed Engo and very soon we came to the end of the line and everyone alighted. I gave the kid the dirtiest look and again said Engo? To which he again replied yes, I followed him across the other side of the road, again said Engo as he laughed and ran off. I was so angry! We were at a 4 way intersection of several very small dirt roads and there was no infrastructure around! I could tell I was the wrong angle to Mount Meru and was trying to figure out my best way of appproach across the fields when someone called out to me in English - &apos;where are you going mzungu?&apos; mzungu bring the Swahili word for white foreigner. He confirmed the direction for me and I embarked upon my trek through fields, past buildings of mud brick homes, across a massive dried up river ditch, over farmed land and finally got towards some civilisation of small local stores, homes and people staring and calling out &apos;hey mzungu!&apos; or &apos;Mambo mzungu?&apos; how are you foreigner? to me. One little kid was quite cute though - &apos;good to see you mzungu!&apos; it certainly made me laugh!







I finally, about 25 mins or so later came across quite a large road and determined a right hand turn onto it, soon backed up by someone saying something to me that had the word &apos;Edmundi&apos; in it, and smiling and pointing, I guess asking if I was heading to the school, so I figured i was going the right direction! After about another 10 mins I saw in the distance the Engo pub! Finally! A landmark I knew! I continued on the road until it came to a fork for a shortcut Matt had told me about and came across a sign for the school! Yay! Almost 50 mins since I had gotten off the Dala Dala I was walking into the school! So happy to be there back in the world of normality and friendly people!







I had just made it in time for the end of lunch and Matt took me to around to &apos;Mama Ray&apos; to try some local  Tanzanian food. For 1000 Tanzanian shillings (the exchange rate is about 1500 to 1 USD), so less than $1, I got a MASSIVE bowl of food with rice, chips, meat and sauce, beans and sauce and a shredded green veg thing! And all Delicious!





After classes finished we headed to the Christian brothers house for a chat and drink before picking up a new gas bottle and getting driven home by Brother Leonard to set it up.... No more rotations holding it on to cook! :)





We then walked down to the main road and chatted to some super cool local children before buying fresh veggies for dinner from the &apos;Mamas&apos; or older ladies selling their produce on little tables at the side of the road. It was fun buying the various things we needed from all the different ladies and then heading a bit further up to buy freshly made Chipatis ( the local and amazingly delicious and simple flour and water savoury pancakes) from a lady making them just up the street! So good! At home Matt made a &apos;Matt style&apos; Tanzanian vegie stew that we had with rice and chipatis.... Mmmm! A lovely neighbour over the back fence even sent over some fresh milk as a gift! How sweet is that ! Although only here for few days, i am definitely going to miss the friendly little community, the atmosphere, an awesome house and doing normal stuff hanging out with Matt and Mary!  After my experience in Ethiopia, it was so nice to be able to have the opportunity to come to a happy and friendly villiage and be able to change my rather negative and cynical view of &apos;Africa&apos; that I had developed!




 
I&apos;m starting to think I am cursed! Sinoni, Arusha, Tanzania to Kigali, Rwanda; via Nairobi, Kenya an

2010-11-11 to 2010-11-13

Surprisingly enough I was looking forward to my trillion hour, 3 day bus trip to Rwanda as I was so exhausted I honestly just wanted to sleep for 3 days!







I packed up and walked to school to say farewells. Heading to the main road to catch the dala dala it was certainly a tight squish with my bag and the thousand other people squished in, until I realised that not only were my legs bent at an increasingly painful unnatural angle, but they were sitting right on the head of the engine! Ooooow! That felt like the longest ride in history that is for sure!







After buying my ticket on the Akamba bus I stood waiting excitedly... And then just waiting and waiting some more! About an hour and a quarter after we wee supposed to leave the bus arrived, and the underneath bins couldn&apos;t? Wouldn&apos;t? Open and the tiny space at the back was not big enough to fit everyones bags, and so we carried these onto the bus to be jammed around the seat of the driver! Lovely!







I was last on and the only spare seat in the bus was right up the back, next to the other mzungu, or White foreigner girl. It was quite odd how no one wanted to sit with us! And I settled down to nap, but this was not going to be the case. The roads may in fact be the worst I have seen... Ever! Even worse than that horror ride in Albania! I was so glad there were seatbelts as that was the only thing holding us in place as we bounced ridiculously all over the place, and constantly bottomed out the bus with giant thuds. But in probably less than an hour I didn&apos;t have to worry as we were going nowhere. We had an engine failure and we were stopped at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere! We sat for another hour before the engine spluttered to life and we slowly slowly crept forward at snails pace. The road was being upgraded and we had to go cross country a few times, and other attempt to pass a truck on the same skinny road with a mountain on one side and ditch on the other. It was quite good driving as we passed with milimetres to spare. About 20 mins later we again ground to a halt at the side of the road next to a small village. Apparantly it would be safer to wait here whilst a mechanic drove from Moshi to fix the bus. We sat here for well over another 2 hours as the dark descended and quite a few passengers spent the time boozing up at the local &apos;pub&apos; and then telling apparently hilarious extremely loud stories and laughing non stop all through the night.







And finally.... Away again! We drove to the border where we all got out, passed Tanzanian immigration and then had to walk a couple of hundred metres through the dark to the Kenyan side, of course being annoyed by touts the whole way! Filling out the paperwork, the foreigners had extra to do and so took much longer to get through. When I finally emerged, touts told me the bus had left down the road. Disbelieving, and unable to see it anywhere in the dark, I attempted to return to the Tanzanian side, but the touts grabbed me and pointed down the road. One last look and not seeing it anywhere, I began to walk and hit several hundreds metres with no sign of it when I became increasingly wary  and stopped. Just then a guy I recognised from the bus came sprinting toward me! &apos;the bus&apos; he yelled!!! Aparanyly it had left and he was trying to catch it. Great! We hurried down the dark road for another few hundred metres until we saw the lights in the distance. Made it! What a crap system!







I buckled in in a vain attempt to stop me being thrown around the bus as we bounced along our journey. At 1am we pulled into Nairobi and half the passengers alighted. The remainder of us were heading to Uganda. Soon people started grabbing their things and were saying the bus was going no further.  I befriended a nice Ugandan girl in front of me and together we tried to work out what was happening. Apparantly we were to spend the night in the bus station and a new bus would come in the morning. Trying to explain that I was not safe in a bus depot fell on deaf ears and amidst dozens of angry passengers the superviser came to tell us the situation. We were taken upstairs for our included dinner and then told to sleep until 6am when the ticket office opened. Hmmm not the greatest experience of my life, But at least I can say I am still alive and was not robbed! Although someone did steal the spare padlock I had just clipped to the side of my bag, and nothing else. But my Ugandan friend did her best to protect me!







And so with no sleep at 6am we queued at the ticket office, and i tried to get them to understand that I had  now missed my connection to Rwanda and putting me on a bus to Uganda was not enough!!! Finally I got through, whilst my Ugandian friend and the others off the bus rallied around me. We then convinced them to give us a free breakfast for the hassle they had caused. They gave me my voucher first - the only foreigner- and then made everyone else wait about 15 mins. I wondered if they were going to give them any when they started making a ruckus and they all of the sudden appeared. I waved the others off on seperate buses as I waited til for my new connection. And only 2 guys tried to get my contact details, and another few passed their cards. Definitely much nicer than Ethiopia where it seemed to average 2 people a minute!!







Sitting on the hard chairs as 10am, my scheduled departure time came and went, I attempted to get assistance from the staff. The answer was &apos;the bus is delayed, we don&apos;t know why, what is wrong or what time it will come.&apos; hmm excellent! It was with a pleasant surprise they then announced its arrival, as we stood waiting, before giving up and sitting down again with no sign of any bus! About midday it arrived and with pleasure to be going, but a slight trepidation of what may occur next we were on our way!







The roads were a pleasant mix of bitumen and then back to dirt and potholes, but luckily I was so exhausted I managed to sleep on and off for most of the way. As darkness descended and the air became chilly I was wondering why it was so cold when all the windows were broken and jammed shut. I then realised the side of the bus was coming apart and the panel next to me had about a 1cm gap between where it should have been and where it was open to the outside as the air gushed in. Nice!







Although all i wanted to do was sleep, for some reason now everyone wanted to sit next to me and my disinterested look and sighs of &apos;oh is the rest of the bus full?&apos; when people tried to sit down was no deterrent. I amassed a pile of 4 business cards from this trip alone!







About 9pm or so in the pitch black we hit the Kenyan-Ugandan border. This one was even more remote and with less infrastructure than the last as we walked through the darkness, over giant pot holes filled with water and muddy ground. I was also much more scared at this one, maybe as there were less people on the bus, maybe as it was more remote, maybe as there were more touts, maybe because there were no other foreigners? Either way I couldn&apos;t get out of there fast enough! If only we had left on time it would have still been light!! The Ugandan immigration was also so sour faced and I could not hear him over the noise of his tv he was more interested in watching than doing his job processing. Apparantly I couldn&apos;t get a transit visa and I couldn&apos;t get a multiple entry visa. Apparantly! Hmmm. But what can you do?! Goodbye 50USD! They also spent forever clearing everything that was on the bus as well. Ridicuously thorough.







Back on the bus we hit a few small towns before Kampala, Uganda, the main transit point at about 1am. But nope, still no toilet stops! And someone had also stolen my bottle of water which was really really annoying as I had no Ugandian money and had to dehydrate until we got into Rwanda and I could get some money changed! Argh!







Finally we arrived at the Ugandan-Rwandan border and thankfully it was light!!! We had passed a massive massive queue of petrol tankers stretching kilometres and kilometres back and also overshot the Ugandian exit booth as we accidently walked through to Rwanda and then had to double back, much to the annoyance of the guards. Their fault though I say, if they were vigilent they would have stopped us the first time! My current seatmate had taken it upon himself to look after me and ushered the touts away and me into the massive queue. We then had another large walk over to Rwanda where passing my passport through the slot I was asked where my visa was and then told I needed to apply online, wait for it to be processed and had to return to Kampala to do this. I was dead confused as a hundred other travelers, the guidebooks, bus and travel companies had all said you can get this at the border. I think he then detected the absolute fear in my eyes at the thought I would be left there....And the fact we both knew it was the unsafest thing in the world that could possibly happen. I began to think and talk really fast and I am not sure exactly how it happened, but after an interrogation he decided that it could be processed. And at the standard fee of 60USD too. So freaking lucky. Some guys off the bus ran to tell the driver to hold the bus and about half an hour later I had my passport back and was through. Very very lucky. I was so petrified, I dread to think what would have happened if I had been abandoned and left at a freaking remote African border crossing!!! No thankyou!!!!!







I later met another traveler who told me that Apparantly this is a new requirement  for just a few countries as at 01 nov... But the website isn&apos;t even updated to accomodate this! Handy!







Breathing a massive sigh of relief and thinking for the first tine in 3 days that i might actually made it to Rwanda alive, it was a deFinite weight of my shoulders as I began to look around and appreciate the view. The countryside was gorgeous, so green, hilly and full of various types of pretty vegetation..... And then, about 11am and many hours behind schedule we arrived in Kigali, Rwanda&apos;s capital.







As I attempted to change money, taxi drivers crowded around me and all just laughed as I asked them to wait outside. I asked the exchange guy how much the taxi should be to the hostel and was told 3000 Rwandan Franks. So no surprise that I was told 10000 from the taxi driver. Trying to enlist the help of the exchange guy again, he just joined in laughing and said 7000 as it was really far. Jerk!





Arriving at the first and only Rwandan Youth Hostel I waited for reception to arrive as they then told me there was an error and there was no space available, even though the website said there was. She directed me to another hostel and arranged a taxi there. I had since found out another traveller had paid 5000 for the journey and also had been ripped off as someone else also said it should have been 3000. So annoying when there is nothng you can do!!!





I was told the taxi would be 2500, but not surprisingly he would not settle for less than 3000. As the reception chick couldn&apos;t really explain the address as there are no street names I was annoyed as I got into the cab. We arrived at what looked like a standard house  in the middle if the suburbs, and with flashbacks of Ethiopia,  I was about to ask the taxi driver if he wanted to just save us both time and mug me there and then; when i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. The guard didn&apos;t speak English as he showed me inside the house to a bedroom and then gave me his phone as the landlord was on it. It was the weirdest situation, and said I wasn&apos;t happy to stay. There was a Canadian girl on the couch who said there was no meals available, no Internet, there was no address so you had to memorise the route, therefore no taxi could come, you had to walk about an hour into town, or wander the streets until you found one of those crazy  dangerous motorbike taxis, oh and it wasn&apos;t safe at night. I was so angry that they had just taken me there, I just picked up my backpack and walked out.







Kigali is located on several hills and I could see the main hill of town ahead. Into the rain I walked up and down massive hills for almost 2 hours until I was finally where I wanted to be to get new accomodation. As I asked someone who just randomly pointed, another lady came over, told me to disregard the last person and walked me directly to the hotel as she lived just a few doors down. So nice!





I was shattered and over it and would have killed for water as I quickly found the supermarket and downed a bottle after having not drunk pretty much anything in the last 24 hours. And so I had made it! Breakdowns, Borders, over 3 days on buses, and everything else with only random stuff stolen- water, spare padlocks and plastic bags! But alive and well. Thank goodness!! :) Oh and a giant thumbs down for the Akamba bus which had started out so promising!!!
 
The land of a thousand hills, no dust :-) semi normality, local family,&amp;the genocide.

2010-11-13 to 2010-11-16

Kigali, Rwanda is definitely better laid out, better infrastructure and much more western than any other African city I have been to this far.  Unfortunately this also means much more expensive! There is still a massive fully armed police and military presence everywhere, but I did feel safer here than I had in most other places. There is also a massive amount of westeners, again more than I had seen anywhere else thus far so that made it a little easier to fit in as well! Oh and less dust, which my lungs are very grateful for!!





There is also a shopping centre with a large ( well by African standards!) supermarket that had things like yoghurt! Luxury! And free wifi! Well, it was attached to a coffeeshop, but if you stood outside the door... Free! :) Also, 1 USD= 591 Rwandan Frank. Such crazy conversions!





After 13 hours sleep my alarm woke me up! Whoa, I hope this wears off soon! I headed up to the Tourist Information centre which is one of my top nominations for most unhelpful place yet! I returned to the coffee shop and googled Kigali to work out my plan!!!!





I firstly visited the Hotel Des Milles Collines right in the middle of the city, which is the hotel depicted in the Hollywood movie &apos;Hotel Rwanda&apos; where thousands of locals fled for safety during the genocide was it was protected by UNAMIR (United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda) troops. As far as i could tell there was nothing at all there to indicate what had happened and as it was really busy inside I did not have the opportunity to speak to anyone.





I started to walk to the Kigali Genocide Memorial, also known as the Gisoz Genocide Memorial; but after half an hour discovered my dodgy map was not at all to scale! It also only had main roads that were at different angles on the map to where they actually lay! I surprised myself by making it in about 45 mins as it suddenly popped out of nowhere on the hill in front of me. Inside, the reception chick tried to bully me into paying by insisting I had to get an audio guide for 25USD or hire a guide for something like a hundred! I knew the museum was free and told her at which point she knew she had lost, but pointed to the donations box and said I had to leave money! So rude! It made me want to not leave my &apos;voluntary&apos; donation but after seeing the museum I wanted to anyway in spite of her!





The museum was really interesting, and coming from a non museum person this means a lot! It used pictures and movies as the main information source and then had written information in several different languages. It was really interesting to see how it painted the picture that how prior to colonisation, the Hutu and Tutsi people lived side by side in total harmony and Rwanda as a whole was peaceful.... (okay....! Forgetting the inter tribal wars and wars eith Burundi) but colonisation, particularly by the Belgiums created and sponsored a divide that ultimately led to the civil war, (which it also says the French pretty much single handedly armed! .... Hmmm.... What about Uganda hey!!! ) millions of refugees (estimated at 7 million of the 9 million population) tutsi vs hutu events of the 1990s and then the massive genocide in 1994 where some sources say up to a million people were brutally murdered.





It was only later when I was reading an impartial history that I realised how one sided the museum was, painting a picture of an entirely innocent country that was the victim of colonisation. Now, I am not saying there wernt problems with the way in which colonisation happened (easy with the benefit of hindsight!) but I think we are forgetting a massive amount of Tutsi vs Hutu and other lead up events.





It was quite chilling to see how the museum showed how friends and neighbours turned on each other and became cold blooded murderers, rapists and torturers. There is also a focus on children in one area and details how a few were killed, smashed against a wall, butchered by machetes, shot in the head to name a few. So Disgusting. There is also rooms with dozens and dozens of skulls, some even with holes where they may have been killed and photos family members have supplied of loved ones. At times whole entire families were wiped out which means there are no photos or anything. So sad.







In the gardens outside there are also dozens of mass graves which remain as the final resting place for so many thousands of people that were tragically murdered.







It&apos;s strange how there is no universal &apos;African&apos; language, but the word &apos;mzungu&apos; for White foreigner manages to cross every border! I hear it so often I am starting to wonder if it is my name!  :)



I was staying at Auberge la Caverne on Blvd de Nuabugogo; And as I chillaxed in my room the phone rang and reception said there was someone to see me. Confused I headed upstairs where the reception guy told me there was a man who knew me, my name and room number, he thought he was a driver.  This majorly majorly freaked me out as I had walked there and knew no man who should have known anything!! Reception said the man had been called away and would be back in a few minutes. I went back, made sure my door was locked and waited....! A few minutes later reception called all apologetic, he meant it was a lady! The one who had shown me here yesterday! Relieved i headed upstairs. How could he have confused that so badly???!!!





Sundi checked if all was going okay and invited me to the hotel bar for a drink. Finding it full of men watching football she then invited me to her house instead. She had pointed it out the other day when i had arrived, and it was literally just 15 metres away but I quickly disposed of all valuables just in case!







I met her husband J, her three children sebastian, giselle, lukshumae (cherie) and mother Bernadette as they chatted, got me a drink and snacks! So lovely! Sundi is Rwandan, but with a Belgium father, and J is originally from Punjab in India.







We also then randomly discovered that I had been working off the wrong time since I had arrived as Rwanda was an hour behind! Oops! But truly, not speaking the language of either Kinyarwanda or French how on earth could I have known that?! Just lucky I found out now before I missed something important... Like my ride outta here! :)







After chatting for a while, Sundi and J invited me out to dinner as we walked about 20mins down the road, watching the gorgeous lights of Kigali light up across the hills until we arrived at the zaffaran Indian restaurant. We had a delicious dinner and rolled home stuffed, but already with plans to meet the next morning! Such a random meetup, but such lovely people!







Bright and early Sundi and I met and headed to wards the local mini bus pick  up. We caught the Virunga Minibus and settled in for our 3 hour drive north west where I definitely saw how Rwanda got it&apos;s name as &apos;Land of a thousand hills&apos;. They are totally beautiful and so green and full of terraced farming, it was a spectacular drive.







We drove through Ruhengen and headed west to Gisenyi, which is a border town with Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We could see the Congo just directly in front of us, no more than a few minutes away. We caught &apos;motos&apos;, the local motorbike taxis which was soooo much fun and had a drink at Sundi&apos;s friends bar, where we also briefly chatted to some Tanzanian film stars that came in. No, I&apos;m afraid I didn&apos;t recognise them, but the others did!







We walked down to Lake Kivu, a massive, massive lake bordering the countries, and just so pretty with all the green trees and mountains around it. We headed inside the Lake Kivu Serena hotel where we made ourselves comfortable in their park that ran down to the waters edge. So lovely!!!! We had a great time chillaxing, swimming in the lake and then eating delicious home made burgers... And salad! Yay!  So exciting! I think it may be the first salad I have seen in a month!!!! Although lucky we were occupied swimming as i reckon they took about an hour to arrive!







Unfortunately the rain clouds looked ominous and it was also time for us to head back to Kigali. We jumped in another Moto taxi for another super fun ride back to the bus station!







We headed back to Kigali on the Belvedere minibus... The other one was totally full!! Popular route for having mini buses leaving every half hour! We could see the volcano that had erupted decades ago causing so much damage, and most recently again in 2001. Along the Rwanda/DRC border there are a string of 7 volcanoes, one rising up to almost 4500m, and sitting amongst the green rainforest, they look spectacular! This was also where Dian Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist) lived until she was murdered in 1985.





It was dark by the time we arrived back, and although the roads in most were really good, I was glad to have survived the constant sudden and drastic swerving to avoid things, animals, cars, people! As we passed by our street the driver kindly dropped us off right outside! So convenient!





Sundi immediately invited me in for dinner with the family and we had a delicious Indian feast! Mmm so good! I was quite fortunate to run into Sundi that first day as i was having a fantastic time hanging out with them all, and not to mention the amazing food certainly beat eating bread every meal!







And then the next morning happened! My room phone started ringing and ringing non stop. I answered it, but had no idea what the reception guy was saying. I then just ignored it as I wanted to sleep and I knew it had to be Sundi. And going and going and going.... I finally walked up to reception where the guy handed me a mobile phone, which then started to ring. I answered and it was Sundi saying she had left the mobile for me so she could always contact me. She then called back and said to bring my washing over, and then again to tell me to check out and stay with her, both of which I politely declined, which she was not happy about! She then wanted to know what I was doing, to which i responded I was going into town. And I was then told &apos;half an hour. We go&apos;. I said I was going now as I had things I wanted to do myself and it took about ten minutes to get through and I was getting so frustrated!! I was finally free and on my way and feeling so suffocated! I was looking forward to just doing what I wanted and my own thing and I wasn&apos;t allowed to!!!







I was also absolutely dreading the 24 hour bus trip back and border crossings, so I decided to take a flight.... Until I found they are almost 400USD vs 38!!!! Damn. Bus it is :( I looked around for possible flights and as I sat in the Rwanda Air office for about 45 waiting to be served the phone rang again, and again! Asking where I was, I was told to wait there and she would come down. I again spent another ten minutes telling her no, that I did not need her and was told to come over as soon as I was done.





The cash machines then all decided to break down and I spent a good hour walking around the city trying to find one that worked, petrified I would be stuck in the city as I couldn&apos;t get money to get a bus ticket out! Eventually I found one, purchased a bus ticket, and exhausted I summed up the enthusiasm to drop by Sundi&apos;s.





I had made a passing comment previously that i liked to eat dahl and so as I arrived I was told, &apos;where were you?&apos; we made dahl especially and have been waiting and waiting for you so we can eat lunch.&apos; ahhhh. So we had lunch and I was told how easy it was to get Rwandan visas and where I could get a job and how they would help me.... It was all getting too much and I tried to get going on several occasions, finally managing!







Whilst I was in Rwanda I really wanted to head out to see the churches such as Nyamata where thousands fled for safety during the genocide, but were then brutally murdered inside. But... Each time I had tried Sundi had come up with a different plan and as I was flexible I just went with the flow. But as it was my last day I reslly wanted to get there. By the time I left the house and got to the bus station I was  being followed by this one guy and there was another in a hood on every corner I turned. Starting to feel a bit uneasy, I went into several bus offices, but with the amazing customer service skills they possessed struggled to get anything! Apparantly I could catch a bus out, but couldn&apos;t leave for an hour, and then there were no buses back. I was way over it at this point and headed back into the city main and tried tourist info again to find the familie church and memorial to the peacekeepers killed. Not surprisingly they couldn&apos;t point them out on the map and the horribly vague directions they gave had me walking in circles for an hour to no avail. And then the worst stomach cramps hit me and I struggled home to bed, feeling like the longest walk of my life! Damn African sicknesses i cant shake!!! As I took some tablets and curled up in bed the phone again started constantly. Ready to hurl it out the window as it refused to relent I explained I was sick but was told to just come over soon.





I needed to return the phone and about an hour and a half later struggled out of bed and down the street where I was welcommed with open arms and told they were cooking dinner for me. Exhausted I sank into a chair and watched the TV whilst chatting with the kids. I planned to go straight away, but just couldn&apos;t as Sundi was so excited to see me and cooking a feast. We had a lovely dinner Sundi and her mum Bernadette had prepared and I prepared to say goodbye as Sundi started telling me she would get a taxi to go with me to the bus station at 5am. I really wanted to walk, did not want to pay for a taxi and did not need or want anyone to take me! Finally age relented, but wow!! Sundi started yo get tears in her eyes saying goodbye and it made me realise that really she was just a really lonely housewife and I guess my life had offered her an escape for a few days. They were a really really lovely and sweet family and so very open and welcomming but I was really ready to have my own life back! If there is one thing I cannot stand, it is being suffocated! I wrote a lovely little thankyou card and left some cool stickers for the kids outside the door for them to find later and headed off on my own!
 
Overland! And the 1 bus driver!!! Kigali, Rwanda to Nairobi, Kenya, via Kampala, Uganda!

2010-11-17 to 2010-11-18

My original plan had been to head down to Burundi whilst I was here, but i truly could not face another 12 painful hours on the bus, another border and another $120USD in visas!!! (60 each country!) I also wasn&apos;t convinced Rwanda would let me back in and as I had to pass through Kigali whichever way I decided to go to Nairobi, it just wasn&apos;t worth it! Disappointing, but at least it gave me a little time to chillax before  I was about to start my Safari and try and snap out of my nausea and constant tiredness. With Diamox out of the equation, it was time to blame Doxy, kilimanjaro... Or my crappy diet consisting of maximum 2 meals a day and 95% of carbohydrate as it was cheap, easy to get and safe!







Up at the crack of dawn I began walking as the colours of the sun rose over the city. The bus &apos;station&apos; at Nyabugogo was actually a lot further than I thought and I sped up to arrive, board and within 5 mins we were gone! On time! Clearly Kampala Coaches was the way to travel!







I sat next to an American girl called Lauren who was a teacher and writing her thesis on East African countries, and had an awesome trip to Kampala! Worlds away from my last experience! Even the border was quick and efficient and definitely a thousand times nicer in daylight!!!





It was funny though, as soon as we crossed the border from Rwanda into Uganda we immediately began driving on the left hand side of the road, instead of the right! It was also really apparent the difference in the countryside as well, with less hills, less rainforest,  back to the kind of more shanty houses and red dirt everywhere! It was also much less developed and progressed.





Very quickly we were at our first major stop, Kampala, Uganda which was a much, much larger city than I expected and where I sadly said goodbye to Lauren. The conductor told us to &apos;eat yourself&apos; and get back on the bus to Nairobi. And that was it! Enquiring how long we had we were given 20, no 15 minutes, hurry! And in the middle of nothing! Lauren and I raced down the road to try to find a Fourex, exchange money, get something to eat and get back in time for me to catch the bus. The people in the supermarket were ridiculously slow and so no food was going to happen. I waved Lauren off and sped back to find the bus still there so told the conductor i needed the bathroom, who waved somewhere randomly, told me &apos;hurry!&apos; &apos;Nairobi now!&apos; and ran off. I ran to find this random bathroom, finally succeeded in the kind of practically opposite direction to his gesture and ran back onto the bus. I was greeted with a totally full bus of big Ugandan men! The guys who had asked if our seat was free as we jumped off and specifically left things on it saying we were coming back were sitting there, and I walked aimlessly up the bus finding nowhere til I cracked it and all of the sudden a few people pointed me to a seat and after intense questioning, the guy there finally moved all his stuff so I could sit down. And it turned out to be Mr Chatty who had talked to us nonstop at the border. Although I was initially annoyed as I tried to chillax, Dennis actually turned out to really nice and looked out for me through the Borders and touts.







And then a lady in a &apos;kampala catering&apos; apron came down the aisle handing out meals to everyone! Argh again! So we had run across town for nothing!!





The bus was ridicuously hot with no air and soon became super stuffy and stunk! And made me even more grumpy as I realised how Angry Africa was making me! So could not wait to get on Safari, be surrounded by normal people again, stop being a giant novelty for everyone and pay someone else to deal with the real Africa crap!!!!!!



I am not sure whether it was the bus as I was sitting right down the back, or whether the Kenyan and Ugandan governments need yo work on their roads, but it was so ridiculously bumpy it bounced you out of your seat and made it impossible to sleep. My seatbelt was broken as I had to tie it to the side of the seat to try and keep myself in my seat!





We arrived at the Ugandan/Kenyan border in the pitch black and rain... My favourite way to cross Borders! Ahh the Ugandan border is a nightmare! We weaved through a mass of trucks stopped in random places, that i have no idea how will get out, jumped over massive potholes filled wither water and sloshes through the mud to the &apos;queue&apos; - and I use that word very loosely! - the mass of people milling around, pushing in front and then when we got to the front of the line were told it was the wrong window, even though there were no signs! Finally, finally we were processed, braved the money exchange touts and again weaved between trucks and massive rivers to get to Kenya, get a stamp and through! Thank you Kenya for making life easy! With no view of our bus, we walked several hundred metres and came across it beeping it&apos;s horn for us to get on and go!







We bounced along for about another 8 hours, vainly attemping to sleep, but failing dismally! But then we pulled up to Nairobi..... Early! About 0520h! Wow!!! Kampala coaches is definitely the way forward! Although saying thanks to the driver and conductor I was shocked. I assumed they had swapped at one of the Kampala offices we had stopped at on the way, but nope- it was the same guys who had started in Kigali 24 hours ago!!!!!!! Holy crap!!!!! Apparantly that is how it is done!!! Lucky we made it alive!
 
Corruption? Cheetahs and meat overload. Nairobi, Kenya

2010-11-18 to 2010-11-20

I arrived at the comfort hotel where I was staying and my card didn&apos;t work in their machine. Either I was really tired (highly possible!), or she told me it was 60000 shillings. Now, having been in places where this was a reasonable amount, I went walking through the dark to the ATM they indicated. The machine limit was 20000. Even then this didn&apos;t click as I walked further into the dark looking for another. Even the limit of 40000 still didn&apos;t click as I just resigned myself to two transactions. It was only when the massive wad of bills came out did I start to think something was not right. I hurried back to the hotel before anything happened and she confirmed 6000 for the room. Oops! I just withdrew 500USD instead of 50. Damn it, something more to carry around for the muggers!! :).





I actually quite like Nairobi more than most cities so far in Africa. It has armed police and security everywhere, quite a lot in the city, no dust!!!!  and you can walk around without getting hassled TOO much which is always nice!!





It was also nice my ankles were much more quickly returning to normal after spending 3 days puffy and swollen sfter my 3 day epic bus trip to Rwanda last week!





I was waiting in my room that evening when the phone rang and reception gave some encrypted message and i then hear a hello? Who&apos;s this?! Monty and Mick had arrived! It was quite funny as the hotel were SO confused! At the airport Monty and Mick had found not their name, but mine on the board someone was holding up for their transfer, but when I had tried to check in, monty, Mick and Danae, another friends names were on the booking! Even though I had booked the rooms! So confused!





It was SO awesome to see the guys again!! The next morning we headed out to the Animal Orphanage. Kenya Wildlife Service Animal Orphanage ( Www.kws.go.ke ) The orphanage houses formerly wild animals that have been recovered by park rangers for various reasons. We saw heaps of cute and awesome animals – cheetahs, leopards, lion cubs, lions and lionesses, warthogs, baboons, various monkey species, hyenas, jackals and crocodiles and a random wild cat. It was so funny though, as we stood there taking photos of the animals, African school children stood there taking photos of us!!!







A couple of workers approached us asking if we wanted to go into the enclosure with cheetahs!! We paid 1000 Kenya shillings each (about 12.50USD),  were ushered in quickly and told to hurry! They got a little impatient when we were fiddling with our cameras and Mick saw they had stationed people on the sides of the walkway. It was super cool being inside with three 18 month old cubs and they were so docile we could just walk right up and pat them!!!! So cool!!! As we left the enclosure, the employee who had let us him told us &quot;if anyone asks where you got the photo, it wasn’t here&quot;. Proof the money goes straight to their pockets! And in total contradiction to the sign at the entrance of the park stating the Animal Orphanage is a corruption free zone!! Too funny!!!







We walked about half an hour back towards to the city and had lunch at a place called Carnivores. (www.tamarind.co.ke )  It is world-famous and has twice been voted among the 50 best restaurants in the world! This was probably due to the number of exotic game meat you could get on the menu in previous years, but in 2004, the Kenya government banned the sale of game meat so we contented ourselves with beef, pork, lamb, chicken, ostrich and turkey that was roasted in massive chunks on skewers over coals, and then carried around the restaurant by waiters carving it off the hunk on the skewer direct onto your plate! It was such an awesome feed! And surprisingly enough my favourites were the ostrich and chicken. Amazing! Once you could no longer eat any more you placed the little White flag on your table down to surrender and they stopped bringing the meat around. So much fun!







Monty and Mick were on a different safari to me and had their pre departure meeting as they were off the next morning! It was great to see them, but going to get better as we would cross several times along the way.





Making use of the hot never ending water shower I spent about 2 hours pulling all the African braids out of my hair that I had had in for the last month and then about another hour in the shower trying to get all the fake hair and tangles out! It almost sent me bald!





I then caught up with Danae, a friend from Topdeck who was on the African tour with me and had a nice chilled day organising before it was time for our pre departure meeting!!!! Safari time!!!!
 
Safari!!!!!

2010-11-20 to 2010-11-24

We arrived at our pre deaparture meeting to hear the details of our safari with East Africa Travel company that was to depart the next morning. The start of 56 days on an overland truck!!!!





Danae, another Topdeck friend Owen and I met our fellow passengers, 20 in total I believe and heard the details of the start of our journey north to Uganda to trek with the gorillas.





Not sure how much I will be on the Internet, but don&apos;t worry, all is well and I am definitely safe I am now with a group!!! Yay!!!! :)
 
Nairobi to Masai Mara, Kenya &apos;You want to go for a run?! Aren&apos;t you scared of lions?!!!&apos;

2010-11-21

Nairobi to Masai Mara, Kenya &apos;You want to go for a run?! Aren&apos;t you scared of lions?!!!&apos;



We left the Comfort Hotel and walked to the Boulevard ready to Safari! We found our big green truck that was to be home for the next 56 days, saw our Kenyan driver Alois and cook Darren, and also our friends Sammi and Al (who we work with at Topdeck) who were doing their tour in the opposite direction and we were all heading north to do the Gorillas together!





We headed out and came across an awesome viewpoint overlooking The Great Rift Valley where two techtonic plates collided milions of years ago and created the mountains of Kilimanjaro and Meru and the valley where the earth collapsed in once they reseperated. Which was just stunning!!! And massive!!!







And then out of the blue there were giraffes!!!!! Amazing!!!!! And then along the way thompsons gazelle, various birdlife, vervet monkeys, wildebeast.... And goats!!!! Hundreds and hundreds of goats!!!!







We had our first lunch, salad and sandwiches, so tasty and normal! :) and the sun so hot beating down the bread turned to toast instantaneously in front of us!





We amused ourselves with Cards for several hours as we cross crossed from one side if the road to the other to try and avoid the massive potholes! The roads were really Bumpy bumpy roads though!!





The Terrain was exactly how you would imagine Africa, the Umbrella Acacia trees, the colours, the environment, everything!







We saw many little Masai villages, made up of several mud brick houses and fences to keep the wild animals out!!







And then, Danae tried to take a photo out the wondow and these three Masai women started throwing big rocks at the truck!!! Lucky they were crap shots so No damage though!! :)





We then entered Masai land where we saw locals attending to their cattle from the side of the road.







We attempted to drive into Acacia campsite, but it took some time!! The &apos;roads&apos; were SO dodgy!! It was across creeklines and we slowly slowly crawled forward, spun wheels and with the help of some local Masai eventually got there!





Acacia camp looks on to the Meguatra hills and the stream at the bottom forms a natural border of the Masai Mara National Reserve.





The gate was closed after the truck and we were told not to venture out without a Masai with us due to lions, elephants and who knows what else! Yup, now in the real Africa!!! :)





We were lucky enough to get pre erected tents for our first night which was a nice surprise! We sorted out our stuff, did some stretches with Danae and Sammi and then Owen and I went for a run. When the crew saw me in my workout gear they looked at me- &apos;You want to go for a run?! Aren&apos;t you scared of lions?!!!&apos; needless to say we didn&apos;t leave the safety of our fenced campsite!



It was quite a cool campsite, The Hot water tank was on top of a large fire that provided the heating for the water. And such a nice shower! And a fire for our cook to cook dinner on as well, rice and chicken and veg which was delicious.

Masai Mara, the amazing wildlife and warriers. Kenya

2010-11-22

2 km  and half hour to travel!! That&apos;s how bumpy the roads were as we left our campsite at 0630h. We were headed on our first game safari through the Masai Mara, the northern, and Kenyan part of the massive Tanzanian Serengeti. And we were Driving through huge plains, rolling hills, and an abundance of game matched nowhere else on earth.





It was an amazing start to the trip with hundreds of Herds of zebras, running next to us as we drove slowly through the park we came across

Thompsons gazelle (smaller ones with a black stripe), these awesome Giraffe just walking down the road in front of us, stopping to ear along the way! We saw 2 Heartbeast or maybe topi (?!) fighting, then herds of Topi, cute little Warthog families running around, and then Elephants!!! The first ones were from a distance as we stopped the truck and all cranes to pick them out from thectrees, but as we continued along the way we came across many more right next to us, including babies!





Amongst the zebra, we saw herds of Wilderbeast, Grants gazelles (larger),

Impalas... That look just like grants gazelles from a distance! Water buffalo, and then Lions!!! There were 3 females lying in the sun and then walking around, it was so cool!







There were Baboons, Jackals, a Tortoise, Ostrichs, Mongoose family (hard to see as they were so quick in the shrubbery), the beautiful Uganda crowned crane and lots of birds such as the secretary bird, ground hornbills, guinea fowl, and lots of little ones!







Pulling up to a concrete block with K and T on the top, we were at the border of Kenya and Tanzania. We then stopped at a big stream that was full of hippos!!  It was about midday and quite warm, so they were all under the water, just popping their nostrils up to breathe or poking their heads our to yawn. The few times any surfaced we saw how massive they were! Can&apos;t wait to see them out of the water! We also saw a big, maybe 4m crocodile sitting on the bank before sliding into the war, the hippos totally unperterbed!





About 20m upstream was also the place that the wildebeasts cross on the great migration each year and are snapped up by the crocodiles!







There was a bunch of armed rangers watching us the while time to protect us, ready just in case anything came towards us!





I was on food prep duty and so did the chopping and slicing and washing up for the fresh salad sandwiches, Al on monkey duty scaring them off before they came to jump on us, steal our food or give is rabies!!





We then began our Return through the Masai Mara and saw the Serval! The truck came to a stop and we heard the driver Alois yell &apos;cheetah!!!&apos; we all jumped up from our various states of slumping in our seats. Its amazing how soon you tire of seeing the animals! Mind you, we were there for almost 10 hours all up!!! We were all pressed to one side, yelling out target indications until we all saw it running to our left, a herd of thompsons gazelle running the opposite way, and then realising they were safe, bulack tiwards it where they were! Through zoomed photos we realised it was a Serval, a very rare find, and it kind of a smaller version of a cheetah and with spots and stripes. Awesome!!





Just before we arrived into camp we were dropped off at a Masai village. The chief&apos;s son, alex ( english name- his Masai name I don&apos;t remember!) met us with several other Masai men and took us through the stick fence boundary of their village. We were first shown how they make fire with sticks and then how they use the sticks to burn tattoos onto their arms for decoration.





Next was to the large paddock in the centre of the village where the whole village cows are kept safe overnight. In the centre was a large stick where the village gather when required and also where circumcisions are performed. These are still preformed on women, even though there is starting to be a move against it in the country. The boys are circumcised at age 14 surrounded by other village boys/men to judge howstrong they are. Uf they are weak, I.e., they scream or cry in pain, they bring disrespect on their family and then have to fight to prove their worth or the other boys will not take him in their group out to the bush.







At the age of 15-18 years, the boys are sent out into the bush for 3 years to become Masai Warriers. During this time they must kill a male lion and bring back it&apos;s mane to the village made into a bag.





Marriages are prearranged, the girls usually around 17 and the men around 22. The men are polygamous though and may have as many wives as he can pay 10 cows for! The women are not!





The women build the houses out of cow dung and they last for 9 years, when the village then moves on several kilometers to a new location. We went inside of of the houses - there is a central fire that warms and where the cooking is done, about 2-3m across; then a few small rooms for the parents, the children, the guests and the baby calves to keep them safe at night!





The women then performed two traditional songs for us and  We then saw their Market which had a lot of quite cool beaded bracelets, red Masai blankets and various carved items. Anna made a joke to me about asking for the beaded bracelet of the chief&apos;s son and within 5 seconds he was there asking how much we wanted to pay for it!!! Ridiculously good hearing!!







The School was located right next to the village and is the predetermining factor for where the next village location is as they need to be on several km of it gor the children to attend. We went into one of the classrooms full of wooden pews and a blackboard painted onto the wall.







We also learnt that the stretched Ears are a sign of decoration for those who have not gone to school; and Masai wear red as it is a threatening colour for the wild animals.





The Masai Warriers escorted us for about 20 mins for the walk back to our campsite and it was time for my groups allocated task if food prep duty. There wasn&apos;t that much to do, but there were lactose olibtolerant in our group and so we spent about half an hour mashing potatoes and veggie together for almost 30 people without any liquid! Took forever!





After dinner we all sat around the campfire as the Masai warriers came to perform traditional dances for us. They were so cool, using their voices to produce so many different sounds they all harmonised together and sounded like they were killing sething!! There were several different dances, two that I remember being for after a lion is killed, and another performed at weddings. There was also lots of High jumping which was really really cool to watch. They even have championships between the tribes!





They then grabbed a few of us, me included, out of our seats, placed their red blankets and necklaces on us and taught us their dances which was heaps of fun.





As we lay in bed in our tents that night we heard sounds if all the wild animals round us. Quite cool... Whilst safely protected by our Masai Warriers :)
 
Long long drive days, Masai Mara to Kisumu, Kenya

2010-11-23 to 2010-11-24

Masai Mara to Kisumu, Kenya



Up in the dark again, we left the Masai Mara early in the morning, and jolted along some of what were apparantly the worst roads in Africa! We had a brief stop off on the town of Narok and then passed through kilometres of gorgeous green tea plantations of Kericho before descending the Rift Valley plateau.... And dying of hunger as we couldn&apos;t find anywhere along the descent where we could pull over for lunch, almost 8 hours after breakfast!!







We were then on our way to Kisumu, our destination for the night - Kenyas largest harbour town on the banks of Africa&apos;s largest lake, lake Victoria, the source of the White Nile. The town of Kisumu is the home of US President Barack Obama&apos;s grandparents!





Although it was just several hundred kilometers, it was a full day of driving in the truck, almost 11 hours all up as we played games to pass the time. We had a supermarket shop for the cook to get supplies where I was told by a local lady that women in Africa do not whistle, only men do!!!!!





It was our first night setting up our tents, and luckily they proved to be easy and nice and spacious, and our campsite was right on Lake Victoria and full of cotton, mango and other cool trees. Owen and I headed off for a run watching the beautiful colours of the sunset across the sky as we ran.





We had pasta, beef and veg for dinner and chilled out before listening to the sounds of so many animals as we drifted off to sleep.
 
On the road again. Kisumu, Kenya to Kampala, Uganda

2010-11-24

It was another early morning as we packed up everything and hit the road. We started making good time as we hit the border from Kenya into Uganda, they let our tour leader Amy collect all the passports and take them through and we were out in no time! Amazing! But then as we tried to maneouvre the truck through the maze of cars and enter Uganda, crunch! We had a collision with another truck! Doh! We had crashed into him, but he was in our lane, so apparantly his fault. Nevertheless it probably took almost an hour to sort out as we sat waiting!





The rest of the drive was nice and uneventful as we played games, had a local supermarket stop and arrived in the capital city, Kampala. Next stop, Red Chilli campsite! We arrived in to find the world&apos;s smallest pool, a super fat dog and scores of jackfruit trees. We played frisbee and had super crappy treakle cold water showers before feasting on rice, fish and delicious mashed pumpkin veg for dinner and sitting around having a few drinks.
 
Kampala to Kisoro and Lake Bunyoni, Uganda. Another long bus day, but the most beautiful campsite!!!

2010-11-25

After another super early morning departure, packing up in the pitch black of before 5am we departed Kampala, and had a super quiet drive through western Uganda as most of the bus passed out. Such a long day! It seemed to take forever but we got through a few card games and scategories after lunch which helped!





All along the way we saw all these Cows with massive horns, the biggest horned cows in the world apparantly, some like antlers they were so big which was quite cool!





Our supermarket stop was quite funny. Elections are on soon and there was a political rally in the little town we stopped at. The toilet was at the back of the supermarket and as we were let through we saw an open door that could not close, a pit of about a metre wide and who knows how deep filled with another brown unknown watery substance that you had to jump to get to the dirty totally blocked toilet totally covered in pee. Delightful!!!





After another long day of about 11 hours on the bus we arrived at Lake Bunyoni Overland - definitely the most amazing campsite I have ever been to as we pitched our tents just back from the water, overlooking the stunning lake (- Lake Bunyoni is the largest crater lake in Africa!!!), islands and nice and close to all the facilities! Perfect!!!







We had a delicious dinner of grilled chicken, and a potato, tomato veg dish with .... Plantanes, the green cooking bananas. I had had something similiar before in South America and not enjoyed them so was pleasantly surprised to find how delicious they were prepared &apos;duncan style&apos; by our cook!
 
Chasing Gorillas!!!! Lake Bunyonyi, Uganda

We breakfasted at 5am in the pitch black, excited for our big adventure off to find the Mountain Gorillas! .... There are only approx 700 of them left in the wild in Bwindi National Park in the South West of Uganda, where we were headed, and the national parks of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).





We split up into smaller groups and jumped into the vans that were to take us to Bwindi National Park to begin. Once the darkness lifted the drive was stunning, so green, beautiful terraced farm plots on the hills, the colours of sunrise shining through and a White mist covering all the low lying areas. Beautiful! Uganda is definitely the most pretty country I have seen in Africa!





We stopped a few times to admire the views and the amazing opportunity we had to see the stunning backdrop of about 5 of the line of 7 volcanoes that run almost along the Borders through Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC.





2 hours after we began we arrived at........ And met Godfry, our ranger guide who would be leading us on our trek. There was also another ranger armed with an AK47 ready in needed! I was a bit annoyed that although we had paid 580 USD that covered National Park fees, permits, transfers, conservation stuff, trackers, rangers etc; when we arrived we were told we needed to pay another 15 USD for porters. For a day hike!! Crazy!! But then he convinced the group we needed them because if anything happened that would be the only way we got out... Which is total crap! But what can you do.







The family we were seeing was the ....



We began our trek at 0830 and the rainforest was beautiful! But suddenly we were balancing on slippery rocks placed as stepping stones through massive deep mud rivers on the path, and then making almost vertical climbs up, tripping over trees, being caught up in vines, stung by stinging needles, and attacked by ants!





It was a tough very steep, kind of vertical uphill climb, but we were all excited to be there as we clawed our way through the rainforest, listening to our guide talking on the radio to the trackers who had left at 7am and were guiding us into the gorilla family. Several times we stopped and changed course slightly in accordance with where the gorillas now were. At one stage we had just come down a track when we stopped and were told that the gorrillas had moved from the valley they were in and we had to backtrack to kind of gut them off if we wanted to catch them. We backtracked the same way we had come and then stopped abruptly as our guide then got out his sickle type device and started hacking a new path for us to follow! We bushbashed until we joined up with an existing path which we were told that gorillas had just used, complete with fresh poo everywhere on it! And then we heard something! The first calls of the gorillas!!! We continued on as they got louder, and then in the distance we saw some black shadows high in the trees!!! We had found them!!





We dropped our backpacks and sticks as instructed and headed after the guides and machete weilding trackers. We walked under the gorillas as they sat high in the trees and threw fruit at us!! One berry even hit me in the head! Good shot :) as we continued walking several gorillas started to descend from the trees right in front of us!! Literally just 2 metres away!!! They were MASSIVE!!!! They seemed unperterbed as we crouched down as per the guides instructions and passed right by us. We watched others sitting down resting, eating leaves, then swinging up so easily up trees and acros branches. We follower them as they moved, seeing more and more until we found a point on the track where they seemed to be crossing, waitig for others and feeding as we all gathered there watching amazed. We saw females, juveniles, babies on mothers backs, blackbacks (the adult males), and the mighty silverbacks the males aged 12 years +. it was amazing!!!! We stood there for ages as we saw 19 different members of the family!!!!!! So so amazing!! We watched some hurl themselves and roll down the hill, another run with his arms waving king kong style into some kind of sommersault. It was amazing!!!!!









And then the wasps nest that the guides had been monitoring high up in the trees erupted and there were wasps everywhere!! We hightaled it out of there in the direction of the gorillas and saw a few more before the guides told us to hurry and as we watched the family walked past in a line on a trail directly olin front of us!!! A totally amazing procession of all ages!!!! There was a silverback at the end and as it passes a particular treestump, the dominant silverback of the family came back down and threatened him in a show if aggression. Apparantly the younger silverback was getting stronger and so the dominant silverback was just reminding him who was boss as he sat there for a few minutes afterwards waiting it out!! It was a bit weird though that as we were peering through the rainforest at the gorillas the rangers and trackers just chopped down everything they could reach between us and them so we could have clearer viewing. I thought it Very weird... if they do that every day there would be no forest left!







We continued to follow at a safe distance and then cut across so we could see them as they moved. We had a great location watching as they move past, and then a silverback just sat down in front of us!!! We moved in closer to watch him, and then he moved closer to us so he was probably a metre and a half away!!!!!!!! He just sat there eating, chilling out, laughing and watching us!!! It was totally unbelieveable and surreal!!!! We didn&apos;t want it to end, but we had already spent an hour and a half with the gorillas and we were only supposed to spend an hour so were really lucky. We  had never felt scared during the experience and felt so lucky to have been able to actually find and then watch the gorrillas in the wild. Some people trek all day and see nothing, if the gorillas are constantly on the move or too far away from the start point and go the other direction, so we definitely felt lucky! Additionally only 8 people maximum can trek at once and there are only a few families that can be watched, so it is a very rare opportunity that I hope the Ugandan work with protection and conservation can continue and people in the future can have the opportunity to see these amazing creatures also.







The guides finally managed to drag us away and we had an hour hike back to where the porters were meeting us, we sat down to a well deserved lunch... About 7 and a half hours after brekky, and then another hour and a half hike back down the crazy steep hill, received our trekking certificates and we were back into the car for another 2 hour drive back to our campsite, Lake Bunyoni overland arriving about 4:30... So an 11 hour day, but so worth it!







Between washing and chilling out, sitting by the lake and swapping stories it was almost time for dinner when I hear someone say &apos;hey there&apos;s a familiar face!&apos; and out popped Monty and Mick! Their overland truck had just turned up! We had a quick catchup, went our seperate ways for our allocated chores and dinner (veg curry soup, delicious spiced pilau rice and beef strogonof with eggplant... But not creamy!) before having a quiz night in the bar and then a drink with Mick and Monty. So good!
 
Life at Lake Bunyonyi, Uganda

2010-11-27

We had our first sleep in of the tour! Breakfast at 8 which was a nice treat, and a free day! In Africa there are no washing machines so it was nice to have some time to handwash everything... Even if it did then totally pour down in the afternoon! Double wash! :)



Jamie, Owen, Danae and I then went for a walk and ended up doing a massive steep hike up the hill behind the campsite and had the most amazing view over lake Bunyoni and the dozens of islands that are dotted all over it. We then walked down to a hotel  (Arcadia Cottages www.arcardiacottages.net  ) we had seen with an amazing balcony and view where we sat down for a drink on the deck overlooking the lake. So beautiful!!!!!!!!!





Definitely over children sticking their hands out and yelling &apos;give me money&apos; though. So annoying constantly!!!





It was almost lunch time and with Jamie and I on food prep we headed down to help out, to get there and discover everything done! The story of our duties so far! Can&apos;t complain !!! :)





The rainclouds opened above us as we scrambled for our washing and waited it out, attempting to stop the random pools of water in the tent from getting any more of our stuff!!





Of course the rain cleared just as it was time for food prep! The ground around our truck and cooktent had turned into a soggy muddy mess a few cm&apos;s deep that you could almost lose your thongs in, as we prepared veg and Jamie got told by our other group member Sharon his peeled potatoes were not round enough and he had to redo them!





We had a local speciality, barbequed goat, where our cook Duncan had picked up  3/4 of a goat at the local Market, marinaded it, chopped it into chunks and then cooked it over the fire. It looked gross raw, fatty and bony, and once it was cooked it was quite hard to find meaty sections, but once you did they were actually super tasty! Some bits were a bit tough, and others got caught in your teeth really badly, but a good bit was delicious! A far cry from the only other time I have had goat was when we killed it, bled it, skinned it and then ate it on survival training back at the Defence Gorce Academy! And yes, it was gross, tough and full of goat hair! Gross!





As soon as darkness descends, the beautiful grass of the campsite comes alive with thousands of these bugs that have a bright bright little round light in their tails. We have no idea what they are but are so pretty to watch!
 
Lake Bunyonyi, continued (sorry iPod difficult to write!) Uganda

2010-11-28

After a delightful rain- free night we breakfasted and went for a walk. We had directions to the local town, Kabale, and began along the red dirt red beside the beautiful lake. Very soon we were surrounded by local children wanting to hold our hands, ask constantly and incessantly &apos;how are yooooou?&apos; before the inevitable &apos;give me money!&apos; which drives me insane! I just spent the entire time holding me hand out and saying in return &apos;give ME money&apos; until they grew tired of it. So annoying when every kid you pass constantly does it!





We walked for an hour and a half, had come to nowhere and decided to turn back and brave the locals again. The views over the green terraced hills were beautiful and we came across several little churches with amazing singing coming out of them, but the begging was so annoying! The road was kind of dodgy too as I slipped over on the loose gravel and now have matched cut knees!





After lunch Danae, Owen and I took a local dug out canoe and paddled across the lake to Rabbit Island, this cool little island full of.... Rabbits :). They were so cute hopping everywhere and these were also heaps of amazing birds as we sat in this awesome little bar overlooking the lake, listening to music, having cold drinks and watching the wildlife! Too soon it was time to leave as we spun in circles for a bit before we got the hang of it again and canoe-ed back for a hot shower!!! Yay!!! Then catching up with Monty and Mick who had just returned from Gorilla trekking and had gone to see the exact same gorilla family I had! During their trek, one of the gorillas had charged the guide and they have this awesome and super scary picture of the chatging gorilla all blurry as hecwas moving so fast, baring all his sharp pointy teeth! Scary!



After lentils, chapati (savoury pancake bread) and cabbage for dinner we caught up in the bar before turning in ready to hit the road!
 
Lake Bunyonyi to Jinja, Uganda

2010-11-29

Lake Bunyonyi to Jinja, Uganda



We were getting quite efficient at packing down the tent in the dark as breakfast began at 5. Onto the bus and back onto the super bumpy roads as we waved goodbye to our lovely home on the shores of beautiful lake Bunyoni.





Many, many bumpy, hot hours later we arrived at the Equator, which was marked by 2 circles either side of the road with a N and S marking the northern and southern hemispheres where you could stand with one foot in each hemisphere. And not much else!





We had a packed lunch as we had so long to travel and arrived at the Nile High Campsite in Jinja about 5pm, after 11 hours driving!! And apparantly that was awesome time!



The campsite was amazing, right on the Nile and very green, and a bar overlooking it all. I was surprised by how wide the Nile was, as this is the White Nile, originating at Lake Victoria and not forming into the Nile proper until it joined with the Blue Nile at Khartum in Sudan. The Blue Nile I had visited in Ethiopia was about a quarter of the size! This was easily well over a hundred metres Wide and super fast flowing and hard to believe we would be rafting on that in the morning!





It was so nice to sit there, and listen to the thundering water of the River below us as we feasted on pap, the Kenyan version of maize meal ugali, or as I prefer to refer to it - playdough! Delicious delicious pumpkin and kale Which is like a coarse silverbeet, and meat.





We were ready for an early night with our White water rafting adventure!
 
Cheating death on the white water of the Nile, Jinja, Uganda

2010-11-30

We awoke early, ready to raft the Nile! Sitting in the bar waiting, we were wondering if the crew had had a big night and wondering how safe we would be as the meeting time came and went! That must be why they told us to take our watches off! :) But eventually we briefed, helmeted, suited up, and got into groups, there was either mild or wild and I chose the wild boat! I was a little bit aprehensive as when I had last rafted at summer camp in the US, one of our kids had been flipped out and sucked under the raft when we got stuck on a rock. He was fine, but super scary. Several passengers had also passed away being stuck under rocks white water rafting in Switzerland last year so I was a little rattled.







We walked down the stairs from camp and as soon as we got on the water though it was totally fine, just as super fun as I remembered and I could not wait to get going! We practiced our safety, rescue and rapid drills and then jumped in and floated down the second rapid in the water which was so much fun.







The rapids ranged from grade 2 to grade 5, with a grade 6 in the middle that we had to paddle to the side, get out and walk around, and so glad we did as it looked ferocious!!! There was crazy White water everywhere, a ridiculous super strong current pushing everything, the water barreling, rocks, water being sucked down and spewed back up and.... Wow!!! Walking on our soggy, soft, waterlogged feet across the &apos;extreme&apos; rocks was painful enough, letalone having to raft that!







Our tour was split into 2 boats, our wild, or as we called it, team extreme, and the girls boat which was a mild ride. It was quite funny though as we sailed through all the rapids they kept falling out everywhere whilst us doing the higher grade rapids and more difficult routes managed to all stay holding on! We were having so much fun as the rapids kept coming, and we faced Walls of water and soon it was time to stop at &apos;lunch island&apos; for a delicious picnic and back onto the boats again!







There was a big stretch of calm before the next rapids where we could jump out and swim, float and be carried along  by the current which was so nice with 27 degree water!







And back in for the next one! A 3m waterfall!! We had to put everything into the paddle after the first part of the rapid to get across the current to get there, but managed!!! Super excited we got down and held on as we plunged over the side and the bottom came rushing up to meet us!!!! Awesome!!!







We had quite a few other long stretches where we entertained ourselves by swimming, singing along and trying not to notice the burning in our triceps!! But the weather clouded over and we started paddling like mad to try and outrun the dark dark clouds, thunder, lightening and rain that had begun!!!!







As team extreme, our guide Tutu had decided that we wanted to be flipped (unbeknown to us it was going to be the next rapid) and as we cruised down towards the next rapid we did our drills, saw the wall of water smashing towards us and then all of the sudden we were in the air!!! The right hand side was practically vertical as we hung on, expecting it to right itself as had happened on other occasions, but Tutu was there straining at the back and before we knew it, we were all tumbling on top of each other, into the water and trapped under the raft. It was particularly scary as I hadn&apos;t expected the capsize and didn&apos;t have a chance to get a big breath. All I knew it was a mass of bodies being swirled around together, someone had landed on me and as the water took them all away I struggled to come up for air and kept hitting the inner tubes of the raft and not finding any airpockets. I was starting to panic being dragged and swirled underneath as I opened my eyes and saw a slow motion bluey green haze as I felt myself drifting and swallowing water and I remember thinking wow, it&apos;s true, at least drowning is peaceful! But I tried to snap myself out of it, get a grip and desperately tried to orientate myself, but instead of getting out of the raft I came up inside another compartment, but there was air!!!! I gasped a huge breath as I saw someone else stuck in the same compartment but back again in panic mode that I was still trapped under the raft and quickly ducked again and tried to push myself out under the raft with my life jacket now trying to keep me up! It is a bit of a blur of swooshing around but all I remember is finally popping up, coughing water, and gasping non stop for air as I struggled to breathe. Mark was holding onto the outside of the raft as we had been instructed to stay with the raft if we could and seeing me quickly dragged me to the boat, checking I was okay and then exclaiming &apos; you were under there a long while!!!&apos; yep, definitely felt it!!!!! Everyone else was accounted for and the raft was flipped, we were consolidated and back in to paddle and swap stories!







It turns out a few people abandoned ship, others were flung clear and the rest of us were trapped under. The boys gave me a few good tips on what to do next time and I felt calm and ready for what was to come!







The last rapid had 3 routes - a grade 3, 4 and 5. A dubious team concensus saw us heading for the grade 5. The grade 5 was called &apos;the bad place&apos; and we were soon to find out exactly why. There was a 100% chance we would flip on the grade 5, and according to our guide, tutu, all going well 15-18 seconds underwater the first time we hit.  And This time it was a big stay AWAY from the boat when, not if it flipped.







We paddle, paddle, paddled as instructed and then &apos;down!!!!&apos; we had what seemed like a vertical drop as a wall of white and brown water came towards us. We hit the main part of the rapid, spun backwards, almost flipped, but D, Al and Mark all just bailed out... ( Well, not that Mark really had a choice being front left and lowest, and therefore under the water!) which re-righted us and got us stuck in &apos;the bad place&apos; as the raft slammed backwards and got sucked forward at speed as we clung on for dear life, petrified that the others had been sucked underneath. When the water cleared I could see no one to the left of me and Owen turned around to face me and see who else had survived we just looked at each other with massive wide eyes filled with fear... um we&apos;re all going to die!!!!!  We spent what felt like ages being buffeted back and forward several metres along this steeply angled suction point and it was hard as we knew we were just waiting for our inevitable fate! Eventually it started to turn and we flipped. It was much different this time. I just watched the water coming gushing at me, waited, took a big breath just before we hit and put my hands up to protect my head and try to feel for the boat. The water swirled and it was like a washing machine as i this time just went with the flow. Who knows what happened to my oar, that was the last thing on my mind as I popped up towards the surface, felt boat and calmly pushed myself down and the boat away, petrified I would be stuck underneath again, but then a few more washing machine cycles and i popped up and out and in the clear! I could see Mark ahead on the right where we had been told to aim for, but no one else as I gathered all my strength and swum across the current to the safety boat and kayak as I was picked up and pulled in!! We survived! And the rest were all okay as everyone was consolidated at the raft for the final paddle to the finish.





The safety boat was a more bouyant and stable raft, rowed from a high centre position with giant wooden oars. Talking to the guys about our last rapid adventure they said they were watching  and laughing like &apos;ah!&apos; As we almost went then, &apos; bam, bam, bam and BOOM!&apos; As we finally capsized,  Apparantly, their purpose... &apos;screw the safety, we are here for the entertainment!!&apos; Well at least we had done well in that regard! :)







We had paddled 31km down the river and there were kebabs and drinks waiting for us as we laughed at the photos and put together what had happened during our &apos;swims!&apos; looking at the photos of us capsizing, people already hidden under the gallons of White water, White knuckles as we gripped the raft rope and arms and legs everywhere it was great. The photos were so awesome we even brought the electronic copies so I will try really hard to post them soon!!!







It was an amazing day and we were all pumped, but already starting to feel the muscle pain and the bruises coming up all over our bodies! We caught the truck back to camp, ran for the hot showers and ate chicken, potatoes and delicious eggplant for dinner before we all hit the bar to celebrate, a &apos;Nile beer&apos; commercial even being shot there! Several people also attempted trying to get into the upside down kayak on the ceiling game, with mixed results!!!







White water rafting at the source of the White Nile. www.adrift.ug   do it!!!!!
 
More Driving and ....Animals!! Jinja, Uganda to Nakuru and then to Naivasha, Kenya

2010-12-01 to 2010-12-02

I think the entire bus was in struggle town this morning as we attempted to pack down our tents, get to breakfast and onto the bus on time after a massive day on the river, being dehydrated and then a night in the bar. I think we left relatively on time as some tents were practically packed down with people still in them.





As usual, another long, long drive day as we vainly tried to sleep, again failing on the crappy boy roads before we hit the Ugandan/Kenyan border and luckily passing through like a breeze.





We were all feeling sore, tired and sorry for ourselves and trying not to knock any of the places we were covered in bruised from!





Finally, about 6 or so we arrived into Kembu Campsite, Kenana Farm, Nioro. ( www.kembu.com) and it was beautiful! Lovely green grass, thatched hut toilets, hot showers, ping pong, dining area, charging points, a bar, a fire!!!! Amazing!!





We dined on mushroom soup, Kenyan style spaghetti bol, seasoned carrots and beans before ping pong and crashing!





Like déjà vu we dragged our sore bodies out of bed, did the usual and hit the road. We firstly stopped in Nakuru Town where we wandered around, got harassed by the touts, and then actually had fun bargaining and buying knick knacks off them.





Very soon we had arrived into Nakuru National Park and quickly closed all the windows as the vervet monkeys tried to join us! The National Park is famous for the thousands of lesser (pink) and greater (White)  flamingoes. We headed towards the Soda Lake so called because of the alkaline water caused by volcanic activity; where we saw flocks of hundreds of pink flamingoes, pelicans, waterbuck, buffalo and various gazelles.





We continued driving and the landscape finally looked to me like the &apos;real Africa&apos; I had in my head! We came across spotted hyenas which I was super excited about as I had been hanging out to see them! And then White Rhinocerous!! There were several of them just wandering around with their giant horns on the noses looking so cool!! The park was established as a sanctuary for black and White rhino.



In Africa, people always talk about seeing the &apos;big 5&apos; which are animals that are the hardest to hunt; And are Elephants, Lions, Buffalo, Rhino&apos;s and Leopards. So far we had seen all but the Leopards in the wild! Pretty lucky!!





We continued on for lunch at a gorgeous viewpoint overlooking the park that was apparantly full of Baboons, but none were home! Driving further we came across scores of them though, along with lots more buffalo, zebra, Impalas, black and white colombus monkeys and lots and lots if birds, some of them super cool and pretty colours!





It was time to leave the park and drive for another three hours to get to Crayfish, our campsite in Naivasha.  It was another quite nice campsite as we settled in, prep&apos;d dinner and then went for a run before gorging on rice, veg and t-bone steaks!







After dinner the boys put on a fireworks show that we are pleased to say no one was injured in after finding it legal to buy fireworks in the supermarket!!!


 
Cycling through Hells Gate National Park, Kenya

2010-12-03

We were ready for our day of action, walking to the front gate and picking up our bikes. Initial impressions were good... Until we got on and attempted to ride, the worlds most uncomfortable seats, bald tyres, no suspension, no gears and dodgy brakes! We soon learnt that when stopping as a group we had to leave a gap through the centre for those that could not use their brakes!



The roads too were so so bumpy and we wondered what we were in for as we began our journey! But within 20 mins we had arrived at Hell&apos;s Gate National Park entrance and were ready for action!





It is a pretty unique experience being able to cycle through a National Park on a game ride, wild animals walking alongside you! We were just metres away from various birdlife, zebras, warthogs, gazelle and then a giraffe! In their natural habitat! It was amazing!





The scenery was also bizarre, beginning with the savannah grasses and massive rock cliffs, before  we then dropped the bikes and descended into the lower gorge, walking down a narrow sandstone ravine, which was quite steep and slippery, but so pretty! We had to cross a few little streams, jump and do a mini rock climb, but it was so gorgeous!





There were also hot Geothermic springs at the bottom! Our ascent saw us with an amazing view over Hell&apos;s Gate Gorge and we did not want to leave!





But it was time to get back on the bikes and ride over the bumpy terrain, rocks, potholes and random soft sand patches, past all the wildlife and back to camp. Such a fun day!





Although we did not get to visit it, Hells Gate National Park is also home of Elsamere, the former home of Joy and George Adamson who did massive amounts for conservation and which the movie &apos;born free&apos; was based on.





It is also weird the all the flora in Africa is so similiar to that of Australia. There are Jacaranda trees, wattle, eucalyptus, bottlebrush just to name a few! Apparantly it is from when all the land masses on Earth used to be joined. Crazy!





We had a free afternoon, chilling out at the pool next to the campsite before it got too cold. Another delicious chicken, pasta and red lentils with vegies dinner before hanging out at the bar, viewing the calender we had all done shots for and then playing games til we hit the local discoteque as it was some peoples last night.







It was literally at the back fence of the campsite and we could hear the music from our tents. The club was a kind of large shed, about 15m by 30m and had soundproofing squares stuck onto all the Walls. Not that it seemed to help much! :) the first thing I noticed when I walked in was the overwhelming smell of BO! Wow! We hit the dance floor and attempted to dance to the local African music, a few locals teaching us the moves, which we soon found out applied to every song, regardless of what it was! There was the bend over and shake your arms down towards the floor and a kind of slow spin in a circle, obevleg forward, a hands in the air and a jumping with hips forward. Yup, all you need! :)
 
Kissed by a Giraffe!! Naivasha to Nairobi, Kenya and then onto Arusha, Tanzania

2010-12-04 to 2010-12-05

Oops, I misjudged the alarm time this morning and D and I ended up nice and early sitting around our cook Duncans fire with hot drinks waiting to begin the day! Very soon we were all packed up and on the road again before the light of the day peeked through.





It was my birthday and D put on a birthday song; and as some of our group were leaving, I received lots of cool pressies they no longer needed that are probably not so exciting anywhere else in the world, but in Africa receiving toilet paper, ryvitas, toiletries, adapters and a head torch are the best presents in the world!





The boys entertained themselves telling me &apos;birthday&apos; stories, the &apos;birthday&apos; time, stories of my (fictional) dead cat and all sorts of random things as I lay down and attempted to sleep. Luckily we did not hit traffic and so got into Nairobi nice and early to drop  people leaving the tour off at the Boulevard hotel, and then out to Acacia Campsite to set up our tents.







I had planned to meet up with Monty and Mick who were in Nairobi at the same time, but with the Internet down  it was tough! Eventually we got hold of their campsite manager who said they had just left to head towards the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage ( www. .......    ) which only had an hour of visiting each day, from 11-12. Danae and Jamie who kindly decided to spend the day with me and I headed out the front gate and onto a local minibus for just 20 shillings(!) (about 25c) to the orphanage. We were gestured to get off and as we alighted, the security guard rushed out to tell the driver to put us back on the bus and take us to the next entrance further up the road. We dubiously alighted at a sign that said something like &apos;workers gate&apos; and asked the guards through the fence. But it randomly turned out to be the right location as he gestured to a part of the gate that opened into a door and told us to walk up the long and seemingly eternal dirt path, and just ask someone for directions.





We walked for about 15 mins, found a cute little warthog family and looked like we were going to turn out in a massive circle when we spied a carpark ahead! Made it!





We entered the David Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage ( www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org )and found right in front if us a pen full of keepers and baby elephants!!! It was so funny as the 7 baby elephants (about a year old) played in the giant muddy pool, played games with each other and entertained us! I had no idea elephants were so human like as toddlers! They fell over, struggled to get up, tripped over, and exhibited so many toddler like behaviours it was crazy! But so cute and so funny to watch!!!





The Orphanage was established by David and Daphne Sheldrick who pioneered techniques of raising orphaned black rhinos and elephants and reintroducing them back into the wild. Most of the babies were found down wells or alone after their parents had been killed by poachers. The zoo staff sleep with the babies and get up through the night to feed them. So cute!





We then squished in and sat on each others knees in the mini van Monty and Micks group had hired, passing the suburb of Karen, named after Karen Blixen, a lady who owned a lot of land in Nairobi and did a lot for conservation. She wrote the famous book &apos;Out of Africa&apos;.







We soon arrived attrue Langata Giraffe Centre. This was definitely my favourite animal place so far!!!!!  It was SO cool!!! We entered, climbed up a viewing platform and were given giraffe food pellets. As we stood there, one if the giraffes came and ate them out of our hands! Giraffes are so beautiful!!! They have such a nice temperament, lovely coats and also such long long eyelashes! :) We got to pat her beautiful soft fur, take photos and even put the pellets into our mouths and she would gently take them from us!!! Giraffe kisses!!!!! They are so delicate and gentle. It was so cool!!! Not at all scary or painful, although there was a fair amount of slobber involved!! SO very very cool! I just wanted to stay there feeding them and patting them forever!





The centre also had an enclosure with mating turtles which proved to be quite comical!





We thought we were to be dropped off at an intersection near Carnivores restaurant where the remainder of our group were, but we ended up at a site over 4km from there. Unpeterbed we tried to catch a dola dola (local minibus), which were for some reason all full, and so walked!







The opposite side of the road was crazy, there was a massive trafficjam, cara were backed up, others driving on crazy angles on the medium strip, getting cargo caught in trees and power cables; and even Cars driving on the wrong side of the road straight at us on our foothpath to avoid the traffic!!!   It was a long way in the hot beating African sun, but we were super glad of a cold drink as we arrived!





Heading home we opted out of the expensive taxis and walked back to the main road to figure out where to catch a dola dola. A friendly couple helped us out as they were going the same way. The traffic was flowing better, but all the vans were full! We waited for ages, the locals telling us &apos;this is Africa! :) eventually a 125 minibus slowed down and we ran with elbows out, all managing to make it on. We drove up the street, along the medium strip, off road, turned down a street across the road, did a complete circle, went down the opposite side of the road in the wrong direction for a bit and then quite a while later, and somewgat unexpectedly arrived just outside our campsite! Sweet!







We went for a walk, checked our the local Internet cafe and supermarket next door and then returned to camp, marvelling at how quickly all your Toenails turn orange from the dust and constantly being dirty and covered in it!





I was very very tempted to go to the net cafe and check my mail, but for some unknown reason decided not to. About half an hour later Mark came around to check on everyone in their tents and we found out that the Internet cafe had just been held up by armed bandits who had stolen the laptops, phones, cameras and valuables from three of our group who were in there. They had burst in, held up the store, forced their way into  the cage that held the stores money, hit Deb, one of our tour with their gun when she had screamed, told her to shut up, then frisked them and stole their valuables. They were all so shaken and had lost their entire photos of their entire trips which was so so sad. And if for whatever reason I weirdly hesitated about going, I would have been there too and lost my wallet, iPod , (which is the only thing i have been able to use for the Internet thus far, and write all my blogs on) camera, all my photos too. Wow.



It was absolutely horrible, but a very good wake up call as I know for sure that I have become much more blasé about Africa since I have been on tour, surrounded by people and having everything organised for me, but just because I have become more comfortable, does not mean that the danger isn&apos;t there. It also makes you realise why every where you turn there is an armed guide- because they are needed. Very good lesson learnt.





I guess it is called Nairobbery for a reason.







After the events of the previous night we were definitely ready to get out of Nairobi! And it was cold!!! Far too cold!!! :) We packed up and although we had preordered breakfast (it wasn&apos;t included that day) the night before and were at the bar at the requested time, it was almost an hour and it still hadn&apos;t arrived and so breakfastless we hit the road!





Arriving into the boulevard hotel we waved goodbye to the final few and picked up our new passengers. Now 25 of us in total! Massive trip! Practically at full truck capacity! After a quick shop stop where we wandered around the supermarket with calculators strategically using every last Kenyan shilling we had left, it was time to experience the best road we have seen so far in Africa!





But alas, before long there were at various places mounds of dirt or rocks on it telling us it was closed and we were detouring sideways back onto the regular super crappy, bumpy, potholed dirt roads. It will be such an easy drive once the bitumen road is finished!!!





After another delicious truck lunch we made our way quickly through the Kenyan border and then hit a roadblock at the Tanzanian side where they individually collected and checked all the passports and then took them away to be rechecked and processed. Luckily they had let me back through on my previous visa, even though I had left the East African union distracting him with the new photographic visa sticker! It was super hot as we waited, but finally we were all through and on the bus to sweat it out and play an assortment of games to pass the time before we drove through Arusha and out to our campsite, Snake Camp about 30km outside the town.







As we were driving along we saw a truck on it&apos;s side on the left hand side of the road and a massive pile of goats  lying on the right, legs in the air... 27 of them we counted! The truck was totally smashed at the front, including the drivers window. Pretty bad!





I had got lucky with the duties again, as even though my new duty group were on food prep, we had a campsite meal at our Snake Park campsite. Unfortunately it wasn&apos;t as good as our cook Duncan&apos;s food though!
 
Arusha to the stunning Serengeti, Ngorongoro crater, the big 5 and back!!! Tanzania

2010-12-06 to 2010-12-08

After a treat of a sleep in, we breakfasted at 0730, I looked over the back fence from our tent and saw a crocodile just a few metres away!! Hilarious! And that&apos;s why the campsite is called Snake Park- it has a reptile park on it&apos;s premises!





We jumped into the truck to check out Arusha. On the way back we checked out the Cultural Centre which gave us the coolest &apos;presentation&apos; on tanzanite. Tanzanite is a very rare store that is mined 40km from Arusha - the only place in the world you can find it! And SO beautiful! It is all varying shades of blue and blue violet as they called it, and amazing! But SO expensive. We saw a stone worth a million dollars, and I picked out a little heart shaped stone I really liked, they weighed it and told me $2500! um, not today thanks!!! They are the most beautiful stones I have ever seen for sure though.





Back at our Snake Park campsite, we packed down our tents, packed an overnight bag for the Serengeti and walked to the reptile park on the premises. And it was cool! It had heaps and heaps of dangerous snakes, and ones that really looked like they would kill you!!! the black mamba, adders, pythons, constrictors, you name it! It even had a scary looking rhinocerous snake I would not like to come across in a camouflaged ground!





There were big crocodiles fighting, baby crocs, tortisrs, birds and all sorts of things. Very cool for a free park! But it was soon time to head back to start our Serengeti excursion! We were saying goodbye to the truck and our crew for a few days as we headed out on Safari to the Serengeti and Ngorogoro crater in small 4 wheel drives that were definitely a luxury to travel in after our big truck! Www.bobbycamping.com





The roads too were amazing! Tarred, painted and sealed! After seeing a tyre change for one of our convoy, a 45 year old termite mound several metres high, and a Masai village complete with just one warrier, his 14 wives and 120 children (!!!) we hit our stop, a souvenir shop of course! Ridiculously overpriced, but with some cool carvings and Masai things.





We then passed through Mosquito River town, which surprisingly enough has a big malaria problem! Before we arrived in Karatu, set up our tents, did some pilates with D, had semi warm showers and so much free time with having no chores! As we were on an outsourced Safari to the Serengeti, the company was doing it all! Yay!





Dinner was a lovely affair at a table with lights! And soup, rice, beef stew, butter... With cabbage :) and pineapple custard for dessert!





A local dance and acrobat troop then arrived and performed some traditional music and dances. The first was apparantly about malaria, and the remainder just lookedcluke bizarre mating rituals! Some acrobats then came in and performed some amazing flips, contortion work and ate pieces of fire which was crazy to watch. They then pulled us up for a dance before handing around the hat and of course hounding us to buy their wares! They had things that were cheaper than other places we had been and so managed to get some little pressure before we all hit the sack. Another early start in the morning!





Up just after 4am we were up and at em, packing up our tent, eating and into the cars whilst it was still dark to get to the entrance of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area when it opened.







Ngorogoro Conservation Area was Formed by rifts and volcanoes and is 8300 square km and together with the Serengeti  is the wet season pasture for 2 million migatory animals!





The volcano of Ngorongoro that formed the crater erupted 3 thousand million years ago! It is also world heritage listed.





The reason it is so renouned is that Animals prefer to stay on the crater floor because of the plentiful food and water. At a height of 2200m and dropping to 610m, almost 20km at it&apos;s widest point it is the 8th largest crater in the world. It also had a large lake, lake makat, or Magadi which inventively means &apos;alkaline&apos; in Swahi/Masaai!!





We passed through a rainforest type terrain where apparantly there was a leopard sitting just a metre from the side of the road! We saw a few buffalo and then stopped at the crater rim for a photo op, which was cool, but too hazy to really fully appreciate it; before descending to the crater floor.







Unfortunately the weather was gloomy, overcast and freezing as we popped up the top of the Safari vehicle to get the best view. We saw Thompsons and Grants Gazelles, buffalo, wilderbeast, zebra, elephants, a (apparantly!) black rhino so far on the horizon that we craned through the binoculars, (these are highly endangered)  jackals, heartebeast,  lions!! Including big male lions and cubs, Reedbuck, mice, vevet monkeys, hatrebeast, black backed jackal, and the bat eared fox from a distance.





And then the highlights! - hyenas right next to the car and crossing the road in front of us!

- a giant 55 year old elephant coming right at us and again crossing the road in front of us!

- hyenas and vultures feasting on a buffalo carcass,

- a Gazelle giving birth,

- lion cubs!

- lions feasting on a carcass

- something scaring the flamingoes and the entire lake moving abd flying up in a pink cloud!!





And a trillion birds, hawks, storks, vultures, the Ugandan Crane, buzzards, bustards, pelican, beautiful pink and White flamingoes, hundreds of small brightly coloured birds.







Our packed Lunch .... Um a sprinkling of Grated carrot on a sandwich! ... Or as we called it, essence of carrot! and a little lunch pack we had at a hippo lake before we headed out if the crater up to the Serengeti, or Sirengit in Swahili, meaning endless plain. And it is!  14763km endless plain that was caused by the volcanic ash from the Ngorogoro volcanoes.







They also spray all cars entering the National Park and have blue sticky flags up to attract the Setse Flies that give you &apos;sleeping sickness&apos; or yellow fever are attracted to both blue and &apos;mzungu blood&apos;!







We spent the afternoon driving through the southern and central areas and Luckily the weather was finally startingto clear as we drove past the actual rock that was the inspiration for &apos; Pride Rock &apos; in The Lion King, saw a massive herd of about 18 elephants on the horizon, Saw thousands and thousands of Zebra and Wildebeast that had just completed the annual migration from the Masai Mara in Kenya in the North, as far as the eye could see. It was amazing!





We saw a brand new tiny tiny baby Thompsons Gazelle that got so scared as we drove past it ran in mini circles and then just hit the ground, and was so well camuflagued you couldn&apos;t even tell it was there!





We also saw quite a few baby zebra that were SO cute! Not newborns, but still covered in their brown fuzz and all scared and wobbly hiding behind their mothers!





We had two jackal run up the road towards us and boy they look sneaky with their little eyes!







And then..... We heard on the radio there was a leopard spotting! We held on as we raced to the location and found about 6 other land cruisers already there. We drove in and all of the sudden saw a mother leopard run across this large dead tree on the ground and sit in the branches, swinging its tail. We were amazed as suddenly a super cute little baby leopard followed her!!! It was amazing a we sat there watching them! So very cool! And that was our leopard spotting! We had seen all the ! Big 5&apos; game animals as I talked about previously!! Woohoo!!!





We drove on, happy the weather had cleared and improved our game views when we saw a movement in front of us and realised there was a whole pride of lions, including the male, and little cubs sitting in the long grass!! Amazing! We watched the baby suckle his mothers milk and then the lioness walk to the male lion, as they rubbed each others faces. Ah, so sweet!!!





We also saw so many Warthogs happily trotting around swinging their tails high. Apparantly  their memories are so bad they will start going somewhere or doing something and within 3 minutes would forget what it is they were doing!!







And then a topi, and Impala - known as &apos;fast food&apos; as they are literally fast, food for their predators and ironically have a giant &apos;M&apos; on their butts that we quickly linked back to McDonalds! :)





As we drove towards our campsite a Bustard almost hit the car and came in through the open top too!





The Sunset was amazing, lighting the sky with bright pinks and reds around the totally clear ball of fire as it set. Unfortunately photos did not represent it, but it was awesome.





We made our way to out camp for the night... Well, our patch of grass as we were Bush camping! We were staying at Timbili ( meaning black faced vervet monkey in Swahili) right in the centre of the National Park in Seronera as we ate a soup and spaghetti bol and headed to bed to listen to the noises of the wild. We were told to take a buddy if we had to walk anywhere during the night!





Another black pack down and start to the day to begin our game drive as the sum came up. Apparantly the first car out of the campsite had seen a pride of lions just next to it!





Unfortunately the day again dawned cold and overcast as we rugged up in all our layers wondering what on earth was going on. Africa is supposed to be hot!!!





Our first viewing was a Line of wildebeast on migration... There was one leader and one strong at the rear and the rest in between. Quite cool! But they are Possibly one of the ugliest and most awkward animals I have ever seen!Again we saw thousands and thousands of Wildebeast and Zebras. Apparantly there are about 1.5 million wildebeast and over 300 000 thompsons gazelle and zebra.







We then came across an Elephant family. We had 2 males near us, one of which came up to a tree near our car and started rubbing it&apos;s head against it. It then came up to the tree less than 2 metres away and tried to knock it down!! It then ate for a bit before raising his trunk, getting scared by a camera flash and moved away. The rest of the family, 2 young elephants and the female then joined them, the adult elephants kissing while the young ones posed under them. It was amazing! And right in front of one of our trucks!!!





We also saw Rock hyrax, dik dik, and a massove aardvark hole :). As well as the big 5, there are also the small 5, all having characteristics similiar to one of the Big 5, and we saw most of them too! These are:

Rock Hyrax (elephant)

Leopard Tortoise (Leopard)

Rhino dung beetle (rhino)

White crowned buffalo weaver bird (buffalo)

Lion Porcupine (lion)







And just as we were beginning our drive out something dashed across the road in front of the car in front of us! Cheetah! It paused to the right of us and walked around, the tip of it&apos;s White tail bopping around as it moved!! So cool!!





As we drove home between the parks we saw two Masai boys all dressed up in their bright Masai blankets, with bright White painted faces. Apparantly this is part of their coming of age circumscision and heading into the bush ceremony.







We then passed an entire family of Giraffes by the side of the road, with all varying ages which looked awesome. We then passed an elephant walking down the road, a baboon walking on his two hind legs!!! And an entire herd of elephants crossing the bitumen highway!!! Crazy!







We passed the famous trees of the area, the bao bao, or upside down tree as it is more commonly known, the legend saying it wanted to be the biggest and best tree in Africa, and sucked up all the water meant for the surrounding plant life also. When God heard he became angry and picked up the tree and replanted it upside down to teach it a lesson! Apparantly without leaves it looks much more upside down, with it&apos;s branches splaying out like roots.





We also brought a bunch of Red bananas which are only grown in the Mosquito River Region, but no one could tell us how or why! They are  only ed on the outside though! A bit thicker than regular bananas, and a slightly different taste and consistency, more similiar to dried bananas and delicious!





Finally after a few leakages from the rain we made it back to out campsite, set up tents, did a quick circuit, finally showered and randomly ran into my mates Mick and Monty again! I was so glad to get a truck meal again from our cook Duncan as we had not really had any fruit or veg the entire safari as we dined on rice, beef and bean stew and the most delicious eggplant and carrot. After finally having my dues having to do pot wash and also put down the soaking wet cooktent with a reduced team of 3 it was time to hit the bar for catch ups!




 
The most epic truck day, but finally to paradise! Arusha, Dar Es Salaam, Stone town and Kendwa, the

2010-12-09 to 2010-12-13

Alarms at 3 something in the morning are definitely not our favourite as we are beginning to become adept at our morning routine in the dark. Some more adept than others as we heard about all nighter antics at the bar the night before! Breakfasting at 4, packing lunch and on the road before 5, we all crashed out, stirring as the light dawned and we drove past Moshi where we could see the snow on Mt kilimanjaro!







We passed Sisal plantations with the bright red trees that made the local spirit konyagi. The drive was quite beautiful surrounded by the Usambara and Pare mountain regions, and past pangani where we were going to stay the night before deciding instead to have a marathon drive and push straight through to our next destination at Dar Es Salaam.







Along the way we saw so many trucks, buses, minibuses and cars that were on their sides on the side of the road, or had been dragged to police stations or repair yards along the way. It was pretty bad, most of them having rolled and were all crushed with windows totally smashed in, and looking like there was no way anyone could have survived. And apparantly they didn&apos;t as our driver Alois told me later. In fact the truck and goat crash that was just outside our campsite a few days earlier had killed three people. Pretty scary. Although it took a ridiculously long time, It made us really glad to be on our truck taking it safely as the local vehicles sped fast us erratically on the dodgy potholed dirt roads practically inviting accidents to happen.







Travelling past palm trees we neared the Indian ocean! We were close! We had a short stop in the city of Dar Es Salaam, but it turned out to be independance day and nothing was open. We jumped back on the truck and attempted to get to the ferry to take us over to Kigomboni; where our campsite was. The first road was closed and we joined a massive queue of traffic trying to merge to get there. We passed a local fish Market and pretty much sat still for the next hour and a half, moving at a snails pace forward. The road was shin deep in water which we thought was from the fish Market and sea, but apparantly was also grey water and sewerage. A car in front of us broke down and we watched in horror as the driver had to get down on his back and slide underneath the vehicle, only his face and knees above the water. Gross!!!







Finally, after an hour and a half of queueing we were at the front and were on the ferry for the literally 5 minute journey to the other side. We had just another 20 mins to get to our campsite, but looking out the windows at the bustling markets, non stop food stalls, no one hassling or trying to sell us anything and the awesome chilled out beach atmosphere; without even leaving the truck it was already our favourite African city!







It was a Long long long long long! day and so hot. Sitting in the bus it was enough to drive us insane as we just sat there sweating and not moving. And so humid! So nasty! By the time we pulled into Kipepepeo camp, our campsite we were so hot, so tired, and so over being on the truck! It was almost 8 by the time we got in; almost 15 hours after we had left Arusha. We were like zombies as we set up our tents, did our allocated chores, had a quick spag bol and veg for dinner, cold showers and struggled to even talk! Luckily we had Internet to catch up on the world before we collapsed shattered! ... For just a few hours before the rains came in! I heard about 4 drops and bolted up, vainly trying to close the tent flaps that were attempting to get us some air. And then the buckets started! It absolutely poured from just after 4am for about an hour as I waited for it to start leaking. In the end we had one massive puddle... That my bag inconveniently soaked up. Lucky my camera is waterproof!! :)







By the time the rain had stopped, our super noisy camping neighbours had packed up and left and it was already time to get up!! Our company had a not so amazing system of equipment management as we sorrily packed down our soaking wet tents to fester under the truck and go mouldy for the next four days in our absence, as even though our crew were staying behind, we were not allowed to leave them up to dry out!







We were dropped off at the ferry port to take the ferry as foot passengers to the mainland and elbows out we clamboured on, got seats and 3 mins later we standing to walk off again. Maybe the government should invest in a bridge!!! :)







We had a few minutes to get supplies, and attempt to change my Rwandan and Ethiopian money..... which still no one wants!!!! And then onto the Kilimanjaro ferry for the couple of hours out to the island of Zanzibar.





Zanzibar was one of the major starting points for most east African explorers in their quests for new lands which is quite cool. It is also only 6&apos; south of the equator so always so warm! :)





We actually had a really nice ferry with aircon and tv&apos;s showing the movie &apos;a perfect storm&apos;... The perfect movie to watch whilst at sea! :) and within 5 minutes I was passed out asleep, but apparently all they got was the first 20 mins and it restarted again all voyage!







We had to take our passports, fill out an arrival card and get them stamped, even though we were still in Tanzania, which I thought was kind of weird, nevertheless it was quite an easy process with our local guide and we were soon boarding a bus to take us another 3 minutes down to road to Karibu Inn, our hostel in Stone Town.







The capital, Stone Town, is said to be the only functioning ancient town in east africa. The streets still retain their Indian and Arabic influence, from the shops, to old houses, to the palace of the Sultans, a beautiful location right on the water, from when the Sultan of Oman relocated here from the Persian Gulf in the 1840s, and founded their vast empires on the spoils of the slave and ivory trade.







Although it was still stifiling hot, Luckily with the ocean breeze it was nowhere near as hot or as humid as it was in Dar so we felt quite relieved to have escaped.







We excitedly checked in to our first beds and first non tent accomodation and facilities in almost a month, ate lunch and were off to explore. The windy streets were full of little shops and beautiful old buildings in varying states of disrepair. As we walked a local tried to be our guide, walking along pointing out blatently obvious things to us like &apos;this is a shop. You can buy things here.&apos; &apos;this is a cat.&apos; &apos;this is a church. It is big.&apos; Until we managed to lose him doubling back in the streets!







We arrived at the site of the Old Slave Market, now an Anglican Cathedral from 1870s, from which nothing remains except a few underground holding cells. The high Altar of the church marks the location of the world whipping post.





It was previously the worlds last open slave market where slaves from east and central Africa were brought and sold. Dr David Livingstone (of the source of the Nile and Vic Falls fame) appealed to scholars of Oxford and Cambridge to liberate Africa from slavery and it was stopped by decree by the Sultan of Zanzibar in 1873.







We continued wandering the windy old streets, enjoying the beautiful, but run down grand houses. The Island used to be famous for its spices and as we wandered down to the local markets there were all different types of spices you could buy. There is also a spice tour you can do which takes you around to all the spice plantations that is apparently really good.







The markets also had all kinds of tropical fruits, red bananas and really massive bananas, almost 30cm long! And then inside a &apos;fresh&apos; seafood Market with tables of seafood sitting there in the sun and covered in flies. Not so nice!







We then came across more local markets selling all matter of things, but mainly stores with t shirts and shoes before it got really repeative and we started home.







I had no idea, but the singer Freddie Mercury was born on Zanzibar and there was a tribute restaurant to him there on the water which was quite nice.







We met the rest of the group at a bar called Livingstones which was right on the beach and the chairs in the sand. So nice! It was delightful sitting on the edge of the water enjoying cocktails in the tropical paradise as we watched the beautiful colours of the sun set across the sky and the locals doing acrobatic flips and jumps down the sand into the water.







As seafood lovers, we were all excited to be going to the Forodhani Gardens seafront Market on the waterfront. But alas it did disappoint. As we arrived we thought the local bustling atmosphere of all the stores set up was exciting, but we soon realised that there was nothing more painful than trying to look at the goods, be harassed by touts and attempt to bargain a price for a seafood skewer. Definitely far too much hassle for a meal! It wasn&apos;t even that cheap as we worked our bargaining action on a fish skewer each to start. And they were the driest, saltiest, chewiest and grossiest fish we had ever eaten! In fact we had to throw them out!







We tried again at a different stall on some prawns and octopus and quickly yelled at them to stop as they tried to add more salt, and these were better, but not amazing. We decided that they cook them, then just reheat them when we buy them... And probably reuse them each night!







Most people that had the Zanzibar pizza were impressed with them though- kind of crepes they cooked right in front of you, then added toppings such as cheese and tomato, or nutella and banana, and then folded all the edges in to seal it all in.







The area is apparantly an alcohol free zone, but as usual people will come up and ask if you want something and then they will get it for you. James decided to buy some beers, and bargained him down, but instead of giving him half the money, and the rest on his return, he gave everything to him, and extra money for the guy to buy cigarettes for him as well. Needless to say, after 20 mins we decided that guy was not coming back! :) Even funnier, James was so laid back that he hadn&apos;t bothered to chase up his change from the guy who had delivered his Zanzibar pizza, and once again that guy was nowhere to be seen! Expensive night! :)







We were glad to escape the constant attention as we headed to a bar, but finding it little more than a few old rooms with a wall knocked out to get to an outside area, no music, atmosphere, people or many drink selections, I decided to call it a night.







After a sleep in, a crappy hostel breakfast, supplimented by delicious cheap fresh tropical fruits, I bargained a few shawls down and then headed with Owen to  a restaurant overlooking the water with a postcard perfect view to relax our remaining time with delicious fruit, muesli and yoghurt before we were going to be transferred to our accomodation at Kendwa, on the Northern beaches for a few days on the beach!







The ride was much quicker than we expected, less than an hour as we suddenly turned along a really potholed dodgy dirt road with tiny little local shopfronts. At the end of this street was the road entrance to our accomodation, Sunset Bungalows.







We were directed to our room, a triple right down on the beach with 3 massive queen size beds with fresh sheets, mosquito netting, a big bathroom, fridge, fan and air conditioning! It was pure luxury!!! And really good value!!





We headed straight out to check out the beach bar, hammocks, couches, restaurant, beach volleyball court, thatched shade umbrellas with sunbeds and the beautiful White sand and crystal clear water! Amazing!







The sun was scorching hot though as we hid out in the shade and waited for it to lessen slightly, but it was still super warm as we spent the afternoon chilling out before beginning a game of beach volleyball.  Before we knew it, we had Germans, locals, two Israeli guys and a whole international game! It was awesome as we played for hours, stopping only to appreciate the gorgeous red sunset over the water until we could no longer see the ball properly and jumped in the water to de-sand and enjoy an amazing twilight swim.







Our tour leader Amy had written up the cocktail board and there were all drinks named after our group -  &apos;juicy James&apos;, &apos;Naughty Nat&apos;, &apos;Delicious Debbie&apos; and &apos;Orgasmic Owen&apos;, so it looked like we were ready for the massive beach party that was happening next door at Kendwa Rocks later that night.







We had a group dinner organised that night at the beach restaurant and we had a table set up right on the sand, it was awesome! Although we had pre-ordered our meals by writing earlier in the day to make life easy for them, the amazing African customer service we were becomming acustomed to shone as they managed to mix up the meals, not have some, and not even care. We finally all ate, had a cake for Emmas birthday, watched some traditional dancers perform and then retired to our beach verandah to relax with a few cheap drinks before the party.





The local spirit, Konyagi, conveniently comes in these little sachets so you can open one, pour it into your drink, and then stuff them in your purse or pocket so you only have to pay for mixers at the bar. So convenient! We definitely made the most of them this trip!







We walked down the beach to Kendwa Rocks, the hotel next door where a massive beach party was taking place with people everywhere and music pumping out of their thatched roof beach bar. We met up with some friends from Volleyball and other people from our tour as we danced the night away, trying to escape from the local &apos;beach boys&apos; and traditionally Masai &apos;warriers&apos; there to find a western girl!







Unfortunately Ellies purse was stolen from her handbag, but luckily the only thing she had in it was money for the evening.







We met a few Adelaide guys, Alex and Sam, who we were to catch up with most days during our time on the island, and also a German girl Anica, who was just joining the tour.







The next day was a treat of swimming, relaxing, walking to see the local shops (... Where out of all of Africa, i find frozen yoghurt in a tiny local store!) and markets and of course hours on the volleyball court with all our new friends.







Walking up the beach trying to find Internet, I came across a hotel called Eden and went in to ask. She originally spoke Italian, before switching to English and  I was given the price in Euros, which I thought weird, but continued on nonetheless. I had just opened a page when security came up, speaking Italian and broken English and asked me to leave. I was a little confused, but after questioning he said I had to leave as I was not Italian! What the?! As in my head I was thinking, &apos;hang on, I&apos;m sure there are laws about this back home!!! He escorted me off the premises and I continued down the beach, with no further luck. Walking back, the quikest way back to the main road seemed to becat the side of the Eden village and I began to walk towards the path when a man ran towards me and blocked me off, telling me in broken English I was not allowed to be there and escorted me away. I couldn&apos;t believe it! Turns out it is some kind of posh Italian Resort who cater only for Italians and are not at all tolerant! Lovely!





Spending the rest of the day again relaxing before a few hours of volleyball, amazing sunset and twilight swim; the two Israeli guys we had been playing volleyball with were leaving the next day and so we headed up the road to The Local Fishermans Restaurant where we had a cheap and tasty feast of delicious fresh seafood.







We finished the night chatting at Kendwa Rocks Bar, with James leaving our room key somewhere and having to hunt in the closed, dark bar for it to get back into our room! Boys!







The next morning, Monday, we were excited to be heading out on a full day snorkelling trip to Mnembo island. Bright and early we boarded the local dhow (traditional wooden fishing boat) that was to take us the 14km to the island. Luckily we went the right direction and totally missed the massive heavy black rain clouds that dumped on the beach after we left! It was cool travelling along the coast and checking out the island as we made our way to Nungwi beach to pick up some of the guys who were staying there. Although they seemed to have a few more beachside restaurants to eat it, whereas ours were on the road, their beach was not as nice, with small pockets of sand as opposed to our massive long continuing beach, and then at low tide had a massive walk out so they could swim; the hotels were more independant and segregated, no free moving, no volleyball courts, beach umbrellas or socialness which we all enjoyed at Kendwa beach and we were again so glad we had made the blind decision to stay there!







We got our equipment and then stopped further up the beach to collect fizzy drinks, eskies of food and a delicious large fresh tuna that was to be our lunch. Another stop to collect some more passengers, then to drop lunch off to be cooked for us and we were finally just off the island and ready to snorkel! We excitedly jumped into the sparkling clear blue water and swam towards the coral reef. Alas to say I must have been pretty lucky to snorkel where I have in Australia, East Timor, Indonesia and the Red Sea in Egypt because this was really disappointing! Although it was nice to swim so close to zebra fish who had no fear and practically swam straight into your facemask, the limited amount of coral was mostly brown and dull and although there were pretty tropical fish, there were not hundreds of them as I was used to. Nevertheless once I got over my initial disappoint, kept swapping masks until I found one that worked and then swum around constantly to try and chase the fish, I saw a super cool sole fluttering along the bottom, just looking exactly like the sand until he moved, some pretty electric blue fish, that black, White and yellow fish that is in the fish tank in &apos;Finding Nemo&apos;, lots of long skinny fish that just kind of sat there in the water and quite a few other ones. We were only allowed an hour to snorkel and we thought we would have some more time after lunch, but no! Our full day of snorkelling involved just one hour snorkelling! Luckily we had a good group and amused ourselves jumping off the roof of the dhow and then eating an absolutely delicious BBQed tuna marinaded with Ginger, salad, rice, chipati and fresh fruit.







It was then time to head home. Although the drive there had taken us about an hour and a half, the way back with the tide out and extremely shallow water had us navigating in crazy zigzag patterns to not hit any rocks as we occasionally bounced over sand bars and had to have the crew jump out and push us over others as we became lodged.







Combined with the operaters turning us into a  Watertaxi service with the amount of stops and pickups we made on the way back, it was about 3 hours and we were well over it and well over being burnt to a crisp in the endless beating sun.







As we finally neared our hotel we saw some commotion about 15m out to see and suddenly saw a pod of dolphins jumping through the water! So cool! We jumped off, glad to have escaped the constant bearing, burning sunshine and never ending boat ride to find James had misplaced the room key again! Searching everywhere we ended up with a spare from reception, but later speaking to Debbie found it after James had given it to her for safe keeping and then both forgot about it!







Hiding from the sun as best as we could, we sat back to chillax with the gang and watch the red colours of another beautiful sunset fill the sky. Whilst half the group lay on the beach bar couches unable to move from a day in the sun, the rest of us walked up to The Local Fisherman&apos;s Restaurant ( or the &apos;House of delicious&apos; as our waiter called it!) and enjoyed some nice cheap, fresh seafood dishes. I had the stuffed de-boned fish.... Amazing! Meeting the rest of the gang at the Kendwa Rocks bar we chatted for a bit, before finding the campfire on the beach and some Adelaidean friends Sam and Alex we had met a few days earlier and enjoyed our last night in paradise before walling the 5 mins home along the beach! Ah, I am going to miss this place!!!






 
Farewell Paradise! Hello truck :) Zanzibar, Dar Es Salaam, Iringa, Tanzania, then Chitimba, Malawi!

2010-12-14 to 2010-12-16

We were sorry to say goodbye to our tropical paradise as we packed up

and checked out. We had the randomest mix in our group, from a 16 year

old to a 74 year old (2 x mother/son/daughter combinations), a female

couple from Alaska and people from Thailand, Japan, Aus, Nz, UK,

Canada, Spain, but again we were saying goodbyes as we lost more

people as their trip segments completed.







We squashed onto the minibus for the hour or so back from our base at

Kendwa on the Northern Beaches to Stone Town. After a quick attempt to

find lunch... Not so easy with limited time and at half past 10 in the

morning, we were into a bus... For 2 minutes this time! Back to the

ferry port to get the elbows out and get a seat before the masses got

them all! It was again delightful with padded seats, air conditioning

and some tv&apos;s up the front, even if all they were showing was a

constant repeat of ice age documentaries pitting real animals against

bad animation of extinct stone age ones!







The ferry was quite bumpy... Story of our lives! :) and I made the

mistake of heading out onto the back deck to use the bathroom. Note to

self - this is where the seasick flock to vomit!







Eventually the hour and a half to two hour ferry ride was over and we

joined the crush of people exiting, some carrying full size fridges on

their heads, up the stairs and all!







Another bus to the ferry, another crush to jam on, 5 minutes later

walk up the hill and wait for our truck back to the campsite. And....

No more luxury as we set up our tents back at Kipepepeo camp. Amazing

to be back right on the beach again, not so amazing trudging through

the sand and putting it all through the tent!







It was again so stifiling hot and humid as we downed water, waiting

for the sun to set, give us some respite and then let us enjoy a

pilates session on the sand by Emma. A quick shower, goat, plantane

(cooking bananas) and veg for dinner and it was into the bar and

Internet to catch up on the world before we said goodbye to James and

attempted to sleep in the stifiling hot.





After feeling like no sleep at all after a restless night, the alarm

went off at 3 something, we packed, breakfasted at 4 and were again on

the road before 5.





It was a nice uneventful first few hours as we attempted to sleep

through to daylight, but soon found the road to be blocked and had to

detour... And then arrive at a grinding halt as we heard stories of a

4 car pile up ahead and saw a massive massive queue of cars as far as

the eye could see. After sitting for about half an hour in the

stifiling heat cars started coming through the fields around us

offroad. Eventually metre by metre we progressed to find nothing but

rows of cars, trucks and buses! There was one truck stuck in the mud

but it more looked like he was attempting to offroad than he had

caused it. And eventually we came out the other side and it was free

flowing! Nothing causing it! Weird!





By now we had all found the massive stash of book swap crates in the

back of the truck and enjoyed chilling out and reading most of the day.





The highway went through Mikumi National Park, but as it was a highway

we were not allowed to stop and so just watched the zebras, giraffes

and gazelles as we passed.





We stopped constantly throughout the day for periods of anout half an

hour for more and more road works, that combined with the heat, us

burning through the windows or in a milisecond if we stepped outside

and the truck heating up like a sauna, we thought we would never arrive!





At least we had something to look at though as we had massive scenery

changes throughout the day. Starting with the beach this morning, we

went through the city of Dar Es Salaam, through the endless expanse of

the savannah, through red dirt rocks, and then to vegetation; lots of

trees in the Baobaob valley and then hills covered in small trees

before we came to mountains covered in trees and rocks and then a

cross between all! I guess we did cover a lot of distance - in African

terms. It was after 1830 when we arrived, we had driven over 13 and a

half hours.... And covered about 600km. :)



The Old Farm House, Kisolanza Farm, Iringa (www.kisolanza.com ) was

our campsite, and although it was after dusk we could still tell how

cute the setting was. The toilets were individual little thatched roof

houses with super clean, new drop toilets and plenty of toilet paper.

It was at altitude and quite chilly which we were definitely glad

about!! The showers were A-mazing! Big stalls, a place to hang your

towel, and clothes! Drains that worked, a floor that wasn&apos;t dirt, a

light .... And .... Hot water! It&apos;s the small things now that impress

us! Boy was it luxury! Possibly THE best shower I have ever had!

Steaming hot water, so much so I had to turn the cold water on. I

think that is the first time that has happened ever in Africa!! :) I

didn&apos;t want to get out! But eventually it was time to see the cute

little bar with traditional little woven seats and couches around the

edge, and apparantly the best brownies and Amarula hot chocolates!



We had rice, chicken and eggplant and beans for dinner before we

collapsed for the evening.





We got a sleep in the next morning, not having to get up tip 5

something! Luxury! On the road and it didn&apos;t take long for the heat to

kick back in again! We read, played cards and sweltered before we

lunched watched by a lot if local kids by a mango tree and amused

ourselves obtaining the unripe fruit to ripen in the sauna that is the

truck! At first it was just jumping, but by the end of lunch it was

George out the truck windows with the cricket bat!





We spent time swapping our excess Tanzanian shillings or US dollars to

Malawaian Kwacha with a local named Freddie, all sounding quite dodgy

but we got a good rate! :)







And we then arrived at my favourite border so far. Our Tour Leader Amy

could process in one hit our exit from Tanzania and we then drove

through and jumped off to enter Malawi. Not a single tout to be seen!

No one harassing us at all! Amazing!! The immigration officer looked

at me dubiously and asked &apos;this is you?&apos; after seeing my passport

photo. I proclaimed it was and he replied &apos;show me&apos;. I took off my hat

as he never even bothered to look ip again and check! Dodgy! And

grumpy! Nevertheless after just a few regular questions we were all

through, back on the sweltering bus and had another rendition of &apos;the

game&apos; where we all write celebrities names and then have different

rounds such as charades in teams to pick them. As usual our combined

dubious assessment of who was &apos;world famous&apos; caused a great deal of

laughter. No one letting us forget ourvprevious entrants of George

Mallory, Enid blyton and Beatrix Potter. The boys equally as bad with

crickter Kevin Peiterson and basketballer Kobie Bryant.





The time passed quickly as we arrived at Chitimba Camp, set up camp,

completed chores, found a local woman who volunteered her services to

be paid to do our washing and then had time for a run before dinner!

Just 500km and less than 11 hours today! Yay!





Our campsite was cool, right on the sand at the edge of Lake Malawi!

It was absolutely stifiling hot, and with cold lake water showers!





We had beetroot mash with pork mince for dinner before heading to the

bar to play some games before bed. Two nights in the one spot! So

excited!!



day 24- 25-26
 
The future revealed. The Witch doctor, Chitimba, Malawi

2010-12-17

It was so ridiculously hot and humid and the sun already up with us

gaining an hour that our tents had all turned into saunas and we were

all up and wandering around before 6am. We attempted to keep cool as

we waited around for breakfast.







And although we are in a tropical paradise, the included fruit we get

are bananas. And they are the only fruit you can ever seem to buy on

the street that don&apos;t involve a knife and a plate. By the time we have

had these several times a day, every day, I almost want to vomit when

I see them now!







Aaaaaaaand were then off to the local village to see the witch doctor!







The sun was so burning hot we were all using umbrellas to try and

protect us as we walked with our guides Wisdom and Alex about 15 mins

to the local village. We were welcommed in as we sat on a straw mat

and waited for the witch doctor. As we went into his mudbrick house

and sat at one edge of the small room, he was sitting opposite us,

about 2 m away in a green dress with a red cross embroidered on the

front. He had colourful beads around his neck with a bone on one set,

a whistle in another and the final strands going up to a a round patch

near his right ear which we were later explained was magic and where

he gets his visions from. The necklaces are also something that only

witchdoctors wear.







Apparantly the Witchdoctor went into the wild for an extended period

to learn how to become a witch doctor before coming back to the village.







There were 3 other locals in the corner of the room and they started

playing the drums as the witchdoctor continued to make that odd

&apos;whoomp&apos; sound with the air from his mouth, moved his head from where

it was leaning on the wall with his eyes closed, and we saw for the

first time his crazy looking drugged eyes, although later when asking

we were assured that he was not on anything.



He then stood and began to dance by hitting his feet on the floor and

shake his body that had several think bands of noise making shakers

that were like bits of tin tied on that made sounds as they hot each

other. He began to shakecso enthusastically that bits of tin started

to fall off. One fell on me so I kept it as a souvenir. You only get a

curse if you believe it! :)







He had a Whistle around his neck that he kept blowing, apparantly this

is not traditional, but just something he likes to do to add to his

performance. He got all of us up to dance with him where we got to see

close up those crazy drugged eyes, and then it was over, just about 5

mins or so! We all felt like it was very &apos;touritised,&apos; but were going

to return back in individually for ourcreadings anyway!







He was sitting on his chair ascwe sat opposite with a translater next

to us and Kept doing that gushing air from his mouth in a whomp sound

that apparantly all witch doctors do.







And so..... My &apos;reading....!&apos; :) ( for those that are aware of my

misadventures in Africa I am sure will find the first as amusing as i

did! :) )







My travels have been safe so far and will continue to be so.

(ummm..!:) )







My family is all safe and I will have a good long life with good health







I have a Boyfriend... (Um, Nope!)







Oh, dont worry, I will have one soon. (um thanks, but I&apos;m not worried!)







When I get married I will have a long happy marriage with no divorce.







I will have 2 children, 1 boy, 1 girl, and my brother and sister will

both have 3 kids, 2 girls, 1 boy.







I have Lots of plans in my head will do them (probably the only true

thing he said, but seeing as all he told me was the first two points

and I had to ask questions to get all the rest, he would have had to

have been very slow not to figure that out!)







I dont have to worry, i will have a good job. (perfect, just waiting

for that to arrive now! :) )







I asked him the Secret to happiness and life cause I thought it may be

entertaining. Unfortunately not! He just said I cannot be told as it

is the future and you can&apos;t be told what is going to happen. Right....

So why are we at the witchdotors again?!!! :)







Most other people got told their family was missing them, they would

be glad to see them and they would have a party when they arrived

home, but not me! Ah-hem!!!!! Clearly you guys need to start missing

me more!!!! :)







I think i was freaking him out with all my questions and i was given a

strange handshake where he scratched the inside of my plam and smiled

and we parted ways. The interpreter couldn&apos;t say later what the

meaning of the handshake was either, &apos; maybe happiness&apos; he decided.







On our way home we stopped by a local bar to try the local drink,

Chibuku or shake shake as it is known as it comes in actual milk

cartons that are red, White and blue and say &apos;shake shake&apos; on them. It

is made from Sorgham (molasses), White maize, water, enzymes and

yeast. And it is delicious as it sounds. SO delicious we managed a sip

each of the milky sweet beer tasting substance with chunks of grains

floating in it before passing it back to the locals. It is apparantly

3.9% alcohol, or something close to that, and I believe it is made by

the same people that make Carslberg beer.







It was really, realy hot and the sun was burning down, making us

extremely glad we had our umbrellas for shade as we made our way back

to the markets outside our campsite. They were all locally made

handcrafted wood carvings and they were beautiful! Unfortunately I

thought that they might just be dust collectors that look amazing here

but are useless when you get them home so left them where they all

were. I was super tempted by a few things though - a beautiful teak

Noahs Ark with 2 of each animal all individually carved, Noah, Mrs

Noah, and they all fitted back inside! Elaborately carved wood chairs

- they are 2 pieces, one piece makes the back and stand and the seat

slots through and is also the stand at the back. Hard to describe

sorry! But beautiful, and in all sizes, from about shin high (that

could still hold your weight) to about chest high, all carved with

beautiful animals and African designs. And then a coffee table! There

were 2 kinds, either with a 3 leg folding base, or with an individual

carved leg, all with stunning carved designs similiar to the chairs.

Probably not so practical to try and put a cup of anything on though

with all the holes! Oh, and a picture frame with a family of four

Africans carved into it as the picture! Quite cool!







It is a definite pain in the ass that each country in Africa has their

own currency! Attempting to figure out how much you will need, find

somewhere to exchange it or get hefty fees on the ATM and then the

inevitable attempt to either use up every last penny on crap or find

somewhere to exchange it where you are not losing out so you can still

afford to eat by the end of the trip! So annoying!







It was hard work at the markets as there were touts everywhere that

wanted to show you their goods, convince you to buy their things,

start to bargain a price and it was so much hassle when you just

wanted to have a look around! Between that and the burning hot sun it

was far too much and I had to head inside to have a rest! They did

trade as well as take money, so if you had old socks, shirts, hats,

towels, pretty much anything you wanted to get rid of you could swap

it instead. I got a carved animal necklace for an old pillow, but was

too hot to do any more!







We played another game of beach volleyball and did some pilates with Em.





I was starting to feel really tired, headachey, achey, nauseus and not

well which I thought might have been the heat, but little did I know

it was a sign of things to come!







There was a Pig on a spit and lentils for dinner, but I was

startingvto feel really sick and so hit the sack, hoping to be better

in the morning!
 
Chitimba to Kande Beach... And a blur of 3 days of tropical disease, Malawi

2010-12-18 to 2010-12-20

After a awful restless nights sleep boiling alive and being awake from

about half past 1, it was finally time to pack down and hit the road.

I immediately crashed out, feeling awful and was awoken by a

commotion, there was a bridge ahead of us workmen were building as

they pulled up various sections our driver Alois got out and walked

over it, dubious it would hold our weight. After some discussions it

was decided we would go ahead and made it unscathed.



day 28, 29, 30







Along the way I was awoken several times by shouts of people seeing

rolled and totally crushed trucks on the side of the road. Pretty

awful. But so common.







Our first shop stop for the day had a pharmacy next door. Attempting

to find anti-nausea medication, I was given a little plastic bag with

little pink pills and told to take them. A little dubious I asked for

the information sheet. Still none the wiser on what they were or what

they actually did i had to laugh though as I read the first of half an

inch of side effects- nausea and vomiting. Effective anti- nausea

medication then hey! I think I&apos;ll be fine :)







Next stop was the local Market. We had just drawn names out of a hat

and were required to buy a costume for 500 kwacha (about 3.25 USD) for

that person to wear at our fancy dress party in 2 nights time. As we

entered the markets, people came running at us with giant plastic bags

full of dress up clothes which they then convinced us to buy. It was

so crowded and hot and with so many people in your face holding up

pyjames, 80&apos;s style dresses, and anything else you can think of it was

too much and I grabbed a crazy spiderman outfit for Nat and escaped as

quickly as possible.







As we continued we passed heaps of the local tukuyu tea plantations,

and so many banana plantations it looked like north Queensland!







Malawi is a landlocked country with 20% of it&apos;s total area made up of

Lake Malawi.... A freshwater lake that, once you swim in it, can give

you that delightful disrase where bugs enter through your skin,

Bilharzia. We were travelling along the western side, and our next

stop was Kande Beach campsite, and randomly saw some other Topdeck

friends, Boobs and Sutho! They were on a trip north and we were

randomly crossing for night which was awesome.







We set up our tents, wandered around the pretty little campsite on

the edge of the lake, checking out all the facilities and headed over

to lunch. I couldn&apos;t seem to eat and went to lay in a hammock in the

communal hut on the lakes edge to rest and get the ocean breeze. I

started to feel quite sick and lay down on one of the couches with a

sea breeze and a view of the island.... Let&apos;s call it malaria

island... And to make a long story short, that&apos;s pretty much where I

stayed for the next 3 days! I was all achey, headachey, faint, had a

stiff neck, so nauseus, had a sore bloated stomach, was feverish, so

hot and then cold, and so so tired and lethargic. My head was so

clouded and I felt so sick I couldn&apos;t move. A few people from our trip

were trying to work out what was wrong and apparantly after speaking

to ex pats at the camp who were veterans of 40+ malarias, it was

decided to start me on a course of malaria tablets. After having taken

panadol and rehydration salts all day and nothing in my stomach, I am

really pleased i had them as i was so sick, and rather that than

die! :) but i was sure super strong malaria pills were not the best

thing as I was given a cruskit which I tried to swallow and then the

malaria treatment.







So much for that witch doctor promising good health hey! :)





Luckily a few of the girls had decided to upgrade that night and

kindly offered to share beds so I could have a bed in their room with

a fan. I was so weak i could hardly walk as I was led to them room and

collapsed on the bed, being woken every few hours to be checked on,

given more tablets, or a cold cloth put on my head. Everyone was so

helpful, it was lovely.







It was a tough night though, I kept having the weirdest dreams, waking

up hot and cold and feeling so nauseus it was awful.





The next morning I could hardly walk and was taken back to the couch

with the ocean breeze and malaria island where I spent another blur of

a day lying there feeling so nauseus, weak and crap! There were times

when I felt better, and times when I felt worse. Not much fun! I

didn&apos;t even have the energy to get up and walk to the bathroom as I

was helped there each time, weak and faint and for the second day it

was impossible to eat.







I attempted to have a cold shower, but the strain was too much and I

couldn&apos;t even make it over to see the group and the fancy dress

costume reveal. The remainder of the group had the punch party we had

been planning all trip so it was a bummer to miss out on that! Our

tour leader Amy had found a doctor traveling on one of the other

trucks and lucky as it was to be my worst night yet.







I had now taken 2 out of the course of 3 malaria treatment tablets and

on an empty stomach I don&apos;t know what was making me feel Ill-er, them

or the sickness as they gave me reflux just to add to my nausea!







I felt SO faint, sick, nauseus and weak, but my constant intake of

panadol seemed to have solved most of the other problems. I began hot

and cold sweats, from burning up to shivering, freezing and rotated

these with having my head over a kitchen pot dry retching for hours as

I had nothing in my body to bring up. It was so so awful. I was really

sick and i could hear people at the door discussing what they were

going to do with me, how to get me to the doctor that was over 80kms

away... Which is a very long way without transport and on the roads in

Africa. Impossible, and then the one helpful suggestion I don&apos;t think

I&apos;ll ever forget &apos;we throw &apos;em in the lake&apos; in order to break the

fever. No!! Luckily Amy was there and I didn&apos;t get carted off to the

lake!





I then had some more medications that were able to stop my nausea and

I finally drifted off to sleep. I woke a short time later and felt so

much better I thought I may survive! The rest of the night was long as

I was up and down to the toilet, trying to keep cool when the power

and fans went off and not feel sick. The next morning dawned, me

pleased the night was over!







Amy and the doctor, Kaya, were so good, and again Amy literally spent

the entire night, like 12 hours worth coming in every half hour to

check on me. It was kind of funny later as I felt better that I could

always tell when she was coming as the fancy dress owen had brought

for her to wear was one of those big bags you can buy from the $2

store, ( like the stripey or check ones you see homeless people with

or people with heaps of checked baggage on aeroplanes ) and you could

hear it rustling from a mile away!







The next day was again spent situation no change lying on the coach,

weak, nauseous, waiting to get better, when I opened my eyes and saw

one of my best mates Monty sitting there! I thought it was a dream

when Mick popped up behind her and they starting talking! I couldn&apos;t

believe it! I was so happy I was crying as we all hugged and I heard

all their stories since we had last parted ways in Arusha last week.

Their truck had just arrived and so we were together one night before

my truck left the next morning! We hung out for the evening, well

okay, I lay there useless and Monty was amazing helping out and making

me feel better! The monty-dote solution! Soon i was crashing out as we

said our farewells through the mosquito netting, and so glad I had

been able to see Monty and Mick again as we didn&apos;t think our paths

would cross again! And made me feel heaps better, ready to face the

night as I was not looking forward to it after the last one, but

luckily it was nowhere near as bad.
 
Where men in white coats pose as doctors. Kande beach, via Lilongwe, Malawi to Chapata&amp;Lusaka Zamb

2010-12-21 to 2010-12-22

I was dreading getting on the bus today for another long drive day. I

was feeling nauseus, weak and sick, but relatively okay considering as

we drove out at 6am. Luckily the weather was quite cool as we began

our journey towards the capital of Malawi, Lilongwe. It was lunch time

as we arrived and I felt sick, hot and definitely ready to get off the

bus!!







Amy organised a cab and we drove out to the ABC clinic to see a

doctor. The clinic was clean and new looking, but the receptionist

informed us that 15 mins ago they stopped taking referrals. We could

get immediate bloods done at the lab though so we walked down the

corridor and finding the relevant name tag knocked. Someone yelled

&apos;yes!&apos; and looking at each other questioningly we opened the door and

walked straight into the lab as they continued on with their various

blood samples. We asked for a malaria test, but that&apos;s where it became

tricky.... As I had already had the malaria treatment it wouldn&apos;t show

in a malaria test. So we were to do that one, and also an antibody

test which would apparently show up to two weeks after having

malaria....except only if was for the common Malawi malaria.... Which

I clearly did not have as I would have contracted it in one of the

previous countries I had been in. So, just right there in the side of

the lab, a finger prick and blood smear later both were negative. That

had just taken 10 mins and so we then tried a random blood test, which

I am still not sure what it achieved. A needle in the arm and we

watched him feed the blood into a machine, get a small printout and

then walk us to see a doctor. The &apos;doctor&apos; was sitting at a desk

reading a book as I entered, and I wish I had bothered to ask what

book it was as it was clearly more interesting than treating a

patient. He told me &apos;maybe you had malaria, maybe you didn&apos;t &apos; and

that was it! I was ropable and spent the next ten minutes trying to

explain to him how that was not good enough, and why I needed to know,

which he did not get. He then decided that it wasn&apos;t malaria as I had

just arrived in Malawi. I then explained that I had already spent 2

months in Africa and where I had been. He then asked me if those

countries had malaria, to which I explained that WHO map that shows

high risk areas as red, which he had never heard of. So he then

decided that I did have malaria.







Not sure why I wanted to waste any more of my time I then explained my

symptoms to him, explained I had gotten better after taking the

malaria treatment and asked what other things that could be.

Apparantly nothing. Okay, but I was still sick, what should I do? And

what if it gets worse? The answer- take painkillers and see a doctor!

Argh!







We went around in circles a few more times before I left shaking me

head. I had also tried again to get anti nausea treatment, but between

antacid and cough syrup, I decided to leave without it. 26USD later

and then another 30USD for the 5 min taxi ride I was a little pissed

off and super disappointed. I then had 10 mins to attempt to get anti

nausea medication from another pharmacy =fail; This time I was told to

take travel sickness tablets. Then just time to run into the

supermarket, find a bathroom, find something for lunch that wouldn&apos;t

make me vomit and spend my leftover Malawian kwacha. Clearly it was

never going to happen and the effort left me so exhausted, hot and

tired I felt like death again and the last thing I wanted to do was

get back onto the truck.







But back on and to the border, which was surprisingly, but thankfully

a super easy process at the Malawaian side, and only about 2 touts in

the entire place as we walked through to Zambia and waited about an

hour for all our viasa to be proessed. Another 50USD gone!







From here it was just less than an hour to the campsite and just as

well as I was well and truly over the day! We arrived to Mama Rulez

campsite, Chapata, which was quite pretty, full of trees, a really

nice dining area, big pool with a waterslide, playarea, bar, but no,

the shower was still lacking pressure and cold!







I was feeling pretty crap so was glad when it was time for dinner and

even managed to eat some fish before thankfully going to bed and

hoping for a better night.







I was so utterly exhausted after the regular morning routine of

packing down, breakfast and onto the bus that I was not looking

forward to another drive day. Luckily for me, our cook Duncan had

given up his seat at the front of the truck so I could ride shotgun

with our driver Alois, and hopefully feel better. It was so nice to

have a view out the front window, be facing forwards and have my own

window! Zambia was also a surprisingly beautiful country as well, so

green, tropical and hardly any towns, so lots if beautiful

countryside. I also got to see so many little baby animals we had to

slow down for, goat kids, baby pigs, dogs, a baboon, and even a

toddler at one point just wandering down the road! I also saw a

mongoose dart across which was the highlight of the day. And so many

people walking! I think that is the national past time of Africa!







Talking to Alois I also learnt that Somalia had quite a large

terrorist organisation and that the government of Uganda was commuting

resources to try and stop it spreading. As a result, on Monday (Wed

today) the al s ........ ?Terrorist cell had put a suicide bomber on a

Kampala Coach in Nairobi and it had killed 3 people. I was in absolute

shock as just last month I had been on that exact coach there!! Wow!







I also learnt about Alois&apos; background. He was actually Masai, and had

grown up in the Masai Mara game reserve, where we had been game

driving last month. Missionaries had come in and decided that he

should be sent to school and as a result, he, the youngest of 6

children was sent to get an education. He had to drop out as the

missionaries changed and he had no way to pay the school fees and

looked after the family cows for a year when he was high school age.

The new missionaries came around and asked if he wanted to go back to

school, but Aloos saw no future gain with just high school and asked

to get a trade as a mechanic instead. He got his trade and during the

holidays when he came home, as the Masai are nomadic, sometimes his

family would be far away and he would have to stay at the mission and

work there as he could not get to them. On completion of his training

he continued to work at the mission until one day a tour company truck

broke down, he was asked to repair it, was offered a job, sent out on

his first trip and has been on the road ever since... Like 15 years or

something!







I was feeling nauseus still, my fifth day unable to eat, and so

lethargic and weak.... That I knew I had no choice and forced down

food at every meal. We were headed to the capital of Zambia, Lusaka

and I figured it was a god opportunity to try and see another

&apos;doctor&apos;. The city was lovely and clean, well looked after and modern

as we started driving through I was super impressed. Amy and I were

dropped off at a massive shopping mall where it was thought a medical

centre was and we just wanted to go indoors and bask in the normalness!







Unfortunately there was no medical and we had to barter with a taxi to

take us down to cfb. It was big, new, clean and the reception spoke

English and was friendly! Score! We had to pay several hundred

thousand kwacha (73 USD) to see a doctor and then headed to the

waiting room with seats and english magazines! The wait was only about

10 mins which was also nice and I went in to explain my situation, he

actually listened, did a few quick checks and sent me off for tests,

fairly confident it was malaria. Again upstairs to pay another 35 USD

down to see the friendly lab guy who was efficient, happy and all his

things were clean and new... Even if he did drag the needle down my

arm to create a small cut and then press a cotton ball covered in

alcohol to it to stop the bleeding. Ow! He smiled &apos;to stop infection&apos;.

Hmmm!







I had earlier convinced the doctor to wait around to see me with the

results and he was getting grumpy as I arrived back at the allocated

time and the results were still 10 mins off. By the time they arrived,

he called me in, found the malaria test negative as I had taken the

treatment tablets as I had told him, it was all too hard for him as he

stood up with the folder under his arm. &apos;Stay here, 4 or 5 days, rest,

then you will be fine.&apos; I attempted to continue questions as he walked

out the door. Doh! No further!







Disheartened we got a cab who got us lost, and then out to Eureka

Campsite to meet up with the truck, which was quite a cute little

campsite. have hot showers, attempt to eat some soup, steak, pasta and

veg for dinner and sleep! Big exhausting day!



day 31- 32
 
An African Christmas Begins. Lusaka to livingstone, Zambia to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe

2010-12-23 to 2010-12-24

Yay! I was finally starting to feel better as packed up and hit the road, a couple of zebra wandering into the campsite right next to us munching on the grass! There was also a massive herd of impalas just sitting right outside the gate!





It was getting close to Christmas as we started the day with carols as we drove on towards our shop stop. It took several hours, but we arrived at Livingstone and headed towards a new shopping complex where it was our last opportunity to buy a present for our Secret Santa. And it was tough! African supermarkets not quite cutting what we needed and all other stores out of range with our $5 limit.





Just a few more minutes to Waterfront, Our lovely campsite with a bar, swimming pool and gorgeous view right out onto the Zambeze River. Some of our group opted to head out on a sunset booze cruise, but we decided watching a free sunset from the bar was much nicer! And lovely it was as the sun set and the beautiful colours lit up the sky and water.





Heading back to the truck, there was just 6 of us left for dinner as we had the most delicious roast chicken and flavoured brocolli and cauliflower and herbed potatoes. I now had my appetite back and it was one of my favourite dinners all trip.





Although I loved the campsite, I did not love the absolute ridiculous amount of bugs it had! The ants had infested our tents and there were flying and crawling critters everywhere!! There was also a cute family of monkeys in the trees which was nice... As long as they stayed out of rabies biting distance! :)





Christmas Eve! As we were losing Debbie here, we had decided to give our Secret Santa presents this morning so everyone could be involved. Sitting on our camp chairs we all received our presents and opened them one by one. I had received some African thongs (my current ones were 2 sizes too big!), corn snacks, dried fruit (delicious!!) and a Tupperware container which is super handy on the road for leftovers!! Really handy presents!





As we sat there we saw some giant baboons around the bushes about 20m or so away. Super giant, like over a metre! And then we hear a yell and one is stealing breakfast off the table of the other overland truck!! Hilarious!!!







We only had 13km to the border so it was a nice easy morning, and a super easy painless border too with no touts, no hassles and no people!







In no mans land Between the Borders of Zambia and Zimbabwe is the Victoria Falls gorge that we pass over on the bridge. Pretty cool!







Zimbabwe is the old Rhodesia, named after its British coloniser, (1888) Cecil John Rhodes, who made his fortune in diamonds. Zimbabwe gained indepandance in 1980, it&apos;s first PM Robert Mugabe. Over 20 years later, after corrupt leadership, the wconomy was in dire straits and Mugabe began violently confiscating land from White farmers for supporting the opposition. Between the effects of this and various other campaigns targeting the poor, the livelihood of 700 000 Zimbabweans were affected (indirectly 1 in 5) and the country was according to the UN &apos;the worst possible thing at the worst possible time.&apos; &apos;deeper in poverty, deprivation, and destitution.&apos;







Previously $8Z = $1USD, but After the hyper inflation (1200%!!) of the Zimbabwean dollar, the currency became worthless. So worthless that bearer cheques of up to 100 trillion dollars were printed to try and cope, but it got to the point that the Zimbabwean currency was devalueing by the day and the 100 trillion was worth just $2USD. In 2008, the country transitioned to US dollars, (and randomly pairs that with South African Rand coins!), and now Zimbabwe is the place where old US dollars go to die. The notes are so old, brown, crumpled and disgusting, it is hard to tell which note is which, and it feels like they are going to tear apart in your hands. It is a really awful tale though when you hear it from locals, such as our crew though  and what they all lost out and the piles of worthless currency they now have as they didn&apos;t trust the banks.







Arriving in the town of Vic Falls we were pleasantly surprised to find a cute little town and our campsite, Rest Camp, right in it, not miles outside as we had become accustomed!







We were dropped across the road at Wild Horizons, the activity planning centre and then set up camp, ( later finding a family of warthogs sitting outside our tents!) and walked through town, finding everything quite expensive. I guess you get that in the tourist towns! We were sick of the heat and sick of being hassled by every man and his dog to buy something off them! We finally found the local markets and were finally able to find some beautiful stone carvings, cute little animals all lined up and all kinds of different things and wandered around there for a while, where I managed to swap some stickers for some souvenirs and then buy.... 100 trillion dollars! The Zimbabwean dollars are worthless, but you can buy the real currency as souveniers. I guess that makes me a trillionaire! :)







It was more than I had done in a long time, so it was definitely time to relax and have a rest before Christmas Dinner! We were having our group Christmas Dinner on Christmas Eve as the trip finished for some of our group the next morning. We gathered in the campsite restaurant and feasted on turkey, veg and Christmas pudding for dessert. A traditional performing group arrived and sung and danced, singing &apos;wimoweh&apos; and then some Christmas carols which were amazing. Most of the group were having one last party, but still unwell it was time to retire to bed.
 
Merry Christmas!

2010-12-24 to 2010-12-25

Christmas! Walking with the lions. Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

2010-12-25 to 2010-12-26

It was about 5am when I heard &apos;ho &apos;ho &apos;ho-ing&apos; outside the tent and three guys dressed in full Santa suits came in throwing lollypops and proclaiming &apos;Merry Christmas!&apos; We had again randomly met up with some more Topdeck friends, Timmy, Mitch and Rubes who were also on a trip heading north and were at our campsite spreading Christmas Cheer!







I figured seeing as I was up I may as well call home as I watched a gorgeous sunrise over the campsite. Christmas Day!!! The local girls were all in the showers, so friendly, saying hello and singing with their beautiful voices as I stopped to listen.







We had our final breakfast with our crew Amy, Alois and Duncan as they were taking a trip back north, and we were to have a new crew for the remainder of our trip south. It was time to pack up, clean out our tents and relocate to the new truck. Another  bit of the never ending hand washing.... I will never take washing facilities for granted again! :) and then it was time to walk with the lions!!!!







Owen, Danae, Anna and I joined a few Americans for the 20 min drive out to the centre. We sat down and were explained about  Alert - african lion and environmental research trust facilitation. Its role is promotion of sound conservation and management for african lions to support the rehabilitation and release into the wild.

as their numbers had dropped from 200 000 in 1975 to estimated reports of between 16500 and 20-30 000 just a few years ago.  Www.lionalert.org  is the website and the charity was just set up in 2005, to try and assist the declining numbers so only stages 1 and 2 have been undertaken.







In stage 1, lions as young as six weeks are taken on walks to allow them to build their confidence in the African bush and allow their natual hunting instincts to develop; a necessary part of their pre release training. Volunteers, staff and visitors act as the other dominant members of the pride..... That is what we were there to do!!







There are then documented Stages 2-4 to train them for release into the wild, introducing them to hunting, living in a pride, living and co-existing with the other animals in their environment, breeding and having absoutely no human contact at all.







We watched a short video, got given our sticks and learnt how to use them to stay in control of the lions and seperated to begin our activities. Our guide, JB took us outside the hut and around the corner there were 2 lions just sitting there!!! The lions were 13 month old male and female twins called Mvuthu and Monde and we were taking them walking!







They were big! But they were used to the routine and they took the lead heading out on a path as we, and several other staff followed. The lions were really really hot in the heat and were panting heavily as they flopped down to rest after less than 10 minutes! It was a good opportunity for a photo with them though... Just Monde, the female, as Mvuthu the male is &apos;a bit skittish&apos;.







Getting them moving again, the staff encouraged us to take turns walking with them. Sticks in hand we walked like Masai cow herders... It was awesome! You had to stay at a certain place behind them and it was tough trying to walk through the bush doing it! You could even pat them as you went, provided you stayed in the right non threatening spot. They were just pure muscle!!!







As we walked along, the Lions split up at times and disappeared onto the bush, the trainers herding them back onto the path so we knew where they were... Often snarling and hissing as they didn&apos;t want to get up from a rest in the shade! It was like National Geographic as we arrived at a waterhole and they rested on their haunches to drink and then had a play fight with each other, not 10 metres from where we were standing. It was crazy!!! Jumping on each other, play biting, swiping with their giant paws, Mvuthu even falling down about a metre embankment on the rivers edge... And still landing gracefully on his feet! Amazing!







We were then lucky enough to see the babies! They were 6 months old and so cute! Their names I don&apos;t remember.... One was Chobe though! And all &apos;C&apos; names.  Two males and one female. The names are all organised by letters as to the family they come from so no inbreeding occurs.







They were about dog size and so cute! They had such pretty faces and big beautiful eyes that looked up at us. These were a lot quieter and we could get closer to pat them; one even rolling over as I patted him, just like a pet so I could rub his belly and under his chin!







Soon it was all over and we watched the DVD they had made whilst we had some snacks. It was amazing footage of the lions playing, but not something you would pay 35 dollars to buy. It was so funny too, even over the music you could hear the trainers going &apos;catch up&apos; telling us to move quicker and get to the right place behind the lions to walk!







We were dropped home and Anna and I walked down to the supermarket, but it was just far too hot as I returned to lie in the shade for a few hours and regroup my energy for the rest of the day. Glad to be away from the touts constantly saying &apos;i like your shoes&apos;, &apos;trade your shoes&apos;. So annoying!







I did arrive back to camp to find a delightful Vervet monkey sitting on my washing. Attempting to scare him away he just stayed his ground and hissed nastily. Fair enough! I don&apos;t want rabies today! You can stay!







Later that afternoon Annika and I walked down to the Victoria Falls Hotel which has been open since 1904 and is the place where anyone who was anyone came to stay at to see the Falls ( for a cool $280 USD per night). There is a massive arch to enter through and we watched as the gorgeous old steam train dropped off all its passengers right in front of the hotel as they staggered in under the heat and the bellboys followed up with all their luggage!







It just seemed to be so colonial English with a few staff members in the old safari type outfits, complete with hats and Inside we watched as people ate delicious looking high tea overlooking gorgeous view of the Victoria Falls gorge.







We walked around the extensive, well looked after grounds, having a cold drink at the pool, watching the mist from the falls and listening to the amazing Piano player inside tinkling away.







Annika had yet to have lunch and we stopped in at the fast food &apos;pizza inn&apos;, &apos;chicken inn&apos; and &apos;creamy inn&apos; for her to grab a Burger. After waiting for at least 15 mins, she  finally got to order... But they then rejected her money as there was a small rip in it. We were amazed having seen the state of most of the other money here. After talking to the manager, he grumpily agreed to accept it and we waited over another 25 minutes to get her burger. And all the time one song was playing on repeat &apos;as I got older, I will be stronger..... They call it freedom, just like a waving fly...!&apos; -  knaan, waving flag - the South African Soccer World Cup song. We thought it funny at first, but after the zillionth time on repeat, the heat and a trillion people squashing around us we were about to go insane!!!!







We met at the pool and walked down to have Dinner at Africa Hide, a local restaurant in town with lovely sweet waiters in cute little animal covered uniforms and Santa Hats. I had a delicious Eland steak, which was so lean and tender and delicious! (Eland are the largest antelope in the world.)







We said a few more goodbyes to a few more of our group and hit the sack as We had decided to get up at the crack of dawn and head out to watch the sunrise. Alas, someone had different plans as just before 4am it began to bucket down as we quickly secured the windows on the tent as I managed to drop my clean washing into the mud!!! Doh!!!! Unfortunately it continued for several hours, foiling all sunrise plans, but stopping in time for us to meet the new passengers joining us at breakfast! We met also our new cook Benson, driver Dinge and tour leader Alan, all local guys.





And after being here for three days we were finally going to go and see the falls!!! Owen had also come down with some awful stomach bug so at least the pace was nice and slow... My only current speed! As we walked through town and down to the entrance to Victoria Falls, current cost $30 USD.... Cost 10 years ago.... $2.50 USD!!!!!!







Although contentious, as literature of earlier traders and locals state otherwise, The falls are said to be discovered by Dr Livingstone, the Englishman out searching for the source of the Nile back in 1855, and named after the Queen of England at the time, although they are also still known by their local name Mosi-oa-Tunya or &apos;the smoke that thunders.&apos;







Stemming from the mighty Zambezi River, Vic Falls is the Worlds largest fleet of flowing water at 1.7km wide and both Hippos and Elephants have been swept away and gone over the falls the water is so strong!!!!!







We began along the walkway to see the Dr Livingstone statue and the first of the viewpoints around the track. The first view we had an amazing amount of thundering water and a lot of mist. As we continued around the track, it angled so we got more and more of a view of the length of the falls. They were amazingly spectacular simply because of the length of identical simultaneous waterfalls and how close you could stand to the edge to watch them cascade down on the opposite side. Between each lookout we had a pretty walk through the rainforest and rotated between not getting wet at all to being drenched by the wind taking the spray!





We watched where the White water rafters would begin their journey and then walked to the bridge and watched a few fearless souls bungy jump the 105m from it. We were shattered and turned back to walk out and back, past families of warthogs and baboons to have a rest in the airconditioned Internet room and then a nap at camp! My biggest day yet since my illness and I was shattered!







Annika, Owen, Danae and I caught a taxi the 4km down to Victoria Falls Safari Lodge ( www.vfsl.com ). It was beautiful! Definitely the place I would stay at if I had all the money in the world! Away from the city and set entirely amongst the natural surroundings, the place was so cool with thatched roofs, and a view as far as the eye could see. We sat on the balcony overlooking buffalos, warthogs, vultures and Malibu storks at the waterhole. Amazing! We had a drink and ordered a delicious ( and surprisingly good value...$8USD for the service and location!)  dinner ( we did manage to wangle the &apos;before 6pm&apos; menu as it was 2 minutes to 6! Score! :) )as we sat watching the sunset!!! Amazing! After an exhausting full day for me still trying to recover I was crashed out in bed before 8pm! So good!





Day 36,36
 
Sunrise, Electric Fences, passports and apples. Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe to Kasane, (Chobe) Botswana

2010-12-27

The alarm went off at 0445h as Annika and I struggled out of bed and down the road to try and catch the sunrise. The pink colours were starting to spread across the sky and we started running down the road to make it! Well for a total of about 1 minute when we realised I was still too sick to be able! I had the brainwave of short cutting down the train tracks as there was a station right outside the Vic Falls Hotel, even though Annika thought it would take us longer... And yup, she was right as the exit from the station was all locked up and barbed wire covered the fence. Doh! Unperterbed we called over a security guard, who did not have the keys, and we are sure did not understand us, but at least he didn&apos;t stop us as we not so gracefully climbed the fence!!





Luckily there were no more roadblocks, just closed doors that opened at our touch as we entered the empty Victoria Falls Hotel ( www. ....... ) ( a cool $280 dollars a night for the cheapest room) and exited out the other side as we excitedly watched the massive spray of mist from the falls and the bridge over the gorge become clear in the breaking light. With all the clouds it was difficult to tell exactly what direction the sun was rising in and so we scampered off through the unkept grass to the far edge of the property to a break in the vegetation. The colours spilt across the sky as we stood on the edge of a fence boundary like &apos;the boy in the striped pyjames&apos;. Trying to obtain a better photo I tested the fence, no problem, and so then leant my weight onto it. &apos;zap!!!!&apos; as I jumped back a mile feeling the thud in my heart. Yup, it&apos;s electric!!





We stood at the fence watching the day break before finding a better spot to see the actual sun rising, which was pretty, but there were a lot of clouds on the way. We walked back to the main viewpoint for one last view down the gorge to the falls, but approached from a different angle on the other side... And ta da! The trees were no longer obstructing and we had a breatiful view of the rising sun. Doh!!! Oh well, it was an adventure the way we had done it and finding it at the end we had an opportunity to see the last part anyway which was nice as we sat on the fence and enjoyed the view.







We arrived back at the campsite just in time for our 7am breakfast, pack up, say our goodbyes to our previous crew and hit the road on our new truck!!







Our new Tour Leader Alan asked if we had everything off our previous truck. We were going to pretend to him that our previous tour leader Amy had all our passports and so it was time to enact our joke! Owen simply said &apos;you have the passports from Amy right?&apos; as we chimed in with our matching &apos;yeah she gave them to you, yeah?&apos; &apos;no, she held them all&apos; etc as his face immediately fell and slowly drained of colour. I had to duck below chair level not to laugh as he swore beneath his breath and turned around and started yelling for the driver to stop. We carried it on until we all cracked up as Owen said &apos;naa don&apos;t worry, we have them&apos; as he turned, not sure what to do, what to think or whether to believe us before just swearing some more under his breath, shaking his head and sitting down no doubt wondering what on earth he had got himself in to with us!!!!





We continued on, stopping foe elephants to cross the road.  It was apparantly on 90km to the border, but must have been like 40 as we did it on less than an hour, quickly and painlessly passing through the Zimbabwean exit and then walking past a million dung beetles everywhere, before having to walk through solution to clean out shoes and the truck wheels also. A search was then conducted of the truck and amongst other things they confiscated my apples and grapefruit! Not happy jan!! Apparantly they are really strict.







Pulling into town, we had a shop stop in Kasane for our cook, Ben to buy his supplies, but unfortunately everything was closed due to another public holiday! Botswana is the place to live!







The Spar supermarket was open though and one of the best we had seen and they even had... Frozen yoghurt!!!! Well, it was just regular yoghurt they had put in the freezer, but still, delicious!







As we drove into Thebe River Safari Lodge, Kasani, our campsite for the night we marvelled at its location right on the river and then stared at the electric fence and barbed wire on the perimeter - To keep us safe from the hippos, elephants and alligators that roam these areas.  It&apos;s a little sad how quickly you become acustomed and therefore blasé!  As we set up camp we noticed an elephant literally just outside the fence and less than 50m from us as we all looked up and just went back to our lunch!! Sad hey!!!





Some of our group had opted to pay for a game drive around Chobe National Park and so the rest of us chilled out for the afternoon, I was really glad for the opportunity as I was SO tired I just crashed out. Definitely tired of being sick now! :) We had a tomato chicken, rice and veg dinner before 8pm! Wow! Bedtime! And quite cool as you lay in your tents you could just hear the sounds of hippos grunting in the river right on the other side of the fence!




 
&apos;Naa, you won&apos;t need a rain jacket!&apos; Kasane, Chobe,  Maun, Botswana

2010-12-28 to 2010-12-29

We heard the guys heading off on the Chobe game drive about 5, but we had a sleep in til 0730 which was a nice treat.







I already felt much better than I had yesterday so was excited that hopefully tomorrow I would feel even better and then be well again!









We have no chores on this trip- the crew do it all,  which is a total reversal to last part of the trip, and now we seem to have so much free time!







It was again time for the never ending task of washing clothes. Washing machines I so cannot wait to see you again!









We spent the rest of the morning chillaxing before heading into town for an hour where the truck accidently ran into a low hanging power line and cut off power for a few local businesses. Oops! No one got electrocuted though so happy ending for us!







The day flew by and before we knew it, our tour leader Alan was saying &apos;&apos;Naa, you won&apos;t need a rain jacket!&apos; as we prepared for our Cruise along the Chobe River. Quite a cool river as it Borders Chobe National Park, is the border between Zimbabwe and Botswana, and later turns into the Zambezi River that borders Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe and turns into Vic Falls!







We were a little disappointed at first as we saw basically a large tinny with seats jammed in, but it was really pretty and nice and peaceful as we motored across the water and we began to see the wildlife. We saw lots of hippo eyes and ears looking at us out of the water, and then some Red Letche, which look a lot like Impala. We saw some waterbuck drinking from the edge, which as it turned around had a massive white circle around its butt, like a target! We came across a big old croc lying on the edge of the bank, about 3m long and lots of smaller ones on the bank and in the water as well as  lots of birds, including ibis feasting on a carcass.









And suddenly we saw Hippos out of the water!! Yay!!! They are huge! And cute little faces as they turned to look at us, and some ran startled, quite quick! We saw elephants striding by them, it was so cool!









We could see various hippos in the water and at times we did some big swerves and gunned the engine super fast to get out of there as it would be bad news for all of us if the hippo got to us, surfaced and tipped the boat!!! At one stage we saw a hippo to the left of us who disappeared under, then came up in a kind of butterfly swimming motion, head, then back, head, then.... The driver gunned the engine and we were out of there! running away from hippos! We required to do it a few times and we thought it hilarious! probably not so hilarious if they got to us, but at the time, brilliant! :)







The sun was just starting to set as we had to turn the boat around.... Straight into the mass of grey clouds and rain streaming down ahead. Our first introduction to the unpredictable weather Botswana is famous for! Our guide uttered the unnecessay words - &apos;you are going to get wet!&apos; as we started head on to the waves, water flying in, wind and rain from the other directions. In some kind of ridiculous brainwave, the driver decided it would be a good idea to pull into the side and wait for it to pass, even though there was no end in sight. Although we were all already wet and freezing, we sat there trying to huddle away from the wind and rain., to no avail. We all screamed at him to continue, and 5 minutes later when he finally got the message, we did randomly did a 360&apos; turn, just so the back of us could get wet also! Awesome! Laughing hysterically at our predicament, we then powered home, huddling together and trying not to notice the cold wind and wet spray and rain coming right at us.







Ahead we saw an elephant standing on the left hand side bank, and as we watched it started wading into the water, putting it&apos;s trunk up as a snorkel and crossing to the other side!! So cool! Once again like we were watching National Geographic!!







The rain temporarily forgotten,  we then re-huddled back down to get back to truck and find our crew laughing. A good introduction to Botswana weather!







Looking forward to a hot shower, I looked questionally at the sky seeing as the ammenities were a fair walk away and was again told by Alan &apos;naa, you&apos;ll be fine! you won&apos;t need a rainjacket!&apos; hmm I should have learnt! After a not so hot shower we were then trapped as again.... Rain, Rain, Rain!







After our typical African dinner of Sadza, the local version of Ugali, or corn meal play dough ( actually the best version I have tried!), the local spinach, chomolia, and beef or vegetarian sausage,  it was about a 20 min mission to attempt to get to the bathrooms, slip sliding over the mud, carefully walking across the new rivers and attempting to get there and back unscathed!







We did look like a local gypsy camp too with us all having soaking wet clothes from the boat ride all hanging from the rafters inside our shelter!







Luckily the rain had abated overnight so everything was only semi wet as we packed up on the dark, watched a beautiful multiple colour sunrise as we ate breakfast, and then were on the road by 6am.







Again I was feeling better.... So happy!

We had about 600km to go today, and

Started the day trying to avoid elephants and donkeys on the road, as zebra and ostrich ran beside us. Quite cool!







We passed through vetinary checkpoints, which I thought was weird within a country, where we again had to walk, and the truck drive through the germ killing solution and he checked for animals, animal and plant products.







As we stopped in at a service station to pick up cooking supplies, we thought we were on fire! We had covered almsot 300km and were halfway and it was only jalf past 9! But then our driver Dinge spent the time underneath the truck... oil leak in the diff! Doh! We spent over an hour trying to fix it... Well, they spent an hour! Before we drove across the road to the welding store and the guys spent another hour sorting it out before we were on the road! Woohoo!!!







The roads were bumpy, but we hit them at speed like a roller coaster jumping everywhere! We had a shop stop in Maun where we stocked up on water and snacks before arriving at Sitatunga, our campsite in Maun Whilst it was still light! Yay!







Graham, a kiwi who owns the campsite briefed us on our next few days in the Okavango Delta... The largest inland Delta in the world! So exciting!!









I was starting to feel unwell again and so forced down some corn on the cob and headed right for bed! Damn African Tropical diseases!!! :)
 
New Year in the most amazing place on earth! Maun to the Okavango Delta! Botswana

2010-12-30 to 2011-01-01

We cheerily packed down our tents and put our overnight bags to one side, ready to head out into the Okavango Delta, the largest inland Delta in the world! Some last minute poncho purchases and we were packing our things under the seats and sitting on  the outwards facing bench seats in the back of a truck... Just like being in the back of a mog in the Army again!







We had about an hour until we got to our launch point and we held on tight as we bumped our way across the bush tracks, trying not to be thrown off or get smashed by the tree branches and shrubs whipping us through the open sides.







We drove up to the side of the water and met our &apos;polers&apos; from the Delta Rain company we were going with; the people who &apos;drive the traditional mekoro (pl, singular- mokoro)  which are shallow dugout canoes of fibreglass or sausage trees poled from a standing position, kind of like the gondolas in Venice or the punts in Oxford and Cambridge.







Danae and I had a local poler named Joe and we all lathered ourselves in sunscreen and covered up with sarongs and towels and anything else we could think of to try and minimise the impact of the roasting sun beating down on us and reflecting off the water. And we were off! Immediately we loved it as we lay in our mokoro and glided through the reeds and water lillies! It was amazing! So peaceful and so beautiful and so nice to be part of nature with such little environmental impact.







Okavango Delta is probably the most famous attraction in Botswana. The 1430km Okavango River begins in Angola, crosses Namibia and enters Botswana where 18.5 billion cu metres of water annually spread until it is swallowed by the Kalahari desert.







The Delta is a 16 000 sq km maze of wetlands - lagoons, channels and islands full of wildlife! We could not wait!!!







We shielded ourselves as we were wacked in the heads as we ploughed through the reeds. It was the coolest thing ever! Very soon the beating sun became too much as we tried our best to hide under our layers as we dehydrated and our sweat absolutely drenched our sleeping mats we were sitting on. So hot! But still so cool. :) As we were waiting to pull in at our campsite we heard a familiar grunting noise and Joe steered us around to a hippo pool just 10 metres away where a large male hippo was hiding in the water just another 10 metres from us! So cool!! When babies are born, they are taken away by their mothers and although  females are welcommed into the family after a few days, males are not as they would be killed. They are then required to learn to survive alone until they are fully grown! Hence this was a solo male.







We pulled up into our bushcamp by the side of the water, set up our tents, the boys dug the bush toilet... Hole :) You knew it was occupied if the toilet paper and shovel hanging from the tree at the start of the path were gone! :) and we settled in for some relaxing before lunch. In this area the sunshine and heat are too intense in the middle of the day and so they are designated rest periods. And we were so glad too!







As the day continued, our polers took Hayley, George and I out to a swimming area about 5 or so minutes away where we enjoyed cooling off in the waist deep water, trying to catch the tiny silverfish in our hands, and I even had a go at poling! Such good fun! A little challenging to steer though. :) Although the others did all stay in the water until I returned with the mokoro as they thought they would be tipped in otherwise! Such distrust! :) Waiting for our polers to return we decided to hijack the mokoro and take ourselves back as we quickly got in and tried to glide past, George at the helm. Hmm not so seamless as we got stuck on the bank and then struggled with the direction as the polers just laughed. I think it took us double the time to get it back to them! good fun though!







On the way back, the polers taught us how to make really cool necklaces from the waterlilles by starting to skin the stalk and then just snapping bit by bit of it off. Really cool! We also saw these really tiny little frogs, ......... Which are chameleon frogs! George managed to snap off a reed with one on it and we kept it as our pet for the journey.







It was then time to get into our hiking pants and neutral colours ready for our game walk. We caught the mekoro out to a nearby island, split into groups,  and our guide Reps advised us on the important matters. If you see a lion, stand really still and tall and look it on the eye. If you see an elephant, get downwind. If you see a buffalo coming for you, run! Get to a tree or termite nest and hide behind it so it gets confused and thinks you have gone. Then climb up as far and fast as you can! Right. Ready for the walk guys?!!! :)







It was just the start of rainy season so we were not expecting to see many animals as they had all walked across the land bridges elsewhere. We saw heaps of different birdlife, a thousand aardvark holes and footprints of hippos, warthogs, and a baby warthog!!!  zebras, aardvarks, badgers, giraffe and some kind of impala.







We got a lesson in poo... learning that a male hippo sprays his poo, due to a local legend that hippo are not allowed to eat any fish and so they spray their poo on the land so everyone can see they ate nothing but grass; and that a male giraffe has round balls of poo which are pointed at one end, whilst the female poo is not. And Big big big chunky grassy elephant poo.







The guides saw red lechwe (antelope) and steinbock, but they were too fast into the undergrowth for our eyes! The walk itself was stunning though, kind of rainforesty to start, short grass and open fields, long grass, dead trees, big trees, waterholes, sand patches and awesome White and grey cloud formations with the blue blue sky around them.







We watched the sun set as we walked, an awesome orange fireball setting against the backdrop of the trees.







We could see rain off in the distance, see lightening and hear the thunder, but then we started to get that fresh breeze that you know is just before the rain and we hurried back! We made it back for a spaghetti bolognaise dinner and washed the dishes just in time to dive into our tents as the rains came in! Not that i minded though as I was shattered! The biggest day I have had since I got sick, 3 weeks ago now. We sat in our tents listening to the wind, rain, thunder, lightening and listening to the heaps of different frogs before drifting off, hoping not to wake up in a puddle of water!







We awoke just after 5 to hear Barack, one of our local guides yelling good morning, happy new year, singing Christmas carol parts and generally loud and raucus to get us out of bed! New Years Eve! We were up, breakfasted and into the mekoro by 6, for our half hour boat ride to the island our morning walk was on. It was a gorgeous boat ride as the sun rose over the water, reflecting on the surface and all the beautiful reeds, lily pads and water lillies.







We split into our groups again and began our walk through the various different landscapes, seeing more aadvark holes, various animal footprints, animal dung like giant buffalo patties and seeing the destruction the elephants have caused, knocking over trees, tearing off the bark, breaking the termite mounds and making holes in the land to cool themselves off in!







There were long, sharp, spiky, black and white porcupine quills which were really really cool, quite a few birds and nice scenery. It was a long morning for me though and I was glad when we got back to the mokoros.... To find all the others had already given up and left! We jumped in our mokoros and headed back, watching as the rain clouds closed in.... And then overflowed! We quickly struggled to find our rain clothes and pull on our new ponchos over the top and not suffocate trying to get heads through the head holes! We were whipped by the wet reeds in our faces as we ducked and powered home. Luckily it was light and had stopped by the time we arrived back into camp to devour the eggs, bacon, beans and toast that our tour leader Alan had prepared in our absence. Delicious!







It was then time to relax and enjoy the isolation of the delta. We played cards, read books, tried to outwit each other with puzzles, enjoyed the landscape and had turns taking each other out poling on the mokoros, and no one even got tipped in! Close in some instances though! :) It was definitely different to just a whip around the swimming hole! So hard getting them through the reeds, trying to avoid the hippo pool, turning, going straight!!! We definitely appreciated the skill of our polers a lot more after that!







After lunch we caught the mokoros down to the swimming hole, and tried to catch the quick little silverfish that were swimming around us. It was weird, the water looked exactly like orange jelly when the sun came out!







Back at camp we got ready and headed out onto the mokoros for a sunset cruise! It was so beautiful as we cruised along in high spirits out to the hippo pool singing merrily along to 80&apos;s tuned. We stayed a safe distance away from the mother and child who were swimming there, and watched as they stood up in the shallow water and gave us a few massive yawns!







We had the perfect vantage position and sat in our mokoros watching the last sun of 2010 set over the amazing waterways, reflecting against the lilly pads, lillies, reeds and clear water.







It was the most amazing cruise, probably my favourie thing so far this trip and I didn&apos;t want it to end as darkness began to descend and we headed back to camp for dinner, watching the colours spread across the sky. Alan had cooked up a feast in our absence, but unfortunately full of things I couldn&apos;t eat. Ahh I cannot wait to get to Canada and be able to eat properly!







We started to play a few games and then all our polers preformed a few traditional songs and dances for us, and then moved onto more modern ones; one with a guy dressed with a giant butt and stomach, and another with them acting as frogs before We each took a turn to perform a song from our country.







By now the group were well and truly happy after the polers did a beer run to the nearest town for them and delivered to camp! And so still unable to drink after my tropical malarial epic a few weeks ago it was time to fade away. So annoying being sick and unable to participate in activities on holiday!







I woke up early in the morning... New Years Day 2011! It was so beautiful and still and clear as the bright orange sun rose across the grasslands, reflecting its blues to the sky and water as a myriad of bug life formed a chorus to welcome in the day! I certainly did not want to leave the delta as we packed up our things... Avoided the scorpion that was running around under the tents!!!! and headed back into the mokoros for the ride back.





...and found out there was a hippo that had come ashore less than 5m from our camp last night! Hippos kill the most people in Africa out of any animal! Our actions on hippo are - stay in your tent, don&apos;t put your torch on, don&apos;t move and don&apos;t leave to go to the bathroom!







The mokoro ride back went far too fast! We glided through the wetlands and met the truck that was to drive us back over the bumpy roads back to camp.







Words and pictures cannot possibly describe this place. The Okavango Delta is certainly one of the most amazing, beautiful, remote and untouched places I am sure I will ever have the privledge to see. Even though we were here in low season and there were very few animals about, the opportunity to see the natural environment is so amazing and beautiful it makes no difference at all. Definitely one of the coolest things I have done... And for the price - just $140 dollars for everything, I think the best value also.







It was time for a hot shower, lunch and clothes washing before hoping like hell the weather would hold for our exciting afternoon activity!







We bumped our way into town for a quick shop stop with pretty much everything closed for New Years Day and then off to Maun International Airport for our scenic flight over the Delta!!! It was just $65 USD for a 45 minute flight in a Cesna which when you think about what you get is amazing value that I could not pass up... especially seeing as the Delta was fast turning into my favourite place in Africa!







We had our passports and tickets checked, went through security, had our bags checked, couldn&apos;t take liquids, and sat in a departure gate waiting!! Just like a real flight!! There were 10 of us and we split into 2 groups of 5 and met our pilot Corey. And we were jammed inside and heading off down the runway for lift off!! It was super loud inside the tiny plane from the engine as we buzzed unsteadily up into the air. As we gained height up to 120m we could really gain a perspective of how massive the Delta really was, with it reaching off to the horizon in bright greens and blues in every direction we looked. Amazing!!!







The first 10 minutes was really beautiful, but no wildlife. Our pilot Corey entertained us by making us all scream as he banked sharply left and right, tipping us on massive angles. And then we saw an Elephant!!! We saw individual bulls walking on their own and then an entire herd! We saw them in the open, in amongst the trees, eating bark, walking towards the waterhole, crossing a waterway, flaring their ears... It was amazing! They were right under us at some point and to me looked exactly like the little icing elephants mum just to pipe when we were little! So wrinkly and comical!!!







We then saw a whole family of hippos in a lake which looked amazing from above. And then there was one out of the water! And then there were dozens, in and out of the water everywhere! So cool!







There was first just one red lechwe (antelope) and then there too were dozens in herds; giraffes hiding in the trees, buffalo, and then everywhere we looked we could see the various animals and birds everywhere!







It was so much fun and almost reminded me of &apos;Where&apos;s Wally&apos;, (the illustrated childrens picture books where you need to find a little man dressed in a stripey shirt in a busy scene) as we all searched out our windows, looking between trees, in lakes and through all the parts of the natural environment for animals, victoriously yelling &apos;giraffe!&apos; &apos;elephants&apos; &apos;hippos&apos; as we spotted the game.







Unfortunately it too soon came to an end, realising it was almost over as I yelled &apos;impala&apos;... &apos;oh hang on, cows!&apos;, and we were at the farming communities on the edge of the delta. We had a super smooth landing and it was back to camp for a chicken curry and rice and off to bed, listening to the massive roar of thunder in the distance and just waiting for it to hit!!!


 
Rain, rain, rain and the world&apos;s slowest money exchange. Maun, Botswana, Rundu to Etosha NP, Namibia

2011-01-02 to 2011-01-03

About 1030pm the rains came! A MASSIVE bolt of lightening and even bigger clap of thunder bolted us awake D and I stared at each other with giant wide eyes. Holy crap!!!! It was literally right on top of us and we just hoped our tent would hold up!!! Finally it began to drift further away, but the rain stayed and continued as we attempted to pack down our soaking wet tent in the dark and rain at 5 in the morning!







Breakfast was another wet state of affairs, but as we looked out onto the site just 30m away another overland truck had chosen, it was literally now a lake. Water covered the entire ground! We felt so lucky!







We unfortunately arrived at the border at the same time as another overland truck. Doh! It took so long, but the people on both sides were so friendly it made it so much nicer. It was a soggy walk over no mans land though, the roads were so so flooded and muddy!







We saw an imminent entirely dark grey sky about to engulf us and we quickly pulled out the tables and prepared lunch at the Namibian border! Crazy! How many places would let you do that?!!! The wind started to pick up and blow us away as we quickly finished pack up and made it onto the bus before we were too soaked! Timing!!







We were travelling along the Caprivi strip (that piece of land that looks out of place on a map of Namibia... that should belong to the country next door!) which is where 4 countries meet - Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe - and also serves to seperate Angola and Zambia from Bostwana. The random strip is the result of a deal between Britain and Germany in 1890 that gave Britain Zanzibar and Germany the Caprivi Strip (named for the German Chancellor at the time).







Our journey took us through the Mahango Game Park, but unfortunately there was nothing to see through the rain today!







We stopped about a thousand times for cows, donkeys and goats on the road and held onto our seats as we literally bounced everywhere across the roads to arrive at our shop stop where everything was closed; and then to Our campsite, Saresungu River Delta, in Rundu on the Kavango River, which is the Namibian name for the Okavango River.







We camped right on the water and literally 100m away, right on the other side was Angola!!







It was a wet wet evening as we had chicken skewers, veg and wedges for dinner before the rains came... And again we hoped our high ground would not be flooded out like the rest of the campsite as we tried to sleep being deafened by the worlds loudest frogs!!!







Yay for no rain this morning as we packed down our soggy tents, breakfasted in the little shelter and were on the road again!







We arrived at the red line fence and gate over the road now known as the Mururani gate. It is a significant location in Africa as in the 1960&apos;s it was used as a gate to control the spread of nationalism from the north to the south.







Our tour leader Alan also told us that the country was still recovering from apartheid and we may face Hostilites. We had received the first at the campsite the previous night when some couples who were in our camping site refused to let us camp there. Revenge was served at lunch the next day though when we pulled up to a picnic area on the side of the road and there they were, about to be innundated by an overland truck!







We had a Shop stop in Grootfontein and headed to the bank to exchange money. The queue was quite long, maybe 15 or so people and we joined the end. Immediately someone told us &apos;oh you should go down the side&apos;.  Sweet we thought, a quick queue for the foreign exchange! But the queue was roped off and as we walked over to it a security guard emphasized it was closed. As we talked to him he went &apos;oh! I didn&apos;t realise you were foreigners, sorry!&apos;, &apos;please come this way&apos;. And the &apos;closed&apos; line was opened up for us the foreigners and we were now first in the queue. Hmmmm interesting. I definitely felt weird receiving favouritism like that though.







D went first to exchange her money, but geez it was a slow process! After 15 mins when he was still processing on the computer, we quickly combined our money, and lucky we did as it took half an hour to do the one money exchange!!! We wouldn&apos;t have had enough time to do it seperately! So crazy!!!!







On the road again we were just eating lunch when Dinge our driver turned and said &apos;ohoh, rain&apos;. We soon felt those rain winds coming in, packed up and again managed to make it back in the bus with seconds to spare as the heavens opened on us!!! Perfect timing! We were getting good at this! It was crazy intense rain though as we shielded ourselves from the water streaming in through the joins of the windows!







Rain aside, Namibia does have a lot of good roadside stops and picnic points though, much better set out than any other country we have been to thus far in Africa!







We had another quick stop in the Mining town of Tsumeb for me to get some anti histimines for the crazy rash on my arms and for everyone who had upgraded at the last campsite to get calamine lotion as they had all gotten bed bugs or fleas and they were literally all totally covered in bites!!







The rain continued as we arrived into Etosha National Park. That  $3 poncho i brought in Maun was turning out to be the best money ever spent!!!







In the pouring rain we arrived at Namutoni campsite in the National Park to find upgrades cost $430 USD - the same as 3 days in the Serengeti!







The campsite was flooded as we drove around looking for a suitable location, but someone smiled on us as the weather cleared with just enough time for us to put up our tents and get back into the truck!







We had a game drive through Etosha National Park and it was simply stunning with the rain holding off to have the bright, bright green grass contrasting against the dark grey clouds in the sky.







We were worried we would see nothing with the weather, but as we left the campsite we saw banded mongoose and then almost immediately we saw a black faced impala, (different to the ones we had seen before) herds of springbok, blue wildebeast, ( we had seen only black before), jackals, giraffes and dozens of birds.







The zebras look different here too, they are more White than black!







It was the first time we had seen springbok and they look just like thompsons gazelles from a distance, but closer they are much scrawnier in their limbs and faces and a little lighter in colour. Oh, and their springing!







We saw a springbok with a baby and geez it was skinny and scrawny, disappearing camouflaged into the undergrowth in an instant! And then we saw another springing!!!! It was so cool!! They actually do spring!!





There were several lone spotted hyenas skulking around; I think those animals look so cool!







And It was hilarious to see a tiny jackal chasing an impala, and then the reverse! It was like nature going crazy!!







And then we saw the highlight of the day - the gorgeous oryx or gemsbok - the first ones we had seen! They are beautiful animals with stunning White faces crossed with black and long horns that must be really inconvenient sitting straight up. We also found out they can increase their body temperature to 40 &apos;C in order to survive in harsh weather and surroundings.







Suddenly the rains came in and we had to hightail it back to be inside the camp before the gates closed, our lovely cook Ben had a Mexican bean sauce, pasta and coleslaw waiting for us and we enjoyed hot showers! What a treat!







The campsite had a floodlit watering hole down the bottom of a long boardwalk and we could sit on covered benches there and watch the park at night! The seats were about 5m from a low wooden fence about a metre and a bit high, and thankfully there were some wires running across the top of it, but we were told to be aware at all times and we could see why.... I don&apos;t see that fence stopping anything intent on getting to us!!!!







We listened to the chorus of dozens of frogs, various splashes in the water and the highlight of my night, a banded mongoose ran along the fence right in front of us!







Lying in our tents that night we could hear lions and hyenas!!! There were also banded mongoose in the campsite, and we were told not to leave our shoes outside or the jackals would steal them!



Day 43, 44
 
Safari!!! Etosha National Park to Etosha Safari Camp, Namibia

2011-01-04

Yay! A break in the rain to pack down our tent as we grabbed breakfast and headed down to the Waterhole to see what was going on. A wildebeest was right there next to the fence, but as I approached him, he looked at me. I kind of paused and randomly waved hello. He did not like that at all as he bolted out of there! Doh! I had scared away the only animal at the hole!







Onto the truck we navigated the quite deep rain flooded paths that covered the entire truck with mud as we embarked on our game drive day.







Immediately we saw a herd of Zebra&apos;s and an injured mother protecting an injured baby on the ground. It must have had a broken back or broken hind legs as we watched and tried to figure out what had happened. The baby was covered in blood and kept trying to stand up, to no avail; just its top half lifting off the ground. The mother had injured legs and kept watch over him. As we sat there, a male zebra came up and attacked the baby, jumping on it as the mother engaged in a kicking fight trying to protect it. She fought the male off, but not before a few hard kicks had caught the baby and broken its front legs. The mother too did not escape unscathed, her legs injured further and limping more. The baby lay still for a while, and then tried to get up, but this time only its head lifting off the ground. It had become clear though - the baby had not been attacked by a predator, it was being killed by the herd as it must have been a male who would be a threat to them.







Next was a New born wildebeast! So fresh the mother still had the umbilical cord hanging out. The baby learnt quick though, soon it was on its feet and kind of gangly uncoordinated baby running in circles confused! The wildebeest all have their babies at the same time as it increases their chances of survival.







And then they came en mass! Giraffe, black backed jackal, springbox, oryx, ostrich, zebra, ostrich, red hartebeest, little steenboks, turtles and lots of birds! We could also see Flamingoes, but these ones were black, not pink as their water was plain and not a soda lake.







Suddenly we saw a flash of golden fur to our right and there running away was a Caracal and 2 cubs! A very very rare sighting, a caracal is a lynx like cat! Cool!!







Etosha is Namibia&apos;s premier game reserve, covering over 20 000 sq km and situated around the Etosha pan. The Etosha pan is still being speculated - it is either a dried up lake or deflation hollow covering 4730km, which is 21% of the total park area. We spent most of the day driving alongside it, looked at fresh individual tracks where you could make out footprints, and then lines where animals such as wildebeest had walked through following the exact same path. It was quite pretty joining the horizon with the blue sky, and went on forever as we stopped at a lookout point for photos. When we jumped the fence and starting walking on it, it was a hard crust of cracked dried mud and that super squishy and sticky below, like some kind of clay or face mask. A nightmare to get off our shoes that is for sure!







The animals in Etosha used to do a great migration like the one between the Serengeti and Masai Mara in Tanzania and Kenya, but with the division of land between countries and subsequent fences and development mean that the animals are now contained in places like Etosha. To counteract the fact that there is no water year round (part of the reason for the migration), water is now pumped in to man made waterholes throughout the park.







We stopped for lunch at an awesome campsite called Halai. Halai is a round horn ( like from the middle ages) used to signal the start and end of hunting season, but hunting season no longer exists! It had lots of shelters, bathrooms, a store, swimming pool and waterhole were you could sit on high seating and watch the action just maybe 10m below. We saw two male and a female reedbuck and a turtle whilst we were there.







It was awesome fun driving theough and spotting animals hiding everywhere, again to use my analagy, &apos;wheres wally&apos; style! We drove over 150km east to west on the southern part of the pan through the park and unfortunately had a massive rainstorm... Again! And a massive dry spell in the middle with no game to see, we were pretty ready to head out when our 24 hours in the park was up. We did see a few huge herds of giraffe and a massive herd of about 120 springbok just hanging around as we drove out!







Our campsite, Etosha Safari Lodge, was just down the road as another break in the rain allowed us to get our tents up, explore the super cool campsite, awesome olden day theme decked out bar (hmm &apos;whites only&apos; signs though. A bit too confronting!), restaurant, shop, reception and pool; have a rice and stirfry veg feast for dinner as well as time to sit around chatting after our first full meal and wash up in the light before the rain descended again.







So glad just to have even just patches of sunshine, and so glad to have longer days and more light! We had gone from darkness at 6:30pm up north to about 8:30pm here. Such an awesome difference!
 
Surrounded by 17 wild cheetahs...Etosha Safari Camp To Cheetah park, Otjitotongwe, Namibia

2011-01-05

Shop stop, Outjo! It was a really cute little town, well set up, streets, gutters, facilities and with a good supermarket, Internet, amazing bakery, no one hassling you and everything you needed. I am definitely looking forward to seeing more of Namibia!







The post office was still an ordeal though! Luckily we got there right on opening time and so were first in line. It took a good 15 minutes and a queue of about 10 not so impressed people behind us to buy stamps for 3 cards and 2 postcards. Good old African customer service we have come to know and hate! :) In the end after deciding that the U.A.E. was the same place as the USA, sticking 6 massive stamps on each, not having enough stamps for the postcards and the price ranging from $57 to $32 Namibian dollars and delivery expectancy of 3 1/2 weeks, I have taken photographic evidence that I sent your birthday cards Mum, Jas and Barrett as I doubt you will ever receive them!!!!







Thank goodness it was another short drive day as we arrived into the Cheetah Park at Otjitotongwe, set up in our awesome campsite, inventively named Cheetah Park! :) The campsite is part of a 7000 acre property currently used by the family to farm cattle and keep the cheetahs.







80% of Namibia is farmland and the local famers shoot the cheetahs to stop them killing their livestock. The Cheetah Park guys began to take them in to look after them and it has just evolved from there.







Just like a pet cat, the three &apos;domestic&apos; cheetahs, 2, 10 and 12 years old roamed free around the house, hung out with the pet dog and were in all sense of the word domestic cats.







We were picked up in the back of a ute and drove to the house, entering through the gate as the cheetahs walked around us and accompanied us to the backyard where we patted them, observed them and had some photos.







It was then feeding time! 3 big chunks of donkey -skin, hair, bones, everything still attached -were brought out and one thrown to each cheetah as they really quickly grabbed it and settled down to feast. It was so loud them feasting and crunching down on the cartiledge as we watched from just a metre or so away. They were really gnawing into it and we left them to it as we returned to camp.







About an hour later it was time to again pile into the back of the ute and head just a few minutes away through a gate to feed the 17 wild cheetahs they have in a large enclosure of sorts.  Immediately entering their area we watched 3 cheetahs slowly walking towards us. It was quite an eiree feeling to know these were wild cheetahs and we were just standing exposed on the back of a ute to a height they could easily jump to. And at 0- 110km/hr in just 4 seconds we would have no hope should one decide to act!!! ...And we had seen one just jump the fence at the house like that!







We drove around the path through the enclosure as more and more cheetahs came out of the bush to follow us until we had all 17 walking down the road at various distances behind the car. They all suddenly started to fan out and off to the right hand side suddenly a few started getting into a fight. Very soon the majority of them were all running to get involved and you could hear their chilling cries as they attacked each other in a massive ball of fighting. It was very bizarre to witness. The cheetah park boys sat watching, saying they had never seen any fighting of that scale before. When they finally broke up and came towards us, they started circling the car, which was kind of freaky as well. They all appeared to be okay, but one did have blood all  down its chest.







One cheetah that was hanging off to the left of the vehicle had one bright blue eye that he was blind in and it looked so eiree as he constantly stood there staring at us.







The cheetahs get fed everyday and we had a giant bin full of chunks of donkey meat that the staff took turns throwing out to either side of the vehicle. The first chunk was thrown up into the air and a few cheetah closest launched themselves into the air to catch it, a small tussle ensued and then the victorious one sprinted off to find a patch of grass to lie alone and devour his meat. We watched in amazement from the back of the ute as this continued until each cheetah had a piece of meat.







It was a very surreal experience watching it all unfold in front of us.







According to our trip itinerary, the purpose of our visit was to learn about the conservation of the cheetah population in Namibia. Yes.... well, I can definitely say I learnt nothing at all and left there confused about the places existence, but fairly sure they were just out to earn a quick tourist buck as they showed the group pictures of other African animals they had either shot or collected as meat for the cheetahs.





I tried to ask the cheetah park guys, the two 20 or 30 something guys  who worked there, the sons of the couple at the house with the pet cheetahs for information, but they didn&apos;t seem to know anything... One couldn&apos;t even identify the Leopard Tortoise we had found on the way back!







I finally got their website out of one of them - Www.cheetahparknamibia.com - and looked it up to see if I could gain any more information on what they were trying to achieve. But nope! The website had about 10 lines of information across the 5 different tabs, with such riveting summaries such as &apos; The farm is home to both wild and tame cheetahs. Guests can view the feeding of Cheetahs, ensuring supurb photographic oppoetunites.&apos; and yup, that is totally it!!! Nothing more!







I left still quite confused over why cheetahs, as lone animals were living in  a pack, in a fenced enclosure and I couldn&apos;t help thinking the fight we saw was testament as to why that shouldn&apos;t be the case.







We arrived home just in time for a Twilight swim before dinner. It was so perfect and relaxing swimming in the pool surrounded entirely by bush as we watched a little steenbok and guinea fowl walk past... Again we didn&apos;t want to leave!







After a braai ( the southern african word for a BBQ over coals) dinner with potatoes and veg, i climbed up the top of the wooden viewing tower and watched the Sunset over the hills behind us before we headed off to the bar.







The cute little thatched hut roof bar had some cool cheetah photos, giant elephant ears and trunk and was FULL of every type of bug immaginable. They flew around the lights, then into your head, body, arms, legs, down your shirt, up your shirts, and got into your hair... Nightmare!!!! Bern... You would have loved it! :)







The cheetah park guys, useless at information, but guns at trying to get the girls drunk, and playing pool. They  challenged our group to games of pool with the losers having to suffer a unique punishment. Donning a ww2 type steel helmet, they had to march around the pool table, being hit in the helmet by the victors pool cues. Finishing at a real stuffed Warthog head, buttocks and balls, they had to lick the balls, which a thousand other germ filled people before them had done, then stand there with their mouth open to receive a shot spraying out from the system they had rigged up inside the animals rear. Delightful!







Still unable to drink and tired from my malarial bout, i headed off to bed, and just in time as Of course the rains came in! But finally getting less intense! Yay! And then it was time to try to sleep, being woken by bugs that had made it back into the tent on hair and clothes.... Ahh Africa!
 
Rock paintings... 14 thousand million years old...&amp;the most beautiful sunsets in the world. Ch

2011-01-06

Rock paintings.... 14 thousand million years old..... And the most beautiful sunset in the world. Cheetah Park, Otjitotongwe to Spitzkoppe, Namibia







Cheetah Park campsite had an awesome wooden viewing platform and so I woke early to head over and watch the sun rise over the plains.







It was odd how the landscape suddenly changed from bush to total desert sparse, rocky, sandy desert; with a beating sun to match!







Along the way we saw lots of Herero ladies dressed from what looked like the 1900&apos;s, with layers of material in the dresses that came in at the waist and flared over the hips, and hats kind of like horns sitting in their heads made of matching material, to signify the cattle that they herded. The outfits are a throwback to German colonisation and they have never changed the way they dress. Apparantly also all they remove the bottom four teeth as a sign of respect to be like the cattle they admire so much.







We also saw some of the Himba people, who are often whom you think of when you think of traditional African tribes, nude but for a small kind of skirt like covering and the goats milk and dirt mix they cover themselves and hair with, called Orka..... according to our tour guide, but ochre according to the lonely planet guidebook! :) It is quite cool, the mixture is both an insect repellant and sunscreen as well as making them smell good!







We passed the highest mountain in Namibia, an extinct volcano that is the site for over 7000 rock paintings, including the famous &apos;white lady&apos; which early White Europeans identified a figure and labelled her as this, admidst massive contraversary.







We had our shop stop in Uis, a town consisting of pretty much nothing but a supermarket!







Our drive was like a Rollercoaster ride, and we speculated that Dinge, our driver had been a formula 1 racer or go cart rider in a previous life the way he drove. We were flying at speed over bumpy, bumpy dirt roads with dips and peaks and we had to actually hold on as we were bounced off our seats and half the truck looked distinctly green. Kind of fun at first, but definitely wore thin after a few hours!







As we neared our destination, we saw hundreds and hundreds of kytes circling above us. No idea why they were there, but it looked amazing, and something out of the horror film, &apos;The Birds&apos;.







From a distance out, we could see our campsite- the 1728m high rock formation, known as Spitzkoppe, rising out of the flat desert around it. Formed 130 million years ago when the continents were seperating and the world was awash with Volcanoc activity, it is spectacular!







We arrived into Spitzkoppe community camp, in the middle of the desert and absolutely the middle of nowhere to park up and attempt to escape the desert heat and burning sun. It was awesome!! A total bush camp away from anything and no facilities apart from a dug out toilet hidden by fly mesh and rock formations hundreds of metres high.  Hiding under the limited shade of trees, we then checked out the cave we were going to sleep in, just a few metres away, a concealed entrance that you ducked under and through a few rocks to enter and came out into a big cavern with an open &apos;ceiling&apos; through which you could see the beautiful blue sky, or at night, the stars.







Walking up the rock behind us, there was a natural rock pool filled with rainwater, local kids swimming and a fair portion of algae! It looked amazing though, a little oasis almost, a perfect view of the desert and massive rock  formations around us; and with the cool breeze and rock overhang creating a massive section of shade, it was paradise!







Peter, Nat and I had organised to go on a guided tour of the area at 4.... And about 20 past a teenager showed up. Dubiously we wondered if this was one of the &apos; 5 trained guides&apos; the site boasted, but soon realised he definitely wasn&apos;t as our 2 hour tour learning about the local area turned into a 20 min walk to &apos;Small Bushman Paradise&apos;, rock paintings. The &apos;guide&apos; didn&apos;t say a word as we then asked questions, he touched the paintings (!!!!!!!) as he told us they were 14 thousand million years old. Oh yes? So Before the earth even existed these paintings were here! Amazing! :)







The paintings were very old and faded ( and I still have no idea how old they are!) and depicted the activities of the local San people. We could make out the figures of people and various animals such as rhinocerous and cows or goats, but probably would have been a lot more interesting if we had been told something about it.







The tour over, we returned to camp, one last question asked just for confirmation... &apos;this area, the giant rock structures. How were they made?&apos; a pause. &apos;Earthquakes.&apos; Riiiiiight. Thanks. Not!







We then walked over to the natural rock bridge you could see from our camp, which was awesome fun climbing up it, but looking out for the various resident snakes, including the deadly black mambas, scorpions and spiders we knew to be lurking there.







And then it was off up to the top of the giant peak behind our camp for sunset! It was one giant rock and it was easy going at first walking up the slope of the side, but it soon came to rock climbing and hands and knees as we scraped our way bit by bit up, getting stuck at one point climbing the vertical rock and having to back down after fearing a massive slip and slide down the cheese grater like rock surface to our painful deaths!







We finally arrived on the summit! And it was absolutely stunning!!!!! We marvelled at the amazing 360 degree view around us and settled in to watch the sun set. It didn&apos;t seem to want to sink as we sat there an hour, trying not to freeze or get blown away by the massive wind that was ferociously stirring on top of the mountain.







Finally the sun began to turn into a ball and sink below the horizon. Again I am in the situation where it is impossible to describe how amazing it was to sit on top of a massive rock mountain, in the middle of the Namibian desert, no one around but us, and watch the amazing array of colours spread across the sky. It was exactly like a painting or a photograph you would admire, but say &apos;they must have touched it up, that can&apos;t be real!&apos; except it was, and we sat there stunned as the most beautiful colours covered the sky before unwillingly dragging ourselves away to attempt to get down safely before dark arrived!!!









We couldn&apos;t stop staring around us as we descended, taking care not to slip as we walked, climbed or crawled down the various sections to the bottom, never wanting to leave this amazing place!







We had chicken curry, veg and rice around our campfire before grabbing our mats, sleeping bags and insect repellant and heading to the cave to camp out under the stars.







The place was SO beautiful..... Or as Anica and i decided... the most marvelous, gorgeous, amazing, stunning, overwhelming and mind blowing sunsets and sunrises possible! Like those professional pictures you think are fake! Even if we do have to dodge black mambas, scorpians, barbed wire and electric fences... Worth it! :)
 
Streets! Traffic lights! Toilets! Beds!!!! .... Civilisation :) Spitzkoppe to Swakopmond, Namibia

2011-01-07 to 2011-01-09


After probably the most amazing sunset I have ever seen over the desert and rock formations of Spitzkoppe, Anica and I decided to get up nice and early to see the Sunrise!

The alarm went off and I crept quietly out of the cave to meet Anica and climb the rock behind our camp again.

Sitting in our chosen location we realised the sun was going to rise right behind the massive rock mountain in front of us! Doh! We decided to climb higher. In the dark we attempted to find the right routes, but at times ended grappling a little on our hands up the vertical bits! :) ...and then the view was no better! Back down without slipping was quite a mission, but we were soon safely down on ground level and powering out to get around that massive rock mountain before the colours started to rise! We decided it was a bit long around to the left and would shortcut over to the right....! Famous last words! :)

As always it started well, but very soon we were scrambling over giant boulders, around others, and ugh..... Under others! Treading heavily and making as much noise as we could to scare away potential snakes, spiders and scorpions!!! The area is home to the deadly black mambas!

And then... We pushed through the last spiderwebs and thorny trees and saw the most amazing pink, yellow, purple and orange colours lighting up the sky in front of us! Amazing! We rushed over to a large rock in front of us we could climb and sit on top as we watched the sun slowly rise over the desert. So beautiful!! Like a continuation of the sunset colours, but just in the opposite direction! Amazing!

It was a rush back to breakfast and back onto the truck. George had had a chat to Dinge, our driver about the crazy speeding driving and it was SO much nicer not being thrown around inside the back of the truck. He was pulling the piss though, driving at a snails pace down the sealed highway into town though. You can&apos;t win em all!

It was the bizarest feeling as we drove into town after spending a night in the bush, a night in the desert and we were now in a fully European town... And beachside! We had now also crossed the entire African continent as we had been swimming in the Indian Ocean on the east coast in Zanzibar, and now here we were in on the west in the Atlantic!

I touched the water... But i wasnt about to get in! It is so cold as the Benguela current sweeps upwards from Antarctica straight here! Brr!

Regardless of the water temperature, Swakopmond is Namibia&apos;s main beach resort; a little Germany inside Africa after it was founded in 1892 during the German colonial rule. The German influence is still evident in the shops, houses, food, names of everything and it was amazing to be back in civilisation. Streets! Gutters! Traffic lights!!! Shops! The ability to walk around without being harassed!! It was such a nice change!!!

We had an activity briefing on the adrenalin options available, but all too expensive, I decided to enjoy my time chilling out instead.

We checked into our hostel- Swakop Lodge or Gruner Kranz, (www.grunerkranz.com ) the first upgrade of our entire camping trip!!! How exciting!!! We excitedly entered our dorm room to find a tiny, tiny, tiny room with beds for 8 people jammed in, and literally no space between bunks to move - you had to breathe in and walk sideways to get between the beds!!

Definitely a world apart from the brochure showing modern, spacious beautiful rooms that&apos;s for sure! We didn&apos;t mind though, it was a cute little town, we had beds, toilets, power! Wifi! And the staff were all just so lovely, always happy and talkative, giving the guys free drinks, giving cushions when sitting on the floor using the net, it was lovely!

The first day I just kind of wandered around the really pretty, well laid out town, looked at the jetty, the beach, the (expensive) local markets, all the buildings, and checked out the stores. We also had a TV in our room and it was such a novelty to do something normal like see movies and TV shows we hadn&apos;t seen in a very long time!

As we settled down to go to bed we realised our nightmare had come true. The hostel was actually a nightclub. There were queues out the front, bouncers on the door, ID checks and everyone dressed up to impress. Great... Except we had to go through this to get to our rooms or use the communal bathrooms. Okay, strange, but no problem... Until you also realise the exceptionally loud music pumping out of your building goes until after 2am each morning, you can hear the screaming/ singing of patrons and you can feel the bass beating through your chest! So conducive to a good night sleep! :)

All in all, between the 8 people jammed into a room about 4m x 4m, the tiny window and therefore stifiling hot and stuffy rooms, as excited as we were about real accomodation, I think we all slept better in our tents!!

For some bizarre reason, each morning arrives with a cloudy Mist that takes several hours to burn off each morning. But, luckily for us, it rains about once every four years, so we were in heaven!

The shops all shut at 1pm on Sarurday for the entire weekend, with nothing but large supermarkets and restaurants open on Sundays. So old fashioned and cute! :)

It was D&apos;s birthday and so we walked around the shops for the morning and then headed out to look at the dunes after lunch. The city is pretty awesome in that it is set right in the middle of sand dunes. Apart from the sea front, Everywhere you look down the roads from the city you can see the White sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see.

We were all meeting to head to Neopolitana, a restaurant just down the road where we had the opportunity to eat (farmed versions of) the game that we had been seeing in the National Parks for the past few weeks! Anica and I shared a game grill so we could taste several meats. They were all super lean and very nice melt in your mouth meats, but different to eat.

We started with Springbok. Amazingly delicious! So lean, tender, a really nice texture and consistency, melt in your mouth, and sooooo tasty!!!

Next up was Kudu. It wasn&apos;t as well cooked, but again super lean, but the texture and consistency was a bit different and it had a stronger more distinct flavour.

Finally, the prettiest animal in the parks- the Oryx! Hmmm.... It again was not cooked as well, but it had a much different consistency and much stronger and distinct flavour... Kind of like liver. It definitely wasn&apos;t my cup of tea!

The verdict... Springbok!!! The hands down winner for the night!

Anica and D had make a vodka/gin/cane spirit watermelon, but by this stage D was already ridicuously drunk and the vomiting began. Oh yes, delightful! So much for an early nights sleep!

The malaria was still totally zapping me and although i was still taking it super easy, resting each day, going to bed early and not drinking, it was still a struggle to keep up as i spent the entire morning passed out.

I wandered around the totally dead town in the afternoon, with barely a car to be seen and no people, before I ended up on the other end of the beach. It was definitely like a seaside town down here with childrens playgrounds, bright multiple colour seats, ice cream stores, a promenade, beachfront cages and everyone down there enjoying the day! It was beautiful and a great atmosphere as I ran into Anica and Owen and we sat enjoying the day.

I had heard about a Tiger Reef beach bar at the far end of town right on the water, and so as the sun set I walked along the beach to arrive in perfect time to sit and watch the amazingly clear round fireball set over the horizon of the water. Beautiful!!!!! I enjoyed the pink, orange and purple colours spreading across the clear sky as hundreds of birds flew along the horizon and I watched the lights beginning to reflect in the water from the jetty. So lovely!

I ran into Peter, Hayley and George and enjoyed the last of the evening at the Tug restaurant, overlooking the jetty and water before heading home to listen to the endless music of the nightclub!

 
The Namib Desert. Even more beautiful then a Microsoft Screensaver. Swakopmond to Sesrium, Namibia

2011-01-10


The holiday was definitely over as the alarms again started going off before 5 so we could hit the road again.

The day started with a talking to by our tour leader Allan... So... Instead of doing the right thing and talking to our crew about small issues, they wanted us to stop telling them and go straight to the office. Riiight. Clearly not the best way of problem solving, but okay. Great!

And there we were speeding across the bumps, being bounced off our seats again! Less than a minute after leaving Swakopmond we were in the sand dunes, which was to be our vista for the rest of the day. Nothing but an endless road in front of us and sand dunes as far as the eye could see in every other direction.

We had a photo stop to see the immenseness of the area as we climbed a brown rocky formation and stared at the never ending expanse in front of us.

I&apos;m not sure what exactly i was expecting, but pulling up to the Tropic of Capricorn I was a little disappointed! Just the plain standard Government looking sign proclaiming &apos;Tropic of Capricorn&apos;. Previous passerby&apos;s had tried to create the Tropic&apos;s line and stemming out from one sign was a line created by people joining lots of the rocks up. The Tropic of Capricorn is significant as it is exactly 23.5&apos; south of the equator and at midday on the 21-24 Dec, the sun is directly above and casts no shadow, due to the rotation of the earth. During the star sign..... Capricorn! :) the constalation of the Capricorn goat plays some kind of significance here too, but they couldn&apos;t properly explain what!

We then stopped off in the tiny town of Solitare which was so cute! In the middle of nowhere, a petrol station, general store and bakery! It had a beautiful garden filled with flowering catci, and the bakery was famous for its chunky apple pie!

We crossed the Tsauchab River which is the one that feeds the Sesrium Canyon where we were heading.... Not much to see though, it was just maybe 15 metres wide and pretty much dry!

Continuining our sojourn into the middle of nowhere, we arrived at Sesrium camp to lunch and set up and be absolutely annilihated by the heat, the sun and then energy....zapped! We tried to regroup in the shade ready to head out on our exploration!

Piling onto the truck, our first stop was Sesriem Canyon, where thousands of years of erosion expose layers of rock deposited millions of years ago in the narrow gorge. It was interesting to see the conglomerate of rocks it was made of, periods of high water volume were dictated by large rocks being pushed along, and low water activity the sections of pebbles.

At the foot of the gorge, about 30-40 metres below ground pools form after the rains. It is a run off for the Tsauchab River we passed earlier - it formerly ran to the sea, but is now blocked by the dunes. We were pointed out the local Euphobia plants that are poisonous to touch and secrete a milky substance if you break it off. We heard a story of a Namibian soccer team who had used it as firewood on a campout years ago, the fumes silently killing the entire team in their sleep.

The gorge is said to be a popular hangout for scorpians, adders, black mambas and pythons, so we were kind of hoping to see one (from a distance!) but it was not to be today. It was nice and cool on the canyon floor, surrounded by the high rock Walls, but we were all sweaty, hot, dehydrated and ridiculously overheated by the time we exited.

And then...... The Namib desert! Although the campsite was right in the edge, it was only as we started driving through that the true realisation of the enormity of the area hit. One of the oldest and driest deserts in the world, extending across nearly 50 000 sq km, it also claims the highest sand dunes in the world - up to 300m high - at Sossusvlei. The dunes are shaped by the strong winds in varying directions that form an awesome looking collection of crests that simulate stars on the top.

It was a picture perfect Microsoft Screen Saver world as we passed dune after dune of perfect structure and red sand. There were a lot of desert plants growing out of a majority of them which I did not expect. We saw a few little dust whirly whirlies and then off to the dunes to the right, the wind blowing masses of dust along.

Arriving at the extent of the distance we could travel in our truck, we met the National Park rangers who we paid to take us in their 4x4 wheel drive safari cruisers out to Dead Vlai.

It was a hilarious ride over the sands holding on tight as we were bounced high into the air. We saw a couple of Oryx right next to us which was the closest we had been to them all trip!

Dropped off in the middle of nowhere we began hiking over the windswept red sand, being encompassed and dwarfed entirely by the dunes surrounding us. Right ahead was &apos;crazy dune&apos; one of the highest at 300m as we trekked a path around it!

We learnt quickly the easiest way to get through the desert is to follow and stand directly in someone elses foootsteps! A thousand times easierthan going it alone!

We crested a dune and right in front of us was Dead Vlai, a ghostly expanse of dried White clay, punctuated by skeletons of ancient camel- thorn trees. The Petrified trees sitting in the pan were about 800 years old and were a nice contrast against the blue of the sky, red of the dunes and White of the clay pan.

We enjoyed wandering around before we began melting in the sun and had to head back. The wind was starting to pick up and blow the sand towards us. Let&apos;s just say it looooooooves to stick to sunscreen as within minutes I had developed a sand &apos;tan&apos; as I was covered literally head to toe in the red sand sticking everywhere!

Back in our jeep, the next stop was Sossusvlei which was once connected to Dead Vlei, but has now been cut off by the shifting sands. The whole area was named this before the two Vleis were seperated and Dead Vlei renamed. Here water is still getting through underground and so there are living trees in the pan.

Another fun crazy 4 wheel drive back to our truck and we headed down to Dune 45. Dune 45 is so called as it is the 45th Dune and 45 km from the highway. Besides Crazy Dune, it is also the only other Dune open to climbers as the rest are protected by the National Parks Service.

Luckily by this stage it was after 5pm as the sun was still beating down incessantly on us and we may have died had we tried to climb any time earlier!

The Dune in front of us was 110-120m high, depending on the shifting of the sands and we started out with enthusiasm.... Which quickly waned. It was hard work!! Attempting to step in someones previous footsteps, it made no difference unless you were right behind them as the winds and sliding sand filled them up as quickly as they were made!

We were instructed to walk on the crest and it was really difficult work trying to keep balance and stay on the peak of the crest, stay in the footsteps in front of you, try not to lose balance with the immense wind coming directly across you and whipping up sand at a rate of knots straight into you! Oh, and not look down as it was a quite sheer angle straight down if you slipped!

It took forever, but eventually we made it to the summit of the first part of the dune. It continued on but we decided we had conquered! Sitting on the crest we were covered in sand as the wind tried valiently to blow us away. I must say the descent was definitely much easier!

Hot, exhausted, sick of the sun and covered in sand, we drove the 45km back from Dune 45 and entered our campsite to find it set up entirely differently from when we had left it... Hmm! Turned out the wind had picked up and blown the tents ( complete with our stuff inside) totally away! Those that had stayed at the campsite had chased them down, carried them back and placed them around the edge of the fence of our section of the campsite to keep them contained! Oh, yes, and complete with our own sand dunes inside now too!!! The wind was so strong, even with us inside it reduced the tent space by about a third as it crumpled the tent!

Our tour leader Alan told us stories of how the Campsite gets totally covered in sand and has to be dug out! Even just in the time that we were there, the wooden stumps that marked a fence line near the toilets were entirely buried!

Covered in sand and everything we owned equally as covered, we enjoyed real hot showers, for the first time in ages... Even if all the sand did block the drains and overflow them all!!! Oops! :)

I watched the sun set over the desert which was pretty, but nothing is ever going to compare to Spitzkoppe!

Our cook Ben had had difficulties cooking with all the sand and wind, so had fashioned wind breaks from the campsite wall and table to try and cook. It was a late late dinner as we sat around trying to stay awake, but worth it as we feasted on an amazing chicken and veg stirfry before collapsing Into the sandpits that were our tents!!

The stars and moon too were so bright and vibrant too in the clear desert sky. it was stunning!

The Namib desert is absolutely amazing. It has definitely turned into one of my favourite places. To be able to go out into it and experience the vast desolateness of one of the few places in the world like it was definitely something amazing that I will remember.

 
Sun, canyons and rivers. Sesriem to Fish River Canyon and Orange River, Namibia.

2011-01-11 to 2011-01-12


Another pre dawn pack up and departure as we watched a disappointing sunrise over the desert. Over 600km to travel today.... Of which less than 70 are sealed roads. The joy! :)

We saw a MASSIVE birds nest in a tree we passed by on the road, the small Social Weaver birds living together had created this woven nest several metres big hanging in a tree! Pretty cool!

We had stops is several cute little small towns with not much except a general store, including one called Bethanie, uwhere you can buy apparantly the best Biltong (an African jerky) there is.

After more hours being bounced off our seats, but now so used to it that we just hold on with one hand and can even read through it! We arrived at Cañon Roadhouse, literally again in the desert - nothing else as far as you could see. And it was so hot. SO hot! It again just zapped our energy as the sun beat down on us.

We set up and tried to cool down for a couple of hours. The campsite was quite cool... ancient cars, various different antique machines, signs and numberplates decked out the old converted farmhouse that was now the restaurant, bar, shop and reception! There was also a pretty little pool overlooking nothing but desolate desert.

At 6pm after weighing down the tent with rocks to stop it blowing away, we piled into the truck and headed to Fish River Canyon. 160km in length, up to 27km wide and a depth of 550m, it is apparantly the second largest canyon in the world, after The Grand Canyon.... But I am definitely going to have to google that as we have come up with several we think could challenge it!

We were dropped off at one end of a walking trail and made our way along rhe top of one side of the canyon. Unfortunately at the time it was, just before sunset, the sun was right in our line of vision and the canyon just looked a pale boring greyish brown.

It did definitely get more spectacular though as we continued around, seeing for the first time Fish River that weaves through the bottom, the layers of colours on the rocks and the various impressive rock formations down inside.

We arrived to the final lookout point perfectly on time for sunset as the giant ball of yellow quite quickly vanished behind the far canyon wall. It did at least light up the closest canyon walls in lovely red and orange shades that had previously been dull in the suns pre setting hues. Overall, quite nice, but nothing too impressive. We would all have much preferred the opportunity to see the canyon in all its glory, bathed in the colours of the sunshine earlier in the day.

The drive back to camp was more spectacular as the yellow glow on the horizon lit up the entirety of the features along it. The clouds too reflected a beautiful pinkish purple in the other direction.

It was dark by the time we returned to camp to have a late dinner of spaghetti bolognaise before we had the now common task of showering with head lamps (as the power was out), andcwhere the cold water was equally as hot as the hot tap from the desert sun, before getting into our tent and attempting to stop it blowing away!

Our campsite at Orange River in South Africa was flooded and so after just a few bumpy bumpy hours on the truck, we stayed an extra day in Namibia, on the other side of the river at our campsite Felix Unite (www.felixunite.com ).

It was just down the road from the border town of Noordoewer which sits astride the Orange River, (named after the Dutch monarch in the 1700&apos;s) and forms most of the boundary between Namibia and South Africa. Oh and the Fish River also conglomerates with this too!

The campsite was still being built, but we had a patch of greenery (yay, grass!!!!) to pitch our tents on..... ( But Not until after sunset though so it wouldnt be damaged!:) ) and a shelter to eat in, so we were happy! Exploring the campsite we found a beautiful pool and bar right overlooking the Orange River. The river really was ridicuously flooded as we looked at trees several metres in, the immense current and amount of debris floating in it. The river was also too full to be able to do any of the activities, such as canoeing, but we made the most of relaxing by the pool with the view for the afternoon. And watching the water level rise. It was not due to peak until Saturday, but already it was creeping up on the campsite. There was a line of trees in the middle of the river that was well under water and we heard they were normally on the bank!

 

And it was day 53! We were all kind if over it all, especially the long bumpy truck days and constant dehydration, and were desperately looking forward to arriving in Cape Town. Only 3 days to go! So exciting!

Pegging our tents in to try and escape the constant wind, we dined on a feast of rice, mashed pumpkin and beef or veg stew before I watched the sunset over the swollen Orange River. It is so nice having the opportunity to watch the sun set somewhere amazing and new each day!

And also watch Anica and Owen with their tent challenges. They had been racing against the clock setting their tent up in less than 2 minutes and putting it down in one and a half, so today it was blind tent erecting! Quite hilarious I&apos;m sure you can imagine!!

Luckily the Namibian dollar is also fixed to the rate of the South African Rand so we had been able to withdraw and use that throughout Namibia which made it easy wihout having to try and figure out how much we would need and get rid of the excess! Yay for not having a dozen currencies inside your wallet!!!

 
Broken truck.... Overland Hitch hiking! Orange River, Namibia to Cederberg, South Africa

2011-01-13


We were excitedly on our way this morning. After having to stay extra time in Namibia due to the Orange River flooding and us not being able to get to our campsite in South Africa, we were itching to get across!

It didn&apos;t take us long to get to the border and we calmly exited Namibia and bordered the truck to drive over the massive bridge across the Orange River that constituted No Mans Land.

The river was raging! According to Alan, our guide it was about 6m higher than he had ever seen it! One of the other border posts had already been closed down for the next two months because of it!

There were no forms to fill out on entry to South Africa which was a pleasant change and we lined up and progressed through.... before having our passports rechecked at a different window down the line and then filling in customs forms and returning to the first processing point! Hmm and it started out so efficiently promising!!!

But we were though...ish. Apparantly the central bearing in the truck had broken (no surprise really the way the driver thrashed the truck each day!) and we crawled along at a snails pace the few hundred metres to a border general store to wait out. And the news was not good. We were not going anywhere. A mechanic was being dispatched from Cape Town with the part and we were to stay at this one store dirt bowl for the night. Doh!!

As we contemplated our futures, another overland truck turned up. They looked fairly full, but we all stood there and joked about how amazing it would be if we could hitch a ride with them. Then, as we watched they all began moving and clearing up their stuff as we hardly dared breathe..... They were taking us out!!!!

Apparantly it was only luck that they were there at the same time as us. They were supposed to leave earlier this morning, but had all been so slow they were behind schedule and luckily for us it meant that we had run into them!!!

We grabbed our tents, sleeping bags, overnight bags and squished aboard, super excited to not be stuck at the border!!!

The African Trails truck was much different to ours. All the seats were facing inwards and there was roll down plastic sheeting instead of windows. They also only had one crew member to our three!!

We instantly began to regret not packing our jumpers as the wind rushed in the open sides and we began to get really cold!! It was a much smoother ride than our truck though so that was a nice change as we glided down the roads.

Our first stop was in the town of Springbok. As we got further and further into civilisation, we no longer just pulled over by the side of the road to go to the toilet, but stopped at actual picnic areas, service stations or towns. It was definitely a nice change!

As we did not have our kitchen from the truck we could not have a truck lunch and were given 30 Rand each to go into the supermarket or KFC to find lunch. It was quite a treat as although the food was good we were getting dead sick of having plain green salad and bread everyday!

Back on the truck we taught our new travelling companions truck games like &apos;the game&apos;, where we pair up into teams and by describing in the first round, one word in the second, and charades in the third, we had a minute to guess names of famous people we had put into a hat. We also played mafia and psychiatrist (where we took on different personalities of other members of the group... And Hayley, posing as me, in answer to a tricky question deemed me a &apos;compulsive hiker&apos;. We could not stop laughing! and before we knew it we were entering into the wine growing region and pulling into Highlander campsite (www.highlanderssa.com ). It was a beautiful area, surrounded by local wine farms that we admired as we pitched our tents on the lovely grass and walked up to the bar and pool with views over the whole area.

Sparky was our host, a lovely South African guy that lived there with his family and gave everyone a wine tasting of a range of award winning White, red, sparking pink, roset and vermouth from the Klawer Cellars, Birdfield wineries that they are affiliated with (not exported to Aus/NZ yet!) Although I couldn&apos;t drink because of the malaria a few weeks back, it was still lovely to sit on the balcony as we learnt about the wines, the Rooibois tea plantations on the mountain tops, and overlook all the vineyards.

Again as we didn&apos;t have our kitchen, our Cook Ben couldn&apos;t cook... We got to have a campsite meal!!! We were super excited as we had a traditional chicken Braai, the South African BBQ, with local gemsquash filled with creamed corn (delicious!), potato salad and the most amazingly delicious bread I have had!!! There was an amazing seed and grain bread, and..... A thick, dense, doughy bread that had been rolled flat, spread with brown onion soup powder, rolled into a loaf, squashed and baked. It was amazing!!!!

As we were using just one trucks gear for two trucks of people, there was not enough cutlery etc for everyone. The lucky first people which happened to be our group, got plates and knives and forks. The other guys ended up with bowls and spoons. As the icecream came out for dessert, we were in second and it was down to knives to eat it with!

It had quickly turned from a tragic to an amazingly great day and was definitely a delightful last night on our camping trip, as we were off to Cape town and a hostel in the morning!

 
We actually made it!!!! CAPE TOWN! South Africa

2011-01-14 to 2011-01-20

I will upload this as soon as i finish it! today or tomorrow! And same with the rest of them!! Can i still blame my malaria brain...? :-)





Africa...long, long bumpy drive days, but an unbelieveably stunning continent so much beautiful, unspoilt wilderness and so many amazing experiences that I hope future generations will also be able to enjoy. I think I had seen its best and its worst, but what a crazy adventure!
 
Goodbye Sunshine, Hello dreary English weather...but luxury! A real home!! Bicester, England

2011-01-21 to 2011-01-23

Dreary English Winter. I have not missed you!!! ....but luxury! Relaxing in a real home!! Bicester, England





My request for a aisle seat had clearly confused check-in as I ended up claustrophically in the middle of the middle row of seats between a tall and a chubby guy, both who encroached about an extra quarter over their allocated space.... Which for those that know me, I can assure you I made known, &apos;accidently&apos; kicking their legs which were in front of my chair, forcing mine to be squished into no space, and constantly going to my arm rests and having to have them move their arms so I could adjust my tv volume or chair recline. I hate it when fat or big people think they are entitled to your space cause you are smaller! And then my pillow vanished...! Argh! Last straw! Ready to get off now!!





Luckily there wasn&apos;t the crazy turbulance of earlier, but there was a delightful &apos;thwack!&apos; into the runway and we were here! Back to good ol&apos; England!





A sour faced immigration official was threatening the guy in front of me to have him seated with about six others in the waiting area if he laughed again, and then it was my turn for the condascending Spanish inquisition, required to provide proof of various documents and answer all manner of questions before my passport was literally thrown back towards me and i was free.





Brr it was cold! The walks to different areas of the airport along cold corridors gave a nasty teaser to what was waiting outside as I sat in a coffee shop and relaxed for an hour or so before hitting the tube to Marylebone station. Ahhh London.... I had forgotten how much I hated tube stops without escalators.... Just hundreds of stairs in a crush of dozens of rush hour commuters.





Still it was a nice feeling to be back in the buzz of London town, see all the familiar sights around you, know where you were and feel safe and secure again! Something I hadn&apos;t really felt since arriving in Africa three months ago. There was always that general feeling of unease that you knew something really bad could just happen.







The ability to walk around without clutching my belongings to you was a lovely, if foreign feeling concept as my heat still jumped and I looked around as I felt fast footsteps behind me. I guess it takes a while to wear off!!! :)





I somehow conveniently timed it just right to make the train and met Hels Bels at Bicester North where she had sweetly offered to pick me up after work.





And wow!!! It was SO cold! My breath froze as I tried to breathe the freezing air into my lungs and stop my extremities freezing. I had also watched the sun set several hours ago about 4pm  so i had the chilly darkness enveloping. Bring back the sunshine!!!







It was so lovely to see Helen. Hels Bels was my lacrosse coach both at high school and on outside as well as all time amazing person, teaching me to drive, hang out, and taking me on lacrosse roadtrips interstate or to Nationals.





Unfortunately after high school I moved away to uni and she moved back home to England. She now lives with her lovely husband Luke and gorgeous little girl Cate in the beautiful english countryside.





I was taken inside their lovely warm home, immediately treated to an amazing relaxing candlelit bath, and a real towel!!!! - that is definitely one of the things I miss the most! :) and as I washed days of travelling grime off, a delicious dinner Hels had prepared magically appeared. And she is 6 months pregnant! Yup, still as equally amazing as ever!





Cate and Luke arrived home and we had a lovely night chillaxing. So nice! And more of the same the next day, it was exactly what I needed and with such good company made it even nicer.







That afternoon we realised time had somehow escaped us and in the space of about two minutes... Well, maybe just a little more! :) had made and packed lunch, made a cupcake icing and decorating production line and were in the car on the way to lacrosse!







Helen coaches at Stowe School, A residence originally made for the Duke of Buckingham (www.stowe.co.uk ) and it was easily one of the most stunning places I had seen! My jaw dropped as we pulled up to the lacroose pitches, in front of a massive lake, stone arches and beautiful old buildings out in the distance, and a MASSIVE stuning old stone building complete with dozens of stairs to the entry, beautiful columns and lions! Yup, even big stone lions!





It was ridiculously frosty out, but I had to see what else was there! And I was not disappointed, everywhere I turned there were beautiful fields, lakes, stone carvings, stunning buildings, water, old churches, rotundas, monoleiths, you name it! I couldn&apos;t believe it as I walked across a bridge over the river and it stretched as far as the eye could see. Unbelieveable!!!





But not just that either... Amazing facilities too! Swimming pool, gym, full athletics track, music rooms...! A large percentage of the kids board there and get to live it everyday!! They also don&apos;t have local or Saturday sporting teams, they all are organised through and compete for their schools!





We headed up the massive stairs inside and had a delightful Afternoon tea in the dining room inside the main building which was amazing!





It was unbelieveable and just so far removed from our school upbringing back in Oz! Such totally different ideas of the word &apos;normal&apos; between the countries!! What a crazy, amazing historic link they have and it is awesome they keep continuing the traditions. Kids go to schools that their parents went to and as they are quite selective and expensive, network and make all their links there for when they head out into the big wide world. You can really see how the &apos;old boys network&apos; exists!





After another delicious home cooked dinner, I was totally shattered and absolutely crashed. The next morning I was still totally shattered... damn malaria!! But was lucky enough to be able to just chillax on the couch and recover.





We took a drive out to nearby Grove hill, Helen and Luke&apos;s farm which was awesome. A world of total nature, full of natural fields, trees, foxes and bees from where they make their own honey. It is a really cool retreat and I look forward to visiting in a few years when they are all set up there!!





I spend so much time in London I forget how beautiful the english countryside is and how easy it is to get out there!





I had not eaten so well in as long as i could remember as Hels and Luke prepared a delicious roast for lunch as I was treated to another amazing home cooked meal. I am sure going to miss this!!





But alas it was time to bring on the inevitable return to London as we bid our farewells and we made the train with seconds to spare! Ahhh!
 
Africa, it&apos;s been epic...

2011-01-21

I think I have seen your very best and very worst. But, one thing is for sure, you are certainly an amazing, beautifully stunning and diverse continent.





I think sometimes it is difficult not to become blase about where I am, what i have seen or what I are doing, But all it takes is one person to say something or a quiet moment when I get to sit back and reflect and I realise how incredibly lucky I have been to have the opportunities I have had and see the most amazing things i have seen, that some people will never get to, or may dream their whole lives about.





It has been a crazy adventure and I will do a bit of a sum up of some big points I wanted to write about.





Firstly, to look at the positives of you, my dear friend Malaria, which screws up your head so badly you perpetually forget things.... Instead i guess you can say everything is a constant surprise. Things that had been missing were constantly turning up when I least expected them after I had totally forgotten where I had put them and written them off as gone forever! Laugh or cry I guess!! :)





Not so nice though was the fact after so long being constantly vigilent and scared, my nerves were entirely shot to pieces. Arriving back in London safely, I definitely felt a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. But, I heard people suddenly start running behind me and I would immediately grab my bag and duck out the way.  I am also still constantly on guard, but I am really trying to relax and chill out!





That said... Africa, I never want you to change. I want the amazing pristine environments, total wilderness, wild animals and amazing cultures to be around for generations to come.... But..... Unfortunately, long term, there are just some things I just could not get used to! -





Hand washing clothes that never ever get clean

Everything always sweaty, dusty, sunscreeny and covered in mosquito repellant

Cold showers, often with a hose like head....

Except when it is super hot, then there is only hot water :)

Squat toilets

No toilets

No toilet paper

Leaking Tents

Bananas, bananas, bananas!!!

Only Bananas!!

Long and Bumpy roads

Burning, burning Sunshine and constant heat!

Bargaining. For everything.

Touts. Everywhere.

The phrase - &apos;give me money&apos;, on constant repeat

Everyone wanting something from you

Deet. Especially when it accidently gets into your eyes, or mouth or somehow onto your food! Mmmm mm!

Sunscreen. Constantly.

Sleeping mat and sleeping bag

Putting down tents in the rain

Putting up tents in the crazy desert sun

Sand. Everywhere

Thiefs

Muggers

Armed robbers

Breaking down trucks/ buses

No electricity

Showering with head torches

Checking for scorpians

Lack of adequate medical care

Doxy...

Doxy sunburn.... Doxy dreams.... Doxy nausea!

And of course... My personal favourite... Malaria! :)





And things that will never be able to be experienced again -

Gorilla trekking - fees are doubling next year from $500 to $1000USD.

Full day White water rafting on the Nile in Jinja will no longer be possible as a dam is being built across it.





But Africa had a lot of amazing points which I guess are easily overshadowed. I definitely love their sense of community and everyone looking out for each other in it. And also, Especially considering the hardships and difficult lives that so many people have endured they are still so smiley, happy, friendly and I am sure outside of big cities, very welcomming.





And Africa... Thanks for the memories. I will definitely miss your music and beautiful summer! :)
 
And the visa expires...Farewell London, Thanks for the Good Times.

2011-01-24 to 2011-02-02

Well, if we really want to be technical about it, I probably should have been out of here a little bit before now... but alls well that ends well! :-)
 
Off to Canada to meet Chuck the lumberjack!

2011-02-03 to 2011-02-16

When I first told my family about my grand plans to head off traveling my dear cousin Don just shook his head and informed me that I would be coming back engaged. &apos;Chuck&apos; was the poor fellow who this &apos;honour&apos; was bestowed upon and as the story grew, it turned out I would be living in a trailer park in the USA with 14 children and no doubt a &apos;fag&apos; hanging out the corner of Chuck&apos;s mouth!



I have recounted this story to various people en route and it just keeps getting bigger and better. Last count, thanks to my good friend Hels Bels, Chuck was a Canuck, or Canadian lumberjack. In my version he was a millionaire and would whisk me off to the South African Vineyards to get married, but I guess that remains to be seen.



Vancouver here I come!! :-)
 
The move to Canada!!!

2011-02-03 to 2011-02-05

It had arrived! After very little sleep... Compared to my current 15 hours that is! Today appeared to be the day of smart decisions. Not!





Although I had previously looked up the transport timings, my malaria brain had absolutely NO idea what they were. I held a brief discussion with myself and determined I needed to get up at 0430 to leave the house at 5, bus half an hour, train an hour, transit time between each and be at the airport in perfect timing!





Note to self- it does not take half an hour to get ready at ungodly hours of the morning. It takes over an hour.





I guess it did not help that in my infinite wisdom i had decided that i would use my mum&apos;s Christmas money to buy some 3/4 brown leather boots that I saw on sale....... And then left packing them in til the morning!





Note to self- it is impossible to fit another pair of large shoes into an already ridiculously overfull backpack.... That didn&apos;t fit everything I already had.





No amount of squishing could achieve this aim and as I sat down to catch my breath from this crazy early morning workout, I remembered I had already broken the bottom zipper several months ago and consequently had to gaffa tape it closed each time I flew (?) fly (?)! So.... With the assistance of a plastic bag to act as the new side of my backpack, I extended the backpack by a good 20cm, gaffa taped it all together and perfecto! Problem solved! I just needed that to hold for a few more hours...!





Although I was heading straight onto transport, indoors and then onto the plane, I cleverly decided to wear thermals, long sleeve top, t shirt, scarf, beanie, gloves, fleece and jacket - as per a normal London day. Probably more to do with the fact that they didn&apos;t fit in my bag more than anything!





Layered like the michellin man, I shouldered my load and began sweating my way out. Heading to the designated bus stop the station attendant pointed out I found no buses to my destination, Clapham Junction. Luckily the information in London is pretty efficient and I had pinpointed the correct location and was there in just a few minutes. Except that bus didn&apos;t start for another hour. Awesome! Back into the tube, I navigated the stairs, jumped aboard, off the next stop, up the stairs and to another bus stop.





Success. Except my oyster card was now out of money! Doh! Luckily this was one of the buses that accepted money and I could proceed. Arriving at The station, I had somehow impossibly made up about 20 mins! Nice!





The train arrived just minutes after I, and turns out it was just half an hour ride, as I made it to the airport right on schedule! I have no idea how that managed to work out so well, but brilliant! :)





I was flying Air Transat, an airline I had never heard of, but as per my usual requirements, were the cheapest!





Baggage was limited to 23kg underneath and 5 kg on top, which is loads really, except if you are a hoarder who sucks at packing and most of your life is in those bags!





Luckily my backpack was too wide to fit properly on the scales and so I managed to wedge it so the sides took part of the weight. Ahhhh way under! :) I was just glad she didn&apos;t try and pick it up! Same trick with the carry on.... 5 kg limit... Almost 10 was reduced to just under 6. Welcome aboard! :)





The flight was surprisngly good and I immediately checked for entertainment units! Score! And happily settled in to enjoy the ten hour flight. Usually I love flying, but I think after leaving Africa I was over it in about the first hour. Yup, definitely time to stop for a while!





I had to laugh when the pilot came on - an English guy by the name of Daniel Parker, the same name as one of my good friends back in the UK.





I attempted to while away the time, but the cabin was like a sauna as we all sat there sweating out the toxins  and dehydrating for ten hours. Delightful!





We arrived into Vancouver about 1130am local time.. And about 1930h, London time. Loooooooooooong day! And it was still going!!





The public transport was so easy! I headed straight out onto the skytrain, which arrived in just a few minutes, and paid an extra $5 on top of the usual zone fare for heading out of the airport. The &apos;welcome tax&apos; the volunteer at the airport told me laughing!





Out and heading straight for the bus, i pulled my map out and immediately someone came up to me, asked if they could help and pointed me in the right direction. So friendly!





With the same ticket for the skytrain and the bus, it was so easy as i jumped right on and headed straight out to Park Royal, a mall downtown to meet up with a Topdeck friend, Brook, who had arrived last month and was kindly having me stay for a few days.





Although it was cold, grey and wet it wasn&apos;t nearly as depressing or bone chilling as in London. I was already getting excited to be here.





And It was so friendly! As i walked around people smiled and said hello, spoke to you and were so happy. Even the bus drivers!!! It was amazing! I already love it!!! Canada where have you been all my life?!?!!





Looking around it also had a totally different vibe, just kind of laid back and relaxed. There wern&apos;t people pushing past you and rushing down the street, and it already seemed like a much more chillaxed people. There wasn&apos;t the stuffy style of London, there were people in rainjackets, outdoor jackets, not just coats; and gumboots, hiking boots, whatever was actually practical! My kind of place!





Waiting for Brook to finish work, i wandered around the mall looking at the Watermelons, which were the same size as rockmelons and found out people seemed to have some difficulty

understanding me- asking for frozen yoghurt, I was told they didn&apos;t sell fries. Great. Thanks!





The supermarkets in Park Royal were amazing. An Asian one called Osaka especially... Full of fresh fruit, veg, seafood, baked goods, piping hot fresh dumplings, pork buns, stir fries, fresh sushi... Anything you want!! And so delicious, reasonable and amazing!!!!  Mmmmm real asian food! I definitely have missed that being in Europe!!!





And then I found out about the tax...! So, most countries I have been to, this is included in the final price you see. But not Canada! Here if something is priced $40 you then get to the checkout and find it costs almost $50 with tax! Yup, just have $5 in your wallet? Can&apos;t buy something for 5! You have to do the math and work it iut before you get to the register so you have enough to purchase it!!! so annoying!!! Why can&apos;t it just be included!!!





Even worse for restaurants- you decide to get something that costs say, $10, then the bill comes with 12% tax and 15% service charge!! Nasty!!!





I then trudged around to get a new sim card for my phone. But... My dodgy Ethiopian phone didn&apos;t work here and I had to buy a new one. doh! And these things aren&apos;t cheap here!!! Most of them have some kind of weird internal SIM too so you cant swap SIMs around. Doh!!! I went from store to store, but found nothing reasonable as all the phones are locked to a network, you can only buy a phone that is from the network you wish to join. Argh!





So I then had to investigate all the providers to find what was best for me. Luckily Brook had already been through it so she was able to offer sone advice! You have to pay for both incoming and outgoing calls here so your credit gets chewed up like there is no tomorrow!!? No international calls and texts for the same price as local like Europe either!!! Doh!!! Such a crappy system!!!





Oh and plans are cheapest, but you can&apos;t go on one until you have a Canadian credit card... But you can&apos;t get one of those until you have had your debit card for six months. And it has to be a Canadian one! Love circles!! :)





Finally, just before my head exploded I got it sussed, and now have a new Fido phone and SIM. Back in the telecommunications world!





I met Brook and we headed to the place she and her boyfriend Ryan are house sitting... An amazing three story house in West Vancouver with a beautiful view across the water set to sell for a cool three million. So beautiful!!





I was so overtired by about 9pm local time, and It was about 5am London time by the time I finally got to bed. I was trying to get onto local time as quickly as possible.... But that still didn&apos;t stop me waking up at 4am. Or at 4am any subsequent morning!!! Argh!!! Damn these time differences!





The next day dawned sunshiney!!!! Yay!!! I got my back account sorted, where they just pulled a debit card out of a drawer and gave it to me to change the PIN and use it. They don&apos;t have your name or anything on them here! No waiting for it to arrive in the post! Now all I need is money for it...! :)





Canadians don&apos;t have visa debit like the rest of the world unfortunately, they only use credit cards, debit cards and cheque books. Yup, cheque books like back in the 1960&apos;s! :)





The bus system here too can only use coins on. You have to purchase your ticket from the machine as you board and there is no change! So, a one zone ticket is $2.50, but if you have have $3, too bad! And they don&apos;t accept notes, so if you don&apos;t have change, too bad, you are walking!!!





Like a pro I navigated the bus system out to get my Social Insurance Number (SIN), everything sorted!!





Ryan, Brook and I headed down to an amazingly delicious sushi restaurant at the local shops for dinner and it was so brilliant!! And they are everywhere! I definitely think I am going to like living here!!!





I jumped onto the bus again the next morning to head to a massive Op Shop, or thrift store as they call them here and found perfect interview clothes, some brand new, for just a few dollars. Score!! I checked out Capilano Mall and the amazing stores of Sears- cheap, but nice and quality stuff and the giant Walmart, complete with it&apos;s own McDonalds inside!!! Yup!!!





I had to laugh too as I walked around the aisles... Entire shelves of maple syrup. Every size you could possibly imagine and more! :)
 
Rellies! And turning down jobs, White Rock, B.C., Canada

2011-02-06 to 2011-02-12

My cousin Darrin had given me the name of a distant rellie, Brett, in Canada and I had contacted him to ask some advice. His family had so kindly offered to put me up whilst I sorted myself out and so I headed down to White Rock, about an hour south of Vancouver to stay.





So Barb (Weston, nee Lancaster) is the cousin of my Grandma (Thelma) and moved to Canada from New Zealand after marrying her husband Guy. Their daughter Kay and husband Elmer offered to take me in after I spoke to their son Brett! I hope that makes sense for the family to figure out! If you need more clarification, they are family five in the &apos;&apos;Blue Book&apos; (the family tree) and we are family eight!





It was quite easy to jump straight on the bus, skytrain and bus at the other end to be kindly picked up by Kay at the bus stop.





She took me on a tour of the cute little seaside town of White Rock (where all the family lived), which was really nice with the main street along the water and lots of cafes and little shops along it. It was quite deserted with the cold, windy weather but I can imagine how crowded it would be in summer!





The sand was a kind of grey brown pebble-y mix, and it was really pretty with a huge jetty out over the water. You could see just about ten mins or so away the border with the United States, marked by a giant White structure. I thought for days the entire family was calling it a &apos;pisage&apos;. It was only several days later when we drove by a hospital of the same name and I questioned what it actually meant did I find out that all along they were saying &apos;Peace Arch&apos;!!!





So as you looked at the ocean, the border was to the left. Across the other end of the peninsula to the right was a small section on the end of the land mass that also belonged to the USA. This meant kids growing up there had to drive all the way through Canada and back over the main US border to go to high school. Crazy!





We continued our tour, seeing all the amazing land on the water and river that had been reclaimed back and fenced off by the local native Indian population, and saw where the rest of the family lived.





We drove over to Kay&apos;s parents- Barb and Guy&apos;s - place where I was going to stay for the night. As it is on a little hill, the house has an awesome view over the water to the border and also of the mountains that ring the city. Beautiful!! We chatted over a delicious dinner, with Barb and Guy&apos;s other grandchild, Josh also coming to eat.





I was helping opening a tin of beans and had to laugh as their flavour was &apos;maple syrup&apos;, and yup, syrup on top of them inside the can. Only in Canada! They were delicious though!! :)





Unfortunately I was still waking up sometime around 4am and it was driving me insane!! I spent the day st Guy and Barbs before I headed off downtown for a job interview.





I was excited about the interview as I had only been in Canada for four days (everyone said it was really difficult to get a job here) and it involved fitness!





I had to leave about two hours before to head back into downtown Vancouver and to the location. It was the world kickboxing headquarters and I thought I had scored! Until I had the interview I had to use a keyboard to type a letter to an interesting kickboxing parent on the lite pro with the tiny screen over the opposite side of the room that I could barely see the letters on as they sat there and scrutinised me. One of the men was the guy that was on all the full size posters around the centre and called &apos;Master&apos;. So, I was then told that one was a human profiler and he decided to &apos;read&apos; me and tell me his conclusions about me. It went for quite a while, but in summary, I am honest, a hard worker but lacking in confidence. He then proceeded to tell me kickboxing would fix this all for me. He was quite close to me at the table and leaned in and told me to look him directly in the eyes and answer questions truthfully which was more than a little offputting as I was grilled as to whether I was &apos;an employee or entrepreneur&apos;, and whether I would stay long term or leave after they had taken the considerable time and money to train me up....





I was more than a little creeped out after I left, and this combined with the fact the job turned out to be an hour from downtown in a not so nice area made me definitely turn it down when I received the email the next day saying &apos;Congraduations (sic) and welcome to the family&apos;!!!



Murphy&apos;s Law between then and writing this I wasn&apos;t even contacted for another interview, letalone getting a job, but still totally happy with my decision!!!





As I walked around I was intrigued by the people. Not only were they all just so friendly and lovely and polite, I watched in amazement as everyone just automatically stood there queing in neat lines down the pavement whilst waiting for the bus. Even two neat rows back for entering at the middle door!





And then, people say thanks, talk to drivers, who in turn chat back and willingly help disabled and elderly people. And most of the time they actually stop and wait if they see you coming, not purposefully drive off London style!!





Kay kindly picked me up from the bus stop again as they were a fair way from it and took me to their amazing house on a big block of land surrounded by trees, and on a little hill so you had another awesome view of the mountains in the distance! I had an amazing bedroom on the top floor with a big bed and doona looking out directly over the mountains, it was brilliant!





The house was designed by Kay and Elmer and so well planned with a giant kitchen and always so warm! I loved it!
 
The life of an unemployed bum. Job hunting, house hunting. Job hunting, house hunting! Van, Canada

2011-02-10 to 2011-02-18

The jetlag was not going to leave me alone as again and again I woke at 4am, and slowly began waking at 5 and then 6. Needless to say I was ridiculously overtired and not on my best form as I pounded the pavement of downtown Vancouver resume dropping!





I have decided that looking for work is so bad for the environment as I single handely deforrested part of the Amazin printing out covering letters, resumes and job application forms to hand out.





And it was all pointless anyway! Places i resume dropped later loaded ads to craigslist and i had to reapply anyway! So annoying! The best i got out of it was volunteer work at the local yoga centre in exchange for free yoga. I was happy with that though!







House hunting was even worse. I scoured hundreds of listings online on craigslist each day, narrowed then down to ones suitable, near public transport and not too weird sounding, contacted the person and then the majority of the time never heard anything back! It was like some kind of popularity contest you had to win!





Some of the writers had ridiculously overactive immaginations too - &apos;large room&apos; was a mattress on the floor in a shared living, and you get the picture! Others advertised close to public transport, but after walking for 20 minutes from it, I gave up even bothering to see it! The majority of others were &apos;dens&apos; so under the main house and as dark and dingy as they come! Sometimes the people were just plain weird too. Others just made me laugh, titled things like &apos;attractive female wanted&apos; and you had to send in your stats with a photo to live with a 40 year old man or the like!!!





Another place i rang rold me not to bother seeing it as &apos;you sound too classy for this place&apos;. Tough times!!!





And then the scams! There were a few that sounded dodgy, and others that sounded perfectly normal, but then when the guy responded, I got an email saying he had been called away to England for work and would send the lease and keys just as soon as I sent him the security deposit and first months rent!! Dodgy!!





I found this website- (http://vancouvercondo.info/2008/03/beware-the-craigslist-rental-scam.html) that sums it up pretty well!



&quot;Hunting for rental housing in any city can be exhausting, in Vancouver it can be downright depressing. Going to view small dingy 1 bedroom apartments ‘accidentally’ listed as 2 bedrooms and described as ‘huge’ and ‘bright’ is a frustrating waste of time, but it would be even worse to lose deposit money to a scam listing of an apartment that doesn’t even exist.



Craigslist has brought a convenience to rental shopping that cuts both ways – It’s easier for you to look through listings in your bathrobe, but its also easier (and free!) for con-men and scammers to grab nice pictures off the web and list fake rentals that are too good to be true.



The Vancouver Police say at least 15 people in the last month have been conned out of deposit money in face to face meetings with fake landlords, but there’s no reason a scammer even needs to be in Vancouver if you’re not paying close attention. A common scam is to list an apartment that’s too good to be true, but the purported ‘owner’ happens to be out of the country, maybe just starting a new business in Athens Greece or on a missionary trip to Asia.&quot;









When I was over hunting, I hung out with Kay and Elmer, heading to Langley one day and on a tour of the area with Kay, walking down the amazing promenade at White Rock, heading out to dinner with Guy and Barb, shopping with Kay at the awesome,massive, massive supermarkets of Costco, Superstore, Walmart with everything you could possibly need and more!, cooked dinner, baked muffins and watched some amazing daytime tv.





Elmer introduced me to a show called &apos;Mantracker&apos; where &apos;mantracker&apos; hunts two human prey who are trying to evade him and get to the finish line without being caught. It was awesome  and Job interviews certainly were interfering with my avid watching of it! :)





I also had to laugh at the Sports guy on the news, he was quite a character, and there were random quotes coming up under the persons name that they were interviewing. Such as when talking about who should pay defense on the local ice hockey team, a player named most other people in the team, the quote comes up with  &apos;anyone but me&apos;!!!





It is also one year since the winter olympics were held here in Vancouver and there were several different activites to help celebrate. Unfortunately most of the street stalls, music, and activities were rained out, but the Canadians were all so proud, out in force in their red and White celebrating which was really cool. There is an iceskating rink right in the middle of the city I discovered too chocka block full of people!





Unfortunately the weather is a bit touch and go here, sometimes it rains and is freezing cold for an entire week, but then the sun comes out and you instantly forget about it with the amazing city totally ringed by stunning snow covered mountains.





The entire place is also sports mad about their local Ice Hockey team, the Vancouver Canucks and the world stops about three or four times a week as their games are televised live. Yup, live three or four times a week! I have to admit it is pretty cool though and I quite enjoy watching the games! They are currently top team too which is awesome, and have never won a premiership!





Canadians continue to amaze me with their friendliness as they talk to everyone, smile at you and help as soon as I stop and pull out a map! Well, with the exception of one Homeless person who yelled  &apos;come on you cheap c***&apos; when i didnt give him anything. yup, that&apos;s certainly going to make me give you money now!





The cement on the streets is also pretty, decorated with leaf imprints around trees and various different prints in different places you go. So nice!





I think i must attract television documentary crews at the moment after being interviewed in England before i left, and here, sitting in a city cafe waiting to meet Gerald, a friend of a friend, i once again found a camera pointed in my direction asking questions about a new barcode scanning system being implemented for discounts. I just had to scan it with my blackberry. Nope, don&apos;t have one of them! iPhone? Nope! Well, just take a picture of it with your phone for the camera then!!! Okay!





After an epic ordeal around in circles to find a phone that worked here, I had purchased pre-pay credit from Fido when I arrived in Canada with the promise of being easily able to change this to the more economical month by month plan once I had enough Canadian  identification. As the super system in place here eats your credit for both incoming and outgoing calls this credit was gone in no time. With no warning and not able to access this information in my phone I was about to head home as this happened. As I was unable to contact Kay and Elmer who I was staying with I needed to get this sorted out!! So Instead I had to backtrack and divert my route to the Fido store downtown. Waiting in line I finally got to see a service representative who spent ages deciding that they could not help me and told me I had to go and get a B.C. Identification card before I could get phone credit.... Even though I had already brought phone credit last week without this as had my friend Brook. Nope. So grumpily off I headed to the ICBC, a kind of roads and traffic agency where I got my number and waited 25 minutes to be served. Luckily as I had been job hunting i had all the required pieces of paperwork with me or I would have been really angry! I answered the questions, got my photo taken looking severely annoyed, got my confirmation paper and headed back to Fido. I again waited in queue to be told they couldn&apos;t help me and I would have to call customer service. Great. My phone won&apos;t work!!!! I finally got this through to them I had to use their phone and was put on hold. The phone was finally picked up by someone with a super thick accent who I could not understand and she could not understand me. She refused to continue the conversation as she could not prove it was me as I couldn&apos;t remember the postal code to my friends house. As I couldn&apos;t get Internet i finally flagged down someone in the store to look it up for me on google and then relayed it back to the girl on the phone. Right. So now she had verified this was me by me looking up a postal code on google, she told me the forms of ID I could use, SIN (social insurance number) card, passport etc. So I replied&apos;SIN card&apos;. She then started yelling, &apos;i said you have you have to use a SIN card...&apos; so I joined in . &apos;ISAID SIN CARD!!!!!&apos;. This entire exchange happened once more before it got through. I repeated the number four times before she got it down. We then moved on to the B.C. I.D. I had just been forced to get, where I was told that wasn&apos;t accepted. We had a massive argument and she refused to accept it and told me I had to use a Canadian passport only. I could not believe it and I&apos;ll spare you the details, but the ensuing argument was ridiculous. She went off the line for a while and then returned saying I could now use a Canadian drivers licence. At which point we were both practically screaming at each other as I again pointed out the reasons this was impossible. Yet, it was the same government issued identification as the BC ID and she refused to let me use that. Telling her I needed the manager... Now! She returned five minutes later saying I could use it. Argh! Another ten minutes trying to get her to get the numbers write and she then told me there was an error message on the system. Trying to get details she read it to me in French and then would not translate. Arggggggh! I was wildly gesturing to the store staff at this point and practically threw the phone to one girl that had helpfully looked up the postcode before. She took the phone, attempted to talk for five minutes and then just hung up, refusing to deal with her anymore after the person on the phone apparently told the girl in store it was her job, when it wasn&apos;t.





Luckily this girl was very helpful as she called customer service, and to cut a long story short because i am still too frustrated about the situation to waste any more time with it, she called customer service twice more before we finally got it achieved. I could not believe it. Two hours 26 minutes to get phone credit. That must be a new all time customer service low!!!!

The frustrations of setting up real life! Vancouver, Canada

2011-02-20 to 2011-02-23

For the first time in a ridiculously long time... (Almost 4 years!) I have my very own room to come gone to! My own bed, and my clothes are out of my backpack! Even more exciting I don&apos;t have to jam that thing closed every morning! Super exciting!





After being sick and tired of hunting through craigslist and spending all my time and money going downtown to look at places, I was tossing up between two.



The first was in Kitsilano, nearish to the beach and 2 blocks from a bus route, with no laundry and not available til March. It had awesome flat mates though which I regret not snapping up at the time!





The second was available now and had a laundry and right near a skytrain, so I took that one!





So my new place is in Yaletown, right in downtown Vancouver and really conveniently close to the skytrain public transport. It even has a mini gym and pool! Score! I have two Canadian flatmates - Bobby and Alanna, but also their partners live here as well.



My room is a solarium, i guess it is called - a tiled floor and floor to ceiling window and shoe box size! But enough space for a bed and cupboard and a bit of floor space left. So not much room.... but always space for visitors!! :-)





I was excited to get set up and so headed out to the nearest Walmart. It was massive!!!! Like the biggest warehouse you could possibly imagine, filled to the brim with every type of grocery, homewares, clothes, toiletries... Everything!!!





I was so excited I spent ages combing the aisles and seeing so many things I needed. It was also the first time I had had a fridge and kitchen to use in equally as long so all of the sudden I could finally buy all the things I had wanted to cook for so long! Hmm yes... Dangerous!





It wasn&apos;t so far to the wal-mart, but as I found out lugging 9 shopping bags, a pillow, comforter and sheet set it was not fun!!! My fingers were about to snap off from lack of circulation as I navigated my way several blocks to the skytrain, up 2 flights of stairs (thank goodness for the elevator!!) onto the skytrain, switch lines, another 2 levels, switch lines again - find out my usual route is closed and get lost finding the new way, almost board the skytrain in the wrong direction, make it back to Yaletown, walk home, exhausted - a five hour shopping spree!





So exhausted I was crashed out by 8! :)





The next day I was completing at St Johns First Aid Course as i needed it for the jobs i was applying for. Wow things have changed though in the 3 or 4 years since i did my last one! Crazy! So it was definitely good to refresh and learn. We used baby resusi annie dolls too which I don&apos;t remember doing before - so awful to have to resussitate a poor little baby!





I missed several phone calls whilst I was in the first aid training and when I rang them back the jobs were filled!! You have got to be quick around here!! :)





The funny thing was I have applied for so many jobs and they often don&apos;t write the company name on the advertisement. So they rang and say &apos;hi, it&apos;s blah here from blah blah about the job you applied for! And I am like &apos;oh hi, great! thanks for calling!&apos; but really have no idea who the company is or what the job is about!! I am getting really good at pretending though!!





It had been fairly mild, ( relatively speaking!) weather-wise, in the morning when I had arrived - just two winter coats on!! :) and locked in the classroom all day, I had no idea what the weather was doing outside. More of the same I presumed. But nope! I walked outside to be hit full on in the face by massive snowflakes as the ground was totally covered in snow! I couldn&apos;t believe it as I just stood there going &apos;oh my god, it&apos;s snowing!!!&apos; this lasted all of about 2 seconds before my fingers started to freeze and I got covered in snow before I rushed back indoors to get the umbrella. Crazy!!!





Luckily the weather was a little clamer back in downtown as I headed off to my first hot yoga class! (www.westcoasthotyoga.com) speaking to the lovely girl, Jessica, at reception a few days ago whilst resume dropping she had offered an exchange of yoga lessons for helping out to clean the studio afterwards! Awesome! And so I sweated like there was no tomorrow, then cleaned all the mirrors (there are heaps of them though! All around the studio Walls!), put some stuff away in the store room and done! Sweet!





After a long painful day learning bandaging techniques again, I was off to a couchsurfing meet! I had been to several of these before in Mexico City, Bergen, Norway, and London and they were always a fun night.





Now being so conveniently located downtown it was easy to hop on the skytrain and get there in no time. Finding other lost looking people we all sat down and had a great night as we exchanged stories of impossible job searches, nightmare house hunts, and heard the stories of extreme bed bugs overtaking the city. It was so good to hear that I wasn&apos;t the only one and everyone else too was having exactly the same depressing problems as together we had a good laugh about it all! There were people who had had enough and were leaving and others in their second month of looking for jobs and a place they liked to live in. I met some great people and left decidely much happier!





The next day I was busy with job interviews! I had my first at a gym in the commercial district a bus ride away, the next off to an adventure clothing retailer I had just done a resume drop of last week which was now advertised in craigslist, so time to harass them about what was going on, and then doing my third resume drop to this cool gym I really wanted to work at downtown. Yup, third for the one place! I wonder how many it will take for them to actually call me!!! The count is on! :)





It was then to a travel company helping to organise visas and jobs for 18-30 year olds overseas. They weren&apos;t picking up the phone to arrange an interview time so I just dropped in. Another lady was interviewing so I just joined in. Wow. She was 50 something and returning to the workforce and talked non stop about what an amazing place it was and how she was sooooo excited to work there that I couldn&apos;t get a word in edgeways. I was thinking surely it was driving the interviewer crazy, but he was just totally lapping it up! She had a resume and business card printed on nice paper and in a matching cream coloured folder, whilst I handed over my photocopied one telling him it was the &apos;budget version&apos;. The interviewer then asked about starting on Monday and would send an email out. He voluntarily shook her hand, but not mine until I then offered it. So I was like does that mean she got the job and I didn&apos;t? Or we both did? So weird!!!! No idea and a day later still awaiting this supposed email I am about to call him and give him a hard time to find out!!!





Up to downtown again for the final interview of the day turned out to be a call centre. I had always used that as my benchmark - &apos;at least I am not working in a call centre&apos; - but it was raising money for charity and money so I tried to change my judgement!! And I guess you can&apos;t judge until you try it! So I accepted a training day and start Monday to see what it is like!





Earlier in the day I had received an email from a company i had done a phone interview with several days ago to say I got gotten five days work at a trade show next week so that was exciting! The expert that I am in home renovations... Not!! :) I had tried to call back, but my phone just gave me a recorded message saying &apos;you are not authorised&apos;.





I headed back to my least favourite place in the world, the Fido store where I had spent two and a half hours last week attempting to get credit. And so the vicious cycle started again. The store said it was out of their hands. I had to call customer service. I was on hold for ten minutes and then they couldn&apos;t help. I was given another number, but it was out of office hours and the emergency number on their answering machine was missing a digit and therefore didn&apos;t work. Back to customer service. Another ten minute wait. My account had apparently not been set up properly and had been blocked by the fraud department. I had to fax proof of address and three different forms of I.D. To the fraud department. Luckily i had these all with me as i had just been to a job interview or i would have been even madder! The store had no photocopier so I had to walk five blocks to a copy store, pay, return to Fido. Convince them to fax it. Wait for it to go through. Wait for a useless, lazy, non helpful customer service rep to get customer service on the phone for me again. Wait fifteen minutes on hold. Finally get someone who I didn&apos;t have to yell at to get results. Get the actual right number for the fraud department. Wait on hold for ten minutes. FINALLY get someone who was actually still there and could help! So the idiot that had caused me so much pain last week when getting my phone credit had not done the account properly and therfore fraud had blocked it, but someone forgot to inform me as per procedures. Great. The guy found my fax, went through it, provisionally unblocked my account for local calls and said the rest would be assessed by my case manager in the morning! But success! Finally! And only just over two hours. I was so angry at Fido, they are so useless, incompetent, unhelpful and don&apos;t care at all! Whilst I was there I heard two other people coming up and complaining as well so it is definitely not an isolated case. Do not use them!! You will lose your sanity!!!! So by the time you count travel time, that is an entire day of my life Fido have now wasted. Yup, a nastygram coming their way! Stay tuned for updates! :)





So ready to end the day I headed home, to find a super grumpy carpet cleaner. Apparently my flatmates had never vacuumed the floor so he had called the owner who came over and went mad at me. I was like &apos;i just moved in!!!!!&apos; and then he is like &apos;who are you how come I don&apos;t know, blah blah blah!&apos; ahhhh! So I told him I would probably leave anyway and not to worry! Although I loved my house location, my flatmates were totally devoid of any type of personality. And after talking to other couchsurfers it seemed to be a common problem here! As my flatmates turned out to be living with their partners here they all just spent all the time in their rooms with the doors closed and didnt talk to me so it was very unfriendly and lonely and it felt like i was kind of tip toeing around their space. And they didn&apos;t clean! And there wasn&apos;t even a kettle, or any spoons besides teaspoons, or much else at all. And they had been here a year. One guy, bobby was friendly the rare times he was by himself, but his girlfriend literally couldn&apos;t even manage a hello. It had gone from amazing excitement to a depressing place to live in the space of a few short days as I attempted to avoid signing a lease and resumed the house hunt. Doh!!! The problem was it is a really good deal and I havnt found anything else downtown for a similar price so now need to weigh up moving outside of downtown for better people, but worse location, or just stay here and be out the whole time instead. Double Doh!
 
&apos;in a room full of sharks, we bring the bait&apos; and other random stories. Vancouver, Canada

2011-02-24 to 2011-03-02

There are SO many homeless people in the city here. Apparently it is as it is one of the warmest places in Canada so they can actually survive here. It us crazy! Some not so nice places I have had to catch a bus through, such as East Hastings, everywhere you look there are literally dozens!





There is a massive drug scene here too, and walking down the street or sitting on the bus you can just smell weed everywhere.... Or if you are super lucky watch people smoking, or shooting up in East Hastings. I had decided that that must have been the reason for my failure to get a job so far too... With my malaria induced black rings and bags under my eyes I just couldn&apos;t shake, I must have looked like some kind of druggy! :-)





I was struggling a bit with the weather - pulling on about 6 layers to leave the house, but it made me feel slightly better to hear that it was the Coldest day ever recorded in February, with a -12 overnight, I believe. Ahh, it made me Fondly remember the days I thought +15&apos;C was cold though!!!!!!





The next morning I woke up and opened the curtains to find snow! And not just the little ones that didn&apos;t stick, but big fluffy White ones covering everything! It was so cool! But so cold as I wrapped up in a thousand layers and braved the cold to meet Ryan, Brook and their friend Kirren for lunch.





There is amazing sushi here in Vancouver, and this amazing phonomena known as .... All you can eat sushi! They must be some of the greatest words ever uttered!





All you can eat sushi is one of THE things to do here. So much so, that Ryan, being a local shared the world famous Ryan &apos; guide to all you can eat sushi....&apos; A whole day activity, Beginning with a late wake up and a small snack to ensure your stomach doesn&apos;t shrink. Head in around 1pm and Consume copious amounts of delicious all you can eat sushi for about an hour and a half. Return home and spend the remainder of the afternoon in a sushi induced coma on the couch! The perfect day! :-)





We went to a place called &apos;Shabusen&apos; downtown and it was delicious! For only $13.50 (plus tax.... And tip.... Of course!) You can order as much delicious, amazing sushi and Mongolian BBQ meat to cook on the grill in front of you as you can eat! The catch to prevent wastage is that you have to pay for each piece leftover! Genius!





Besides sushi, i have discovered the other main &apos;local&apos; foods. The first is something called &apos;Pulled pork&apos; where the meat is slow roasted for hours and then shredded. Apparently it can then be used as or in anything! Pies, sandwiches, as a main!





The next is hot chips in a bowl covered with gravy and runny cheese curd. To be honest, it looks disgusting, but the locals rave about it, so will reserve judgement!





And finally.... Root Beer. A toxic dark coloured fizzy drink that smells like cough syrup. Yet the locals drink it for fun! Eeew.





I am yet to try any of these, but will keep you updated!





This week I was rostered on for my second shift of volunteer work at the yoga studio and this time was in a class by a guy who i came to know as Will Blunderfield (www.willblunderfield.com ) a local recording artist! It was quite cool too as he sang songs he was famous for through all the relaxation phases! So nice!





The snow continued overnight and I woke up to a picture perfect white Christmas scene! It was so pretty to look at... But not so pretty once I was actually outside and attempting to walk through the several inches of it! Between the rain and cars, it soon turned into a trecherous grey ankle deep arctic slush as I struggled to keep my footing or walk in places it didn&apos;t flow over my shoes!





I met Marieanne, an Irish girl I had met at the couchsurfing meeting the previous week and we caught the bus out to the public market on Granville Island. It was probably the nastiest day we could have chosen to go with the slush, rain and wind but we were determined to get out!





The markets were cool, lots of amazing fresh produce and delicious baked goods piled high; our mouths watering uncontrollably as we wandered around the various stands. They were really cool, but a little but smaller than I was expecting. Apparantly there was another craft market alongside though that we did not go into.





Catching the bus back, we jumped off at Waterfront to get a bite to eat, joining the rest of the Vanvouverites, hands out for balance on the slippery sidewalks and walking halfway across the road to avoid our feet becomming buried in the ankle deep arctic sludge, only to give up and kind of bound across it, hoping the less time in it, the less would soak through to our shoes.....And praying we didn&apos;t hit an icy bit to end up on our arses! And it was a success :-)





We had lunch at the waterfront food court and watched about a ten minute video on recycling! Canadians are very serious about this as it taught you to use all the different bins. Food scraps here, liquid here, wooden skewers and chopsticks, plastic cutlery, serviettes, plastic plates.... Nothing was missed!!!





For those that remember my previous posts, I was having trouble knowing what jobs on earth I had applied for on craigslist with the lack of detail in the postings and quite looked forward to getting new emails and phone calls each day to see what funny things would come of it!





Today was no exception! Picking up the phone I was asked who I was and if someone had rung me yesterday or today reference my application...  Guarded I waited for more information and was told it was the hostess position downtown. Yup, apply for them several times a day! Still none the wiser as I was asked if &apos;I was hot!&apos; I was torn between laughing and being shocked as the interwiewer went on to explain that I was the only person who had not sent in a racy photo of themselves and he was able to sort them from that! I laughed at this point thinking of the total polar opposite photo I supplied with my applications - me wearing about a thousand layers on top of Mt Kilimanjaro!





He went on to tell me it was &apos;not a gentlemans club&apos; but I would just greet and make polite conversation and make patrons feel welcome.





He had 300 applications and had picked 5. And it would be 90% looks, 10% personality as I struggled not to laugh. What on earth was this?!





I had to explain why I should be picked over the other girl (not even sure what I was being picked for!) and apparently he liked my accent and I was in! For what I had no idea, but I was most certainly going along for a laugh! These interviews just get weirder and weirder!!





But it was not to stop there as I got a request for a long term (20 year) paid commitment to a brain research study at the University of British Columbia, and then...





And then i was trapped on the phone for at least ten minutes by some guy trying to convince me that I had been selected to become a part of their brand new sport for females, a mix of wrestling and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). When I politely declined he started to interview me to become one of their promo girls!! Argh! How is &apos;no&apos; for you!





I am definitely going to have to be more selective on the jobs I apply for on craigslist, that is for sure... As entertaining as it is! :-)





But the days weird job interviews were not to end there as I received an email rquesting more close up photos of me and asking what my &apos;social networking ecperience&apos; was. Weird!!! I thought as I typed in the online sites I use, wondering what was to come next, as almost immediately an email bounced back from this company saying I had been selected for their training. Opening their website, I am still not sure what it entailed as the slogan is &apos;because there is Nothing more powerful than a beautiful woman with some serious smarts.&apos; and &apos;in a room full of sharks we bring the bait&apos;. Www.houseofascension.com or www.ascension-team.com if you want a laugh! but hey, another funny story to add to the collection I am sure!! :-)





I also forgot to mention I job interview I had last week where the guy looked through my resume, asked me questions and then told me I was &apos;really too much of a flight risk&apos; for long term employment. I had to laugh then.... Saying whatever I could really meant nothing when my resume depicted a new location each year!!





I had been on Craigslist (www.craigslist.ca) so many hours each day hunting through houses and jobs and free stuff that i was starting to have nightmares involving it! After this endeavour, if I ever see craigslist again it will be too soon!!





So, the job at Global Work and travel company turned out to be offered to me and I arrived Monday afternoon ready for a training session. The lady I had interviewed with was also there and she turned out to be much more normal and nice out of the interview setting. Altogether there was four of us, another nice girl and this totally up himself older guy who was there to push sales and commission for himself at all costs, regardless of the product or whether it was suitable for the person. When talking about australians doing overseas working holidays, he assuredly commented &apos;oh yes, all Australians go on a walkabout!&apos; A line straight from the movie Crocodile Dundee that cemented the fact he had no idea what he was talking about! I couldn&apos;t keep as straight face as I kind of turned away to see the sales boss turn and look at me with a face trying equally hard not to smirk! I knew at that time my boss would be okay!





The training went for probably an hour longer than it should have with Crocodile Dundee man putting his two cents in to everything he knew nothing about and I was glad although I would work alongside him, we would have nothing to do with each other as everyone else on the team seemed cool!





So I then decided to pass up a day of work just to see what on earth the &apos;ascension&apos; thing was all about. I was told to dress &apos;business sexy&apos;, and tried not to laugh as I ran down the road to buy some make up and put on one of my choice of two thrift store workoutfits!





I arrived at the required address and after wandering the block and not finding it, came across another girl who was looking for it. She rang the boss and we were told it was the wrong address and that she was waiting in a White Humvee outside to drive us there. Seven of us were piled into the massive vehicle and were driven a few blocks away as we jumped out across the traffic and ran inside. We headed up to a small conference room on the tenth floor where two gentlemen were waiting and we proceeded to have s severely disorganised &apos; chat&apos; or him talking to us, about the mining exchange in Vancouver where companies were going to be convinced that they wanted to hire us to be IRO&apos;s or Investor Relations Officers. It was way weird. We had to laugh too hard at bad jokes, smile and act interested in acronyms like &apos;CPC&apos; - Capital Pool Company, &apos;OTC&apos; - over the counter and hear about share structures. We did constantly get asked if we had any questions, but I was like I have no idea what this is!!!!





After about the randomest hour here kind of sitting around, we again piled into the Hummer to sit at a restaurant in Yaletown owned by one of the ascension members, ate subway, had photos taken of us and kind of debriefed with everyone saying how interesting and fun it was and how much they learnt. And then it came to my turn... I don&apos;t think she liked my opinion too much so i think i ruined my chances for a call back!! Not that I wanted to lose any more brain cells in there and sent a thanks, but no thanks to them. it was really interesting to see it in action, but SO not my scene to google and read about mining shares to not really understand it, but be able to wear boots and short skirts and &apos;schmooze&apos; (quote unquote!) to men!!!! Ahhh craigslist. Funny day!
 
Sales jobs, home shows and a new name. Vancouver, Canada

2011-03-02 to 2011-03-14

There is a good reason why sales jobs and I have never mixed before!



So, in the city with both the lowest minimum wage ($8..... Yup, $8!) and the highest unemployment in Canada I guess I should feel lucky that I have a job, but still, sitting in the office, two of us jammed onto one side of a desk, sharing a phone line which each of us, waiting impatiently for the other, need to be on constantly in order to call people to sign up for our program so we can make commission in order to earn money.  Sometimes I wonder!





The guy that works with me who I spoke about in a previous post sounds like a 1960&apos; s used car salesman and I just cringe everytime I hear him in action. Which, with our extreme proximity is about 99% of the day!!





I also had to field random calls from Nigerians trying to get me to get them sponsorship or a job or a visa or anything to get into the country! Sure, I feel for them, but keeping me on the phone for 15 minutes isn&apos;t going to help either of us!!





It was funny though, as everyone else I started with (five of us), left within a week, everyday I was asked if i was coming back tomorrow! I just laughed and said !hopefully not but until the next offer came through I was stuck!&apos;





For the first time in my life I don&apos;t have a uniform to wear! It is kind of weird waking up in the morning and deciding what to wear. Not that I really have much choice, seeing I have a grand total of three work type outfits - all from the thrift store! Hmm I wonder how long it will take for anybody to notice!!! :-)





So, in my first week of actual, proper work in four years, i cleverly decide to also take on an additional job in my off hours! As if being back in the workforce wasn&apos;t tiring, draining and disheartening enough, i raced from one job to the next at the end of the day!





My second job was just short term at the BC Home and Garden Show (www.      ) working for Homestars (www.homestars.com ) an online database where people go to write reviews on contractors so others can research before they choose someone.





Quite good idea really, but trying to tell this to people as they powered past our stand was a little tough. Even tougher was getting them in to sit down for literally just 5 mins to sign up and write a review on someone. I personally would have grabbed any opportunity to sit down, especially seeing as we were giving away $5 Starbucks or Tim Hortons (the other massive coffee chain here) for their trouble, but it was surprisingly challenging! No one had any time at all! Which, was a pain in the arse for me seeing as it seems to be the usual way I earnt commission on these submissions!





Our stand was right across the aisle from someone I refer to simply as &apos;the garlic guy&apos;. I am sure everyone has seen someone like this at trade shows or demonstrating in K-mart.





The problem was, I got to hear his demonstration three thousand times a day, every day! &apos;Do you have just 1 min and 47 seconds? Do you love garlic? Well, just roll it in here, instantly you have a peeled clove. Now hit it on this place and wallah! Garlic that spreads like butter, but without the butter! Perfect for putting on your steak before you BBQ or fish before you bake . Amazing!&apos; ARGH!!!!





By the end of the first night I was going so crazy and went up to him telling him I had heard his spiel so many times I knew it off by heart, he told me i could take over on Sunday and give him a break! Thanks, but no thanks! :)





For some random reason when I arrived into the country, the immigration officials had taken it upon themselves to give me a middle name.

Now legally I do not have one, and have never used one, and the paperwork the Canadian Government sent me to check over and confirm didn&apos;t have it on there. So sometime between me arriving in the country and her printing out my visa, folding it up, stapling it into my passport and giving it back to me enclosed, one arrived!





Now unsurprisingly this has caused me no end of problems as I now have the letters &apos;koschew&apos; between my first and last names. Realistically I think she read the paperwork wrong and placed several letters from my real last name in there, but no excuse for her stupidity!





So now each place I go to places that need to see my identification, type the name of my visa paperwork into their system - the bank, the British Columbia Identification Card, random places that need to see I.D. Never mind the fact the most legal document in the world - my passport - doesn&apos;t have this name, they don&apos;t think it weird, on the contrary they decide the Australian Government got my name wrong on my passport, I never bothered to fix it and the Canadian Government has managed to fix this and get it right instead. Wow hey!!!





It is kinda funny though that my legal initials in Canada are &apos;KKK&apos;! :)





The job that I am continuining to enjoy is doing volunteer work at my local yoga centre - the people are so lovely and the yoga classes are good fun.





Hot yoga is definitely an experience though! Although I am aware of their multitude of benefits, I had always thought of a lot of styles of yoga as a bit slow and boring. This on the otherhand adds a whole new dimension when you are in a sauna-esque atmosphere attempting some crazy holding core strength exercises or balance poses with the seat literally running off you!





I had the pleasure of catching up for a delicious Sushi Dinner with Keith and john, two Vancouverites who I climbed Mt Kilimanjaro with last year, and also meeting a heap of cool people at various Couchsurfing meets. That network is amazing for travellers- an instant group of friends wherever you go!





I also met a local girl, Stella, to attend a free dance performance at my local community centre, as a part of the Vancouver International Dance Festival.

We saw two different short performances - Snow and birds by Arts Umbrella Dance Company (AUDC). The first one was amazing!!! There was a boy and girl puppets to 2 guys moving them intertwined together! The choreography just was non stop amazingness! It totally blew my mind!





And then the Four Quartets by T.S. Eliot with dancing by Deborah Dunn against the words of the poem instead of music. Interesting interpretation, but I think music makes it for me!





I also met an ex Aussie military guy, Ryan, his girlfriend Christie and some of their friends at a stand up comedy final at Ceilis, a local Irish Pub. Some of them were awful as we sat there being glad we didn&apos;t have to sit through the heats if this was the best of them! A couple were awesome and the professional guy, Who finished it off was brilliant!





I also went to a games night they hosted which was hilarious! We literally had people from Canada, Aus, Mexico, Italy, Germany and more I think! So..... Needless to say with the Canadian version of the game Cranium, most of us couldn&apos;t figure out anything!  There was one I had - category &apos;thing&apos; which was &apos;speedo&apos;. Ryan, also an Aussie passed it to me, we both nodded like yup, know that one! And I proceeded to make a speedometer and a car to represent its context out of clay. Nope. Turns out that is the actual name here they use for swimmers! Like what we would call budgie smugglers! Oops. And it happened several times as we all just couldn&apos;t stop laughing!





A friend Gerald, who I met through a good friend from Topdeck, also had a farewell party full of amazing food and karoake!





It&apos;s hard to fit this whole working business in! :)





Another lovely couchsurfing guy who was packing up his life and going to South America for an indefinite period also gave me his good down sleeping bag and tent for free as well which was so nice!





Another random thing I have noticed is that my apartment block is missing floors 4, 14 and 24! Now I have heard of missing the 13th, but the entirety of floors with a 4?! Bizarre! I had a google and apparently there is an actual phobia - The fear of number 4! In Chinese culture this is considered to be unlucky and I guess the owner or whoever was Chinese! Random!

Food Blog! Vancouver, Canada

2011-03-27

Okay, I am only half way through this one!



Walking from my apartment I decided to check out downtown as I had really just been too busy to do it thus far!! Walking along Robson St, I stumbled across this awesome Lolly Shop I had been told about previously.....



Immediately as I entered The Candy Aisle ( http://www.candyaisle.com )to a warm and friendly hello, I felt like I had lost 20 years off my life... yup,I have to say it - literally like a kid in a candy store!



Everywhere you turned there were delicious treats enticingly laid out. Every kind of sweet imaginable, chocolates from around the world.... and my favorites - soap flavor gum; chocolate in medicine prescription boxes and flavored crickets. Yup, real flavored crickets...sour cream and chives, salt and vinegar, mexican spice! and Larvae too if you are that way inclined.



It is also open longer and really convenient hours so you can definitely get there. The perfect place to come for a present or a sweet treat, that is for sure!
 
Unpredicted amazingness- sun, tarotcards, cherryblossoms, beach, sunset, mansions and snowshoeing!!

2011-03-31 to 2011-04-03

An unpredicted amazing day- sunshine, tarot reading, cherry blossoms, beaches, sunset and mansion tour... Followed by snowshoeing! Vancouver to Mt Seymour, Canada



Not being one who knows anything, or takes much notice of clairvoyants, Tarot cards or the like, I agreed to help out another couchsurfer who was learning reading tarot cards and wanted to practice.



We met at a local Yaletown cafe (the suburb where I live) and actually found it kind of interesting to learn a brief history of the deck of tarot cards, complete with four suits and high picture cards that go back thousands of years and predate the modern decks of playing cards!



The four suits - pentacles, wands, cups and swords - are said to categorise the four major elements of life, respectively earth, fire, water and air and link with human emotions and characteristics.



I had to shuffle the cards to put my energy into them and Eeva laid them out in the table in a set pattern, one card at a time and explaining it&apos;s significance and relation to the location it was placed; I.e., present, recent past, near future, distant past, longer term future;  and other areas I can&apos;t remember!



I could then ask questions, thinking of it whilst shuffling, and then five cards were laid out to answer this.



It was quite interesting to see it all in action, and all positive, no dire predictions for the future like I kind of half expected to hear!



I guess only time will tell how accurate it may or may but be.... But let&apos;s just say it was a league ahead of the witch doctor I saw in Malawi who guaranteed me health... And I was stuck down with malaria that night! :-)





As it was the start of the Vancouver Cherry Blossom festival, I joined Eeva in heading to the Burrard st skytrain station further downtown to see the start of the festival. As we emerged from the skytrain we watched an amazing group of about ten Japanese drummers preform on the giant drums, dressed in the traditional black and White samuari (?) outfits, jumping around to the beats they were making. It was very cool! They also then combined it with some traditional aboriginal (yes, the indigenous people here are also called aboriginals!) dancers dressed up in animal costumes.



There were a lot of people around and just a small stage as we met up with another couchsurfer, Donna, and walked to town before deciding to head to one of the beaches - English Bay - to make the most of the rare day of sunshine.



We posed with the giant bronze statues of the large group of laughing men. Their expressions and poses so entertaining we couldn&apos;t help but smile with them.



Enjoying a marble slab (...the local version of cold rock!) icecream/ yoghurt, we then sat on the huge logs conveniently placed on the sand as seats and enjoyed the view out to Kitsilano, west Vancouver, the massive container ships in the harbour and Stanley park to the right.



Another couchsurfing friend, Naveed joined us with a friends dog as we walked along the picturesque seawall which runs around the entirety of the city and came across the giant stone statue of the Inukshuk, the mascot for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games. Score! I had already been here almost two months and I was seeing more of the Vancouver highlights in one day than I had in the entirety of the rest of my time here!



Walking the opposite direction, we entered Stanley Park, which is the second largest inner city park in North America, after Central Park.



Walking past third beach, up to second, we enjoyed the beautiful views, the amazing sunshine and greetings of other friendly residents out for the day. It was beautiful, but having beaches with fine, grey dust like sand is just nothing on the brilliant White sand of home!



We all piled into Naveed&apos;s car and drove through the pretty Stanley park, saw a super cool lake I will have to come back and check out and just how big the park really was.



Naveed was driving out through Kitsilano and so I decided to join him as he took me on a scenic tour of Kitsilano, the laid back beachside suburb to the west of downtown, and then to Point Grey, Which is where all the rich people reside! With beautiful, quiet, tree lined streets up on a rise giving the most amazing views back towards the city skyscrapers and beautiful snow capped mountain peaks behind. The funniest thing is that the roads were so crappy though! The worst we had been on all day! Dodgy potholes and poorly finished hole fillings! Hilarious!



The houses were so large that you couldn&apos;t even see the house front the gate at the start of the driveway! Some of them took up almost half entire blocks, with tennis courts, pools, beautifully manicured lawns, and you name it! Well.... This is what Naveed told me was in there- the perfectly pruned giant garden hedges were impossible to see over or through!



We passed private security guards sitting in their cars outside houses or driving slowly around the neighbourhood as we continued our journey.



It was SO weird though - all the Streets down near the golf course all had names of Aussie city and states??? Queensland, Tasmania, Adelaide...?!?! No idea why!



We continued our tour down to the beautiful, and practically deserted Jericho beach, a large stretch of sand, logs to sit on and then the view to downtown and the mountains over the water.



Sitting on a log we watched the sun set behind the trees in the parkland as its rays reflected off the windows on the city buildings behind us. So beautiful!



It was getting chilly though as we jumped back into the car and did a tour of thePacific Spirit Regional Park and UBC - the university of British Columbia with amazing prime real estate right on the beach!



I had managed more touristy things and seen more of Vancouver in one day than I had in almost two months of being here! AND the sun was out too! What a fantastic day in an amazing city!







And then My friend Brook who I had worked with at Topdeck in Europe called to see if I wanted to go Snowshoeing on Mt Seymour! Hell yes! Luckily it even fell on my day off!



Catching the bus out to Brooks in North Van; Brook, her boyfriend Ryan, and another Aussie friend Liz, we drove just 20 mins and were already on the fog covered path up the mountain!



Arriving at the parking lot, we grabbed snowshoes, met Ryans sister Jen and partner James, and we were off! The snow shoes were a thousand times different to the crappy ones I had used in Austria and hated! These were comfortable, gripped the snow like crampons and actually made it easier instead of more difficult! :-)



It was funny though as we set off, the three Canadians powering ahead, looking like naturals, and the three Aussies behind looking like amateurs/.... ducks :-).



It was beautiful as we followed the trail to First Lake. There was snow metres and metres deep and it was so funny that less than half an hour ago we were in the city in sunshine, and here we were on the top of a mountain in snow!



Walking through the trees we came across the lake that was covered over with about 3 metres of snow. There was a wooden fence about a metre high, then covered with another metre of snow that we had to walk over to cross the water, with the several metre drop either side of the snowshoe wide width. Scary! Still getting used to our snowshoes we struggled to cross, almost tripping over each shoe as they dug in with no room to move either side! Scary! But still super cool! :-)





The snow was coming down in massive thick chunks, like the size of almonds, as we walked and it was so amazing! I had never been in snow falling that thickly before.



A few steepish uphills and we were at the top of Dog Mountain! We had a little snow picnic and enjoyed the view as the fog momentarily cleared and we could see all the way out over Vancouver city! So cool!



Just another amazing thing about the city, one minute you are in the sunshine down in town, or on the beach, and less than half an hour later you are on a snow covered mountain! Brilliant! I love it!





Back in town, I caught up with a friend Katrina and some other couchsurfers in town who had just participated in the pillow fight flash mob ( www.pillowfightday.com ) that I had unfortunately arrived back just a little too late for. We later headed out to a house party some other couchsurfers were hosting and then onto the ANZA (Australian New Zealand Association) club ( www.anzaclub.org ). It was the first time I had really been out since I had malaria so was all excited for the evening.



Dubstep is massive here in Vancouver. Never heard of it? Don&apos;t worry, neither had I! It is a type of music, a kind of mix between house and drum and base, if that helps out at all! And the ANZA club had a dubstep party with no cover charge which was always nice!



I will mention again the massive drug scene that Vancouver also has, and as we entered it was a bit of a culture shock to see so many people zoned out on drugs going crazy dancing to the music in a trance like state. And, as we walked further in a crowd of people, both male and female either topless or in just ther bras dancing to the music. Katrina and I just looked at each other and simultaneously asked &apos;why are these people topless?!&apos; a question we never found the answer to!



Upstairs was more my thing as a live band played a mix of covers and their songs to a dancing audience with heaps of room to move. Much nicer! Unfortunately another girl who was a couchsurfer had had FAR too much to drink and ended up vomiting all down me as I tried to help her. She could not stand, move, or do anything and i could not find any ID in her bag with her address.  She was a quite a big girl so it made it very difficult to do anything. Luckily the club was almost closing and some really nice security and other lovely girls helped lie her in the recovery position and help out whilst we waited for the ambulance to arrive.



Great introduction to dubstep! And I only wanted three hours sleep anyway! Definitely not so fun getting up the next morning to be out of the house for work after what felt like no sleep. It was my first night with less than 6-7 hours sleep since I was sick with the malaria and I definitely struggled!
 
The Amazing Chase, Vancouver! Canada

Playoffs, brawl, flatmates from hell, quitting my next job and the bitter wage battle! Vancouver, CA

2011-04-08 to 2011-04-15

So, my bad flatmates were not getting any better! My other flatmates and I became united against them as we finally cracked! Bobby and Jen put up signs telling them to wash their own dishes, dry and put others away so the rack could be used. Ridiculous!!! So bad it had to come to this, but they were total pigs who never cleaned, left dishes for like four days until someone else cracked and did them, make messes and still totally ignored me. They were also so loud and so inconsiderate, not to mention using all my milk, eating stuff from my cupboards and then denying it, even when I caught them in the act!!!!



And then.... One of them was in charge for collecting the money for the hydro and shaw (utilities and internet) and just charged us extra so that her and her partner didn&apos;t pay!!!!!!! Can you believe it!!!!?!!? Bobby, the good flatmate decided to investigate and found out. Unbelieveable!!!!



I was ready to commit some kind of crime if pushed any further... When they gave their notice!!! Hooray!!!!!!



And so we began the serious issue of Interviewing new flatmates!!!! Bobby placed an ad asking for certain prerequisites such as clean!!! And then asked people to reply with information about themselves. He weeded out lots of applications from people who wanted to place an entire group in the room, others that could not speak English and all the freaks before selecting a shortlist of people to visit! We gave them the spanish inquisition with questions or entirely dismissed them before finally selecting a guy named Darren. Fingers crossed for next month!!!





I am also currently embroiled in a bitter battle with the Travel Company i previously worked for who refuse to pay me for the last week of work i did there before resigning. They are trying to say they wont pay me as i was on a two week trial as per the contract and i worked past that. The contract i refused to sign as it was incorrect, said i was on a commission based wage, not hourly rate, and asked for a new one which i did not get. I was asked to continue working and, as per BC labour laws they require to pay me for the time i worked.... But think they can get away with not paying me, and refused to answer phone calls or emails. Unfortunately for them I don&apos;t give up and have just issued an ultimatum that I will take it furrther! Other people  have had the same problem as me with them, but have just left it alone as it got too hard. My ex boss replied to one email &apos;what pay?&apos;, and then ignored all my calls and emails. I finally got hold of him ringing through the company and he just laughed at me. That was the last straw. It wasn&apos;t a lot of money, but there was no way he was going to get away with it now!!!! I received advice from friends and family here, spoke to the Canadian Employment Standards Board, and served them with paperwork telling them they had 15 days to pay before a legal complaint was filed against them. We are now involved in a   Bitter wage battle with no contact from them at all. I&apos;ll keep you updated! :-)



In other news! :-) I headed into Lougheed Mall, the big shopping centre near work one rare day on a break and felt a massive rush of heat and smoke as I opened the door as the fire alarms sounded and people were making a mass exodus.



Turns out there was a fire between the Walls in one of the stores, the mall was shutdown for the day and it also cut power to the area and traffic light for a few hours.



Heading home that night at almost 11pm after a marathon epicly long workday again, i happened to be in a carriage on the skytrain with several bunches of rowdy drunk guys who somehow devolved into a massive brawl. There was sickening thuds and cracks as everyone raced down to one end of the carriage to escape and press the security call button. The worst thing is that we were a massive distance from the next station as it continued and continued until we pulled up. People were trying to help, but it was pointless as we helplessly watched some poor guys head get rammed into things and stomped on on the floor. It was so awful I felt sick as the useless older security man and lady ran towards them, but it was already too late as the culpits had done their damage and made a bee line out of there, rushing past me and yelling directions for their &apos;mates&apos; to run. There was nothing I could do as I began to walk home, hoping that they would be okay and just glad it wasn&apos;t somewhere like Sydney or London where I am sure it would gave descended into weapons too.



The police cars flashing and sirens blazing rushed past me as I realised the attackers were directly in front of me trying to act normal. Before I could do anything the police had passed and they were gone again! SO awful! And it totally freaked me out. These things are not supposed to happen in Vancouver!!!



So all shaken I arrived home to find some amazing news.... My sister Bern and her husband Jas are expecting their first child!!! SO exciting! And even better it was the perfect time difference to call home! Yay!!! Congratulations guys!!!! Xxxxxx





And so after trying for so hard and so long to get a job in the fitness world, I finally ended up in the best gym there was, but still wasn&apos;t happy! The people and environment were amazing, but unfortunately the hours and requirements not. You were required to work extra hours unpaid in order to meet your sales goals and I ended up being there well over 12 hours several times a week when we were only paid for 8 hours and shifts were supposed to be 10 with a two hour (mostly notional!!) break. Add an extra hour of transit either way and it ends up being no fun at all!!  And getting home at midnight means no opportunity to do anything or get anything done. Our &apos;weekends&apos; were split over two random days during the week as well so it was impossible to do or plan anything, but not that it mattered as you were too tired to do anything anyway!



And so unfortunately realising things were only going to get worse, not better as we attempted to hit the monthly sales targets, I handed in my resignation. My sixth workplace in Vancouver.... Maybe that interviewer was right.... Maybe I am a flight risk after all! :-)



Although there was never any time to do the workouts or anything, when i wasnt dead tired i did enjoy my time, learning about the gym, meeting people and laughing with the sales team Mike, Jess, Luke, Gavin and Valeryyyyyyyyyyy.... Mostly about our scripts and day where every half hour block was scheduled and organised for us throughout the day... Identical every day. I was already so ingrained I am not sure what I will do planning my own time!



The sales office was also obsessed by Tex Mex seasoning that spiced up every single persons meals, grapefruit, tapioca, flavoured rice crackers, anything from downstairs at Pricesmart... And Red Bull!



I had to laugh at colleagues buying unhealthy items downstairs though and double bagging them to carry them through the gym and into the office covertly so no members would see! :-)



Could not wait to sleep though.... SO overtired and rundown!!!!





The local Ice Hockey team, the Vancouver Canucks, have also made the playoffs for the first time in a very long time... And for the first time ever, went in as the top team which means the entire city is even more hockey mad than normal! The buses flash &apos;Go Canucks Go!&apos; in between their route information, and everyone wears their hockey jerseys, bus drivers, people on the streets, at work over their business attire.... Everywhere!



I had to walk past the Rogers Arena (their home ground) the night the first playoff game was on and was just literally towed along in a sea three people deep all dressed in their blue jerseys! The atmosphere was amazing and there were cars driving around tooting, flags flying out of them and everyone talking about the game. The playoffs go for two months and I cannot even begin to imagine how crazy the city will go if we win!!





After suffering through an icy cold week of rain and freezing winds, the sunshine hit and i thought for sure Spring was here! But no..... It then came!!!! Snow! In mid April! In Spring!!! And geez was it cold! Looking out into the local hills the trees were all snowy topped and it was so pretty.... Even if feezing as the wet snow splattered down across the city. Luckily that seemed to be the end of it and fingers crossed for sunshine here on in! The high was just 3&apos; that day! Brrr! :-)




 
The hardest green runs ever... but boy are they stunning!! Whistler and Blackcomb! Canada

2011-04-09

I was picked up bright and early on Saturday morning by a friend, Greg, and we were off! Heading up to Whistler for the day!



It is a two hour drive and so beautiful to be winding through the mountains and alongside the water.



We had a quick stop off half way in the town of Squamish, and within two hours we were pulling into the Whistler parking lot! From there it was just a short walk into the town. So very easy and convenient!



I got a lift pass and then hired skis without any queues or waiting at all. It was amazing! Everyone always talks about how Whistler would shut down if it wasn&apos;t for the Aussies and that seemed to be an accurate representation as pretty much every single staff member there, be it selling lift tickets, fitting or hiring skis, operating the lifts, in the stores, bars or restaurants, were Australian!



We jumped into the first gondola, and it was unlike any ski lift I have ever been in as it was totally enclosed, with seats around the sides and you just walked in and out!



We arrived at the disembarkation point, and found an assortment of hundreds and hundreds of sets of skis on the railings, it was crazy!!



And then it was time! I gingerly placed on my skis and slowly started out down the slope..... And so far so good! I was pleasantly surprised that I remembered some of the basics and actually didn&apos;t end up falling over all day which was even nicer!!!!



The snow was the nicest I have ever skiied in, with inches of powder, evenly spread, no huge hills and then nothing to trap your skis, and even better no icy chunks or dangerous sheets of ice!!! It was amazing!



It was really odd to see as well - three different types of snow!  At the top it was all powdery, midway down it was all sticky, the kind you need to make snowballs or snowmen, and at the very bottom if was all slushy, literally like the freezies you get from 7-11! So much so the boys couldn&apos;t even get traction to push themselves up after falling on their snowboards, they just sank elbow deep! And then..... Just like water skiing to end! :-)





On one of the trips up, there was a Tour Guide in gondola who told us that the green runs here are the steepest green runs there are! Aha! I knew it wasn&apos;t just me!!



We also met Greg&apos;s brother Scott and friend Mark who joined us on the slopes, before catching the beautiful Peak to Peak Gondola from the top of Whistler, over the valley to the top of its sister peak, Blackcomb.



Blackcomb was my favourite. There were kilometers and kilometers of different runs, taking us about an hour to get all the way down. And doing a different trail each time, and with hardly any people at all of them! It was amazing. My favourite trails were the more narrow ones that weave through the woods, almost like a hiking trail (but wider! :-) ) they were amazing!





It was hilarious too, a run we were on joined onto another and as we kept right was a massive run of Moguls!!!! Too funny! Luckily we noticed in time and were able to safely avert course before our non existent skills in there broke us some bones!!!



It was super fun as our legs slowly started to go to jelly, we were starving and super parched as we finished the last run of the day and headed through the village to the Dubh Linn Gate Irish pub for a delicious burger and sculled glasses of water.



The whole atmosphere up there is awesome, totally chilled out and friendly and we saw people randomly skiing around dressed in a flowered doona, rabbit outfit and a kilt!



We took a walk through the village of Whistler which is so cute and picturesque with pedestrian only cobble stone streets, beautiful buildings and the stunning backdrop of the mountains behind; and it was time to jump back into the car and head home!



The ride home was equally stunning with amazing views around of the snow capped mountains, the ocean, islands and even the tracks of the Rocky Mountaineer train right alongside the road between us and the water. I have included a photo for you mum.... Not so good as it was taken through the window of a moving car, but thought you may like to see! (Mum and her friend Betty are doing the Rocky Mountaineer in September!)



There were various falls and parks alongside the road and a famous feature called the Chief which is supposed to be an awesome hike. We stopped at one - Shannon falls and in between the trees, it was a beautiful high falls falling over rocks fed from the snow melting in the mountains.



Arriving back into town we decided to take a detour to La casa!!! It is an amazing Italian Gelateria boasting 518 flavours with 218 flavours of gelato/ sorbets and frozen yoghurt available at any time!!!! (www.lacasagelato.com )



Entering the massive pink building I was overwhelmed by the MASSIVE choices! Being someone who is not good at decisions at the best of times I spent about three laps wandering the circuit until I decided on about five flavours to taste test and then went with nine of them!



There was garlic flavour - just in case you were wondering.... SUPER gross! It stunk so strongly of garlic even as he was just passing it over, and tasted like you had just put a spoon of minced garlic straight in your mouth... Only wit a disgusting creamy consistency!!!



Next up there was lavender. Yup, tasted just like you had eaten toilet freshener, with the awful aftertaste and clammy feeling in your mouth like it actually was.



And it continued on! Basil, curry, wasabi, guineas corn and more-  a dozen random flavours interspersed amongst the rest all normal and delicious sounding! I finally decided on a fruit yoghurt, and none of the ones I had actually tried!



To be honest the gelato was not all that good, but there was definitely a massive novelty factor and would surely go back again!!
 
Crazy Indian Parade, Main St, holiday in White Rock, Raccoons, PAID!, and my parcel!!! VAN, CA

2011-04-16 to 2011-04-21

http://vancouver.about.com/od/vancouverevents/p/vaisakhiparade.htm



16 April Crazy Indian parade, holiday in White Rock, random adventures and good news! I got paid AND my parcel from Africa arrived! Yay! B.C., Canada









One sunny afternoon I headed out with a friend, Rob, to see the Vaisakhi Indian parade at Main and 49th, a short drive from downtown Vancouver.



And it was crazy! There were ( i found out later!) 50 000 people there ..... It was just People....  and rubbish everywhere!



But the best thing about it was ......... Free food! Oh yes! :-) as we followed the music, parade and crowds down the street, every few metres there was some kind of table, marquee, back of a truck, dishing up piles of free food! Delicious Indian curries, rice, dahl, yoghurty goodness, various fried things and all sorts of massive varieties of tasty treats! It even progressed to tea, poppers, lollies and this crazy spicy fruit salad covered in chilli. And more than you could possibly eat! You just lined up, put your half empty plate out for another helping, or they just dished up a new one for you!!! Brilliant!!!!



A LOT of rubbish though around the streets in overflowing garbage bags to clean up afterwards!



Random brightly coloured floats that were just vehicles filled with people sitting in them which was really bizarre! Some pumping music, others words in a language we didn&apos;t understand... Clearly brainwashing propaganda we decided! :-)



We started following the parade, began walking in it and by the end were practically leading it and locals in their brightly coloured sari&apos;s lined the streets. So much fun! :-)



And... Even better... There was sunshine!!! I know i probably talk about the weather a little more than may be warranted, and it is strange for us souls from the land of sunshine, as it is usually a topic when all others have run out! But not here! It is a perfectly acceptable topic of conversation and frequent at that! And so I shall continue! Especially when there is sunshine involved as it seems to be quite a rare occurance at the moment!





A friend Liz and I decided to venture out to an area we had not yet been - Main st! We came across a tasty lolly shop to start the day and a super helpful and friendly sales assistant in a clothing store we popped into who gave us maps of the area and directed us to where we should best head to! So nice!



We wandered along and into some of the dozens of vintage stores that the area is known for. And it was awesome! They were massive stores, sometimes two levels of amazingness to search through and some epic finds! Fluro ABBA style flare suits and a crazy ice skating number we just had to try on as we couldn&apos;t stop laughing.



Another had beautiful authentic clothes from every era past. Stunning and intracitely made dresses, hats, coats and purses that we gazed at amazed. And the bigges dress up box ever!!!



It was awesome! There was even a bargain bin out the front of one that was free!! I picked up a black fur shawl and brightly tie dyed random fairy dress!!! How cool!!



Getting tired, it was time to meet some couchsurfers at Foundations, a well known local restaurant where your drinks are randomly served from old jam jars!!



They are famous for their nacho&apos;s and so Liz and I shared a plate... Of epically mega proportians, of which we probably got through half! Good... But nothing on the best nacho&apos;s in the world prepared by my sister Bern!





With my friend Brook living in West Van, it was the perfect opportunity to head out there and walk the North Shore seawall! It is one of my favourite things about Vancouver having it around the entirety of downtown, and even better everyone gets out there and uses it every day! It is awesome!



The views to the mountains were stunning and we just kept stopping and exclaiming how beautiful it was as we walked along the water. Amazing!!!





I decided to take a few days out for a mini holiday in White Rock with my cousins, Kay and Elmer.



It was awesome as i arrived and was picked up by Kay at the bus stop to head home to have dinner with Barb and Guy (their parents) and Perry (their friend) as well as Kay and Elmer and watch the Vancouver Canucks  hockey game! Awesome!



I had a great few days chilling out, baking muffins and shopping with Kay and her daughter Alenna at costco... This crazy amazing store I love with everything you could possibly want and more! AND cheap! SO good!!!



I even had an opportunity to catch up on sleep, get through emails, catch up on admin abd finally get some stuff done again! Double Amazing!!!



In other news....! :-)

I got a phone call from my previous boss (the company who was refusing to pay me my final pay check), spitting mad about the papers I had served on him from the employment standards board. He kept going on about how they just laughed about me doing it, how they were the wrong papers, how he said he would get the money, and there was no reason to do it and it was pointless, blah, blah, blah but Long story short I was getting paid, so as angry as I was about our entire conversation, I got the outcome anyway! The next week I went in and picked up the cheque, we had a nice conversation and it was over! Yay!





In more exciting news just after I had had this conversation, I was on skype with my mum who told me my package I had sent from South Africa had arrived!! From January!!! Almost four months!!! And her birthday card also, sent even before the parcel! It was amazing news as I had given up hope of ever seeing any of them again!!! It was quite funny as I had sent four things at the same time, postcards and birthday cards, dropped into the mailbox together. One had arrived within 2 weeks, one (to the exact same address)  in almost four months and the remainder still M.I.A.!!





Street food is pretty famous here and so I tested out my local hot dog man who resided daily in his little cart in the seawall just down from my house. Alex, the hot dog guru roasted them up to perfection your choice of about 15 different hot dog meats and flavours onto a choice of three different buns and then sauces and toppings! Wow! Things have definitely progressed since last time I attempted to buy a hot dog!!





And who could forget April the 20th, or 4/20 as it is known here! I have written before about the massive drug culture of Vancouver, and so much so it even has it&apos;s own day! The term &apos;420&apos; refers to more or less smoking weed and as you can imagine at 4:20 on 4/20, the entire city pretty much came to a standstill and you could no longer see ir smell anything through the haze of the 420 smoke. Only in Vancouver!!!!





Another awesome outing and Vancouver must see is Stanley park, which I have touched on before, the massive park in downtown. I met a friend Lance and walked the beautiful trails through the woods, around the lake and even fed a friendly racoon from a baguette we were carrying!!! It was strong too, developing into a little game of tug of war as it held on to rip the soft inside out of the bread!! Super fun! And no rabies... Always a good way to end the day! :-)






 
An Camping Easter on Vancouver Island, Vancouver, CA

2011-04-22 to 2011-04-24

A random bunch of people from couchsurfing had decided to head to Vancouver Island to go camping for the Easter weekend and now I didn&apos;t have a job I was free to join them!



I packed up ready and jumped on the bus just several blocks from my house that went comveniently all the way to the ferry terminal in Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver.



Getting off the bus I randomly ran into Susanne and Jimena, two other couchsurfers on the camping trip who were also on my bus.



The ferry terminal was crazy! The queues were out the door as we lined up to get onto the midday sailing. We got a text from another couchsurfer we had not met before saying he looked &apos;dishevelled and in a Cuban hat&apos; so we had a great laugh sitting at the front of the ferry and watching every single of the hundreds of people board until we picked out Rahul!



The view was stunning as we set sail for Vancouver Island, snow capped mountains all around us! But a little too chilly to be on the outside deck as we hid inside.



Randomly my friend Brook and her boyfriend Ryan were also on our ferry after having been lining up since 8am to get their car on. Convenient to be a foot passenger!



Arriving in Nanaimo we knew we were looking for a blue truck and black Honda to meet the other couchsurfers from the Island who were picking us up. In the distance we spotted a blue truck, giant stuffed shark adorning the top with Easter bunny attached on top and two cars next to it each with an Easter bunny strapped to the front. We had found them! There we met Dylan, Julie, Beth, Lauren, Balbina and Vitek, our crazy worldwide crew who we would be camping with!



We stopped off to buy supplies at the supermarket, never a fun task when trying to coordinate 8 different people, strapped it onto the back of the truck, covered most of it with a tarp, and we were off! Well, even more off as we entered the highway and the rolls of paper towel flew off the back of the truck and were lost into the roadside abyss. Needless to say we kept a safe distance behind after that ! :-)



As usual with a group we had no idea what was going on as we stopped about another four times, but eventually we were really on our way to Tofino! It was about a 300km drive to the southern side of Vancouver Island and so beautiful, passing lakes, rivers, forests and snow capped peaks everywhere.



The trees slowly got taller and taller and much more dense as they formed a canopy over our heads as we arrived in Cathedral Grove in Mcmillan provincial park. There are dozens of different boardwalks you can follow through the forests, looking at all the magnificant giant trees as we had a quick photo stop.



As we continued there suddenly began to be several feet of snow on the sides of the road as we stopped and had an impromptu snowball fight! Perfect weather for camping in...! :-)





We stopped for gas at one point and i had to laugh at the sign adorning the door - &apos;shoes required. Pants and shirts optional!&apos;. We were a comical site as we all piled out of our convoy, prompting another patron to ask &apos;are they a band or something?!&apos;.





We had recently changed the planned campsite we were staying at and at the junction were supposed to turn towards Ucluelet.... But duly followed the convoy as we headed the opposite direction to Tofino. Almost at the extent of the road we watched as Dylan&apos;s truck, the lead car in the convoy stopped at a campsite to ask the local who laughed abd pointed the opposite direction, back the way we had come!  So we say we took the Scenic route to Tofino and as it was practically sunset, made a pitstop, driving down on the jerry where we watched the sunset over the water. Ahhh lovely!



An hour later we returned to Ucluelet where we located our campground, surf junction ( www.surfjunction.com ), set up camp, cooked a potato, onion, steak and veg feast over the campfire and huddled around it for warmth.



We had been warned on checkin that this week was known notoriously as the week in which the bears awoke from their hibernation and started hunting around for food.



As a result we could not have any food around our campsite or tents, it all had to be locked into the cars! They even found their way into coolers and shredded tents if they even smelt the scent of toothpaste, shampoo or conditioner. All rubbish had also to be taken away and put into bear proof bins. A little different to camping back home!





Retiring to bed I have never been so grateful for my amazing super duper down - 10 down sleeping bag that was toasty toasty warm. The best $3 I ever spent after it was replaced on insurance after my original sleeping bag (which was councidently a gift from another couchsurfer!) was stolen from the laundromat. Amazing!!! I was so happy and cosy as I snuggled down for the night!



We awoke and had a breakfast feast with cereal and poached eggs on fire cooked sourdough toast to start the day..... Hmmm certainly easier cooking for eight people than 50!!! :-)



We hit the road and headed off to the surfing beach where we dropped a couple of people off, Before continuing on to long beach, which, unsurprisingly enough is a long beach! It was lovely, but I guess growing up in Australia and travelling I have been spoilt by crystal clear water and beautiful White sand and I just cannot look at the grey diet here the same way!



It was the warmest day thus far this year, but still beanie and fleece weather as the cold water and wind attacked us! Swim? No thanks! :-)



We walked along the beach, sat on the logs chatting and eating before we headed to the most beautiful point - tofino Harbour. Here standing on the quiet jetty you had the most amazing views of the blue water, snow capped mountains and forests and my dream home!  The house there on the water was amazing, just sitting on the waters edge with its own jetty and the most amazing view! Stunning!



We dropped off those heading out kayaking and Rahul, Balbina, Julie and I walked down towards Tofino town, stopping in cute little places along the way, Reading comical signs, refusing to buy icecream due to some super rude employees, to an amazing bakehouse and then down the pretty quiet streets to Tonquino park, a sign warning us going the other direction &apos;extremely steep hill!&apos;.



We enjoyed the walk down the beautiful wooden boardwalk through the forest as the beach opened out in front of us to a private cove lined with rocks and forests and amazing! We clambored over the rocks to sit and enjoy the atmosphere before exploring the other little coves around us. So beautiful and practically deserted!



Island life is definitely much more laid back and relaxed. The opening hours signs indicated closing early in bad weather, staying open longer in sunshine and surf dependant!



Unfortunately I spent the majority of my time there with a streaming nose and red, scratchy streaming eyes. I couldn&apos;t figure out what was going on until I was talking to a shopkeeper, apologising for the state of me when she explained everything - &apos;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s the wood, usually the cedar. It happens to a lot of people visiting here.&apos; ah ha!!! Allergies! So, for the first time in my life I was subject to what so many other people go through on a seasonal basis. Hmm. Not fun! At all!!





Heading back we met the others and drove back to camp to cook. Dylan had brought along a bunch of seafood given to him by other couchsurfers and so pulling it out of the esky we attempted a seafood marinara over the campfire. Hmm! Adventurous! There were prawns, clams and cockels. Cockels? What on earth were they?! I had never seen them before and neither had any of the others. It also said &apos;uncleaned&apos;. Riiiiiight. Opening the package I figured out they had to be de-veined, like prawns. Poor Susanne had no idea what she was getting in for as she attempted to cut them with a butter knife and scrape out the innards. Not fun! And so time consuming! She eventually washed them and gave up half way. More than enough cockels we figured!



We threw in the GIANT bag of clams, the rest I had precooked and with our pasta, sweet potato and salad had the most ginormous feast. But ew, clams! So gross! Rahul explained it right when he commented it was just like chewing rubber until it exploded and all their fishy innards went through your mouth. Needless to say these all got picked out and thrown into the fire. Yuck!



It was then time to quickly get changed and jump into the awesome outdoor hot tub before it closed! We all crammed in, joining new friends also camping at the site as we had about 16 or more all enjoying the warmth in the practically subzero outdoors.



And during the evening the rains started. We had seen the weather so we made sure we were well set up and luckily our tent was also super and we stayed totally dry. We strung up a tarp the bext morning to try and keep the fire going to cook the hit cross buns  for breakfast!  But with rain scheduled for the remainder of the long weekend, Julie, Vitek and I decided to call it a wknd and head home! We jumped in the car and drove the several hundred kilometres back to the Nanaimo ferry departure bay, and arrived in perfect time - there was one leaving in half an hour! It was a cold and windy ride back with fog obscuring any mountain views, so we hunkered down inside to for the journey. Beating the several hundred other foot passengers we managed to get the first bus and we were on our way home!



What a cool weekend, but also a relief to be back in Vancouver&apos;s positively balmy weather where one did not require a full set of thermals underneath the other zillion layers on!



We dropped our stuff, showered and I then met Vitek at the Lennox Pub downtown to watch the Canucks playoff game in the Hockey. Unfortunately they lost in sudden death overtime which has put us at a 3-3 game draw with Chicago in the best of seven game series. We had to win the next game to avoid elimination!
 
A Canadian ANZAC Day, the playoffs, malaria brain, and my first overseas visitor!! Vancouver, B.C.

2011-04-25 to 2011-05-01

Worlds away from my past two years spent on the Western Front in France and Belgium, I attended the VancouverANZAC day service at Victory Square, a monument just a few blocks away from my house.



I met some friends, Ryan, an ex Aussie sailor and his girlfriend Christie in the grey overcast weather as we watched the service. It started with Canadian pipers from the British Columbia Regiment planting flags and then proceeded with the remainder of the service, very similiar to any I have ever been to, except it was at 6pm, not dawn, it was raining on us and there were only about a hundred people there. It was put on by the Australian and New Zealand Canadian business association and really nice to be able to take part so far away from home.



Three trays of lamingtons were brought out as we finished up to fuel us up for the walk to Mooses Downunder, an Aussie Bar several blocks away. We randomly met my new flatmate Darren as we joined his friends listening to live Aussie songs and watching the AFL on the screens! Good times!!





So, I know I have written about the local National Hockey League (NHL) team the Vancouver Canucks being in the playoffs before, but it is BIG!!



We had to win four out of the seven games against The Chicago Blackhawks to proceed to the next round of the playoffs. We won the first three.... Then lost the next three (one in sudden death overtime). So the final do or die game was tied at three all!



It was played here at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, right down the road from me and the city was already a crazy frenzy of blue Canucks jerseys by the mid afternoon. I was headed to the Academia, a pub on Broadway with a friend Michelle to meet up with her new flatmates and friends.



And it was tense... We scored within the first five minutes and were 1-0 dominating the entire game until two minutes before the end. 1-1. Sudden death overtime. Luckily within a few nail biting minutes we had won. Wow!!!! The city started to go crazy. People were screaming, shouting, singing, and cars tooting all over. Heading home the bus was packed full of supporters who started chants, high fived everyone, and it was an amazing happy atmosphere.



As we got off the bus we could hear a massive crowd roaring and so headed up towards the noise. The main street of town, Granville Street, had been blocked off to traffic and there was a massive impromptu street party! Cars everywhere were hooting, there were people playing music, singing, cheering, waving flags, passing around replicas on the Stanley Cup, (what the teams are trying to win), and going so crazy happy! Everyone was talking to everyone, giving out random high fives and hugs, it was amazing!!!!!! They love their team here and I cannot even imagine to think how crazy awesome it will be if we win! Or how awful it will be if we don&apos;t....





Let me also just say the whole malaria thing will not leave me alone! My cousin Tracy calls it &apos;brainfog&apos; and it is not getting any better. It is a constant surprise to me to find things where I had no idea that I left them, but the worst is I just lost my sunnies I have had for the past 13 years and the really annoying thing is I have absolutely no idea at all where they might be, where I might have left them or even when I had them last!!!  So gutted!!!!



Three consecutive days I also went shopping and brought giant bunches of baby spinach, forgetting I had done so previously until I got home and tried to put it in the fridge each time. Argh!!





It is definitely not helping my job interviews either, forgetting answers to questions I am asked that I should know... Like my phone number! And when asked a professional skill I needed to work on, the best I could come up with was .... Ahhhhhh I can&apos;t think of the word..... Where you task people.... Which she kindly helped with ... &apos;delegation?&apos; And then had to explain why I was so useless! The chick was really good about it all though and still signed me up for her recruitment agency. But still!!!!! Funny at first. Now over it! :-)





I also met up with another friend, Ryan one evening to attend an Improv show on granville island at the aptly named &apos;Improv Centre&apos;. It was absolutely entirely random - a musical about life on a farm where a group of five actors sung songs, preformed different random characters by quickly tossing on a quick costume prop by the side of the stage, or by adopting a different posture or voice and then looking at the person next to them as a sign they were up next and to start  listening and thinking of a line!!!



Really funny though, a couple of the guys were absolutely brilliant! Good value too, a live show for just $14!! (www.vtsl.com Vancouver TheatreSports League ).





Another beautiful sunshiney spring day I also walked Stanley park with katrina which was so beautiful! And so massive! And so stunning! :-) Lakes, squirrels, ducks, swans, fountains, cherry blossoms, herrons and all with a perfect snow capped mountain backdrop!





A good thing of having so much time available is that i was also able to get my volunteer job, ( or karma yoga as they call it ) back at westcoast hot yoga which was awesome to be able to be back doing an organised exercise class again.





I also tried out a cross fit session. (www.crossfitwestside.ca ) This is a semi new phoenomina sweeping the world and so wanted to check it out. There was a studio right around the corner and it offered a free trial class! Perfect! The day I attended I was the only participant in the basic class and completed a warmup of skipping, leg swings and range of motion exercises with dowel poles, followed by a rather slow and boring technique session where I learnt how to correctly preform a press. I wasn&apos;t too happy as she kept telling me I had to squat with my knees going forward of my toes, which is not good technique, especially when you have dodgy knees such as mine. She then tried to make me practice and perfect the technique with a bar that was too heavy for me and so I couldn&apos;t preform the movement properly. But apparently that was the purpose..........  Hmmmm...........



That complete it was time for the &apos;WOD&apos; or workout of the day, which was box jumps, presses with too heavy for me dumbells that I had absolutely no technique with, and then situps, one intense minute of each and then a minute rest, three times through. And then a stretch to cool down.



I can most definitely see the benefits of the program, being pushed with the relatively small student to instructor ratio, the motivation of others and the  short intense workout, but definitely do not agree with the way that teacher was teaching!!! Also learning the correct techniques for the eight different movements takes at least a month or two and I think I would go crazy with that slow painful process every week for that long!! Not that it really mattered as I could not possibly afford the hefty $166 per month (+tax!:-) ) pricetag for 2 classes a week, but glad I got to see what all the fuss was about!





My friend Eric also came to visit from Texas. It was super exciting to have my first overseas visitor! He flew two flights to get to Seattle and then drove up from there which was awesome!! We had originally met at Spanish School in Santiago, Chile in March 2008 when I first started traveling! Cool hey!



We walked downtown and met my friend Katrina at her work, and then headed down to &apos;The famous warehouse&apos; a cool little pub on Granville street where you can get meals for $5!  Score! We tried the famous Canadian poutine - melted cheese curd and gravy over French fries, which was okay.... If you like all those greasy things together!!



We then had our delicious meals and headed home before Eric passed out on the table after his epic fourteen hour marathon journey to get here!



The next day dawned a beautiful sunny spring day as we wandered to our local waves coffee shop to claim free almond later with vouchers from the free city paper.  (oh yes, the life of an unemployed person inVancouver! :-) ) But apparently there was a reason they were giving them away free as both Katrina and Eric struggled to finish them!  We wandered around downtown Vancouver, checking out the random stores and out to the waterfront and the famous Olympic flame, which I have to say Eric was less than impressed with! We ate cream puffs, which are kind of like giant, but soft profitteroles which are then pumped full of a flavoured custard, such as vanilla or caramel from the &apos;best cream puffs&apos; store, Beard Papa&apos;s.



We visited the famous steam clock in Gastown and headed home through Chinatown to cook up a feast. Obtaining &apos;new&apos; plastic cutlery from the take away section of the supermarket so we could eat at home as our cupboards had been stripped bare by the housemates from hell as they left! Yup, we were eating out of old plastic containers we had saved from yoghurts or packaged foods with random plastic cutlery! Just like being back at uni again! :-)



I had to laugh as Eric told me the day was the longest he as  a (  self titled!) &apos;lazy american&apos; had walked in forever!



The Canucks were playing as we walked down to The Cambie, a pub a few blocks away to commiserate with the rest of Vancouver as we watched our hockey team lose out in the second overtime to the Nashville Predators. Gutted! The drinks were quite cheap though (which is always nice in a place where the cost of living is so high!)  as we chatted to some new Swiss friends and almost four hours of Hockey later, as not a die hard Vancouver hockey supporter, Eric was fast losing interest in the game!!



We headed up to Granville St, but sick of standing in super long queues, we found a cute little Irish Bar to finish the night off in.



It was a struggle for Eric to get moving the next morning as I met Darren, our new flatmate that we had carefully selected from interviews a few weeks ago, showed him around and then headed out for coffee.



For some bizarre reason, all rentals in Vancouver are done on the first of the month, so everyone moves out on the last day of the month and the others move in on the first. I guess you have to book moving vans quite in advance!! The best thing about this first of the month was that the flatmates from hell were gone!!! Yay!!!! A parting gift from them a ton of dishes for us to wash and a lot of cleaning, but it was a small price to pay for never having to see them again!



We drove Darren out to an amusement park with his mate before heading off through beautiful Stanley Park and over the Lions Gate bridge to the North Shore. The two concrete lion statues guarding the bridge were both adorned in giant Canucks Jerseys which I thought was brilliant! Too slow to get the camera out for that one though!



The was a crazy mass of roadworks on the other side and we ended up on the wrong road, ended up heading back across the bridge as we attempted to correct it and decided it was not meant to be as we headed out to Granville Island instead, took a wrong exit, ended up stuck in traffic and then caught by roadblocks trying to get to Kits beach. Ah it was definitely not meant to be as we headed home to eat and then down to people watch in the glorious sunshine on the Sea Wall at False Creek.



We walked into town, met our friend Katrina and drove out to Commercial Drive to have amazing, super cheap sushi  at this awesome little place called Taiyo Sushi. The server was so sweet, a Japanese Grandpa and it was so lovely. An amazing 18 piece sushi feed with Miso soup for just $6.25. It may be the cheapest feed in all of Vancouver!! We were eating leftover sushi for days though! :-)



Being close by, we couldn&apos;t resist a drink outside in the Spring sunshine before popping into the 218 flavour gelato shop La Casa so Eric and Katrina could experience for themselves the &apos;delight&apos; of garlic, saffron, poppy seed and many other equally as entertaining flavours!



And alas it was over! We dropped Katrina home and bright and early the next morning Eric was off home to Texas with another epic 14 hour travel day!





But one final nasty surprise.... Bed bugs! So i am aware that Vancouver is infested with them, but I have also spent four years traveling the world, staying in all manner of nasty places with just one close encounter. So of course the place I get them is at my home. Nice. Not!



So kindly giving up my bed for Eric turned out to be a nightmare for him as he was totally attacked. I figured it must have been some random rogue mosquito or the like, but closer analysis of other friends who had crashed at mine all revealed similiar symptoms.... Nooooooo! Just luckily .... Or unluckily whatever the case may be, bugs do not like me since I had malaria and so I have never been attacked since!  By anything!  At all!! The silver lining I guess! :-)



And so the eradication begins. We thoroughly checked the bed and they are not there visible to the naked eye. I did find a few random strays on my comforter seam though tucked underneath so yet to establish their source or how to get rid of them. The fun begins!!! But not just for me as they had to come from somewhere and the flatmate from hell also told Eric she was regularly bitten by them. Nice. And nice welcome to the house surprise for our new flatmate Darren!!!





I know you are all hanging out to know the hockey score too.....!!!! :-)  - Vancouver are now at a 2 games versus 1 in the seven match series against the Nashville Predators, the last match a sea of hideous bright yellowish orange predator supporter jerseys at the Nashville home game. All games having to go into overtime, after us leading the entire match and then the Predators scoring in the last five minutes - once in the last 67 seconds! Argh!

Car Washes? Five in a row? Yes please!  Lyn Valley and Waffles,  Vancouver

2011-05-21 to 2011-05-31

Sooooo, jumping online to check my banking I was confused to find almost a thousand dollars of seperate transactions at various petrol stations around Vancouver at $90 a pop. And five car washes... In a row! Now, I know my memory is not the best at the moment, but surely I would remember buying a car, filling it, as well as several of my mates daily, and shouting the entire car wash to free washes! Yup! Although I still had my card on me, clearly somehow the information had been stolen.



So I duitfully called up Visa, registered my card as &apos;stolen&apos;, cancelled it, cut it into pieces and said goodbye to my source of money!!!!! Nooooooooooo!



My bank (back in Oz) was really good, answering my email on the weekend and immediately placing a new card in the mail to me here in Canada. Let&apos;s hope it arrives soon, and they are equally as efficient at investigating and returning my money to me!!!! :-)



Ahhh unfortunately I have a postscript to add! So, when I emailed to inquire as to the whereabouts of my card, I was curtly told that it would be sent once I provided an address. In total shock, I literally sent back an email saying &apos;ARE YOU SERIOUS??!?!&apos; and forwarded on email confirmation from them that said &apos;thanks for providing your address, we will send the card off today&apos;... Over a week prior.



I also called up and left a scalding message on their answering machine and within 15 minutes my mobile was ringing. The problem, as I had indicated when my card was cancelled, was that I required this to withdraw money from my Audtralian savings account in order to pay rent as at the first of the month. Which now left me in quite the predicament with just 3 days to go! After some heavy words, the bank offered to complete a international transfer directly to the real estate agent and waive the fees.



Of course it was not that simple as they told me what information I needed, and as rentals are done directly through landlords and not real estate agents, I painfully contacted our nasty landlord. Then again for additional information they needed to complete it, and then again. ARGH!!! Oh and then they needed a signature before they would processes it! So annoying! And not about to pay exorbadent fees for an international fax as they told me to do  I took a digital photo of my signature, downloaded it and told them to kindly accept it or find another solution!



Now.  About those fees that were apparently being waved. In the end I received $60 worth of these and am amidst the battle of attempting &apos;to get this back.



No word on the investigation yet either....



Ahhh just as well I don&apos;t gave a job, I wouldn&apos;t have time to fit it in!!! :-)





With the promise of summer just around the corner, I found a cheap pair of rollerblades and guards on craigslist, our online classifieds and hit the seawall. It has probably been at least ten years since I have rollerbladed, and after a few shaky moments I more or less remembered. Except it is steep to get there and rather than risking running uncontrollably onto the traffic on the road, I merely waited on the grass up the hill slightly and found kind pedestrians to push the crossing buttons for me so I didn&apos;t have to move!



It was a long weekend for Victoria Day.... Aka Queen&apos;s Birthday back home!

And Unfortunately the flu hit me and I spent the weekend in bed...... Hanging out for the day I am healthy again!!!!  But recovered sufficiently enough to meet some fellow couchsurfers to head out to Lyn valley, a forest and canyon on the North Shore.



We caught the Seabus over to North Vancouver, had a look at the awesome markets at Lonsdale Quay, enjoyed the sunshine and view back to Downtown and jumped on the bus for the journey.



Unfortunately a lot of other people also had the same idea, but we just joined them as we headed out onto the suspension bridge across the canyon and down to the amazing crystal clear water of the canyon. But brrr it was cold! Melting straight off the moutains, it was definitely nicer to watch from a distance!



We hiked around the beautiful and peaceful forests before heading back home to meet up with friends for the weekly trivia night at the pub.





In between times i also went to lunch at this cool little restaurant where they make waffles into sandwiches!  Miura Waffle Milk Bar! They bake your choice of meat directly into the waffle as the &apos;bread&apos;, so I had salmon waffle with salad in between! Actually tasty!





I also joined Dana and Fabien for an Africa night at Radha Yoga centre and Eatery, We thought it was African music, but alas contemporary music and dance to raise money for Africa! It was interesting at least to see some local Vancouver artists!

I will keep posting this, because people need to know what the deal really is with *****. no matter how many times I need to do it.







WARNING!! ***** are the biggest scammers out there!! do not go through them! Myself and a Friend went through them

and we paid thousands of dollars only for them to do nothing, they even forgot to pick my friend up from the airport even though it ws arranged.

you basically do everything yourself from finding work, finding accommodation, applying for a bank account, getting a SIN number.Not to mention, theyre staff are extremely unprofessional! dont bother with them unless you want to waste well earned money on these horrible companies.

This is what we live for! Stanley Cup Playoffs, Vancouver 2011 updated!

2011-06-05

Vancouver.... Game Days.... It captures the absolute craziness that has gripped the city! It is unbelievable!!!



The motto is &apos;This is what we live for&apos; and I think it pretty much sums up the city to a T!



After Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaI40QL5B5w&amp;feature;=youtu.be - It is long, no need to watch it all, maybe skip to like 4 mins and watch like 30 seconds to see!!



Watching the game in downtown - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDu2C4F6qlE&amp;feature;=related - again, 3o seconds will give you the feel of what it is like!!!



A random selection of photos of Canuck fever! - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UkZl82z17Y&amp;feature;=related









The hockey has overtaken lives. The playoff series saw our local team, the Vancouver Canucks win the Western Conference games to take on the Boston Bruins- the chamipons of the Eastern Conference Games for the Stanley Cup.



The city is totally decked out in blue, green and White and there are constant road closures, diversions and giant screens all around downtown for people to watch the game at.



The first game of the seven game series was epic - we scored the winning goal to make the Game 2-1 with 19 seconds to go. It was unbelieveable! Never say it&apos;s over til it&apos;s over! :-)



The next game, tied at 1-1, we scored Just 11 seconds into the first overtime period. It was amazing! If you blinked you would have missed it!!!



And the city went crazy. If there was a mote intense word than crazy, that would be it! Celebrations were crazy. The city erupted with tens of thousands jamming the city streets, high giving, honking horns, chanting, dancing, you name it!!! Even though the games started at 5pm, were generally over by just after 8pm, the streets were packed, people were cheering and horns were honking still at 1am when I awoke to hear it. Crazy!!



You can actually literally the sounds of the entire city cheering from anywhere you go, it is unvelieveable. Before the game it is crazy, buses, the skytrain and roads are chockas as people rush to get somewhere... And then the dead calm as the entire city unites wherever they are to cheer and then flood the streets celebrating! Walking home from Waterfront to Yaletown, three different areas, it is a constant flow of people high fiving, dancing, celebrating, cheering and chanting, and interacting with fellow strangers, but locals and therfore Canuck supporters around them.



The trains have transit alerts - not updates to services, but game updates, and everyone sports the blue, White and green everyday. Walking around the streets, servers in restaurants, businessmen over their suit pants, bus drivers, anyone you can think of! And hockey sticks draped with Canucks flags over their shoulders! Tens of thousands of people pack the city streets, rain, hail or shine to watch the game outside and show their support. It&apos;s like the biggest event you can think of happening.... Every second night!!



Cars, houses and shops are also decorated, entirely decked out with flags, hockey posters, life size cardboard cutout of the players, go Canucks go signs, Stanley cup replicas, jerseys and Canucks symbols. Crazy! I have never seen anything like it!!



City landmarks, I have spoken before about the lions guarding the Lionsgate bridge, but statues in parks, the mermaid and runner in Stanley park and other random ones around the city are decked out in Canucks jerseys, posters, hockey sticks and cups! The fever is crazy!!!



Unfortunately the third game did not go according to plan!  We watched this on a giant outdoor screen in a park next to Burnaby City Library which was awesome, just chilling out on the grass in the sunshine!!



It was a massacre. The Canucks losing 8-1. One of our players was suspended and one of theirs stretchered off to hospital in the first five minutes. And it only got worse from there!

There were full on Fights, 2 x 10 minute penalities, at one stage there were 4 in penalty boxes, 4 in change rooms after being escorted off the ice and not to return by the referees, 1 in hospital, I suspended, 3 on 3  playing on the rink (it is supposed to be 5 on 5) and a practically empty sub bench!!



And even worse, on our power plays when Boston was a man down due to penalties, when we should have been dominating the play and scoring, they scored against us!!! Crazy!!!



And then our next game had us lose 4-0. So from leading the series 2-0, it was now a tie at 2-2 for the first to 4.





The funniest thing was even though the last two games were &apos;away&apos; games held on Boston, the entirety of Rogers Arena was still sold out as people crammed in there to watch the games on the big screens! You know you are onto something good when the team is not even playing there and it is a sellout!!



Next game, game 5 was a home game again and after a nailbiter we came victorious1-0.  1 more game to win the cup!!!!



100 000 people flocked to the city streets to watch it. Yup. C.R.A.Z.Y!!!



Luckily I had the privledged of watching it in my friend Fabien&apos;s office with Corey. It is an I.T. Company with stunning waterfront views over to North Vancouver, the mountains and back into the city. There was free unlimited beer on top there constantly, a crazy futuristic office with everything touch pad controlled, every modern convenience you could ask for, comfy couches, an open plan kitchen and living room complete with various massive touchscreen computer screens and half the office just hanging on there on Friday night to watch the game! We sat in the huge conference room with a three massive flat screen tv&apos;s, comfy chairs and it was amazing!!!



We then pulled in a few couches, settled in and watched a movie on the massive screens!!!! It was brilliant!!! Corey and I just kept looking at each other stunned and wondering how we could get jobs there!!!



Oh yes... Back to the hockey!!! Game 6 is in Boston and the final game 7 back in Vancouver.



Unfortunately I will not be on Vancouver to experience the craziness that will come of the final games due to deploying to Alberta with the Red Cross (reference my next blog), but I still hope we can bring home the cup!



As amazing as it has been, the hockey has been going on forever - the playoffs alone have lasted three months (!!) with games generally every second night so I am very much looking forward to getting my nights back!!! :-)









in other news... I know I say this a lot, but my focus this week is getting the 7 3/4 finished blogs off my ipod touch onto here so hopefully!! :-)
 
Red Cross Volunteer Deployment - Assisting with the Alberta Fire Recovery Operations

2011-06-13

Well, it has been a crazy few weeks! Most notably, for the first time in many many months I have actually felt totally well again which has been more amazing than I can describe!! I have also actually started actively looking for a full time job again and have been working casually as an event host for a few fun activities such as the &apos;amazing chase&apos; and &apos;survivor&apos; type challenges for schools and corporate team building activities, which I love. Unfortunately it is not full time! :-)



As many are also aware, I joined up to become a Red Cross Disaster Management Volunteer when I arrived in Vancouver earlier this year and have enjoyed doing the training, participating in things like &apos;Emergency Preparedness Week&apos; and most recently in the Call Centre and working in the Central Registry and Inquiry Bureau to assist in the support effort for the Wildfires in Alberta, the next province over to us.



Over 100 out of control wildfires raged across the area of the province with 22,000 hectares on fire and I heard a third of the town of Slave Lake was destroyed. To date, over 8000 evacuees have been registered, at least 5 evacuee centres were established and over 14 000 volunteer hours have been logged by Red Cross volunteers to assist the efforts.



I received notice that support was required to assist with the recovery efforts and have just received my call to deploy to Edmonton, Alberta as a Logistics Coordinator on Monday (13 June). I am really excited to be able to be going to help out, be able to assist them to achieve their recovery efforts and be able to work in my field of expertise again!



Not that I have been particularly good at updating recently, but I will be even less for for a period of 2-3 weeks whilst I am away, so do not worry! :-)
 
The mission to Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada

2011-06-13 to 2011-06-14


After a long wknd working, it was an effort getting up again at the crack of dawn to finish packing (ugh! Yes, into my fourth year with a backpack and still I suck at it!! :-) ) and skytrain it out to the airport.

I was quite excited to meet up with my fellow Vancouver Red Cross Volunteers - Andrew, Dilpreet, and Motoi as we boarded our Air Canada flight direct to Edmonton, Alberta.

It is SO long since I have flown a &apos;real&apos; airline, and not the budget varieties as we were spoilt with personal entertainment systems in the back of the chairs as well as a snack and drink before about an hour twenty later we touched down in our neighbouring province, Alberta.

Our taxi took us right to the Edmonton Red Cross Office, a perfect location right in the centre of downtown as we were warmly welcomed, signed in, had our orientation and inductions, met the relevant people and were immediately put to work running around attempting to solve some minor transportation issues.

It was funny, I had to call someone who I didn&apos;t know to tell them this minor storm in a teacup. Someone else picked up the phone and after the go ahead explained it to them. After a pause I was told &apos;I&apos;m not really sure what she is trying to achieve by this?&apos; to which point I replied something like &apos;you and me both!!!&apos; &apos;just running in circles it seems!&apos;. Upon hanging up I asked his name again. At which point he replied, and followed it up with &apos;head of recovery operations.&apos; oops. There was no comeback. the damage was done. paying out one of the senior staff members to the boss! He then replied that he was looking forward to meeting me.... And we hung up. Massive foot in mouth go on! :-)

After a very long day getting up at 4:30am, almost 12 hours later I departed for my hotel, the Holiday Inn Express, conveniently located across the intersection!

The rooms were so nice! Our own rooms! And Individual balconies, the world&apos;s most comfortable beds, big tv&apos;s with cable, balconies, fridge, coffee machines and amazing shower and toiletries. It was like a luxury holiday!! We had really scored with the accomodation!

Yes...A bit different to the army deployments...! 

The Red Cross really tries to look after their volunteers and we get provided our three meals a day, transportation and accomodation so even though we don&apos;t get paid, at least we are not out of pocket!

We quickly walked around checking out downtown Edmonton.... But not much there! Both the streets (north/south) and avenues (east/west... I think I have that around the right way!) are labelled as numbers so it was 100th street at 102nd avenue to explain locations! Quite the confusing mouthful!

The city is quite sparse, spread out, all concretety and grey and gloomy and depressing!! We kind of likened it to Burnaby in B.C! Sorry people from there! 

After wandering and not really finding much to entertain us we tried another gloomy pub before coming to the &apos;pint&apos;, a pub with a nice atmosphere and heaps of big screens so we could watch the hockey! The four of us headed there, along with Alex, a volunteer from Vancouver I had worked with before and another volunteer, Leila. 

Unfortunately it was another disappointing loss, but at least we got to try buffalo burgers!!! Delicious! Lean and tasty and good!!! :-)

The weather was crazy too! I have no idea what happened or where it suddenly whipped up from as the intense winds flying debris everywhere and dust enveloped the city. Popping outside to meet Alex I was whipped in the head from my jacket, pushed over and eyes full of dirt and grit. Crazy!!! And then it was gone. What the?!!

Another thing about the province that makes it look so different is that cars only have licence plates on the back! The front is entirely blank like a very committed licence plate thief has been out all night!

Another thing i was amazed at were power outlets at the base of each tree along the side of the roads. I was wondering about them when it was pointed out to me the power cords dangling from the front of cars. It gets so cold in the winter, cars need to be plugged in so they dont freeze!!! Crazy!!

In line with this, the city map also highlights all the underground tunnels connecting things so you never have to see the gloom of day during the winter!!  


The other brilliant thing about Alberta is that there is Only a 7% tax, instead of the 12% we pay in B.C. So everything seems so much cheaper! So good!


We all totally crashed out early and packed up the next morning for a delicious buffet breakfast... Complete with a Pancake machine?!?!!! Yup!! 

And off to the office to meet the staff and head of operations before we jumped in the shuttles and headed 3 hours north. The entire way one super super flat and straight road across the prairies to Slave Lake where we were to be working for our deployment.

I was working as the logistics supervisor and wasn&apos;t exactly sure what I was in for, but was excited!


20 mins out of slave lake we began to see the beginnings of burnt. Trees and forest on the sides of the roads entirely black and gone or still precariously standing in s funny orange colour from the retardants they dropped in the water from the helicopters.

It was also odd to see signs all along the way to places like Athabasca, Westlock, Grande
Prairie, Widewater, names that were so familiar to me after having worked in the call centre and registering evacuees from these areas or places that reception centres were set up.

And the Rain! It just never stopped!

And into the deep end again as we arrived at Slave Lake Community College on Main St where the operation was based out of. We followed the Red Cross signs to meet up with our fellow workers and ate lunch in the college cafeteria that had just reopened that week.  

We were shown to the daycare centre where the case workers were doing their business and then outside the main building to a small room where I was to be located with the recovery manager, HR, finance, I.T. and community liaison. Turns out it was previously their gym!

And straight into it! The person I replaced left and I began the steep learning curve of how the job works and how the Red Cross operates!

I was given enough things to do to create a full two page things to do list as I prepared to get busy!

And busy the right word as we ended up working until 11 that night! 15 hour day. Wow! A while since I have done one of them!

The accomodation where we were staying was about 5km from our offices. It is a site called ATCO Camp, Slave Lake and it is a huge connection of ATCO huts!!! Again just opened less than three weeks ago!

It is an entire camp set up in ATCO huts that can fit over a 100 people, full of contractors putting the town back together and disaster volunteers. Basically a series of ATCO huts forming a super long corridor with huts for rooms coming off either side of it. They were all new and pretty decent... A double bed, sink, desk, chair, cupboard, drawers and flatscreen cable tv!! Not bad!!! And a bathroom to share between two which was pretty good!!

So there were several of these complexes with about 40 rooms per complex, a connection of five big containers for the kitchen and dining hall, and an office.

The only hiccup was the fact that it was a quagmire! The ground that was once dirt now became a slippery slidy up to shin deep muddy watery mess making it extremely difficult to get anywhere in the camp. The good news is that they did build wooden boadwalks to enable us to get around... Bad news is there was only one connecting bridge so we had to walk the distance of the entire camp to cross to the next boadwalk to get to our room locations! Too funny!! 


When we entered the cafeteria and dining hall huts we were required to take off our muddy dirty shoes and wear these plasticy paper water resistant booties to cover our feet and keep the food area clean. It was too funny to watch everyone walking around the camp with these giant bright White booties to try and save their shoes!!

The mess was amazing. So a series of about five huts all joined together jorizontally with a doorway cut out into the next. At one end of the first was a giant flatscreen tv with cable, the next a giant fridge full of all kinds of drinks and desserts, the next sandwiches and more snacks, the next salad and fruit, then salad bat, condiments and hot drinks and finally you arrived at the hot food service area complete with all kinds of bread and cereal! It was open 24 hours so you could just go whenever and get whatever you felt like to eat. And so many options! For example in home made biscuits alone there were individually wrapped portians of Ginger, choc chip, oat and raisin and some kind of White choc nut!!! Then slices, cakes, pies, puddings, tarts, muffins..... Everything you can think of!!!

The next morning we jumped in our Red Cross vehicles and headed the 6km back to the college to work. And the rain continued!

And we continued! So basically our headquarters is based in the main office in Edmonton and we are a forward outreach team. Personnel affected by the fires are coming in and booking apointments and the caseworkers are assessing their needs and issuing vouchers for them to go to stores to obtain items essential for their basic needs to allow them to begin to regain their dependance and return to some sort of new normality. As the logistics supervisor I set up agreements with suppliers to take the vouchers, look at our requirements and create purchase orders with organisations and purchase items to ensure they have the items they need to do their job, i.e. Tables, chairs, stationery, or place requests with facilities at the college or back to Edmonton for large items like phones or computers. I also manage our vehicle fleet, paperwork, fuel cards, taskings and stores in our warehouse we can distribute that have been donated and also coordinate requirements for the outreach teams that go out into the isolated communities that have been affected. And ensure everyone gets fed and..... too much to list! But that&apos;s basically it in a nutshell mainly I guess, but it involves me running around like a crazy person daily as things come up to fix and organise constantly! I am really enjoying it though!   

And then.... 50mm of rain fell in one day and the river, just near us rose 1.5m. We were now preparing for having to activate for possible flooding. I couldn&apos;t believe it! This town had certainly been through enough already!

Our camp did not like the rain either!!
It was getting more and more boggy and more and more difficult to enter! The water was almost up to one boadwalk, lapping at it&apos;s edges and threatening to flood it! Luckily a truck had arrived and was craning massive boardwalks over the heavy traffic areas go allow us to actually get around! 


That night we had rushed out of the office on time in order to get back to the mess to watch the Stanley Cup final, the biggest most important game of the National (ice) Hockey League, my local team the Vancouver Canucks were playing in. Unfortunately it did not go well as I will write about in my next blog and unfortunately our early planned night was spent up late watching the aftermath! 

The next day we took a quick drive around the affected areas of town. About 1/3 of the town was burnt and as we drove in around the fenced off areas, it looked like some kind of post apocolyptic war zone. Everything was flattened, just some shells of cars or other items remaining in the grey and black ash. Blocks and blocks as far as you could see it was all just gone. It came so quickly that people had no notice, they had no time to grab anything and had to run on foot as their cars were already alight. It is unbelieveable and absolutely amazing that nobody died. Yet randomly in the middle there would be one childs toy left unburnt and bright, a car just scorched or one house the fire totally jumped. It was crazy. These houses were all damaged in some way - mainly totally melted or singed along the sides, but otherwise intact and standing.

The city had come up with a fantastic way to quickly ensure the residents were able to get facilities back when it was finally safe to return. Different coloured pieces of brightly coloured paper said on one side &apos;phone needed&apos;, &apos;gas needed&apos; or &apos;power needed&apos;, and they stuck these in their windows. Once the service was connected, they turned them around to say &apos;done&apos;. That way driving down the street it was quick and easy to establish who needed what and where. 


The people here are so amazing, strong, generous and helpful. It is such a lovely town. Everywhere you guy people smile at you, all the emergency services wave and people judt come and say thankyou which is so nice. 

I was carrying a heavy box of supplies out of Staples and all the cars stopped so I could walk across the road to the parking lot. As I attempted to open the door a lady ran over to me, opened it and helped me load the vehicle. She just wanted to say thanks for the Red Cross guys who had gone into Staples and brought out bottles of water for them when they had evacuated with nothing. It was so sweet of her and make me feel very proud to be part of the organisation.

Unfortunately the rain was not stopping and we managed to acquire gumboots for everyone in the team. I have never seen people so happy as we all took pictures and proudly wore them around. So happy to now be able to get to our accomodation!!!

 
Game 7, The Stanley Cup Final... And Vancouver riots. Canada UPDATED!!

2011-06-15 to 2011-06-16


Game 7! The Stanley Cup!! After months of playoffs and 40 years waiting for diehard fans it was here! 

The buzz was electric! People were so proud and excited. Others had hitchiked from far away places such as Winnipeg... 2296km... to be a part of it!

Cars were decorated, homes, businesses, people, dogs!!

The city put out giant screens and closed the city to traffic so people could participate in the moment. Crowds of 100 000 were expected.

Ads on Craigslist.ca were offering people $15 p/hour to line up for Stanley Cup tickets for 12 hours! It was big! It was game on!!! 


And then.

We lost.

3 stabbings 150 in hospital, 1 critical, 15 burned cars, and dozens more flipped, many bins and other matter set alight, shops the entire length of Granville st broken windows and looted, black smoke rising from the city, fights, bottles, rocks and molitov cocktsils thrown, breaking down street signs and mobs turned on and attacked those that tried to stand up to them.

9 police officers also injured- one needing 14 stitches and others with concussion. The riot squad, police dogs and horses as well as tear gas. So sad.

Five hours of rioting and millions of dollars worth of damage.


I felt so sick as I watched poor Boston fans get set upon by gangs and beaten to the ground, and more sickening footage of the same thing happening to someone trying to stop people looting a Granville St store, or a guy trying to protect his car. 

Hundreds of items also turned up on craigslist (online trading post) as &apos;brand new&apos; with &apos;tags still attached&apos; the following day. I just hope there are enough resources in the police department to follow up and catch them all.

There are no words to portray how disgusted, embarassed and ashamed I was of my adopted city. Just yesterday I was proudly displaying my Canucks shirt and declaring the city my home. Today I am nothing more than embarassed.

The only two good things to happen were the police set up a facebook page where you can anonymously post pictures and identify the people within them causing the damage so they can be arrested by the police. I just had a look and there are thousands of photos and video&apos;s and their names posted. Several have already been fired from their jobs so very glad the public shaming is working!!!

More than 100 have already been arrested, here&apos;s to finding them!


But then the following morning dawned and over 12 000 disgusted fans headed downtown to clean up the city. Armed with gloves, brooms and garbage bags, within a few hours the city had returned to a state of normality and able to function again. It was so nice to see the city band together after what had happened and try and recliam it again.

Meanwhile around, people were doing random acts of kindness, i watched some friends from couchsurfing on a &apos;Free hugs&apos; campaign in Vancouver on the local news in Alberta.

A Police car parked on the roadside was literally covered in hundreds of sticky notes by passerby&apos;s apologising and saying thanks for their efforts. as a local blog said &apos;It all began when the VPD parked their car on Granville to help with the Clean up effort. When they returned, the car was covered in post it notes... The officers received a round of applause and cheers.&apos;

The boards being used to board up all the broken windows were covered in notes of apology, home made posters and heartfelt messages from local citizens.

I wasn&apos;t in Vancouver, but was following it so closely I felt like I was! I think the pictures say it all!!

 
Life in Slave Lake, Alberta

2011-06-17 to 2011-07-20


To give you an even better perspective, the disaster that occured in Slave Lake was massive, the biggest disaster of this type ever seen here, and topped only in scale by the amount of money (converted to today&apos;s scale) spent (1.2 billion verses 700 million to date i read somewhere) by ice storms in the eastern provinces years earlier. 

We had a &apos;celebrity&apos; visit to tour the areas affected and raise the profile further. It was the Canadian Bachelorette Gillian Harris (who also hosts Extreme makeover), and her visit, combined with benefit concerts which well known artists volunteered their time to participate in, it was fantastic to see the generosity of Canadians raising so much money to help the people affected.

In addition, it is expected that Prince William and Kate will stop over here next week as a part of their Canadian tour. Gutted that I will just miss them! But so fantastic for the community!!


We were all starting to get quite tired, working generally ten hour days, but often 12, to then head to our trailers, crash and then up to begin again. We didn&apos;t mind though as we were happy to be there and as rotations are 2-3 weeks you can work hard for the shorter period of time and then you are replaced before you burn out. 


Another upside of my job, setting up supplier agreements with local businesses, I was getting the opportunity to see the town, driving around finding the stores I needed and getting the opportunity to chat with locals along the way. It was also really sad in some places where I would try and call with no answer and then drive out to find it was no longer there from the fires.

My first time really driving again in several years though and it definately took some time before I got that reverse park down!! Not that I was particularly ever good at it anyway! :-) 

But it was so lovely everywhere you went within the town there were posters saying thank you to all the emergency support services &apos;for risking your life to save our town&apos;, and many other beautiful sentiments of gratitude.


After the constant rain and flood alerts we had been placed on, we were wondering if the sun would ever return! But there it was one afternoon!!! Sunshine!!

And we made the most of it, walking the 6km back to camp, which was awesome to be able to finally get some form of exercise, but rough walking over the rocky pot holed mud covered roads with the cars! 

We were also quite far north so we had a fair bit of light... Well when it wasn&apos;t raining anyhow! :-) it was still light at 11pm and sun rose at 4! It was crazy! We never ever saw darkness the entire time we were there!

It looks like the Red Cross will be in Slave Lake for two years so it would be amazing to be able to return in winter, see the progress, help out again and be here in a time when it is -30 degrees and only about 4 hours of daylight!!

On Saturdays the College cafeteria we have our lunch at during the week is closed and so a local Mennonite family offered to bring us in some food. We were expecting maybe a pasta bake or the like, but the entire family pulled up and arrived with a feast! Fluffy fresh, non fried rice (yay!), mashed potatoes, vegies, salad, fresh bread, an amazing soy onion gravy and real chicken for us all!!! AND a massive fresh strawberry cheesecake!!! Amazing! It felt like the most delicious food we had ever eaten as we tucked into the home cooked feast. Amazing!!  And sooo lovely of them!

And Sunday!! We were all super excited to have a day off to relax as we slept in and tried to catch up on our beauty sleep! After a leisurely wakeup and breakfast, fellow Vancouverites Johnny, Alex, Motoi and I hit the road to explore!! 

We first checked out Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park, which unfortunately had a lot of closed off roads. We then luckily stumbled across a road that magically took us all the way down to the lake and it was stunning! A small path and a sandy patch about 20 metres or so wide, it was like a private beach! The water looked amazing too, the lake stretching as far as the eye could see and strangely giving the impression that it was higher than the sand in front of it. Bizarre!

 We spent ages here just taking photos, wading through the water in our gumboots and enjoying the private serenity, before the mosquitoes became too much for the others (even i got bitten once and i never get bitten by bugs post malaria!!) and we hit the road again to explore further,

As we continued along, the roads became worse, more and more so as we bumped along the really uneven roads with potholes filled water... or mud i should probably say!

The effect of the rains was super noticeable as the rivers and small waterways were totally swamped and were starting to overflow and encroach on the road as we continued further on our journey.

And then it happened. We had kind of been waiting for it all day. Wheels turning..... no moving. We were stuck in the mud!!! We all jumped out and lucky for gumboots as we stomped straight into the mud and pushed the car until we were clear! And only mildly dirty! Score! I cant say as much for the car though, with mud splattered as high as the roof!


We did a tour around the communities in the local area who were also all evacuated and suffered damage from the fires. A lot of the communities are situated on the edge of Slave Lake as well and are really pretty with stunning views. But still, a lot of burn out homes, business, forests and a lot more damaged places.

We headed through the tiny towns of Wide water, Canyon Creek and then to Kinuso which was a really stunning - a town that looked exactly like what you would picture the &apos;wild west&apos; to look like with big wide, empty streets, the flat storefronts, a big field with a giant grain tower in it, nothing else to be seen for miles, except the railway tracks heading off forever! Super cool! 

We followed the signs to Spruce point park as we thought that sounded cool, but little did we know we would be driving on random backstreets for over half an hour to find it! It turning out to be a RV park anyway so quite funny, but pretty to drive through and a lovely location on the water there as well.

Headed back onto the highway we started towards another little town called Driftpile where the North county fair was being held. We were attempting to use the GPS on Johnny&apos;s phone which sent us down a dodgy looking dirt road with a sign to the &apos;Driftpile first nations&apos;. We drove for about 15 minutes, but the road did not look like one that would be used for fair access and so texted our colleagues who were already there to ask if it was a &apos;dodgy dirt road near the first nations sign&apos;. In the meantime we turned around, thinking we were wrong. &apos;Yes!&apos; The answer came back ! Oh oh! Another u turn and we were back on the little dirt road and heading into the forest again... until the road peetered out and left us nowhere!! The GPS still said we had to continue! soh! Impossible!

We headed back to the highway to see the next road along... ah ha! the same sign we had seen before and a dirt road in to the fair.... I guess we should have been more specific with our definitions of dirt road when asking our colleagues for directions!! :-)

The road was busy with traffic going in and out and quite muddy... we were directed to the parking area and wow!! I don&apos;t know if i have ever seen so much mud!! The fair go-ers were all decked out in gumboots and were striding across the paddocks shin deep in mud and there was a local tractor pulling the vehicles out as they became bogged... so we decided to err on the side of caution and turn around before we also joined the crowds of those who had became stuck!

After a great day we decided to head off back to our trailer camp, but not before encountering some deer in the forests along the roadside. I love the different animals you see along the sides of the road in different places around the world!


And back! Ah home sweet home. Our accomodation was fantastic, but we had to keep laughing... As amazing as it was, we all had stories each morning of what had woken us up during the night. There was a massive generator on one side of the building running the camp (thankfully not my side!!!) that the people in the &apos;odd&apos; numbered rooms had to deal with, the amazingly loud industrial strength bathroom fans that shut off 12 minutes after you turned off the light (soneone timed it!!), the thud of the washing machines finishing or the buzzer on the dryers, and then one day out of the blue the vents in rooms came on! With no way to turn them off, there was a vicious cycle of 4 mins on, 4 mins off in the loudest airconditioning you have ever heard in your life! And conveniently one right next to your pillow. So loud your head echoes!!! And you have to turn up the heat too! If you don&apos;t adjust, it chills your room to a delightful two degrees and actually freezes water bottles next left to the vent. Unbelieveable!!! Too funny!!!

The camp definitely looks after us all though - We have been eating so much food here!!! With 24 hour food of every variety you could think of we just never stopped picking! And this evenings meal was amazing...! Steak and prawns with sauteed mushrooms and onions and baked potatoes and corn on the cob!!!! There was even more options with rice and onion rings and cream of mushroom soup to add on!!! It was amazing too, being a work camp I kind of expected kind of tough, chewy and fatty meat, but it was so delicious and tender we all continued to stuff out faces well past the point of common sense! I even tried the pumpkin cake for dessert. Delicious!!! I am not sure how I am going to cope back home after this! I don&apos;t think I have even had a steak in probably a good 8 months since I was in Italy last year!!

And...even better - it coincided with the arrival of real cutlery, plates and plastic &apos;glasses&apos;. You have never seen anyone so excited about not having to eat off throw away disposable plastics again!!

 
Farewell Slave Lake, Alberta WORK IN PROGRESS

2011-06-21 to 2011-06-29


You have probably seen on the news that Prince Willam and Kate visited Slave Lake today! (06 Jul) Gutted I missed them - they even went to where the Red Cross is operating out of, but it is so fantastic that it has given the people of the town something to look forward to and enjoy and even further raised the profile of the town and the disaster and hopefully assists with fundraising and beginning to get the town back on its feet further.

 

Ongoing... I will finish this blog tomorrow! I have three days here to occupy! :-)

 
Home Sweet Home! Canada Day coincidences, Lacrosse, Grouse Grind and back to life in Van! UPDATED!!

2011-06-30 to 2011-07-08


After my early morning wake up I was quite tired so lay down for a quick nap before meeting my friend Dana for her birthday. I woke up with a jolt knowing instantly something was wrong, checking my watch to see 5.55pm. What?!?!? My alarm was supposed to go off at 5.30?!!? Quickly grabbing it the reason became suddenly apparent. Set for 5.30am not 5.30pm. Doh!!!!! I ran like a crazy man, showered, ate and powered to the bus stop just as the bus arrived. Sweaty and gross... But success!!!! :-)

We were watching the movie &apos;Bridesmaids&apos; and it is brilliant! Seriously hilarious the whole way! It made me realise too though that I had actually not watched a movie in about three years!!!! Crazy! Ah the life if a backpacker!!!

It was awesome to catch up with my friend Dana though after being away for three weeks and then celebrate Canada Day the next day, July 1st.

It was a day of coincidences! Being new to the city, Dana and I could not believe the amount of people we ran into! Firstly, on Thursday a girl I worked with at the events company drove randomly past me on her motorbike and stopped for a chat. Then another girl from the same company was in the front row of our movie. Someone else I met was in the same class as Dana&apos;s good friend we had watched the movie with the night before, and Katrina was randomly at Canada place where I was playing Lacrosse. We dropped by my house, no one was home, and then ran into my flat-mate Darren at a hostel on Granville St! Katrina then got a text from a friend asking if she wanted to catch up... who then turned out to be Dana&apos;s new room mate! And so it continued! Dana walking through the crowded streets ran into our good friend Rahul who we were trying to meet up with, and then as we headed out for Sushi, Rahul&apos;s friend was there that Dana had previously randomly met and not known the connection! Ridiculous!! Small world!!!

Well I guess that is a summary of my day! But it is Canada Day so it deserves more time! So here goes! :-)

I had been asked to play lacrosse at an exhibition match at Canada place to showcase the National Sport as a part of the Canada Day celebrations. Canada actually has two official sports - Hockey (ice of course!) for winter and lacrosse for summer, but lacrosse is not very well known even though it is the national sport and originally invented by Aboriginal Canadians!

We were playing on a small field set up in an exhibition hall wearing red and blue pinnies, doing warm up drills and then a game, followed by an interactive component where all members of the public could come in and try out the game for themsevles which was good fun. We originally started playing with our regular lacrosse balls, but after the small space we were playing in proved to be a little too small and an innocent bystander was hit in the head (softly!), we switched to the softer foam balls to try and not kill anyone! :-)

 

It was so tiring running around in the exhibition hall, especially after spending almost three weeks in Slave Lake sitting in an office, but super fun and the crowd all seemed to enjoy it which was great!

 

As per my &apos;coincidences&apos; section, I ran into Katrina and then met up with Dana as we walked around the thousands of people out enjoying themselves before heading to my place to do a quick change and then walk on over to Granville Island to enjoy the beautiful summers day that had finally arrived! Sitting in the sun, we watched a couple in matching clothes saunter around on the marina berths in front of us as we watched wondering if something was about to happen. And yes! a circus! And so the moral of the story - people in matching clothes = a circus!! :-) They were actually hilarious, doing a comedy sketch on their sailboat berthed in the marina for all the crowds to circus music, and as it progressed turned into an acrobatic show! Awesome!

We then met up with some more &apos;coincidence&apos; friends of friends and enjoyed the afternoon sitting in a park in the sun, looking particularly Canadian with our matching maple leaf face tattoos!

Before long it was Sushi time we decided and headed to a feast downtown where we split 22 pices of sushi, plus soup and salad for just 6.25!! less than $4 for a delicious sushi feast!! bargain!!!


And with perfect timing it was the moment to head back to Canada Place to watch the firewors display with the rest of the city! We squished in as the colours exploded in the sky above us with a massively awesome simultaneous finale and the beautiful backdrop of the sails of Canada Place and the North Shore behind. Beautiful!

Saturday dawned another perfect day as I jumped on my bike and headed off to fo some chores and meet the gang at Stanley Park where Rahul had joined a cricket team. It was the perfect day to laze around until the cricket became far too boring for us.... nothing to do with the team... just all to do with the fact the game goes forever!! And so walked through Staney Park through to downtown where we ended up at David Lam Park in Yaletown, conveniently just down the road from me where there was a massive free festival as a part of the jazz festival! - ( ( http://www.coastaljazz.ca/venue/david_lam_park_stage_free  ) ! It was awesome as we wandered around the giant marquee and blanketed ground that was conveniently placed down for us to sit on... even if it was a little gross and wet in parts! Don&apos;t want to know what happened there! :-)

We listened to some awesome music before the rain set in, but still people just put up their umbrellas and rainjackets and enjoyed the music! The atmosphere was amazing as darkness descended, lights from the apartments around glittered in the sky and slowly people just started tapping their feet or swaying to the music, and before you knew it everyone just up dancing around and getting totally into it!!! It was so cool!!


Sunday dawned a little overcast, but we were committed!! Rahul, Corey, Dana and I met up at Waterfront to catch the Seabus to North Vancouver and the bus to Grouse Mountain where we were to attempt for the first time the famous Grouse Grind! -  http://www.grousemountain.com/grousegrind - or &apos;Mother Nature&apos;s Stairmaster&apos;! It is 2.9km, 853m elevation gain  and 2830 stairs!

 

It was my first time to Grouse Mountain, one of the North Shore mountains that is a popular ski hill in winter and super accesible from Vancouver, just about half an hour on the public bus from North Van. It is also famous for having a zip line and the &apos;eye of the wind&apos;, a glass viewing platform on one of the wind turbines which is quite cool... but expensive!

 We jumped off the bus and followed the steady procession of hikers of all ages and all walks of life - we saw a child of 5 and up to retiree&apos;s joining the path! It was busy, you just kind of joined the line and started walking!! SO many stairs!! It was crazy!!! Very tough walk, but fun nonetheless and we made it in about 1hr 45.... so a cross between novice and beginner according to the website! We did have a lot of rests though :-).

At the top there is a nice view back to downtown Vancouver and a restaurant where you can relax the afternoon away. Walking around the mountain there are also various attractions, one of which we saw was a Lumberjack show,.... and snow!! Still everywhere!! Crazy!!

It is steep and slippery and not recommended to walk down (thanks goodness!) and so we brought tickets for the skyride - gondola - down to the base of the mountain. It was an awesome day, but I must say it gave me the craziest allergies! I have never in my life had allergies until I moved to Vancouver and suffered them really badly on Vancouver Island at Easter. And totday they were back in full force!! Streaming eyes I could barely open so Corey gave me his allergy tablets... which proceeded to put me into a zombie like state where I splet the entire way back on the bus, seabus and then went straight home to bed.... at like 6.30pm!!! I think the non drowsy tablets are in order for next time!!!

 

Well the upside of not having money to buy a transit ticket is that you get really really fit! I think I have cycled about a trillion kilometres doing my normal everyday chores around the city since my return from Alberta so it has been fantastic to be out and enjoying the beautiful weather also.

I was fortunate enough to walk into a temp job when I returned, so yay for having money to eat! :-). I like the opportunity temp work provides as you get to see so many different places and different work environments to see what you like. I figure that the amount of people you meet too means that sooner or later you are going to get talking to someone who knows of a job in logistics going! :-) Also, it is nice to do something different all the time, and get some new experiences. And if it is really really REALLY boring... at least you are only there for a short time!

The office that I am in at the moment is right in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to the West End and on the 35th floor, As you can imagine, it has windows 360&apos;; around and has the most amazing views over the city and water!

I did sign up wit this agency over two months ago and this is my first placement so they have taken their sweet time with it that&apos;s for sure though! Lucky I didn&apos;t hold my breath! :-)

The race to Chetwynd! Way Northern B.C. UPDATED

2011-07-11 to 2011-07-16

I received a phone call asking me if i could deploy today to Chetwynd to assist with the Red Cross relief efforts for the flooding there. So quick pack, and am awaiting my ticket confirmation to head to the airport and head up to way northern B.C. for the next ten days!!



No sooner than I had settled back into life at home than i was called up asking if i could deploy!



So I had a call on friday wondering if I was free to head back to Slave Lake or Edmonton on Monday. But I decided I needed a bit of a break from that location. Monday morning my phone rang asking if I was still available and to pack a bag for a provincial response. Further details would be available after the planning conference.



I quickly unpacked my backpack from my weekend camping trip, repacked my bag for a deployment, finished a few loose ends, got my flight confirmation and was on my way to the airport!



As someone laughingly told me, I was certainly seeing Canada through its disasters!



Northern B.C. was flooded, sewerage was backed up, the rains were continuing, roads were out, homes were evacuated, landslides were happening, homes were lost, power was out, black moud was starting, people were cut off and help was needed from the Red Cross!



Over 150 mm of rain had fallen in the region 24 June to early July, 128mm in less than a week! It was broadcast that approximately 200 homes were impacted.



At one stage, water along the pine river rose at a rate of 15cm an hour. Crazy!



We were just in a small 52 seat plane for the one hour and ten minute flight to Fort St John, way way Northern B.C.



The flight was stunning! We took off and headed over the Rockies, beautiful rows upon rows of snow capped mountains as far as the eye could see, the first line literally coming straight down into the water.



We could see the massive Peace river as we flew towards Fort St John and the super super green rolling hills. I expected the country to be much flatter so that was interesting to find.



Arriving into Fort St John, I saw the world&apos;s fastest baggage carousel in action. For serious! You had to stand back! Hmmmm maybe that is their ploy to stop people crowding!! :-) And was met by a Red Cross volunteer, Frank, and vehicle to take me on the two and a half hour journey to Chetwynd. Basically on the same longitude as Copenhagen and northern Scotland and in line with the pan handle of Alaska to give you an idea how far up it was!





We began our journey on the Alaska highway, (yes, goes all the way through to Alaska!) as Frank told me was built by US servicemen during the second world war to be able to provide support to the apparent imminent invasion of Japanese forces along the US/ Canadian coastline!



The Peace River Dam also provides the bulk of the electricity to the entire surrounding regions and is massive! We passed it en route and it is phoenominally huge! Really awesome!



We saw several deer along the way grazing at the side of the road and then two Moose! Super cool!



I also got to see the cute little town of Hudsons Hope that we passed en route.



The &apos;creeks&apos; we passed over on bridges along the highway were more churned up brown rivers with super strong currents than creeks.



And we came across dozens of witches hats warning us of road wash outs. Although having heard of these constantly, it was the first time I had actually seen them! In this instance the water became too much for the drains underneath the road and the water came across the road, lifting the edge section of the bitumen and as more and more water came through, it continued lifting the bitumen, getting underneath and literally washing the bitumen away with the water, leaving large gaps in the road.



Arriving safely we met the rest of the team and headed to the Westwind hotel in Chetwynd where I was booked in for my stay and settled into the super comfy room.



I was just there for a night before I took over a fellow volunteers room at the Pomeroy Suites and Inn.and wow that place was amazing! We had a seperate lounge room, full kitchenette, en suite with super deep bath, one of those super awesome fake log gas fires and two flat screen tv&apos;s! One in the bedroom and one in the lounge! Sweeeeeet! It was awesome!! I may not go home! :-)



We worked 8am-8pm each day at the Chetwynd Recreation Centre working in the Red Cross Resilience Centre to assist the people who had been impacted by the flood.



We had an Information Line phone people called us on for assistance and advice and had people come in to visit us so we could complete needs assessments to assist with their basic needs if required, the provincial disaster assistance forms (DFA), water bottles from Northern Health for well water testing, clean up kits to assist in their homes (garbage bin, pail, cleaner, gloves, masks, broom, mop), and lots of various information sources.



We also had the local radio station, Peace FM, come out and film us &apos;in action&apos; so am trying to get hold of that footage! :-)



It was really interesting to be working as a Case worker on a small team of five so you got a chance to really interact with the people that came in and do a variety of different things each day.



We also got the opportunity to do some House visits which were really fantastic as well as visiting people in different areas that had been badly affected, such as in Moberly Lake. I wrote a story on a visit we did out there that was sent to public affairs, so hopefully it gets published and I can post it here soon!



One bad thing to happen though was confirmation that my blood is now attractive to mosquitoes again. Doh!!! After I had malaria I didn&apos;t get bitten by any bug for coming onto over seven months, but alas this super power appears to be gone as the swarms of mosquitoes breeding in the excesses of water attacked me left, right and centre, even somehow past my jeans as I stood out at Moberly Lake. Oh well! Good whilst it lasted! Hopefully this means I am better then!! :-)



And did i mention how awesome our hotel was?! One night i came home from work to find massive signs saying &apos;Guest appreciation night&apos; and followed the arrows to find dozens of boxes of pizza in the dining room for everyone in the hotel! Random!! But awesome!



We also had a farmers market right outside of the office one afternoon in the Rec Centre. It was so nice seeing all the home made goodies and everyone out!



The community of Chetwynd really welcommed and supported us and it was so nice to be there. The people were all so friendly and helpful and all so resilient working through their situations stoicly.



And although the waters were receeding, the weather continued to be grey and gloomy and the rain continued, so I really hope it lets up and gives everyone a break soon!



With our job complete we received our instructions to close down and so began to transfer the areas of responsibility, files and pack up!



And mission in location complete! The next morning we loaded up the remainder of our stores and headed away from Chetwynd Rec Centre for the last time.



As we drove the highway out of town, just 100m past our hotel we passed a sign- &apos;have you got fuel? Next gas 148km&apos;. We were certainly heading out! :-)



It is called the &apos;highway of tears&apos; after so many people have gone missing from here. I believe they have found something like 19 bodies, but there are still dozens more people unaccounted for from the area.



It was crazy as we drove looking at the devestation around us. There were  landslides on the sides of us and damage and debris everywhere we looked. Sides of the roads had just fallen away leaving gaping holes right next to us, often into rivers below.



There were witches hats and construction teams everywhere attempting to fix the damage. We pulled up to a halt on one of the worst sections and settled in for a wait. Cars lined up behind us as we jumped out for a leg stretch and impromptu picnic as we waited.



We were jolted out of our chat by the construction chick yelling something urgently as we jumped in our cars just as the card from the other end came through. Luckily we were about fourth in lone so we could see everything that happened and were right at the front of the queue as we headed off after just 15 or 20 mins.



Even better, the next large construction site we arrived at just as the cars on our side started to move and headed straight through. Score!!





Luckily the rain was beginning to clear and around us as far as the eye could see were stunningly beautiful supergreen hills covered in trees!



We came across a section of a mountain range called the tabletop mountains and we were driving through the Rockies!! Amazing!!!



Next stop was Pine Pass as we jumped out to admire the gorgeous view of the Pine River as it snaked its way through the mountains.



And the views continued to amaze us! We drove past the massive McLeod Lake and the Red Rocky Lake before we were stunned to witness a black bear run across the road less than a hundred metres in front of us!!!!! Awesome!!!!





The journey only took us about 4 hours 45 mins which was fantastic as it is usually a four hour drive, but had taken someone six hours less than a week earlier due to all the washouts and construction.



We arrived into Prince George, the capital and largest town within Northen B.C., and it was quite the shock to see the extent of large stores on the outskirts as we entered. I had only been away a week in small country towns and already this city looked huge to me!



We headed to the Red Cross Office to unpack and debrief before my lovely friend Joann and her husband Ron came to pick me up! I had met Joann whilst I was in Slave Lake with the Red Cross last month and she just happened to live in Prince George where we were debriefing! Sweet!



Joann and Ron are super amazing people and took me on a tour of town, the pretty park overlooking the town and then up the hill on the other side to UNBC (the university of northern British Columbia) which were both awesome as you looked out over the town, super green trees and beautiful mountains in the distance.



The main industry here are the mills which we could see from the hill, and we also got a great view over the Fraser River that had also recently flooded with the constant heavy rains here too.



The town is also a transport hub with the main north/south and east/west routes also meeting here. It was interesting that I had noticed the sprawling city as I had entered as Joann and Ron told me how it was a struggle to keep the downtown core alive with the large box stores opening up outside the town for the bigger space and taking away business from the centre.



We headed to their beautiful home for a quick drink before heading downtown for an amazing dinner. We ate at a really nice place called &apos;The twisted cork&apos;, where the staff were all super friendly and the food delicious!! Mmmm wild salmon!!!!! Thank you guys, it was a fantastic afternoon/evening!!!



Alas all too soon it was time to head to the airport to meet the rest of the crew and board our Air Canada flight back to Vancouver. Alas the millionaire hockey player/ lumberjack named Chuck (depending on who is telling the story!) was not sitting next to me again, but the odds must be getting shorter for sure! :-)



It was a shaky flight on the little dash 8 through the clouds but we arrived safe and sound an hour and a half later. Home Sweet Home... and Sleep!! yay! :-)

Home Sweet Home! Ahhh for 5 days! Vancouver, Canada

2011-07-18 to 2011-07-21

Well... the worst thing about living in Vancouver is the risk you take each time you walk on a marked crossing here! Just putting it out there for everyone who is visiting to be careful! Mum! Betty! Stacey! :-) So with my limited time in the city and limited people I know, I am aware of at least 4 people that have been hit by cars and seriously injured crossing with the white man (... the walk sign here!) in the past year.



Cars just don&apos;t look for the pedestrians before they bowl through at full speed. I have been literally nudged by two cars and had another two have to screech on brakes to avoid hitting me. And that is just ones that have directly impacted me. I have seen countless more near misses from the safety of the sidewalk.



I got home to find a new maintenance guy working in our building and enquiring about Steven was told that he was crossing on the walk signal just a few blocks away downtown and was knocked 30 ft by a driver coming through not watching. It is so dangerous! He has been in hospital for two weeks already now and he is not in a good condition. So awful.



Don&apos;t trust those drivers out there! That is all! :-)



Now onto nicer things...!

The West Coast Trail! Vancouver Island, Canada

2011-07-22 to 2011-07-30

Well, I am off to hike the West Coast Trail!



&apos;The West Coast Trail (WCT) is a coastal wilderness component of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. It has the reputation of being on of the most grueling treks in North America. It is isolated, strenuous, physically challenging and potentially hazardous. It is also extremely rewarding due to the spectacular scenery and unique setting.



Hiking the WCT demands stamina and expertise in hiking and backcountry camping skills. Only competent backpackers should attempt the entire route. You are required to cross deep gullies on fallen trees, negotiate very steep slopes and follow an irregular, slippery trail. This is a wilderness area and it may be many hours before help can be obtained should an accident occur. All hikers should carefully evaluate their individual and group abilities before attempting the route.&apos;



The entire, authentic West Coast Trail connects the Trailhead at Pacheena Bay in the north to the Trailhead at the mouth of the Gordon River in the south. The total distance is 75 km.



Cable cars require close attention. Keep your fingers and hands away from pulleys. Be careful when getting in and out of the cars; remove packs and stay seated. Only two persons in a car at one time. Platforms can be very slippery. When entering, pull car towards yourself and have someone stabilize it as you enter and then load in the packs. Once in, let it go and gravity will move the car to the center; pull the rope until you reach the far side. Hold the rope so the car stays in place flush with the platform and carefully unload. Do not bounce or sway in the car. Never tie the cable cars up to the platforms.



It may be necessary to cross some creeks, rivers by wading. Wait for safe water levels and low tides; undo your pack hip-belt; wear running shoes or other foot protection. Do not attempt to cross Adrenaline Surge Channel. Stay on the trail proper between Logan Creek and Walbran Creek.



Think of your feet. Waterproof boots with good ankle and arch support are required. Rubber soles provide better traction on slippery surfaces than hard Vibram soles. Do not break in new boots on this hike. Sandals and running shoes are good for around camp and for river crossings only. Be able to treat blisters adequately.



High tides can make beach walking very difficult or impossible. Follow the Tide Tables and Map very carefully to avoid being trapped or cut-off. Watch also for large ocean waves and swells.



Hang your food and toiletries out of reach of animals and away from your tent. Do not cook in or near your tent. Maintain a clean, garbage-free campsite. Do not bury garbage or deposit it in outhouses.



Bears and Cougars. Hikers may encounter bears and cougars on the WCT. They are wild, potentially dangerous and demand your respect. Strong and agile bears will defend themselves, their young and their territory if they feel threatened. Cougars are predators - at the top of the food chain - and their actions are often unpredictable. Knowledge and alertness and a clean campsite can help avoid a dangerous encounter with a bear or cougar. Do not bury garbage.... pack it out! If you encounter a bear or cougar do not run or do anything to trigger an attack. Try to calmly escape to a secure place. As a last resort if attacked, try to shield yourself with an object, pack, etc.





Is how it is described on http://www.westcoasttrailbc.com/trail_guidebook_map.htm#logistics





http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/activ6a/ii.aspx is the government of Canda challenges of the west coast trail so you can see a few pictures of what we will be getting up to!!



&apos;If you are looking for a surreal experience hiking through pristine Canadian wilderness, catching beautiful vistas of both temperate rain forests, rugged coastlines and dramatic mountain peaks, then the West Coast Trail is an absolute must. Hikers will awake to misty dawns, enjoy unbelievable sunsets, cross boulders and logs over rivers, scramble up creeks, hike past waterfalls, be dwarfed by enormous trees in an old growth forest, spot whales, sea lions, minks and maybe even bears or wolves, and check out shipwrecks and other historical sites.



This unique, stunning hike with immensely varied terrain can be difficult to get one of the limited permits available every summer and costing about C$200 per person it is also the most expensive hike in Canada. Also, inclement weather even in the summer months can make for heavy packs for climbing over mossy rocks and all of those ladders. That being said, this hike is well worth both the money and the heavy pack, as no other hike in North America offers such varied scenery from forest to mountains to sea.&apos;



http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/09-02/10-best-hiking-trails-world.html - it is also rated as one of the top ten hiking trails in the world!



We have been planning and have had it booked for almost 3 months now so are all very excited and hoping for sunshine!!

Trail Time! Day 1

2011-07-22

After packing, re-packing, holding up to assess backpack weight and removing every last &apos;non essential&apos; it was ready! I was ready! And it was West Coast Trail time!!



I had my warm up walking the km or so up to the skytrain station, up the stairs and onto the train!



It was busy as I stood up and random druggie guys asked where I was going and were intrigued by the trail, asking thousands of questions and telling the whole carriage!



Finally it was Edmonds skytrain where I was meeting Ang and Keith, and Jon who kindly drove us to Tsawwassen ferry terminal to catch the ferry to Victoria, Vancouver Island.



I received my share of the food and stores, attempted to jam the ridiculously heavy and massive bag into my already heavy and full backpack and board the ferry!



We had the privilege of seeing a pod of killer whales just to the side of the ferry as we motored along, before sailing between the stunning scenery of the Gulf Islands, literally just weaving between islands of gorgeous pine trees just off either side of the boat.



About an hour and a half later we had arrived into Victoria and Shimmick (well, that&apos;s how I will spell it phonetically as it is too hard otherwise!), a friend of Keith&apos;s kindly picked us up and took us to stay at his place.



We drove through Victoria, and it was so lovely! Beautiful buildings of so many styles, and far more like Europe than the Americas!



Shimmick had kindly made up beds for all of us as we settled in to rearrange our backpacks, spread our mess everywhere and then walk the few blocks to meet the rest of our group - Link, Hoku and Billy - who were conveniently staying in a hotel just a few blocks away. Random, but perfect!



We picked up supplies and then stopped in at this cool little haunted pub &apos;The Bent Mast&apos;, carrying random items including a sleeping bag and massive jerry of fuel for the stoves. No, nothing weird here! Luckily no one looked twice at us as we sat down for a drink, enjoyed the fairy lights and awesome atmosphere and played trivial pursuit questions - Random fact of the day... What must you add to food to make it taste? Saliva&apos;! Interesting hey!



Walking home we repacked again and hit the sack ready for our big day!
 
Mud, mud mud! Victoria to Bamfield to Michigan Creek. Day 2, 0-12km...over 5 hours!

2011-07-23

It had arrived! The day we had been waiting and planning all year for!



We were about to embark on North Americas most gruelling hike! Or so we had read! :-)



Originally part of an international communication system in 1889, the original trail was constructed by telegraph linesmen. It was then improved in the early 1900&apos;s and became know as the &apos;life saving trail&apos; until modern technologies made it obsolete. Hello West Coast Trail!



It was an effort as the alarm went off at 5 something as we dragged ourselves up and Shimmick kindly drove to us the bus depot. We met the others and loaded onto the West Coast Trail Express bus! It was quite funny as the backpacks piled up inside the bus as more and more hikers joined us for the journey.



The bus left at 6.15 and it was a 6 hour journey up to Bamfield where we were to start our hike from North to South. Ang and I quickly ran up the back to stretch out and try and catch up on some sleep, but it was impossible! I had flashbacks to the bus trip from hell in Albania as I had to hold on to avoid being bounced off the seat over the crazily constantly bumpy roads. Hmm... so much for that nap! :-)



We picked up quite a few other hikers en route and stopped at an awesome little cafe at the side of the road for tasty breakfast burrito&apos;s... my first ever! It is scrambled egg, ham, cheese and salsa wrapped in a tortilla and heated. Delicious!



We continued on to bounce our way up the coast as a bear ran in front of the bus! oh oh! Guess they are around!!



Finally we arrived into Bamfield, a full bus, with someone even on the floor, and an entire wall of backpacks as high as the bus! Disembarking, we watched an extremely sorry procession of hikers pass us to get back on the bus for the trip back south... moving very slowly, all limping, looking the worse for wear and with blisters all the way up the backs of their heels. Scary!!!



We checked into the B.C. Parks hut to do our hiker registrations and attend our orientation briefing. We learnt that there were 49 evacuations to date on the trail for this season! Crazy! And that a landslide had made the first part of the beach track impassable and we were required to go inland.



The &apos;pack it in, pack it out&apos; philosophy was reinforced, where you have to carry everything you need in with you and everything out with you again.



And we learnt how to act when we encountered wolves and cougars - stare into their eyes, make yourself big and don&apos;t act like prey!&apos; Oh... and don&apos;t pat the cubs!! Just in case you wanted an angry mother bearing down on you!



And bears... same! Make lots of noise to scare them off and stand your ground. Lock up food and toiletries at night in bear lockers so you don&apos;t get unwelcome visitors ripping into your tents!



Also when going to the toilet or collecting water, you have to pair up so your buddy could stand up and scare off the animals so you weren&apos;t attacked. So much to remember! Give me the world&apos;s most dangerous snakes and spiders any day! :-)



And then the tsunami&apos;s........!!! Sure you want to do this still?!



Along the trail there are tsunami signs that you needed to follow to head inland and to high points if we saw one coming. Riiiiiiiight. And then wait to be rescued! Except there was no way to get to high points on a lot of the trail and so we were just told to climb a tree as high as we could and hold on for dear life. Oh dear!



After this inspiring speech we heard about the tide charts and how we needed to read them to be able to cross various stretches of the coastline before the high tide hit; as well as information that we would need to know for the rest of the trail.



Orientation complete, permit received and we were on our way! We had originally decided to camp at the trail head and start the hike first thing tomorrow morning, but finding out this was an extra fee we decided to hit the track straight away!



We had our first amazing lunch from the menu plan Ang had prepared, or as I preferred to call it - &apos;Ang&apos;s Gourmet Catering&apos; - multigrain bagels with cream cheese or peanut butter. Yup! On a hike! Amazing!



Repacking...again! We put on our gaiters, moaned about the 45lb&apos;s we were about to put on our backs and the excitement hit! we were off!



And we hit the first ladders just a few minutes in! Woohoo! I had been looking forward to these!! Ever tried climbing a super tall ladder with a giantly heavy backpack? Crazy! And your head is trapped in a downward position from the pack so you can&apos;t even see where you are going! But actually easier than expected as we navigated several of these before hitting our first downward one which we also survived all 60 rungs of. So much fun!



We had glimpses of amazing coastline, but were mostly inland in the forest as we stepped through mud, mud and more mud!



We were also so unbelievably lucky with our weather - the first day of sun in literally months and we had it! Soo happy!



We crossed the first of over 100 bridges on the trail and actually got about 15 of them completed during the day! Other parts we walked on boardwalks, stepping stones, and who knows what covered in mud!



Where massive trees had fallen on the trail, someone had just been through and cut a trail wide chunk out of it and wallah! Trail! The bits cut out were then used as stepping stones through the mud elsewhere on the trail.



It was funny as we started out, walking around the mud and trying to find the best way across, but by the end of the day it was just straight through the middle of shin deep mud, water and slush!



Speaking of mud... it was unbelievable! It just reminded me absolutely of the movie &apos;Kokoda&apos; where they almost lose a guy in it, it is so deep! Just like that, endless trudging of the trail, boots suctioning in as you try and walk!



We started to hear sea lions as we walked and took a side path out to the water. After just a few minutes we came across a cliff with a surge channel beneath it and about 30 sea lions sunning themselves on the rocks to our front and left! Unbelievable! We sat there and watched them play and listened to them barking. It was so cool and National Geographic like!



We also took a side tour to the first lighthouse on the trail, Panchena Point Light Station.



There were yellow kilometre signs every kilometre on the trail, but wow it felt like we walked about 10km for each one that we saw! So demoralising as we hit them to find that just 1km had passed!





It was a tough day, after having the orientation we decided to hike to the first campsite - 12km in, and about an easy 3- 3 1/2 hours we were told. Ah hem! Try over 5 hours! We didn&apos;t start until 2.20pm and so a long tough afternoon and evening until we reached our camp at Michigan Creek, tired, ready to stop, aching shoulders, wet feet and totally covered in mud.



And who was it that told me that the West Coast Trail was flat?! Liars!! :-)



We set up our tents on the beach, attempted to wash some mud off and went to a flowing creek to pump and filter water and cook dinner. We had an amazing and delicious curry rice with soy protein and cashew nuts for dinner and is was awesome! Even more so as we sat on the beach looking out and watching seals and whales frollick in the water! I definitely felt a 100 times better as we cleaned up, locked away our food and toiletries , wrapped our packs in giant garbage bags to stop the mice gnawing into them and hit the sack exhausted!



We lay in our tents on the soft sand listening to the waves crashing on the beach.... ahhh! Although we were also kind of hoping we had read the marks right and were above the hide tide line! :-)
 
More mud!Sideways boardwalks, slippery rocks&amp;a cable car! Michigan Creek-Tsusiat Falls 12-25km Day3

2011-07-24

Although I had spent the entire week prior visiting chemists for allergy advice, starting my tablets several days early, taking extra as a precaution and also eye drops, I did still get some symptoms, but luckily nothing like I had experienced on our previous hike in Washington. And my eyes were only semi puffy this morning! So grateful!



Ang&apos;s dad had also told her that cinnamon sticks in tea help allergies and so I diligently boiled these up each night and morning just in case! It seemed to help! Other fellow hikers seemed to think I was drinking pepperoni tea...Mmmm pepperoni tea. Random! What were they thinking?!



The outhouses built at the campsite were awesome! &apos;Room with a view&apos; we called it as it was built up high, right on the beach with a massive window cut into the side to watch out whilst doing your business!



Well, if there was one thing we were this morning, it was definitely slow! Although we were out of bed by 8 something, we just could not seem to get moving! Luckily our ailmets and sore feet seemed to have miraculously fixed themselves overnight which we were all very grateful about as we got up and moving!



We had an awesome breakfast of porridge and freeze dried blueberries, packed up, filtered some more water from the creek, stone hopping up to the top of the stream to get the freshest water without getting out feet wet!



And ready! Ahh.... 1120! Oh well, we are on holiday! :-)



We headed off straight down the beach and were all super excited not to be plodding through the mud! Well... until we started sinking into the sand! But at least the novelty was there as we stepped our way down the stretch of beach and out onto the rocks exposed by the low tide. Oops! A little slippery with their random green or orange moss. As we learnt quickly... foot placement is everything!!



And then came the creek run offs! And crossings! We navigated the first few well, but they became too deep and too slippery to be jumping between rocks in our backpacks as we bit the bullet and waded well over ankle high. Boots, socks, gaiters and all totally saturated! Damn it! And they had only just semi dried out from yesterday!!



Nothing like starting off your hike with wet feet, we continued trudging over the slippery rocks, through the sand and crossing boulders.



The region is known as &apos;The Graveyard of the Pacific&apos; as over 50 ships have sunk here over the past 100 years. We saw the giant boiler of the &apos;Michigan&apos; sitting on the rocks that went down in 1893 and also a giant anchor washed up on the beach on another part of the trail.



We sat down to a delightful lunch of tuna wraps and headed inland due to an impassable headland ahead. Straight away we came across our biggest and steepest ladders to date! Wow! Levels of them! And coming down was a 78 year old man. Pretty impressive!!



Puffing we arrived at the top to find a tsunami safe zone. Wow, really?! The amount of time that it took us to get up there, good luck when the tsunami comes!!



And the mud returned! We tramped through countless continuous stretches of mud and muddy water, sometimes over 2ft deep sinking our poles in and deciding where to put our feet. Clearly not there! :-)



We also passed a few rusted out random bits of machinery from when they had cleared the trail way back when. They were massive! I have no idea how on earth they managed to get them in, but totally understand why they left them there when they had finished!!



There were also fallen trees everywhere, some breaking bridges and boardwalks and cut through so we would still pass. Others we had to climb over or balance along. One tree that had fallen alongside of us was about 8m in diameter. Crazy!!



Luckily the track then changed to straight boardwalks which was a nice change! ahh! They then started to be on crazy angles, upside down, stopping randomly like high dive boards into pools of mud below or just plain rotten, loose or missing planks. A constant challenge to keep you concentrating! :-)



A bit more mud, random boardwalks, and our first suspension bridge! Exciting! A dozen more regular bridges, a few cool waterfalls, another suspension bridge, a few ladders and we were back down walking on the beach again! Yay! It was a nice change from the mud, but walking through the soft sand was really starting to wear us down as we tried to walk in each others footsteps. So beautiful though!



We had a little otter run right in front of us and hang around for a while which was really cool and found lots of other cool sea creatures in all the little tidal pools.



We had to power along the beach to ensure we were off before the tide came in and we were definitely ready to hit the track to take us back inland again. As per the map, we had to head inland in order to avoid an impassable headland on the beach. The trail is not marked anywhere, so you have to watch out for buoys hanging from the trees so you know where to enter again... and don&apos;t get caught somewhere you don&apos;t want to be!



Just a few minutes in we hit our first cable car! The cable car was high above the Klanawa River which is about 40m wide. We were so excited as we arrived, pulled the cable car up, piled 2 people and their bags in, let go and flew as the gravity took us halfway!! So much fun!!!



From there we had to hand over hand pull ourselves and the cable car to the far side. Wow it was tough work as luckily the others at the side helped us pull! We got the cable car up onto the platform, steadied it as we grabbed our stuff, jumped out, and then sent it back for the next guys. So much fun!!



We were all on a high as we reshouldered our packs, climbed down the ladder and re-entered the muddy forest.



We only had a few more km to go as we came out to a vantage point at the top of a cliff and saw our campsite.... tiny small tents on the beach. Definitely still a walk away!



The mud and broken boardwalks continued but at least it was fairly easy going compared to the previous stretches! It was a struggle though, with wet feet, wet shoes, wet socks and constant pounding, it was definitely starting to take its toll on the feet!



We crossed another bridge and looked out to our right to see it just drop off. Tsusiat Falls! We had made it!



But the path continued for about another 200m and we then hit them.... a massive sequence of ladders! It was down as far as we could see as we began our descent. It did go on forever, but luckily they were short, platforms between them and not so steep so it was okay! We were then on the beach and our campsite. Finally!



We had a couple of hundred metres to walk back along the sinking sand on the beach, and it felt like forever!



We passed the amazing Tsusiat falls, a tall and wide platform cascading down onto the beach and set up camp in the piles of driftwood acting as a windbreak.



It had been another long day, another 8 hours of straight hiking, over 8 hours, 13 km covered and as we gratefully sank down and pulled off our muddy gaiters and shoes, my feet were so soft and white and wrinkled like prunes. And so painful!



I gingerly lifted each foot, but score... no blisters! Painful and swollen, but no blisters!!! I was super glad too as I was just hoping i had not jinxed myself as putting away my first aid kit as &apos;non essential &apos; weight (we already had a group one), i had said &apos;but i have never had blisters with these!!&apos; famous last words! :-)



We had another feast from our menu plan Ang had prepared - a dehydrated bag meal of lasagne... or pieces of lasagne sheets, meat sauce and cheese all mixed together more correctly!



It was an epic mission to get to the out houses and bear boxes after that! There was about another 200m stretch of sand to walk over, interspersed with pieces of driftwood to climb until you saw some buoys hanging from trees on the right. Climbing over about 5m of driftwood, piled about 3m high you eventually made it out the other side and up a small muddy walk to the bear box and outhouse. Wow! Definitely not attempting this in the dark!!





The outhouse was cool though, another window cut out for a view along the beach which made it almost worth the trek to get there! Almost! :-)



We had a little campfire on the beach and Ang and Keith told me that putting hot rocks in your shoes dries them out... and so I tried it! The next morning the rocks were all wet and the shoes slightly drier. Weird!



My hip bones were really sore from the weight of the pack and as I lifted my shirt to investigate, found massive lumps bigger than a 50c piece on each hip, swollen and hard. mmm not nice! Let&apos;s hope they go down by tomorrow!!



And yes! bed! We all kind of limped off and crashed totally. And this was supposed to be the easy part of the trail!!
 
Relax! Tsusiat Falls 0km, 25-25km, Day 4!

2011-07-25

We had decided to give ourselves a rest day here at the falls as it was so beautiful and we were already ahead of schedule due to hiking on the first day. And we were so glad as we slept in, relaxed, feasted on freeze dried fruit porridge, washed our clothes, swam in the beautiful water of the waterfall and rested our sore swollen feet and hip bones!



Another feast of 2 min noodles with beef flavour, french onion soup and cut up jerky made a delicious lunch before chilling away from the super hot sun in the afternoon.



The campsite was simply beautiful. Maybe the nicest campsite ever! The waterfall, the beach, stretches of sand, driftwood, cliffs, trees and the beautiful endless sky to top it off! So lovely!



We sat and watched the procession of hikers arrive down the beach, often sole travelers plodding along with everything on their back. It was quite cool!



We had massive discussions everyday what we would eat from our gourmet food selection for every meal, each person campaigning loudly for one particular meal, that they knew was in their pack to make it lighter! We couldn&apos;t stop laughing about it!



Dinner tonight was Salmon Chowder, with bag salmon, milk powder, potato powder, freeze dried corn and crackers! Actually delicious and tasted just like chowder!!! Who would have thought!! Although there was enough to feed an entire small nation!



And after lessons learnt from our last camping trip, it was all made and cooked in one zip lock bag we could put boiling water in and then wash out and throw away (well, put back in our packs! :-) ) and no dirty dishes to scrub! Score!!



There was only one bear locker here at the camp, weird, seeing as the size of the camp, but luckily we were early so we could get our bags in, we could make the mission there before dark and we were safe from bears for the night! Not that it mattered as we looked around the next morning and found some idiots had tied their food that didn&apos;t fit into the lockers high in the air... but right in the middle of the tent area. Tools!!



We had an awesome night sitting around the campfire, just a few dozen metres from the waterfall. Amazing!!



I mummified up my feet in preparation for the next day... dropped the knife I was using to cut the tape and punctured my mattress on the very last piece... doh!!! Then time for bed, lulled to sleep by the sound of the waterfall! So nice! I could definitely get used to this!
 
Roots, UP and Boardwalks! Tsusiat Falls-Cribs Creek 25-42km, Day 4

2011-07-26

Need to edit



After a restless night constantly waking up and listening for rain that was supposed to be due today, it was finally time as the alarm went off at 0630h..... and no rain!!! woohoo!!



We were up early to achieve an epic 18km today... kind of scary as previous days had taken us on average 36mins for a single kilometre through the forest!



Another epic trip half way down the beach and climb over the driftwood to get to the outhouse and bear bins and finally back to camp. phew!



A delicious freeze dried berry porridge breakfast, water filtering mission and we were on our way.... ahhh.... just over two hours to make it out of camp! Well, at least we were getting better! With a mission of forever to get to the bear box and about 20L of water to filter, it doesn&apos;t make it an easy chore though!



And so we sadly bid farewell to the beautiful falls that had been our home for the past two days as we began the trek along the beach to our next adventure.



It was loose sand and hard walking as I walked in others footsteps to attempt to conserve energy.



luckily the sand soon gave way to rocks and cool sea creatures living in the tidal pools and lots of awesome scenery!



As we neared Tsusiat Point we could see the &apos;hole in the wall&apos; that we were required to pass through...but the tide was coming in fast and with no inland access we had to hightail it down the beach to make it.



Water was coming in waves as we timed our runs and all managed to make it through without getting wet and no one injured! Within half an hour it would be impassable so we had just made it!



We were also given advice to unclip our backpack straps in case we fell or were pulled under we could escape and not drown... but impossible to run fast enough to beat the tide with it that way!! :-)



Unfortunately the next crossing around the rocks was not to be so lucky as ankle deep water came in and surrounded .... and wet feet again! Damn! :-)



There was a dangerous surge channel ahead so we headed inland and started the forest trail. Up, up and up!! And roots!!!!! So many tree roots we had to climb over as we continued through the muddy path.



We also came across our first floating log. Sitting in the mud puddle, it looks solid enough to stand on and identical to the hundreds of others we had already used previously, but submerged to undeterminable depths when you put your weight on it.



Luckily this one was just small, but we met a girl on the trail who had stood on one and fallen in to the point where she was submerged and couldn&apos;t feel a firm bottom. Nasty!!



We also had to cross a creek that was filled with massive piles of giant driftwood!! A log jam some of the other hikers called it, but super fun!!



After many more roots and up and more roots and more up we came across a steep walkway, so steep it had a rope to pull yourself up it! Navigating this we successfully came out to Nitinat Narrows where the open boat ferry service for the hikers was waiting! Perfect timing!



We had paid for this ferry ($16!!) run by the local Aboriginal people, at the check in centre when we started and so boarded for the couple of minutes it took to take us literally just across the other side of the river.



There on a jetty was set up a little open restaurant where the locals cooked up fresh crab or salmon with a baked potato for $20. It looked amazing, but unfortunately not quite in the budget!



They also sold soda cans for $2 and beers for $7, and little bags of chips, but we just sat down and enjoyed our gourmet lunch of tuna and cheese wraps with relish and ranch dressing which were awesome!



The guy there even came and gave Ang and I some lollies each which was so nice!



The next part of the trail involved possibly the easiest section to date. Boardwalks!!And all there!! It was an amazing treat walking through the forest on them and the kilometres flew by!



All too soon they returned to various stages of rotten, missing sections, angles, broken, falling apart and mud! We knew it was too good to be true!!



We climbed a few epic hills, passed the halfway point of the trail, crossed a few more bridges and climbed some ladders, but were definitely covering ground!



We had a few options for beach access, but had already climbed so high over the rough terrain that there was no way we were climbing ladders back down there again!! Lucky we didn&apos;t also cause the map said it wasn&apos;t a good idea and when we saw the cliffs to climb and the rope hanging off it to pull yourself up we were super glad we were still on the inland route!



We passed some beautiful views as we walked right on the cliff edge of the trail, small untouched coves, rugged expanses of beach, it was awesome!



Soon after a lot of downs, the trail popped out onto the beach and we enjoyed the last km&apos;s over the beach to the campsite - Cribs Creek.



We also came across garter snakes on our various toilet stops. Cool!



The last section was ridiculous - a giant wave coming up super close to us on the rocks as we all scurried away and then slip sliding across the giant expanse of slippery green moss, seaweed and random sea sludge. It was seriously nature&apos;s skating rink! unbelievable!



And we were first in! Setting up on prime real estate we pumped another billion litres of water from Cribs Creek next to the camp and settled in around the campfire to eat our feast of chicken, stuffing and cranberries! Delicious!!



We enjoyed chillaxing, drying shoes, watching the tide come in closer and closer over the rocks, the lovely pink of the sunset and our fire before bed! Easiest day so far!! Even at the longest with 18km and 8hours walk!!! :-)
 
Lighthouse,sealions,burgers!cablecar,whale!sand,rocks,river! Cribs Creek-Walbran Creek 42-53km Day5

2011-07-27

Needs editing!



We had a lazy wake up this morning, taking out time with our delicious freeze dried berry and banana porridge with flax seeds; peppermint and cinnamon stick tea and packing snacks for the days journey ahead. Snack packing... probably the most important part of the day! :-)



It was also the first time that we had eaten down enough food that my pack actually shut!! Exciting times!!



I really liked this little campsite at Cribs Creek, but it was time for new adventures as our first order of the day was rock hopping across Cribs Creek! It is amazing how quickly you adapt to the extra weight and are comfortable balancing and hopping over slippery rocks with an extra 35lb on your back!



Climbing over rocks and driftwood, it was then deep sinking into sandy sand for the next part as we then crossed rocks and watched was a crazy mist engulfed us.



As the beach disappeared into the headland, we started up the stairs, ladder and several more sets of super steep stairs that went on forever before we arrived at Carmanah Point Lighthouse.



The lovely lady lighthouse keeper there came out to meet us and told us about her life there, how supplies were delivered by boat once a month and then brought up to the point by a pulley system and hook from the rocks below; and how they had to get in and out by helicopter! She also warned us about a bear on the beach as the berries were not out yet!



She then brought out a massive telescope and set it up so we could watch the sea lions on the rocks just out to sea. So awesome!



The mist that was following us suddenly rolled in and wiped it out in a haze of white and we could not see a thing in front of us, so very good timing we had arrived when we had!



We headed out the back of the station onto the forest trail for a bit until we hit a series of ladders down... that were only half as long as the ones up. Random! And then we saw it!! The place we had been looking forward to all trip!! The plastic wrapped huts of &apos;Chez Monique&apos;, a burger bar and convenience store in the middle of nowhere on the trail!



We made our way in, dropped our packs, checked out the selection of lollies, fizzy drinks, chips and other items available before ordering our choice of burgers from $15-$17. The food took a while to come out as it is all made fresh by Monique and her two side kicks - one an Aussie guy who was WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms - http://www.wwoof.org/ ), who had started there a few seasons ago and has since come back every year, the other guy from Ontario, and Monique from Montreal!



Such a random place for them to end up, making burgers for hikers in plastic wrapped shelters on a deserted beach with all their supplies shipped in!



We all had cheeseburgers which came with tomato sauce, relish, onion, tomato, lettuce and a side cous cous or coleslaw salad! And they were delicious! There was a mass of other stuff on the menu though, fishburgers, omelettes, salad plates, and something for everyone!



We watched as a multitude of hungry hikers came in and out, we wolfed down our feast and hit the beach again!



Ahh maybe burgers are not the best food to go hiking on as they sat like dead weights in our stomachs, but i would do it again anyway! :-)



Sand, sand, rocks, slippery rocks, tide pools, sand, rocks! And so began our afternoon! And then we hit Carmanah Creek... it was too deep to wade through and so trudged inland to take the cable car across. woohoo! I love those things!



So much fun!! We totally loved them, pulling them over to our side, loading the packs and two of us in, sipping across half way and then pulling (or more correctly the boys at the other end pulled!) us out!



Just as we were exited out onto the beach there was a whale literally 150m out to sea! It blew up water, swam out of the waves and stuck its head out really high!!! We could not believe it!! It was amazing!!!



The rest of the day was along the beach, sand, rocks, through tidal pools, crushing thousands of poor little periwinkles to a shattering &apos;crunch&apos; under our boots as we walked and then through masses of seaweeds in varying colours of green, orange and brown. And walking through a MASSIVE flock of seagulls that all took off into the air as we approached, we kind of hesitated, covering our heads and waiting for one of us to be hit, but luckily escaping!!



The rocks and various seaweed coverings were deceptive! Trying to keep our feet dry and step in shallow water only sometimes did not go as planned as we expected to sink a few centimeters, but before we knew it were ankle deep in water!



Eventually we saw the camp ahead! Woohoo! Hmmm but had Walbran creek between us and it! We took off our shoes, gaiters and zipped off our pants as we stepped into our sandals and navigated the icy cold creek in front of us. Brr! It was quite the current, but luckily not too wide and only just above knee height!



And camp! We set up, pumped water and sat down to a pre-prepared dehydrated &apos;Mountain House&apos; hikers meal of Macaroni Cheese. But unfortunately it was an epic fail ! Tasteless and unsatisfying! Luckily Keith had some salt and seasoning as we cranked it on, but still reached in to raid our snacks! Give us Ang prepared food anyday! :-)



Link also had some marshmallows that he had been carrying that we toasted over the campfire. Ahhh so nice!



It was amazing to watch the tide come in to totally remove all evidence of the creek we had just walked over earlier as it cut us off, joining the lake next to the campsite! I didn&apos;t really realise until I was washing the dishes in the Lake watching the little fish in the water and thinking to myself, hmm this Lake seems to be getting closer to me... yup! Tide had joined up with it!



As with most days we were lucky enough to watch eagles soaring above us and the sunset (albeit cloudy) over the beautiful ocean and west coast trees. ahhh! :-)



It was another epic journey climbing over mountains of driftwood to get to the outhouses and bear boxes again! Seriously crazy! Fun though! Well... not so much in the dark, but hey!



It was an early night to prepare for our epic day tomorrow! Apparently one of the toughest....!



We had been SO lucky so far with the weather too. Today was beating hot, but definitely wins over rain anyday!



So another amazing day on the trail! 11km completed in 5 1/2 hours.... And massive stops for sea lion watching at the light house and burgers! I think we are getting the hang of this! :-)
 
Awesome!!Mud,roots,trees,ladders!!&amp;the day that never ended! Walbran Ck-Campers Cove 53-62.5km Day6

2011-07-28

Needs editing!!



We woke up early this morning and were greeted by a misty and wet fog engulfing us! Oh oh... I hope the weather holds out!!



Another mission over the driftwood to the outhouses and bear boxes, a relaxed delicious porridge brekky and about 2 1/2 hours later we were on our way!



luckily the mist didn&apos;t give way to rain as we entered into the forest and trees above and began the stretch of mud, roots, fallen trees, mud, roots, fallen trees!



We walked along the length of numerous fallen trees acting as bridges as we cautiously attempted to keep our balance and stay in one piece on them! It was a mix of a variety of slopes and depths, often with stairs cut out of them and constantly various stages of slipperiness just to keep us on our toes!



We also had our fair share again of broken, sideways and slippery boardwalks that we had a few close calls sliding on, but all&apos;s well that ends well! :-)



Some of the trees were crazy - fallen, with enough impact and weight to break the boardwalks and then we had to climb up and use that as the new boardwalk! Or use it to slowly, slipperily and perilously carefully navigate as a bridge several metres above a creek! Crazy!! Just don&apos;t look down! But a great adrenalin rush when you get over it in one piece!!



others we had to try and duck under (nearly impossible with the giant backpacks and if we wanted to avoid face planting in mud!), clamber over or get around somehow!



It was the world&apos;s supply of mud here too - enough to coat the entire human population in day spa&apos;s twice over!! A few floating logs, slippery rocks, stretching unceremoniously between various &apos;safe&apos; steps... all in a days fun! It was worse trying to step around, over, any which way through the roots and muddy water piled around them!



Sooooooooo many roots! We spent all day stumbling over these things! If I ever see these things again it will be too soon!



And then.... the ladders!!! They began in earnest!!! Starting off small, and then we hit Logans Creek....!!



Several levels of ladders down, further than we could see! And as you step off the last ladder you are brought directly down onto the most awesome massive suspension bridge over Logan River!! It is about 100m across and about 50m above the water and so narrow that a protruding thermarest would catch and hook you... the last thing you wanted on this as it swayed so much you had to kind of catch your breath, hold on and reevaluate your position...but also so cool!!!



And then the other side.....! Possibly Scary.... but also possibly the coolest thing ever!! There was a series of about 7 or 8 levels of ladders (we lost count!!!) and there was one in the middle that was so tough we literally had to pull ourselves and our stupidly heavy backpacks up each rung, our breath getting heavier and heavier with each upward movement. Not fun!!!!



Another super SUPER wobbly. Not sure what was going on with that, but definitely a little scary as you just hoped like hell you wouldn&apos;t fall, your hands or feet wouldn&apos;t slip or give way, your head pinned by your backpack and not knowing how far you had to go!!!



And just to top it off there was another...with 200 rungs!!! yup!!! That is the equivalent of 60 storeys!!!!! And you are already breathing heavily and a little shaky by this time! Definitely one of the coolest experiences ever as we thankfully arrived at the top, puffing, but successfully!!! Looking down it was crazy to see what we had just come up!!! No pictures can really show the depth of what we had accomplished!!



I heard around the campfire that night that a girl had fallen here earlier in the week after slipping off the top of a ladder; broken her leg and it took about four hours for them to be able to get the chopper in to be able to winch her out due to the terrain! Pretty scary!



Next up was some more of the trail and just a couple of levels of ladders down to Cullite Creek.. so a walk in the park! :-) And then even better it brought us out to a cable car across the creek. Awesome! Love those things!!



We stopped down on the banks of the creek for a delicious &apos;everything&apos; bagel with cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, bacon and chive lunch courtesy of Ang&apos;s Gourmet Catering and my backpack! :-)



And then we looked up. Oh oh! Ladders seriously as far as we could see up the hill behind us and disappearing into the forest.



We began the hike towards them and began our ascent. Again it was levels upon levels, one even on such a crazy angle that you were basically crawling...just on a ladder high above ground with a backpack.... you know... as you do! Crazy!! :-)



More mud, tree roots and boardwalks and it was Sandstone Creek and more ladders, although nothing fazed us now after the last few absolutely ginormous sets we had just climbed!!



It was definitely the most interesting and exciting day we had had so far, but unfortunately it did begin to drag on as the mud and roots continued and continued and continued!



I had one close call as I slipped down a tree root and somehow magically reappeared on a boardwalk several feet away grabbing Keith&apos;s outstretched hand and not the mud between us! I have no idea at all how that managed to happen, but definitely score!!!!!



I can&apos;t say much more! It got more and more and more tiring, but soon we saw the ladders down to camp! Woohoo! Just a few levels this time and we had done about 9.5/10km in about 7,5 hours. Long day in the forest! Every step you take and look up it is just more of the same!!



We were at Campers Cove for the night and set up, trying to waste as much fuel as possible in order to reduce our weight a we cooked a delicious turkey ramen noodle bowl for dinner and then raiding our ever diminishing snacks as we just could not stop eating!! Snacks were clearly the mot important part of our days! :-)



A bit more water filtering, a sit around a campfire with some other hikers, hearing about another 9 evacuations this week and drying shoes! So exciting!!! The first time in a week they will have been practically dry! The lovely hikers camped next to us even rotated them and dried them out on all sides whilst I was off collecting water and having dinner too! So nice!



We sat around chatting before it was bed time, ready for our next few big days!!
 
Most Amazing day! Stunning beach walks! Campers Cove-Thrashers Cover 62.5-70km Day7

2011-07-29

Needs editing!



Another foggy, misty, heavy morning greeted us, dropping little droplets of water over everything as we got ready to head out.



A delicious brekky, burning lots and lots of fuel and to the first stop - the cable car over Campers Creek!



We thought the ladders would begin right away but we had some more mud and roots to trip over first!



Several levels later we were becoming pro&apos;s as we scaled the ladders and completed the first few kilometres of today&apos;s leg inland.



It was much nicer and easier than yesterday!! Maybe we weren&apos;t so tired, or maybe we knew that there was an end in sight!!



It was definitely becoming easier and easier to navigate through the mud puddles and over the roots before we stopped at a lookout where the cliff just dropped away below us and then hit beach access point A. There we waited for the tide to go out so we could complete the remainder of the leg on the beach. And quite glad we did too as we watched various other hikers stumbling through the inland route as we sat there waiting!



We had made good time through the forest so had about 2 hours to kill as we played cards, ate curried chicken and cashew wraps for lunch and chatted with other hikers as they too arrived to wait for the tide. And I also managed to sit on one of the giant trail slugs. Nice... Not! :-)



At about 2 we headed down to the beach and navigated out way down the slippery rock edge to the amazing rock shelf several metres lower where we would be walking for the rest of the day.



The route was amazing!! SO beautiful!! A little slippery...! but amazing! We passed tidal pools, jumped small channels, climbed over coral looking rock formations (honeycomb rock it is called as I found out later), found tiny untouched coves and large streams we had to navigate around with ropes tied in the trees above them to assist us! So cool!



Soon though we hit Owen Point and had to wait for the tide to go out fully to make it passable. We joined the other hikers sitting on the rocks as we waited, staring at a rock just 30 or so metres to our front covered in Sea Lions, Seals and Seagulls!! A few seals were even playing in the water too, it was just absolutely amazing!!!



The cave we had to cross through was full of water though as we settled in for a couple of hours to wait until the tide went out.



Watching the water recede so slowly seemed to take forever! Eventually Hoku jumped down onto the slippery rock shelf below and determined the route possible as everyone grabbed their backpacks... a little cautiously!



It was ridiculously slippery as Hoku went first and had to pretty much rock climb and hold on for dear life as his feet slipped beneath him.



We formed a line and passed our packs down to him and did the slippery walk clean skinned. And it was amazing! The cave was so awesome to walk through as we looked around us in awe and headed onto the beach on the far side.



It was so funny though as Hoku stood and kind of hung from the rocks, giving everyone his free hand as they passed to steady themselves. Except for two people who decided that they didnt need to take it.... yup, too funny!! One totally slipped and went into the water and one slid so out of control he accidently punched Hoku in the stomach!! They learnt their lesson though, no one else tried to do it alone!! :-)



It started to get a little rocky... and then boulders! Literally! Giant Boulders anywhere between less than a metre to almost as big as a housse we had to climb in, over or around!!



At times driftwood had settled amongst it as we had to go over it, through it, under it or up it balanced precariously. At one stage I thought under was the best option as I attempted to squeeze myself and my backpack under, ending up flat on my stomach, pinned by above and literally squirming to be able to move inch by inch to get through!! Tough!!!!! Lesson learnt - next time over!!! :-)



And tough climbing over and balancing on these boulders with a 30 something lb pack on your back too!! Sooooo tough!!!



But Soooooo cool and Soooo amazing at the same time!!!!! I totally loved it!!!! My muscles were all jellyish by the end though!! shattered!!!





It was about 2km of boulders and the tide was starting to come in as we made our dash to beat it. We were already starting to get sprayed by the incoming tide hitting rocks and places we had to jump through were becoming deeper and deeper with pools of water.



But finally ahead we saw the welcome site of Thrasher Cove - our campsite for this evening. Thankfully! We were shattered and in desperate need of food! :-)



There wasn&apos;t much space due to the amount of people already set up there, but we squeezed our tents in literally just above the high tide mark! Literally! Like a metre away... that was all the space we had!



One final time filtering water! One last time getting water filtering muscles! And one final time being harassed by mosquitoes as we tried to complete this! Woohoo!



One final dehydrated meal of Mountain House Beef Stew - our least favourite and the one we had left until the very end! A mass of tiny peas and pea sized squares of beef and potato that were a super weird chewy consistency and all tasted the same! It was warm and satisfying though so cant really complain too much! :-)



One final dish wash with sand and fish in the creek, one final toothbrush on the tide line with other random hikers, and one final attempt to shove all the food and toiletries into the already full bear boxes and not look at the massive ladders stretching high into the sky behind the outhouses.



We sat around the campfire with John, Randy and Laura, some other hikers we had been crossing for the past week and also heard stories of how the inland route took its toll on people with a hiker from another group receiving a gash to the forehead from a fall on the slippery roots.



A pretty sunset and cool lit up trawler out to sea as we looked at Port Renfew, our finishing point tomorrow across the water.



Marshmallows toasted, shoes, gaitors and clothes dried out (well...mostly!) and time to attempt to reinforce the high tide mark with logs to stop our tent - only a metre away!!!- getting wet.



It was unnerving going to bed listening to the water lap literally right next to us and hope it stopped before it hit our tent and us!!



Probably the toughest day complete!!! 7km in 10 hours! Super fun!! :-)
 
Pegged as the toughest day! Trail Complete! Thrashers Cove-Port Renfew 70-75km Day8

2011-07-30

Needs editing!!!



It was definitely a nice start to the day to wake up and find that the high tide had just come to the other side of the logs about a metre away from our tent and no further! Woohoo! It had totally wiped out the fire where we had all sat last night though! Too funny!



This was supposed to be our hardest day and one that we had all been looking to with a slight trepidation. 5km in 6 hours according to the guide book. That is about the equivalent of 800m covered every hour. Crazy!! We were definitely a little scared!



And we were off. And 1km of ladders to start... straight up! Maybe because we were expecting the day to be tough we found it no harder or different to the rest of the trail that we had already covered.



It was a little bit of mud, but mainly just roots to clambour over and get stuck in our crappy useless MEC gaitors; and lots of slippery rock faces to pass over, up, through and down!





We finished the final sets of the 37 sets of ladders and over the final of the 108 bridges en route.



There was some crazy steep slopes up and down and then ladders up and down and mor roots!



The forest was so amazing and quiet as we walked, no other sounds but our breathing. So nice! We did have a super cool misty fog to walk through in the forest which was awesome to see the tall trees rising out of it and a little squirrel playing on the forest floor.



We passed a derelict donkey engine... which meant.... woohooo!!! km72!!! And just 3 to go!!! We were making really good time.. compared to what the guidebook had recommended!!



Then a couple of kilometres lasted FOREVER and ever... and then! km75!! We had made it!!!



Too funny though that wasn&apos;t the last of the track as we had to then navigate across a slippery rock water run off and other random obstacles to make it down to the beach. We just kept laughing and saying &apos;imagine getting evacuated out at km75&apos;!!!!



We met up with the rest of the group waiting on the beach and the others arrived! Success! Trail complete!!



Raising the orange buoy to signal to the boat operator we were ready to be picked up, we watched him journey down the river to collect us (and check our permits to make sure we had paid the $16!!).



Checking out at the registration centre we found it was actually 53 evacuations to date, not the 58 we had been told on the trail! Chinese Whispers!! :-)



We had our final lunch with cream cheese, peanut butter, jam, honey and all leftover condiments with bagels and wasted off the useless MEC gaitors that took us 20mins to do up each morning; and our boots for the final time!!



We had made good time finishing in just 3 1/2 hours and so had a few hours to wait until the bus came at 4.15.



We napped, played cards, watched the thousands of sea gulls fly and unfortunately poo on both Keith and Hoku, and walked to the nearby campsite and had hot dogs - our first non dehydrated food in days!!



The West Coast Trail Express Bus arrived, we packed our backpacks in the back, and watched in amazement and then dismay as the bus driver got seriously confused and unpacked and then repacked and then unpacked them all at the next few drop offs, having us drive around for almost an hour with several people standing before we were on our way!!



We eventually all had seats and were on our way!! About 2 hours later we arrived back into Victoria and bid farewell to the other hikers we had crossed continuously on the trail for the past week,



Using out extreme navigation skills we managed to find our way back to Shemmicks hours and had our first shower, running water and clean clothes in over a week!



It was already half past eight by this point as we quickly made our way to the hotel the other boys were staying at and walked the couple of blocks into town.



Victoria is So beautiful!! We walked past he Parliament/Legislature building (some conjecture about what to call it!!) all lit up looking like something from a fairy tale, and onto the marina full of sailboats and a night market, the Empress Hotel all lit up opposite!!! Ahhhh so pretty!!



The old fashioned streetlights were beautiful, as with the planter boxes of coloured flowers hanging from them.



We headed up the main street and stopped into the Bard and Banker Scottish Pub for dinner. We were all usually well and truly in bed by this time, but we were so starving and so ready for some real food that we didn&apos;t have to add water to in order to eat it!!!



We sadly said our farewells to the Seattle bound trio and stumbled back to a well deserved bed!
 
The Summary! West Coast Trail, Vancouver Island, B.C. Canada

2011-07-30

I have uploaded some short movies too if you want to see what it was like!! :-)



The trail was beautiful!! And the hike amazing!!! To be able to have the opportunity to walk across deserted beaches, camp right on the beach, drink delicious fresh amazing water right from the creeks, wander through untouched forest, climb over giant boulders, wait for tides to hike through caves, take cable cars, up through creeks, up levels and levels of ladders, see wildlife up close and the amazing versatility of nature, it had been brilliant!! And all complete with backpacks carrying everything that you needed to survive!!! Pretty amazing!!!



In summary there was:

108 Bridges

-including 4 suspension bridges,

37 SETS of ladders

-anywhere from 1-8 in a set!!

-ranging in size from 1m-60m

-the longest and most rungs...207!!! (The south side of Cullite Creek), not including platforms,

-5 cable cars,

-75km,

-Enough mud, slippery surfaces and roots to cover the earth twice, and

AMAZING!!! :-)



For those thinking of doing it I have made a summary of the most important things!!

1. Waterproof boots!!!! CRUCIAL!!!!! Clearly I know this first hand!!! :-)

2. Gaiters NOT from MEC!!!! Clearly I also know this first hand!! :-)

3. Hiking Poles (Saved your knees, stopped you slipping and tested unsafe routes SO many times!!)

4. SNACKS!!!! (We couldn&apos;t stop eating!!!!)

5. Ang&apos;s Gourmet Catering for Meals! (Thanks Ang! You will notice I have talked a lot about food in these blogs... more and more as they went on I noticed which cracked me up! Clearly it was quite important to us!!! :-) )

6. Advil (Makes those aches instantaneously disappear overnight! poof! Good as new the next morning!!)

7. Sleeping with your feet uphill (Poof! Swelling gone by the morning!! :-) )

8. Toilet Paper. Hand Sanitizer. Enough said!

9. A cushion! (doubles as a (low) pillow and gosh it saves your arse! You are definitely sick of sitting on the ground by day 1 without it!!)

10. Jerky. Oh yes, we ate our body weight in this!

11. A good water filter. As much as we loved the instant muscles we got from filtering, a good on makes this so much easier!)

12. Odourless deodorant. So the bears won&apos;t attack you. Not sure if it worked or not, but there were no bears, so I guess the answer was yes! :-)

13. Jetboil. This may be the greatest invention ever! Super convenient, super light and 2 cups of boiling water in just 2 mins! Genius!

14. Good weather. Well, good luck working this one out, but I cannot imagine how different and how miserable our trip would have been if we had been cold and wet the whole time and even slipperier and MORE mud!!

15. Indiana Jones Theme Song. Needed for whistling as you navigate your crazy adventure! Definitely the theme song for our trip!

16. And most importantly... Foot placement is Everything!!! Don&apos;t forget it!!! :-)



Oh...and pack light!!!!!!! :-)
 
Beautiful! Victoria, Vancouver Island, B.C. Canada WCT Day9

2011-07-31

Needs editing!!



After a leisurely sleep-in in our luxurious mattresses, we ambled downtown admiring once again the gorgeous city and in and out of the cute little stores on Government Street, including an amazing chocolate shop and even better ice cream and lolly shop &apos;Oh Gelato&apos; that had a massive choice of gelato (66 flavours I believe!) all decorated beautifully and all kinds of sweet treats like frozen chocolate covered cheesecake slices on sticks!



We continued on to the Blue Fox Cafe on Fort St and joined the short queue to be seated inside for breakfast. Wow is this place popular! In the approximately ten minutes we stood waiting, the queue quadrupled as it stretched out and along the street!



It was a super cool little cafe though with the most awesome warped artwork on the walls by a local artist Martin Machacek - http://www.martycultural.com/ - that we admired throughout breakfast, especially this cool painting of a lighthouse and melted frame! Amazing! And then the most delicious sounding menu for a really good price. We wanted it all!!



The service was also great and when the food came it not only looked amazing, but was sooooo delicious we could not have been happier!!! This place certainly gets my vote to return to!! And soooooooo happy as well to have fresh fruit and yoghurt!!!!! Craving real food!!



We wandered back through town, down to the water to watch the float planes, through the markets and to watch the buskers entertaining along the water front.



And then it was a dash back, grab the backpacks and back to just arrive at the bus stop as the bus pulled in! Perfect! Our lucky day!



The bus ride over, we boarded the ferry and enjoyed another stunning cruise back through the super pretty Gulf Islands and stunning houses built with the most amazing views and water access.



And back onto home soil! John again kindly picked us up as he dropped me off and I waved goodbye. Amazing adventure complete!!!
 
And I return!! And off hiking! Fireworks, Night Markets, Outdoor Events&amp;eating;Moose! Van, Canada

2011-08-01 to 2011-08-02

After spending the last week hiking, what did I decide to do on my first day off? Yup, hiking!



I met some other couchsurfers at the bus stop downtown and we jammed onto the bus to head out to West Vancouver. It was so packed we had to ring the others stuck at the front of the bus to pass a message on!



The traffic around Stanley Park was crazy as we were stuck for an hour trying to get over the bridge to the NorthShore, but finally moving to get off at our destination - Lighthouse Park, West Van - http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/lighthouse-park/ .



It was a little disappointing, with people everywhere and the &apos;trails&apos; more like roads, and just a few hundred metres between the various parts of the park, but I guess I had been spoilt with what I had been doing the past week!



We had a nice view of the lighthouse and then an amazing view over the downtown core with the snow covered Mt Baker in Washington State, USA right behind it. Awesome!



A few of the others headed down the rocks into the chilly water... Hmm no thanks! Before the epic busride home.







Coa BBQ



Fireworks

People in inflatable boats

Smiley faces



Canada place yoga



Night Market

Deep fried cheesecake

Bouquets of small stuffed animals



Lacrosse tournament



Sleep



Now that summer is here there are so many awesome outdoor events and I joined a few friends on the waters edge in Coal Harbour to watch the screening of the movie &apos;Grease&apos; at the giant outdoor screen in the park. And free! Ah I love this city! It was such a beautiful location right on the edge of the water, the mountains in the background and

the lights of the city behind us. And everyone was getting into it singing along so so much fun!



My friend Dana&apos;s parents came to visit fron NZ and I joined them on a cycling tour of Stanley Park and the city, it was such an awesome sunshiney summers day.



We then headed out to Dana&apos;s friend Renee&apos;s house in Cloverdale for a BBQ with her, her husband Lorne and 2 year old son Brayden. It was awesome as we feasted on Moose steaks and Caribou that Lorne had shot himself. They were totally different - the Caribou was a much denser meat, kind of more like the consistency of liver, but a nicer flavour

and no awful aftertaste, and the moose was much more steamy, and a little fattier than I expected which surprised me, with the fat running through it, but quite tasty!



We had a massive feast with stuffed potatoes (like you used to make mum!) and all sorts of other deliciousness.



They even cooked blueberry pancakes for us in the morning!!! It was so nice! We even got a lift to and from the station, it was so nice. Unfortunately it is about an hour and a half transit or more to get there, but so nice!
 
A random new job - Working on the construction at BC Place - Vancouver, Canada

2011-08-03 to 2011-08-13

After applying for some logistics jobs, I received a call from a temp agency who had seen my resume asking me to sign on with them. Disillusioned with the temp agency I was using, I signed up not expecting anything, but told them when I would be back and to send me an email if they had any work.



I didn&apos;t expect to hear anything, but logged on after I had finished the trail to find an email telling me I was starting work at 0650h that Tuesday morning after the long weekend! That was quite some faith they put in me to be there!



I was to be working at BC place, the stadium two blocks from my house that was undergoing a renovation and a new roof being placed on it. I was to be on the Admin team of the construction company doing this.



The email told me to report to the East Airlock Gate and look for the &apos;PCL&apos; signs. Hmmm! None the wiser where i was going, i headed in that general direction, but did not have to worry as I joined a continuous row of hard hatted, safety vest clad workmen filing in. Hundreds, it appeared! Actually over a thousand I found out later!



It was a secure site that you had to swipe to get in and asking people for my contact, I randomly stood on the side of the road with several dozen others waiting for some directions. I ended up standing right next to a guy, Harry, who was also starting that day as an admin person as we stood waiting for further instructions.



Just before 7, a guy came out and started yelling for all those waiting for a safety orientation to move forward. He called out companies and as he called ours we stepped forward and were given hard hats, safety glasses, high vis vests and steel toed gumboots to put on before we could enter through the gate.



There were thirty of us undergoing the orientation as we got the safety and hazards brief, heard how to get around, what to do in an emergency and then headed inside to the briefing room to learn about the construction of the roof, upgrades of facilities and a lot of irrelevant information that we would never use - such as filling out safety and hazard reports - as we would be working in some form of &apos;office&apos;!



We were photographed for our ID to gain access and then taken to our &apos;office&apos;, which really was an office, the banquet room had been pulled apart and fitted with partitions and computers, desks, photocopiers, phones etc!



We could sit in regular clothes at our desks, but as soon as we needed to go to anywhere else in the stadium, including the toilets (!!), which were outside the protected area, or the other office, we had to don all our safety gear to walk outside! Hilarious! It made going to the bathroom quite the epic though!!



Definately one of my most unusual first days at work!



I was working as a part of the admin team and was in charge of document control so got to see a lot of interesting things I had not come across before! Learning the systems was not so much fun though!



Harry and I were taken on a tour of the construction site which was amazing! There was so much going on as well as the new roof with an upgrade of a lot of the inside so there was lots to see! We went out onto the field of play where there were all kinds of equipment and cranes working on the roof, as well as the surface and the seats. We went around the levels and then up onto the catwalk that runs along the inside of the top of the stadium! Awesome!! A birds eye view of the construction, and people working on all kinds of different areas!



There was also a seismic upgrade, which I had never seen anything like it before as we saw the installation of the seismic dampers which would take the impact of an earthquake and keep the building together long enough to get everyone out.



A large section of my time was also spent deciphering writing of the engineers and project managers so i could input the information into the quality control system. And I thought doctors were bad!!!



Even worse there were so many new words I had never heard of so words I thought were made up were actually real words so I had to then google them to find the correct spelling! I became an expert at deciphering efflorescence, nosing, and learnt all kinds of new construction terms!



Every day there was also a fun new noise to contend with! There was hammering, drilling, often scissor lifts inside the office working on the ceiling above us, beeping as they reversed right next to our desks, and then the installation of the new doors right next to my desk... THAT was a fun few weeks! Luckily I managed to get ear plugs after day one, but wow!!



And the amazing pidgeon noises.... wow. There was a massive problem with pigeons and consequently with them pooping everywhere and so to try and remove these there was a speaker playing hawk noises to scare them off. Great! Except it was right next to the door I worked at and all day everyday all I could constantly hear was this repeating tape!!! Argh! Enough to drive you crazy!! You couldn&apos;t not hear it, even with all the other random construction and drilling noises! Although I had to laugh when people came in commenting on the amount of birds that were out there and how loud they were!! :-)



And dust everywhere! Ugh! But I guess that comes with working on a construction site!! :-)



I thoroughly enjoyed it though, they had a welcome lunch for us when we arrived and everyone made us feel welcome and part of the team, it was great! We also were taken out for drinks and bar snacks every pay week Friday! So nice!



I also loved the fact that I could leave home 10 minutes before work, and still arrive on time! And even more so that I could wear jeans, hiking boots and hoodies!!! And just regular t shirts!!! SO good!!!

Volunteering at the Fringe - Vancouver International Fringe Festival

2011-09-12 to 2011-09-18

My friends Dana and Rahul had decided to volunteer at the Fringe Festival and I thought why not?! A few days later I received my acception and invitation to attend a free BBQ dinner and training night on Granville Island. Sweet! We also got a free t shirt to wear, passes for friends and a personal pass which would get us into any show with tickets left for free! For the entire festival! Awesome!!



The Vancouver International Fringe Festival is BC&apos;s largest theatre Festival and North America&apos;s most International Fringe Fest! In its 27 year, with over 600 performances by more than 80 groups in 11 days (8-18 Sep) and 30000 expected atendees, it was going to be awesome!! ( www.vancouverfringe.com   )



My first shift I checked in at the volunteer centre on Granville Island  that had been set up specifically for us to hang out in! There was a great buzz in the air and a real feel good atmosphere as i also ran into another friend Ryan there, also volunteering! So good!



My First Venue was The Waterfront Theatre at Granville Island, less than a hundred metres away, where I met some fun other volunteers and chatted to lots of people on the street. It was an awesome atmosphere with all the volunteers out in their blue shirts and so many locals out enjoying themselves. Everyone was super friendly and happy, talking and laughing with random strangers and artists came around serenading people or doing little skits to entice people to come to their shows.



As an Usher I made sure the information show board was up to date, assisted the ticket sellers and chatted to people as they arrived. I then collected tickets and showed people into the venue.... For the best part! Definitely scored the best job around as I was required to sit through all the shows in case there were any problems! Oh it&apos;s a tough life! :-)



My first show was &apos;Fortunate Son&apos;  (www.rollingstocktheatre.com). Based on a true story and set after the state funeral of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, it is about how his son Justin Trudeau inspired the nation with his speech and his decision whether or not to go into politics. Although it was definitely well written and acted, I think I missed a lot of the jokes knowing nothing previous Canadian politics!



Next I headed just a few minutes down the street with some other volunteers to the &apos;Fringe for all&apos; at Performance Works. Here 89 artists each had two minutes to entice you to head to their show! Awesome! Like a showcase of the best two minutes of every show at the fringe! Non stop laughs!!



My next shifts were at the Havana (www.havanarestaurant.ca ), a restaurant with a theatre in the back on Commercial Drive in East Van.



There was more crowd control of the queue required here as it was a main thoroughfare, but still super fun and easy as we all headed in to watch the first show of the night - &apos;Things that Never Happen&apos; by Travis Bernhardt (www.travisthemagician.blogspot.com ). It was awesome! A magic show that had us constantly laughing or gasping, a few of my personal favourites when he made us look into a swirling circle for ages and then look at his head. I won&apos;t spoil it, but hilarious!!!! Another one an audience member had to pick a number off a board Travis was holding and whatever action written on the back had to be done. Frowning, Travis gave the volunteer on stage the required hug as the card dictated, and as he did, the board was turned to us to see the remainder of the actions - all one single word... And totally the opposite of hug that&apos;s for sure!



I came out so energised and impressed I was a little disheartened to see the performer chatting with a guy who had played a part in the show when he was picked out of the audience for Travis to guess his ideal holiday destination. I eavesdropped as I heard them arranging to catch up, and turned out they were colleagues :-(. Ah disappointment that that trick had been staged!! :-(



The next show was Jim Sands : &apos;Charlie: A Hockey Story&apos; (www.jim-sands.ca ) a fantastic story that had us glued to the edges of our seats with Jim&apos;s storytelling as we heard all about his uncle, Charlie Sands&apos; time in the NHL 1933-43 and the &apos;longest game&apos; that went for 116 minutes in overtime!!! It was just a few minutes short of 3 back to back games. And games go for hours!!  I loved it! There was a singalong and the most amazing storytelling! And we found out what the &apos;puck&apos; is named after. Shakespeare! A Mid Summer Nights Dream! Hockey and Shakespeare = worlds apart, but It makes perfect sense when you hear it, I promise! It&apos;s all about the puck!



On the way home I actually thought I was going to be attacked by two drunk 50 year old men tonight when they came screaming abuse at me for riding my bike on the super wide foothpath... At literally snails pace... less than half a block from where it had been locked up on the provided bike racks on the foothpath... And the road had the traffic heading in the opposite direction to what I was going. Wow. Commercial Drive... I don&apos;t think I will be back after dark again!



Next shift I was back at Havana and saw Archy and Mehitabel by Jeff Culbert (www.jeffculbert.ca ). Jeff plays both Archy, the cockroach and Mehitabel, the alley cat who are both old reincarnated human souls. My favourite part was him acting out crickets &apos;cheerup! &apos;cheerup! Cheerup! Apparently it is what they are constantly saying with that noise they make! Too funny!



Second up was Sam Mullins - Tinfoil Dinosaur - about Sam&apos;s first years out of acting school, how he suffered from anxiety and how he was asked to make a tinfoil dinosaur whilst working as a waiter one night. This was sold out, but maybe I had to high an expectation because of that, as although it was entertaining, I don&apos;t think it did what his write up about it said it would, and  I much preferred Charlie!



Charlie, Which I got to watch a second time through that night; quite good that if I had to pick one to watch again it would be that!



And finally, it drew to a close! A shift at the Firehall Arts Centre, an old converted firestation in East Van was a nice change to see some new and different acts.



And it was packed!! Very, very popular as I was kept busy ripping tickets, answering questions and handing out programs.



Since You Left Us (www.sinceyouleftusonstage.wordpress.com) was the first show up. A great comedy about a recovering alcoholic who decides to return home and take her 17 year old son for the first time in 15 years. A totally dysfunctional family, her sister&apos;s best friend is a jack Russell which no one can understand and just before the family implodes, several deaths make them see what&apos;s important. It was really well written and acted and the 90 minutes flew by!



Heading out, the lobby was already starting to fill for the totally sold out - Smile (awkwardstageproductions.com). A fun, upbeat musical set behind the scenes at a teenage American beauty pagent. There were both a junior and senior cast performing, and today was the junior cast. They were all fantastic, with just two performers out of their depth! It was super fun as the &apos;adults&apos; were played by puppets and we saw all kinds of shenanigans occuring!



And it was over! Although it was so busy trying to work full time and volunteer, it was an amazing opportunity to see some world class performances that I would never have seen otherwise! Although it would have been awesome to be in the thick of the action on Granville Island some more, it was awesome to be a part of!



They are also putting on a volunteer party for us all on Tuesday with free food! Score! :-)



The volunteer party was at the Agro Cafe on Granville Island (http://www.agrocafe.org/locations/granville-island.php ) where the Fringe Bar had been for the festival.



A few performers had come along to do some shows for us and the first was the Progressive Polygamists (http://www.progressive-polygamists.ca/ ), whose tag line is &apos;What would it be like if your best friend was your sister-in-law, AND your husband’s wife?&apos;. And it was hilarious! The two performers, Emmelia Gordon and Pippa Mackie are part of a cult... ahhh commune.... ahhh community!! And are in the position of their tag line as the sing and act it out and try and convince us of its worth. Brilliant!



Next was Martin Dockery ( http://web.me.com/martindockery/Martins_Site/Welcome.html ) who had us in stitches as he told the story of the night before his first show he had flown across the USA for and the totally random story of how he ended up with gastro from a hermit crab and its consequences!!! Again...Brilliant! He speaks so much with his hands I was mesmerised... I thought for sure he must be doing sign language at first, then realised he is just really expressive! :-)



We had music and free food and drinks and then a lucky door prize where I won 2 free tickets to the arthouse cinema, Pacific Cinematheque (http://www.cinematheque.bc.ca/ ) which was nice! I had met up with Fringe Friend Tyler who I had worked with, and also other friends Rahul, Ryan and Christie who had all also volunteered there for an awesome catch up before we got talking to Martin Dockery, the performer who we had watched earlier and his girlfriend Vanessa (who was also a performer). We couldn&apos;t stop laughing as we all chatted the night away before unfortunately it was time to hit the sack ready for work the next morning! An interesting thing I also found out was that locals offer to billet the fringe performers as well! Pretty cool! So they get to stay in a real house and get to see the local culture as well!
 
Where did time go?!

Black Tusk - The most beautiful hike ever! B.C. Canada

2011-09-24 to 2011-09-25

After several months in the making, Jon, Keith and I were heading to Black Tusk! Jon, Keith and had I climbed Mt Kilimanjaro together last year, and Keith and Ang and I did the West Coast Trail earlier this summer; so it was an awesome group of people to be going with!



I can now without a doubt say that Black Tusk - http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/black-tusk/ - in Garibaldi Provincial Park, B.C., is easily the most beautiful overnight hike you will ever go on! It has it all! Wooded paths, creeks, views, meadows filled with wildflowers, birds, deer, the most beautiful blue/turquoise lake you will ever see, the gorgeous evergreen trees, snow capped mountains... everything!



It was 9km to Garibaldi Lake, and then 6 to the end of the trail at Black Tusk (...and another km if you wanted to see some more!) and then return to Garibaldi lake for the night, so all up 22km the first day and 9km the second back to the Parking lot; so 31km overall.



We left bright and early on Saturday Morning... just after 6am the guys arrived to pick me up as we hit the Sea to Sky Highway towards Whistler. A quick stop off in Squamish we arrived into the parking lot to find the upper lot already 3/4 full and people everywhere! Wow! And it wasn&apos;t even 8.30!



We made the final adjustments, paid our $10 camping fee each and hit the trail! The trail was really well maintained and easy to walk along as we meandered through the pretty woods alongside Rubble Creek for the first few kilometres before the switchbacks began! We had wondered why there was this random diagonal on the map, but fairly soon we worked it out. The switchbacks! :-)



It was quite a steep elevation gain, but the trail was so nice to walk on it wasn&apos;t a challenge! We called it a &apos;mini West Coast&apos; as we crossed tiny creeks, little bridges and mini fallen trees! All on a much smaller scale!



The waterfalls down the side of the mountain were super pretty as we passed them before we had our first lookout out to the right. And wow! Straight across from us was a massive peak with a huge rockslide down it!



We hit the junction and decided to go the Garibaldi Lake way over the Taylor Meadows route and continued our hike. Within a few minutes we were so glad we had made that decision as in front of us a crystal clear, bright, bright blue lake emerged from behind the trees. I couldn&apos;t believe it had just popped out of nowhere as we paralled the edge for a while as I stopped to take pictures practically every clearing. It was stunning!



Continuing on in the woods we soon began the descent down to the campsite at Garibaldi Lake. As the path opened out at the bottom our jaws practically hit the floor. A massive expanse of bright blue lake, ringed by picture perfect trees and snow capped mountains. It was unbelievable. Like nothing I had ever seen! It was the most amazing awesome surprise! Or as Jon said, it was so perfect it looked fake!



We crossed the bridge over the narrowed channel of the Lake and carefully balanced our way down the side of the lake&apos;s edge on the rock stepping stones as not to dip our feet into the frosty cold water! Continuing along the side we came across the Garibaldi Lake campground where we were to drop our packs and spend the night. We were on track with a time of about four hours and we were pleasantly surprised at the facilities as the campsites were all well aid out and connected by trails, there were several nice clean drop toilets, complete with toilet paper (!!!!), and a large cabin with several picnic tables and a bench for preparing and eating meals and then hanging your food on the overhead ropes overnight to keep the bears away. There were also a few picnic tables right on the edge of the lake so you could dine with the most amazing million dollar view. It was brilliant!



We were glad we had set off early as most of the really good campsites with views and boardwalks to pitch tents on were gone, but we found a nice big one in a convenient location to the hut and bathrooms which was nice. Pitching our tents, stacking on the clothes to combat the already chilly air and having delicious bagel sandwiches with the works courtesy of Ang&apos;s Gourmet Catering we set off for Black Tusk!



The path took us through some gorgeous meadows with the most spectacular views in every direction, stunning snow capped mountains beside and behind us, the gorgeous blue Garibaldi lake to our right and very soon we could also see the jagged black peak of Black Tusk ahead of us - our goal for the afternoon!



We crossed a few little bubbling creeks, mini waterfalls, and across a few rockslides. A little bird also accompanied us along the way, popping out of trees at various stages along the hike!



There were fewer and fewer trees, less and less flowers, soon the grass was gone, and there was nothing but rocks... and snow!!! Yup!! Now we were high! Black Tusk is 2,319 m, with an elevation gain of 1740 meters.



It was super fun going and reaching all the different views as we arrived at the peak and spun around, admiring the amazing view in all directions around us. Beautiful!! We saw the &apos;Caution. End of maintained trail. Climbing Black Tusk is not recommended due to loose and falling rock&apos; sign... looked at each other and decided we had not come all this way to stop here!



Due to reports from other climbers we had brought our helmets and so ditched our backpacks with Ang who was chilling at the base and Jon, Keith and I headed up! We firstly crossed a giant patch of slippery snow before we hit the scree. Wow. You literally slid 2 steps backwards for every one forward you took! And there were these random patches that looked like solid dirt, but when you stood in them, they turned into ankle deep sinkholes of this weird oozing, bubbling mud that sucked you in! Keith found this out the hard way as the rest of us really watched our step from then on in!



We continued up and up before reaching an edge near to the base of the Black Tusk. As we crested we were hit with a ferocious freezing cold wind that threatened to send us flying, but even that could not dampen the words of amazement we spoke as we slowly spun in 360&apos; taking in the most amazing views around us. The whole landscape had suddenly opened up and we could see for miles and miles in each direction, the turquoise blue waters of Garibaldi lake, the snow capped mountain ranges extending as far as the eye could see, the snow ridges and the summit of Black Tusk behind us. It was absolutely stunning as we stood taking it all in... before we slowly started to freeze and had no choice but to descend and get out of the wind!



There was the opportunity for us to continue on and climb to the very summit of Black Tusk, but with the ferocious icy wind, the fact we were running out of time before dark, the climb was an unmarked trail on loose, crumbly and dangerous lava rock, and we already had THE most amazing view possible, we very slowly began our descent, slip sliding down the scree and snow back to the trail.



Whilst we were up there, Jon had spent some time doing a 360&apos; panorama shot with his camera which looked amazing so I cannot wait to see it and post so everyone can see why I am saying this is the most amazing and beautiful hike ever! :-)



As we returned back along the trail, we again saw the little bird that had been following us and some nice fat pheasants running around! We then literally walked within a couple of metres of a mother deer and her two little fawn who were quite content to stand there and eat the grass, oblivious to us! So awesome!!



The walk back was equally as stunning and we made good time back to the campsite at Garibaldi Lake, cooking dinner with the million dollar views on the picnic tables by the Lake by 6.30pm.



We had a delicious Salmon Chowder and Triscuit crackers as we watched the dusk arrive and the snow glow in the dark on the mountains around us.



We had been SO ridiculously lucky with the weather all day. Rain was expected, but it had stayed away, even though the clouds had started to gather, to give us a perfect day. We knew it could not last though as we dug trenches around our tents and bunkered in for the night! At 8.30pm! :-) And in the early hours of the morning it began! Softly at first, but then torrential downpours and a terrible wind ripping through the trees that had us lying awake hoping like hell none of the trees came down on us!! Luckily all was well and good and we awoke to a break in the rain that allowed us enough time to quickly pack up, and get into the hut to cook our delicious berry porridge breakfast made with fresh lake water (well, boiled fresh lake water!) before it began again!



We layered up in our most waterproof layers and hit the trail! Ang made us laugh in her bright red and green rainwear looking like a Christmas elf! Luckily it was so well maintained that the water ran off and there was very little mud to slow us down. But I did learn it was time for a new rain jacket as it started to suddenly get very cold and wet! There was a bunch of crazy people out trail running too!! Full on!



Our calves were starting to get tight from the constant uphill yesterday and the constant downhill today, but it was still a lovely walk... until we came across a large tree that had fallen across the path and a few others that were splintered and we realised how lucky we had been with the wind and our campsite the night before! phew!



We arrived at the parking lot in about 3 hours and managed to throw all our wet stuff in the boot and jump into the car just as the torrential downpour arrived. We had been So lucky with the weather! Sure we were a little wet, but overall it was the most amazingly beautiful hike and perfect weekend! Do it! :-) But maybe not in Peak season... it was quite busy at the campsite and it is the very end of season. It would be crazy in peak!
 
The final push! BC Place, Vancouver, Canada

2011-09-26 to 2011-10-29


The final week was absolutely Crazy out!!! There was just a week to go before the Grand Opening weekend of the newly renovated BC Place Stadium with both a Canadian Football League Game, followed by a Whitecaps Soccer Game!


It was like a freeway the amount of forklifts, golf carts, scissor lifts and you name it, running around the corridors. There was literally a person every metre every where you turned and a massive buzz in the air. We were close…. We just had to get there!! Over 5000 workers and 1 800 000 man hours!!!

Right outside our offices was a giant foodcourt and it seemed like one day we walked out and it had literally entirely changed! It had gone from a mess of construction materials into a fully functioning foodcourt, signs up, TV’s installed and playing, and all barriers gone. It was quite weird and exciting at the same time.


One night Michelle and I had to stay late and do some serious scanning and photocopying of binders for the occupancy. Sure, it was a crappy job, but everyone was pitching in to do what they could to help out and get us over the line. And we were getting paid for it. But then as well, we got given a spa gift voucher to say thanks. How nice is that!!


The last week was all hands on deck regardless of your job to assist the other trades that needed help. I spent most of my last week out of the office, (which was a nice change!) picking up building materials from the seat areas so the cleaners could come through and clean, picking up all leftover bolts etc that could be re-used, adjusting the seat arm rests with allan keys and also staying late, hours into the night glueing numbers on seats. Harry, (another admin team member that started on the same day as I), and I were a team, him glueing with the caulking gun and I following attaching the seat numbers. If you sit anywhere from 101–111 chances are it is my fingerprint in that glue! :-)


Pizza was given to everyone for dinner those nights and I had to laugh as I walked past the field office in the days following this and saw a stack of pizza boxes literally taller than I was, waiting for the garbage to go out!


With the new retractable roof, a small problem was encountered with pigeons coming inside. As a result they brought a Hawk in to chase out the pigeons! Super cool way to do it that’s for sure!


We also had one last opportunity to head out and see the stadium from the Catwalk–the walkway up into the roof where the building, maintenance and repairs are done from. It was amazing to see the differences from when we had walked it on our arrival, just under 2 months ago to now. Then it was a total construction site, building debris and rubble around, cranes, and besides the building shell, nothing that looked like a stadium. (See my blog from the first week of August 2011…ummm when I post it!!! Sorry!! Should be soon. The pictures are there though! :-) )


Now, it was a world apart. The glowing green turf, freshly painted lines, the amazing new lighting and sound systems, the GIANT videoscreens and scoreboards. The Ribbon board around the stadium showing team flags, the lighting with the team colours, the brand new seats, signs and everything! It was an amazing transformation! Seeing it all from the birds eye view above, I could hardly believe it had happened in such a short amount of time!


Everyone was quite tired though, pulling some long hours, and looked a lot like death when you saw them! (the people out in the field that is, not us in the office!) so it was a giant relief as Friday rolled around and we were all ready to go!


The teams that were playing on the weekend came in for training runs on the new pitch, and as our offices are right near the locker rooms I ran into them a few times. I was absolutely stunned when I first saw the BC Lions team–these were professional athletes in the Canadian Football League and they were nothing short of obese! Their giant beer guts proudly displayed through their shirts pulled tight across their stomachs! I could not believe it! Turns out only the Offensive part of the team are fit…the defense, or‘blockers’are these big guys whose aim is to stop the other team and apparently need a lot of oomph behind them! I am still shaking my head though…professional athletes!!!


It was exciting to be out there as the Lions ran onto the pitch for their first training session, media and all sorts of big wigs in suits out to see it happen…and finally, the opening we had all been waiting so long for was near!


It does not mean the end of the project though. Although the stadium is effectively done to the point where games can be successfully held, there is still enough work behind the scenes to keep me employed until November.


There have been a lot of Media articles in the past few days as well ; two of the bigger ones -


http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Place+hearts/5446492/story.html‘Since it opened nearly 30 years ago, BC Place Stadium has been at the centre of activity. It&apos;s welcomed royalty and the world&apos;s best athletes - and changed the face of the downtown core’and discusses the history of the stadium.

http://www.vancouversun.com/Impressive+roof+roomy+seats/5446495/story.html‘Impressive roof and roomy seats’- The $563-million renovation of BC Place, featuring the world&apos;s largest cable-supported retractable roof, is complete.

In the year and a half that it has been closed to the public, the main things that have been completed are the brand new retractable roof (the largest of its kind in the world), new massive video screens (the second largest centre hung stadium screen in North America), new concourses, state of the art lighting and sound systems, changing the seating to new, comfier and roomier seats, new concessions (kiosks), and a new turf of the highest grade available (http://bcplace2011.com/ ).

 
Opening Weekend! BC Place, Vancouver, Canada

2011-09-30 to 2011-10-02


Working at BC Place (http://bcplace2011.com/ ), we were all lucky enough to be given tickets to the first soccer and football games to be held in the stadium, so were all super excited! Opening weekend!!


The first game in the newly renovated BC Place was the CFL–Canadian Football League with our home team, the BC Lions playing the Edmonton Eskimos (http://bclions.com/game-day ) .


It was an exciting atmosphere as we arrived to a street party in the Terry Fox plaza just in front of the entrance with music and competitions, face painting, food, and, as with Canucks Hockey Team, the opportunity to sign up for some kind of credit card that (as a foreigner) I am not entitled to, but they don’t realize until they process it, and in the meantime we get a free Lions shirt! Nice!


Harry (who I work with), his girlfriend Charli, my friend Liz and I headed in the gates, all sporting our new Lions supporter shirts! We had our bags searched, I had my water bottle sniffed and we were in!


It was an odd feeling to be walking around with just regular clothes after wearing full protective equipment everywhere we have been here within the stadium for the past few months! Our seats were in section 430, Row KK so right up the back, or as the tickets said,‘Upper touchdown zone’. So, the nosebleed section! But the view was still amazing and we had the giant screen also to watch concurrently. There were bright orange pom poms in every single seat cup holder which was awesome as the whole stadium waved them around.


A GIANT Canadian flag was unfurled, the anthem was sung, fireworks were off, the cheerleaders were out, the teams were introduced and ran through the giant blow up lions head and cheerleader lines, the grand opening of the roof happened, which did look really cool with the fairy lights on the beams and the dark sky out behind it. Even better, there was no rain, no leaks, and it was game on! Hmmm. Yessssssss. The CFL is…. How do I put this…slooooooooow! There are about a trillion different rules which not even Canadians know and the time stops for everything. So you look at the clock, and there are 12 mins to go. About 5 minutes later you look again and there are 11.34 mins to go! Argh!


There were a lot of competitions and giveaways with a blimp flying around the stadium dropping gifts, cars driving round the outside of the pitch with people throwing towels into the crowd, a lucky seat number car winner (they won a brand new Nissan! Or Knee-Sahn as it was pronounced!) a camera that put couples in the audience up on the big screen in a love heart as they had to kiss to determine a winner, games on the pitch between the quarters with a timed zorb ball run, throwing footballs through a target to win cash and lots of music to keep us entertained. And just as well because without the music and pom poms it would have been a long night!


There was a big emphasis on gambling too which I did not expect with several betting competitions being advertised constantly on the big screen by the players.


We were warned throughout the night,‘stay in your seats folks’, there will be an amazing half time spectacle! And so we waited…. And then we cringed, shook our heads in amazement and laughed as the cheerleaders kind of twirled in circles without really doing much, 4 stages with a random person and instrument on each, some girls waving in outfits that made them look really dumpy, and a really cheesy song‘raise the roof, raise the roof, raise the roof!’as it showed pictures of the construction of the stadium on the big screen. And then it was over as we waited the next ten minutes for the game to start again!


The final quarters got interesting though as the game got close, there were touchdowns, goals kicked, some big plays, giant runs down the field and the highlights some of those‘typical’type plays you always see in American college football movies! It certainly is all about the quarterback as we heard his name called constantly over the loudspeakers! Geroy!


We also got free food and drink vouchers to head to the concession stands (AKA Kiosks to the rest of the world…I have no idea why they are called that…!) which was a nice surprise.


The final score was 33-24 in favor of the Lions, with an attendance of 50,213. The crowd was great, they really made the night, totally getting into it and a fantastic atmosphere…so a first night success!

We were also looking forward to the Soccer on Sunday! The Vancouver Whitecaps FC were playing Portland Timbers for their first home game at the Stadium.
The lines from the Football had been wiped of the pitch, the soccer lines added, the‘soccer curtain’which shielded the upper seats (which are not used for soccer matches) was in and it was time!


I could hear drumming and singing from my apartment as the Whitecaps fans marched through the streets of the city down to the stadium. I arrived at the stadium just as the last of them arrived, dressed bright in the Whitecaps colours and waving flags.


It was already a more upbeat atmosphere to the CFL game as I stood in Terry Fox plaza and watched everyone around me enjoying all the stalls at the street party whilst I waited for my cousins Kay and Elmer who were also coming to the game. Unfortunately their seats were a little further away so I waved goodbye as I met Dana and headed in. We had great seats, Sec 216, row N…Also the seats 107 and 108…numbers I had laboriously glued during the week!


The Whitecaps supporters had gone in the day before and elastic banded little whitecaps flags to each and every seat for the spectators to wave throughout the game. Pretty amazing dedication! It was an interesting insight for me as after the Lions game I had wondered how they (and the orange poms poms previously)had gotten there. I had no idea it was fans volunteering their time to support their team! Awesome hey!


We were right behind the players bench and perfect view of the super giant screen! The soccer had a super professional opening with a marching band, flags, fireworks and the National Anthems that the whole stadium sung along with. And kickoff! Immediately the Portland Supporters and Whitecaps Supporters, situated at opposite corners of the pitch began their chants. I was amazed at how they stood, waving, clapping and cheering throughout the entire game! Non stop!! Dedication!!


They also had drum sections going at various times which was pretty cool. It was a totally different atmosphere to the CFL and we were kind of pleased when half time rolled around without some kind of embarrassing show as the pitch just lay empty for the teams to return!


Even funnier were the catch cries flashing up on the stadium screen and on signs around the stadium.‘Drama’one of them as Dana and I constantly laughed at the players getting a slight knock and then going down like a heap and lying there until they were noticed…then got up, attempted to get some kind of penalty and then continued on fine. Too funny!!


It was also interesting to see the amount of injuries that people played through as well with our team alone of the things that we could see, there was one guy in an arm cast and another in a moulded Perspex face shield to protect a recently broken nose.

The game was much better, more fluid, faster and much easier to follow than the CFL that is for sure... Unfortunately the Whitecaps went down 1-0, but awesome to be a part of!

 
The Turkey Coma - A Canadan Thanksgiving, Vancouver, Canada

2011-10-06 to 2011-10-09


Not yet finished!!!!! Sorry!!! After spending a large amount of time in North America over the years, I was finally able to be here to co-incide with the Thanksgiving Holiday. One of the (many!) things I love about Canada is the fact that there is a public holiday every month! Awesome! :-)

So the second Monday In November is when the amazing Thanksgiving Weekend falls and I was also lucky enough to be asked to spend the weekend with my super cousins Kay and Elmer and their family (I stayed with them when I first arrived in Canada).

 I headed straight out there after work drinks on the friday afternoon to chill out and baking the baking frenzy Saturday Morning! Kay, Glyn (another cousin from NZ) and I all jumped into the kitchen and began preparing ....

 
Two pound burgers and the cutest dinner ever. Vancouver, Canada

2011-10-14 to 2011-10-17


 
Other fun in the city! Finishing work and watching the Canucks play. Vancouver, Canada

2011-10-26 to 2011-10-27

Harry, his girlfriend Charli, Liz and I also decided to splash out and

get tickets to see the Canucks play! Since we had all arrived in

Vancouver everywhere we went we had been bombarded with

advertisements, pictures, stories, articles, shows, games, apparel,

flags, posters and you name it about them! And having been here

through the playoffs for last season.... Just four months ago!!!! :-)

Seeing the Canuck- frenzy that possessed the city, and seeing the

players on TV every other night, it was just something we had to do!

And now, at the start of the season before the tickets got any more

expensive!! :-)



We had tickets to Rogers Arena, the home stadium, just a few blocks

from me and the game versus the St Louis Blues (26 Oct). Sure, we had the

nosebleed section, but the view was fantastic still! Both teams were

warming up as we arrived and it was exciting to see the speed of the

drills and the players whizzing around the ice.



The national anthems were sung as the entire crowd joined in on &apos;O

Canada&apos; and the ice was bathed in bright red and White of the image of a

fluttering maple leaf from the flag.



Music was playing, pumping everyone up and light shows were being

played across the ice and surrounding screens, some pretty cool images, players faces, random funky patterns, and we were ready!



Pretty much everyone in the stadium was decked out in the Canucks blue, green and white colours as the game began and it was definitely all we were after as the big name Canucks – the Sedins, Burrows, Kesler, Bieksa; hit the ice and got the game going! There were some good plays and shots on goal, but alas we were not the better team and made a lot of bad shots and errors.



As in all good hockey games there were a few fights, a few almost fights and a few penalties to keep us entertained. The crowd was good at times, getting behind the team and cheering the ‘go, Canucks, go’ chant when it got exciting, but most of the time people just sat there which was a little disappointing as I was expecting a little more atmosphere! I think the fans are quite fickle though so there probably is a lot more when we are winning!!



They had a team of tiny kids playing in between the 2nd and 3rd periods which was super cute, and between the periods, there were skaters that came out with broom kind of devices to sweep up all the shaved off ice! Random fans were put up on the big screen in the middle throughout the game and it was so awesome to see how many people of all ages were fully decked out in supporter outfits and, face paint, you name it and up cheering, dancing and enjoying themselves.



The final score was 3-0 to the Blues, and so many ‘fans’ just got up and walked out when the third goal was scored in the last period. Pretty bad supporters!!



Super fun! If only the tickets were not so expensive I would be there a lot more!





My job at BC place was also coming to an end, the majority of the

construction was complete and the company was moving off site!



I hate packing! And here I was at it again! Both at work and home

concurrently! Double winner! :-)



Some of the people&apos;s views to the move of the work offices cracked me

up. So there was two years worth of &apos;crap&apos; for the sake of a better

term that needed to be sorted, labelled for storage if they were

important documents, and packed in less than a week from when we got

the drop dead leaving date! No pressure! Some people got right on it

and into a packing frenzy. Others, like one Project Manager in

particular seemed absolutely totally oblivious to the fact that

anything was going in around him as he continued his regular daily

undertakings, printing documents, working away, whilst the remainder

of the office continued in a whirlwind around him.



It cracked me up every time I walked past and looked in his office to

see the stacks of stuff and binders. Even more so as all the document

boxes were used and there was only the large moving boxes when he did

decide to join the party!



I have never seen so much stuff!!! There were over two full pallets of

folders alone as they kept being emptied and piling up in front of our

eyes. And Sooo much paper!! Bins and bins and bins full!



It was a crazy day on Friday as we tried to quickly finish our work

before the network was shut down and the movers moved in! They were

literally snapping at our heals, taking stuff the second it had been

packed and labelled. They sure wanted us out of there! We had to

label everything with different coloured stickers depending on their

end destination... I hope everything ended up where it was supposed to

go!



We were all taken out for a really nice lunch at the Yaletown Brew

Club for the final day which was awesome as we knocked off at 12 and

headed down. We had a delicious meal and I even got to try a pumpkin

creme brûlée. Winner! Pumpkin custard! Delicious!! We need to take

this trend of pumpkin as sweets back to Oz! So good!





I am definitely going to miss being able to roll out of bed, chuck on

some jeans, a t-shirt and hoodie and walk the two minutes to work!

Coming home at lunch and being home 5 mins after you finish work. It

gives you so many more hours in the day!!!



No make up, work clothes or shoes, and chilled out people... Ahh

working on a construction site definitely has its advantages! Sure,

there was the dust, dirt, wearing ear plugs at the desk, endless

drilling, banging, you name it, and having to dress in full protective

equipment to walk across the hall each time you wanted to go to the

bathroom, but hey! I&apos;d take it anyday! :-)



I am sure going to miss it especially when I have to get up at 5.30am

to get out to the main office at Richmond for the final week of work.

Yes, can&apos;t complain, it is nice to have employment, but really?!

5.30am?!! Over an hour commuting?!! Not fun!!!!



Even funnier when no one remembered to pass on the memo to the new

girl that it was back to business casual dress and not whatever you

want site clothes! After day one I figured oh well, damage done! and

just stayed in jeans for the few days there anyway. Much nicer! I did

upgrade the hoodie though! :-)
 
Happy Halloween! Vancouver, Canada

2011-10-28 to 2011-10-29

This week was also Halloween and it was crazy to see the amount of

effort people went to! There were decorated shops and houses

everywhere, entire stores dedicated to costumes and decorations

appeared, and practically the dollar store stock transformed into

Halloween!



The Saturday, the 29th was the date for Thrill The World where

all over the world people gathered dressed as Zombies to dance to

Michael Jackson&apos;s &apos;Thriller&apos; in a type of organised flash mob form to

raise money for the Food Bank ( http://www.ttwvancouver.com/ ).



Rehearsals had been held in several locations (including conveniently

at the Yaletown Roundhouse, just a few blocks from me!) for weeks

leading up to the event, teaching participants the dance moves. It was

super fun, but a challenge as they put the music on full speed and

there were flailing arms everywhere as people tried to keep up. The

cue words made me laugh though... Zombie walk and zombie walk....

Shoulder shrug nothing walk, shoulder shrug.... Booty shake, booty

shake!! Now just have to remember when there is no one yelling those

words!!



I had a Red Cross Course on for Managing Shelters and Reception

Centres which was super fun, but alas ran late as I rushed onto the

skytrain and rushed home to get ready for Thrill The World event. I

was so late that I had only enough time to quicky throw my Halloween

dress over my clothes, grab my zombie mask and run out of the door! I

bolted down to Yaletown, signed in and had a few minutes to look

around and check out some of the amazing costumes there. People had

definitely gone all out with zombie gladiators, brides, clowns,

business people, movie characters, you name it! And of course, many a

Michael Jackson!



There were dozens of video cameras and photographers there as the

people I was with and I were filmed... For Chinese tv we found out

later!



Hundreds of us all got down onto the floor as the music began and the

zombies began to wake up and follow the choreographed routine in

unison! Luckily there were dozens of people that knew the dance really

well that we could easily follow, especially when the music stopped

just before the end, we kept dancing, it then started where it had

left off and we had to quickly back up and do the last section again!



It was super fun as the massive crowd applauded and we all split up

and continued on our way! I met up with Harry and Charli, who were

also there in the crowds of hundreds, and checked out their face paint

which had been done by Vancouver Art students volunteering their time

to &apos;zombie-ify&apos; everyone who could get done there early which was

pretty awesome!



Apparently there were 434 people there dancing as well which was

amazing!! And a record for Vancouver for the annual event. You can&apos;t

pick me out if any of them, but if you type &apos;thrill the world

Vancouver 2011&apos; into YouTube you can see what was involved! A link to

one is here ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfPzPG3twRM&amp;feature;=related )



I had been unwell so wasn&apos;t up for a big night as I donned my Raggedy

Ann outfit and headed out to meet Ryan (a Hawaiian hula girl) and

Christie (Christmas) for a drink. It was amazing some of the costumes

out! Everyone was dressed and some people had gone to such a lot of

effort with full on masterpieces! There were everything you could

think of! And more! Describing would not even justify the amount of

variety there was!



It seemed to be an excuse for girls to go out in their underwear

though with 95% of the outfits nothing but slutty! Clearly I was well

overdressed in my actual above knee dress!



It was even funnier the next morning when I was out and about early

and saw people doing the walk of shame home in their full costume get

up. My favourite was a guy dressed as a cow trying to act

inconspicuous leaning against the wall waiting for the seabus home!

Priceless! Not about to blend with that outfit in the morning

sunshine!! :-)



And then the actual day of Halloween was here (31 Oct)!! Although it felt like

it had been coming for so long with the leadup over the weekend. It

was so lovely to see everything get even more festive with all the

Jack o lanterns out on doorstops and in shop windows! Yep! Just like

the movies!! So cool!! :-)



And even more so, there was nothing cuter than hundreds of dressed up

kids and parents of all ages roaming the streets with their little

pumpkin baskets to go trick or treating!! I was mesmerised!! No photos

though sorry, I feel bad taking any of random children!





The amusement park, PNE also did a halloween special, called Fright

Night! A group of us were heading there to celebrate Ryan&apos;s birthday

and be spooked (22 Oct)! It certainly looked the part as we arrived to the dim

glow of lights through the smoky haze, and were patted down and bags

searched. Ryan sparked a commotion over carrying a childs toy cap gun

and was almost refused entry, but luckily all turned out okay in the

end!



We joined the queues and jumped on (well... Maybe forty five minutes

later jumped on!) the old wooden rollercoaster with the pull down

double bar across the seats that allowed way to much room to move

around, up and down, and slide everywhere as we rode! Super fun though!



We waded through the thick smoke, barely able to see several metres

ahead of us at times as people dressed as zombies, possessed clowns,

murderers and you named it roamed between us! My favourite was a guy

covered in blood chasing people with a chainsaw. And not just a

little, but hunting them down for up to 50 metres, reving his chainsaw

and chasing them around until they were genuinely shrieking in fear.

It was awesome!! Hours of entertainment!!!



We went through our first haunted house and it was 3D! We were all

provided the blue and red glasses to really freak us out inside! It

was really clever with all sorts of different rooms, hallways and

corridors with varying themes, special effects and different actors

and props to scream, scare and jump out at you! My favourite was a

room that was totally black with fluro coloured polka dots covering

everything and random shapes throughout it. I was just trying to

figure out what on earth it was as I walked through when the wall

jumped out and screamed at me, clearly causing the same reaction back

from me!!! Only it wasn&apos;t the wall, but actors dressed entirely in the

same spots that you could not see!!!! at all!!! Crazy!!! Crazy

scary!!! :-)







We lined up forever to get on the high swinging chair ride which was

also super fun, but really cold whizzing through the icy air!



Luckily by then it was almost midnight and the crowds were starting to

disperse so we were straight on the big rollercoaster with no lines at

all! Score!!! And then backing up to ride again as it was empty!!

Double score!



Things were starting to shut down but we quickly got into the line for

another haunted house, an insane asylum. There were rooms of

splattered blood and people hanging from nooses in the ceiling, and

crazy random stuff that you had no idea what was going on and it was

scary! I was ready to get out! And luckily we then came to a black

curtain looking thing with a gap in the centre to walk through. Only

the curtain was solid! It was like a black blow up mattress or pillow

tunnel you had to turn sideways and force your way through forever! It

was pitch black, claustrophobic, and you could neither see another

person, the end or the beginning!! Scary!! It squashed you tight

and you had to keep forcing your way forward!! It felt like it would

never end as I burst my way out the other end and took a deep breath,

only to find out the haunted house was still going!!!! It was really

well done, and actually scary and kept you on your toes the entire way

which I was pretty impressed with as I thought they would be a little

bit lame and for kids!
 
The luckiest day!! Vancouver, Canada

2011-10-30 to 2011-11-07

So, I randomly woke up on Thursday and headed in to work to find that

my work friend Harry and I had won tickets to Judas Priest Epitaph Tour.



Too funny! But it didn&apos;t stop there! I then won a Garmin GPS Navigator

in an end of project prize draw, found out Cam had booked zip lining

for us on the weekend, and then got home at lunch to find the package

I had been waiting weeks for and needed for the next day had arrived!

Whoa! And it hadn&apos;t even hit lunch!!! The best day ever!! I

immediately hit up 7-11 to buy a lottery ticket as I figured if anyone

was going to win, on a day like this it would be me!



Unfortunately it was not to be, but I did win a free ticket for next

weeks draw! I must be winning then!! :-)





So Cam had organised Zip lining up at Grouse Mountain for Sunday as we

jumped in the car for the short drive up (http://www.grousemountain.com/zipline ). We caught the cable car up

and dressed into our snow gear in preparation for the cold and

inclement weather.



There was already snow covering the ground too!! And it&apos;s not even

winter yet! Going to be a good season! :-)



We layered up, got our safety talk, jumped in the harnesses and were

ready! And luckily enough we were the only people booked on and so had

a private tour! Sweet!



We carried our handles up to the first of five runs, got attached and

learnt the brace position for the impact at the far end. And we were

off flying through the foggy White air! Super fun!!



The second line had the steepest angle without straightening out again

which would leave us with the biggest impact of the day. In order to

mitigate this, we had to zipline in the &apos;star&apos; position to attempt to

reduce our speed and consequent hit at the other end! It definitely

felt like we were flying as we whizzed through the air. The fog was

quite thick and it was scary being at speed at not being able to see

the end or know how far you had until impact! Luckily as we zoomed in,

it became clearer and I listened out for our guide yelling for us to

get into the brace position for impact. I couldn&apos;t hear anything but

could see him miming pulling his knees up so I assumed the

position..... And SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holy crap!!!!!!!!!!!!



I tried to catch my breath and shake out the pain in my right

shoulder. Whoa!!!!!!! I looked across at Cam as he attempted to move

his neck and we both looked at each other wide eyed. Wow! Nothing

they had said had prepared us for that!!!



They told us the oldest person to do it was an 87 year old woman!!!

Crazy!! I hope I am still doing those awesome kind of things when I

hit that age!



The next was a super fun and pretty line across a lake as we stood on

the edge and could then jump off to begin instead of just being

seated. The soft impact at this time was a much more pleasant ending

as we re-bounded back off again.



We then had a fun four wheel drive up to the top of the mountain for

the final two lines.



The fourth was the fastest line there was and you could reach top

speeds of 60-80km/hr. Pretty crazy! It was scary whizzing through the

fog and not being able to see the end or the ground, judge where you

were, or how fast you were going! Pretty fast though. Fast enough for

the glasses to totally fog up!



We could assume the bullet position on this one - in an attempt to

reach higher speeds - laying as straight and aero dynamically as

possible. Cam won this race, although I do have to say I did chicken

out just before the end and go to the seated position so I didn&apos;t get

that intense impact of the earlier zipline!



We had a bit of a trek uphill across the snow covered ground to reach

the final zipline. We climbed the tower up and got attached. Hmmmm a

fair bit of a drop off this one!!! It was the highest at 70m off the ground en route. There was a little bit more

hesitation before the exit off here!



This was the longest line and awesome fun as we flew down. I can’t seem to find how long it actually is though, but long!! It was a bit surreal to be flying through

the misty white air totally engulfing us before you began to see the

landings at the far end emerge.



SO much fun!!!



We had another fun four wheel drive back to the start of the zip

lining, and walked back to catch the cable car down the mountain.



A super awesome day! And it was to continue as we were off to the

Judas Priest concert (30 Oct)! And in our Judas Priest t-shirts as well after

Cam had found some at the Rock Shop!! I was laughing as we walked

there and someone saw them and yelled out to us &apos;Judas Priest!!!&apos;

Little did they know I had never even heard of them until a few days

ago!



We met Liz and headed straight into Rogers Arena where we were lucky

enough to be in private suite 227 for the evening! Sweet!



We had a private bathroom, lounge room area with kitchenette, large

screen tv and large super comfy chairs with a perfect unrestricted

view straight down onto the stage! So good!!



Black Label Society were just starting as we arrived and holy crap! I

have never heard anything so loud!!! I immediately got my ear plugs

in, and even through that it was loud!! It was crazy!! There was no

way we could even hear anything anyone said and actually had to resort

to typing on our phones and showing each other to communicate! As Cam

pointed out though, I guess when there was literally an entire wall of

speakers as the back of the stage, it was going to be loud.



That said we had absolutely no idea what they were saying, no idea

what the songs were about and we couldn&apos;t even understand a single

word they said!!! I have never seen anything like it!!!!!



The lead guitar player did a massive, massive solo that was ridiculous!

I wish I had timed, but I would say for sure over ten minutes! And his

fingers constantly moving at high speed the entire time! If our ears

were not in the stages of bleeding I would have said it was highly

impressive!!! Even more so at various times he managed to song, play

guitar, and head bang with his long long hair going everywhere without

even missing a beat!!



We could really smell weed as we watched puffs of smoke haze over the crowd. Definately a rock concert!! 

Soon the smoke machines were turned on though and it became one giant

haze!



We had a prime vantage point to watch the audience also and I was

absolutely amazed and mesmerised by the fans. They managed to somehow

Head bang through the entire song in unison with their mates and

calmly end without even being dizzy or disoriented. There were many

with long flowing locks that flew everywhere, but in total sync! There

also seemed to be a method to do this as they simultaneously head

banged and then stopped and raised their fists and went back to the

head banging!



At the end of songs or particularly poignant sections within them the

crowd all raised their hands to form the synonymous &apos;rock on&apos; sign

which looked amazing silhouetted against the lights of the stage and

surrounded by a smokey haze.



The Epitaph tour signage came out and you could feel the atmosphere

change with excitement as the crowd began to anticipate their arrival.

And they burst onto the stage, lasers, lights, smoke and firecrackers

were all there along with their amazing costumes that were exactly as

I had imagined with the tight pants, a shiny cape on one, lots of

black and chains!



The music was a much more acceptable level of loud (ear plugs still

in though!!) and we could hear the words and differentiate between the

music which was nice. The lead singer was also quite amazing,

managing song after song to scream at what seemed like the top of his

lungs, in tune, and never losing it!! Impressive!!



I also loved when Judas Priest began a slow Ballard, hundreds of

people all got out their lighters and slowly waved them, the entire

stadium interspersed with little orange lights glowing.



It was a really nice atmosphere and a mass of all ages there totally

getting into it and enjoying the concert and it was totally awesome to

see.



I also found out that Judas Priest formed back in 1969 and have been

performing ever since!!!! for 42 years!!! How amazing is that!!! They

have also been named the second greatest rock band of all time after

Black Sabbath which is a pretty amazing achievement too! Which makes

much more sense how everyone I mentioned the concert seemed to know

of them!



Although I can&apos;t say I will be breaking down any doors to get to

another Heavy Metal concert soon, I absolutely totally loved the

opportunity and experience!! Any more free tickets.... send them my

way please! :-)
 
Away!!! Off to Texas and then living and studying in an Ashram, Quebec, Canada

2011-11-08 to 2011-11-17

Hmm somehow I managed to lose the post I just did so am writing this quickly in the hope the last one turns up again!



So I am off! again! I have been busy trying to get in as much work as possible before I head off and not work for a few months! It was definitely nice to say goodbye to full time work as on Tuesday I head off to Victoria, Texas for my friend Taysha (from summer camp USA)&apos;s wedding and then up to Val Morin, just outside Montreal, Quebec to live and study yoga in an Ashram for a month! (http://www.sivananda.org/camp/ ).



The intensive daily schedule includes two meditation sessions, two yoga classes, two lectures, one hour of service to the ashram community. One day a week is lecture-free.

5:30 am: Wake up

6:00 am: Satsang (Meditation, chanting, lecture)

8:00 am: Asanas and pranayama / How to teach

10:00 am: Brunch

We follow a vegan diet and Meat, fish, eggs, black tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco and drugs are prohibited.



I can&apos;t wait! It is going to be awesome! i love the yoga philosophy, am looking forward to gaining my teacher qualification out of it, and also am hoping this is the healthy living kickstart my body needs to finally shake the chronic fatigue I am still suffering as an after effect of the malaria I had at the start of the year whilst I was in Africa.



It has been a bit crazy as I also was able to sublet my room for when I am away so packing and organising everything away, but so worth it to have the rent paid whilst I am away for sure!!



So I will return to Vancouver in Med December, and probably won&apos;t be able to be online before then, but all is well and talk to you all then!! :-) k xxxxx
 
A Very Texan Wedding y&apos;all, Victoria, Texas, USA

2011-11-09 to 2011-12-12

After a late night attempting to pack for a Texan Wedding, a month living in an Ashram and a week or so sightseeing in Quebec... And then packing everything else I owned up and away ready for the subletter, Fiorella, to move into my room, I jumped into my sleeping bag (my sheets were already washed and packed away!) and bunkered down for a few hours sleep before the alarm went off at 0355h. Ugh! I set 7 alarms I was so worried that I would be so tired I would not wake up, but all was well!



Luckily I have a super easy transit straight on my skytrain line to the airport, so it was great to arrive... And then join the world&apos;s longest queue! If anyone ever remembers dramas I have had with airlines over the years, they seem to be mainly isolated to United... And now Continental and United have joined forces, and here I was, the only airline with a massive queue, the only airline with a combined check in and bag drop line, the only airline with no staff to assist and of course the only airline with forever to wait!



We had to go through customs and immigration and enter the US within the Vancouver airport which I found quite interesting, and there they took me to the special room (with about twenty others!) and confiscated part of my lunch, damn it! I guess it is a way to make the airline money forcing me to buy my snacks from them now!!! :-)



Of course after the bag check fee and every other thing that tried to get money off you for, the entertainment system was also pay to view! Damn it! Bring back the free programming on Air Canada! :-).



We had a lot of turbulance but arrived safely at George Bush International in Houston where thanks to text messaging I managed to find Taysha who had driven up to meet me! So nice!



Taysha was a fellow counsellor from Stone Mountain Adventures in Pennsylvania where I had worked a summer four years ago. I can&apos;t believe how fast time has gone!



I caught the most awesome little train between the terminals, it was so cute, like it should have been taking tourists through some attraction somewhere! I then hit the outside to meet Tay. Wow! Hot!! That is all I can say! Definately not suitable for the winter coat, jeans and boots I was wearing that morning on the way! T shirt, shorts and thongs weather! And sunshine!! Nice!!



We saw the highlights of the city of Houston - The massive, massive 40 000 seat church of Joel Osten ( a popular preacher who had taken over - and fills!! - an ex basketball arena) and headed to Sugar Land to grab a bite at The Cheesecake Factory. Yup, we were definately in Texas as the meals came out ridiculously huge! I had forgotten how everything is bigger in Texas!



We had the most amazing fresh bread and then equally as awesome Thai lettuce wraps. Definately a thumbs up, even if there was enough food to take away to make a second meal!



We picked up Taysha&apos;s wedding dress and then hit the road for the couple of hours back to Victoria. It was almost 15 hours since I had left home by the time we got in so was super glad to arrive and chillax!



We had a super relaxing night in, watching some crazy American reality tv shows about child beauty pagebts, another about people who were such hoaders their houses literally overflowed and you couldn&apos;t even find a pathway through their house, and shows on people who had had near death experiences and survived. It was unbelieveable the stuff on tv!!  And of course a good old catch up!



Over the next few days we had a lot of errands to run to finish off before the big day and so saw a lot of town. I had forgotten how bizarre looking to me the architecture is here - all giant square buildings on large blocks, and so spread out that car is definately the only way you can get around!!



And it was Texan food time!!! Tay cooked traditional &apos;biscuits&apos; for me one morning which came in a can looking container that was actually made of paper that you split on a diagonal, popped out the pre prepared biscuits into the oven, and wallah! Baked scone-y / pastryish type food!



I think we ate Mexican three times a day other days, it is just so common! It is all very tasty, but it seemed all the food has lots of cheese, friedness, and not much greenery anywhere!!



I am definately looking forward to getting to the Ashram and eating lots of fresh veg that is for sure!



I also got the pleasure of spending some time with Claire, Grant and Taysha&apos;s daughter who was born at 10.10 on 10/10/10! Crazy hey!



And now here they were getting married on 11/11/11!



And then Steph arrived!! Our other good friend from Summer Camp!!! Taylor, Tay&apos;s brother had picked her up from the airpot in Houston and delivered her to the house! It was so good to see her and catch up as we got dressed and headed off to the Rehearsal and Rehearsal Dinner.



Taysha and Grant&apos;s wedding was at the First United Methodist Church in Victoria and we all piled in for the rehearsal which went really smoothly! Nice! And then into the cars to head out to dinner!



The rehearsal dinner was beautiful! At the country club, it was such a lovely location and all set up with pretty tables and menu&apos;s for us to choose our meal of fish, chicken or beef, and then a beautiful dessert buffet!



It was lovely to hear all the speeches and enjoy the slide show and chat with the rest of the family.



I had stayed with Taysha after summer camp all those years ago and her family were all so lovely that it was such a pleasure to see them all again!



It was funny too, people I met four years ago on a night out in town were now all married with babies!



After the dinner we all headed to Grant&apos;s parents house where there was a barman and outdoor fire for us all to sit around and enjoy for the rest of the night. Brrr though! Luckily there was that fire as Steph and i huddled super close, anazed the day could go from singlet weather to winter coat westher so quickly!



And wow. Epic days. I don&apos;t think we got home until after 3.30am and then were out of the house by 0830 to get the preparations done for the big day!!! Ahhhhh sleep please!!!! :-)



Yup, definately Tough to get up next morning, but it was made slightly easier by drive through Mexican breakfast tacos at El Rodeo!!! Yup, Mexican everywhere!! But we definately needed that protein boost to get us going!



We were setting up the reception at the warehouse, the oldest building in town and it was so lovely with its old wooden structures and spacious hall.



We began to grab the boxes of linens and cover the tables with the tablecloths and decorations, Taysha directing us on the colour scheme.



Unfortunately there was a mix up with the linens and what was delivered wasn&apos;t what Taysha had ordered. There was a mini crisis as the lady couldn&apos;t get the right ones out so it was a stressful start for Tay, but it looked stunning in the end.



Transformed from an empty room to gorgeous white, gold and ivory and with White chair covers and gold Bows on all the chairs. That took some serious time that&apos;s for sure.... But it was beautiful!!



We finished a few more errands and then headed home to get ready for the Wedding. Sleep? Nap? What&apos;s that?!! :-)



A lot of the bridesmaids arrived as we all got ready and then piled into the cars to head to the church ready for the photos before the ceremony.



Steph and I had also been named as &apos;Honoured Guests&apos; in the program so that was super sweet!



It was also the first time I had been so involved in all the details of a wedding and wow! They are certainly a full on affair!! Whoa!



We were a liiiiiiiiiiitle late getting there, but the photos all managed to get done and all was ready for the ceremony without a hitch!



There were a lot of people in the wedding party (hmmm 9 bridesmaids and 9 groomsmen if I remember correctly!) and several little children as well, but all went off perfectly, some of the girls being a little tired and ended up carried down the aisle, but so lovely!



When Taysha and Grant walked up to the altar, we all kind of held our breath as the Matron of honour slowly slid out and we could hear her shoes running down the hallway. Turned out she had forgotten the rings!!! But luckily grabbed them and arrived back at her place just in time with no one any the wiser!



The ceremony was lovely and Taysha and Grant were so happy, it was so nice!



Steph and i had been allocated &apos;dates&apos;, one being Tay&apos;s brother Taylor who was so good to us, driving us between the various venues, always looking out for us to make sure we were being looked after, and then making sure we got home. It was so lovely and we always felt so welcomed and included!



The reception looked stunning with all the fairy lights and candles and flowers and decorations we had done earlier that morning.



We chatted and mingled as we then filed through the delicious dinner buffet, had all the lovely traditional speeches, cake and dances and then everyone of all ages got up to dance the night away together which was awesome.



As Tay and Grant left we all made a path for them to pass through with sparklers which looked amazing!



Thankfully ripping down all the decorations certainly took a lot less time than it had to put up that morning though that is for sure!!



The next morning Taylor picked us up to head back to Grant&apos;s parents - an absolutely Beautiful old house where we all ate again! Wedding leftovers, and lots of fresh breakfast dishes we snacked on all morning as the presents were opened.



Most people had headed back for another after party after the reception the night before and were looking like walking dead today before crashing out on various couches and chairs!



A quick trip to the mall, a delicious Mexican dinner at La Hacienda and we were all super ready to crash again before our early start the next morning!



And there it was! The nasty wake up ar 3.30am as we hit the road by 4am for the several hours back to Houston for all our flights. We had organised it well so Tay and Grant were flying out for their honeymoon and Steph and I were also flying out from the same airport within a couple of hours of each other and could all ride share!



We stopped in at Buckee&apos;s, a crazy true Texan store filled to the brim with all kinds of state memorabilia which was really nice to see everyone is so proud!!! I didn&apos;t realise, but Texas was actually run by Mexico and then an independant state for ten years before they joined the United States!



And then it was time for our farewells!! Ah! A fantastic time to celebrate with Tay and Grant and catch up with Steph! Everyone was so friendly and so welcoming it was such a lovely time! Farewell Texas! Farewell Mexican food! I am looking for a break from you! :-)



I caught the little train over to my terminal and found a seat to wile away the next few hours!



My worst nightmare was revealed as I arrived at my seat to find a lady with no English nursing a baby on her lap and a giant bag across the entire floor of my seat as it wouldn&apos;t fit in the overhead lockers.... I couldn&apos;t even sit down! Luckily I found a flight attendant who was super nice and moved me to an empty seat... Thank goodness! Crisis averted! :-)
 
Life in an Ashram, Val Morin, Quebec, Canada. Finally finished!!!!!!!!!!! :-)

2011-11-13 to 2011-11-14

I had about 40 mins from my arrival in Montreal to be off the plane, through customs, immigration, pick up my backpack and be at the Pickup point for the Ashram shuttle to come and pick me up. Hmm! Luckily all went according to plan and with some serious speed walking through the many many lengths of paths to get out of arrivals, I made it!



And of course the shuttle was waaaaay late! But all was well in the end as we began the journey of just over an hour towards the Laurentian Mountains and Val Morin where I was to spend the next month living in an Ashram.



It was a bit of a crazy arrival, it was pitch black as we came through the gates and walked up the stairs to a mass of people everywhere! As the shuttle was running late, there was no time! I was given my room allocation and asked to return quickly for dinner.



I was living downstairs in the lodge, the main building that is also built into the mountain, with a natural rock wall running along the corridor in front of our rooms.



I had opted for the dorm accomdation (much cheaper! And friendlier I figured! :-) ) and was allocated to room 13.



We had a bathroom attached which we shared with another room of four girls in the other side. There was a sink in each room, but apart from that one toilet, shower, bath and basin between 8 people all on the one schedule! Oh oh! But surprisingly enough it worked totally fine!!



I was in a room with two Quebecwa girls, Stephanie and Valerie, and an English lady who lives in France, Alison.  As it turned out I was very lucky, with all three being fantastic people and room mates... And no one snored! :-)



It had been a very very long day and it was already overwhelming to arrive in the midst of everyone everywhere who already seemed to know each other, and trying to figure out what was going on.



I headed into the dining room, got my tray, stainless bowl, high sided plate, cup, spoon and fork and held them out for the food to be served up to me.



Dinner was an Indian feast - lentils, several different kinds of vegetables, potatoes, rice, and then the world&apos;s  largest salad, piled high in a bowl at least 80cm wide! Well, actually pretty much lettuce with a few little bits of tomato, but I&apos;ll still say salad! :-)



There was home made salad dressing (which changed every day) and a Delicious fresh herbal tea which also changed every meal, fennel, lemon, orange, Ginger, chamomile, apple, cinnamon, every variation of random fresh items in the bottom of the pot, but all hot, tasty and delicious!



Everyone (probably fifty people ) were just Sitting randomly somewhere on the floor, and so I found a spare space, carefully balanced my tray and sat down on the cold hard floor to eat. A Little overwhelmed that&apos;s for sure! It was a Long long long day though!



I got back to the room and as I was last to arrive I had a top bunk for the stay; and the girls cleared shelves so we each had a shelf and a half each for our belongings. I made my bed and it was literally time to go again for   Evening Satsung. As i found out, Satsung means Company with the wise, and I dressed warmly to head outside the hundred or so metres to the Krishna Temple.



Shoes and jackets off in the entranceway foyer, we climbed the stairs and entered. A Mat, chant book and cushion were set up for everyone facing a little stage where two ladies wrapped in orange &apos;monk&apos; attire were sitting - the two Swami&apos;s that ran the course for us, and one in charge of the Ashram.



Here we had meditation - silent concentration focussing the mind for about 30 mins, but I could barely even sit still on the hard ground for five minutes. My head felt like it had a giant weight pressing down on it, my mind kept wandering and it was so uncomfortable!



We were then brought out of the meditation by three Om&apos;s we all joined in with and we were told to turn to page 11 of the book as the Chanting started.... Jaya Ganesha, a chant over ten minutes long that I would soon find out we would chant twice a day every day, one in the morning and once in the evening! There were hand held drums, tamborines and the little symbols as the chant increased pace, the music increased and the temple was filled with an amazing energy.



The Swami played a harmonium, which is a little chest that has air like an accordian, and keyboard like a piano. Played along with the chant it sounds awesome!



The chants were made up of what appeared to be Random, random sanscript words ( but all meant something!) that you had absolutely no idea how to even possibly go about pronouncing them! To give you an idea...

Gajananan butaganadi sevitam

Kapittha Jambu phala sara bhakshakan

Uma sutam shokavinasha karanam

Namami vighneshvara pada pamkajam.



Most of them were call and and repeat type format, but some we also just chanted all together from the kirtan book.





We then had our &apos;initiation&apos;! I had no idea what to expect from this, but it was all clearly explained and demonstrated as one by one our names were called, we prostrated (kneeling down and then touching our head and arms to the floor) to the statues of the masters and deities, to the large figure of Krishna, and then to the Swami as we knelt down in front of her. Our faces were then drawn on with three powders:

Ash - signifying the purification or transformation of the material into spiritual when placed in the fire of wisdom. Placed in three lines across the forehead, it symbolises the three gunas (qualities of nature, that we to learn about later on course) which are transformed into the unified spirit.

Sandalwood paste - applied to the Ajna Chakra or &apos;Third Eye&apos; to open the eye of intuition so knowledge may enter.

Kumkum - symbolic of the Divone Mother, the Shakti (power) of God in the Universe.



We then received our yellow shoulder  bags we were to carry around for the remainder of the course, full with our uniforms and manual. Our uniforms were White pants representing purity, and yellow Sivananda teacher training course t shirts representing wisdom or learning.



We had the final prayers - Om Tryambakam and the universal prayer- and then Arati, where we all stood as one of the staff lit a little candle carrier and waved the light around the deities and masters as we chanted. It is the light of knowledge and designed to take the qualities of these people and then bring it towards us and burn our ego as we symbolically accept the light of the flame towards us at the end before prostrating. Of course I had no idea what was going on though!!



On our way out we all took a peice of the prassad, or offerings that had been blessed throughout the ceremony to consume. The plate was nicely arranged with little pieces of fresh and dried fruits and nuts.



Our teachers were Swami Rajeshwarananda, originally from Mexico, who lived in an Ashram in Rome, Italy; and Swami Ambikananda, originally from England who now runs the Ashram we were at!



To be a Swami you take vows very similar to that of a monk, so in all respects that is what they are!



Yoga also means union or united, so the union of the mind, body and spirit which was interesting to know.



I had crazy crazy dreams and almost Nightmares that first night and the girls in my room all said I was sleep talking really agitatedly like there were bad things going on! They had this little chunk of wood that you lit, then making it smoke for a bit which banished the &apos;evilness&apos; as they opened the doors and windows to send them away. It worked as they never bothered me again!



We are supposed to maintain silence from evening satsung until after satsung the following morning, and so

the pitch black of 0530am awoke us with the tolling of the bell, which is our wake up call every morning, and then again at 5.50 to tell us to leave for the Satsung.... And then ten minutes before every class we are supposed to be at all day!



The Krishna temple is where we had left the night before after the meditation and chanting, known as Satsung.... And where we returned to the next morning! As my roomie Alison put it, sometimes it felt like we should just sleep there! It was so named after a large statue of the deity Krishna housed in the middle, and pictures and statues of all other deities and gods of all religions, as well as the masters of the Sivananda Yoga - Swami Sivananda and Swami Vidhnu Devananda.



As the first morning of the course, we had a Ceremony conducted by the Indian Temple Priest (who was that day returning to India for the winter) to remove Obstacles to Ganesha, the Elephant headed God.



The priest drew an amazing pattern on the floor with coloured substances of sand like consistency, and then went through various prayers before we all individually went up and received rose petals to throw down onto the pattern and it literally felt like troubles, obstacles, (something!) were being thrown away too as I walked away feeling lighter and smiling uncontrollably. Weird, but true!



As we all sat and chanted, the priest came around and individually drew on all our foreheads with one of the substances.



There were almost 40 people on our course, mainly girls, with just four guys, and ranging in age from 19- 67!!! How awesome is that!! And from all around the world, and speaking a multitude of languages! It was amazing! Some of us had no common language at all, but we all managed to communicate somehow! :-) all the classes were either done in English with a simultaneous French translation with headsets and an ashram staff translator, or were bilingual, such as the yoga classes, partly French and partly English.



We also were given our roll call number - I was number 17.... And that was my new identity for the rest of the course!!



It was also so nice to be able to see the place in light after having wandered around in the dark since my arrival!



We were totally Surrounded by mountains and nature, and no distractions. And it was lovely! So quiet, so peaceful and so fresh and clean!! - The Ashram opened in 1962 and is situated on over 265 acres of woodland in the Laurentian Mountains.





We also had an abundance of Cats and two goats wandering around, trying to get into accomodation, the temple, anywhere we were! They also jumped up on the window ledges and stood there watching us in the dining room! It was awesome!



We quickly changed and headed to our first Yoga class!  Two hours..... And I was way Out of my depth... It is a Totally different style that I am used to, but I vey much enjoy this style and teachings, just a steep learning curve!!



Funny to think by how the end I was doing it in my sleep!!



And then... Finally!!!!! It was Brunch!!!!! We were starving!!!!! And  So much food - we lined up to be served, and this time there was even more food - some hot dishes like dinner - rice, a lentil soup, some veg and sauce, lettuce salad with dressing, and then also with freshly baked wholewheat bread (made in the kitchen!), natural peanut butter, home made berry jam, honey, soy and regular milk, and porridge or muesli. So good!!



Once again we all sat with our trays on the floor to eat. Strange how it would soon become so normal!



We then had a lesson on Karma yoga, or selfless service where we were all allocated chores to help keep the ashram running. I got dishes at night which I was none too pleased about!



We then had a chanting lecture to help us Figure out how on earth &apos;yo say these words, and then the Philosophy lecture on Swami Sivananda, the guru of this style of yoga.



We were all in  Sooooo much pain sitting on the hard wooden floor for two hours! So hard to move when we got up!! I wondered how on earth I was going to survive a month of this!!



And Homework! If there was not enough jammed into each day we also had to write a &apos;resume&apos;, or summary of the main lecture each day to hand in and be assessed. It was full on!



And another quick change of clothes and it was time for Yoga again! Yup, really getting quite hungry by now!!!



This was Awesome teaching, going through all the postures.... And then..... Dinner!!!! Finally!!!



And then Dishes. Ugh! Wow there are a lot of dishes!!! There was a procession line of three washers; one rinser who then stacked the dishwasher trays, pushed the two trays into the industrial dishwasher and Then I grabbed them out the other side when they were done to dry, stack and put away and return the trays to keep the cycle moving!!



And then the Race to Satsung!!



One of the other side effects of being in the kitchen is the smell of food that totally engulfs you, but there was no time!!  Feeling all rushed and dirty and bleh, we raced to throw our uniforms on and arrive at satsung in time!



Today it literally felt like a weight had been lifted off my head as I sat through the 35 mins literally without moving or opening my eyes. Wow! That didn&apos;t take long to adjust!!



The chanting then started and you couln&apos;t help but chant along and move and clap with the rhythm, and feel great!



Shower.... Bed! Wiped out! But feeling amazing and so much positive energy! Phew!! What a day though!





In line with recently discussing that people are able to harness their energy to exist on air and water alone, i slowly noticed that one of our Swami&apos;s didn&apos;t eat brunch and had just one small bowl of lettuce for dinner! And that&apos;s it! And she is fighting fit. I am starting to think there may be some truth to that after all!



So I am a little bit hungry, and would kill for a chair to sit on for just five minutes, bit apart from that I feel a million dollars!!!
 
The days continue, Sivananda. Ashram, Val Moron, Quebec, Canada

2011-11-15 to 2011-11-18

It already feels like i have been here a lifetime, not just a few days! The outside world seems forever away.



Although each day follows the same schedule, each day is still different.



The black bags under my eyes that have plagued me since December are vanishing daily and the weinkles are reversing! :-)



Day two....



Already I feel I have accomplished. Although only learning the Sivananda yoga since I arrived, today I have mastered the Kapalabhati Abdomen Breathing without becomming light headed and stopping, and also the Anuloma Viloma Breathing through the nose without having to open my mouth and get air. Although they may be just small obstacles, it really made a super positive difference to my day.



Next I told myself I would master the headstand, this I learnt also just yesterday, a million miles away. And today I also did it!! Sure it was not the prettiest in the world, and the descent was certainly not glamorous, but I got there... Twice! :-)



We held our postures for much longer today, it was a struggle as I was already feeling a little bit tight and sore from the hours completed yesterday. It felt so good at the end though!



We began learning how to meditate properly, how to structure a class to teach; and about Swami Vishnu - Devananda who founded the Ashram back in 1962 and established the True World Order to promote peace and understanding. He was quite amazing, and had a very interesting life, opening Ashrams, writing books and travelling the world teaching yoga and its principles (the five points - proper exercise, proper breathing, proper relaxtion, proper diet, positive thinking and meditation) and promoting peace, especially in trouble spots around the world, flying his brightly coloured peace plane through Berlin, Ireland and the Middle East on a &apos;Citizen of the World&apos; passport he made himself.



Today also began our study of the Bhagatva Gita, a section of the epic Mahabharata, the story of Life. The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most important scriptures in Yoga and teaches the means to live a spiritual life whilst in the midst of daily stress, conflicts and problems through it&apos;s scene on a battlefield. It is kind of heavy to read in it&apos;s old style narrative but its lessons are definatrly interesting.



And then during evening Satsang we watched a video on Swami Sivananda. Busy, busy, busy! :-)



We were also learning how to make our lives easier- the first day we took just one cushion as we entered the Krishna temple, suffering in silence after a day of sitting on hard wooden floors. Today we took many, squashing them under our butts, knees, ankles, anywhere in pain! Ahhhh! :-)



Today was the first day with free time too, which was most welcome!! I checked out the little library upstairs where we could relax, and took a walk around the grounds, checking out the various statues, ponds, water features, and then up hundreds and hundreds of really really slippery wooden stairs to the temple!



I passed a peace monument along the way, and then arrived into the grounds of the Subramanya - Ayyapa Temple, overlooking the grounds of the Ashram, and lots of different little shrines around it. Unfortunately it was all closed for the winter, but interesting to see anyway.



Karma Yoga dishes after dinner still took forever, forcing us to literally run and change into our meditation outfits and run to the Krishna temple to make it on time for evening Satsung. The door is locked at start time to ensure the meditation is not interrupted so you must be in by then and must not be late!



I was also starting to get used to the two meals a day, eating a massive, massive brunch to try and ward off the starvation I had later in the day yesterday.



So apart from the starvation and feeling desperately that I would love a chair to sit in for just five minutes, all was extremely well! :-)



Already we all have more energy, are feeling happier, and are more positive. I can&apos;t wait to see us at the end!



Day three...



It was quite funny, the course had been tallking about how so many people had been waking up at 3/3.30am and wondered if it had some spiritual significance... Turned out after the Swami laughed, it just means anxiety! I had escaped, until this morning! Damn it for getting the idea on my head!! No more though! :-)



We had an amazing start, but it turned out to be a long tiring day. We began with a silent meditation walk out in the chilly dark pre dawn to arrive through woods on the edge of beautiful Lac Raymond (Lake), which was a nice surprise!



There were then more lessons on teaching, The bhagavad Gita, and then interestingly on psychology of our mind. We learnt how people often give up or face difficulties or dissappointment due to pre conceived ideas they have, and ways in which to overcome them such as maintaining an open mind, realising every situation is an opportunity to learn from, balancing your life and duties, and most importantly realising that they are not real, and just thoughts generated by the mind.



In break I headed to the Peace Plane museum which holds the plane that Swami Vishnudevananda used in his peace missions around the world; and Master&apos;s Pond, a large lond with a shrine and statue, literally about 200m from our accomodation.



I then crashed big time, struggling to stay awake at the beginning of our yoga class and then light headed and no energy! At all!



I did manage to get into &apos;the locust&apos; today so that was an achievement, especially considering my lack of energy! And for the first time also managed to hold my breath the entire minute (without sneaking quick air refills!) like we were supposed to during our breathing exercises!



It&apos;s not all easy though!! I still really struggle on the abdominal breathing (a consequence of breathing wrongly through my chest for the past 30 years!! :-) ), and breathing through my mose. I have never ever done that as i could never get enough air, but now i am trying to retrain myself! And also anything that involves flexibility in the hamstrings and calves and having to straighten my knees....! Like leg raises! Ugh! :-)



I was definately struggling today and i began to wonder... The food is great but I am really not sure I am getting enough protein eating just fruit and veg and one lentil or bean based component a day....??? My room mate Allison assures me we are, it&apos;s just getting used to it as I am not vegetarian!



It is also so weird to not eat until 10, and then be so hungry that we eat enough for both breakfast and lunch and morning tea combined to try and curb the hunger and then more to have enough energy to make it through the day! Being mostly plants I find I burn it fast though and am starving and energyless by the afternoon. I went back for thirds for dinner tonight! Dinner is small though! :-)



And it was time again for karma yoga. It was weird, I was so annoyed about having to do dishes (after several years washing them in Europe means i am well over it! :-) ) for Karma Yoga and even more doubly annoyed I had the evening shift when I am usually really tired. But tonight I realised that it was actually a blessing in disguise, which I guess then it achieved its purpose. :-) As it turned out, I ended up on drying duty - which I do not mind, I ended up with some cool chicks that I got to know that I wouldn&apos;t have otherwise, the dinner timing was actually better as there were less dishes, and it also meant you were free and could therefore finish your homework after lunch before it was due! So I guess literally everything is here to teach us a lesson!



We also got additional people (also councidently pulled off bread baking - the job I wanted!!) to assist us in the kitchen so we could finish in time to get changed and to Satsung without having to run, which was a nice change!!



It felt like it had been a long day and during evening Satsung I just could not stop my mind wandering, nor could i stop fidgeting and my butt and back were soooo sore from just sitting on the bean bag cushion on the hard, cold wooden floor. I don&apos;t know how people do it all their lives!!   For the first time I was glad for it to come to a close so we could get onto the super fun chants!! Definitely one of my favourite parts of the day as it always makes you feel so energised, happy and amazing!



We also had talks by two devotees (?) I am not sure the word for them, people who are devoting their lives to yoga and the Ashram; who had been either taught by Swami Vishu - Devananda or travelled with him on some of his pilgramages around the world which was really entertaining.



It sounds odd I know, but everyone says he is still here in the grounds, and the energy in the temple was electric after we finished several rounds of his chant &apos;Om Namo Naranya&apos;, his chant for world peace.



And then bed! Yay! Do love the early nights, even if it does mean the bell tolls at 5.30am to get us up. It feels very healthy though, I quite like it! :-)



Day four...



I found a themometer outside one of the buildings today and checked it as I walked past each time. It appeared to be a high of 1&apos;C today!! Brr! And then it started snowing! Light fluffy flakes as we walked to class and then a torrent of them coming down as we watched out the windows. By the time we left yoga class that evening, the ground was covered a good inch deep!! So nice!!!



It was a tough tiring energyless day for everyone today as we struggled through our teaching lessons, Bhagavad Gita, yoga class, another day of Karma Yoga, and trying to wrap our brains around the theories of the yoga philosophy about Brahman being &apos;the absolute&apos;, how it manifests in materiel form in Maya, or Ishwara, the highest concept a human mind can hold, I.e. &apos;God&apos;. Minds spinning, we moved on to Atman, the absolute Consciousness in an individual; and the three gunas, or qualities of energy - knowledge, activity and laziness (Sattca, Rajas and Tamas). Okay, that is really hard to sum up in a sentence after it took us two hours to wrap our heads around it! :-)



I have also mastered the headstand for sure! No more nasty falling! :-)



Satsung this evening was a Silent Meditation Walk in the lovely snow until we arrived at the back of the temple area where a massive bonfire was waiting for us! We chanted our daily chants and looked up at the brightest most amazing stars stretching as far as the eye can see, just like astrology charts! Beautiful! We all stood around the giant bonfire shooting sparks dozens of metres into the air as some of the girls played drums and we sung and chanted. It was an awesome relaxing end to the week as we chatted happily on the way home to arrive back in the dining hall for hot chocolates and curried popcorn. Clearly I didn&apos;t have the drink!, but the popcorn was surprisingly delicious!





It was a really long, tiring and tough day today, and I caved on many parts after the ill effects suffering through yesterday! I started by eating a snack after morning Satsung and before yoga... a good solution as I then was actually able to concentrate for the first time in the morning since being here!! And even better and was not ready to kill for food by brunch!! And then didn&apos;t have to eat enough to feed a small nation when I arrived! Definatrly the best way forward!



I gave it my best shot, living the Ashram way all week, and as much as I do not love going 16 hours without food, especially with seven of them doing activities, i tried! But I still need to get something out of the course, and a lot of people have been finding it really tough, leading to the kitchen staff leaving fruit out for us all! Yay!  :-)



I hurt my knee at lacrosse several months ago and to cut a long story short, it is not covered on any insurances I have and so cannot get it fixed (MRI, operation - suspected torn meniscus and ACL), and am unable to sit cross legged. Clearly what we do 95% of our days here!! I was starting to get pain again and then pain in my back from sitting crookedly trying to support it and so found a chair for the three hours of lectures in the middle if the day we are usually on the hard wooden floor for. Definatrly made another big difference! I hope I am preserving it to let me finish the course! :-)





Day five...



Finally! Well, I know I have only been here for less than a week but it already feels like a lifetime... Which means I am in desperate need of a day off! Well, as much as a day off you can get when you still have to get up to the tolling of the bell at 0530 h and into uniform for Satsung, and then still do your karma yoga duties, homework and evening Satsung anyway!



But a nice chance to get into the sauna, relax, do laundry and chill out... Also to give the brain and muscles a well earned rest after our full on days since we arrived a thousand years ago! :-)



There is not much around us, but I took a walk outside and found so many lovely friendly people, stopping to offer me lifts, say hello or ask how I was going! So lovely! Everything is totally French here though, French signs, French newspapers, magazines, and language! Luckily as usual a smile I&apos;d universal! :-)



Lisa and I were also making fresh bread - the people allocated it it had been moved to other karma yoga duties - and so we were helping out the cook, Ben... Only he wasn&apos;t there! Another Ashram staff, Shiva, directed us to a cookbook and so we stumbled aimlessly finding ingredients and putting it all together. We had never made bread before!! Ben walked in just as we were dishing out our 10th cup of flour and shook his head, &apos;oh that recipe is too complicated!!&apos; he said, I know a quick one! Oh well! Too late now!! :-) we kneaded and kneaded and left it to rise.... Fingers crossed! Over an hour and a half preparation!! Whoa! We were then told it will only turn out if we are happy and make it with love! Apparently it is a true story! If you are angry or sad the bread will take on your negative qualities!



We bake it tonight.... Stay tuned! :-)


 
Boots on, off, jacket on, off, uniform on, off! Sleep?!!&amp;drinking saltwater, Val Morin, QC, Canada

2011-11-19 to 2011-11-25

Unfortunately I can&apos;t write a P.S. On my last entry but our bread never rose! It tasted quite nice though - quite like a African Rusk, or brioche perhaps, and Luckily our super supportive classmates ate it all up anyway!! :-)



It&apos;s amazing how quickly you just slide into the daily schedule, and how nice it is not to have any distractions or worries from every day life!!



I am starting to become a little sick of lentils though! I am shuddering as I write the word! It doesn&apos;t help that it was the last thing I ate before I got sick in Africa as well though! :-)



We have had some awesome surprises though, rice noodles with a delicious green tofu curry and wholewheat banana pancakes one day!! It might not sound a lot, but it is definitely the little things that make a difference!!



The days begin to blur as more and more lessons and masses of homework take away all our free time!



I was starting to reach the point of super tired and run down (unfortunately it doesn&apos;t take long any more!!) and was about to tell the Swami I couldn&apos;t make it to Satsung in the evening - as I had to catch up on my homework and sleep - when she announced a study night and early lights out. Thank goodness! I survive on course for another day!! :-)



Our days stretched from the regular 15 hours to up to 17. Definately not the relaxation I had hoped for!!



It was crazy! Getting up at 5.30, starting at 6 and back to back classes until sometimes almost 10. And then on the worst days, homework to follow!! Luckily we usually managed to sneak it in here and there between classes or the study period.



It was almost like being back in military training, long days, someone else&apos;s schedule, masses of information, uniform changes every few hours and rushing quick showers whenever we could. Wash hair?? What&apos;s that?!! :-)



One day we had a break and I looked forward to a nice long shower... But alas, the drains are blocked so all you have is 8 minutes before the water wil start to overflow from the shower area. Doh! :-)



One thing at least we didn&apos;t have on our minds is wondering what there would be for meals! Lettuce, brocolli, lentils, rice, check! :-)



We did a lot of readings at morning Satsung from Swami Sivananda&apos;s letters. We heard how he always said open it to a page and the answer you needed would be there. And time after time it was opened to a page talking about things we had just been discussing! It happened on so many occasions it was crazy!!



We had silent morning meditation walks where the rain stops just long enough for us to get out, hikes through the forrested mountains, or through the pouring(??! Not sure the correct term for that!!) snow! The lake has already changed remarkably since we arrived, it is now pretty much frozen and covered in snow!



I also managed to fall asleep sitting up in morning meditation... Yup, the true definition of tired! Luckily I awoke on the fall downwards and didn&apos;t hit the ground!



Along with pur regular classes we also had a Drumming workshop where someone came in to teach us to use the hand drums and chat mantras at the same time which was good fun, and sounded awesome!



And the lessons continued...! Lessons on types of students and teachers.



Most interesting on karma and reincarnation and its effect on our lives everyday.



So according to philosophy, our bodies are just physical carriers for our eternal souls. As a result, there is no such thing as blind chance or accident, as the things that happen are a result of karma from your previous lives.



So there are three types of yoga:

Sanchita - accumulated yoga of the past that you are waiting for the reaction for;

Prarabdha - karma responsible for present. You can&apos;t change it, but you can change your attitude towards it.

Agami - karma being done now for the reaction in the future.



It still says destiny is in your hands, as the karma ( thoughts and actions) you are doing now will determine your future.



Very interesting! Also I found so about the reincarnation and déjà vu is probably real, and when you meet someone, but feel like you have known them forever... You probably have!!



Then On the steps to enlightenment and the path to detach yourself from negative thoughts, actions, words, detachment from all material things that lead to attachment and suffering, and the effects of karma.



Types of yoga-

Karma yoga - the yoga of action and selfless service

Bkhakti Yoga- the yoga of devotion

Raja Yoga - the yoga of mind control, the scientific approach, and

Jnana Yoga - the yoga of knowledge, the philosophical approach.



And more and more on chanting, the correct promounciation of the sanscript words and the meanings of what we were saying.



After having a light dinner and then fasting for 15 hours, We had a morning of Kryias.... Cleansing exercises. We started by doing abdominal cleansing by exhaling, sucking all the air out and then pumping our abdomens.



We were then all given a bucket, neti pot, a long cord of rubber and lukewarm salty water.



We then had to put the neti pot full of salty water in one nostril as it came out the other into our buckets. Then reverse. If you tilt your head too far it goes into your ear channels as I found out the hard way! Not nice! And it makes your eyes water non stop involuntarily!



I think we went through a dozen boxes of tissues this exercise though as mucas and salty water streamed out of our noses. It definately cleaned that out!



We then had to put the rubber cord up one nostril and push it until it came down the back of our throat and pull it entirely through our mouth, and then the other side. Just like flossing we were told! Gross!



And this is not easy! It feels weird, and hurts quite a bit and once you reach a certain point it makes you sneeze non stop. If you can get past that point it is kind of blocked unless you can somehow figure out how to make it turn and go the right way through the pain and sneezing!! Nasty!!



It also gave you non stop tears and a Running running nose!! And a painful sensation right up in your sinuses!



Most of the class could not get it though so I guess it is practice... If you like that kind of thing!! Me... I&apos;ll be okay without it!!



We then were given a cup of lukewarm salty water with a long piece of gauze in it. We had to slowly drink the water and swallow the gauze, putting it to one side of our throat so we didn&apos;t constantly gag, and make sure it went down and didn&apos;t bunch up. None of us were particularly good at this either... Massive gag reflex on both the salty water and swallowing gauze bit by bit until you reached the end!



The process would take ten or so minutes and then you were supposed to pull it back up to cleanse the throat. O think I&apos;ll be okay without ever doing that one too! :-)



And finally.... Drinking salt water til we vomited. Well, it has a technical name and and purpose for cleansing, but we each had a cup and had to scull quickly the warm salty water, (8-10 glasses, so over 2 litres all up!) until your stomach hurt and you could not drink anymore, and then you leant over your bucket and threw up, or put your fingers down your throat time and time again until it was all out!! Not so fun!! In fact this burst dozens of capillaries on and around my eyes so there were all red and covered in little red dots which was not fun! And somehow my entire sinus passages managed to get blocked up as well, so yup, i reiterate, not so much fun!!



Looking around, it was like we were back in the 1900&apos;s and a bout of cholera or something was going through as every which way you turned there were dozens of people bent over vomiting! Rather random class bonding experience!! :-)



A lot of people couldn&apos;t throw it all up, so there was a lot of running to the bathroom for them during the day as they were cleansed from the inside! :-)



I am definately glad I got to try them all though and know people have been doing them for centuries, but not sure how many I will take back to daily life!! :-)



We were all quite tired and drained afterwards and a lot of people had quite emotional reactions to it, which is apparently normal, especially if you do them all together like we had just done!!



It did take me a good day to get over the blocked sinuses and stuffy face though. Nasty!



Now we had been here Crazy yoga class on postures and variations from the usual which have been awesome fun and really stretched us.



I am not exaggerating when I saw we would have done three trillion sun salutations also! Kind of never want to see them again and it is only week two! We are also managing about a thousand breathing exercises and minute long retentions between.



So many people are getting run down and sick too.... Keep it away from me!!



And the weekends... Mean Weekend guests to have a yoga retreat at the Ashram.... Which Means hundreds more dishes!! Ugh! We are definately getting good at it now though!:-)



A yogi violinist alsocame to play for us at evening Satsung... He was amazing!



We watched a DVD - In the name of peace - on Swami Vishnudevananda and his missions that he took his peace plane on to the world&apos;s trouble spots back in the 60&apos;s/ 70&apos;s which was awesome.



It has been tough, but really interesting. My room mate Stephanie helped put it in perspective too, we were all talking about how hard it was and how tired we are and she was saying how she was talking to someone else and they reminded her how long she had been planning to come here, how much she had been looking forward to it and it was the one opportunity she had to be in this position and it wasn&apos;t going to change so she may as well enjoy it! It kind of gave me a paradigm shift too and that night we had a lesson off so had extra sleep, another class had a different teacher and all these little things happened.... Or maybe I was just open to them again :-)



And it is Sooooooooo cold!!! And I thought the snow was just sooo pretty when it arrived... But I must saw it is starting to wear thin! Having to put on snow boots to go anywhere, try not to slide on the icy parts, stomp off the snow to enter buildings, vainly attempt not to get your socks wet, rug up in a thousand layers, beanie and neckwarmers to just walk 50 metres! And then you have to leave everything in the coatroom as it is either wet or covered in snow! Things I have never had to deal with before! It still looks so pretty though! :-)



And the Christmas lights are out too!! The ashram looks so preety at night!!!



And half way!!! In desperate need of a day off again today, but I think it will fly from here!

Week Three....



Our day off... Well as usual after compulsary satsung (meditation and chanting), meals, karma yoga duties and homework.... our few hours off! I headed into &apos;town&apos; with my room mates. It was about a 15 minute drive to Val David and it was a super cute little one street town where we visited a delicious bulk organic shop full of dehydrated fruit, a few little random stores filled with everything and then to La Vagabond Boulgarie which is well known for its pastries and croissants. I could not face any of them after our very basic diet for the past few weeks,  but the people who ate them loved them! It was amazing to be out, in regular clothes for a few hours, but also so weird being &apos;outside&apos;! I was definately ready to go back &apos;inside&apos;! :-) All the signs, menu&apos;s etc were in French, everyone spoke French, and I kept thinking I was in another country, not Canada! So weird!



I think I was finally in the routine too as I actually enjoyed the 20 minutes of breathing exercises and then the dozens of sun salutation movement exercises for the first time after having a day and a half without yoga!!



We also had several treats this week with a muesli slice and Banana bread that kept us going.... Thank goodness!!! It&apos;s the small things!!! :-) Although the food is good, it does get very tiresome and repetitive having lentils and lettuce and rice every single meal. I think the muesli and porridge was just a first week treat too as we haven&apos;t seen it since, darn it!!! We really do try though, we have had Thai, Chinese and Italian nights along with the regular Indian.



There are no foods that are stimulants or block the mind or cause difficulties meditating, so no caffeine, chillies, onions, garlic. Nothing that is from violence so no meat or meat products, and nothing that is not considered pure, so no refined or processed foods; and nothing like vinegar or mushrooms that preserve / rot. So not a lot to work with! :-)



I was starting to get the calcium deficient ridges across my nails though, so have been stocking up on drinks of milk whenever I can.... Hmmm Iron.... Not so easily fixed!!! :-)



Our schedule continued.... Classes on various yogic philosophies such as the three bodies, the vehicles of the soul towards it&apos;s journey to perfection, the main pranas, or vital energy; and the one I found most interesting - learning about the chakras - the centres of vital energy in our body located from the crown of the head, between the eyebrows, the throat, heart, navel, genitals and end of spinal column.



Sivananda yoga, which I am studying, corresponds to these with the twelve basic postures we do each class energising each in turn, starting at the head with the headstand and working down the body.



We have had some totally Awesome asana (steady postures) classes, where we have learnt dozens of variations on postures that have had us contorting our bodies and attempiting to balance which has been an awesome learning experience.



We also began anatomy and physiology which was nice to be able to relate what we had been learning in our yoga classes to the actual mechanics of the body.



Our Bhagavad Gita (ancient scripture of yoga) and chanting classes have continued as we have struggled to keep our eyes open with them falling straight after our meal!



This week The Bhagavad Gita taught us that the last thought in your mind at the time of death determines your next life, so in preparation we walked around saying &apos;Om&apos; &apos;Om!&apos; &apos;Om&apos; every time we were sarcastic or complained about feeling tired or how much work we had just in case we tripped and fell! :-)



We had also been split into groups and began teaching!! We just found out the day before what lesson and who was teaching just to add to it! I was allocated beginners class number four and had five students (fellow trainees) instead of the usual three. It was tough figuring out how to call and time the breathing, the sun salutations (sequence of 12 flowing movements with concurrent breathing patterns) and then fit in the demonstrations of the new positions as well as the rest of the 12 postures we do each class!! Amongst several other poses, I had to teach the headstand.... which was quite challenging trying to individually help five &apos;beginners&apos; in the time! The lesson is really long but i somehow managed to finish exactly on time an hour and a half later which I was so stoked about, especially when I looked around to the other lessons and realised they were still just going into the final relaxation! I did learn that teaching nose breathing and retention exercises is challenging when demonstrating and talking at the same time though and should not be attempted unless you want to sound like you are talking over a radio!



It was really good fun and a really good learning experience!



This week out of nowhere I also randomly managed to get my head to my knees on the forward bend, so another thing ticked off the list! :-)



Evening satsung was replaced one night by an evening of non stop chanting which was good fun, as, as soon as one chant ended someone jumped in with another and it was a continuous cycle with no talking which was a very nice change! Also all the instruments were all out in force being passed around and played by everyone which created an awesome upbeat energy.



Another evening, two kathak Dancers ( one male and female) from northern India came to preform for us in the Krishna temple. They were amazing, telling traditional stories with their facial expressions and movements and really talented! It was a super nice change!



Another evening we had a talent show... And it turned out we had quite the group! A stand up comedian, some dancers, a hula hoopist (? :-) ) beatboxers, singers, guitar and mandolin players!! Brilliant!



Another mid week evening this week when we all just wanted to collapse and the last thing we felt like doing was sitting through an evening Satsung... we were told there was a special activity. It was pouring rain, so instead of walking we got into the Ashram cars and arrived at the Theatre du marais!!! It was sooo cute!!! A tiny little movie theatre that time had forgotten with Soft comfy red reclining chairs. Yep.... Chairs!!! There was all sorts of signed Memorabilia around Walls from its heyday and it was awesome!



We sat down (!!!! So nice!!!!) and were given little bowls of curry popcorn and

Pink lemonade ( well it was pink and had lemon pith in it... It wasn&apos;t fizzy and there probably wasn&apos;t any sugar so I don&apos;t know what to call it, but it was nice!!)



And the movie came on!!! So apparantly Kung Fu Panda has many valuable lessons for yogis!!!:

- there is no secret ingredient, it is yourself!

- yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift which is why it is called the present!

- believe!

- train a person how they need to be trained... everyone is different!



Lessons or not noted, it was so nice to get out and totally boosted our spirits right when we needed it!



For some reason by Sunday Evening we are all really... Really.... Really!! tired.... And this is when we have pages and pages and pages and pages!!!!!!!!! of Sunday chants to get through! They are quite upbeat and fun, but the sanscript words are a jumble of letters that are really hard to pronounce and there Is nothing more daunting than opening to a five page long chant when all you want to do is be in bed!! :-)



In case you hadn&apos;t noticed the trend... We are all becomming really tired! :-) And another person has now left the course... We have been told that the emotional reactions people are having is because a purification process is occuring! Maybe! Maybe we are just jamming a lot into a very short time, constantly on the go, get up at the crack of dawn, do classes all day, study and homework in our breaks and eat two vegetarian only meals a day! I&apos;d still do it again though! :-)



We had a nice surprise during Satsung one evening where we watched a documentary of Dr Emoto and his work -  messages from water. It is really absolutely amazing. He and his team collect water from tap water and various other water sources (like waterfalls ) around the world and photograph it. Tap water generally doesn&apos;t form much, but free flowing water forms beautiful crystals. They then discovered that water they played music to developed more and more beautiful crystals and water surrounded by kind words, messages and thoughts did also. Water surrounded by negative words, messages, thoughts and vibes developed either nothing or fragmented ugly crystals!! And on every single occasion! It is absolutely amazing! And the photos are beautiful!!! You should google it!!! :-)



Even more so when you think that 70% of our body is made of water, and how it could relate, it really makes you wonder about possibilities!!



This week things started coming together, I suddenly realised that I wasn&apos;t just mumbling along to the chants anymore, but chanting the actual sanscript words and without even having the book in front of me. Nice! I guess it was bound to happen when we chant the same prayers at the start and end of every single class we do, so... easily five times a day... Every day! They are quite catchy and get stuck in my head now too. I think I will be singing them for some time to come after this!!



So it was same and same again thus week! The most out of the ordinary thing that probably happened was the Ashram Goats decided to join us in the Krishna temple on several occasions and they had to be chased out which was really quite amusing. :-)



Speaking of the temple.... Is it bad that my Favourite part of day is prassad? When we get to eat the offerings after morning and evening satsung! It is always delicious... And things we never get to see otherwise!! Fresh kiwi fruit, strawberries, dates, or ginger, walnuts, dried fruits.... Mmmmmm mmmm delicious.... I have to stop talking about it!!!!! :-)



But overall this week has gone so fast!! Literally the blink of an eye!



It seems we have covered sooooooo much and have so much to learn for our final exam next week, but still feel like we have sooooooo much to learn before we walk out of here as yoga teachers next week!! Crazy!!
 
Cake Week! Teaching, and my New name - Ambika! Sivananda Ashram, Val Morin, Quebec, Canada

2011-12-01 to 2011-12-08

Week Four!!

The schedule continued...! One morning on return from our silent meditation walk we came back via Swami Vishnu Devananda&apos;s house, or Samadhi zestates as it is known. It was beautiful! Two stories and right on a lake (he had changed it from a swamp), beavers, a bubbling creek, many statues of deities, surrounded by the snow covered trees.... beautiful! It did make me wonder though - we are not supposed to be attached to material things and here was this stunning estate...? But apparently it was for the greater good to be able to teach more students about yoga and it&apos;s philosophies as per his Plan for World Peace and not for his material gain.



Every day we sit in the Krishna temple, and everyday someone goes in to completely change Krishna&apos;s outfit before satsung in the morning! It is amazing the attention to detail and totally different outfit each day! It is always nice to go in each day to see the colours and designs that someone has carefully come up with!



We were lucky one evening to have some professional musicians come out and play the Sitar, (kind of like a looooooong guitar) tablas (two smallish to medium size hand drums played together), and guboh for us in a concert. It was Amazing! G.S. Sachdev was the main guys name. Three pieces were played and the final one with the guboh was some of the nicest and soothing music I have heard! So nice! I can&apos;t even describe the guboh... It was a little roundish thing about the size and shape of a small biscuit tin with kind of musical metal prong things and he lightly shook it! I was a fair few metres away so that is the best I can do sorry!!! It must be known as something else also as google can&apos;t even tell me what it is! Doh! :-)



This is also the week that one of my course mates referred to as &apos;Cake week&apos; after we had birthdays the 30 Nov, 2,3 and 4 th of December! Random hey! As much as I don&apos;t believe in star signs, maybe they are onto something with such a large percentage of sagittarius here!! :-)



And I was lucky enough to celebrate my birthday here too! The morning arrived with a silent meditation walk.... Or death march as I now refer to it! :-) We were led out of the Ashram in the dark, and straight into the forest! (Usually we stay on the road til dawn breaks) We immediately began tripping over roots and walking into trees attempting to find the path and with a couple of inches of loose snow and not yet frozen solid creeks and puddles it was a nasty surprise to slip and slide and slush down into water or oozing mud. Thank goodness for waterproof minus 40 boots that is for sure!



It was so hard to see where you were going and to follow the person in front of you rushing and almost slipping and tripping and then losing the way! Not fun! In the end we finally popped out onto a road and half the group was lost!! It didn&apos;t surprise me at all!  Luckily they were still on the path, just quite a way back and taking their time.



It was quite amazing though that all the hikes we did on little one person wide trails through all the beautiful untouched forest was all Ashram land! Amazing!



We had quite a delicious breakfast with cereal - which we hadn&apos;t seen in forever, the bread was fresh and there was home made hummus! I was tucking into my meal when a whole group of people came out of the kitchen holding a massive industrial tray cake complete with candles and singing happy birthday!



The whole ashram joined in as I blew out the candles and the mexicans sang the longest ever birthday song as we all bopped along which was really nice.



Then there was &apos;Om Tryambakam&apos; the life giving chant which I love and sounds so powerful when everyone is chanting! And then a little pressie beautifully wrapped with twirling ribbon and a little pink flower on the top, a card from the ashram and a little yoga book which was so nice!



And the cake was banana with a fruit topping too! My favourites!



It was a really Awesome day with so many lovely supportive people around who all wished me a happy birthday when they saw me, and lots of lovely

Emails from home.



Then that afternoon we had a Pregnancy yoga lesson too! We had to all come as pregnant with cushions stuffed up our shirts, regardless of age or gender so we could all experience the difficulties! So we had pregnant men, and pregnant 19 and 67 year olds! Too funny!



Although I&apos;m sure it was not even half as difficult as actually being pregnant, It was still quite the challenge to move around, attempt to get into postures (and somewhat fail!), stop arching the back, and quite heavy and tiring with the bean filled cushions!



It was super fun and interesting though and I think I may even specialise later on down the track. So much to learn though! Early days!! :-)



We also had a limited mobility class and it was so nice to hear how even people who are wheel chair bound can still do exercises to keep them healthy and improve their quality of life!



And then Kids yoga! This time we got to act like kids! We played games, acted out actions and sounds of postures with animal names, yelled and screamed, jumped and laughed and played and it was awesome! We even got to see techniques for dealing with difficult children as people in the class acted up they were disiciplined as the mats were rotated or we all counted out jumping jacks for their punishment. But overall it was just nice &apos;yo see how it let kids be kids but also got then interacting with each other and getting exercise!



Also super Interesting to see was the difference between a kid who lives in the ashram environment and does yoga and one who doesn&apos;t! Whoa!! I cannot even begin to describe!



During the week we also all completed teaching an open class which was such good fun and I only wish there was more opportunity to be able to do it!



There were lots of Funny corrections that people did as we toppled out of positions as we were pulled or pushed the wrong way for the balance points, but it was an awesome learning opportunity!



As usual we had the standard Classes on chanting, bhagavad Gita, pranyana (breathing), differences between yoga and other activities, the mind....



And what happens after death.... So in summary if we have achieved self realisation, that is it! But we don&apos;t know what... Otherwise our soul leaves our body and stays around until the friends and family begin to move on. It then heads to either heaven or hell (depending on what it had coming so to speak!) and stays there until it is reincarnated into its next lifeform, whatever that may be. And it is a perpetual cycle until self realisation is achieved.



We also had a tough day when one of our coursemates slipped on the icy stairs and had to be taken away by ambulance. Another girl had a back spasm and ended lain up in bed. Not nice :-(. But their spirits were so amazing I think we all learnt a lot from them and their attitudes!



The snow started to fall thick and fast this week as well and obe of my absolute favourite things here that I love is doing yoga and looking out the floor to ceiling windows to watch the snow falling on the beautiful grounds outside. Ahhhhh :-).



We had the option to choose if we wanted to be initiated into a mantra. A manta is a word ( such as Om) or phrase ( such as Om Namo Narayana) that you choose and use as your own personal mantra to repeat during meditation, when using mala beads ( like a rosary, it is a necklace of beads that you scroll through your fingers as you chant), during pranayama (breathing exercises) or any other time you may need it! There are many, mainly attached to Dieties, I.e., the mantra for Ganesha has the power of Ganesha, along with all his characteristics such as his ability to remove obstacles. So you choose the mantra or deity that means something to you, something you think you need in your life, something that you need to work towards, or have some affliciation to etc etc!



Those that had decided to get mantras had to get up early and shower, put on clean White or yellow clothes (luckily our uniform fits this description!! :-) ), make up an offering to give to the temple, and arrive to the Krisha temple at 0550h.



We all waited downstairs until it was time for us to be called up for our mantra initiations.



I was about 45 mins in as we just sat silently awaiting our turn. Two others had chosen the same mantra as I as we prostrated to the guru&apos;s, to Krishna, gave our offering and sat in front of Swami Ambikananda who performed the ceremony for us. I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect at all, but it was really moving as she described the qualities associated with our mantra, drew the ash and sandlewood across our foreheads representing the wisdom and third eye, as we chanted our new personal mantra. It was a really awesome experience as we completed the final prayer together and headed out for some silent mediation time. I wasn&apos;t sure at all what to expect, but was surprised how moving the ceremony was and I left feeling amazing!



During evening satsung, we all received spiritual names that are qualities that are seen in us and ones that we need to work towards. The Swami&apos;s sit down and ask for guidance from the guru&apos;s and they are then chosen and given to us. You can&apos;t change it! My name was called out and I was given Ambika - The Devine Mother who holds the responsibility of the world. Whew! A lot to work on! :-) It is a name of the Deity Durga who uses her 8 arms carrying weapons to remove all obstacles both within and out which us a nice thought. It was also super special as it was given to me by Swami Ambikananda... and also her name! So it was a nice thought that she saw qualities in me to pass on the name. ( Ambika was her spiritual name, and Nanda is the lineage of the guru - Swami Sivananda, so therefore her name becomes Ambikananda. )



As our fourth week drew to a close we learnt to do advanced pranayamas (breathing exercises) and then went through a two hour session. Hmm!



It is meant to give energy....  but all i got was a really restless and agitated mind that I could not shake all day! Hmm.  Not sure if it is worth it!! :-)



We also started moving into more advanced asana classes where we held postures for 6-8 minutes. Whoa! It definately requires some disicipline that&apos;s for sure!!!



One by one our roll call numbers were also being called out for us to lead chants at morning or evening satsung in the Krishna Temple. One morning I was quite tired sitting there when I heard &apos;17&apos; being called out. I flipped to page 17 in the kirtan book, but no one started.... &apos;17&apos; was called again and I realised! Oops, it was roll call number

17! I was up! I moved to the front, sat down in front of the microphone and started chanting the Ganesha chant I had previously picked out. Not used to singing into a microphone in front of crowds it was a little daunting at first, but totally awesome as it progressed!



A lady in the course also turned out to be a classical musician and sung for us Ave Maria! It was amazing!!!



And it was over! This week flew by in the blink of an eye! Well most of it.... That one hour Bhagavad Gita lesson after lunch still felt like the equivalent of a week! :-)
 
Graduation! Yoga Teacher Diploma Complete! Sivananda Ashram, Val Morin, Quebec, Canada

2011-12-09 to 2011-12-11

After the first week going slower than I would have ever thought possible, the last part raced by!



Our final day off was a study day which was so nice as we had soooo much to learn!!!



We also had a lovely walk through the snow to Samadi Estates - Swami Vishnu Devananda&apos;s house which is now a shrine. He had a gorgeous globe of the world and another of constallations, but what amazed me was the amount of things there for yogi&apos;s who aim to detach from material posessions!! There was literally thousands of books which was a bit of a shame they were not in the library for everyone to enjoy!



My back was soo sore! Doing yoga twice a day, thousands of backbends, sitting on the floor all day and a soft foam mattress with a giant dip in the middle just done of the reasons I put it down to! :-)



Krishna offered Thai Massages and so

I tried one.... And wow it hurt! It uses range of motion and stretching and everywhere he pulled and pushed and dug into the muscle hurt!! But it definately helped and felt good afterwards!



Exam day!!!! After our regular satsung we luckily got some bread and fruit for breakfast or i would never have been able to finish the exam! The Exam took place on the Floor of Krishna temple, as with all our main classes. The mats were set up in lines and we had a tray to lean on. Three and a half hours! Yep,  every muscle in the body was aching when I finished!! The exam was huge too! All short and long answer responses and probably 15 pages! It was epic!! I started out so confidently writing huge responses, but by the end I was so tired they became a lot briefer! It went forever! I was super glad though as I felt I was able to answer fairly confidently all questions except one! Not bad!



I was quite surprised about the amount of things we all had retained actually after having been running here there and everywhere all month and having covered so much, but it was awesome!!



Finished! We had to wait around the Ashram until 2pm so they could find us in case there was a problem with our test, but then free! We had passed!!! We went on a little outing into the town of Val David to see a funky yoga store - equilibrium, the town Christmas bazaar, which was closing up as we arrived, and then another funky little coffee shop. It was so beautiful with several inches of snow on everything, fresh snowflakes coming down, and all the trees looking like giant christmas trees from the movies!!



And then back for the yoga class!! Time??!!! What&apos;s that?!! :-)



Dinner was an absolutely amazing Mexican feast cooked by the Mexican&apos;s, and a lot of helpers under Swami Rajeshwarananda. We had tortilla soup, two different kinds of tofu filled enchalidas, salad with mango and pomogtanite, a spicy dressing, Mexican rice, black beans and guacamole!!!! And then rice pudding!!!! It was crazy!!! We had not eaten anything like that in forever and it was soo good!!!



The only problem was.....Thousands of dishes!! So everyone had an extra bowl or cup to fit everything and there were dozens more guests that had come in to help celebrate!! It was also a little daunting to walk into the kitchen and see so many used pots and pans and food everywhere, but everyone was so great as we had dozens of people helping! We finished with five minutes to spare before satsung and raced to get changed and arrive!



Abd Final satsung!!! We had speeches by the Swami&apos;s and Shivadas, and then one by one prostrated to the gods and masters and receive our diplomas! Well... Every name was called except mine..... Hmmm. Whilst they tried to find my certificate, and then went off and printed another for me, the whole room chanted Swami Vishnu Devananda&apos;s chant for World Peace - Om Namo Narayana. It took some time, so Gigi told me later I have probably singlehandedly brought about world peace from it! :-)



Each certificate is individually numbered and I am graduate number 28611! We also got our grades - mine being the second highest so that was quite good.



We then had another talent show! There were a few songs accompanied on guitar to start, and then adding up all the time comments Swami Rajeshwarananda had mentioned during our Bhagavad Gita lessons and main philosophy lectures, (&apos;remember that lesson we did?? About 2 years ago?!??! - In relation to how long it felt ) we had been studying it for ten years already! And yes, it truly felt it!!



Then a funny skit by Valerie on some of the hilarious things we had done as a class whilst learning to teach and correct - snot flying out of someone&apos;s nose whilst demonstrating proper breathing, students lying down proper up on one elbow to watch demonstrations, bringing people up from positions such as the seated forward bend and walking their arms up for them to demonstrate a straight back for the student to find the teachers crotch right in the face, some corrections where people tried to explain where the stretch was being felt and running their hands down the persons body, and many more!!



My room mates Valerie and Stephanie had everyone join together to sing John Lennon&apos;s &apos; Imagine&apos; which was really nice, and then the staff put out a runway of yoga mats towards Krishna and paraded down wearing the outfits of the ashram!



Swami Ambikananda came first as a super model with her giant hat and sunglasses..., and orange Swami outfit! Then we saw Shanti dressed as our yoga instructor Shivadas, tattoos and all! Then the outfit of the kitchen - croc&apos;s and apron, the mainteance outfit with old clothes, the modest yoga outfit and mat, and then the TTC outfit - White pants, yellow top and yellow book bag! It was quite funny the way they played it all up!



We had a grand finale with Miles and Erica getting Swami Rajeshwarnanda to beatbox (something she had said she wanted to do since the previous talent show!!) and Swami Ambikananda break dancing with Gigi to it!!! I never thought I would see people who are effectively monks beatboxing and breakdancing in their orange Swami outfits!! Brilliant!!!



We are constantly being told (constantly, like it comes up in every lecture!! :-) ) that for an action of selfless service we have to detach from the fruits of our labour, and so we laughed as GiGi and Valerie attempted to move themselves away from the pieces of fruit as we all finished.



And what a month!! It was over! It has been amazing, but I am dying for a chair to sit on, a supportive bed without a giant dip in the middle, a rest from backbends for my aching back, being able to eat more than twice a day, having more than thirty seconds a day to myself, and some other foods!!! Mmmm yoghurt! Mmm protein and iron!!!



I am definately going to miss the happy and supportive community and atmosphere, the fresh air, my improved flexability and strength, the great yoga classes each day, watching the snow fall on the mountains, having fresh delicious meals prepared for us,  the joining of everyone together to chant the prayer before meals, and the great people!



Everyone at ashram also has amazing glowing, dark bag and wrinkle free skin... So hopefully it says around too! :-)

Back in Van! Stacey&apos;s visit, Markets, and THE most amazing Christmas Lights ever! Vancouver, Canada

2011-12-17 to 2011-12-23

I am super happy to be back, in my own bed, with my own space, in less than freezing weather, and am looking forward to integrating some things I have learnt into my life with a more balanced diet, life, more natural products and exercise regime!



It is going to be tough but I am looking forward to it!



I definately have more energy, feel better and look less sickly so I really feel I achieved everything I needed towns more at the Ashram, even if it wasn&apos;t the relaxation I was expecting! :-)



I was not looking forward to getting back after an epicly long day travelling to have to unpack my room and set it all up again, but luckily it was clean from when the subletter had moved out (yay!), the sheets were easy to get to and everything else could wait!



The bathroom hadn&apos;t been cleaned in some time, the floor clearly had not been vacuumed and the fridge had quite a lot of mouldly food in it, but apart from that the apartment was actually less bad than I expected so that was a nice surprise!



It was awesome to come back and immediately have a birthday party that Ang had organised for Keith&apos;s 30th as a surprise, a Christmas drinks at my friend Michelle&apos;s house, and my good friend Stacey coming to visit from Australia!



Stace and I hit up the Vancouver Christmas Market (http://vancouverchristmasmarket.com/ ) conveniently located just a few blocks from my house! :-)



It was a &apos;traditional&apos; German market and so cute to wander around the little wooden stores to see all the beautifully made toys, decorations, various handicrafts, jewellery and food! We feasted on a stuffed baked apple with vanilla sauce and hot apple cider at the wooden tables. Perfect &apos;warm me up foood&apos; for the cold weather.



I was lucky enough to have a friend, Marc, who worked at the Capilano Suspension Bridge (www.capbridge.com) and gave us free tickets to go and check it out! Each year they put up 250 000 (yup!!!!!) Christmas lights and the entire place looks like a fairy tale!



You walk in and are surrounded by coloured &apos;christmas trees&apos; in all directions! It is magical!



Walking through the park we came across the Suspension bridge - a 450ft cable bridge swinging 230ft above capilano canyon! It was dark and all lit up beautifully so you couldn&apos;t really see the canyon, just the shadows of the valley and trees and lights everywhere! It did swing quite a bit though so you did have to hold on if you didn&apos;t want to stumble which was a bit discerning! I also felt a little motion sick when I got to the other side from all the swaying, but the fresh air soon got rid of that thankfully!



The other side was an equally magical land of lights, and a Treetop adventure - a series of cable bridges up to 100ft high through the forest canopy and around giant old trees. It was such a peaceful and beautiful walk high in the trees covered in lights and looking down onto the lit up paths, trees and reindeer below.



Walking back over the bridge we had a stunning view of this absolutely giant enormous Christmas tree that was decorated with thousands of different kinds of lights and was stunning!



We went across the cliff walk - a skinny one person wide semi circular walkway built out from the cliff face to get you right out into the canyon which was awesome! It had a series of bridges and walkways leading to and away from it through decorated trees and ponds - the exit being my most favourite place in the park I think!



The park was offering Gingerbread men decorating for christmas, so we grabbed our little men and icing and then feasted! It was great! We sat on the deck and listened to Marc and two colleagues play instruments and sing carols which was so lovely until the cold got the better of us and we headed out for the marathon bus wait to get home. Such a beautiful night!!! Thankyou Marc!! Unbelieveably amazing!!!



We walked town, checking out the yoga Studios for me, checked out Granville Island Market, walked the sea wall and Stanley Park and got some gorgeous weather showing the amazing city and mountains behind.



We also spent a super productive morning totally clearing out my closet! Brilliant! Everything that I had accumulated over the past ten months of actually being in the one place but did not need at all, and all the crappy backpacker clothes i had been carrying around for the past four years were finally sent on their way! We loaded up garbage bags and dropped everything off at the Salvation Army. So good!! You would have been impressed Bern! Now with all the clutter gone I can actually see what I have and use things that aren&apos;t just sitting on the top! Yay!



Another one of my goals for this year - to reduce &apos;clutter&apos; already on it&apos;s way to being achieved and the New Year is not yet even upon us! :-)


 
I&apos;m dreaming of a.... cold and rainy Christmas! Vancouver, Canada

2011-12-24 to 2011-12-28

How did this come up so fast?!! I could hardly believe it was here as Christmas Eve arrived and I jumped on the skytrain to head out to White Rock for Chrissie with the Canadian Cousins who had kindly invited me to stay!



Elmer picked me up from the bus stop and we dropped by Walmart to pick up a few groceries. Wow! It was busy and  there were massive empty shelves where they were entirely out of fresh produce! It was crazy!



I managed to skype a few people back home which was awesome; and being in the lovely decorated cozy home with Kay and Elmer it was finally starting to feel like Christmas also!!



And Christmas arrived!!! It was cold... but alas, not White.... Just rainy!!



There were going to be 14 people for dinner and so Kaye and I got busy in the kitchen!! There were veg to prepare, many dishes to make and a huge turkey to stuff and cook ready for the traditional big Christmas dinner.



Kay and I even had matching Christmas aprons to get us into the festivities!



We finished the prep just in time for the family to start arriving and all settled down in front of the cosy fireplace as presents were exchanged.



I was even surprised with some awesome pressies which I was totally not expecting at all and so lovely! I have been away from home for so long it was the first time I had received any on Christmas Day in years so it was super exciting!



And after seeing it in countless American movies i finally got to try Egg nog! Quite delicious!! Very Sweet though, but a bit of ice and cut with milk - perfect! Just don&apos;t read the ingredients on the back of the carton....!! :-)



It was so funny having a cold christmas with the Beers just sitting out the back door cooling in the outside air! It also was the second &apos; refridgerator&apos; when we ran out of room inside for the leftovers!



And it was time for the feast!! We crowded around the table as dish after dish after dish were passed around and our plates quickly loaded before the next dish arrived!!



There was everything! Turkey, stuffing, squash and zucchini, yams, onions, mashed potatoes, cabbage, cabbage rolls, peas, corn, beet salad, Brussels sprouts, gravy, cranberry and more I can&apos;t even remember! It was soooo delicious!!! Mmmm my first real traditional hot Christmas dinner!



And then Christmas Pudding which was served with a White sauce made with milk, flour to thicken, sugar, butter, alcohol to flavour and then a beaten egg White!



We also had the Best cracker toys ever! There were all kinds of things, mine being a large sturdy clip and strong magnet and calculator attached! Actually handy!



Migrating full and happy to the lounge room and sitting around the Fire chatting was so cosy, but so odd compared to Christmas at home in the sun!



Even the dishes somehow were not even too extreme! Nice!



And then after a day of rest and going downstairs with plate and fork and eating a buffet table full of leftovers in the cold air of the additional makeshift refridgerator..... it was time to do it all over again!! Alenna and her girls were in Disneyland for Christmas and so the immediate family ( ...and I :-) ) returned for lunch!



A delicious turkey soup and then more pressie exchanges by the cozy fire, testing out new toys, lots of chatting and snacks and Christmas was over for another year!



It was fantastic! And I am just so lucky to have such amazing welcoming extended family here!



I hope everyone had a merry Christmas and fun break with their friends or families wherever you may be in the world this year!! Xxx
 
Happy New Year 2012! Polar Bear Swimming! Vancouver, Canada

2012-01-01

The English Bay Polar Bear swim is one of the oldest in the country... so the perfect Canadian way to see in the New Year! ( http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2011/12/polar-bear-swim-vancouver-2012-at-english-bay/ )



I found out about this tradition as I was dared to go in it my the cousins at Christmas... I don&apos;t think they thought i would though!! :-)



The idea is to wash off the old and start with the new, with more than 2100 people braving the cold for the 92nd annual swim!! Similar events are held all over Canada... some need a path cut through ice for people to even get in... brr! Maybe next year....! :-)



I had met a few fellow couchsurfers as we pushed through the crowds to register and then down towards the beach!



The water was a balmy 7&apos;C and the outside a lovely 5&apos;C as we congregated in the crowd, waiting for the signal to move forward. The barriers were pulled down and we all surged forward into the beach area and quickly stripped off. As an Aussie I am clearly used to sand that burns my feet... not sand that freezes it!!!!



We all headed towards the water as the lifeguard blew the whistle and we were off and racing in!



There were a lot of flailing arms and I caught a rogue elbow to the cheekbone for a nice bruise to start the new year! Luckily it was immediately iced!! Unperturbed we continued running forward and splashed into the water. WOW!!! It was ridiculous!!! Like unbelievable!! Like nothing I can even describe! People started immediately running back out as we continued to push forward and then dove in to start the 50m swim out to the turn around point at a boat. Boat? What boat? I never saw a thing as we slowly lost feeling in our limbs and sloooooooooooooooowed riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight doooooooooooooooooooown. I turned around and Francis was just behind me. We just looked at each other with wide eyes and both slowly shook our heads and tried to turn around and head back. No way!!! Our bodies would have shut down and died!!!



You kind of get pain and then lose the feeling in your limbs... and it&apos;s not a really nice feeling at all!



We staggered out of the water, our toes so frozen they were painful to walk on, and they didn&apos;t unfreeze for a good hour afterwards as we hobbled around the city! The bonus was that the air felt positively warm now though!! We attempted to dry off, our feet so cold we couldn&apos;t even be bothered to get the sand off our feet as we just shoved them into socks and shoes to get them off the freezing sand. Not so fun later though when we started to get feeling back and realised we were walking on what felt like full covering of crappy rock like sand in our socks!



A lot of people were dressed up... i am not sure if this helped or hindered them! But quite entertaining anyway! Probably some were still coming home from the night before by the looks of things too!



There were soooo many thousands there spectating as well, it was crazy! The entire beach was packed, and a lovely restaurant was handing out cups of hot apple cider for all the swimmers as well! SO nice! And SO needed as we desperately tried to thaw out!



In fact, I don&apos;t think I warmed up all day! Even as we sat in a Korean Restaurant and ate hot pots in our thermals and jackets still!



It felt so invigorating and so brilliant afterwards though.... just that whole frozen toe thing and pain in the water. Still it&apos;s already becoming a blur... guess that means I will be back in there next year!! :-)



But an amazing start to the New Year! It was awesome!! Happy New Year Everyone!! :-)



I also enjoyed ringing in the New Year with my good friend Michelle and other friends at a Turducken feast! We had bison, and the chicken inside the duck inside the turkey... and all layers wrapped in bacon. I had heard about it for years and finally got to try it! A lot of work going into preparation, but delicious!
 
2012! Hare Krishna&apos;s, Liquor Store, Snow and Free Stuff! Vancouver, Canada

2012-01-02 to 2012-01-20

After a great start to the New Year, I headed out to the Brahma Kumaris meditation centre, (http://www.bkwsu.org/canada ) a cute little place with amazing Cardomen Cake! Super friendly people, and everything they do free as a community service.



I attended a &apos;JAM&apos; and Chai night, standing for &apos;just a minute&apos; where they spoke about the importance of taking just a minute for yourself throughout the day to sit back, meditate and then put you in a better position going forward. It was actually really well done and interesting as we listened to a pianist play and then talked in small groups about things that we felt we holding us back, or something you always struggled with, or put you in a negative mood, before writing them down and symbolically crumpling them and and throwing them in the bin.



We then looked at what we wanted to achieve, how we could do it, and positive ways of thinking and reframing, before a final meditation session. It was really interesting!



I also tried out several different yoga kirtan (chanting) nights, and yoga open houses which were interesting.



The funniest thing was deciding to head to the Hare Krishna temple (http://www.vancouver.iskcon.ca/ ) one Sunday Evening for their Sunday Feadt and Chanting as I was missing that upbeatness of the Ashram and thought it may be similiar.



I walked in to the temple and randomly ran into people I had briefly met at other yoga events!! So random!!!! So that was nice to hang out with them as we listened to the Bhagavad Gita readings, Hare Krishna chanting, were everyone was up, playing instruments, swaying and dancing and chanting along with the music which was a really nice atmosphere. Hare Krishna&apos;s just worship Lord Krishna, so the only chant was &apos;hare Krishna, hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, hare, hare&apos; for about 45 minutes, but it was still interesting!



We then had the Sunday feast with lentil dahl, rice, beans and potatoes, and the traditional prassad, a sweet sugar butter rice.



So interesting experience, but quite a way to go and not quite what I was after! :-)





Whilst waiting forever for the temp agenciesto getback to me with a job, my friend Michelle hooked me up with a job at the Liquor store where she used to work in the interim.



Within a day, I had my first drunken customers, at11am on a weekday! Who the manager had to escort out.



Clearly not my first choice of job, but it was actually quite fun as the staff and customers were all super friendly, and it was Interesting people watching.



It&apos;s actually quite a good place to work as people have just finished work and are happy or getting a gift, going out with friends or to a party!



Regulars also learnt our names and were so lovely, chatting all the time and one lady, Bev even brought us snacks from the supermarket opposite!



I feel a little sad sometimes though watching the same customers come in each day looking all down and buy a mickey of vodka to tuck into their inside coat pocket, or several bottles of red wine to consume themselves.



Here if you return bottles and cans to liquor stores you get a deposit back, and it is also tough watching homeless people spend their days trawling through garbage and collecting cans to return - 24 maximum at a time. They are always so happy and so polite though so it make you kind of wonder about other people who have everything and are grumpy and rude! I guess it is nice also that they do have that opportunity to do something and make some money, albeit 10c a can/ bottle. Really good for the environment too!



The worst part for sure was stocking the fridge... Not fun! Dressed like an Eskimo, every exposed skin covered, you could be inside the freezingness for up to an hour. Brrrrrr!!!



Night shift was also not fun!! I am definately not a night shift worker that is for sure!



And then it got cold!!! yay!!! We had super pretty snow across the city!!!! So beautiful!! Kind of makes it hard to  Ride to work though!! Back to the transit! :-)



And Highs of -6! Surprisingly it is not as painful as I thought it would be... Except if you are out in it too long and you lose the feeling in your nose and lips and fingers! Or the pain when you try and ride and the cold air rushes against your face and fingers. Brrr!!



I also was making use of the freecycle website - www.freecycle.org to get rid of things I didn&apos;t need, and get some things I wanted that others no longer needed and were giving away! I managed to get a new phone, lots of spanish books and a breadmaker for free, which is something I had always wanted! It feels a bit dodgy rocking up to a strange persons house in the dark after work to get them, but I am used to doing weird things, I am a couchsurfer after all! :-)



And so I started baking my first bread!! Delicious!!!
 
The arrival of Mark Bench. Vancouver, Canada

2012-01-20 to 2012-01-23

I had an email one day from my good friend Marty (who I was at RMC with) saying there was a cheap flight to Vancouver and he had a week off and was thinking about taking it up. So I emailed back saying &apos;awesome&apos; and he literally booked it and jumped on the plane the next day!!! Brilliant!! Random awesomeness!!!



I was unfortunately on my yoga teacher mentorship so I couldn&apos;t pick him up; and to avoid him spending several hours sitting around waiting after travelling for 30 hours, I devised a plan where my local Starbucks conveniently offered to hold the key for him!



So I dropped off an envelope with his name on it, sent an email detailing directions to find the starbucks and my house as got off the plane, navigated the transit system, walked into the starbucks, picked up the key and then successfully found his way to my apartment in downtown!



It cracked me up when I arrived home to find him sitting on the couch chilling out after his little scavenger hunt to get here! It was awesome!



We started to pull out my thermarest and sleeping bag to set up a bed for him when an email came through to me...



&apos;Hey Karinya,



I have just been offered a job so wont be coming back. Don&apos;t think I have anything important in my room.

Can you please forward me iyuri email addy so I can tell him as I don&apos;t have it.

I will email him and ask him to give you enought from my deposit to cover bills etc.

Was nice living with you.



Craig&apos;



I was like &apos;what the?!!&apos; He had told me he was going boarding for a few days at one of the resorts! I quickly ran to his room and found it cleaned out!! I will never understand some people! The lease was actually up this month as well so he wasn&apos;t even committed to anything he had to break! SO weird!! As I stood there in shock, Marty and I both turned to look at each other at the same time &apos; free bed!!&apos;. And so it perfectly worked out for Marty to have his own room for his stay!! Couldn&apos;t have been any more perfect timing if we tried!!



The next day we decided that we should go and see a Vancouver Canucks Ice Hockey game! Unfortunately it was a really popular game and so there were no reasonable tickets left anywhere. I tried craigslist (our version of gumtree) and sorted through the posts that were there.



One had tickets at their face value and a phone number so I quickly called. Alas it went to message bank and I left a message, realising that I would be one of a trillion messages and the tickets would already be gone.



Ten minutes later my phone rang and it was Gary! Somehow he had just posted and I was the first message he received! Wow! What random luck!! We were to meet him that afternoon conveniently right near my house. It was meant to be!



We headed out into the lovely welcoming Vancouver rain to &apos;The Elbow Room&apos; - http://www.theelbowroomcafe.com/zgrid/proc/site/sitep.jsp -just a few blocks from my house with the motto &apos;Food and service is our name. Abuse is our game (so have fun!).



It was set up like an old American Diner with the plasticy and silver chairs and tables and signed photos of various stars all over the walls. The server there, Patrick was so crazy we couldn&apos;t help but laugh, very gay and flamboyant we spent the whole meal laughing at him as he took the piss out of things. It took us about 20 minutes to order though as we couldn&apos;t get a word in!



It wasn&apos;t really &apos;abuse&apos; like the website offered, but there were only us and two other people in there so I think it would be a bit of a different atmosphere if it were full. You had to get up and get our own drinks - coffee, water etc and it was fun.



The food was really great, tasty fresh and homecooked, even if we did have to make a donation to the charity they support - Loving Spoonful&apos; assisting to provide meals for people with aids as we didn&apos;t finish our meals! The girls across from us had a &apos;pancake&apos;. it was literally half an inch thick and the size of a baking tray! Awesome!



We walked around downtown and headed to meet Gary to pick up the Canucks tickets. We were a bit worried about it being a scam or fake tickets, but he seemed so genuine, offered all his personal details and drivers licence that we decided he was so lovely if we had been had, then he deserved the money! :-)



We headed over to Ryan and Christie&apos;s for a games night and then up early the next morning to start showing the now spare room in the apartment for new tenants!! It was the easiest it had ever been.... hmm I am now onto my 9th room mate in 11 months!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh... it&apos;s not me I swear!! :-) (and there were 2 couples so that bumped numbers up a bit too! :-) ).



We found a super cool Canadian chick, Lohifa and yay, room taken!! Usually you have to sort through about 100 emails from potential crazies and do about 5 viewings! I had sorted maybe 10 emails and one viewing time with four people and found her straight away. Perfect!



It was then time!!! We headed to Rogers Arena, a few blocks away and joined the thongs of people dressed in the blue, green and white heading in to watch the Canucks game.



We were pushed along with the hordes as we entered the team store and then down to the lower levels to watch the teams warm up. We took our seats as the anthems were sung, and the singer stopped for the entire crowd to sing the anthem aloud, it was amazing!



And then we were off! It started out brilliantly as we scored a goal within the first two minutes. Alas, the San Jose sharks were soon to follow, and it stayed tied for the entire game. With five minutes to go, we scored again to put us in the lead... followed by San Jose literally 30 seconds later!! And then a minute later again! Luckily we managed to hold them out for a 4-3 win.



Our seats were amazing in that we had a great view of the ice and also the crowd as each time the puck went in the net, the entire crowd jumped to its feet in one movement, arms waving and cheering literally instantaneously as the puck hit the net. It was awesome!!



The stadium was at capacity - 18800 - and the crowd was awesome! Totally buzzing, cheering and an amazing atmosphere. Much nicer than when I went to see the Canucks go down to the Blues last year!
 
The world of brokers, Vancouver, Canada

2012-01-30 to 2012-02-17

And finally after two weeks of night shift almost killing me, I decided that I wasn&apos;t willing to risk my health after I had taken so long and worked so hard to get it back, and by Monday I would have a new job.



And the universe aligned! Thank goodness!!! I am now at a big real estate firm working for brokers.



It is basically an office full of men who got to much money, too fast and never grew up! (And when I say money, I mean LOTS of money... like millions...) Sure, one on one they are lovely, but listening to their conversations in our open plan office has me constantly shaking my head.



Money, clothes, box suites,how their life is so tough they have to go and watch the game AGAIN, girlfriends and then wives in the next breath (yes, of course they are cheating :-( ) alcohol, pot, other drugs, strip clubs.... On repeat!



And long lunches where they come back Slightly drunk several times a week!!



One of them put it quite well - &apos;there are a lot of ego&apos;s in this office&apos;. To put it mildly!



The couple that top the cake so far are the day one&apos;s wife came in to drop off a treat and wrote a little note. When the broker came back in he totally hit the roof and went off on a rant as to why she was here, what she was doing, whether she opened any drawers, looked on his computer!!! It was crazy!!!!!! And she was just doing something nice for him! I was totally shellshocked! That poor lady!!! And the worst is everyone knows he is cheating apparently... Except her :-(.



Another day we were calmly sitting working listening toons of the brokers on the other side of the partian to us chat to a client, when we hear something that I can only describe as a &apos;kerfuffle&apos; as the broker in the middle of a conversation on the phone was attacked by another!!!! What the?!!!!?!! I have no idea what it was about, and nor do I care. Money, territory or girls apparently. But ridiculous. I can&apos;t even describe how utterly ridiculous and childish!!! We all sat there eyes wide, going what the ?!?!!!!???!!!?



There is one that I just shake my head at as he drinks his water from a champagne glass! Those things are tiny, they are so impractical! But I don&apos;t know... obviously it makes him feel good and earn more money! :-)



There was also an awards night when I was there... I did not go, but the brokers started leaving around 3pm-ish to head off to some pre pre drinks at the strip club. Apparently they then all turned up absolutely loaded to the event and had to perform burnings / roastings/ kangaroo courts (which ever of those names that makes sense to you! :-) ) totally smashed! Apparently they were like &apos;He is a wonderful father... husband... boyfriend....&apos; about their womanising ways and extra curricular out of office activities.



The top broker for the year then paid for the after party... I was shocked that one person was required to pay for it.... until I found out the amount of money we were talking they make.... I heard of a 140 million dollar deal... so with fees of anywhere between 1-7%, I guess that one deal makes him somewhere from $140,000 to $980,000.... the amount of money most of us will never see together at one place ever! So yes, I guess he CAN afford it!!



It is kind of crazy though... making that kind of money off other people.... and it seems so unjust when there are so many people making minimum wage and working so much harder!!



but anyway! Back to the party! I arrived at work the next morning at 9am as usual to find champagne bottles and cider around our admin desks, and a ladies ear ring. Hmm must have been a good night! The office was also totally empty as people struggled in anywhere from 11am to 2pm, complaining of being out til 5am, coming back to the office to party, and having lost their overcoats, blackberry&apos;s and car keys. I was quite shocked at their laid back attitude to it all, but apparently it happens all the time, so they are used to it!! Sad!!



That aside, time to find a new job again!!!! :-) apart from all these things, i dont mind staying as the admin team i work with are lovely. We all even got given valentines day presents from the boss! Ahh how sweet!



I am learning HTML&apos;s to do signs for properties which is quite interesting, and it is an awesome location and hours!!! And typing up property lists make me laugh too.... selling points were &apos;great parking&apos;. Hmmm.  :-)



The conversations I hear make me shake my head constantly, but it has offered an amazing insight into a world i had no idea existed!!!

Learning how to be a real yoga teacher! Vancouver, Canada

2012-02-25 to 2012-02-26

After having such an amazing time at the Sivananda Ashram in Quebec at the end of the last year, and getting so much out of it, I knew that I wanted to continue with my yoga teaching. However, the qualification I had was a particular style that we did not have here in Vancouver and not enough for me to be teaching &apos;mainstream&apos; yoga so to speak. I also did not have the experience to e able to be going straight into a class. Sivananda yoga has a particular sequence where you could either do a beginner course, or open class, it was not something that you could teach to a room full of beginners and advanced together. It required some teaching to get the breathing exercises down, as well as the sun salutations we did, and you couldn&apos;t just head straight into a class and start off with a headstand anywhere else! It worked fine for Sivananda and I loved it, but it was not going to help me go into a studio and teach without doing some serious learning on sequencing!!



I started researching and found a six week mentorship program being offered by Yyoga, our largest studio here, and immediately applied! I was super happy to be accepted into the program, although there was a slight hiccup just before it started when I was told the program was full, but after going in and chatting with them they realised the error and I was back in!



I was allocated an amazing mentor - Janet - who has about 20 years experience and is both an amazing teacher and amazing person. After never having met her, been to her classes or known her individuality style of teaching, she turned out to be exactly what I was after in her teaching practice to model my own on! It was fantastic!!!



Janet also had another mentee - Glenn- who was equally as amazing, and was a fantastic and supportive person and so helpful to bounce ideas off! I was so lucky to have the two of them, they really made the program for me and allowed me to learn and grow so much!



The program worked by me assisting and shadowing Janet in one of her hatha classes each week, a thursday night class. Each week I did slightly different, I started as a student, then observing and taking notes, then assisting with corrections and then taking the initial centering and final relaxations.



We also had a couple of awesome little workshops with just the three of us on making sure we had particular movements right, how to teach particular postures, and how to do corrections for others, it was really interesting and helpful.



It was very very overwhelming for me though as it just seemed there was so much to learn and so much that i didn&apos;t know and I wondered if it was worth going on, and how I was ever going to get to where I needed / wanted to be! Someone told me though that you have to start somewhere! That no one expects you to know everything and to just teach what I knew, as I knew a lot of things that i could impart to people, and not worry about what I didn&apos;t! Very good advice!



The final component was where I taught &apos;by donation&apos; classes at various centres. My first one arrived and it was Flow, so not the traditional hatha I was more versed in. I wanted to try it as I liked inversions and sun salutations that were a part of this style, but I wasn&apos;t sure at all how to do the sequencing. Janet assisted changing my plan around, but I was still stressing all week about it... I even had this nightmare where 70 people turned up and then proceeded to just walk out as I taught!!!



My friend Harry put it all in perspective again for me though when he said &apos;why are you stressing? Isn&apos;t yoga supposed to relax you?!&apos; Ahh another lightbulb moment! :-)



So I was still worried, but also excited as I headed out to the centre I was teaching at. I hadn&apos;t been there before, but it was so warm and inviting and had such a nice atmosphere I immediately felt at ease. The class was small, just 4 people, so a great number to start, and I started going so fast through my sequence I then had to think on my feet and add some extra postures which was good training! I finished perfectly on time which was awesome and they all said &apos;thankyou!!&apos; so I hope it was okay!! It went well, but I did not feel confident at all with the Flow sequencing... in fact I felt quite the fraud! But I looked forward to teaching hatha next!!!



The next one was a totally packed out full room with 20 people! My mentor Janet came, my fellow mentee Glenn, and a couple of other mentees from the program, as well as about five of my friends and a whole bunch of others!! It was great!! But totally totally packed! There was JUST enough room for everyone and not much room for me to even walk around, let alone for everyone not to hit each other with arm movements in the postures!



I immediately felt so much more confident teaching the hatha class and thoroughly enjoyed it! It went really well and it cemented in my mind that for now, hatha teaching was what I enjoyed!



Another busy week trying to work out another sequence, and getting Janet to fix it so I had the relevant counter postures, proper flow and preparatory exercises for what I was planning, and then trying to learn it and make sure I was doing it all right!



My final class was at another location again, in a large room with ten people. It again went really well, i thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was so lovely at the end when people came up and thanked me. There was an older lady who came up to say that she was almost 80 and she just loved the class. She started doing yoga a couple of years ago after her husband passed away and she had osteoporosis and a knee injury. She said she is now fine and pain free, is able to do everything and feels fantastic. And she certainly looked it too! She said that she always feels so good when she leaves the class that it just makes her want to keep coming back! Ahhh it was so sweet! It made me feel good for hours!



That is the other thing I love about yoga, there is an 80 year old lady, a 20 year old girl and a 30 year old guy all in the same class all being challenged by the activity! Not many &apos;sports&apos; were you could boast that!!



And so drew to an end the mentorship! I feel I have come a long way from not even teaching anyone except a couple of other fellow teacher trainees in a particular one form Sivananda sequence to being able to teach a room full of beginners / open a sequence I had worked out myself with proper form, alignment, music, props and everything that I had never done before! Sure, I still used my notes to refer to, but you have got to start somewhere! I was definitely proud of myself and definitely loved it! I am seeing more and more benefits to yoga the more I am involved with it.



I now am looking for my next action plan to continue my yoga teacher learning! Definitely great to get a head start, learn so much more about proper teaching and correct movements and meet some great people in the yoga community!

Visits from Ruth and Ahnah! Vancouver, Canada

2012-03-15 to 2012-03-18

And so spring arrived! Oh wait, what&apos;s going on here? After a random hot spell, the first day of spring arrived with sun, wind, snow, sleet, rain, wind, and all of the above all over again! It was crazy! And then a cold spell! Such bizarre weather! it never fails to amaze me that it is a genuine topic of conversation here, but it really does dictate your life!!



And with it came Ruth, an old family friend I have known my entire life, but not seen for a good ten years I would say! Ruth was visiting with her boyfriend Steve and we managed to catch up one evening at a Caribbean Restaurant - Calabash! And then onto Yaletown for some drinks. It was so awesome to see her again and hear all about her awesome trip!



And the next weekend Ahnah arrived in town!!! ................ TBC



I also had the arrival of my Costco card... quite exciting new, believe it or not! :-) Given to me by mum&apos;s friend Betty as her air miles were expiring. So good as it is really close to me and has such good bargains! I love that store! And if you go at lunch, dozens of samples to choose from! Mmmm samples! :-)

I believe that we will win!!Vancouver Southsiders, Whitecaps Supporters, BC Place, Vancouver, Canada

2012-03-24

A friend who is a member of the Southsiders, Vancouver Whitecaps Major League Soccer team supporters asked me to head to a home game against DC United.



The Southsiders are the Whitecaps Soccer team supporters that sit in the south side of the stands... hence the name! Every home game they march from the supporters pub on Granville Street down to the match at BC Place.



We joined about 150 others as the scarfs were held, flags waved and megaphones were out for the chants! It was super fun as everyone was just super happy and friendly walking along singing and excited to be heading to the match.



The chants were really quite catchy as well, new words to &apos;Take me Home, Country Roads&apos;, to &apos;Boundary Road&apos; - from the time when the Whitecaps were at a different field and that was the road that led to the stadium. Repeating, &apos;I&apos; &apos;I believe&apos; I believe that&apos; etc etc to end up at &apos;I believe that we will win&apos; with everyone repeating and bouncing up and down, arms in the air. It created such atmosphere! There was a massive amount of chants to, all different and catchy!



I cant find a copy of this weeks march on youtube yet, but this is the last one - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfmYnsOCdLM.



Arriving at the stadium, there were 19,394 fans to watch the match against DC United. The southsiders stand (yep, stand on their feet the entire game!), chant and wave flags the entire game so it was a much different perspective to being in the regular seats in the rest of the stadium... so much more fun!! I don&apos;t think I will ever watch another match from the regular boring seats again now I know about this section!! Unfortunately it was a final score of 0-0, but so much fun! I can see why people head out there to support every week! It is crazy dedication though - the guys get to the supporters bar early to set up a team shop, organise hundreds of people, and then lead the chants with the megaphones down the very front and miss a good 80% of the game as they are always facing in to the crowd leading the chants! They also put out the banners before the match and then hang around to pack them all up and put them in storage afterwards. You must love it to be able to do that constantly and not get fed up with it all!!

An Amazing Easter Backcountry Adventure, Keiths/Cerise Creek Hut, Duffey Lake Pass, BC, Canada

2012-04-05 to 2012-04-07

After several weeks of emails back and forth and all kinds of questions about our adventure, we were ready! Justin, Michelle, Jena, Hugh, Sheila and I were headed out for an Alpine adventure in the backcountry! Hugh and Justin are experienced backcountry skiers and had kindly offered to take us along on the adventure with them!



We completed an online avalanche course - http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/training/online-course - which was really interesting and I learnt about things I had no idea I knew nothing about! There are so many different types of avalanches to start! Firstly how it forms with the snowpack layering, different types of avalanches, how to recognize lurking danger, what can set them off, and their destructive potential! So much to learn!



Everyone needs safety devices, and our first time in the backcountry, Jena, Michelle and I had reserved our avalanche snow safety kits at MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop store) including a beacon, probe and shovel, and headed off to do a training session with Justin at the Justin School of Avalanche training!



So in summary - All group members need an avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe for companion rescue. This is essential equipment for travel in avalanche terrain and knowing how to use it is just as important as carrying it.



You need to wear your transceiver, probe and shovel on your body or in a small pack that you wear at all times.



All bindings should be releasable. Non-releasable bindings could drag you to the bottom of an avalanche.



Check your clothing and equipment to ensure that you have everything you need for the conditions and that each item functions properly. For group gear, be sure everyone knows who is responsible for carrying which pieces of vital equipment. Test all transceivers in both transmit (send) and receive (search) modes and make sure your probe and shovel are in working order.



When a person is buried in an avalanche, minutes can make the difference between life and death. You can waste tens of minutes if you don’t use this gear effectively – especially when it comes to shovelling.



TRANSCEIVER

Avalanche transceivers are small electronic devices worn by all members of a team. When travelling, everyone sends out a radio signal; in the event of an avalanche those not buried switch to search mode and follow the signal towards a buried person.



PROBE

Transceivers get you close fast, a probe is how you actually find someone. Probes are like sectional tent poles that snap together. An assembled probe inserted in the snow in a systematic pattern lets you physically pinpoint someone under the snow so you don’t waste time digging.

240 cm is the shortest standard length which works fine in drier climates and for rescue; if you’re in deeper snowpack areas or using it for snowpack observations consider a 320 cm version.



SHOVEL

A good shovelling technique can save you tens of minutes if you’re trying to get someone out of a 150cm deep hole! But you need the right tool – it has to fit in your pack, but within reason bigger is better. Plastic breaks in cold temperatures and hard avalanche debris! An extendable shaft is important. A flat top that provides a platform for stepping on is valuable when chopping blocks.

So we learnt about all the above! And then practiced our drills - hiding one transceiver under a blue tarp in the backyard, securing our personal transceiver, putting on a backpack with our gear and going through the sequence, checking behind us to make sure it is safe, finding the run out zone at the base of the avalanche where the snow rests and accumulates, looking for signs of a person, and then starting the walking pattern following the numbers, beeping and arrows on the transceiver to attempt to locate the missing ‘person’. When we identified we were close with the transceiver, we marked out an area, and began probing until we hit something, left the probe in and began digging, even a particular technique to make sure that we weren’t creating a foxhole or building up a pile of snow.

It was definitely an amazing experience and something that I never even knew existed, let alone thought I would be doing!



The weather conditions were checked - http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-28_metric_e.html , the avalanche forecast zone checked - http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/bulletins/latest/south-coast and we were on for an awesome Easter Weekend at Cerise Creek Hut (also known as Keith’s hut) in the Duffey Lake Pass - http://www.trailpeak.com/trail-Cerise-Creek-near-Pemberton-BC-1093 ! Brilliant!!



We headed home to pack multitudes of cold weather clothing and the next morning we hit the road to head north to begin our adventure! We had two car loads as we drove along the sea to sky highway and met at a little coffee house before finishing the drive along the stunning highway with snow capped mountains each direction we looked. It was beautiful! And just a three hour drive from the city!



We were the only cars on the road as we headed in to find the trailhead. Unfortunately, as we arrived we noticed the majority of cars parked all had their drivers window smashed and thieves had gone through their belongings - so not a very nice surprise for the people when they returned from their weekend away. A lot of the cars had signs in the windows asking the thieves to spare their windows and we just hoped for the best as we locked everything we could in the trunk and packed up ready to go!



Hugh was skiing in and Justin had a split snowboard – super cool -and another thing I never knew existed! Literally a snowboard that splits in half so you can effectively cross country ski in, but then seal together, change the bindings and convert to a snowboard to board down! They also had traction covers called skins they attached to the bottom of their ski’s/board so that they could have grip whilst going along the trails. Super cool!



The rest of us got into our snow pants, layers, and gloves, ensured our transceivers were strapped on appropriately, tested and on; strapped on our snowshoes, shouldered the packs and we were off!!



We climbed up the snow bank and along the trail, the first part straight into a slope, no easing into it! Sweet! We then crossed a narrow snow covered log across a river holding an inconveniently placed rope and the adventure had really begun! It was absolutely amazing walking through the snow covered trees and looking up to see gorgeous snow covered peaks all around you. Stunning! It was harder than I had expected though! I expected to more or less breeze through it, after having done a fair bit of hiking, but it is a totally different experience and a whole new dimension doing it all on snow with snow shoes that is for sure! It was an amazing calf workout as we powered up steep hills and held our balance as we shuffled over narrow paths next to tree wells...



(A tree well is a void or area of loose snow around the trunk of a tree enveloped in deep snow which present danger to hikers, snowshoers, skiers, and snowboarders who fall into them.

A tree&apos;s branches shelter its trunk from snowfall, allowing a void or area of loose snow to form. Low-hanging branches as on small firs further contribute to forming a tree well, as they efficiently shelter the area surrounding the trunk. Such wells have been observed as deep as 20 feet. They can also occur near rocks and along streams. Victims can get trapped in tree wells and become unable to free themselves. In two experiments conducted in North America 90% of volunteers temporarily placed in tree wells were unable to rescue themselves.

Frequently victims end up in wells head first, complicating recovery efforts. Often they are injured in the process, suffering joint dislocation or concussion. )



... and alongside streams and slopes.



We went through a mix of flat, steep and gradual uphills, slight declines, open country, and weaving through the trees. It was amazing! Coming into the trees was a challenge as you tried not to get anything caught on the branches and often there was just narrow paths – one point really quite steep as we all tried to pull ourselves up with assistance from the branches.



We were becoming quite exhausted as we continued our uphill slog and final push towards the hut. It was really tough work!! And even harder when you stepped off the trail those ahead had created and you sunk a good few feet into the snow!



And then suddenly to our left was a group practicing their avalanche safety drills and a tent coming up on the right. We had made it! We gladly dropped our packs and began site selection for the tents. Quite an involved process! Firstly picking a suitable flatish area, then stomping down the snow in snowshoes to pack it in (actually not as quick as that just made it sound!!); shovelling out any parts that were not flat, re-stomping to ensure its stability and even ness. We then took our snowshoes off and promptly sunk over a foot down into the nice flat ground we had just created and had to start again! Yup, definitely not as easy as it sounds!!



In the end we decided lumpy and holey was fine as we pulled out the tent and started to put it up.... but not getting too far as our fingers froze, we had to push through the pain as we rethawed them, and attempted as quickly as possible to just get the tent up and inside!!



With several breaks to quickly throw on another layer, or to further defrost our fingers, we finally had it up and attempted to get the snow off us to crawl inside. Not so easy as we sunk to our knees trying to walk through the non compacted snow to the door! Damn! We threw ourselves inside and quickly got ourselves changed. We were freezing!!! Just to give you an idea...! I was wearing a thermal singlet, a thermal long sleeve, a fleece thermal, a fleece vest, a thick fleece jacket, my snow jacket, a neck warmer, beanie, gloves, thermals, fleece pants and snow pants! I was definitely cosy now though!! :-)



We headed outside to check out Keith’s hut – built in memory of Keith Flavelle, who died in a mountaineering accident. I hadn’t noticed it as we came along the path as it was almost buried in slow! There was a steep set of stairs carved into the snow to go down and access the front door. Inside we found maybe 6 other backcountry skiers out for the weekend. It would fill up with approximately another 12 coming in later that day!



It was a great group of people, all friendly and thoughtful as we chatted and checked out the hut and surrounds. There was a ‘pee tree’ outside signposted where you peed!



Further along there was also an outhouse, but the stairs were a bit steep for me to want to do in the dark! It was really nice though, a bucket at the side for burning toilet paper so it didn’t fill up, and a door that didn’t close so you had a lovely view whilst doing your business of about a six foot snow bank in front of you and snow covered trees beyond that!



There were also snow seats outside the hut that someone had made as we all sat around and cooked our dinner outside enjoying the stunning scenery and peaks in front of us.



Views of Joffre Peak, Mount Matier and Vantage Peak can all be seen above the cabin. The Anniversary Glacier can be seen falling down towards the cabin between Joffre Peak and Mount Matier. From the pass between Mount Matier and Vantage Peak there are awesome views of Mount Hartzell, Mount Howard, Twin One Glacier and, in the distance to the south, Snowspider Mountain.



I soon discovered everything is much harder when in the snow!! Even just drinking! You can’t just pop to a creek and filter the water! It was quite the epic ordeal to even drink as you had to fill your pot with snow, wait for it to heat up and melt down to water (an overflowing pot of snow shrunk down to about an inch of water!!), refill it with snow, and repeat until the pot was full! It took some time to do!! Cool experience but definitely time and effort!!



It started to get chilly as the sun set and we enjoyed our pasta and Indian meals with a million dollar view before watching the first stars of the night emerge so brightly.

It was still so easy to see outside though as the snow was so bright with the reflection from the moon!



Heading indoors we checked out the hut, a fire being lit to keep us all warm – the wood had to be helicoptered in!!! How crazy is that! There was a large table and several benches for everyone to sit on, some comfy wooden chairs around the fire with a giant pot on top melting snow for more drinking water. Some built in shelves at the back served as shelves for the food, a bench for cooking inside, and hooks for everyone’s gear around the walls. There was a wooden ladder you climbed to get to the upstairs sleeping area. It was a great set up! The pipe from the wood burner went upstairs through the sleeping area too so nice to have a little extra warmth there!



Looking out the windows was amazing and different as well – as there was an overhand from the roof on the sides, there were icicles hanging down and the then snow bank with all its layers slightly further out – very pretty! Other windows on different sides were just covered entirely with snow!



It was so nice, people from everywhere just sitting around chatting, chilling out and enjoying themselves. There was a girl from Vancouver who worked in the same building as I – random! And she had also brought her little Chihuahua in a backpack! Crazy!

On advice from Hugh on how cold we would be, Jena and I had earlier quickly baggsed the last couple of sleeping spots in the upstairs sleeping area... and were soooo glad we did as the others outside in tents absolutely froze... and they were totally prepared with all the right gear!



It was super cosy in the hut and I surprisingly had an awesome nights sleep, considering the amount of people that were sleeping next to each other on the floor! We were woken up early by ski boots clunking on the floor downstairs and making the whole level wobble... so I guess it was then time to get up!



The day was so clear and gorgeous as I wandered around the hut before waiting for the snow to melt so I could have porridge for breakfast!



We packed up and headed outside to sit and enjoy the glorious sunshine and beautiful day as we watched some crazy crazy backcountry skiers climb up the peaks in front of us. There was one particular group who were literally going to the very very top of a peak in front of us – around these crazy rocks and ridge lines and literally moving horizontally it was so steep! We sat with binoculars and watched amazed at their (very slow though!) progress. There was one guy who was going vertical and literally crawling, lifting and digging in his horizontal snowboard and then pulling himself up, and repeating – over and over again for several hours to get to the top! After all our watching they ended up skiing down the back side of the peak so we could not watch their run, but we did see a few other groups climbing the glacier and then skiing down various runs which was really cool! The first group in particular though was just crazy!! They must really love what they do to do that!!!



We had long, thin plastic sleds, or crazy carpets as they are also known, and we had fun sliding down the slopes on them... it was exhausting climbing back up again though as we left the snowshoes behind so we weren’t clocked in the head by the crampons, and so therefore sunk knee deep in the snow on each footstep!!



Time went so fast though as it was soon time to leave our stunning location, do our final pack up and head out!!



Hugh, Shiela and Justin had skied out earlier and we were meeting them along the route, and so Jena, Michelle and I – the three Aussies who had never been in the alpine backcountry began our hike. But alas we did not get so far before the trails confused us!! Hmmm the path we were following went straight out into a massive gully that continued on down a valley and looked like a massive avalanche slide path! The worst thing was we were all so exhausted coming in we could not remember if we had come this way or not! ...And facing the opposite direction we had no idea! Putting in another quad workout we retraced our steps to ensure there was no other path, confirmed our trail, and half an hour later we were on our way again! We had a time to meet the rest of the group and were now running late, but better safe than sorry! Turned out we were on the right path – we just had to hug the trees and then turn into the tree line as the path dictated – but it just goes to show how easy it would be to get actually lost out here with nothing around for an eternity!!



The sun had been out in force so it was a totally different hike out with the slushy snow beneath our feet but just so beautiful again as we crunched through the forest and then to our meeting point to join the others at a beautiful open space with a panoramic of stunning snowy peaks in every direction we turned.



The hike had taken us maybe almost 4 hours on the way in, but probably less than three on the way out – certainly made a difference going down the hills and lighter packs with all we had eaten whilst we had been there!



It was such a beautiful hike out as we made the most of the gorgeous landscape before arriving back at the cars, (untouched by thieves, woohoo!) and de-layered for the drive home!



We were all slightly... okay very dehydrated, a little sun kissed, and noticing all kinds of delightful algae and tree bits in our water, but totally all part of the fun! So good! :-)



We met a friend, Rahul, in Whistler Creekside as we gobbled up some well earnt dinner at Dusty’s before the final push home and farewell to the stunning mountains and amazing weekend!!
 
Red Cross Volunteer Recognition Night, Vancouver, Canada

Centennial Celebrations... Six weeks into my new job! Vancouver, Canada

2012-04-21 to 2012-05-21


After only being at the company for just over a month, I was lucky enough to be taking part in the Centennial Celebrations on Saturday, April 21, 2012!

‘Across time zones, across borders, across cultures, the Flu*or family comes together. In recognition of Fl*or’s 100 year anniversary, we welcome you to be part of a once in a lifetime event to celebrate our history and our future - globally!, was the tag line as my flatmate Keiran and I dressed up in our best travelers formalwear headed down to the New Convention Centre at 2.45pm ready to start the festivities! I had not been into that area of the convention centre before and it was really beautiful–there was wooden paneling over all the walls and ceilings and giant matchstick eggs hanging from the ceiling…. Okay…It may not sound that good, but it looked amazing!

Over a thousand people were there in a massive conference room all decked out with a huge stage and dance floor at the front, decorated tables and the most amazing panoramic view of the snow capped North Shore Mountains at the back that became the twinkling lights of the North Shore as darkness descended.

We grabbed our champagne…or two…and joined our table to watch the presentations. There was a Global Simulcast event broadcast live via satellite around the world from Dallas, Texas and also viewings from Offices all around the world which was really neat as people in all different timezones came together, and, as they performed a roll call we saw them all flash up on the GIANT screen waving and could see how everyone was celebrating. There were events in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Manila, the Philippines; Greenville, South Carolina; Melbourne and Perth, Australia; Shanghai, China; New Delhi, India; Calgary, Canada; London, Great Britain; Johannesburg, South Africa and Santiago, Chile. And all simultaneously! So afternoon for us, evening for the east coast, and all hours of the day and night all around the world! So yep, people were literally at the event at 0330h in New Delhi, India and 0500h in Perth, Australia! And all slightly different, for example Melbourne was celebrating with a breakfast buffet at the zoo whilst others were in auditorium seating for a day screening and others were sitting around tables having dinner!

We watched a few really interesting and well put together videos on the history on Fl*or over the past hundred years, some of our projects around the world, and a work day of Fl*or employees all over the world. It definitely made me feel super lucky to be working within such a large global company with so much opportunity.

The Chief Executive Officer Dave Seaton began speaking of Flu*r’s legacy of achievements that have impacted the daily lives of millions of people around the world.

The celebration began as literally every single gathering of Flu*r employees begins–with an HSE (OH&amp;S) topic. The Senior Group President Steve Dobbs told how safety is the company’s foundation with the example of a project site in China decades ago, as personal protection equipment and boots were distributed to workers, he realized many of the workers had never worn any kind of shoe other than sandals. He spent that first morning showing 250 excited workers how to tie their new shoes.

We had quite a good speech on the Slide Ruler–the engineering staple tool, the announcement of 10 recipients of US$10,000 from the Flu*r Foundation, and videotaped segments from former Flu*r leaders…it seemed to be a common theme that you had to have a loud shirt! Everyone on the video had one; some were definitely super super cool too!

The Cirque du Soleil performance was amazing! There was the centre piece of two men performing all kinds of acrobatic moves using the other as a base…it is really hard to explain, but doing one handed handstands on the base guy’s head, then moving to another configuration, and most of it just done with the base support man standing, and the other doing all kinds of movements in a handstand, just holding hands/wrists! The pressure in their wrists and arms must have been crazy!! They also had support acts at the side with acrobats and a violin player performing on structures suspended from the ceiling which was quite cool.


There was also the debut of a specially-commissioned premiere performance of“Dawn of Destiny,”by child prodigy, conductor and composer, Alexander Prior, presented by Dallas Symphony Orchestra (http://www.alexprior.co.uk/ ). I was super impressed when I found out Alexander was only 19 years old!! And has already performed all around the world…crazy! Starting composing at the age of eight and has written more than 40 works, including symphonies, concertos, two ballets, two operas, and a Requiem. At 13, he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and at age 17, he graduated with Distinction two Masters-Degrees in Symphonic and Operatic Conducting, and in Composition from the St. Petersburg Conservatory. And has since already collaborated with many leading orchestras and ensembles.

So I was ready to be impressed! The symphony arrived, looking extremely professional as Alexander arrived in a t shirt and black jeans!! Hmm…the symphony started and we tried to follow…tried….! A guy at work the next day described it as‘a musical epileptic fit’. It was erratic and jumped everywhere, and so choppy we couldn’t keep track of where it was going! The performers looked confused at parts, as one was flashed up on the giant screen turning pages of the music forward and back, odd expressions on their faces!

There were constant construction images behind it as well which was certainly an odd contrast to a classical type piece! I had to laugh as well as a GIANT mallet was produced from the percussion section and used to pound the drum…just once. It was definitely really random! Pretty cool that there was a piece commissioned for us though!

Former U.S. Secretary of State and Retired Four-Star General Colin Powell started really well, with really interesting stories about his time working with Ronald Regan, the cold war, meetings with Michael Gorbachov, the emergence of other super powers in the world besides the USA, and then began on the pro USA! USA! We are number one!! Propaganda which kind of makes sense when you think about it as we are an American company and his direct audience he was talking to were based in Texas, but it was just kind of odd for the rest of us sitting around the rest of the world watching!

We were dying for some water at this stage, the champagne not really cutting it, several hours in as we exited from the auditorium to the terrace to find the Olympic flame on which was really beautiful on such a nice day, hors devours and cocktails!

Returning to the ballroom we were ready to celebrate the Vancouver section! We had a very short circus performance by the Underground Circus (http://www.undergroundcircus.ca/whowerae.html ) with people in giant balls that we kind of missed chatting outside! Before our MC–Local TV personality Dawn Chubai (http://www.dawnchubai.com/ ) arrived to begin proceedings! We had some speeches on Fl*or cares, our volunteer program, recognition of long serving employees and some speeches as the food arrived. Billed as‘a world class dinner by Executive Chef Blair Rasmussen’was also served…quite tasty! Well....except the Parmesan frico... whatever that is…we had to classily pick that up with our fingers as it was a thin, super hard melt of kind of stale parmesan gratings that were impossible to cut or eat any other way!
Starter - Mesclun-style salad of baby lettuce leaves, herbs and sprouts, Parmesan frico&amp;balsamic vinagrette
Main Course - Rosemary crusted free range chicken breast, fig balsamico demi glace
Mashed red potatoes with roasted garlic cream, garden vegetable trio
Dessert - Flourless chocolate Italiano cake, burnt orange sauce

There was another performance by the Underground Circus, with two silk aerial performers literally directly above our table which was quite cool, before the Famous Players Band (http://www.famousplayersband.com/index.html ) played some fantastic music and it was sooo awesome to see really quiet engineers who normally just sit at their desks on their computers out and dancing up a storm! Every single age group was out there on the floor, all dancing together so it was really super fun.

The lights turned on and it was time! The flower arrangements were being thrown out so I grabbed one to decorate our place, which turned out to be hilarious as thinking of no other reason for carrying around a floral arrangement, a colleague began telling people that Keiran and I had just been married. Hilarious, and possibly the ugliest wedding bouquet that looked like funeral flowers that ever existed, in a ridiculously heavy vase, definitely made for some entertaining stories!

It was definitely a super fun, amazing night and made me even more glad for the opportunity to be part of such an awesome company!

** Just in case you were wondering, I have changed my company name to include the‘*’as I don’t want my blog showing up when people search the internet!

EAT! Vancouver

2012-06-02

The food and cooking festival was happening just around the corner at BC place, so we had to head down and check it out! EAT! Vancouver (www.eat-vancouver.com ) We walked around trying all kinds of samples.... there was llama jerky (delicious! - coyote acres ranch - www.coyote-acres-ranch.ca), all kinds of different flavoured peanut butters (maple, cinnamon, white and dark chocolate, chilli, and all kinds! From the All Natural Peanut Butter co - www.ilovepeanutbutter.com ), the BEST honey ever!! Natural, cinnamon, a super delicious refreshing mint, and other kinds too! From Kidd Bros Honey (www.kbhoney.com / www.westernsagehoney.com ), and also Pollen!!! Yep, apparently it is a new super food.... but tastes exactly like sawdust or the smell of barn!!! GROSS!!!! A super super delicious maple mustard (Voisin&apos;s Maple Products (westcoast.maple@hotmail.ca ), birch syrup!! Yup, I didn&apos;t realise they made birch syrup! (Sweet Tree Ventures - www.sweettreeventures.com) And delicious cider, rice milks, greek yoghurts, edamame rice salad, coffee&apos;s, chocolates from all around the world, cheeses, dairy and lactose free cheeses, ciders (local Okanagan Valley &apos;Longtree&apos;, fruits, dips, salsa&apos;s, smoothies, smoked and candied salmon, and anything you can think of!



There was also a beer garden where you brought tickets and then exchanged them for a glass which you then went around and swapped tickets for glasses of beer or wine! It was really good value actually - one ticket, so 50c for a half glass or beer or $1 for a wine! I found a really nice wine actually on my first taster! A Sauvignon Blanc Forbidden Fruit Winery in the Similkameen Valley here in B.C (www.forbiddenfruitwines.com)! So good!



You could also use the tickets for little food taster plates as well! So good to try different things! But without a doubt salmon here is the most delicious ever!



There were celebrity chefs and stages and cooking demonstrations and barista championships and all kinds of things going on! Super fun!

A Salt Spring Getaway, Gulf Islands, B.C.

2012-06-29 to 2012-07-02

I had a friend Ahnah, who i had met at ashram in Quebec when i studied yoga last year, living as a karma yogi and working on the kitchen in the Salt Spring Island Centre.



I left home at 11am to begin the epic journey. Although located close by on one of the Gulf Islands, it was a skytrain, then bus to Tsawassen Ferry Terminal, a ferry over to Schwartz Bay, Victoria (on Vancouver Island), and then another much, much smaller car ferry over to Fulford Harbour on Salt Spring Island! Even nicer though Ahnah was there waiting to pick me up which was awesome! Very cool, and sooooo beautiful sailing through the gorgeous Gulf Islands, but a long Five hour journey by the time we arrived at the centre!



The centre, established in 1981 (www.saltspringcentre.com ) is spread across 70 acres of meadows, forest and organic gardens. The gardens surrounding grow all the food that is eaten at the centre, as well as beautiful bright flowers and peaceful waterfalls. The main house is so pretty - a heritage house with beautiful hardwood floors and a turret! So cool!



It was Gorgeous! So peaceful and relaxing! We walked through the centre campsite and out onto some of the amazing untouched forest trails that are part of the land, totally surrounded by all kinds of different amazing plants and a deer looking at us through the shrubs!



The Conch shell blows for meals and we all gathered for a communal om before starting the fresh delicious organic vegetarian food, the majority of which is farmed at the centre! And it was soo good! We had a tempeh shepherds pie with rice and broccoli and sweet potato, kale, fresh salad, homemade dressing, and fresh baked gluten free soda bread with seeds and grains!



And then a huge bowl of delicious fresh Strawberries picked from the gardens. Sooo delicious and unbelieveably tasty!!! Not like those supermarket ones that taste like water!



Everyone was so super lovely and friendly at the centre, and all so laid back and relaxed which was awesome. A mix of people of all ages and backgrounds, some couples, some single, all volunteering and generally mostly Trying to figure out what they wanted in their lives.



It was a lovely evening so a few of us walked out to Cusheon lake not too far away to sit on the dock on the peaceful water and relax for the evening. It was so beautiful! And we were the only people out there too!



As we walked along we also passed several deer along the sides of the road. So cool!



Luckily Ahnah had a spare mattress on her bed and was kind enough to let me crash on her floor, so it was totally awesome to be able to stay in the centre.



The next morning i headed to a Yoga pranayama and asana (breathing and postures) to start the day in a lovely wooden yurt (a traditional round building) whilst Ahnah worked.



We then feasted on a delicious breakfast with porridge and every topping you can think of - fresh strawberries, fresh fruit salad, natural yoghurt... possibly THE best yoghurt in the world!! sultanas, sunflower seeds, crushed almonds, all kinds of nut butters, tahini, sesame seeds, molasses, non dairy milks, granola! Just like my total favourite breakfast all together!! So good!



I then jumped in Ahnah&apos;s car and drove the one road into the islands town - Ganges. So nice to drive again! And the people were all super friendly! They smiled and waved as we passed each other on the street.



I drove into the cute little town with wide streets, flowers and trees, and old fashioned shopfronts. Even better, there was not a single fast food restaurant or chain in sight!



And located right on the water! It was stunning!!



The entire island had the same vibe also and it was amazing! Laid back, relaxed, and there was no rush. So awesome! I might stay here forever! :-)



I walked across the road into the famous Salt Spring Island markets and was definitely impressed! So many local businesses displaying all kinds of goods fresh fresh, local, organic produce to sheepskins, jewelry, lots of lovely handmade soaps, baked goods, clothes, chocolate, and you name it! And what stood out to me the most was Everything arranged so beautifully on all the stalls!! It looked amazing! Especially some of the cheeses! In both the markets and supermarkets, they had really pretty bright flowers, basil leaves, chilli or whatever was relevant in the base of their clear containers. It was really pretty! (www.saltspringcheese.com )



There was a Live band playing under the pagoda and everyone was in a great mood, tapping their feet as they listened along. It was so nice to see people of all ages out enjoying it all equally, from kids to grandparents!



I wandered around checking out all the cute little shops in town and the amazing location right on the water.



It was then time to head back to another delicious lunch at the centre with a vegetable ragout, polenta, fresh baked gluten free bread, beans, fresh salad and homemade dressing and all so delicious!!



Ahnah and i had a quick trip into town to pick up a few things and then we met a couple of others to drive out to Ruckle Park. We started out on one of the trails, hiking along the waterfront, and it was stunning! We had views out to other gulf islands around us and the path hugged the coast, bringing us into all sorts of super pretty little inlets!



As we stood on the point we looked about ten meters out in front if us to find a seal just swimming along! So cool!



We headed onto the inland trails to check out some if the local farms and came across cows, and sheep before cutting back to the road to head back to the car and coming across more sheep, and a turkey farm where there was no gate and they were free to wander as they pleased! There was one giant giant giant one as well.... Would have fed dozens of people! Mmm mm! :-)



There were a few cute little stalls by the side of the road with produce out and an honesty system where you just left money and so we ate some delicious ginger biscuits.



Heading home we had a picnic of leftovers on the tables outside in the garden and then checked out the bonfire Stacey, the maintenance guy was burning to get rid of all the yard waste.



The next morning Ahnah and I started with pranayamas to begin the day before another amazing breakfast... all my favourites combined again! :-)



Then it was straight out to Mt Erskine! We drove to the trailhead and entered the path to be surrounded by a beautiful forest. It started off as a steep hill, but so peaceful and beautiful as we made our way up, and pretty much the only people on the trail!



Several times along the way there were tiny, tiny (about 30cm high) Little doors placed onto several rocks which were super cute.... Like entrances to tiny homes for little elfin folks!! :-) people had then placed coins or little trinkets around them do they had become mini shrines!



As we arrived at the summit, we were greeted with Stunning views over to several of the gulf islands out to Vancouver Island and the ability to see so far you could almost see the curve of the earth on the horizon! It was so stunning with the gorgeous blue sky, crisp white clouds, bright green trees in the other islands and then the clean blue water!!! So beautiful!!



Again we pretty much had the trail to ourselves as we walked down through the gorgeous forest and then Home to a delicious lunch with curry tofu, beet salad, amazing maple balsamic dressing for fresh salad, potato soup, and some new things I will add to my diet - mahaogony rice and tamari sunflower seeds! Mmm mm!



We had a big Satsung (evening chanting and meditation) in the giant room filled with windows and about 8 people at the front with all kinds of instruments - drum, flute, harmonium, guitars and violin as well as others with the mini cymbals and someone blowing the conch shell!



There was quite a big turn out from lots of people in the community coming out to join in the chanting which was a really fun two hours, before a big community dinner where we had a giant miso veg and bean soup, blanched greens, bean salad and fresh salad, and the most delicious vegan spelt bread with lavender, rosemary and lemon basil that I have ever had!! Made fresh by Ahnah that afternoon!!! Delicious!!



Angie, Ahnah and I headed up to Mount Maxwell, the highest point on the island to gaze at the gorgeous views of the island, ocean and out to the surrounding islands, as well as the amazing almost full moon. We had planned to stay for sunset but we could not even stay still it was so cold! In summer! And rugged up in winter jackets! Ridiculous!! We walked the perimeter path before heading down into town to join in the Canada Day festivities.



We attempted to find the infamous island lavender gelato at Harlens (www.harlanschocolates.com), but unfortunately they again did not have it today! But for future reference we found out you can preorder it!! Lavender and lime is apparently a winner! Awesome!! :-) They do have the equally as famous salted caramel, but a little too sweet for me!



We got a table and had a drink at Ganges harbour as we awaited the fireworks. And it turned out to be brilliant positioning as they went off in the harbour directly in front of us!



And they were really cool! But it was still so Unbelieveably cold!!! July, mid summer and we were all in winter jackets and still freezing! Ridiculous! Straight hometown jump into warm beds! Brr!



After another super delicious breakfast it was time to say goodbye as Ahnah dropped me at the long harbour ferry. This is a smaller ferry but just visits the smaller gulf islands, and not Vancouver Island so is much nicer and less hectic - especially on a public holiday! And only $9.20 for the trip!!! Crazy!!! A three hour trip with a 45 min stopover and ferry change in village bay, Mayne island and galliano. And so much nicer weaving so close to and in and out of all the little gulf islands!



What a great long weekend! Back to city life super relaxed and chilled out!
 
The psychics refused to &apos;read&apos; me! Granville island, Vancouver

2012-07-07

My friends Ahnah and Angie (who I stayed with last weekend) visited from Salt Spring island and we took an awesome road trip up to the coolest camp site on the Squamish Valley River! I&apos;ll post some pics soon!



We then headed into Granville Island to check out the psychics! I have never been interested, and never been to one, but thought &apos;why not?!&apos; We went into two places and then chose one. But then the first psychic chose not see me, and then the second one refused to do a reading on me! She mixed up pall her tarot cards, had the wrong pack int eh wrong space, dealt out the cards wrong and kept staring at me weirdly and then told me the energy wasn&apos;t right and I should leave!! I was like really?! Weird!!! But I guess I will never know why! :-) They had both done readings on my friends and were quite accurate so very interesting!
