Wrong place wrong time scenario
 Ok guys and gals another scenario to work out.

You are in your local fast food restaurant. You have finished eating and take your child into the bathroom. The bathroom is at the end of a long hallway. The ladies room door is at the end of the hall with the mens room to the left. Your wife/SO/family members remain at the table.

The restaurant is set up with two main areas at the entrance to the hallway is the lobby/waiting area where the cash register is located and past that is the seating area where your family is.

The bathroom is a single stall with a lock on the entrance to the bathroom door and it is only you and your family member in the bathroom. While washing your hands you hear screaming and a single gunshot from the lobby. You can make out at least two men shouting orders. You are armed with your EDC no matter what it is and mags or speedloaders to go with it.

Now what? How do you exit? Do you exit? There is about 15 feet from the bathroom door to the lobby area. The lobby area is 20 feet across and the dining area is also 20 feet across. Your family members are seated at the far end.

Same as before please no responses of I&apos;m not married or I just wouldnt eat there or I dont have kids. Feel free to replace wives, kids or relatives as needed but the family member with you in the bathroom due to age or medical condition needed your assistance.

 Take a moment to think before you speak and speak before you act it is a reflection of us all.

How old is the child with you? I he/she old enough to stay locked in the restroom while you investigate?

 Why 1911? Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  09:28 AM #3 retsupt99 Moderator Join Date Jul 2006 Location Central Florida Posts 36,017 Get on the phone right now, call 911 and report (what sounds like) a robbery in progress. You have no idea of how many dirtbags or where they are standing. You&apos;re not a cop and your appearance could just cause shooting to start. If I had my grandkids along (they&apos;d both be in the bathroom with me or the wife), they are way to young to lock alone in the bathroom...they would be crying, and that could draw attention.
If, and just if, I had to go into the main area, I might just drape a coat over my gun already in my hand...sort of a surprise.

&quot;Give this to, uh, Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren&apos;t going to be carried away. After all we&apos;re not murderers in spite of what this undertaker thinks.&quot;

Distinctive double taps, wife is shooting and I&apos;m definitely staying put. This is something we have discussed and agreed upon, one of us must survive to raise our children.

 Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  09:59 AM #6 Tye_Defender Member Join Date Mar 2007 Location Arkansas Posts 233 Tough situation. What I have learned recently is I don&apos;t know what I would do until the situation was going on. (I don&apos;t think anyone really knows what they would do until it happens).

However, what I think I would do is stay in the bathroom with my kid. I know I can protect my kid in the bathroom, but I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in front. I would call 911 right away and tell them what I have heard and where I am and then stay put unless something else starts happening.

There has already been one shot, so they are either willing to shoot without a second thought or they are jumpy. Either way, my coming out of the bathroom is very likely to cause another shot. My wife or one of my other kids may or may not have been shot with the first shot, but there is nothing I can do about that so I have to just stay where I am. Hopefully that was the only shot that would be fired and the scumbags leave with what they were after.

I&apos;d stay on the phone with 911 so I&apos;d no when the police arrive and if I hear more gunshots then I would probably leave the bathroom and try to help.

That being said, if anyone was hurt after the first shot was fired I would probably second-guess myself for the rest of my life.

 Sometimes in life you have to stand your ground. It&apos;s a hard lesson to learn and even most adults don&apos;t get it, but in the end only I can be responsible for my life. If faced with any type of adversity, only I can overcome it. Waiting for someone else to take responsibility is a long fruitless wait. Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  11:31 AM #9 Jcabin Member Join Date Dec 2008 Location Greatest State in The Union, Pennsylvania Posts 414 My daughter is 14 months old. I love her mother but my priority is dictated by the circumstances. I would have to protect my baby first and foremost. That either means calling 911 and notifying them what is happening, and that I am armed, and what I look like, and that the armed men have my wife detained against her will, or taking the baby and heading out of the building and moving the baby to safety, off the scene.

If my child was older and could survive on her own, it might be different. Then again, it depends on alot of factors.

Ultimately this is why we have family SOP&apos;s. The wife ALWAYS carries the baby, and I am always armed. The protector can&apos;t be holding onto an infant/child while performing his duties. Last edited by Jcabin; July 13th, 2010 at 01:01 PM .

This leaves the most capable/prepared protector in the most advantageous position to take care of business. He can either engage while the wife and baby take cover or he can choose to move with them to cover and protect them on the way. Good stuff Jcabin. Plans may not always go as planned, but they do help.

Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  12:53 PM #11 BikerRN Ex Member Join Date Jan 2007 Location State of Discombobulation Posts 5,256 Survival of the child is paramount. 

Nothing else matters. Place child against wall, to the side of the door opposite of the way the door opens, shielded by your body, gun out, 911 on phone giving location and&quot;shots fired&quot;and that I&apos;m armed and will shoot anyone coming through the door that doesn&apos;t identify themselves. If door opens without someone identifying who they are, shoot.

I will kill, murder and do any other act needed to ensure the safety and survival of those I love, but the wife is on her own in this scenario. The child comes first and is the only concern, no matter the age. I hope it doesn&apos;t come to the murdering, and in this scenario it doesn&apos;t have to. Justified Deadly Force can be used here as gunshots would lead one to have a reasonable expectation that death or grave bodily injury is imminent.

 Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  01:59 PM #13 Tom G VIP Member Join Date Nov 2006 Location Central Florida Posts 2,375 First thing to do is call 911 on your cell phone. I would let the LEOs handle it unless the BG start abusing or shooting at my family or others. I would tell my kid to get on the floor of the restroom and stay there until I come for him. I would get as close to the BGs as possible and try take them out.

 Reply With Quote July 13th, 2010  02:26 PM #15 Guantes VIP Member Join Date May 2010 Location Idaho Posts 5,272 To fit the parameters and modifications allowed in the OP, it would most likely be me, my grandkids and their dad.

Hearing one shot may be a victim shot, or may have been a warning shot in the ceiling or such. I would stay in the bathroom with the grandchild, unless I heard further shooting. Their dad, who has similar training and experience to grandpa, would be responsible for the safety of the other grandchildren and would not initiate action unless deemed absolutely necessary.

I would not call 911.
I prefer that they (robbers) have the opportunity to leave rather than possibly be boxed into a shootout/hostage situation.
I prefer dealing with the situation, if necessary, with someone of known capabilities, that I know.

If I hear further shooting, it is most likely that&quot;dad&quot;has necessarily engaged. I would leave the grandchild in the bathroom with instructions to wait for dad or grandpa to come and get them, because at this point the other grandchildren are in greater jeopardy. Then I would move to assist dad.
