		Straight Dope Message Board &gt; Main &gt; The BBQ Pit &gt;The Ten Commandments of Drive-Thru Etiquette PDA 
View Full Version : The Ten Commandments of Drive-Thru Etiquette 
 Smapti 08-11-2005, 11:51 AM Having worked far too long in the food service industry, i&apos;ve seen my share of people who seem to have absolutely no idea how drive-thru restaurants work. I&apos;ve suffered no end of heartache and aggravation from people who can&apos;t seem to grasp what should be blatantly obvious, and i&apos;ve finally come to the conclusion that what the world needs is a simple guide to the thou shalts and thou shalt nots of the process. So here it is - a guide to the uninformed and a pitting of the clueless.

1) An there beith a preview board, thou shalt use it. Many drive-thrus now have two separate menu boards - one with the attached speaker, and a second menu one car-length behind the speaker. This is known as a&quot;preview board&quot;because the customer can look it over before advancing to the speaker and starting the restaurant&apos;s speed-of-service timer. If you don&apos;t know what you want, USE this board. Don&apos;t drive past it straight to the speaker, ask the clerk to&quot;gimme a second&quot;, and then spend two or three minutes staring at it while the speed-of-service time gets higher and higher.

2)Thou shalt not shout&quot;Hello?&quot;or honk thy horn if there is a delay at the speaker. Just because the clerk isn&apos;t ready to take your order the second you pull up doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ve taken off their headset, clocked out, and gone home. Shouting&quot;Hello?&quot;or honking your horn will not make whatever the clerk is working on go away and it WON&apos;T get your order taken any faster - it only aggravates the clerk and potentially deafen them when they get a 110-decibal blast in the speaker strapped directly onto their ear.

3) Thou shalt not ask the clerk questions that could be answered by reading the menu. How much does the chicken sandwich cost? What comes on the TripleMax Superburger Deluxe? This is what the menu is FOR. It&apos;s the big thing right in front of you with all the words and numbers on it, not to mention the great big pictures where each item has been carefully posed to display each of its ingredients in larger-than-life detail. Use it.

4) Thou shalt NOT add to thy order at the window. Doing this requires the clerk to go back in and change your order (which at many restaurants requires a manager&apos;s approval to void part or all of the order), delays us getting your order out while we make whatever you decided you just couldn&apos;t live without during the lengthy 20&apos; drive from the speaker to the window, and delays everyone behind you getting what they want as well. Just don&apos;t do it.

5) If there is a line at the window, thou shalt start counting thy money before reaching it. We tell you what your total is at the speaker. Most restaurants also have video screens that show your total in big numbers. There is no reason for you to not know your total before you leave the speaker. If there&apos;s a car ahead of you at the window, there is no reason for you not to start counting out your money before you get there. Reaching the window after a three-minute wait and THEN deciding to start counting out the $37 in nickels you intend to pay me with is just lazy.

6) Thou shalt use actual numbers when ordering a quantity greater than one. I don&apos;t know how many&quot;a couple&quot;,&quot;a bunch&quot;,&quot;a lot&quot;, or&quot;a shitload&quot;of hamburgers is. I never learned those numbers in kindergarten. If you ask me for such a quantity, I will ask you to be more specific. The same goes for sauces. Our default is to give you one package of sauce for each item that requires it. If you ask me for a specific larger number I will give you that many, but if you ask me for&quot;a bunch&quot;or&quot;a lot&quot;I will give you two packages for each item. If you ask me for&quot;a shitload&quot;I may ask you not to come back to my store.

7) Thou shalt NOT use curse words into the drive-thru speaker. This one follows from the Sixth Commandment. The speaker you&apos;re talking into is connected to a loudspeaker which is audible to everyone in the kitchen and, often, to everyone in the lobby as well. This is a family business and more often than not there are children dining in our lobby. It is not appropriate for you to pull up to my speaker and start using profanity towards me, let alone my staff and customers. An idle slip of the tongue may be excused, but do it again and you&apos;ll be asked to leave.

8) Thou shalt not order another restaurant&apos;s menu items from us. We don&apos;t sell Big Macs here. We don&apos;t sell Whoppers here. We don&apos;t sell McChickens, Biggie Fries, Frosties, Grillburgers, McFlurries, McNuggets, Chicken Fries, Crossainwiches, McMuffins, McGriddles, or anything else that starts with&quot;Mc&quot;for that matter. You cannot Super-Size, King Size, or Biggie-Size our combos. We carry Coke, not Pepsi. We can&apos;t give you fry sauce, onion ring sauce, or Horsey sauce. Corellary: Thou shalt not order the item we carried for about a month two years ago and act shocked that we can&apos;t make it for you. We don&apos;t even carry the ingredients for that anymore. No, not even if you ask nicely.

9) Thou shalt make sure you have cash or a credit card BEFORE thou order. Think hard for just a second, buddy - have you EVER heard of a drive-thru restaurant taking checks? I didn&apos;t think so. Make sure you have the ability to pay for your order BEFORE you order it. Pulling up to the window and then&quot;discovering&quot;that you forgot your wallet won&apos;t earn you any sympathy from those of us who just busted our asses to make your order and now have to throw it all out. And no, it WON&apos;T get you any free food, either.

10) Thou shalt not, not, NOT, EVER, ask the clerk to&quot;hook you up&quot;. This is a business, not a charity. You want free food? Go to the food bank downtown. We&apos;re in business to make money, not feed your broke ass. I don&apos;t even know you. Why would I risk my job by giving away free food to a complete stranger? No, not if you give me a puff off your peace pipe. No, not if your girlfriend shows me her tits (and what kind of girl flashes a complete stranger for a 99-cent sandwich anyway?) No, not if you&apos;re really good buddies with the manager or the area coach or Sally in Accounting, because right here and right now I AM the manager and i&apos;ve never seen you before in my life.

Unbelievers, repent your sins and be saved. Anybody else got any commandments they&apos;d like to throw in before I break out the chisel? lno 08-11-2005, 11:57 AM 9) Thou shalt make sure you have cash or a credit card BEFORE thou order. Think hard for just a second, buddy - have you EVER heard of a drive-thru restaurant taking checks? I didn&apos;t think so.I am an acolyte of the drive-thru window, having spent two summers doing that many years ago. I wish to offer a mild correction to this above -- in Minneapolis, some drive-thru restaurants still do take checks, and those that ceased, only ceased a few short years ago.Anybody else got any commandments they&apos;d like to throw in before I break out the chisel?I would add:

11) Don&apos;t walk up to the drive-thru window. The sign claims it&apos;s for your safety, but it&apos;s for mine. If you&apos;re in your car, ideally wrapped snugly in a seat belt, you can&apos;t reach through the window to get to the register, food, or me. I like it that way. You stay in your car no matter how important you think you are. This goes double if bars have just closed and you&apos;re stumbling around drunk. Get outta the drive-thru lane. Left Hand of Dorkness 08-11-2005, 12:09 PM 2)Thou shalt not shout&quot;Hello?&quot;or honk thy horn if there is a delay at the speaker. Just because the clerk isn&apos;t ready to take your order the second you pull up doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ve taken off their headset, clocked out, and gone home. Shouting&quot;Hello?&quot;or honking your horn will not make whatever the clerk is working on go away and it WON&apos;T get your order taken any faster - it only aggravates the clerk and potentially deafen them when they get a 110-decibal blast in the speaker strapped directly onto their ear.
Can&apos;t agree with you there. It&apos;s the restaurant&apos;s job to make sure that the customer is acknowledged right away. If the restaurant wants to make this be via an automated voice, fine; but if I am a customer and I drive up to the speaker and nothing happens, I have no way of knowing whether the speaker is broken, whether the employees are all smoking hash down in the deep freezer, or whether the employee is a split-second away from answering the speaker.

I don&apos;t honk, but I don&apos;t blame those who do. It&apos;s the restaurant&apos;s obligation to reassure the customer, not the customer&apos;s obligation to hope that the technology is working.

3) Thou shalt not ask the clerk questions that could be answered by reading the menu. How much does the chicken sandwich cost? What comes on the TripleMax Superburger Deluxe? This is what the menu is FOR. [/quote]
You know the menu backwards and forwards, right? I, the customer, do not. It&apos;s a more efficient use of my time to ask questions if I&apos;m having trouble finding the answers on the often bizarrely-laid-out menu.

Of course, if your restaurant orders the menu in alphabetical order, then never mind; but I&apos;ve never seen that.

6) Thou shalt use actual numbers when ordering a quantity greater than one. I don&apos;t know how many&quot;a couple&quot;,&quot;a bunch&quot;,&quot;a lot&quot;, or&quot;a shitload&quot;of hamburgers is. I never learned those numbers in kindergarten. If you ask me for such a quantity, I will ask you to be more specific. The same goes for sauces. Our default is to give you one package of sauce for each item that requires it. If you ask me for a specific larger number I will give you that many, but if you ask me for&quot;a bunch&quot;or&quot;a lot&quot;I will give you two packages for each item.
That&apos;s kinda dumb of you, I think. If I ask for a lot of ketchup, you either need to give me far more than I could want (e.g., a dozen packets per order of fries), OR, preferably, you need to say,&quot;Will 6 packets be enough?&quot;Instead of making a deliberately stingy guess as to what I need, you ought to be asking the questions you need to ask so as to get the order right.

Yes, questions and clarifications are allowed via the speaker. See item 3.

8) Thou shalt not order another restaurant&apos;s menu items from us.
Once more, you&apos;re the expert at fast food. I&apos;m an expert at database design. I don&apos;t expect you to know about normalizing data, and you ought not expect me to be an expert on what crappy names your restaurant applies to your crappy food. If I get the name wrong--if I order Pepsi instead of Coke--you need to ask,&quot;Is Coke okay?&quot;If I order a Big Mac instead of a Whopper, you need to ask,&quot;Is a Whopper okay?&quot;It&apos;s your job to be the expert here. That&apos;s why you make the big bucks.

Otherwise, I agree :).

Daniel Smapti 08-11-2005, 12:17 PM Can&apos;t agree with you there. It&apos;s the restaurant&apos;s job to make sure that the customer is acknowledged right away. If the restaurant wants to make this be via an automated voice, fine; but if I am a customer and I drive up to the speaker and nothing happens, I have no way of knowing whether the speaker is broken, whether the employees are all smoking hash down in the deep freezer, or whether the employee is a split-second away from answering the speaker.

Perhaps some clarification is in order on this point. I&apos;m not talking about failing to get a greeting - if you pull up to the speaker and nobody says hello, that&apos;s our fault, not yours. However, the clerk is not always ready to take an order when they greet you - they may be talking to a customer at the window, dropping fryer items because the restaurant is short-staffed that day, or doing something else that prevents them from ringing you up at that immediate second, in which case the standard greeting is&quot;Welcome, I will be with you in just a moment&quot;. What i&apos;m talking about is the people for whom this just isn&apos;t good enough, who feel obligated to start shouting or honking their horn if they don&apos;t hear a human voice every five seconds to assure them that the restaurant hasn&apos;t closed and the staff gone home in the time they were wondering whether a Bacon SuperBurger Deluxe with Cheesy Fries would be OK for their diet as long as they had a Diet Coke for the drink. THAT&apos;S what the Second Commandment is targeted at. Fionn 08-11-2005, 12:17 PM 3) Thou shalt not ask the clerk questions that could be answered by reading the menu. How much does the chicken sandwich cost? What comes on the TripleMax Superburger Deluxe?

I agree with all of your commandments, but I would bet that some people who ask these questions either can&apos;t read or can&apos;t read well. When I worked at a record store, we had a few regular customers who always asked us to read track listings for them. One of my coworkers had an uncle who was a lifelong illiterate, and she noticed some patterns that suggested these customers weren&apos;t really forgetting their glasses. Duck Duck Goose 08-11-2005, 12:19 PM Walgreens driveup mini-rant here:

(12) Don&apos;t continue to talk on the fucking CELL phone while I&apos;m attempting to find out what it is you WANT from us. Tell Betty or Bobby or Biddy to fucking HOLD while you tell me what it is you WANT.

And DON&apos;T keep yakking to them while you&apos;re simultaneously talking to ME, &apos;kay, Brenda? Life would be so much simpler, for Betty and Bobby and Biddy, too, if we didn&apos;t all have to cope with conversations that go,&quot;Hi, can I help you?/Just a minute/No, not you, I&apos;m at the Walgreens driveup/Just a minute/Can I get this refilled?/You don&apos;t have any more refills on this, we&apos;ll have to call the doctor/Just a minute/How can it not have any more refills?/No, not you, I&apos;m still at Walgreens/Just a minute&quot;...

My favorite is the lady who flips open her phone and initiates a conversation while I&apos;m getting her change. You cannot wait even 20 more seconds before you just gotta talk to Betty? And what&apos;s so important to tell her?&quot;Hi!....Well, I&apos;m at the Walgreens driveup...&quot;If you waited another 20 seconds, you could tell her,&quot;Hi!...I&apos;m driving away from the Walgreens driveup...&quot;And if you waited another 20 seconds, you could tell her,&quot;Hi! I&apos;m in front of Panera Bread...&quot;


And as long as I&apos;m here:

(13) Try to understand that Walgreens is not McDonalds. It takes us about 20 minutes to process your prescription, and that&apos;s when we&apos;re not busy--we don&apos;t keep your Prozac or Lipitor made up ahead of time in 30-pill batches like Big Macs. You come inside, it takes 20 minutes, you come through the driveup, it still takes 20 minutes. And no, you can&apos;t just sit there and wait, because there are other PEOPLE behind you--hello? And when I get back on the mike and ask you to pull around, don&apos;t glare at me because you hadda roll your window down and I interrupted your phone conversation with Betty or Bobby or Biddy.

(14) Thou shalt not honk thy horn 10 seconds after thou drivest up. I KNOW you&apos;re there, Fred, I can SEE you through the large industrial-size plate glass window, &apos;kay? You can see me, I can see you, but I&apos;m BUSY, Fred, &apos;kay? I&apos;m busy waiting on OTHER customers (see the way I&apos;m handing them pills and stuff? That&apos;s how you can tell I&apos;m waiting on them), and I&apos;ll be with ya in a minute, trust me. Left Hand of Dorkness 08-11-2005, 12:19 PM What i&apos;m talking about is the people for whom this just isn&apos;t good enough, who feel obligated to start shouting or honking their horn if they don&apos;t hear a human voice every five seconds to assure them that the restaurant hasn&apos;t closed and the staff gone home in the time they were wondering whether a Bacon SuperBurger Deluxe with Cheesy Fries would be OK for their diet as long as they had a Diet Coke for the drink. THAT&apos;S what the Second Commandment is targeted at.
Ah, okay then, the commandment is just and proper. Sorry about that!

Daniel dwc1970 08-11-2005, 12:27 PM #12 Thou shalt always informeth cashier of coupons and other discounts before pulling up to the window.

One of my greatest pet peeves of all from my fast food days was when customers would present coupons or inform me that they are senior citizens and are thus entitled to a 10% discount. In these cases the old ticket had to be voided out and re-entered, driving up speed-of-service times.

This also goes for dine-in customers as it still delays our work and keeps the people in line behind you waiting even longer.

#13. Thou shalt turneth off thy cell phone!

Please, either tell the other person to hold on for a moment if you are already on a call, or just don&apos;t take the call while you give the cashier money and receive your order. It&apos;s very rude and inconsiderate to prattle on while the cashier has to wait for you to finish your conversation. The cashier may need to ask you questions. When I worked in fast food the year was 1994. Cell phones were just starting to become more commonplace, but not nearly as common as they are now, so I can only imagine how much worse the problem is today. Madd Maxx 08-11-2005, 12:32 PM You work at Taco Bell don&apos;t you? I mean, you&apos;re obviously open late because of the remark about the bars closing. And you don&apos;t mention anything about tacos, burritos, or hot sauces. Seriously, you&apos;ve had women flash you to get free drive through? Dudes have offered you drugs in lieu of payment? Got to be Taco Hell. Sampiro 08-11-2005, 12:33 PM I&apos;ve never worked in fast food but I&apos;ve eaten at enough to have the gut to show for it (lawsuit pending), so may I please add

If thou hast an unusual order, one that is far larger than normal (as in for an entire football team), or yea is even just more complicated than normal [cut the burger in half with mustard on the left side and mayonaisse on the right and a pickle on top of the bun] or requires several different payors, PLEASE go inside.

Fast food in general is for people who don&apos;t have time to spend 30 minutes waiting for their food. The Drive Thru is for people who have even less time. It drives me nuts when I get behind some totally unconcerned nimrod who thinks nothing of ordering 30 hamburgers (for thirty-two different payers) and taking 20 minutes at the window while traffic backs up into the next county.

Of course I also don&apos;t understand people who when they can see there are two-dozed queued cars at the drive thru and maybe three cars in the parking lot can&apos;t figure out it&apos;ll be quicker to go inside.


Do people really ask you for free food? Stringer 08-11-2005, 12:35 PM 1) An there beith a preview board, thou shalt use it. Many drive-thrus now have two separate menu boards - one with the attached speaker, and a second menu one car-length behind the speaker. This is known as a&quot;preview board&quot;because the customer can look it over before advancing to the speaker and starting the restaurant&apos;s speed-of-service timer. If you don&apos;t know what you want, USE this board. Don&apos;t drive past it straight to the speaker, ask the clerk to&quot;gimme a second&quot;, and then spend two or three minutes staring at it while the speed-of-service time gets higher and higher.


I don&apos;t like parking at the preview menu so cars get backed up behind me while I decide. I don&apos;t eat fast food often enough to know exactly what I want, and drive-thru menus are usually confusing. Frankly, your speed-of-service time is not my concern. JThunder 08-11-2005, 12:45 PM I don&apos;t like parking at the preview menu so cars get backed up behind me while I decide.
Well then, they&apos;ll get backed up behind you as you&apos;re placing your order. Ignoring the preview window doesn&apos;t save time at all.

I don&apos;t eat fast food often enough to know exactly what I want, and drive-thru menus are usually confusing.
Then go inside if you want to avoid the drive through menu.

Frankly, your speed-of-service time is not my concern.
It should be, especially when other customers are waiting. Ike Witt 08-11-2005, 12:45 PM 2)Thou shalt not shout&quot;Hello?&quot;or honk thy horn if there is a delay at the speaker. Just because the clerk isn&apos;t ready to take your order the second you pull up doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ve taken off their headset, clocked out, and gone home.

Thou shall not expect my business if there are no cars in front of me and no cars parked in the lot and I am told to&quot;wait a minute&quot;by the person on the other end of the speaker. Smapti 08-11-2005, 12:50 PM You work at Taco Bell don&apos;t you? I mean, you&apos;re obviously open late because of the remark about the bars closing. And you don&apos;t mention anything about tacos, burritos, or hot sauces. Seriously, you&apos;ve had women flash you to get free drive through? Dudes have offered you drugs in lieu of payment? Got to be Taco Hell.

No, it&apos;s not Taco Bell, but we are open 24 hours and we do get our fair share of people who stumble into their car after last call and decide that we&apos;ve got just what they need. More often than not they&apos;ve spent everything they had at the bar, which precipitates the kind of&quot;bargaining sessions&quot;you just mentioned. Dante 08-11-2005, 12:53 PM I don&apos;t like parking at the preview menu so cars get backed up behind me while I decide. I don&apos;t eat fast food often enough to know exactly what I want, and drive-thru menus are usually confusing. Frankly, your speed-of-service time is not my concern.So you park at the speaker and let cars back up behind you? Same twit, different pile.

Perhaps the drive-thru is not so much for you, yes? You go inside. Happy Scrappy Hero Pup 08-11-2005, 12:54 PM Once more, you&apos;re the expert at fast food. I&apos;m an expert at database design. I don&apos;t expect you to know about normalizing data, and you ought not expect me to be an expert on what crappy names your restaurant applies to your crappy food.

That&apos;s why you make the big bucks.

You&apos;re... you&apos;re... KIDDING... right?


There&apos;s a two-story-high MENU right there. On this menu are listed the names and costs of the products offered.


How can you be so good at database design when you can&apos;t even read? Stringer 08-11-2005, 12:56 PM So you park at the speaker and let cars back up behind you? Same twit, different pile.

Perhaps the drive-thru is not so much for you, yes? You go inside.

Uh, at least then both of us can read the menus. I&apos;ll gladly read the preview menu if there is a car ahead of me. Uvula Donor 08-11-2005, 01:01 PM I don&apos;t like parking at the preview menu so cars get backed up behind me while I decide.

Spoons 08-11-2005, 01:07 PM If there is a line at the window, thou shalt start counting thy money before reaching it....Not exactly the same thing (my comment is more for when there is no line of cars), but here it is anyway. If nobody is ahead of me in the drive-thru lane, the order-taker usually tells me to drive up to the window after placing my order at the speaker. There I stop, put the transmission in Park, undo my seat belt, take my feet off the pedals so I can roll my hips around to get my wallet from my back pocket, then pull a bill out to pay for my meal. All the while, it seems, the clerk at the window is rolling her eyes, with her hand out, with the attitude of&quot;I&apos;m waiting, Bozo. Hurry it up, willya?&quot;

Gee, I&apos;m sorry kid. I haven&apos;t yet had the chance to get my money (no line of cars, thus no stop-and-wait and subsequent chance to do this before getting to the window), but I&apos;ll yell you what: next time, I&apos;ll make damn sure that I take care of this before I get to your window. Y&apos;know, like when I&apos;m driving down the freeway. I can certainly see that it would make your life so much easier if I drove my car while squirming around in my seat, taking my eyes off the road, and rooting around in my wallet. :rolleyes:

Note that I am not accusing the OP and his or her co-workers of this attitude, but as long as we&apos;re doing little drive-thru rants here, I thought I&apos;d add it. I think a little patience and understanding on both sides would go a long way. Thankfully, I seem to have complied with most of the OP&apos;s commandments; I&apos;ll be careful in future with the rest.

I also have to ask, though: what&apos;s with the speakers that sound as if they came secondhand from a closed-out drive-in movie? Not all fast-food drive-thrus have these--some places have really good quality speakers, actually--but some are crackly, staticky, and hard to hear. Anybody else find this? Robot Arm 08-11-2005, 01:08 PM I don&apos;t like parking at the preview menu so cars get backed up behind me while I decide.

Well then, they&apos;ll get backed up behind you as you&apos;re placing your order. If I pull up to the regular menu, then someone behind me can be reading the preview boards and figuring out what they want. I get served at the same time I would have anyway, the person behind me gets out sooner, and if your stats are adversely affected, then the stats are wrong. Dante 08-11-2005, 01:11 PM Uh, at least then both of us can read the menus. I&apos;ll gladly read the preview menu if there is a car ahead of me.
S&apos;good point.

Now I&apos;m torn between your right to use the drive-thru and your inability to order quickly, which is why everyone else is using the drive-thru. Hmmm, it&apos;s a dilemma.

You are there to provide a service for which the customer pays.

For fuck sake I get so tired of grumpy whiney customer service people that can&apos;t be bothered to smile or say hello. They just sullenly hold out there hand for us to meekly place our money in it like they are doing us a favor.

Fine the job sucks, they do not pay you enough, the CUSTOMERs are dumb asses. Thats the incentive to get a better job. But for cryin out loud try to do the one you have well.

Since we are talking about commandments, how about:

Don&apos;t fuck up my order and put in a Whopper when I ordered a Chicken Sandwich (That I will not discover untill I am 5 miles down the road.

nope. sorry. Everytime I&apos;ve done that, I&apos;ve ended up spending more of your time &apos;cause I drop it. I drive a stick shift, and can&apos;t hold onto $4.38 while simultaneously driving and shifting. and if I put it on the seat next to me, it alwasy goes in between the seat cushions. I&apos;ve learned the hard way, to wait til I&apos;m at the window with the person waiting for the money before I start counting it out. (unless I&apos;m simply paying with dollar bills). but change? nope.

meanwhile, you&apos;re holding out my drink/straws whatever while I&apos;m still fiddling with the change you just gave me? what the fuck gives with that program? biscuitsandgravy 08-11-2005, 01:32 PM I have to agree that your speed of service times are not my problem. I&apos;ve done my time in fast food. You&apos;re saying, if there are no cars in the line, stop at the preview board, then roll up to the actual window and make my order, right? (Because if someone was ahead of me I would, by default, spend time looking at the preview board, which is what its actual purpose is.) That cuts the time my order is listed on your automated system (since I&apos;m not going,&quot;two burgers, extra cheese, um, gimme a second - anybody want fries? - three large fries&quot;), which makes your manager happy, right? But I don&apos;t care about your manager&apos;s happiness. I don&apos;t intend to stop at the preview board, check it out, have someone pull up behind me wondering what I&apos;m doing sitting there with no one in front of me, pull forward and still have to spend time looking at the menu while your manager leans on you from behind. It will take the same exact amount of time for me to get my food whether I use the preview board or just the menu, which is what I, as a customer, care about.

Also, you know full well that&quot;a lot&quot;of ketchup is more than two packets.

Short version: fast food employment saps the soul. Go get a different job.

And what happens when the customer asks for something with which the customer-service person cannot provide them?


The sense of entitlement displayed toward the lower end of the food-service chain is difficult to fathom. The people aren&apos;t there to take our grief, it&apos;s certainly not part of their job description, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too much to ask of the customer to look up and notice the LACK OF FUCKING ARCHES before attempting to order a Whopper, two orders of McNuggets, and&quot;Biggie&quot;size it- at fucking Sonic.


I&apos;m reasonbly confident that a lot of grief that drive-thru guys take is from people so insecure in their own skins that they have to take the embarassment of not realizing which restaurant the&apos;re at out on somebody.

I realize that many customers are rude but that is not what the OP was complaining about.

The preview menus are pretty useless, IMO. They usually have the popular combos and maybe some specials. Then you get to the main menu and you get that stuff and everything else they have - kid&apos;s meals, whatever configurations and prices of nuggets, desserts, all the different drinks and sizes - and that, plus all the&quot;do you want...&quot;from the clerk and you&apos;ll probably end up changing your &apos;previewed&apos; order anyway.

Now if the preview board is exactly the same as the main board, you may have a point. Bookkeeper 08-11-2005, 01:48 PM 1) An there beith a preview board, thou shalt use it. Many drive-thrus now have two separate menu boards - one with the attached speaker, and a second menu one car-length behind the speaker. This is known as a&quot;preview board&quot;because the customer can look it over before advancing to the speaker and starting the restaurant&apos;s speed-of-service timer. If you don&apos;t know what you want, USE this board. Don&apos;t drive past it straight to the speaker, ask the clerk to&quot;gimme a second&quot;, and then spend two or three minutes staring at it while the speed-of-service time gets higher and higher.
I agree totally with this, as a common courtesy issue. However, I should point out that the customer isn&apos;t responsible for your management&apos;s poor choice of a method for determining valid speed-of-service performance.

No Records Found. 5que 08-11-2005, 02:21 PM I am in general agreement with the commandments, with a couple of personal exemptions:

3.a. If your menu is in 8 point type, don&apos;t expect me to be able to immediately find what I am looking for. Particularly when the order seems pretty random. Why exactly is the Gyros and the Gyros Plate two separate entries, separated by about 2 feet of other menu items? And no explanation of what the&quot;plate&quot;gives me, over and above the gyros itself?

8.a. Where I grew up&quot;coke&quot;was a generic term for soda/pop. So don&apos;t get offended that I don&apos;t specifically say&quot;Pepsi.&quot;

And to continue the list:

14.7., subchapter Culvers: When I am placing a large order which includes your frozen custard in a dish, don&apos;t hand me the dish with a spoon in it, then several bags with my rest of my order. I am not eating this in the car. I&apos;m taking it home with the rest of the order. Put a lid on the damn custard and put it in a bag. (Even when I specifically tell them when ordering I need a lid and it in a bag, they do it about 10% of the time.)

32.765. Don&apos;t greet me by trying to sell me whatever you&apos;re pushing today. Just ask for my order.

Hear, hear!

Also: is there really an expectation among most drive-thru customers and employees that any and all will know exactly what they want as soon as they get to the main menu/speaker? I ask because my normal response to&quot;May I take your order?&quot;is&quot;Just one moment, please&quot;.

If so, that expectation is unreasonable, IMHO. 20-30 seconds to hunt for menu items and to decide on what to order is not unreasonable. Most drive-thru menus these days prominently display combo meals, and place the a la carte items in more-difficult-to-read type and locations. Those kind of menus slow things down a lot for folks like me who don&apos;t intend to order a drink and who want to price out items individually.

They&apos;re wins for the customers in line behind the guy who&apos;s violating all of the commandments. At least inside the store, you can step to a different line if some idiot in front of you is arguing about how he wants a Whopper (at McD&apos;s) and coaxing his darling children to make up their minds on their orders, all the while bitching at someone while on the cell phone.

Want me to put hy-phens be-tween the syl-la-bles? fessie 08-11-2005, 02:32 PM When I worked at KFC, people would occasionally walk all the way in to our restaurant and still manage to order the wrong thing. As in, a pizza.

I was a teenager at the time, and I found such lapses and the kinds of things listed in the above Commandments simply beyond understanding. Most of our customers were really great, we were a neighborhood restaurant with a lot of regulars. But the ones who weren&apos;t with the program drove me batshit. And we didn&apos;t even have a drive-thru.

The thing is, at the time I didn&apos;t have anything else on my plate. Taking care of myself and avoiding my parents - that was about it.

Recently, when my babies were really young, I went through a period of intense distraction. The best I could do for an outing (that&quot;me time&quot;we all need) was a trip to the drive-thru. Fifteen glorious minutes away from the screaming, crying and pooping. Vastly sleep-deprived and completely stressed out, I never knew where I was. And I was always on the phone - that was my only chance to vent about how much I was struggling.

It would be great if everyone could operate at top efficiency at all times, but we can&apos;t.

Although I agree that there is some level of stupidity (on the customer&apos;s behalf) there, you would know that they meant: a burger, two orders of nuggets/strips, and make everything large.

Maybe I justify this because I am the person that refers to all the little stores attached to gas stations as&quot;AMPMs&quot;.

I&apos;m talking about customers/employees who are peeved that people are doing perfectly ordinary and acceptable things like spending half a minute reading over a menu/doing a little head math. Put more plainly: the OP&apos;s First Commandment is way off and should be stricken. UncleRojelio 08-11-2005, 03:05 PM Dude ... sorry. You can&apos;t wait 30 seconds? Really?

So only those who know precisely what they want before they go to the drive-thru should use the drive-thru? No menu-reading allowed? In your world, perhaps these menus are unnecessary?

Dude. The answer is yes. Don&apos;t get in line if you don&apos;t know exactly what you want and can roll if off your tongue in one long, well-scripted, breath. After ordering about a million McKids Super-Duper meals with Frosty instead of a Pepsi, I am an expert and I don&apos;t need you pickin&apos; your nose in front of me trying to make up your mind between a Royal w/ Cheese or a Douple Whooper w/ Jalapenos. Go inside! NotWithoutRage 08-11-2005, 03:10 PM Dude. The answer is yes.

After ordering about a million McKids Super-Duper meals with Frosty instead of a Pepsi, I am an expert and I don&apos;t need you pickin&apos; your nose in front of me trying to make up your mind between a Royal w/ Cheese or a Douple Whooper w/ Jalapenos. Go inside!

Agreed. If you don&apos;t know what you want, or don&apos;t know how much you can afford, go the fuck inside.

I realize you don&apos;t care about the people behind you, and you certainly don&apos;t care about the cashier, but most drive-thrus have&quot;seconds of service&quot;meters, that monitors how long it takes for your car to get from start to finish. That&apos;s why the cashier will&quot;park&quot;you if the food isn&apos;t ready yet. They don&apos;t want you in the lane. If the number goes way up for your stupidity, you don&apos;t get yelled at or threatened, do you? FatBaldGuy 08-11-2005, 03:10 PM Maybe I justify this because I am the person that refers to all the little stores attached to gas stations as&quot;AMPMs&quot;. OK, I&apos;ll bite. What is an AMPM? Left Hand of Dorkness 08-11-2005, 03:11 PM Frankly, your inability to understand big color pictures and three-inch letters on an outdoor menu aren&apos;t my concern.
Frankly, that throbbing vein in your forehead isn&apos;t my concern. Chill out, turn on the radio, and breathe.

As for how I can design databases yet not expertly navigate a fast-food menu, it&apos;s because I&apos;ve got a good mind for logical relationships and math, but a bad mind for spatial relationships. Fast-food menus with lots of color, items organized in a fashion that seems arbitrary to me, are not so easy for me to read.

In the interests of full disclosure, I eat fast food maybe once a month, and I use a drive-through maybe once a year: I prefer to eat at a table. But when I use one, I&apos;m not there to show off my leet fast-food fu and amazing skills at remembering product jingles. I really couldn&apos;t care less whether I call your nasty pseudo-food by its appropriate brand name, and if you decide to give me attitude over that, I&apos;ll drizzle you with contempt. If, however, you politely correct me (&quot;Is Pepsi okay? We don&apos;t do filet-o-fish, but we do have a WhaleVomit-o-Rama, will that work?&quot;) then I&apos;ll politely apologize and we can both get on with our sad existences.

Just remember that your restaurant has next to no importance in my world. You have importance as a person taht I want to treat with respect, but I don&apos;t care about your different brand names, the sizes in which you offer different nasty products, or the like. I just want sustenance with a minimum of fuss.

20-30 seconds to decide on an order is&quot;stupidity&quot;? Fuck impatient people. bordelond 08-11-2005, 03:14 PM OK, I&apos;ll bite. What is an AMPM?
A 24-hour convenience store, AFAIK. Think of it as&quot;a.m./p.m.&quot;. Happy Scrappy Hero Pup 08-11-2005, 03:14 PM bordelond, I refer you again to the actual text of the First Commandment:

1) An there beith a preview board, thou shalt use it. Many drive-thrus now have two separate menu boards - one with the attached speaker, and a second menu one car-length behind the speaker. This is known as a&quot;preview board&quot;because the customer can look it over before advancing to the speaker and starting the restaurant&apos;s speed-of-service timer. If you don&apos;t know what you want, USE this board. Don&apos;t drive past it straight to the speaker, ask the clerk to&quot;gimme a second&quot;, and then spend two or three minutes staring at it while the speed-of-service time gets higher and higher.

He&apos;s asking for a bit of consideration- don&apos;t start his clock when you&apos;ve got a whole separate area for head-scratching and indecision. And I have no problem with that.

Big difference between 30 seconds and three minutes. cowgirl 08-11-2005, 03:16 PM [display of fast-food ignorance]Um, how hard is it to decide what you want at a fast food place? I mean, outside of buying 7-layer burritos at Taco Bell I can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve been to a fast-food restaurant, drive-through or otherwise, and I could probably tell you what&apos;s on most of their menus: burgers (made with&quot;beef,&quot;chicken or fish); small/med/large/humongo fries; small/med/large/humongo soft drinks (coke/diet/sprite/orange/root beer if lucky); breaded chicken in some shape (nuggets/strips/fingers/noses); onion rings; and other items depending on the chain (fried chicken at KFC, various combinations of tortilla, meat, cheese and veg at Taco Bell, etc).

Why does it take so long to decide what you want? By the time you&apos;ve decided to go to the drive-through in the first place, aren&apos;t you thinking something along the lines of&quot;Man, I could really go for a burger and fries right about now.&quot;So order the damn burger and fries. What&apos;s the problem? Do you ever, when faced with a McD&apos;s menu, say to yourself&quot;Wow! I didn&apos;t know they sold THOSE!&quot;?

Right :rolleyes: That&apos;s the typical experience. A customer takes half a minute to decide what they want, and a employee gets yelled at.

Bullshit -- there&apos;s no way that&apos;s the default situation.

I worked fast food myself (admittedly back in the 80s). If a manager is the type to berate, any excuse will do and nothing the customer does can ultimately prevent verbal abuse. bordelond 08-11-2005, 03:20 PM He&apos;s asking for a bit of consideration- don&apos;t start his clock when you&apos;ve got a whole separate area for head-scratching and indecision.
I&apos;ve never seen a place with such a&quot;separate area&quot;, save for at Chick-Fil-A. I&apos;ve seen preview boards with popular combos listed ... but I don&apos;t do combos very often.

Also -- different locations of the same chain often have different items on their budget menus (esp. McDonalds, believe it or not). What is and is not on those $1 menus often influence what I order, and I&apos;ve never seen a place that had this on their preview board. YMMV. Corrvin 08-11-2005, 03:21 PM Thou shall not expect my business if there are no cars in front of me and no cars parked in the lot and I am told to&quot;wait a minute&quot;by the person on the other end of the speaker.

So employees aren&apos;t allowed to visit the restroom AND wash their hands?

Gotta go sometime, and the best time is when there are NO cars in the drivethru and none in the parking lot...

...aw, man, did somebody just pull up? UncleRojelio 08-11-2005, 03:22 PM Do you ever, when faced with a McD&apos;s menu, say to yourself&quot;Wow! I didn&apos;t know they sold THOSE!&quot;?


I&apos;ve never said that at the scottish restaurant, no. But, after 30 years of going to Sonic, I still find stuff on that menu that I swear was never there before. Getting back to the OP, it&apos;s okay to pull into a Sonic and have a lesiurely nose-pick while you peruse the menu. Just don&apos;t hit the button till you have it all lined up in your brain.

I may have something in mind, but want to check what the daily special is. I may want to see if they have added something new to the menu. The only times fast food drive thru ordering has gone over two or three minutes from start to finish, is when the restaurant has goofed and needs me to pull over.

Question for those in the know. Does the seconds of service counter keep going if for whatever reason, they&quot;park you&quot;? Left Hand of Dorkness 08-11-2005, 03:26 PM When I go through drive-throughs, it&apos;s usually because I&apos;m in the car with other folks, on a road trip.

So yeah, it can take me a good thirty seconds to figure out what I want. And if it takes someone else thirty seconds, it&apos;s okay: that vein in my forehead won&apos;t begin a drumroll.

Very often -- yes.

A specific example from among many -- some locations of McDonald&apos;s sell Spicy Chicken sandwiches on the $1 menu. Other locations don&apos;t sell them at all. I consider the Spicy Chicken sandwich better than the burgers, so I always take a few seconds to peruse the $1 menu at a McD drive-thru to see if they&apos;ve got them.

For some people, the McRib sandwich is similar -- another item not sold at all locations.

Some more McDonald&apos;s examples -- apple pies and hash browns. Some locations sell them at 2/$1.00 all the time. Other locations sell them for 99 cents most of the time, and 2/$1.00 occasionally as a special. I will check the menu on their price, because I&apos;ll usually bite on the 2-for-a-buck deal.

No I do not, and no thank you as to your kind offer for me to go inside. If you&apos;d like this change, try petitioning the restaurants to have a time-limit on ordering.

You&apos;ll find that the folks who set up the restaurant are perfectly happy to allow me to take 30 seconds to order, I wager.

What Left Hand said.

And if Left Hand is a vegetarian, s/he will have to peruse the average fast food menu board a bit more closely. And I can&apos;t think of a valid reason s/he shouldn&apos;t be afforded the same convenience to do it from the comfort of her car as anyone else would.

I&apos;ll post it again -- if you really can&apos;t wait for a line of a half-dozen or more cars, don&apos;t harp that everyone in line needs to hurry up. I suggest that you get out of the car and order inside. You usually will get your food faster than if you had waited in that long drive-thru line.

Sure, but:
1) If I break his rule and don&apos;t go inside, everything continues hunky-dory.
2) If he breaks my rule and refuses to wait his fucking turn (e.g., tries to break in line in the drive-through), I guaranfuckingtee that pandemonium will break loose.

Cackling softly.

Daniel UncleRojelio 08-11-2005, 04:02 PM Okay, you caught me. I wasn&apos;t reading the menu, I was looking in my rear-view mirror.

And, since there was no one behind me, when I finally got to the damn speaker, I order a McHaggis just to see what the order-drone would say.

*snicker* ouryL 08-11-2005, 04:03 PM Having worked far too long in the food service industry, i&apos;ve seen my share of people who seem to have absolutely no idea how drive-thru restaurants work. I&apos;ve suffered no end of heartache and aggravation from people who can&apos;t seem to grasp what should be blatantly obvious, and i&apos;ve finally come to the conclusion that what the world needs is a simple guide to the thou shalts and thou shalt nots of the process. So here it is - a guide to the uninformed and a pitting of the clueless.

1) An there beith a preview board, thou shalt use it. Many drive-thrus now have two separate menu boards - one with the attached speaker, and a second menu one car-length behind the speaker. This is known as a&quot;preview board&quot;because the customer can look it over before advancing to the speaker and starting the restaurant&apos;s speed-of-service timer. If you don&apos;t know what you want, USE this board. Don&apos;t drive past it straight to the speaker, ask the clerk to&quot;gimme a second&quot;, and then spend two or three minutes staring at it while the speed-of-service time gets higher and higher.

2)Thou shalt not shout&quot;Hello?&quot;or honk thy horn if there is a delay at the speaker. Just because the clerk isn&apos;t ready to take your order the second you pull up doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ve taken off their headset, clocked out, and gone home. Shouting&quot;Hello?&quot;or honking your horn will not make whatever the clerk is working on go away and it WON&apos;T get your order taken any faster - it only aggravates the clerk and potentially deafen them when they get a 110-decibal blast in the speaker strapped directly onto their ear.

3) Thou shalt not ask the clerk questions that could be answered by reading the menu. How much does the chicken sandwich cost? What comes on the TripleMax Superburger Deluxe? This is what the menu is FOR. It&apos;s the big thing right in front of you with all the words and numbers on it, not to mention the great big pictures where each item has been carefully posed to display each of its ingredients in larger-than-life detail. Use it.

4) Thou shalt NOT add to thy order at the window. Doing this requires the clerk to go back in and change your order (which at many restaurants requires a manager&apos;s approval to void part or all of the order), delays us getting your order out while we make whatever you decided you just couldn&apos;t live without during the lengthy 20&apos; drive from the speaker to the window, and delays everyone behind you getting what they want as well. Just don&apos;t do it.

5) If there is a line at the window, thou shalt start counting thy money before reaching it. We tell you what your total is at the speaker. Most restaurants also have video screens that show your total in big numbers. There is no reason for you to not know your total before you leave the speaker. If there&apos;s a car ahead of you at the window, there is no reason for you not to start counting out your money before you get there. Reaching the window after a three-minute wait and THEN deciding to start counting out the $37 in nickels you intend to pay me with is just lazy.

6) Thou shalt use actual numbers when ordering a quantity greater than one. I don&apos;t know how many&quot;a couple&quot;,&quot;a bunch&quot;,&quot;a lot&quot;, or&quot;a shitload&quot;of hamburgers is. I never learned those numbers in kindergarten. If you ask me for such a quantity, I will ask you to be more specific. The same goes for sauces. Our default is to give you one package of sauce for each item that requires it. If you ask me for a specific larger number I will give you that many, but if you ask me for&quot;a bunch&quot;or&quot;a lot&quot;I will give you two packages for each item. If you ask me for&quot;a shitload&quot;I may ask you not to come back to my store.

7) Thou shalt NOT use curse words into the drive-thru speaker. This one follows from the Sixth Commandment. The speaker you&apos;re talking into is connected to a loudspeaker which is audible to everyone in the kitchen and, often, to everyone in the lobby as well. This is a family business and more often than not there are children dining in our lobby. It is not appropriate for you to pull up to my speaker and start using profanity towards me, let alone my staff and customers. An idle slip of the tongue may be excused, but do it again and you&apos;ll be asked to leave.

8) Thou shalt not order another restaurant&apos;s menu items from us. We don&apos;t sell Big Macs here. We don&apos;t sell Whoppers here.

Make sure you have the ability to pay for your order BEFORE you order it. Pulling up to the window and then&quot;discovering&quot;that you forgot your wallet won&apos;t earn you any sympathy from those of us who just busted our asses to make your order and now have to throw it all out. And no, it WON&apos;T get you any free food, either.

10) Thou shalt not, not, NOT, EVER, ask the clerk to&quot;hook you up&quot;. This is a business, not a charity. You want free food? Go to the food bank downtown. We&apos;re in business to make money, not feed your broke ass. I don&apos;t even know you. Why would I risk my job by giving away free food to a complete stranger? No, not if you give me a puff off your peace pipe. No, not if your girlfriend shows me her tits (and what kind of girl flashes a complete stranger for a 99-cent sandwich anyway?) No, not if you&apos;re really good buddies with the manager or the area coach or Sally in Accounting, because right here and right now I AM the manager and i&apos;ve never seen you before in my life.

Unbelievers, repent your sins and be saved. Anybody else got any commandments they&apos;d like to throw in before I break out the chisel?

Wait a second before pulling up in front of the order grille.

But if this (stopping the seconds) is still true:

a) what a huge cheat if it isn&apos;t honestly factored in somehow,

b) sure it&apos;s a minor annoyance, but still, a free fries&quot;comp&quot;vs. customer satisfaction? Seems like a no brainer to me. Yes, I&apos;ve worked retail. In fact I&apos;ve worked complaint desks. Which makes this even more baffling to me. The worst possible outcome of drive thru ordering (other than food poisoning leading to death I suppose) is getting&quot;parked&quot;. Just seems like common sense to me to balance the irritation of the customer with a relatively minor coupon or something. This shows such a lack of foresight and/or customer service that it boggles my mind. (Well, forgetting the straws for drinks too, but I&apos;m usually headed home with the booty and have straws and even glasses there.) Chanteuse 08-11-2005, 06:11 PM A couple rules for drive-thru employees:

1) Thou shalt not, when I present the $5 for my $4.32 order, ask,&quot;Do you have 32 cents?&quot;If I wanted to dig around for it, I&apos;d have already done so. It won&apos;t kill you to count out 68 cents from your register. And it probably takes less time than waiting for me to root around my purse for change.

2) Thou shalt not wait until I get to the window to tell me you have to cook the pies I ordered. If business is so slow that I&apos;m the only one in line, then you have the time to notice that all the pies are gone. If it&apos;s busy, then the person who takes the last pie should know that more will need to be dropped. I don&apos;t mind waiting for the things, but I do object to ordering, then waiting for three or four cars ahead of me, and only then, when I get to the window do I find that you JUST NOW put the pies on to cook. (I knew this was true because I worked at that very restaurant--I was aware of just how long it took pies, fries, etc to cook. By the time I got to the window, they should&apos;ve been in the oil at LEAST two minutes.)

Former (and recovering) fast-food manager speaking, Wendy&apos;s division. Left fast food management in 1992 and have not been stressed by any job since.

I worked about about half a dozen stories in a 50-mile radius from home, and all of them worked more or less the same: a photoelectric eye simply read whether there was a car parked immediately outside the window, when it pulled up, and how long it (the car, not the window) stayed.

The photoelectric eye could be cheated easily if a drive-through attendant had long arms, a good grip on something heavy (such as a cash register) and a large, flat, opaque object (such as a food tray) to cover the eye with. Not that I ever did that.

A clock by the window gave average service times for the periods of 11-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-11. However, the clock we initially had did not give car counts or Time At Menuboard.

Then new clocks were installed, which were tied to the menuboard, to the order count at the register (to compare to actual number of cars at window), and to the menu speaker (to count how long it took to greet an incoming car, and how long it took to take that car&apos;s order). It was much easier to tell if the car count varied widely from the order count (i.e., the drive-through cashier was cheating the photoelectric eye).

Generally speaking, I as a manager didn&apos;t give a rat&apos;s patootie about how long it took to take a customer&apos;s order, because there was very little anybody could do to speed up that process if the customer wanted time to be slow. Service times were a priority for a few weeks after the district manager inevitably said they weren&apos;t good enough, until it again became clear that customers were deliberately trying to thwart us. Cars stalled while sitting on the timer, driving service times up to 999 seconds and pinning the needle, so to speak; customers talked on the phone, added orders on at the window, bypassed the menu so they could order face-to-face, friends stopped by to chat with the cashier, got out of their car to look under the window for the dimes they dropped, checked their order and handed out the correct kid toys to the correct children, finished their beers, etc.

So... service times are a thing which people in very serious suits in offices far away think about, as if they can measure money in seconds, while people who actually have to work at the damn place realize that customers can never and will never give a shit as long as they get their food a) right b) fast and c) tasty, or as tasty as possible under the circumstances.


At least when I worked as a manager, we were not permitted by The Rules to give the cashiers the autonomy to give out free fries, coupons, drinks, or anything else at will for orders which had to be pulled ahead for any reason. For the most part, based on the average age and experience of the workforce, I agree with the policy. There are simply not enough managers on-shift to personally give compensatory gifts to any and every customer who feels slightly inconvenienced. (Add to this that the food cost of the coupon came out of my store&apos;s P&amp;L statement, even if they redeemed it at the Wendy&apos;s across town, so we were not even budgeted for this kind of largesse.) UncleRojelio 08-11-2005, 08:56 PM 1) Thou shalt not, when I present the $5 for my $4.32 order, ask,&quot;Do you have 32 cents?&quot;If I wanted to dig around for it, I&apos;d have already done so.

Speaking of which, how come nobody knows how to count out change anymore? They just count out the amount that the register tells them. In the old days, we were taught to start at the sale amount and count up to the amount tendered.

When I worked at this particular fast food joint, they did NOT allow us to use the&quot;cash tendered&quot;button. They had discovered that any time the registers were inoperable (say a brief power outage or simple malfunction), the cashiers were unable to compute change. So they just made us learn how from the very start. For a while there, I couldn&apos;t see any number under 100 without mentally calculating the remainder. (For example, if I saw or heard the number 37, my mind automatically responded with the number 63.) This is the cashier&apos;s version of an earworm! bmoak 08-11-2005, 10:04 PM I&apos;m not going to go so far as to&quot;champion the cause&quot;, but IMO confusing two very similar fast food joint&apos;s food isn&apos;t the stupidest mistake a person can make.

Ray Kroc is probably turning over in his grave. :) How many billions in advertising has McD&apos;s spent over the decades to associate its menu items with its brand and people still go to the competition thinking they serve Big Macs? VegemiteMoose 08-11-2005, 10:18 PM Okay I know it&apos;s&quot;walk thru&quot;, but really!

I returned from the Liquor Store tonight with an extra $12.75. Well, extra if you consider that my math skills countered what the register&quot;told&quot;the cashier to say. No, my purchase did not total $33.10, it totalled $20.35. Hey LOOK --&gt;on the flat screen register you just entered two single bottles as two 4 packs. Smapti 08-11-2005, 10:36 PM Whew, I post a simple rant and when I come back from work it&apos;s longer than the Battlestar Galactica thread. Anyway:

On speed-of-service and parking cars: Most drive-thrus have a timer that starts the second your car trips the sensor at the speaker box and continues counting until the car leaves the window. These times are averaged up over dayparts (breakfast, lunch, late-night etc). and each shift has a time that their average is supposed to be underneath. (For example, on the shift I usually work our quota is 4:30.) Management uses these numbers for everything from employee performance reviews to determining the size of raises.&quot;Parking&quot;a car does stop the timer, but that&apos;s typically not why it&apos;s done. Where I currently work, our policy is that we park you if your order will take more than 30 seconds to prepare and the order for the car behind you is already ready. For the inconvienience we usually throw in a dessert or a free upsize.

On upselling the special item of the month: I have to agree with the people who said they don&apos;t like it when drive-thru people do this to them. This is something that management makes us do in the hopes of moving more units of that particular item (and it does work).

On preview boards: Yes, I realize that not all restaurant chains have these, and of those that do some only have part of the menu on it. But a great many do, including the one I work at, and it surprises me how so many people don&apos;t even seem to notice it - they drive right into the lane when there&apos;s nobody ahead of or behind them, zoom right past it up to the speaker, and then spend two minutes staring at the board while we all wait for them to speak up so we can start cooking. Ashes, Ashes 08-12-2005, 12:18 AM I detest being asked to pull ahead. What a way to tell your customers that they don&apos;t mean crap to management and/or corporate, they&apos;re just a reason to put the spurs to your harrassed workers. I love being the cause of stress to someone who&apos;s already working hard and just trying to make a living.

I also dislike that policy because it&apos;s now going to take forever for my order to be readied and someone is free to walk it out. The Jack&apos;s that is worst about this has the longest walk in the world from the door to the drive way, as well. Then I&apos;m also forced to make people behind me drive around me in a busy, but tiny parking lot.

A tip for places with drive throughs: Make sure the person working the window speaks enough english to take and confirm orders.


And no-one short of James Bond could remove the plastic top from one of those filled-to-beyond-the-brim drinks in a moving vehicle, drink from it, replace the top, and not wind up soaked. Not driving a standard. No way, Jack.
Bow down to my mighty drinking and driving skills! Okay, that came out wrong. In any case, as I drive, I can not only get the top off and straw placed, but I can add lemon and sweetener to my iced tea without spilling. For extra difficulty points I can do all that while getting back on a busy freeway. Yep, I drive a manual and no cupholder just my lap. Does this mean I&apos;m James Bond? If so, I want to be the Sean Connery James Bond, not the Timothy Dalton one, please. VegemiteMoose 08-12-2005, 12:38 AM Thanks for the response Smapti. But please, let&apos;s call it something other than&quot;speed of service&quot;if it conveniently disregards those whose service is not speedy. Ashes, Ashes 08-12-2005, 12:41 AM A tip for places with drive throughs: Make sure the person working the window speaks enough english to take and confirm orders.
Just to be clear, the employee didn&apos;t speak enough english to understand I wanted a #1 meal. While I was at the window, they were treated rather rudely by the counter cashier, who certainly had no trouble with the english language. I can understand being short staffed, but that just didn&apos;t seem like a very wise re-distribution of the staff.

As a former cashier I can tell you that 99.999% of the time that happens the register guy is running low on change and doesn&apos;t want to wait for the manager to walk to the safe and come back with a roll of pennies.

The restaurants can&apos;t win. The customer complains if he&apos;s pulled ahead to wait an additional minute while food is made hot and fresh; he complains if he&apos;s given food that isn&apos;t hot and fresh. He complains if he has to wait at the window. He complains that the order is handed to him so fast that he doesn&apos;t have time to put his change back in his wallet.

Some people should just go back to hunting and gathering. sturmhauke 08-12-2005, 04:07 AM On speed-of-service and parking cars: Most drive-thrus have a timer that starts the second your car trips the sensor at the speaker box and continues counting until the car leaves the window.

The customers are not there to make your numbers look good, you are there for their convenience. I agree that customers shouldn&apos;t pull up and change their minds 20 times while arguing with their boatload of brats and someone else on a cell phone, but if they&apos;re just looking at the menu your service numbers are your own goddamn problem. If the customer spends the same total time in the drive thru, but your numbers vary depending on whether they looked at the preview board first, then management has their heads up their ass. Duck Duck Goose 08-12-2005, 04:50 AM I&apos;m rubber, you&apos;re glue. Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you

Trust me, it takes less time for you to root around in your purse.

My experience as a cashier was a bit different, I guess. Almost 100% of the time, we had mucho extra rolls of coins. I rarely had to go get change--at least in coin form--and I remember only a couple of times that another register needed me to give them pennies. Primarily, a customer only had to wait on change if he presented a large bill for a small dollar order--dollar bills always seemed to run out quickly. And lowly cashiers were not allowed to change $50&apos;s and $100&apos;s, we had to get management (I hated this SO bad). But I wouldn&apos;t mind it so much if I was told,&quot;I&apos;m out of pennies, do you have any change?&quot;Rarely, if ever, when I couldn&apos;t pony up the coins did I hear this--they just counted the change from the drawer.

There were a couple of times that a cashier opened rolls of coins just before counting time at the end of her shift (a fast food type of short-sheeting a bed, you know) so the manager (or ass&apos;t manager) had piles of coins to count. It&apos;s a good thing some of them had a sense of humor (no, I never had the guts to try it)! :D Left Hand of Dorkness 08-12-2005, 06:52 AM but of course, as a comeback from some one chronically over the age of 5 years old, it&apos;s still pretty fucking lame.

I went to an Applebee&apos;s last night to pick up a take-out order. The pick-up spots were taken so I had to go inside. The girl who rang up my order did something which caused the register to pop open but apparently didn&apos;t tell her how much change to give me. She worked on it mentally for at least five minutes, then handed me the wrong change. I gave it back and told her how much it should be. She then tried to work it out with a pencil and paper and got it wrong again. Finally I put all my stuff down, rooted around in my purse for a calculator, and showed her.

If thou hast an unusual order, one that is far larger than normal (as in for an entire football team), or yea is even just more complicated than normal [cut the burger in half with mustard on the left side and mayonaisse on the right and a pickle on top of the bun] or requires several different payors, PLEASE go inside.


This one is applicable to the drive-up bank window,as well. I get my paychecks direct-deposited to minimize use of the drive-thru, but people occasionally cut me paper checks.

I seem to always get behind: 1) People with tons of coins who can&apos;t read the signs telling them to take large amounts of coins inside. 2)People with 4-th party checks who argue with the teller,make the teller get a supervisor, argue with the supervisor, finally yell&quot;Fuck You&quot;and speed off.3) People who try to get credit card cash advances via drivethru DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS at the walk-in side (I realize that emergencies happen on weekend afternoons or after 5 pm weekdays, so I&apos;ll cut some slack there).

One of the benefits of vegetarianism is comfortable bowel control.

Daniel Smapti 08-12-2005, 09:52 AM I agree that customers shouldn&apos;t pull up and change their minds 20 times while arguing with their boatload of brats and someone else on a cell phone, but if they&apos;re just looking at the menu your service numbers are your own goddamn problem. If the customer spends the same total time in the drive thru, but your numbers vary depending on whether they looked at the preview board first, then management has their heads up their ass.

Well, I never said anything about where the heads of our corporate overlords may or may not be located. :) FatBaldGuy 08-12-2005, 09:53 AM I detest being asked to pull ahead. What a way to tell your customers that they don&apos;t mean crap to management and/or corporate, they&apos;re just a reason to put the spurs to your harrassed workers. I love being the cause of stress to someone who&apos;s already working hard and just trying to make a living.

I also dislike that policy because it&apos;s now going to take forever for my order to be readied and someone is free to walk it out. The Jack&apos;s that is worst about this has the longest walk in the world from the door to the drive way, as well. Then I&apos;m also forced to make people behind me drive around me in a busy, but tiny parking lot.I have often been tempted to refuse to pull forward and say&quot;No, thanks. I&apos;ll just wait here until my order is ready.&quot;But I&apos;ve never actually had the guts to do it. Has anyone ever actually done this, and what were the results? UncleRojelio 08-12-2005, 09:54 AM One of the benefits of vegetarianism is comfortable bowel control.l

I miss all the fun threads. Page one, I&apos;m reading through with my mouse over the reply button, itching to click. Page two, the urge is almost irresistable. Page three, I&apos;ve got most of a post lined up in my mind. And now it&apos;s page four, and the scatalogical jokes are all about.

Damn.

Well, I&apos;m a gonna throw what I got out here anyway, flinging my opinion forth like a monkey with a fistful of...

No, no, I&apos;m better than that.*

Much of the contention in this thread is kind of a customer vs. establishment vibe that, let&apos;s face it, has always been and will always be around. I&apos;d like to be clear up front, I&apos;m not touching that part of the argument. I believe the Customer needs to fight for what they want, or companies claiming to be Customer Focused, or whatever they like to say, won&apos;t know just what their customers want.

No, I wanted to try and explain just what Customer Service means. See, to most Customer Service industries like fast food, the&quot;Customer&quot;the serve is a plural term, not singular. So while,&quot;I don&apos;t care about your time, you&apos;re here to serve me!&quot;might make you feel better, it does nothing for the people in line behind you. And no, I&apos;m not being drawn into the 30 seconds/3 minutes argument. The point is, the quality of service decisions they make are targeted at all their customers, not just one.

So I work for an airline, one of a few that doesn&apos;t assign seats to their passengers. A strange idea that has gotten complaints, which are outweighed by compliments. The decision still boils down to: More customers like it because they board planes faster, pick seats they want (such as, away from the creepy guy or the crying baby), and don&apos;t have to play match the illegible print on their ticket with the tiny, faded plaquard above the seats. It works for us, because we turn our planes faster, fit more flights in a single day, move more passengers places, etc., etc. Sometimes a good customer service move pays off immeditaly, others trickle down. Really good decisions do both.

These drive-through commandments follow the same logic. Fast food is about delivering quality food as fast as possible. The drive-through area even more so. So while their desire to move you through the line at a less than serene pace seems callous, it&apos;s not about you. It&apos;s about the 1.5 billion served.


On a side note, the preview menus are pretty common around here. What&apos;s truly innovative is what I like to call the double-barreled McDonalds. Only one I&apos;ve seen like it, they added on a second drive through lane. One menu, shared by all, then you choose a lane as you pull around. Either you&apos;re next to the window in the building, or a small brick hut. Both have clerks to take your money, and dispense drinks. If you&apos;re in the outer lane, someone from inside runs your food out to you.

Looks like a lot of work for them, but darn, they&apos;re efficient! They don&apos;t even tell you which lane to pick! You just pull around, and they repeat your order....I&apos;ve been through a couple of times, and they&apos;ve never mixed it up yet. They process an extremely high volume of people every day at lunch, and work hard to keep the machinery rolling.

This is all well and good. But when I&apos;m at the menu, I will scan over it if I damn well please. I am totally convinced that it is reasonable to do so, to boot.

I don&apos;t care what the&quot;typical customer&quot;or the&quot;average customer&quot;does -- I am my own person with my own way of doing things. If I&apos;m marginally slower** at the speaker than the guy that has ordered the same damn thing every day for 20 years, then tough shit.

Oh, yeah. Remember when the LCD screens started going into the menus? So you could see them entering your order? I&apos;m still undecided if this was a good move. As far as I can tell, one of three things happens these days:

1) The screen is broken or missing.

2) The person doesn&apos;t enter my order while I&apos;m sitting there (often, they seem a person behind).

3) The person hits keys so fast, it looks like I&apos;m feeding a small army before they whittle out the errors down to my simple little combo.

I like what many McD&apos;s in my area are doing. No more speakerphone menus. You get one preview menu, then you pull to the window to order with a live person. I suspect the error rate on orders dropped precipitously with that addition. My only improvement would be a second menu behind the guy at the window. Or at least, a reduced menu...maybe just the combos? Because everytime, I look at menu, find my combo, think&quot;#4...I want a #4...&quot;then at the window, it&apos;s,&quot;I&apos;d like a number...er...the...heck, I want a Double Qtr Pounder combo, please.&quot;

You misunderstand me -- the business is offending me in no way, as they are still serving me just fine.

The (apparent?) attitude of the OP towards people take a tad&quot;too long&quot;(whatever that is) at the menu is somewhat off-putting. But it&apos;s not really a biggie (har!) because when push comes to shove, the employee must simply deal with such trivialities, anyway, as part of their job. It&apos;s not an&quot;above and beyond&quot;thing to wait briefly on a menu-scanning customer.

The attitudes of some of the drive-thru customers expressed here in this thread is also off-putting ... but honestly, not particularly relevant. In real life, I have never been honked at or yelled at in a drive through for my extra 20-30 seconds, so I&apos;m certainly not concerned with what random folks on a message board think. I am convinced that the extremely impatient folk in most daily interactions are in a tiny, insignificant, and unreasonable minority, anyhow. D_Odds 08-12-2005, 10:48 AM Ray Kroc is probably turning over in his grave. :) How many billions in advertising has McD&apos;s spent over the decades to associate its menu items with its brand and people still go to the competition thinking they serve Big Macs?
Let him spin.

I visit one of the two major burger chains about once every other year. I never pay attention to which one because, to me, they are the same (very bad). However, Ray and his successors have done a better job at burning their product names into my subconscious. So when I want little bits of battered, fried chicken, I say McNuggets. I don&apos;t need some yoyo giving me a hard time because I didn&apos;t use his store&apos;s specific name.

One of my greatest pet peeves of all from my fast food days was when customers would present coupons or inform me that they are senior citizens and are thus entitled to a 10% discount. In these cases the old ticket had to be voided out and re-entered, driving up speed-of-service times.

I used to use my College Student Discount. If you mentioned it at the speaker, they NEVER applied it. Got so the only way you could get it was to tell them at the window.

If I had it my way ( no pun intended ), I would submit an order via the web and then, at the drive thru, a scanner would read my license plate, whereby the service droids would hand me my stuff without having to have my wheels come to a full and complete stop; the monetary exchange having taken place electronically. sturmhauke 08-12-2005, 02:45 PM Welcome to Geek Burger, if you haven&apos;t ordered already get the hell out of here.

If there are a line of cars behind me, I don&apos;t have a problem and will pull forward. Don&apos;t you dare tell me to pull forward and park when there is nobody behind me though. As someone else said, my job is not to make your numbers look better.

I had an assistant manager at a McDonalds actually throw my food at me one time because I refused to pull forward with nobody behind me. When I explained that I didn&apos;t care if I was being timed, he called me a liar and said that they don&apos;t time the people in the drive thru. I pointed to the machine and calmly asked&quot;So what does that do?&quot;He then said&quot;Here is your food&quot;and threw the bag at me.

After a nice 20 minute conversation with the owner of the establishment, he was fired and I got 3 days of free food.

Also, if you don&apos;t want me asking how much a burger is, don&apos;t only offer the combo on the menu with no ala carte pricing. Not my fault that you left that detail off the menu.

And don&apos;t give me a&quot;deer in the headlights&quot;look just because my order came to $4.37 and I gave you $10.37. Just because you saw the $10 in my hand and punched it into the register before I gave you the money is no excuse to not be able to do 3rd grade math.

Also, if you say you close at Midnight and I get there at 11:40, don&apos;t tell me you are closed so you can clean up and get out precisely at 12. This little gem happened to me last weekend after I had driven for 15 minutes to get to your little shithole of a restaurant.

Finally, stop getting my order wrong. You repeated it correctly and then screwed it up. It&apos;s not rocket science. Look at the fucking screen and check that what you put in the bag is what you were supposed to put in the bag.

He complains if he has to wait at the window. He complains that the order is handed to him so fast that he doesn&apos;t have time to put his change back in his wallet.
Some people should just go back to hunting and gathering.
Perhaps others are unreasonable in the way you describe, but I just want to order, pay, get my food, and leave. I don&apos;t eat out if I have to be somewhere at a certain time, so I&apos;ve got no problem with fast food places that don&apos;t get my food to me at Mach 10 (I also don&apos;t mind waiting a bit at the speaker to order, if someone has to search the menu, or if the line is long, either).

All I ask is that you don&apos;t take my money and pull a fake-out on me by having me pull forward. It&apos;s not just an additional minute, I&apos;ve waited in parking lots so long I eventually parked and went inside. That&apos;s when, if I were the sort to complain about fairly minor crap, I would point out my food had been sitting in it&apos;s bag for so long, waiting to be taken out to my car, that the food was not hot and fresh. If we&apos;d all just waited our turns, and the workers weren&apos;t pulling some fancy kung fu with the timers, my food would not have been rendered even less gourmet than usual.

Compensated for my wait? Not in my universe has that ever happened.

The main thing is to keep your order simple: no elaborate special orders (hold the mayo, extra pickles, fresh onions instead of dehydrated onions, don&apos;t toast the bun, light on the lettuce, blah blah blah) and no ordering a metric shitload of food (say, for a van full of high school baseball players after a game).

C&quot;your total is X at the first window&quot; Left Hand of Dorkness 08-13-2005, 08:02 AM I dont even work or eat fast food and those people drive me crazy. (well I eat the stuff once in awhile but we are talking a drive through every 6 months or so)
You people and your high blood pressure! Where&apos;s the percentage in being so easily driven crazy?

The Dumbfuck order you described is very often the most intelligent way to order: the employee may well have a specific order in which items must be punched into the keyboard, and the experience that is to you unique and exciting and full of anticipation is an experience that they&apos;ll repeat 100 times that hour. Your food order is fuzzing into all other food orders they&apos;ve taken during their shift: they aren&apos;t going to remember what you said more than two seconds beyond your having said it.

So instead of giving them the entire order at once, allow them to ask the questions that will result in their entering your information correctly into the computer. This isn&apos;t some great act of Gandhian magnanimity on your part: this is an attempt to get your request correctly filled.

At the very least, if someone else takes these precautions to make their own life easier, you may want to dial your stressometer down a notch, so that your head isn&apos;t constantly exploding.

Daniel cabdude 08-13-2005, 08:15 AM A: How you doing? Me, I&apos;m doing great. Yes, I&apos;m ready to order. I&apos;d like some food. Yes. Food. A burger, maybe. No, make that two. And a drink. Hmmm. Maybe a pie. Or two. And a straw. Thanks. Here ya go. You have a great day, two. Bubbye.

B: NO CONVERSATION!!! NO SOCIAL INTERACTION!!!! ORDER IN ONE BREATH, PAY AND COLLECT IN ONE SWIFT MOTION THEN RUN THE FUCK AWAY!!!! OR DON&apos;T BOTHER COMING IN AT ALL!!! DICK!!! HEAD!!!! jsgoddess 08-13-2005, 11:11 PM All I can say to this thread is that obviously you people don&apos;t go to White Castle.

Because at White Castle, if you don&apos;t have to wait 20 minutes in the drive through, it&apos;s because the restaurant got closed for health violations.

One doesn&apos;t go inside at a Castle. One goes through the drive through and one parks and eats in the car. CanvasShoes 08-13-2005, 11:52 PM &quot;.....meanwhile, you&apos;re holding out my drink/straws whatever while I&apos;m still fiddling with the change you just gave me? what the fuck gives with that program?
Ooooh, I HATE when they do this. They hold out the drink and straws with one hand, and then the other they hold out for the money. And I am one who gets my money and change all ready (not having a stick shift, and I figure it saves ME time as well).

The coins slide around on the top of the dollar bills, so the chances of it dropping while you&apos;re trying to get drink and straw inside are pretty good. And that&apos;s another thing, who the HELL came up with the coins on bills thing????

Anyway, my solution to the&quot;two hands out, one for soda, one for money&quot;, is to sweetly smile, say thank you, take the coke and straw, put it securely in my drink holder, and THEN hand them the money.

Otherwise, I agree with most of what the OP is saying, since a lot of the commandment breakers are more messing with our, their fellow customer&apos;s time than they are with the fast food workers (other than the idiotic service timers).

I mean, what&apos;s it really to the window clerk if the customer is an idiot and takes forever? Again, other than the sevice timer? That is the dumbest thing I&apos;ve ever heard of. I feel bad for the poor fast food worker that they have to deal with it. Since, again, the hold ups are generally moron customer related and not necessarily their, the worker&apos;s, fault.

At least whenever I go to the drive thru. I always get stuck behind some complete dolt who moves at the speed of slug and has 5 bazillion questions for the clerk and so on and so forth. soulmurk 08-14-2005, 12:21 AM I only get 30 minutes for lunch. It takes me anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes to get to a fast food joint nearby, depending on which one I decide on. I always know what I want ahead of time and have a black belt in fast food fu. If not for other customers, I could place my order and pay before the cashier even has my drink ready.

Figuring it takes about 2-3 minutes for food preparation under normal circumstances, typically more like 5-7 during the lunch rush, it then takes me another 5-8 to get back to work, leaving me with ~10-15 minutes to actually eat.

What this means is that there is very little leeway for me to get stuck behind some yahoo who wants to do a price comparison at the order box or argue with the cashier about 32 cents at the payment window. And invariably, I do.

Sure I could bring my lunch to work and bypass the whole scenario, but the fact is, sometimes I really just want that Whopper. So why should I be forced to have to rush and swallow my food without chewing just because the schmuck in front of me doesn&apos;t comprehend how to utilize a relatively simple tool like the drive-through?

Yeah, it may just be 30 seconds extra, but that&apos;s you. If I&apos;m the 4th car in line and everyone thinks that way, that&apos;s two minutes. Two minutes of my precious lunch, and life, that I&apos;ll never get back because you&apos;re an idiot. And then it&apos;s another 20 seconds in line at the grocery store, per person ahead of me. And then another 17.26 seconds at the ATM machine...

Point being, yeah it&apos;s just 30 seconds, but that time adds up. Seconds become minutes become hours of wasted time because you were too inconsiderate to actually put the minimal amount of thought required into properly preparing for the, let&apos;s be honest here, simple act of using a drive-through.

Because I only eat fast food when thosre are really my only criteria: fast and food. You don&apos;t have a fish burger ready? Gimme a chicken burger. Or a hamburger. What DO you have? I&apos;ll take that. Whatever. It doesn&apos;t matter to me all that much.

I want something hot and slightly nutritious to put in my empty belly, but most of all I want it NOW.

If they told me at the ordering menu,&quot;It will be a five minute wait for your order,&quot;I would change my order to something they have ready now. Instead, they wait until after I have confirmed my order and paid for it.

When asked to pull forward and park, I politely reply,&quot;No thank you. I&apos;ll just cancel my order.&quot;Without fail, I have been told,&quot;Just a second.&quot;Suddenly my food is ready and I am on my way. I have yet to figure this one out--if my order was going to take 5 minutes, and a refund may have taken the same amount of time (more or less), how is it that my order is suddenly ready?

I pulled forward and waited once. My food never came. After 10 or 15 minutes of waiting, I went inside and asked for my food. I was told they gave it to me at the drive-thru window and I was accused of trying to get a duplicate order for free. Right then and there I decided I would never again,&quot;pull forward and park&quot;while I waited for someone to bring me my food. CanvasShoes 08-14-2005, 02:21 AM Nitpick.

Just wanna point out that it actually goes:

&quot;I&apos;m rubber, you&apos;re glue,
Bounce off me and sticks to you.&quot;

Which I know isn&apos;t exactly grammatical, as it oughta be,&quot;Bounces off me&quot;, but that&apos;s playground chants for ya.

This version scans better, too.

File for future reference. :D
Really? Not to disbelieve you, but I remember saying the&quot;whatever you say bounces of of me&quot;version way back in the coughlate60scoughcough.

I didn&apos;t know there was a composium of historically correct kid comebacks.

:D CanvasShoes 08-14-2005, 02:42 AM I have often been tempted to refuse to pull forward and say&quot;No, thanks. I&apos;ll just wait here until my order is ready.&quot;But I&apos;ve never actually had the guts to do it. Has anyone ever actually done this, and what were the results?
Absolutely I have. If they&apos;re screwing things up I&apos;m not going to allow them the luxury to take even longer to get the stuff together (and I used to meekly pull ahead, where I was repeatedly forgotten or left until all of the&quot;real&quot;customers had been taken care of).

What to I tell them? I very nicely say&quot;No thank you, I&apos;ll wait here, I&apos;ve experienced your &apos;it will be right out&apos; before&quot;. I am nice about it, but firm. What happens? They get their qualuude drenched little brains in gear and get the stuff done as it SHOULD have been done in the first place.

Thing is, there&apos;s a happy medium here. Folks in a drive-through lane should be spending as much of their attention as they can to making the process go quickly, while still getting the food they want. As long as they&apos;re doing that, you need to recognize that you&apos;re not the only customer, and that the line may not always move as quickly as you want. If you don&apos;t like that, you could always pay some dude ten bucks a day to go pick up your food for you, so that you don&apos;t have to deal with the hoi polloi.

Because there is a little thing that most people seem to have forgotten about called common courtesy. It extends beyond the need to not be personally inconvenienced, which is a high crime to most people, and yet they&apos;re the same hypocrites who have the nerve to roll their eyes when someone is inconvenienced by them.

Though, if it were an option to send a lackey, I would.

Thus the reason I can pull in, order, pay, and be gone in as long as it takes them to process my order and get my food to me. My consideration to others and their lack of the same is exactly what frustrates me and is the entire gist of my statement.

It is not hypocritical to give something and expect it in return, but be upset when it is not. Only if I didn&apos;t offer it in the first place would I not have the right to gripe.

Indeed. They&apos;re giving you all the time you need to make your order, not crowding you, not complaining the least bit no matter how long you take. They expect the same courtesy from you.

Why should your habits take precedent over theirs? It seems to me that you go knowingly into a situation where other folks&apos; legitimate behavior is going to frustrate you; I think you either need to recalibrate your frustration, or not go into the situation.

Again, the rule at fast food is that you have to wait for the people in front of you, not that you have to pace your order according to the desire of the people behind you. If you don&apos;t like that rule, it&apos;s upon you to find a way around it -- e.g., hiring someone to pick up your food for you.

We have different definitions of effective.
My definition is that they use the process to achieve the results they&apos;re trying to achieve. If they leave with the food they want, they&apos;ve succeeded. Your irritation at their efficacy is not their concern.

The name of the game is&quot;fast food&quot;. I need no time, nor do most people. If I do need time to decide, my decision is made by the time the voice comes out of the speaker box asking to take my order. I ensure this habit because I would not deign to be rude enough to steal precious time from the people behind me, or to irritate the hard pressed people inside trying to accomodate a lunch rush.

My habits should take precedence over theirs because I do exactly what is necessary to get my order in and get out of the way as quickly as possible, much to the delight of those behind me and those inside (I&apos;ve actually been complimented and comped by the staff because of my quick and courteous behavior).

I go into these situations because I must. To follow your logic, why should I digress from my routine just because there might be a schmuck in line at the fast food restaurant? Or at the grocery store? Or at the ATM? Or in the movie ticket line?

My frustration stems from my taking the time to be prepared and having to suffer through someone who is not because they couldn&apos;t be bothered to take the 3 seconds to think things through beforehand. Their lack of action shows a disregard and disrespect for everyone around them. Are there worse ways to show it? Sure, but the statement made in line is the same made if they&apos;d deliberately cut me off on the highway.

And, frustration is a perfectly acceptable response. I don&apos;t shout obsenities or honk my horn or flip them off. I don&apos;t drag them out of their car and beat them senseless. I see no wrong with becoming frustrated because some asshole refuses to offer me the same courtesy I offer them.

And the rule of common courtesy is that you do unto others as you would have done unto you.

Regardless, it is not a complicated procedure. There is absolutely no reason for a person to take more than the time it takes to speak your order. If they have 86 cents and don&apos;t know what they can get for 86 cents, go inside. If they have a coupon, mention it while ordering, not at the window. If their wallet is difficult to reach, get it out beforehand. They aren&apos;t a whole lot to ask and in the end they save everyone time. But people can&apos;t be bothered with anything outside of their own little self-centered world.

People go through the drive-through because they&apos;re in a hurry, so the near-sighted grandma in the Lincoln who can&apos;t see well enough to fit the car through the narrow lane, nevermind what her options are, need to go the hell inside or subscribe to Meals-on-Wheels.

The definition I use is summarized in the dictionary as: 1 a : producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect.

Taking their time is neither decided, decisive, nor desired. The desire is to move the line as quickly as possible.

That it is not their concern is exactly the problem. They have no common courtesy. If they did, they&apos;d give a rat&apos;s ass about the world outside their own personal microcosm and realize that their actions are inconveniencing others. sturmhauke 08-15-2005, 01:08 AM I only get 30 minutes for lunch.

Last job I had involved a lot of driving, so I tended to go to a lot of drive thrus. Just because two restaurants are both franchises of the same corporation doesn&apos;t mean they have the same stuff on the menu. The combo meals may be numbered differently, the prices may vary, one restaurant may do combos that aren&apos;t officially listed while another may not, there may be a promotional item that&apos;s not available at all restaurants, etc.

No, she doesn&apos;t. Why is she going through the drive-through, do you think?

The definition I use is summarized in the dictionary as: 1 a : producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect.

Taking their time is neither decided, decisive, nor desired. The desire is to move the line as quickly as possible.
Your desire is irrelevant to whether they&apos;re effective. Only their desire is relevant. If they desire to obtain their food, and they decidedly do obtain their food, then they&apos;ve achieved a decided, desired effect. If the food matches what their decision on the order was, they&apos;ve met the definition perfectly.
That it is not their concern is exactly the problem. They have no common courtesy. If they did, they&apos;d give a rat&apos;s ass about the world outside their own personal microcosm and realize that their actions are inconveniencing others.
Of course they have common courtesy: they&apos;re giving you all the time you need. If they&apos;re not screwing around when their time to order comes (talking on the cell phone, reading, chatting up the speaker), then they&apos;re behaving with perfect courtesy.

If you don&apos;t believe me, I invite you to write to Miss Manners, or the etiquette guru of your choice.

You may not have noticed it but there are diverse people in the world and things don&apos;t always go smoothly. Sometimes people are at a new ATM and not familiar with the menu, or they have several transactions. Sometimes at the grocery check out there&apos;s a trainee having a problem with a customer who wants to write a check. Sometimes people are trying a new fast food joint for lunch so they have to take a minute to look at the menu. Or someone is on there way somewhere and buyings snacks for a group so it takes a little longer. It&apos;s called real life and real people. They don&apos;t have to follow a set of rules you made up and they&apos;e not schmucks because they interfered with your routine. We&apos;ve created this hurry up society and the result is bad attitudes like yours.

My frustration stems from my taking the time to be prepared and having to suffer through someone who is not because they couldn&apos;t be bothered to take the 3 seconds to think things through beforehand. Their lack of action shows a disregard and disrespect for everyone around them. Are there worse ways to show it? Sure, but the statement made in line is the same made if they&apos;d deliberately cut me off on the highway.

I agree a car full of people who are undecided about what they want should go inside instead of discuss it at the menu board but I know that happens occasionaly. If I decide to take 30 seconds or more to consider any new items on the menu or to remind myself what they have because I only come through twice a year then I&apos;m not being discourteous to anyone. Expecting everyone to have decided and be ready when they get there is unrealistic.

And, frustration is a perfectly acceptable response. I don&apos;t shout obsenities or honk my horn or flip them off. I don&apos;t drag them out of their car and beat them senseless. I see no wrong with becoming frustrated because some asshole refuses to offer me the same courtesy I offer them.
You definition of courtesy is skewed. Courtesy does not demand that everyone be perfectly prepared every time they do anything that involves other people. Courtesy isn&apos;t about saving time. It&apos;s about dealing with people. Patience can be a part of courtesy. I began to notice how much I was buying in to the&quot;hurry up&quot;culture and I&apos;ve made a change. If someone on front of me has a problem and takes longer I won&apos;t get frustrated. I help if I can and wait patiently if I can&apos;t. If they apologize then I smile and say&quot;No Problem, no need to rush&quot;
If I don&apos;t have time to wait then I just go on my way without blaming anyone. It&apos;s just life and stuff happens.

And the rule of common courtesy is that you do unto others as you would have done unto you. Courtesy usually means two people interacting with each other. Sitting in the car behind someone is not interacting with them. It is considerate to be aware that others are waiting but people gauge how long is too long differently. Your exteme is one end of the spectrum.

Regardless, it is not a complicated procedure. There is absolutely no reason for a person to take more than the time it takes to speak your order. If they have 86 cents and don&apos;t know what they can get for 86 cents, go inside. If they have a coupon, mention it while ordering, not at the window. If their wallet is difficult to reach, get it out beforehand. They aren&apos;t a whole lot to ask and in the end they save everyone time. But people can&apos;t be bothered with anything outside of their own little self-centered world.

Certainly there are many self centered people in the world. I&apos;ve even noticed some folks seem to think being oblivious of others is a form of self esteem or personal pride. The&quot;it&apos;s all about me and what I want&quot;syndrome. However, the statement I bolded is just a ridiculous standard that only serves to keep you frustrated and critical of others.


The definition I use is summarized in the dictionary as: 1 a : producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect.

Taking their time is neither decided, decisive, nor desired. The desire is to move the line as quickly as possible. Again we come to what is a reasonable amount of time? Customers who frequent the place and know exactly what they want take less time than customers who only come once in a great while and have to read the menu or groups.

That it is not their concern is exactly the problem. They have no common courtesy. If they did, they&apos;d give a rat&apos;s ass about the world outside their own personal microcosm and realize that their actions are inconveniencing others. There&apos;s a thing called balance. If the guy behind me only has a half hour for lunch thats not my fault. There&apos;s no rule of courtesy that requires me to hurry and get something I don&apos;t really want because he forgot to bring lunch.
On Sat. when I have a only a half hour for lunch I bring lunch. It&apos;s my responsibility to deal with my own schedule not someone elses. If I find myself cussing under my breath because I&apos;m running a little late and the driver in front of me is going 5 miles an hour under the speed limit, that&apos;s my failure not theirs. cabdude 08-17-2005, 07:02 PM DON&apos;T WAIT FOR THE TRANSLATION!!
