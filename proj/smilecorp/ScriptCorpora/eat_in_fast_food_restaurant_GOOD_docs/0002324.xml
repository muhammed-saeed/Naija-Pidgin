 Displaying 1 - 5 of 5 Reviews Found Sort: Useful | Helpful | Reviews | Date Best hotdog bargain downtown By thirdperson of Vancouver (4 Reviews) Submitted Thursday, November 24, 2011 - 8:32am [Dine in] 
Located near stadium skytrain station, this Costco cafetaria is outside the store and accessible for non-members. Best buy is $1.50+ for giant hotdog and unlimited soft drinks combo. Your choice of beef or European hotdog. Free mustard, relish, ketchup, garlic and pepper pieces. A similar hotdog alone would cost $3.00+ at street vendors downtown. Other bargains are the ice cream and fries or poutines in large portions. Pizza and fried chicken are available too. At the takeout counter, customer service is fast and efficient with lineups common. Ambiance isn&apos;t pretty or comfortable but there are tables if you don&apos;t mind dining outside and a view of hockey arena across the street. Overall, incredible deals here.

 Inexpensive, Big Portions, Unhealthy By thecritic of Vancouver (305 Reviews) Submitted Wednesday, April 7, 2010 - 2:22pm [Dine in] 
If you are looking for a place to get a lot of food for cheap and you&apos;re not very health conscious, this is the place for you. They have a variety of items to choose from including pizza, sandwiches, poutine, hotdogs, etc. They also have a decent patio so you can sit outside and eat your food but its overlooking Expo Boulevard next to GM Place so there isn&apos;t much to look at except traffic. I sometimes get cravings for their poutine which is a massive amount of food for less than 5 bucks but I usually feel like I need a salad after.

 patio dining? By chasiubow of North Van (675 Reviews) Submitted Thursday, May 7, 2009 - 7:42pm [Dine in] 
Mrs. C and I found ourselves at Costco and we wanted to get some food to take home to eat while watching hockey. Surprisingly, the place was deserted, so there was no lineup. Ambiance was good compared to other Costco locations. The place was reasonably clean, and the tables were arranged in neat rows to increase efficiency. This restaurant has one other virtue: You don&apos;t need to fish out your card in order to get in since there is direct street access to the restaurant. That&apos;s right, all you non-members can eat without buying a membership!

Service was perfunctory as usual, and alas they do not sell the ribs at this location. Luckily they had the Angus burger, so we got a couple of those and enough fries to feed a whole village along with the usual vats of iced tea. All were tasty and a terrific value. There is a giant roll-up door that exposes one side of the restaurant, so you can watch the passing parade of cops and scruffians along the boulevard. If you are heading to GM Place or stepping on the nearby Skytrain, it is worth a try.

 Quick snack while DT By DrNo of Main St. Vancouver (7 Reviews) Submitted Monday, March 15, 2010 - 7:42pm [Dine in] 
Was in the mood for a quick bite after perusing some of the deals inside. Usual choice of hot dog and drink for $2, you can&apos;t go wrong. Only thing here is the lack of condiments compared to other Costco locations. No peppers, no kraut, though they did have onions in small plastic containers. Not quite as good without all the goods!

Service was quick although there was a long line when I went into the warehouse initially. Ambiance was alright, at least you&apos;re outside.

 Cheaper than a Hot Dog vendor, that&apos;s for sure. By unisushi of Vancouver (6 Reviews) Submitted Wednesday, June 30, 2010 - 12:17am [Dine in] 
I got a hot dog post-Costco shopping last week. Note that there may be a parking fee associated with coming here if you&apos;re driving. The parking downstairs in the Costco parkade is $2 for 2 hours (reasonable), there&apos;s metered parking right by the Costco entrance and some free parking available 2-3 blocks away.

It was $1.99 for my hot dog and pop.

*That* is ridiculously cheap.

I enjoyed my hot dog which I filled at the condiment counter with ketchup, mustard, relish and small cup of onions. The soda was okay - not too watered down.

So the bad thing is, that the napkins weren&apos;t stocked. They were there - like all 10 of them - but they were in such a disarray that I wasn&apos;t sure if it was a garbage bin or whatnot.

I went back for a $2 ice cream cone. It was delicious.
