Design functional and attractive parking lots

Gus van der Hoeven
 
Standing on the eighth floor of a downtown building, I looked out the
window on a featureless parking lot filled with what seemed like match-box
cars parked bumper to bumper. It was an ugly site. However, I also recall a
different parking lot full of trees and flowers--an attractive place. The
difference was in good planning for the fact that cars are part of everyday
life. Increasingly we see underground parking and parking garages address
the issue of vehicle storage. These compact multi-floor buildings fit in
the urban infrastructure quite well. However, large asphalt and concrete
parking lots are often unsightly.

Planning a good parking lot
Each parking-lot design must first consider the safety factor. The parking
lot is a place where the driver and passengers become pedestrians the
moment they leave the car. Thus, pedestrians should have a clear indication
of where it is safe to walk. Clear traffic flow is important so drivers
follow a planned pattern as they look for a parking spot. In many parking
lots, the roadway for cars is also the pedestrian walkway and the two don&apos;t
mix. Therefore, safe sidewalks that lead the pedestrian from the car to the
building or entrance are important.
