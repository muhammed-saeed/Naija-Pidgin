 I received some time ago several letters asking about the name of God.&quot;Is Allah the name of God or the name of a god/demon?&quot;Several people thought that the name of Allah, linked to Islam, is the God of Islam or the bad god.

My answer was:

1- The Name of Allah is the name of the true God:

a- The Moslems worship the true God who has been the God of the Ancient and New Testament. They confess that&quot;in order to be a good Moslem, you have to be a good Jew and a good Christian&quot;, a statement of confessing to the truth of the other two religions.
b- The name of Allah was taking by the Moslems from the Christians who existed five centuries before the arrival of Islam. Arabs were mentioned in the book of Acts at the time of the Pentecost.

c- The existence of bad elements in any country or religion does not make that religion bad and hence does not make all moslems bad or all jews or chritians bad. People become bad when they do not follow the teaching of their religion.

d- Beauty and Truth is One. All religions reflect the beauty of God in a certain way and so does the Islam.

e- Moslems teach us that there are 99 names for Allah and that the 100th name is hidden. These names are adjectives of God and do not tell us the true entity of God.The 100th name may be the one that really is the name of God.

2- The Name of Allah is the same as the name of Elohim:
a- In the Semetic languages Vowels do not count. Consonants form the words. These consonants are not written because they are not important and they do make the word sick and ill. So if we look at the name of Allah and the name of Elohim we will find the following:
Allah = L + H, Elohim = L+H+M (we will ignore the M and come back to it later).
b- In the Semetic languages, word roots are formed of three letters. It was found later on that these three letters were formed of two two-letter verbs. A complete study was made by several scholars among which is Fr. Marmarji S.J. in Lebanon.
c- L+H= LH (pronounced&apos;lahh&apos;) means&quot;to him&quot;. God, Allah or Yahweh is not the name of God, Allah and Yahweh. God is not the name. He exists and no one knows his name. If we know His name then we will possess Him and understand Him, then He is not God the Omnopotents the Existant etc..
d- So instead we say&quot;to Him&quot;be the glory.&quot;To Him&quot;be the praise Look at the book of Revelation 5:13: Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. It is safe to say that instead of saying God you can say&quot;To Him&quot;

e- Till our present day, Christians and Moslems replace the name of God with&quot;Taala&quot;(pronounced&apos;Tah-ah-lah&apos;) the excelsior, the most high.

3- Moses and the Name of Yahweh
a- Moses did not know the name of God even several hundred years after Abraham who is supposed to have known God and became the friend of God. Moses is from the descendents of Abraham, he is the leader and yet he did not know Him. The story is known where Moses says what is your name so I may tell them. God said&quot;Yehyeh Asher Yehyeh&quot;that means be who it be. He may have said I be who I am, or it is not your business to know my name. God definitely did not reveal his name to Moses. Moses used the verb to be in order to denote God, hence the word&quot;existent&quot;came to play a role. You have to know that the word of God when uttered does not go out in vain, it has to produce something. The&quot;existent&quot;has a triple chronological dimention in the semetic language. It means he who was, he who is and he who will be.Revelation again mentions these three dimentions.
b- The name got deformed adonai

4-Is it possible to know the name of God?
Knowing a name or naming something means you are in command.
Adam names of all the animals (Gen 2:19) because God gave him power over all of them (Gen. 1:26). The father always gives the name to his sons indicating the power over children. God changes the names of Abraham and Sarah. He tells him to call his son Isaac.

Remember also:&quot;You are my son, today I have called you.&quot;. When the name of the Lord is called. You are calling the person of the Lord.

That&apos;s why it is impossible for man to grasp God and understand Him. He is out of our reach. Knowing His real name is grasping Him.

On the other hand, we use the names God, Theos, Allah, Elohim to denote an entity that is&apos;&quot;To Him&quot;be the glory&apos;. A name is not enough to denote His power and glory etc..

5- Elohim
Elohim is the Hebrew name for Allah with the exception that it has an&quot;M&quot;at the end.&quot;M&quot;indicates the plural. And plural could indicate one of the following:
a- plural of respect. Addressing a person with plural denotes respect. A king, a prince, a president are all addressed in president. You find that in Arabic, French, Italian etc.. (It is self explanatory).

b- plural of plurality of Gods despite the belief in one God, the people of Israel continued to worship several gods. They worshiped the golden calf (Exodus 32:4), the Baal and Ashtaroth (Judges 2:13) others&quot;the foolish&quot;said there is no God. That&apos;s why they were worshiping the gods, the&quot;elohim&quot;not the&quot;eloh&quot;. It is amazing how the sons of Abraham who is the worshiper of the One God have stayed polytheist for a long time.

Finally, the name of the one and only God, became the name of the plural of gods. Theologically now:&quot;Elohim&quot;is the name of the Only and One God.

c- Plurality of the persons (out of revelation) The Lord appeared in the form of three men and Abram addressed them as a singular.(Gen 18). We know now that God is one in three persons through the revelation of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Since the Bible is a revelation, then we have the knowledge of the person of God even through the layers of the Old Testament.

Conclusion
Our conflict on what God, Allah, Yahweh should be called in a futile conflict that revolves around something superficial that would never define the name of God which is the nature of God.
No language can say that they have the true name of the Entity that created the world. All what we can do is say&quot;To Him&quot;be the glory. Amen
Allah is the Arabic language word referring to&quot;God&quot;,&quot;the Lord&quot;and, literally according to the Qur&apos;an, to the&quot;God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&quot;in the Abrahamic religions. It does not mean&quot;a god&quot;, but rather&quot;the Only God&quot;, the Supreme Creator of the universe, and it is the main term for the deity in Islam. However,&quot;Allah&quot;is not restricted to just Islam, and used by Christians and Jews according to geographic region.

Allāh is found in the Qur&apos;an and in Arabic translations of both the Tanakh and the Gospels and even in the Indonesian translations of the Bible. Christians believe that Allāh is ath-Thalouth al-Muqaddas - The Holy Trinity, thus whole Allāh is consisted from Abu-Father, Bin-Son, and Ruh-Spirit.

Outside the Arabic World, the use of&quot;Allāh&quot;is generally associated exclusively with Islam, and is used to refer specifically to the Islamic concept of God. It is nearly the same as the Jewish conception of a single God,[1][2] but differs from the Trinitarian Christian conception of God. In Islam, the concept of one God is strictly observed. The Qu&apos;ran refers to a Jewish belief in Ezra as the Son of GodQuran 9:30, although historical Judaism is also strictly monotheistic.

Islamic scholars often translate&quot;Allāh&quot;directly into English as&quot;God&quot;, especially Qur&apos;an alone Muslims. Other scholars feel that&quot;Allāh&quot;should not be translated arguing that&quot;Allāh&quot;is the term for&quot;the Only God&quot;in a glorified pronunciation. This is a significant issue when translating the Qur&apos;an.

According to the tradition of Islam there are 99 Names of God. They are the names of God revealed in the Qur&apos;an.[3]

[edit] Etymology
The word Allāh (ألله) is derived from a contraction of the Arabic words al- (the) and ʾilāh (deity, masculine form) — al-ilāh meaning&quot;the god&quot;. Cognates of the name&quot;Allāh&quot;exist in other Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic.

Muslim and non-Muslim scholars often translate&quot;Allāh&quot;directly into English as&quot;God&quot;; and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians refer to Allāh as God. Also, it is believed that in Islam,&quot;Allāh&quot;means the same God that the people of Christianity and Judaism faith believe in; in other words, the three prominent religions believe in the same God. However, some Muslim scholars feel that&quot;Allāh&quot;should not be translated, because they perceive the Arabic word to express the uniqueness of&quot;Allāh&quot;more accurately than the word&quot;god&quot;, which can take a plural&quot;gods&quot;, whereas the word&quot;Allāh&quot;has no plural form. This is a significant issue in translation of the Qur&apos;an.

The word&quot;Allāh&quot;had been used in the Arabic tongue in the Jāhilīyah (pre-Islamic) period; it occurs in Arabic classical poetry and was also used by Jews in certain regions (for cognate Hebrew Elōah), as well as by the pagan tribes in the Arabian peninsula to signify a chief deity.[citation needed]

Along with Allāh, the pre-Islamic Arabs believed in a host of other terms to signify gods, such as Hubal and al-Lāt, al-`Uzzah, and Manah.[4] Pre-Islamic Jews referred to their supreme creator as Yahweh or Elohim. This view of Allāh by the pre-Islamic pagans is viewed by Muslims as a later development having arisen as a result of moving away from Abrahamic monotheism over time since the building of the Kaaba. In the Qur&apos;an, Muhammad orally transmits a rebuttal to this common belief at the time in the verse&quot;17:40 Has then your Lord (O Pagans!) preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters among the angels? Truly ye utter a most dreadful saying!&quot;. Secular historians, meanwhile, have postulated that monotheism is the result of an evolution from henotheism, the belief in a supreme deity as well as various lesser divinities. (See Judaism.) The pagan Arabians also used the word&quot;Allāh&quot;in the names of their children; Muhammad&apos;s father, who was born into pagan society, was named&quot;Abdullāh&quot;, which translates&quot;servant of Allāh&quot;.&quot;Abdullāh&quot;is still used for names of Muslim and non-Muslims (e.g. Christians also used the word, as testified by the Zabad inscription).&quot;Abdullāh&quot;was also the name of the father of Maimon, whose son Moses is the Jewish principal Rabbi commonly known in English as Maimonides. Maimonides wrote his works mostly in Arabic on which his name appear as&quot;Mūsa bin Maimūn bin `Abdullāh al-Qurţubī&quot;( موسى بن ميمون بن عبد الله القرطبي ) =&quot;Moses son of Maimon son of Abdullah, of Cordoba&quot;.

The Hebrew word for deity, El (אל) or Elōah (אלוה, rarely אלה), was used as an Old Testament synonym for Yahweh (יהוה), which is the proper name for God according to the Tanakh. The Aramaic word for God is אלהא Elāhā (Biblical Aramaic) and ܐܠܗܐ Alāhā (Syriac), which comes from the same Proto-Semitic word (*ʾil-) as the Arabic and Hebrew terms; Jesus is described in Mark 15:34 as having used the word on the cross, with the ending meaning&quot;my&quot;, when saying,&quot;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&quot;(transliterated in Greek as ἐλωι elō-i). One of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a Greek translation of the Shahada, from 86-96 AH (705-715 AD), which translates it as ὁ θεος μονος (ho theos monos),[5] literally&quot;the lone god&quot;.


[edit] Typography

An example of allāh written in simple Arabic calligraphy.The word Allāh is always written without an alif to spell the ā vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell ā. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate the pronunciation.

One exception may be in the pre-Islamic Zabad inscription, where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing h with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined l-h:-

as الاه : This reading would be Allāh spelled phonetically with alif for the ā.
as الاله : This reading would be Al-&apos;ilāh =&quot;the god&quot;, uncontracted, by older spelling practice without alif for ā.
The form in the inscription is shown at.[6]

Unicode has a glyph reserved for Allāh, ﷲ‎ = U+FDF2, which can be combined with an alif to yield the post-consonantal form, اﷲ‎, as opposed to the full spelling alif-lām-lām-hā الله‎ which may be rendered slightly differently, in particular featuring a diacritic alif on top of the shadda. In this, Unicode imitates traditional Arabic typesetting, which also frequently featured special llāh types.

In Abjad numerals, The Name Of Allah (الله) numeric value is 66.

The calligraphic variant of the word used as the Coat of arms of Iran is encoded in Unicode, in the Miscellaneous Symbols range, at codepoint U+262B (☫).

[edit] History

Allah script outside Eski Cami (The Old Mosque) in Edirne, Turkey.This view of Allāh by the pre-Islamic pagans is viewed by Muslims as a later development having arisen as a result of moving away from Abrahamic monotheism over time. Some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of Noah, whom later generations first revered as saints, and then transformed into gods. The pagan Arabians also used the word&quot;Allāh&quot;in the names of their children; Muhammad&apos;s father, who was born into pagan society, was named&quot;Abdullah&quot;, which means&quot;servant of Allāh&quot;. Abdullah is still used for names of Muslim and non-Muslim Arabs.

The Hebrew word for deity, El (אל) or Elōah (אלוה), was used as an Old Testament synonym for the Tetragrammaton (יהוה), which is the proper name of God according to the Hebrew Bible. The Aramaic word for God is alôh-ô (Syriac dialect) or elâhâ (Biblical dialect), which comes from the same Proto-Semitic word (*ʾilâh-) as the Arabic and Hebrew terms; Jesus is described in Mark 15:34 as having used the word on the cross, with the ending meaning&quot;my&quot;, when saying,&quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;(transliterated in Greek as elō-i).

One of the earliest surviving translations of the word Allāh into a foreign language is in a Greek translation of the Shahada, from 86-96 AH (705-715 AD), which translates it as ho theos monos,[7] literally&quot;the one god&quot;. Also the cognate Aramaic term appears in the Aramaic version of the New Testament, called the Pshitta (or Peshitta) as one of the words Jesus used to refer to God, e.g., in the sixth Beatitude,&quot;Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see Alaha.&quot;And in the Arabic Bible the same words:&quot;طُوبَى لأَنْقِيَاءِ الْقَلْبِ، فَإِنَّهُمْ سَيَرَوْنَ الله&quot;


[edit] Debates in popular media
While it is customary for people to use the word in their own language for&quot;God,&quot;e.g. the Japanese use (神様) pronounced as&quot;Kami Sama,&quot;and French use Le Dieu (or Dieu), a feverish debate about reference to&quot;God&quot;in the Tanakh and the Gospels using the Arabic Qur&apos;an term&quot;Allāh&quot;has been waged in the aftermath of September 11th (begun in the United States and followed by repercussions in most of Western Europe). It has been particularly associated with the televangelist and media producer Jerry Falwell, and the televangelists Franklin Graham and Pat Robertson, who hosts the 700 Club.[8]

The 700 Club presented Ergun Caner, an ex-Muslim and a native of Turkey. Soon after, Jerry Falwell formally recruited Caner to speak at conferences. Recently Caner has been appointed dean of the Liberty Theological Seminary in Lynchburg, VA., which was founded by Jerry Falwell.[9] From his new position, Caner further proclaimed not only is Allāh not the God of the Bible, but Allāh is not God,[10] a proclamation that met and exceeded the televangelist&apos;s expectations. Consequently, Jerry Falwell can now state that&quot;Allāh is not God&quot;without fear of repercussions.


[edit] Other beliefs
Jews for Allah is an unofficial group of Muslim former Jews who convert Jews to Islam.
The Nation of Gods and Earths, one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the United States, holds that the word Allāh is the name of the original black man and stands for&quot;Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head&quot;,[11][12] which is an English abbreviation. As the word Allāh is universally understood to be an Arabic term, those familiar with the origins and history of Arabic and English would consider this a false etymology. This concept also differs dramatically from mainstream Islam thought which strictly opposes any attempt to portray Allāh as a human or in any other way.
The Bahá&apos;í Faith, whose scriptures are primarily written in Arabic and Persian, also uses Allāh to mean God, though typical practice is to use the customary word for God in the language being spoken. In certain specific uses Allāh is not translated, rather the whole Arabic phrase is used. The chief example of this would be the customary Bahá&apos;í greeting Alláh&apos;u&apos;abhá, which is commonly translated as God is the All Glorious. They also believe that Allāh should not have any pictures drawn of him.

[edit] Allah outside Islam
Most Arabic-speaking Christian and Jewish Communities (including the Yemenite Jews, several Mizraḥi communities and some Sephardim) use&quot;Allāh&quot;as the proper noun for&quot;God&quot;. Etymologically, the name Allah is probably a contraction of the Arabic al-Ilah, “the God.” The name&apos;s origin can be traced back to the earliest Semitic writings in which the word for god was Il or El, the latter being an Old Testament synonym for Yahweh. Allah is the standard Arabic word for “God” and is used by Arab Christians as well.[13]
.&quot;If God created everything - then who created God?&quot;

Answer:

(Muslims - Remember to use the formula above - i.e.;&quot;Thank you for asking me about my religion...&quot;etc.)

According to the Quran, Allah tells us that He is the only creator and sustainer of all that exists and that nothing and no one exists alongside Him, nor does He have any partners. He tells us that He is not created, nor is He like His creation in anyway. He calls Himself by a number of names and three of them are:

A) The First - (Al-Awal)
B) The Last - (Al Akhir)
C) The Eternal, who is sought after by His creation, while He has no need from them at all. (As-Samad)
He always has existed and He never was created, as He is not like His creation, nor similar to it, in any way.

2.&quot;How can you believe in God, when you can&apos;t see, hear, touch, smell, taste or even imagine what He is?&quot;

Answer:

We know from the teachings of Muhammad, peace be upon him, that no one has ever actually seen God - at least not in this lifetime. Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize that all of this universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Something had to design it all and then put it into motion. That is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something that we can understand.
We don&apos;t have to see an artist to recognize a painting, correct? So, if we see paintings without seeing artists painting them, in the same way, we can believe that Allah created everything without having to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.).

3.&quot;Can God do anything? - For example:&quot;Can He make a rock so big that nothing can move it?&quot;- If He did make a rock so big that nothing could move it, would that mean that He couldn&apos;t move it too? Or would it be impossible for Him to make something so big that He couldn&apos;t move it?&quot;

Answer:
Allah tells us that&quot;Allah is capable of doing anything that He Wills to do.&quot;He can make a rock (or anything for that matter) that is so large or heavy that nothing in the entire universe can move it. As regards Allah&quot;moving&quot;it, He is not in the universe and He does not resemble His creation. Therefore, Allah is never subject to the Laws of the Creation because He is both the Creator and the Law Giver. Whenever He wants anything done, He merely says&quot;Qun! Faya Qun!&quot;(Be! And so it will be!)

4.&quot;Where is God?&quot;

Answer:
Some other religions teach that&quot;God is everywhere.&quot;This is actually called&quot;pantheism&quot;and it is the opposite of our believe system in Islam. Allah tells us clearly that there is nothing, anywhere in the universe that resembles Him, nor is He ever in His creation. He tells us in the Quran that He created the universe in six&quot;yawm&quot;(periods of time) and then He&quot;astawah&apos;ala al Arsh&quot;(rose up, above His Throne). He is there (above His Throne) and will remain there until the End Times.

5.&quot;Why did God create everything?&quot;

Answer:
Allah says in His Quran that He did not create all of this for any foolish purpose. He tells us that He created us for the purpose of worshiping Him, Alone and without any partners.

6.&quot;Is God pure, good, loving and fair? - If so, then where does evil, hatred and injustice come from?&quot;

Answer:
Allah tells us that He is Pure, Loving, and absolutely Just in every respect. He says that He is the Best of Judges. He also tells us that the life that we are in is a test. He has created all the things that exist and He has created all that happens as well. There is nothing in this existence except what He has created. He also says in the Quran that He created evil (although He is not evil). He is using this as one of the many tests for us.

7.&quot;Does God really have power of things? - If so, then why does He let people become sick, oppressed and die?&quot;

Answer:
Allah has created all that we call the universe as a test for us. This is not our final destination. What we might consider to be&quot;bad&quot;or&quot;good&quot;could actually be quite the opposite. As regards oppression, this is something that Allah forbids for Himself to do to anyone and He hates it when anyone oppresses someone else. He does have absolute power over everything. He allows sickness, disease, death and even oppression so that we can all be tested in what we do.

8.&quot;Can you prove there is a God?&quot;

Answer:
Can you prove that you exist? Yes, of course you can. You merely use your senses to determine that you can see, hear, feel, smell, taste and you have emotions as well. All of this is a part of your existence. But this is not how we perceive God in Islam. We can look to the things that He has created and the way that He cares for things and sustains us, to know that there is no doubt of His existence.

Think about this the next time that you are looking up at the moon or the stars on a clear night; could you drop a drinking glass on the sidewalk and expect that it would hit the ground and on impact it would not shatter, but it would divide up into little small drinking glasses, with iced tea in them? Of course not.

And then consider if a tornado came through a junkyard and tore through the old cars; would it leave behind a nice new Mercedes with the engine running and no parts left around? Naturally not.

Can a fast food restaurant operate itself without any people there? That&apos;s crazy for anyone to even think about.

After considering all of the above, how could we look to the universe above us through a telescope or observe the molecules in a microscope and then think that all of this came about as a result of a&quot;big bang&quot;or some&quot;accident?&quot;

(see also&quot;Quran&quot;)

9.&quot;Does God know everything that is going to happen? - Does He have absolute control on the outcome of everything? - If so, how is that fair for us? Where is our free will then?&quot;

Answer:
Allah Knows everything that will happen. The first thing that He created was the&quot;pen&quot;and He ordered the pen to write. The pen wrote until it had written everything that would happen. And then Allah began to create the universe. All of this was already known to Him before He created it. He does have absolute and total control at all times. There is nothing that happens except that He is in control of if.
There is a mistake in the question:&quot;Free Will.&quot;Allah alone, has Free Will, He Wills whatever He likes and it will always happen as He wills. We have something called,&quot;Free choice.&quot;The difference is that what Allah&quot;Wills&quot;always happens and what we choose may or may not happen. We are not being judged on the outcome of things, we are being judged on our choices. This means that at the core of everything will always be our intentions. Whatever we intended, is what we will have the reward for. Each person will be judged according to what Allah gave them to work with, how they used it and what they intended to do with it.

As regards the actual&quot;Judgment Day&quot;- Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom&apos;s weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom&apos;s weight of evil will be seen too.

The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.

He could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.

Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don&apos;t. That is why the test is fair.

10.&quot;If there is only one God, then why are there so many religions?

Answer:
Allah does not force anyone to submit to Him. He has layed out a clear path and then made it known to them the two ways (Heaven or Hell). The person is always free to make his or her own choice. There is not complusion in the way of&quot;Islam.&quot;Whoever choses to worship Allah without partners and is devoted to Him and is obeying His commands as much as possible, has grasped the firm handhold that will never break. Whoever denies God and choses some other way to worship or not to believe at all, for them there is an eternal punishment that is most horrible (Hell).

All religions originated with Allah and then people began to add or take away from the teachings so as to take control over each other. Man made religions are an abomination before the Lord and will never be accepted. He will only accept true submission, obedience and in purity and peace to His commandments.

11.&quot;How do you know that the Quran is really from God?&quot;

Answer:

Muslims have something that offers the most clear proof of all - The Holy Quran. There is no other book like it anywhere on earth. It is absolutely perfect in the Arabic language. It has no mistakes in grammar, meanings or context. The scientific evidences are well known around the entire world, even amongst non-Muslim scholars. Predictions in the Quran have come true; and its teachings are clearly for all people, all places and all times. No one has been able to produce a book like it, nor ten chapters like it, nor even one chapter like it. It was memorized by thousands of people during the lifetime of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and then this memorization was passed down from teacher to student for generation after generation, from mouth to ear and from one nation to another. Today every single Muslim has memorized some part of the Quran in the original Arabic language that it was revealed in over 1,400 years ago, even though most of them are not Arabs. There are over nine million (9,000,000) Muslims living on the earth today who have totally memorized the entire Quran, word for word, and can recite the entire Quran, in Arabic just as Muhammad, peace be upon him, did 14 centuries ago.

12.&quot;Why does it say&quot;WE&quot;in Quran when referring to God (Allah)?&quot;

Answer:

This is a good question and one that Bible readers have also asked about. The term&quot;We&quot;in the Bible and in the Quran is the royal&quot;We&quot;- as an example when the king says,&quot;We decree the following declaration, etc.&quot;or,&quot;We are not amused.&quot;It does not indicate plural; rather it displays the highest position in the language. English, Persian, Hebrew, Arabic and many languages provide for the usage of&quot;We&quot;for the royal figure. It is helpful to note the same dignity is given to the person being spoken to in English. We say to someone,&quot;You ARE my friend.&quot;Yet the person is only one person standing there. Why did we say&quot;ARE&quot;instead of&quot;IS&quot;? The noun&quot;you&quot;is singular and should therefore be associated with a singular verb for the state of being, yet we say,&quot;are.&quot;The same is true for the speaker when referring to himself or herself. We say,&quot;I am&quot;and this is also in the royal plural, instead of saying,&quot;I is.&quot;

13.&quot;Why does Quran say&quot;He&quot;when referring to God (Allah) if God is not having gender?&quot;

Answer:

This is similar to the above answer. The word&quot;He&quot;is used when referring to Allah out of respect, dignity and high status. It would be totally inappropriate to use the word&quot;it&quot;and would not convey the proper understanding of Allah being who Allah is; Alive, Compassionate, Forgiving, Patient, Loving, etc. It is not correct to associate the word&quot;He&quot;with gender, as this would be comparing Allah to the creation, something totally against the teaching of Quran.
The religion of Islam has as its focus of worship a deity by the name of&quot;Allah.&quot;The Muslims claim that Allah in pre-Islamic times was the biblical God of the Patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. The issue is thus one of continuity. Was&quot;Allah&quot;the biblical God or a pagan god in Arabia during pre-Islamic times? The Muslim&apos;s claim of continuity is essential to their attempt to convert Jews and Christians for if&quot;Allah&quot;is part of the flow of divine revelation in Scripture, then it is the next step in biblical religion. Thus we should all become Muslims. But, on the other hand, if Allah was a pre-Islamic pagan deity, then its core claim is refuted. Religious claims often fall before the results of hard sciences such as archeology. We can endlessly speculate about the past or go and dig it up and see what the evidence reveals. This is the only way to find out the truth concerning the origins of Allah. As we shall see, the hard evidence demonstrates that the god Allah was a pagan deity. In fact, he was the Moon-god who was married to the sun goddess and the stars were his daughters.

Archeologists have uncovered temples to the Moon-god throughout the Middle East. From the mountains of Turkey to the banks of the Nile, the most wide-spread religion of the ancient world was the worship of the Moon-god. In the first literate civilization, the Sumerians have left us thousands of clay tablets in which they described their religious beliefs. As demonstrated by Sjoberg and Hall, the ancient Sumerians worshipped a Moon-god who was called many different names. The most popular names were Nanna, Suen and Asimbabbar. His symbol was the crescent moon. Given the amount of artifacts concerning the worship of this Moon-god, it is clear that this was the dominant religion in Sumeria. The cult of the Moon-god was the most popular religion throughout ancient Mesopotamia. The Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Akkadians took the word Suen and transformed it into the word Sin as their favorite name for the Moon-god. As Prof. Potts pointed out,&quot;Sin is a name essentially Sumerian in origin which had been borrowed by the Semites.&quot;

In ancient Syria and Canna, the Moon-god Sin was usually represented by the moon in its crescent phase. At times the full moon was placed inside the crescent moon to emphasize all the phases of the moon. The sun-goddess was the wife of Sin and the stars were their daughters. For example, Istar was a daughter of Sin. Sacrifices to the Moon-god are described in the Pas Shamra texts. In the Ugaritic texts, the Moon-god was sometimes called Kusuh. In Persia, as well as in Egypt, the Moon-god is depicted on wall murals and on the heads of statues. He was the Judge of men and gods. The Old Testament constantly rebuked the worship of the Moon-god (see: Deut. 4:19;17:3; II Kngs. 21:3,5; 23:5; Jer. 8:2; 19:13; Zeph. 1:5, etc.) When Israel fell into idolatry, it was usually the cult of the Moon-god.

As a matter of fact, everywhere in the ancient world, the symbol of the crescent moon can be found on seal impressions, steles, pottery, amulets, clay tablets, cylinders, weights, earrings, necklaces, wall murals, etc. In Tell-el-Obeid, a copper calf was found with a crescent moon on its forehead. An idol with the body of a bull and the head of man has a crescent moon inlaid on its forehead with shells. In Ur, the Stela of Ur-Nammu has the crescent symbol placed at the top of the register of gods because the Moon-god was the head of the gods. Even bread was baked in the form of a crescent as an act of devotion to the Moon-god. The Ur of the Chaldees was so devoted to the Moon-god that it was sometimes called Nannar in tablets from that time period.

A temple of the Moon-god has been excavated in Ur by Sir Leonard Woolley. He dug up many examples of moon worship in Ur and these are displayed in the British Museum to this day. Harran was likewise noted for its devotion to the Moon-god. In the 1950&apos;s a major temple to the Moon-god was excavated at Hazer in Palestine. Two idols of the moon god were found. Each was a stature of a man sitting upon a throne with a crescent moon carved on his chest . The accompanying inscriptions make it clear that these were idols of the Moon-god. Several smaller statues were also found which were identified by their inscriptions as the&quot;daughters&quot;of the Moon-god. What about Arabia? As pointed out by Prof. ****,&quot;Muslims are notoriously loath to preserve traditions of earlier paganism and like to garble what pre-Islamic history they permit to survive in anachronistic terms.&quot;

During the nineteenth century, Amaud, Halevy and Glaser went to Southern Arabia and dug up thousands of Sabean, Minaean, and Qatabanian inscriptions which were subsequently translated. In the 1940&apos;s, the archeologists G. Caton Thompson and Carleton S. **** made some amazing discoveries in Arabia. During the 1950&apos;s, Wendell Phillips, W.F.
Albright, Richard Bower and others excavated sites at Qataban, Timna, and Marib (the ancient capital of Sheba). Thousands of inscriptions from walls and rocks in Northern Arabia have also been collected. Reliefs and votive bowls used in worship of the&quot;daughters of Allah&quot;have also been discovered. The three daughters, al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat are sometimes depicted together with Allah the Moon-god represented by a crescent moon above them. The archeological evidence demonstrates that the dominant religion of Arabia was the cult of the Moon-god.

In Old Testament times, Nabonidus (555-539 BC), the last king of Babylon, built Tayma, Arabia as a center of Moon-god worship. Segall stated,&quot;South Arabia&apos;s stellar religion has always been dominated by the Moon-god in various variations.&quot;Many scholars have also noticed that the Moon-god&apos;s name&quot;Sin&quot;is a part of such Arabic words as&quot;Sinai,&quot;the&quot;wilderness of Sin,&quot;etc. When the popularity of the Moon-god waned elsewhere, the Arabs remained true to their conviction that the Moon-god was the greatest of all gods. While they worshipped 360 gods at the Kabah in Mecca, the Moon-god was the chief deity. Mecca was in fact built as a shrine for the Moon-god. This is what made it the most sacred site of Arabian paganism. In 1944,
G. Caton Thompson revealed in her book, The Tombs and Moon Temple of Hureidha, that she had uncovered a temple of the Moon-god in southern Arabia. The symbols of the crescent moon and no less than twenty-one inscriptions with the name Sin were found in this temple. An idol which may be the Moon-god himself was also discovered. This was later confirmed by other well-known archeologists.

The evidence reveals that the temple of the Moon-god was active even in the Christian era. Evidence gathered from both North and South Arabia demonstrate that Moon-god worship was clearly active even in Muhammad&apos;s day and was still the dominant cult. According to numerous inscriptions, while the name of the Moon-god was Sin, his title was al-ilah, i.e.&quot;the deity,&quot;meaning that he was the chief or high god among the gods. As **** pointed out,&quot;The god Il or Ilah was originally a phase of the Moon God.&quot;The Moon-god was called al-ilah, i.e. the god, which was shortened to Allah in pre-Islamic times. The pagan Arabs even used Allah in the names they gave to their children. For example, both Muhammad&apos;s father and uncle had Allah as part of their names. The fact that they were given such names by their pagan parents proves that Allah was the title for the Moon-god even in Muhammad&apos;s day. Prof. **** goes on to say,&quot;Similarly, under Mohammed&apos;s tutelage, the
relatively anonymous Ilah, became Al-Ilah, The God, or Allah, the Supreme Being.&quot;This fact answers the questions,&quot;Why is Allah never defined in the Qur&apos;an? Why did Muhammad assume that the pagan Arabs already knew who Allah was?&quot;Muhammad was raised in the religion of the Moon-god Allah. But he went one step further than his fellow pagan Arabs. While they believed that Allah, i.e. the Moon-god, was the greatest of all gods and the supreme deity in a pantheon of deities, Muhammad decided that Allah was not only the greatest god but the only god.

In effect he said,&quot;Look, you already believe that the Moon-god Allah is the greatest of all gods. All I want you to do is to accept that the idea that he is the only god. I am not taking away the Allah you already worship. I am only taking away his wife and his daughters and all the other gods.&quot;This is seen from the fact that the first point of the Muslim creed is not,&quot;Allah is great&quot;but&quot;Allah is the greatest,&quot;i.e., he is the greatest among the gods. Why would Muhammad say that Allah is the&quot;greatest&quot;except in a polytheistic context? The Arabic word is used to contrast the greater from the lesser. That this is true is seen from the fact that the pagan Arabs never accused Muhammad of preaching a different Allah than the one they already worshipped. This&quot;Allah&quot;was the Moon-god according to the archeological evidence. Muhammad thus attempted to have it both ways. To the pagans, he said that he still believed in the Moon-god Allah. To the Jews and the Christians, he said that Allah was their God too. But both the Jews and the Christians knew better and that is why they rejected his god Allah as a false god.

Al-Kindi, one of the early Christian apologists against Islam, pointed out that Islam and its god Allah did not come from the Bible but from the paganism of the Sabeans. They did not worship the God of the Bible but the Moon-god and his daughters al-Uzza, al-Lat and Manat. Dr. Newman concludes his study of the early Christian-Muslim debates by stating,&quot;Islam proved itself to be...a separate and antagonistic religion which had sprung up from idolatry.&quot;Islamic scholar Caesar Farah concluded
&quot;There is no reason, therefore, to accept the idea that Allah passed to the Muslims from the Christians and Jews.&quot;The Arabs worshipped the Moon-god as a supreme deity. But this was not biblical monotheism. While the Moon-god was greater than all other gods and goddesses, this was still a polytheistic pantheon of deities. Now that we have the actual idols of the Moon-god, it is no longer possible to avoid the fact that Allah was a pagan god in pre-Islamic times. Is it any wonder then that the symbol of Islam is the crescent moon? That a crescent moon sits on top of their mosques and minarets? That a crescent moon is found on the flags of Islamic nations? That the Muslims fast during the month which begins and ends with the appearance of the
crescent moon in the sky?

Conclusion:

The pagan Arabs worshipped the Moon-god Allah by praying toward Mecca several times a day; making a pilgrimage to Mecca; running around the temple of the Moon-god called the Kabah; kissing the black stone; killing an animal in sacrifice to the Moon-god; throwing stones at the devil; fasting for the month which begins and ends with the crescent moon; giving alms to the poor, etc. The Muslim&apos;s claim that Allah is the God of the Bible and that Islam arose from the religion of the prophets and apostles is refuted by solid, overwhelming archeological evidence. Islam is nothing more than a revival of the ancient Moon-god cult. It has taken the symbols, the rites, the ceremonies, and even the name of its god from the ancient pagan religion of the Moon-god. As such, it is sheer idolatry and must be rejected by all those who follow the Torah and Gospel.

Knowledge of ahadith is essential in an effort to understand Islam. They contain rules and regulations, when implemented, would give cause to a better understanding of everyday life. This is applicable, to the individual of a society and also to the society as a whole. The messages within the ahadith are for the benefit of both, individual and society.

Among many missions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one was to set a pattern of conduct. The conduct of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) can be found in the voluminous sahihs. We should make an attempt to abide by these rules.

It is unnecessary to mention that research of Islam is beyond the scope of a single individual, a task unattainable in a man&apos;s lifetime, not to say, impossible. To narrow my scope, I had decided to restrict myself to ahadith (even this is a large area of study within Islam). I decided on making a small collection of ahadith. This decision resulted in a minor project that essentially consisted of reading diverse Islamic literature and reading different aspects of Islam. I could, of course, have bought one of many voluminous compilations of ahadith, but I was convinced that I would learn more by finding and compiling them myself and indeed it has been a most fruitful experience. During the compilation, I was becoming aware of the meaning and importance of ahadith and soon realised that others too could benefit from this compilation. With this in mind I was determined to share this collection with my fellow Muslims.

All ahadith in this collection have been, so to say, copied from my source (NOTE A) .Every hadith is followed by the Arabic source it can be found in (e.g. Bukhari, Muslim) along with the source I have written it from (e.g. Sayings of Muhammad by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad). If the reader feels uncertain about a particular hadith she/he can easily trace it to my source.

All the footnotes in the ahadith are not my insertions, but the author&apos;s of my sources. The titles which are given to the ahadith are also titles found in my source, they too, are not my insertions. The same applies for brackets ( ( ) or [] ) found within some ahadith. (These comments do not apply to the titles marked as&quot;Introduction&quot;and&quot;Introduction to Ahadith&quot;) The ahadith are all randomly compiled. The ahadith have been written down as I have encountered them in relevant literature.

Since I have used different literature, there have come cases where two authors use the same title, e.i.&quot;marriage&quot;hence the title will appear twice. This is not to be regarded as a misprint. There is no personal preference as to the choice of authors of my sources. I have obtained these books from different libraries and local mosques.

A problem which was encountered was when two authors wrote on the same subject matter, but from different sahihs, both sahihs had their own wordings but giving the same meaning. I have tried to keep these sort of ahadith to a minimal as I wished to have as many diverse topics as possible. Faith, knowledge, marriage, sex, divorce, rights of wives/husbands and hospitality are a couple of areas covered in this compilation.

I have, to the very best of my abilities, tried to be as careful as possible when writing from the source, this in order not to endanger the real meaning of the hadith, nor to give cause to misinterpretations. As far as spellings are concerned, I have thoroughly checked it. The spellings of Arabic names and places have been written exactly as I have encountered them in the source.

One of my sources,&quot;Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen&quot;written by, Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi, has consistently used the term&quot;Rasulullah&quot;when addressing Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). The Arabic term,&quot;sallallahu alayhi wasallam&quot;has also been used throughout the book. For the ease of non-Muslim readers, I have replaced the Arabic&quot;Rasulullah&quot;by&quot;Muhammad&quot;and&quot;sallallahu alayhi wasallam&quot;by&quot;may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him.&quot;I have treated similarly the terms&quot;radiallahu anhu&quot;and&quot;radiallahu anha.&quot;They have been replaced by&quot;Allah be pleased with him&quot;and&quot;Allah be pleased with her.&quot;I have used the term&quot;peace be upon him&quot;throughout the compilation as most authors have used similar attributes. The same author has also mentioned the narrators&apos;Arabic names for most ahadith, I have done likewise.

Considering the fact that I am a computer science student (August, 1993), with access to Internet, I thought this would serve as a most remarkable media for distribution of this collection. It is recommended, to those readers who have the possibilities, to print out the file and (NOTE B) send a copy to the local mosques who might wish to include this compilation in their library etc. If mosques have the possibilities to print copies of this collection and have it distributed among the visitors/guests to the mosques, it would be appreciated. Thus the collection will not only be restricted to people with network access. The more people who read it, the more it will benefit and also the one who passes on the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him) will also be rewarded by Allah. There is no doubt about this. This compilation is dedicated to the loving memories of my maternal grandfather with whom I spent my first years of a precious life.


--------------------------------------…

Introduction to Ahadith
It goes without saying that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has left us with two powerful sources for the improvement of the individual, the society and for the nations, those are: the Holy Quran and ahadith. The Quran was revealed to the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel. The ahadith show us the diversities a single person can have, and the ways these diversities may be used to produce an optimal performance, where the performance is exemplary for future generations. This was one of the main tasks of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him), to guide humanity on the right path.

Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a son, a husband, a father, an advisor, a warrior, a leader, a judge and most important of all, he was the Seal of the Prophets - the last messenger of Allah. A man with such a character and such a vast field of responsibility is indeed deserving of biographical study, and through the ages, biographical researches have been carried out. The collection of ahadith is the result of these researchers. The study of ahadith is a science itself. To mention some branches within the study of ahadith, there is the science of Asma&apos;ul Rijal (the science of study of the life-history of 500,000 narrators), the science of Mustalih al-Hadith (the science of classifying a hadith as authentic or weak), the science of Gharib al-hadith (the study of the linguistic origins of the difficult words used in ahadith). I have mentioned only three different sciences though this list can extend to over 100. This again indicates the immense importance of ahadith and the importance of understanding them.

The main source of ahadith can be found in six sahihs (NOTE C) These six sahihs are:

Sahih al-Bukhari (d. 256 A.H. = 870 A.D.)
Sahih Muslim (d. 261 A.H. = 875 A.D.)
Sunan Ibn Majah (d. 273 A.H. = 887 A.D.)
Sunan Abu Dawud (d. 275 A.H. = 888 A.D.)
Jami al-Tirmidhi (d. 279 A.H. = 892 A.D.)
Sunan al-Nisai (d. 303 A.H. = 915 A.D.)
A.H. = After Hegira A.D. = Anno Domini

&quot;In preparing their collections, these Traditions obviously used a critical technique to decide what they would include and what they should reject. Bukhari, for example, examined 600,000 traditions of which he excepted only 7,397. There purpose was to assemble a body of traditions which would serve as a rule of life for practising Muslims, so their primary interest was in selecting such traditions as would give clear guidance concerning what Muslims belief and practice should be, what things were permissible and approved, and what were not permissible and disapproved.&quot;
(Shariah: The Islamic Law. by Abdur Rahman I. Doi:54)

It should be quite evident from the above cited paragraph that the task of compiling ahadith was by no means simple. Although the most painstaking techniques had been employed to decide which ahadith should be included and which should be rejected there were found grounds for classification of ahadith. The ahadith are therefore classified in the following manner:

Sahih: These are the genuine Traditions so declared after applying all tests.

Hasan: These are the fair Traditions although inferior in the matter of authenticity to the Sahih.

Daif: These are the weak traditions which are not so very reliable.&quot;
(Ibid:57).
Before I proceed, I wish to explain the meanings of isnad and matn as the understanding of these words is considered profitable for the reader. A hadith consists of two parts. The chain of transmitters comprises one part while the message within the hadith completes it. The former is known as isnad while the latter is matn. Continuing with the classification of ahadith, the daif ahadith are divided further:

The Mu&apos;allaq Traditions: These are those Traditions in which one or two transmitters are omitted in the beginning of the Isnad.

The Maqtu Traditions: These are those Traditions which are reported by a Tabi&apos;i, a man of second category after the Prophet.

The Munqati Traditions: These are the broken Traditions.

The Mursal Traditions: These are the incomplete Traditions in the Isnad of which a companion (Sahabi) is omitted, e.g. A Tabi&apos;i says, the Prophet said....

The Musahhaf Traditions: These are the traditions which have a mistake in words or letters of the Isnad or the Matn e.g. Hasan is written as Hashan.

The Shadh Traditions: These are the traditions with a reliable chain of reporters but their meanings are contrary to other similarly attested Traditions narrated by the majority of the contemporary transmitters.

The Maudu Traditions: These are the fabricated and untrue Traditions.&quot;
(Ibid:57).
I have now presented a very short introduction to the background of ahadith. I would most strongly recommend the interested reader to read the book&quot;Shariah: The Islamic Law&quot;by Abdur Rahman I. Doi. It is a book which I have used extensively and found most interesting and informative. The same author has also published a book which is titled&quot;Non-Muslims under Shariah&quot;, another informative book which I would recommend.

Lastly I would like to thank the people concerned in providing me with the facility for distributing this collection. Without their help, time, and effort, I am quite certain that this work would not have come to the notice of so many people in so many places. May Allah give them peace and bless them all. Amen.

--------------------------------------…

FAITH (IMAN)
1. Islam is based on five things: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His servant and messenger, the observance of the prayer, the payment of Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fast during Ramadan.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

2. The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, and the Emigrant is he who abandons what God has prohibited.
(Bukhari).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

3. None of you believes till I am dearer to him than his father, his child and all mankind.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad)

4. He who is not trustworthy has no Faith, and he who does not keep his Covenant has no religion.
(Baihaqi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

5. What is Faith? When your good deed pleases you and your evil deed grieves you, you are a believer. What is Sin? When a thing disturbs (the peace of) your heart, give it up.
(Ahmad).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

MAJOR SINS AND SIGNS OF HYPOCRISY
6. The major sins are associating other objects of worship with God, disobedience to parents, murder, and deliberate perjury.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

7. There are three signs of a hypocrite: when he speaks he speaks lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is trusted he betrays his trust.
(Bukhari).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

8. Avoid the seven noxious things.(1) Associating anything with God, (2) magic,(3) killing one whom God has declared inviolate without a just cause, (4) devouring usury, (5) consuming the property of an orphan, running back from the battlefield and, (7) slandering chaste women who are believers but indiscreet.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

9. Four characteristics constitute anyone who possesses them a sheer hypocrite, and anyone who possesses one of them possesses a characteristic of hypocrisy till he abandons it: when he is trusted he betrays his trust, when he talks he lies, when he makes a covenant he acts treacherously and when he quarrels he abuses.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

KNOWLEDGE
10. When a man dies no further reward is recorded for his actions, with three exceptions: Sadqa which continues to be supplied, or knowledge from which benefit continues to be reaped, or the prayers of a good son to his dead father.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

11. If anyone removes (one of the) anxieties of this world from a believer, God will remove (one of the) anxieties from him on the Day of Resurrection; if one smoothes the way for one who is destitute, God will smooth the way for him in this world and the next; and if anyone conceals the faults of a Muslim, God will conceal his faults in this world and the next. God helps a man as long as he helps his brother. If anyone pursues a path in search of knowledge God will thereby make easy for him a path to paradise.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

12. He who goes out in search of knowledge is in God&apos;s path till he returns.
(Tirmidhi, Darimi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

13. The search of knowledge is an obligation laid on every Muslim.
(Ibn Majah, Baihaqi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

14. The one who would have the worst position in God&apos;s sight on the Day of Resurrection would be a learned man who did not profit from his learning.
(Darimi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

(Tirmidhi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH
18. People will not sit remembering God without the angels surrounding them, mercy covering them, peace descending on them.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

20. Hadhrat Jaabir (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;The distinguishing factor between kufr and Imaan is the deliberate neglect of Salaat.&quot;
(Muslim).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

21. He who does a good deed will have ten times the amount of blessings, and I [God] shall give more, but he who does an evil deed will have an equivalent reward of evil, or I shall grant forgiveness. If anyone draws the length of a span near Me, I shall draw the length of a cubit near him, and if anyone draws the length of a cubit near Me, I shall draw the length of a fathom near him. If anyone comes to Me walking I shall come to him at a run, and if anyone meets me with sins of the size of the earth, but has not associated anything with Me, I shall meet him a similar amount of forgiveness.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).

22. Hadhrat Jaabir (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;Salaat is the key to Jannat.&quot;

By Allah, other than Whom there is no god, verily one of you behaves like the people of Paradise until there is but an arm&apos;s length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Hell-fire and thus enters it; and one of you behaves like the people of Hell-fire until there is but an arm&apos;s length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Paradise and thus enters it.

He walked and sat down by the Prophet (peace be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing the palm of his hands on his thigh, he said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the zakat (NOTE 4) , to fast in Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House (NOTE 5) if you are able to do so. He said: You have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that he had spoken right. He said: Then tell me about iman (NOTE 6) . The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ) said: It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny, both the good and evil thereof. He said: You have spoken rightly. He said: Then tell me about ihsan (NOTE 7) , The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ) said: It is to worship Allah as though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The slave-girl will give birth to her mistress (NOTE 9) and that you will see the barefooted naked, destitute herdsmen competing in constructing lofty buildings. Then he took himself off and I stayed for a time. Then the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon) said: O Umar, do you know who the questioner was? I said: Allah and hid Messenger know best. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It was Gabriel, who came to you to teach you your religion.

210. That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain and between the two if them are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around the sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah&apos;s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fills the scales, and Subhana&apos;llah [How far is Allah from every imperfection] and Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fill that which is between heaven and earth. Prayer is light; charity is a proof; patience is illumination; and the Quran is an argument for or against you. Everyone starts his day and is a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

216. I have been ordered to fight (NOTE 10) against people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and until he perform the prayers and pay the zakat, and if they do so, they will have gained protection from me for their lives (NOTE 11) and property, unless [they do acts that are punishable] in accordance with Islam, and their reckoning will be with Allah the Almighty.

Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you.&quot;(NOTE 13) Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned [the case of] a man who, having journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the sky [saying]: O Lord! O Lord! - while his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, so how can he be answered!
(Muslim).

(Daraqutni)
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

224. Each person&apos;s every joint must perform a charity every day they comes up: to act justly between two people is a charity; to help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it is a charity; a good word is a charity; every step you take to prayers (i.e. on your way to the mosque) is a charity and removing a harmful thing from the road is a charity.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

225. The blood of a Muslim may not be legally spilt other than in one of three [instances]: the married person commits adultery; a life for life; and one who forsakes his religion and abandons the community.
(Bukhari, Muslim).

But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by . Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

230. Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you. O servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here-and the Prophet (peace be upon him) pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another is inviolable: his blood, his property and his honour.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

231. Some of the Companions (NOTE 17) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to the Prophet:(peace be upon him) O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the rewards: they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the superfluity of their wealth.

Truly every tasbiha (NOTE 18) is a charity every takbira (NOTE 19) is a charity, every tahmida (NOTE 20) is a charity and every tahlia (NOTE 21) is a charity; to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity and in a sexual act each of you there are a charity. They said: O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his sexual desire will he have some reward for that? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do you [not] think that were he to act upon it unlawfully he wold be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.

My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hands with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to ask me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.
(Bukhari).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

233. The son of Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) use to say: At evening do not expect [to live till] morning, and at morning do not expect [to live till] evening. Take from your health for your illness and from your life for your death (NOTE 22).

I am afraid that, with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning to death in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning to death is a duty laid down in Allah&apos;s Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established.
(Muslim).
(The Penal Law of Islam by Muhammad Iqbal Siddiqi).

341. Abdullah b. Umar reported that a Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah&apos;s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who had committed adultery. Allah&apos;s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the Jews and said: What do you find in Torah for one who commits adultery? They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their backs touching each other) and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring the Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salam who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He lifted his hand and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to stoning. Allah&apos;s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pronounced judgement about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. Umar said: I was one of those who stoned them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting her (the Jewess with his body).

342. Allah the Almighty has said: O son Of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it (NOTE 29)

Gabriel said (to me),&apos;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&apos;So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened.

Gabriel said (to me),&apos;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&apos;So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked,&apos;Who is it?&apos;Gabriel answered,&apos;Gabriel&apos;It was asked,&apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Muhammad.&apos;It was asked,&apos;Has he been called?&apos;Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said,&apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me),&apos;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&apos;So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked,&apos;Who is it?&apos;Gabriel answered,&apos;Gabriel&apos;It was asked,&apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Muhammad.&apos;It was asked,&apos;Has he been called?&apos;Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said,&apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;The gate was opened, and when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aron) Gabriel said (to me),&apos;This is Aron; pay him your greetings.&apos;So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked,&apos;Who is it?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Gabriel&apos;It was asked,&apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Muhammad.&apos;It was asked,&apos;Has he been called?&apos;Gabriel replied in the affirmative.

Gabriel said (to me),&apos;This is Moses; pay him your greetings.&apos;So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos;When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked,&apos;What makes you weep?&apos;Moses said,&apos;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked,&apos;Who is it?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Gabriel&apos;It was asked,&apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos;Gabriel replied,&apos;Muhammad.&apos;It was asked,&apos;Has he been called?&apos;Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said,&apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me),&apos;This is your father; pay him your greetings.&apos;So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said,&apos;You are welcomed, o pious son and pious Prophet.&apos;Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the farthest limit). Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said,&apos;This is the Lote Tree of the farthest limit.&apos;Behold! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible. I asked,&apos;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&apos;He replied,&apos;As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos;Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur (i.e.the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked,&apos;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&apos;Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me),&apos;What have you been ordered to do?&apos;I replied,&apos;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&apos;Moses said,&apos;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israil (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reducing your followers&apos;burden.&apos;So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers.

He fears his Raab and is kind (and renders service) to his relatives. And, in regard to the wealth he follows the commands of Allah and discharges rights. This man is the noblest...&quot;
(Tirmidhi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

ABSTAINING FROM SIN
482. Hadhrat Ka&apos;b Bin Malik (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad said:&quot;Two hungry wolves let loose in a flock of sheep do not cause so much damage to the flock as does the love of wealth and vanity to one&apos;s Deen.&quot;

If he makes isitighfaar and taubah, the black mark is removed and his heart is purified. If he increases his sin, the black mark increases. This is the corrosion of the heart spoken by Allah Ta&apos;ala (in the Qur&apos;an).&quot;
(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

484. Hadhrat Abdullah Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) cursed the taker and giver of bribery.
(Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Tirmidhi).

485. Hadhrat Anas Bin Malik (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;Should I not show you your sickness and its remedy? Your sickness is sinning and your remedy is to seek forgiveness (istighfaar).&quot;
(Baihaqi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

486. Hadhrat Ibn Abaas (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;When khiyaanat (abuse of trust) becomes rampant in a people, Allah Ta&apos;ala overwhelms their hearts with fear. A nation perpetrating injustice will be overpowered by its enemies.&quot;
(Malik).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

487. Hadhrat Thaubaan (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;There will soon come a time when all nations (of the kufaar) will unite against you ( Muslims)...&quot;Someone asked:&quot;Will we be less in numbers at that time?&quot;Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&apos;In fact, you will be numerous, but useless...Allah Ta&apos;ala will remove your respect and your fears from the hearts of your enemies (who will then despise you) and Allah will instil weakness in your hearts.&quot;Someone asked:&apos;What is the cause of the weakness?&apos;Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;Love of the world and detestation for Maut.&quot;
(Abu Dawud, Baihaqi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

488. Hadhrat Anas (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;The hearts too become corroded (by means of sin). Its polish is istighfaar.&quot;
(Baihaqi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

RECITING AND TEACHING THE QUR&apos;AN MAJEED
491. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;He who recites the Qur&apos;an well and clearly is equal in rank to the Angels who record creation&apos;s deeds. These Angels are gracious, honourable and of lofty rank. He who finds difficulty in reciting the Qur&apos;an will obtain a double reward.&quot;
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

492. A person whose breast is devoid of the Qur&apos;an (i.e. has not learnt anything of the Qur&apos;an Majeed) is like a desolate house.
(Tirmidhi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

493. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;A person who recites one harf (letter) of the Qur&apos;an, obtains one virtue; each virtue multiplies to ten virtues. I am not saying that (ALM) is one harf. But, Alif in it is one harf; the Laam in it is one harf and the Meem in it is one harf.&quot;
(Tirmidhi, Darimi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

494. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;On the day of Qiyaamah a crown of such brilliance will be placed on the heads of the parents of one who learnt the Qur&apos;an and practised on its laws, that its glitter will outshine the brilliance of the sun which penetrates your houses. What then do you think will be the position of the one who himself learnt the Qur&apos;an and acted in accordance with it?&quot;
(Ahmad, Abu Dawud).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

495. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;He who recites the Qur&apos;an, memorizes it,accepts its halal (lawful things) as halal and haram (forbidden things) as haram (i.e. his beliefs in these matters are correct), Allah Ta&apos;ala will enter him to Jannat and accept his intercession on behalf of ten such persons of his family upon whom entry into Janhannum has become incumbent (i.e. Allah Ta&apos;ala will forgive them because of his intercession).&quot;
(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Darimi).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

496. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;Continue reciting the Qur&apos;an because on the Day of Qiyaamah it will appear as an intercessor for the reciter.&quot;
(Muslim).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

497. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;He who listens to even a single aayat (being recited by another) obtains such a virtue which perpetually multiplies (it increases in thawaab continuously). The one who recited the aayat will on the Day of Qiyaamah find the recited aayat in the form of a Noor (which will be of greater value and significance than the virtue which accrued to the one who had listened to the recitation).&quot;
(Ahmad).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

498. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;The best of you are those who learn the Qur&apos;an and teach it.&quot;
(Bukhari).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

499. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:&quot;On the Day of Qiyaamah the Qur&apos;an will petition Allah to cloak the one who had recited it with garments of honour and respect. A crown of honour will then be placed on the head of the reciter. The Qur&apos;an will then petition Allah Ta&apos;ala to shower His pleasure on the reciter. Allah will then become pleased with him. The reciter will then be asked to recite the Qur&apos;an, thereby attaining higher ranks of elevation. In reward for each aayat a virtue will accrue to him.&quot;
(Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaimah).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

500. Continue climbing (higher and higher in rank) with your recitation in the same way as you recited with care and concern on earth. Your abode (of residing) is located (at that rank attained) with the last aayat recited.
(Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Habbaan).
(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen. by Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).

(NOTE 23)
A hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) refers a saying to Allah, the Prophet himself being merely the narrator. Unlike the Quran, one cannot say of a hadith qudsi that&quot;Allah said it.&quot;In the case of a hadith qudsi, the meaning is from Allah but the words are the Prophet&apos;s, transmitted to him either through a vision or revelation.

The superiority of race over race and family over family is recognised -people are mines like mines of gold and silver- among Muslims as well as non Muslims, but it is added that this superiority is maintained through attainment of knowledge. If persons belonging to a superior race discard knowledge, they lose their superiority. Racial or family superiority is thus subject to the acquisition of knowledge.

(NOTE 32)
Duff or daff is the tambourine, and the object of beating with daff at marriage is to make it publicly known. It also furnishes a kind of music.


(NOTE 33)
The technical word for temporary marriage is mut&apos;ah. It is derived from mata meaning profiting for a long time. Mut&apos;ah is considered to be a legal form of marriage by the Shi&apos;ahs, but the vast majority of the Muslim community rejects it in the basis of this hadith quoted here. The Holy Quran uses the word ihsan (lit. being inaccessible) for marriage, and thus looks upon marriage as a permanent relation which can be cut off only by divorce. For all of the kinds of sexual relationship it uses the word safah, which signifies fornication. According to some hadith, mut&apos;ah was allowed by the Holy Prophet in a war. Even if this be true, it may have been allowed at an earlier stage, reform having been brought about gradually, but there is not the least doubt that it was finally disallowed.


(NOTE 34)
This is the general practice, but as the next hadith shows, one goat sufficed in the case of a boy as well. It is only for those who can afford it.


(NOTE 35)
This means that each of the two parts of the moon was on the either side of the mountain of Hira.


(NOTE 36)
Iqamat -us-Salat: The offering of the prayers perfectly. This is not understood by many Muslims. It means:
A) All members of a family or group etc., of a town or a village etc., must offer the prayers; all the males in the mosque for the five congregational prayers and the females in their houses both young and old from seven years and upwards, (and no member of the family is to be excused) at the five fixed stated hours for the five compulsory prayers. If any member intentionally did not offer the prayer, then even if the others prayed, they did not offer the prayer (dutifully and perfectly). Each chief (of a family or a town or a village etc.,) is responsible for it before Allah.
B) To offer a prayer in a way just as the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) offered it with all its rules and regulations.


(NOTE 37)
Meaning thereby that their grace and tenderness deserve special regard from men.


(NOTE 38)
Twelve (12) Auqiahs are the equal to near 500 dirhams or Rs.132.(1984)&quot;ri).

Introduction to Ahadith
It goes without saying that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has left us with two powerful sources for the improvement of the individual, the society and for the nations, those are: the Holy Quran and ahadith. The Quran was revealed to the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel. The ahadith show us the diversities a single person can have, and the ways these diversities may be used to produce an optimal performance, where the performance is exemplary for future generations. This was one of the main tasks of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him), to guide humanity on the right path.


Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a son, a husband, a father, an advisor, a warrior, a leader, a judge and most important of all, he was the Seal of the Prophets - the last messenger of Allah. A man with such a character and such a vast field of responsibility is indeed deserving of biographical study, and through the ages, biographical researches have been carried out. The collection of ahadith is the result of these researchers. The study of ahadith is a science itself. To mention some branches within the study of ahadith, there is the science of Asma&apos;ul Rijal (the science of study of the life-history of 500,000 narrators), the science of Mustalih al-Hadith (the science of classifying a hadith as authentic or weak), the science of Gharib al-hadith (the study of the linguistic origins of the difficult words used in ahadith). I have mentioned only three different sciences though this list can extend to over 100. This again indicates the immense importance of ahadith and the importance of understanding them.


The main source of ahadith can be found in six sahihs. These six sahihs are:


Sahih al-Bukhari
(d. 256 A.H. = 870 A.D.)

Sahih Muslim
(d. 261 A.H. = 875 A.D.)

Sunan Ibn Majah
(d. 273 A.H. = 887 A.D.)

Sunan Abu Dawud
(d. 275 A.H. = 888 A.D.)

Jami al-Tirmidhi
(d. 279 A.H. = 892 A.D.)

Sunan al-Nisai
(d. 303 A.H. = 915 A.D.)



A.H. = After Hegira A.D. = Anno Domini

&quot;In preparing their collections, these Traditions obviously used a critical technique to decide what they would include and what they should reject. Bukhari, for example, examined 600,000 traditions of which he excepted only 7,397. There purpose was to assemble a body of traditions which would serve as a rule of life for practising Muslims, so their primary interest was in selecting such traditions as would give clear guidance concerning what Muslims belief and practice should be, what things were permissible and approved, and what were not permissible and disapproved.&quot;
(Shariah: The Islamic Law. by Abdur Rahman I. Doi:54)

It should be quite evident from the above cited paragraph that the task of compiling ahadith was by no means simple. Although the most painstaking techniques had been employed to decide which ahadith should be included and which should be rejected there were found grounds for classification of ahadith. The ahadith are therefore classified in the following manner:

1.Sahih: These are the genuine Traditions so declared after applying all tests.
2.Hasan: These are the fair Traditions although inferior in the matter of authenticity to the Sahih.
3. Daif: These are the weak traditions which are not so very reliable.&quot;
(Ibid:57).

Before I proceed, I wish to explain the meanings of isnad and matn as the understanding of these words is considered profitable for the reader. A hadith consists of two parts. The chain of transmitters comprises one part while the message within the hadith completes it. The former is known as isnad while the latter is matn. Continuing with the classification of ahadith, the daif ahadith are divided further:

a The Mu&apos;allaq Traditions: These are those Traditions in which one or two transmitters are omitted in the beginning of the Isnad.
b. The Maqtu Traditions: These are those Traditions which are reported by a Tabi&apos;i, a man of second category after the Prophet.
c. The Munqati Traditions: These are the broken Traditions.
d. The Mursal Traditions: These are the incomplete Traditions in the Isnad of which a companion (Sahabi) is omitted, e.g. A Tabi&apos;i says, the Prophet said....
e. The Musahhaf Traditions: These are the traditions which have a mistake in words or letters of the Isnad or the Matn e.g. Hasan is written as Hashan.
f. The Shadh Traditions: These are the traditions with a reliable chain of reporters but their meanings are contrary to other similarly attested Traditions narrated by the majority of the contemporary transmitters.
g. The Maudu Traditions: These are the fabricated and untrue Traditions.&quot;
(Ibid:57).

I have now presented a very short introduction to the background of ahadith. I would most strongly recommend the interested reader to read the book&quot;Shariah: The Islamic Law&quot;by Abdur Rahman I. Doi. It is a book which I have used extensively and found most interesting and informative. The same author has also published a book which is titled&quot;Non-Muslims under Shariah&quot;, another informative book which I would recommend.


Lastly I would like to thank the people concerned in providing me with the facility for distributing this collection. Without their help, time, and effort, I am quite certain that this work would not have come to the notice of so many people in so many places. May Allah give them peace and bless them all. Amen.

FAITH (IMAN)
1.

Islam is based on five things: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His servant and messenger, the observance of the prayer, the payment of Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fast during Ramadan.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


2.

The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, and the Emigrant is he who abandons what God has prohibited.
(Bukhari).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


3.

None of you believes till I am dearer to him than his father, his child and all mankind.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad)


4.

He who is not trustworthy has no Faith, and he who does not keep his Covenant has no religion.
(Baihaqi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


5.

What is Faith? When your good deed pleases you and your evil deed grieves you, you are a believer. What is Sin? When a thing disturbs (the peace of) your heart, give it up.
(Ahmad).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).





MAJOR SINS AND SIGNS OF HYPOCRISY
6.

The major sins are associating other objects of worship with God, disobedience to parents, murder, and deliberate perjury.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


7.

There are three signs of a hypocrite: when he speaks he speaks lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is trusted he betrays his trust.
(Bukhari).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


8.

Avoid the seven noxious things.(1) Associating anything with God, (2) magic,(3) killing one whom God has declared inviolate without a just cause, (4) devouring usury, (5) consuming the property of an orphan, running back from the battlefield and, (7) slandering chaste women who are believers but indiscreet.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


9.

Four characteristics constitute anyone who possesses them a sheer hypocrite, and anyone who possesses one of them possesses a characteristic of hypocrisy till he abandons it: when he is trusted he betrays his trust, when he talks he lies, when he makes a covenant he acts treacherously and when he quarrels he abuses.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).




KNOWLEDGE
10.

When a man dies no further reward is recorded for his actions, with three exceptions: Sadqa which continues to be supplied, or knowledge from which benefit continues to be reaped, or the prayers of a good son to his dead father.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


11.

If anyone removes (one of the) anxieties of this world from a believer, God will remove (one of the) anxieties from him on the Day of Resurrection; if one smoothes the way for one who is destitute, God will smooth the way for him in this world and the next; and if anyone conceals the faults of a Muslim, God will conceal his faults in this world and the next. God helps a man as long as he helps his brother. If anyone pursues a path in search of knowledge God will thereby make easy for him a path to paradise.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


12.

He who goes out in search of knowledge is in God&apos;s path till he returns.
(Tirmidhi, Darimi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


13.

The search of knowledge is an obligation laid on every Muslim.
(Ibn Majah, Baihaqi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


14.

The one who would have the worst position in God&apos;s sight on the Day of Resurrection would be a learned man who did not profit from his learning.
(Darimi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).




SUPPLICATIONS (DUA)
15.

A man is granted supplication provided he does not ask for anything sinful or for breaking ties of relationship.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


16.

You have two characters which God likes; gentleness and deliberation.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


17.

Nothing but supplication averts the decree, and nothing but righteousness increases life.
(Tirmidhi).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).





REMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH
18.

People will not sit remembering God without the angels surrounding them, mercy covering them, peace descending on them.
(Muslim).
(Sayings of Muhammad. by Prof. Ghazi Ahmad).


19.

He who remembers his Lord and he who does not are like the living and dead.
(Bukhari, Muslim).

Verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother&apos;s belly for forty days in the form of a seed, then he is a clot of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period, then there is sent to him the angel who blows the breath of life into him and who is commanded about four matters to write down his means of livelihood, his life span, his actions, and whether happy or unhappy. By Allah, other than Whom there is no god, verily one of you behaves like the people of Paradise until there is but an arm&apos;s length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Hell-fire and thus enters it; and one of you behaves like the people of Hell-fire until there is but an arm&apos;s length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he behaves like the people of Paradise and thus enters it.

He walked and sat down by the Prophet (peace be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing the palm of his hands on his thigh, he said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the zakat, to fast in Ramadan, and to make the pilgrimage to the House if you are able to do so. He said: You have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that he had spoken right. He said: Then tell me about iman. The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny, both the good and evil thereof. He said: You have spoken rightly. He said: Then tell me about ihsan, The Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him ) said: It is to worship Allah as though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you. He said then tell me about the Hour, The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The one questioned about it knows no better than the questioner. He said: Tell me about its signs. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and that you will see the barefooted naked, destitute herdsmen competing in constructing lofty buildings. Then he took himself off and I stayed for a time. Then the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon) said: O Umar, do you know who the questioner was? I said: Allah and hid Messenger know best. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It was Gabriel, who came to you to teach you your religion.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


210.

That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain and between the two if them are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around the sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah&apos;s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

Purity is half of faith. Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fills the scales, and Subhana&apos;llah [How far is Allah from every imperfection] and Al-hamdu lillah [Praise be to Allah] fill that which is between heaven and earth. Prayer is light; charity is a proof; patience is illumination; and the Quran is an argument for or against you. Everyone starts his day and is a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


216.

I have been ordered to fight against people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and until he perform the prayers and pay the zakat, and if they do so, they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property, unless [they do acts that are punishable] in accordance with Islam, and their reckoning will be with Allah the Almighty.

Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you.&quot;Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned [the case of] a man who, having journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the sky [saying]: O Lord! O Lord! - while his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, so how can he be answered!

(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


224.

Each person&apos;s every joint must perform a charity every day they comes up: to act justly between two people is a charity; to help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it is a charity; a good word is a charity; every step you take to prayers (i.e. on your way to the mosque) is a charity and removing a harmful thing from the road is a charity.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).

The blood of a Muslim may not be legally spilt other than in one of three [instances]: the married person commits adultery; a life for life; and one who forsakes his religion and abandons the community.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


226.

Were people to be given in accordance with their claim, men would claim the fortunes and lives of [other] people, but the onus of proof is on the claimant and the taking of an oath is the incumbent upon him who denies.

But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed.
(Bukhari, Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by . Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


230.

Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you. O servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety
is right here-and the Prophet (peace be upon him) pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another is inviolable: his blood, his property and his honour.
(Muslim).
(Forty Hadith translated by. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies).


231.

Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to the Prophet:(peace be upon him) O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the rewards: they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the superfluity of their wealth. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Has not Allah made things for you to give away in charity? Truly every tasbiha is a charity every takbira is a charity, every tahmida is a charity and every tahlia is a charity; to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity and in a sexual act each of you there are a charity. They said: O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his sexual desire will he have some reward for that? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do you [not] think that were he to act upon it unlawfully he wold be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.

Allah the Almighty has said: Whosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, I shall be at war with him. My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him.

340.

Verily, Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with truth and He sent down the Book upon him and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained in our memory and understood it. Allah&apos;s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning to death. I am afraid that, with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning to death in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning to death is a duty laid down in Allah&apos;s Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established.
(Muslim).

They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their backs touching each other) and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring the Torah if you are truthful. They brought it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salam who was at that time with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He lifted his hand and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to stoning. Allah&apos;s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pronounced judgement about both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. Umar said: I was one of those who stoned them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting her (the Jewess with his body).
(Muslim).
(The Penal Law of Islam by Muhammad Iqbal Siddiqi).


342.

Allah the Almighty has said: O son Of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it.
(Tirmidhi).

Someone asked,&apos;What makes you weep?&apos;Moses said,&apos;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened.

Gabriel said,&apos;This is the Lote Tree of the farthest limit.&apos;Behold! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible. I asked,&apos;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&apos;He replied,&apos;As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos;Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur (i.e.the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked,&apos;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&apos;Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me),&apos;What have you been ordered to do?&apos;I replied,&apos;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&apos;Moses said,&apos;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israil (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reducing your followers&apos;burden.&apos;So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back and Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah was ordered to observe five prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he said,&apos;What have you been ordered?&apos;I replied,&apos;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&apos;He said,&apos;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israil, so go back to your Lord and ask for reducing your followers&apos;burden.&apos;I said,&apos;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&apos;s order.&apos;When I left, I head a voice saying,&apos;I have passed My Order and have reduced the burden of My Worshippers.&apos;&quot;

For every Salaat performed (this refers to Taraweeh Salaat) during the nights of Ramadhan, Allah Ta&apos;ala records one and a half thousand good deeds for every Sajdah (of the Salaat). And, for the fasting person, Allah Ta&apos;ala creates in Jannat a mansion of red Ya&apos;koot (a precious stone in Jannat). This mansion will have seven thousand entrances. (So huge will these entrances be that in each entrance will be located) a palace of gold adorned with red Ya&apos;koot. When the Muslims fast the first day if Ramadhan, Allah Ta&apos;ala forgives all his sins committed from the first of the previous Ramadhan. Daily (i.e. during Ramadhan) from the time of Fajr Salat until sunset, seventy thousand Malaaikah supplicate for his forgiveness. In return for every Sajdah which he (the fasting person) makes, of any Salat, whether during the day or night, he will obtain (such a wonderful) tree (so huge) that a horseman will take five hundred years to pass under its shade.&quot;

 Satan is, obviously since this world reflects the spirit of the one who is in control if it. the greed, immorality, crime, perversness...
consider 1 John 5:19 We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the [power of the] wicked one. God will eventually destroy Satan and set up His Kingdom as a world government and Satan will no longer have any influence over us. Thank goodness!!

 God&apos;s Word tells us the answer at 2 Corinthians 4:4--&quot;In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.&quot;
The god of this world is Satan the Devil but Revelation 12:12 tells us that his evil influence on this world will not last--&quot;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.&quot;

 The most concise definition of God in Islam is given in the four verses of Surah Ikhlas which is Chapter 112 of the Qur’an:

&quot;Say: He is Allah,
The One and Only.
&quot;Allah, the Eternal, Absolute.
&quot;He begets not, nor is He begotten.
And there is none like unto Him.&quot;
[Al-Qur’an 112:1-4]

The word ‘Assamad’ is difficult to translate. It means ‘absolute existence’, which can be attributed only to Allah (swt), all other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that Allah (swt) is not dependant on any person or thing, but all persons and things are dependant on Him.

Surah Ikhlas (Chapter 112) of the Glorious Qur’an, is the touchstone of theology. ‘Theo’ in Greek means God and ‘logy’ means study. Thus Theology means study of God and to Muslims this four line definition of Almighty God serves as the touchstone of the study of God. Any candidate to divinity must be subjected to this ‘acid test’. Since the attributes of Allah given in this chapter are unique, false gods and pretenders to divinity can be easily dismissed using these verses.

The Qur’an says:

&quot;Say: Call upon Allah, or
Call upon Rahman:
By whatever name you call
Upon Him, (it is well):
For to Him belong
The Most Beautiful Names.&quot;
[Al-Qur’an 17:110]

A similar message regarding the beautiful names of Allah (swt) is repeated in the Qur’an in Surah Al-A’raf (7:180), in Surah Taha (20:8) and in Surah Al-Hashr (59:24).

The Qur’an gives no less than ninety-nine different attributes to Almighty Allah. The Qur’an refers to Allah as Ar-Rahman (Most Gracious), Ar-Raheem (Most Merciful) and Al-Hakeem (All Wise) among many other names. You can call Allah by any name but that name should be beautiful and should not conjure up a mental picture.
Some polytheists argue by saying that the existence of more than one God is not illogical. Let us point out to them that if there were more than one God, they would dispute with one another, each god trying to fulfill his will against the will of the other gods. This can be seen in the mythology of the polytheistic and pantheistic religions. If a ‘God’ is defeated or unable to defeat the others, he is surely not the one true God. Also popular among polytheistic religions is the idea of many Gods, each having different responsibilities. Each one would be responsible for a part of man’s existence e.g. a Sun-God, a Rain-God, etc. This indicates that one ‘God’ is incompetent of certain acts and moreover he is also ignorant of the other Gods’ powers, duties, functions and responsibilities. There cannot be an ignorant and incapable God. If there were more than one God it would surely lead to confusion, disorder, chaos and destruction in the universe. But the universe is in complete harmony. The Glorious Qur’an says:

&quot;If there were, in the heavens
And the earth, other gods
Besides Allah, there would
Have been confusion in both!
But glory to Allah,
The Lord of the Throne:
(High is He) above
What they attribute to Him!&quot;
[Al-Qur’an 21:22]

If there were more than one God, they would have taken away what they created. The Qur’an says:

&quot;No son did Allah beget,
Nor is there any god
Along with Him: (if there were
Many gods), behold, each god
Would have taken away
What he had created,
And some would have
Lorded it over others!
Glory to Allah! (He is free)
From the (sort of) things
They attribute to Him!&quot;
[Al-Qur’an 23:91]

Thus the existence of one True, Unique, Supreme, Almighty God, is the only logical concept of God.
