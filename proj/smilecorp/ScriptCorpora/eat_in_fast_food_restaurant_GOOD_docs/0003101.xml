 Free Online CPR Certification?
 Please forgive me if this is not posted in the right spot!
Can you help me please?

I need to find a *free* or very inexpensive online CPR/1st Aid Class. I found one a couple years ago but cannot seem to locate it again. I thought all the freebie experts here would be my best bet to find it again - and the info would be useful to all!

We are registering to do foster to adopt and taking an online class is the best choice for us right now.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Dana

This is the first one that came up in the search results, and states:

We offer CPR Certification and First Aid Certification and upon successful CPR course or First Aid course completion you may order a professional, full-color wall certificate which can be framed for display or a conveniently sized wallet card to accompany you at all times. FirstAidWeb Inc. CPR certification and First Aid certification are issued in exclusive partnership with National Health and Safety Foundation and are valid for 2 years from date of issue.

Not sure if you&quot;have&quot;to buy the certificate from them, but there&apos;s plenty more search results to go through. Reply With Quote 11-21-2008,  12:05 PM #3 katland

 Registered User Join Date Oct 2006 Posts 16,926 I don&apos;t mean to be insensitive, but&quot;online&quot;and&quot;CPR course&quot;don&apos;t seem to agree. I took the adult CPR course from the Red Cross years ago, and I can&apos;t imagine getting certified without hands-on learning&amp;testing. If you want to look into a Red Cross class you can start here http://www.redcross.org/SERVICES/HSS/courses/ 

Many community colleges offer this as well.

I&apos;m assuming this is a requirement in order to be a foster parent? If so, can the foster agency help you find a class? If you haven&apos;t already, you may wish to confirm that they will accept an online course, if CPR / first aid training is a requirement, just so you don&apos;t waste any time.

That&apos;s wonderful, becoming a foster / adoptive parent! Reply With Quote 11-21-2008,  12:20 PM #4 LITTLEMIDGET

 Registered User Join Date Sep 2007 Posts 5 I do medical foster care and I found that if you go through the American Heart Association it&apos;s a lot cheaper, I just did my adult, child and infant cpr calss and it was only $20.00 for a 2 year certification and the guy came out to our house and did it we had 5-6 of us that were doing it to make it worth his time. I&apos;m not sure if the state DCF would accept an online certification. Reply With Quote 11-21-2008,  01:15 PM #6 gudch1

 Registered User Join Date Jun 2007 Posts 1,243 Most licenses require that this training be done ONLY through American red cross. I always had to be recertified for being a day care provider and the cost is usually around $30 but it had to be done through Red cross.

You can sometimes get it done at liocal fire stations for free or at a reduced price if you can get a group together. Why not gather family, friends and co -workers and go this route.??? Reply With Quote 11-21-2008,  01:18 PM #8 ShoutToTheLord

Thanks
 Thanks for all your suggestions. I will try the local fire dept and see what they offer. I have taken CPR/1st aid 4 times in the past for various things - foster care, teaching in church, rafting trip... so I feel confident taking an online course and had hoped to find one online that would be easy on the schedule (we have 5 kids) and the wallet (we have 5 kids).... and the woman I spoke with regarding foster/adopt seemed to indicate an online certificate would be just fine.

Thanks again!
