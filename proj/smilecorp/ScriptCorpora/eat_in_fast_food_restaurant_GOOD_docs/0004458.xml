Why Americans Are Still Overweight
 Sam Montana @montana410 — Ranked #1 in Obesity FOLLOW Americans are still gaining weight and more of us are becoming overweight or obese. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines show the reasons why are obvious. 
The Dietary Guideline from the USDA came out in June 2010 and the fact is that Americans are still gaining weight and more of us are becoming overweight or obese. Why more of us are now overweight and obese is very obvious. There is just no mystery to this.

Even though the USDA food pyramids this past decade has been on the increasing overweight and obesity problems in the US, young and old Americans continue to gain weight. These food pyramids are supposed to teach us and help us to eat healthy and not become obese. Maybe the pyramids have been wrong in some areas, but there are numerous other answers to this problem.

It is not only the problem of being overweight or obese; it is the health problems that being overweight can lead to; heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome .

The USDA food pyramids are colorful and designed with a lot of thought and research, the sad part is that a large percentage of Americans either don’t care or don’t want to change their dietary habits. And we are bombarded with contradictory findings, studies and new diets.
 
 

Calories and More Calories Equal Overweight Problem

It is not only too many calories, it is the empty calories and where the calories come from like the chemically added processed foods that contain few nutrients and soda pop drinks. A homemade chocolate cake has more nutritional value than many of the processed foods sold today.

The new 2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines says that the current average American diet bears little resemblance to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines that they recommended five years ago. The new Dietary Guidelines concludes that Americans still eat too much saturated and solid fats, sugar, refined grains and too many calories. Americans don’t eat enough dietary fiber or foods that contain vitamin D , calcium, potassium and omega-3 fatty acids.

Even though this report is very lengthy, it appears there are some clear answers to why Americans are still gaining weight and the percentage of overweight and obese children and adults continues to climb. Below are some eye-opening statistics that will probably explain just why Americans are still becoming overweight, obese and still gaining weight.

 The amount of available food continues to increase. This does not mean the amount of carrots or broccoli is increasing, it means the amount of foods that aren’t great for our health or waistline, the foods that cause us to become overweight without us even being aware of it until we are overweight. The average daily calories for Americans have increased from 2,057 in 1970 to 2,674 calories per day in 2008. Since 3,500 calories equals 1 pound, this is an extra pound every 5.67 days or 64 extra pounds gained per year compared to 1970 The increased availability of added oils and fats - this is added and doesn’t mean the already natural fats in meat or dairy - has increased from 56 pounds per person in 1970 to 87 pounds per person in 2008, a 56% increase in added fats, mainly in processed foods. The availability of added sugars and sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup to our foods and drinks has increased 15% since 1970 to 136 pounds per person in 2008. High fructose corn syrup seems to be in almost every food we buy and it is just like sugar and could actually be worse for us when it comes to gaining weight and fatty liver disease. Since 1984, the availability of soft drinks has increased from 39 gallons per person per year to 47 gallons per person a year. 

As you can see in the following chart, the types of food with the largest increase in consumption were the added fats, oils, and flour and cereal products with calories from vegetables decreasing. The flour and cereal products they mention are mostly from the white or refined flour or the bad carbs .

 Calories 1970 1990 2008 Dairy 155 260 257 Fruits 71 85 87 Vegetables 125 126 122 Meat, eggs and nuts 463 453 482 Flour and cereal products 432 573 625 Caloric sweeteners 402 446 459 Added fats and oils 403 446 616 Other dairy fats 6 15 25 

 Source : ERS Food Availability (Per Capita)

Along with the increased availability of food so has the number of restaurants increased. The number of restaurants increased 89% while the number of fast food places increased 147% between 1972 and 1995.

With all the new and easy to prepare processed foods with their high levels of sodium, chemicals and the lack of real food in them and restaurants with super-size meals, it is hard to resist until you actually become overweight.

 What is the Answer to the Overweight Problem 

The USDA has not released the new 2011 version of the food pyramid yet. According to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, they will be recommending the same common sense guidelines like eat less sugar, less bad fats and meat and for us to eat more vegetables, beans and fish.

With past food pyramids seemingly failing and the overweight and obesity problem increasing, the 2010 report is also hinting for us to switch to a more plant based diet like the Mediterranean diet or even a vegetarian diet. It will be interesting to see the new USDA food pyramid and actual recommendations.

The bottom line is to eat smaller portions of healthier foods and cook more of your own meals.

Sam, was all this data collected from the USDA?
 Posted 20 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
Hi James, yes from the USDA.
 Posted 20 months ago James R. Coffey 
Thanks, Sam. Didn&apos;t want to commit it to my permanent file
without having all the background and sources.
 Posted 20 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
James, click on the 2010 USDA Dietary Guideline link under the
resources section of the article, much of this info came from Part
D Section 1. Lots of stats, graphs and tables. The dietary
guideline is a huge report.

I think this is only the tip of the iceberg - there are many
reasons.. bad parenting to be included.
 Posted 20 months ago Brenda Nelson 
oh brother.. that was my comment, the system kicked me out. I
think if a parent has fat kids they are just as guilty of child
abuse as one who has underfed kids. so many say that good food
costs more but that is NOT true - LESS food costs LESS! canned soup
is cheap.
 Posted 20 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
Brenda, remember though, canned soup is also part of the problem
of processed food. At least some brands are. Extremely high in
sodium and too many chemicals. Making one&apos;s own soup is really the
way to go. I think learning to cook even simple foods is as
important as nutrition education. Getting away from processed foods
is one partial answer. Some of the stuff that is passed off as food
at the store today is almost laughable.
 Posted 20 months ago James R. Coffey 
You&apos;re absolutely right, Sam. Campbell&apos;s soups made the &quot;10
foods not to feed your kids&quot; list several years running. Canned
soup is somewhere between junk and poison.
 Posted 20 months ago Ron Siojo 
Excellent article Sam, thank you.
 Posted 20 months ago DeeBee 
The Brits are no better Sam, and there really is no excuse, what
with TV, internet and governmental schemes, we are all so well
educated in health and fitness these days.It&apos;s the young people
that sadden me the most, they live on fast food and microwave meals
and they are just huge because of it.When I was a young woman I
would die before I would put on weight, but they just don&apos;t seem to
care anymore.
 Posted 20 months ago Lauren Axelrod 
I have devoted my ongoing battle with weight gain to becoming a
vegetarian. It&apos;s helped so far.
 Posted 20 months ago thestickman 
What always got me riled was the fact that the USDA insists that
the chart MUST be a pyramid! They put the good stuff at the bottom
(okay, -carbs... not so good but...) and they put the &apos;junk food&apos;
towards the top, and depict a climber ascending this mountain of
food... It sends the wrong message. We associate &apos;top&apos; with
&apos;better&apos; while USDA insists that &apos;base&apos; is &apos;stronger&apos; Ditch the
pyramid scheme and give a meaningful depictions of an actual daily
requirement. I mean EXACTLY how many slices of bread, how many
fruits&amp;vegetables, etc. Hard to do because there are so many.
Whatever... but there must be a better way to show this than a
stairsteps leading towards ...the unhealthy foods! :-\ Stop the
pyramid depictions; find some other way. Show a serving plate with
sections by proportion. Something. Our fixation with &apos;the pyramid
depiction&apos; is not workable.
 Posted 20 months ago James R. Coffey 
Quite right, Stickman. Another example of the use of reverse
psychology perpetrated against the American public.
 Posted 20 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
Thanks Ron. Stickman, I never really understood their pyramid
either. More confusing than helpful over the years. I don’t
know what their new design will look like when they release it.
Lauren, even as a vegetarian, losing excess weight and fat is not
automatic. You still have to watch eating too many carbs. I wrote
in another article about that. The article is at

 Posted 20 months ago Bella Delanna 
As a mother-- a single one who lives paycheck to paycheck-- I
know that we can get 2 cheeseburgers at McDonalds for $2, but if we
were to go to the store to buy fresh ingredients for a healthier
meal it would cost much more. Towards the end of the pay period,
sometimes it&apos;s a choice of whether I can budget out those last few
dollars, no matter what it is we have to eat, we have to eat
something. I&apos;m afraid many other Americans are facing this same
issue. Also, at just about every fast food restaurant it only costs
20 cents or 50 cents more to get extra large everything, which
seems like such a good deal that it&apos;s hard for most people to pass
up. But I think possibly the main issue, as you discussed, is that
so many foods are processed to the point of barely being considered
food. And there is so much high fructose corn syrup in just about
every food that it&apos;s a wonder we&apos;re not all diabetic. I read an
excellent article about it here:
http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/04/10/corn-fat.aspx
Great article, Sam!
 Posted 20 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
Hi Bella. I understand paycheck to paycheck and the $1
cheeseburgers. But is that all you get, just two cheeseburgers, add
up the $2 burgers for every meal and the amount adds up. People
have to learn to eat leftovers. If you were to cook a pot of chili
for 2 people, it would last at least several nights. Start looking
at your grocery store ads; they usually come out on Tuesday or
Wednesday. I wrote an article on here called“How to Eat
Healthy and Cheap”, take a look at it and see what prices you
come up with. I also wrote another article called“Healthy
and Cheap Lentil Stew Recipe”. Both articles could fit into
your budget better than those $1 cheeseburgers.
 Posted 20 months ago Bella Delanna 
That&apos;s also true, Sam...that brings up another topic of
Americans being especially impatient! When you&apos;re hungry, a $1
cheeseburger might still be more appealing than making a $1 pot of
chili (for example) since it&apos;s pretty much instant. That&apos;s another
point where processed food comes into play-- it makes for
convenience, which is what everything is striving for these days.
Planning meals ahead would definitely solve that problem. I&apos;ll
check out your articles. I actually made lentil stew this last
weekend, I&apos;m excited to check out your recipe!

One hypenated word: Crock-pot.
 Posted 20 months ago William J. Felchner 
Go to a restaurant, and there you will see the really obese
people. I&apos;m not talking a little overweight, but morbidly obese.
Cheese poured over french fries seems to be a favorite. I had a
family of four adults sitting near me last week, I bet their total
weight eclipsed 1,000 pounds easy. And there&apos;s no way they&apos;re going
to change their eating habits. We have a beautiful new all-weather
track at the local high school–open to the public. Just me
and a few other dedicated runners use it. I wish more people were
out there–they don&apos;t have to run, they could walk–but it&apos;s not happening. Hopefully, warmer weather will attract more
people. Personally, I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s 0 or 100 degrees, I&apos;m out
there because it&apos;s enjoyable (well, most of the time). I have no
idea what they&apos;re going to do about the burgeoning weight problem
in America, but it has and will continue to take its deadly health
and financial toll.

GREAT one Sam. Interesting from our perspective here in South
Africa - Michelle Obama is attracting a lot of interest with her
work in the WalMart scenario, as they will will be moving into SA
in this year.
 Posted 19 months ago Sam Montana Ranked #1 in Obesity 
Hi Colin, interesting to hear from South Africa. I am also
curious about the healthy food at Wal-mart. It will all be in the
ingredients. Michelle Obama is in a hard spot, promoting healthy
eating, organic foods and non-processed foods, yet she has to be
careful because so many big food companies have their lobbyists
that pressure congress and the President.
