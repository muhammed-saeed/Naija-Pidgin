 &quot;Last Tuesday, Ian picked from office after his 2nd day of work at Petron Plaza. We decided to have dinner at our house, but unfortunately my mom didn&apos;t cook for dinner that is why I make a decision to have dinner outside. Since it&apos;s our payday that time, I told Ian that I treat him but I will decide where we are going to eat. I&apos;ve been seeing this fun and catchy words of Chicken and Baboy, the so-called &quot;Chic-Boy&quot; restaurant, so we settled to try it. This restaurant offers the best Lechon Manok and Lechon Liempo. According to their website these two are marinated and stuffed with herb and spices and charcoal broiled to juicy and tasty perfection. It was only open last May 5 that is why the facilities were all in good conditions.&quot;

 &quot;I’ve long been craving for Balamban liempo ever since it’s been written about by some food bloggers, notably marketmanila. Pork belly or LIEMPO is one of my sinful joys and biting into the border where melt-in-your-mouth fat meets tender lean meat gives me one gustatory high!&quot;... read more

 I MET THE NEWEST CHIC-BOY IN TOWN 
&quot;The other night, I came face to face with the newest hot item in the metro- Chic-Boy . Located along Jupiter Street in Makati City and just beside Strumm&apos;s, Chic-Boy stands for Chicken and Baboy. A subsidiary of Pier One Bar and Grill , Chic-Boy opened its doors to the hungry public last May 5, 2010. According to their lovely Marketing Manager, Cat Juan, they even bought their lechon recipes from Cebu to ensure quality taste and ultimate customer satisfaction.&quot;... read more

 Chicken + Baboy = ChicBoy! 
&quot;Once in a while, I find it truly relaxing to unwind and to just enjoy simple dishes that is truly comforting. Such is the case when enjoying a plate of local grilled dishes such as Chicken Inasal , liempo (pork belly), sisig (sizzling minced pig ears) and a lot more. So what happens when you put together a wide array of delicious grilled meats while highlighting Chicken and Pork ( Baboy )? You then get Chic-Boy !&quot;... read more

 The Truth About Chic-Boy&apos;s 
&quot;I seldom go to non-froogie related food events. My friend iya was invited to this by Spanky Enriquez, and I actually just tagged along. All they told me was that chic-boy meant chicken and baboy. Okay, first of all, there I was in my semi-faker vegetarian mode in a food event dealing with liempo and chicken and thinking to myself—Hooha! Oh the hypocrisy of it all, but that’s not the point.&quot;... read more

Well blame the frequent airline promos and really good food finds, because they are on the top of my expense list!

 Chic-Boy: Lechon Craze in Makati 
 Being a fan of Cebu lechon, I have long been meaning to try the newest place that is making waves in the lechon manok industry: Chic-boy (interesting pun on the name, yes?). The minds behind Pier One Bar&amp;Resto opened its new branch in the bustling Jupiter Street of Makati. It offers two very tasty house specialties: Chicken Inasal and Roasted Pork Belly which are available in individual serving at Php99 each . A wallet-friendly meal as it comes with unlimited rice!

 Buhay Princesa: Chic-Boy 
Last Friday June 25, Irish treat us on her last day to work. I suggest we try CHIC-BOY located at Jupiter Makati after reading toj’s review. Chic-Boy is short of chicken and baboy which refers to the food they serve. Food was superb ! It really tastes great and very affordable. What I like most is their service, super fast like we did not wait long for the food to be served and the unlimited iced tea is overflowing . They refill your glass even if you just take 2-3 sips and the meal also comes with unlimited rice so our guys took advantage of it. Chic-Boy has san-mig light and they are open 24 hours. So if you’re hungry and near the place go try it! .. .read more

 B!tch On A Budget: Chicboy 
Eating at Chicboy (in short for: Chicken&amp;Baboy)at 112 Jupiter St., Bel-Air, Makati felt like I was back in Cebu again. Hearing that they offered Cebu liempo made me go gaga and stuck on a Wednesday morning traffic made me want it so badly. It was nearly fatal. I felt like a 5 year old kid begging her mother to buy her candies, only this time I’m 20ish longing for Liempo. Finding a quality and“perfect”Lechon Cebu in Manila seem rare, nothing can compare to that very tender and the right amount of saltiness you’d find in Lechon Cebu, in fact, even Anthony Bourdain agrees!... read more

 Pinoy Word of Mouth: Chic-Boy Chicken at Baboy Restaurant Makati City 
In my 31 years of eating, I&apos;ve tasted different types of lechon. Although not the best tasting lechon in the Philppines in my opinion, Cebu lechon still ranks on the top 5 of the best lechon variants in the Philippines. Being in Manila, it is a rarity to eat lechon in parties and small, regular, get togethers. In Mindanao or Cebu you get to eat it (served in whole) regularly. This is mainly because in Manila lechon is expensive. In Vismin its cheap. A group of ten can chip-in ad buy a whole lechon. In Davao last year I got to eat it almost monthly when served in whole and weekly on Sundays when I buy it just a block away from our house for only P250.00 per kilo. Here in Manila its P450.00 pr kilo... read more
