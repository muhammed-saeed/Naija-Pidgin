CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

[0001]This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent
 application Ser. No. 60/771,868 filed on Feb. 10, 2006, the disclosure of
 which is incorporated by reference herein.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002]The present invention relates to a nucleation process, and more
 particularly, to a method of inducing nucleation of a phase transition of
 a material wherein the material is initially brought to a temperature
 near or below a phase transition temperature and subsequently
 de-pressurized so as to induce nucleation of the material.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003]Controlling the generally random process of nucleation in the
 freezing stage of a lyophilization or freeze-drying process to both
 decrease processing time necessary to complete freeze-drying and to
 increase the product uniformity from vial-to-vial in the finished product
 would be highly desirable in the art. In a typical pharmaceutical
 freeze-drying process, multiple vials containing a common aqueous
 solution are placed on shelves that are cooled, generally at a controlled
 rate, to low temperatures. The aqueous solution in each vial is cooled
 below the thermodynamic freezing temperature of the solution and remains
 in a sub-cooled metastable liquid state until nucleation occurs.

[0004]The range of nucleation temperatures across the vials is distributed
 randomly between a temperature near the thermodynamic freezing
 temperature and some value significantly (e.g., up to about 30.degree.
 C.) lower than the thermodynamic freezing temperature. This distribution
 of nucleation temperatures causes vial-to-vial variation in ice crystal
 structure and ultimately the physical properties of the lyophilized
 product. Furthermore, the drying stage of the freeze-drying process must
 be excessively long to accommodate the range of ice crystal sizes and
 structures produced by the natural stochastic nucleation phenomenon.

[0005]Additives have been used to increase the nucleation temperature of
 sub-cooled solutions. These additives can take many forms. It is well
 known that certain bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae) synthesize
 proteins that help nucleate ice formation in sub-cooled aqueous
 solutions. Either the bacteria or their isolated proteins can be added to
 solutions to increase the nucleation temperature. Several inorganic
 additives also demonstrate a nucleating effect; the most common such
 additive is silver iodide, AgI. In general, any additive or contaminant
 has the potential to serve as a nucleating agent. Lyophilization vials
 prepared in environments containing high particulate levels will
 generally nucleate and freeze at a lower degree of sub-cooling than vials
 prepared in low particulate environments.

[0006]All the nucleating agents described above are labeled &quot;additives,&quot;
 because they change the composition of the medium in which they nucleate
 a phase transition. These additives are not typically acceptable or
 desirable for FDA regulated and approved freeze-dried pharmaceutical
 products. These additives also do not provide control over the time and
 temperature when the vials nucleate and freeze. Rather, the additives
 only operate to increase the average nucleation temperature of the vials.

[0007]Ice crystals can themselves act as nucleating agents for ice
 formation in sub-cooled aqueous solutions. In the &quot;ice fog&quot; method, a
 humid freeze-dryer is filled with a cold gas to produce a vapor
 suspension of small ice particles. The ice particles are transported into
 the vials and initiate nucleation when they contact the fluid interface.

[0008]The &quot;ice fog&quot; method does not control the nucleation of multiple
 vials simultaneously at a controlled time and temperature. In other
 words, the nucleation event does not occur concurrently or
 instantaneously within all vials upon introduction of the cold vapor into
 the freeze-dryer. The ice crystals will take some time to work their way
 into each of the vials to initiate nucleation, and transport times are
 likely to be different for vials in different locations within the
 freeze-dryer. For large scale industrial freeze-dryers, implementation of
 the &quot;ice fog&quot; method would require system design changes as internal
 convection devices may be required to assist a more uniform distribution
 of the &quot;ice fog&quot; throughout the freeze-dryer. When the freeze-dryer
 shelves are continually cooled, the time difference between when the
 first vial freezes and the last vial freezes will create a temperature
 difference between the vials, which will increase the vial-to-vial
 non-uniformity in freeze-dried products.

[0009]Vial pre-treatment by scoring, scratching, or roughening has also
 been used to lower the degree of sub-cooling required for nucleation. As
 with the other prior art methods, vial pre-treatment also does not impart
 any degree of control over the time and temperature when the individual
 vials nucleate and freeze, but instead only increases the average
 nucleation temperature of all vials.

[0010]Vibration has also been used to nucleate a phase transition in a
 metastable material. Vibration sufficient to induce nucleation occurs at
 frequencies above 10 kHz and can be produced using a variety of
 equipment. Often vibrations in this frequency range are termed
 &quot;ultrasonic,&quot; although frequencies in the range 10 kHz to 20 kHz are
 typically within the audible range of humans. Ultrasonic vibration often
 produces cavitation, or the formation of small gas bubbles, in a
 sub-cooled solution. In the transient or inertial cavitation regime, the
 gas bubbles rapidly grow and collapse, causing very high localized
 pressure and temperature fluctuations. The ability of ultrasonic
 vibration to induce nucleation in a metastable material is often
 attributed to the disturbances caused by transient cavitation. The other
 cavitation regime, termed stable or non-inertial, is characterized by
 bubbles that exhibit stable volume or shape oscillations without
 collapse. U.S. Patent Application 20020031577 A1 discloses that
 ultrasonic vibration can induce nucleation even in the stable cavitation
 regime, but no explanation of the phenomenon is offered. GB Patent
 Application 2400901A also discloses that the likelihood of causing
 cavitation, and hence nucleation, in a solution using vibrations with
 frequencies above 10 kHz may be increased by reducing the ambient
 pressure around the solution or dissolving a volatile fluid in the
 solution.

[0011]An electrofreezing method has also been used in the past to induce
 nucleation in sub-cooled liquids. Electrofreezing is generally
 accomplished by delivering relatively high electric fields (.about.1
 V/nm) in a continuous or pulsed manner between narrowly spaced electrodes
 immersed in a sub-cooled liquid or solution. Drawbacks associated with an
 electrofreezing process in typical lyophilization applications include
 the relative complexity and cost to implement and maintain, particularly
 for lyophilization applications using multiple vials or containers. Also,
 electrofreezing cannot be directly applied to solutions containing ionic
 species (e.g., NaCl).

[0012]Recently, there are studies that examine the concept of
 `vacuum-induced surface freezing` (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,684,524). In
 such `vacuum induced surface freezing`, vials containing an aqueous
 solution are loaded on a temperature controlled shelf in a freeze-dryer
 and held initially at about 10 degrees Celsius. The freeze-drying chamber
 is then evacuated to near vacuum pressure (e.g., 1 mbar) which causes
 surface freezing of the aqueous solutions to depths of a few millimeters.
 Subsequent release of vacuum and decrease of shelf temperature below the
 solution freezing point allows growth of ice crystals from the pre-frozen
 surface layer through the remainder of the solution. A major drawback for
 implementing this `vacuum induced surface freezing` process in a typical
 lyophilization application is the high risk of violently boiling or
 out-gassing the solution under stated conditions.

[0013]Improved control of the nucleation process can enable the freezing
 of all unfrozen pharmaceutical solution vials in a freeze-dryer to occur
 within a more narrow temperature and time range, thereby yielding a
 lyophilized product with greater uniformity from vial-to-vial.
 Controlling the minimum nucleation temperature can affect the ice crystal
 structure formed within the vial and allow for a greatly accelerated
 freeze-drying process.

[0014]Therefore, a need exists for controlling the random process of
 nucleation in various freezing processes including the freezing stage of
 a freeze-drying or lyophilization process to both decrease processing
 time necessary to complete freeze-drying and improve the product
 uniformity from vial-to-vial in the finished product. It would therefore
 be desirable to provide a process that possesses some, or preferably all,
 of the above characteristics.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0015]The present invention may be characterized as a method for inducing
 nucleation of a phase transition in a material, the method comprising the
 steps of bringing the material to a temperature near or below a phase
 transition temperature of the material and decreasing the pressure to
 induce nucleation of the phase transition in the material.

[0016]The invention may also be characterized as a method of controlling
 the freezing process of a material comprising the steps of: cooling the
 material at a prescribed cooling rate; rapidly decreasing the pressure to
 induce nucleation of freezing within the material; and continuing cooling
 of the nucleated material to a prescribed final temperature to freeze the
 material. Depressurization is initiated when the material or solution
 attains a desired nucleation temperature or at a desired time after
 initiation of the cooling step.

[0017]The invention may be further characterized as a solidification
 process comprising the steps of: cooling a material to a temperature near
 or below a phase transition temperature; rapidly decreasing the pressure
 proximate the material to induce nucleation within the material; and
 continuing cooling of the nucleated material to a prescribed final
 temperature to further solidification.

[0018]Finally, the invention may be characterized as a method of
 controlling the condensation process of a gas comprising the steps of:
 cooling the gas to a temperature near or below a phase transition
 temperature; rapidly decreasing the pressure to induce nucleation within
 the gas; and continuing cooling of the nucleated gas to a prescribed
 final temperature to condense the gas.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

[0019]The above and other aspects, features, and advantages of the present
 invention will be more apparent from the following, more detailed
 description thereof, presented in conjunction with the following
 drawings, wherein:

[0020]FIG. 1 is a graph depicting the temperature versus time plot of a
 solution undergoing a stochastic nucleation process and further showing
 the range of nucleation temperatures of the solution;

[0021]FIG. 2 is a graph depicting the temperature versus time plot of a
 solution undergoing an equilibrated cooling process with depressurized
 nucleation in accordance with the present methods; and

[0022]FIG. 3 is a graph depicting the temperature versus time plot of a
 solution undergoing a dynamic cooling process with depressurized
 nucleation in accordance with the present methods.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0023]Nucleation is the onset of a phase transition in a small region of a
 material. For example, the phase transition can be the formation of a
 crystal from a liquid. The crystallization process (i.e., formation of
 solid crystals from a solution) often associated with freezing of a
 solution starts with a nucleation event followed by crystal growth.

[0024]In the crystallization process, nucleation is the step where
 selected molecules dispersed in the solution or other material start to
 gather to create clusters in the nanometer scale as to become stable
 under the current operating conditions. These stable clusters constitute
 the nuclei. The clusters need to reach a critical size in order to become
 stable nuclei. Such critical size is usually dictated by the operating
 conditions such as temperature, contaminants, degree of supersaturation,
 etc. and can vary from one sample of the solution to another. It is
 during the nucleation event that the atoms in the solution arrange in a
 defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure.

[0025]Crystal growth is the subsequent growth of the nuclei that succeed
 in achieving the critical cluster size. Depending upon the conditions
 either nucleation or crystal growth may predominate over the other, and
 as a result, crystals with different sizes and shapes are obtained.
 Control of crystal size and shape constitutes one of the main challenges
 in industrial manufacturing, such as for pharmaceuticals.

[0026]The present method relates to a process for controlling the time
 and/or temperature at which a nucleated phase transition occurs in a
 material. In freezing applications, the probability that a material will
 spontaneously nucleate and begin changing phase is related to the degree
 of sub-cooling of the material and the absence or presence of
 contaminants, additives, structures, or disturbances that provide a site
 or surface for nucleation.

[0027]The freezing or solidification step is particularly important in the
 freeze-drying process where existing techniques result in nucleation
 temperature differences across a multitude of vials or containers. The
 nucleation temperature differences tend to produce a non-uniform product
 and an excessively long drying time. The present methods, on the other
 hand, provide a higher degree of process control in batch solidification
 processes (e.g., freeze-drying) and produce a product with more uniform
 structure and properties. Unlike some of the prior art techniques to
 induce nucleation, the present methods require minimal equipment and
 operational changes for implementation.

[0028]In principle, the present methods can be applied to any material
 processing step that involves a nucleated phase transition. Examples of
 such processes include the freezing of a liquid, crystallization of ice
 from an aqueous solution, crystallization of polymers and metals from
 melts, crystallization of inorganic materials from supersaturated
 solutions, crystallization of proteins, artificial snow production,
 deposition of ice from vapor, food freezing, freeze concentration,
 fractional crystallization, cryopreservation, or condensation of vapors
 to liquids. From a conceptual standpoint, the present methods may also be
 applied to phase transitions such as melting and boiling.

[0029]The presently disclosed method represents an improvement to current
 pharmaceutical lyophilization processes. For example, within a large
 industrial freeze-dryer there can be over 100,000 vials containing a
 pharmaceutical product that needs to be frozen and dried. Current
 practice in the industry is to cool the solution to a very high degree so
 that the solution in all vials or containers in the freeze-dryer are
 guaranteed to freeze. The content of each vial or container, however,
 freezes randomly over a range of temperatures below the freezing point,
 because the nucleation process is uncontrolled.

[0030]Turning now to the Figures, and in particular FIG. 1, there is
 depicted a temperature versus time plot of six vials of an aqueous
 solution undergoing a conventional stochastic nucleation process showing
 the typical range of nucleation temperatures of the solution within the
 vials (11,12,13,14,15, and 16). As seen therein, the vial contents have a
 thermodynamic freezing temperature of about 0.degree. C. yet the solution
 within each vial naturally nucleates over the broad temperature range of
 about -7.degree. C. to -20 C. or more, as highlighted by area 18. Plot 19
 represents the shelf temperature inside the freeze-drying chamber.

[0031]Conversely, FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 depict temperature versus time plots
 of a solution undergoing a freezing process with depressurized nucleation
 in accordance with the present methods. In particular, FIG. 2 shows the
 temperature versus time plot of six vials of an aqueous solution
 undergoing an equilibrated cooling process (See Example 2) with
 nucleation induced via depressurization of the chamber (21,22,23,24,25,
 and 26). The vial contents have a thermodynamic freezing temperature of
 about 0.degree. C. yet the solution within each vial nucleates at the
 same time upon depressurization and within a very narrow temperature
 range (i.e., -40.degree. C. to -5.degree. C.) as seen in area 28. Plot 29
 represents the shelf temperature inside the freeze-drying chamber and
 depicts an equilibrated freezing process, one where the temperature of
 the shelves is held more or less steady prior to depressurization.

[0032]Similarly, FIG. 3 shows the temperature versus time plot of three
 vials of an aqueous solution undergoing a dynamic cooling process (See
 Example 7) with nucleation induced via depressurization of the chamber
 (31,32, and 33). Again, the vial contents have a thermodynamic freezing
 temperature of about 0.degree. C. yet the solution within each vial
 nucleates at the same time upon depressurization at a temperature range
 of about -7.degree. C. to -10.degree. C. as seen in area 38. Plot 39
 represents the shelf temperature inside the freeze-drying chamber and
 generally depicts a dynamic cooling process, one where the temperature of
 the shelves is actively lowered during or prior to depressurization.

[0033]As illustrated in the Figures, the present methods provide improved
 control of the nucleation process by enabling the freezing of
 pharmaceutical solutions in a freeze-dryer to occur within a more narrow
 temperature range (e.g., about 0.degree. C. to -10.degree. C.) and/or
 concurrently, thereby yielding a lyophilized product with greater
 uniformity from vial-to-vial. While not demonstrated, it is foreseeable
 that the induced nucleation temperature range may even extend slightly
 above the phase transition temperature and may also extend to about
 40.degree. C. of sub-cooling.

[0034]Another benefit associated with the present methods is that by
 controlling the lowest nucleation temperature and/or the precise time of
 nucleation one can affect the ice crystal structure formed within the
 frozen vials or containers. The ice crystal structure is a variable that
 affects the time it takes for the ice to sublimate. Thus, by controlling
 the ice crystal structure, it is possible to greatly accelerate the
 overall freeze-drying process.

[0035]In a broad sense, the presently disclosed methods for inducing
 nucleation of a phase transition within material comprise the steps of:
 (i) cooling the material to a temperature near or below a phase
 transition temperature of the material; and (ii) rapidly decreasing the
 pressure to induce nucleation of the material. Each of these important
 steps will be discussed in more detail below.

Step 1--Cooling The Material

[0036]Illustrative materials useful in the present method include pure
 substances, gases, suspensions, gels, liquids, solutions, mixtures, or
 components within a solution or mixture. Suitable materials for use in
 the present method may include, for example, pharmaceutical materials,
 biopharmaceutical materials, foodstuffs, chemical materials, and may
 include products such as wound-care products, cosmetics, veterinary
 products and in vivo/in vitro diagnostics related products and the like.
 When the material is a liquid, it may be desirable to dissolve gases into
 the liquid. Liquids in a controlled gas environment will generally have
 gases dissolved in them.

[0037]Other illustrative materials useful in the present method include
 biological or biopharmaceutical material such as tissues, organs and
 multi-cellular structures. For certain biological and pharmaceutical
 applications, the material may be a solution or mixture that includes: a
 live or attenuated viruses; nucleic acids; monoclonal antibodies;
 polyclonal antibodies; biomolecules; nonpeptide analogues; peptides,
 including polypeptides, peptide mimetics and modified peptides; proteins,
 including fusion and modified proteins; RNA, DNA and subclasses thereof;
 oligonucleotides; viral particles; and similar such materials or
 components thereof.

[0038]Pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical solutions contained in vials or
 containers for freeze-drying would be a good example of a material that
 would benefit from the present method. The solutions are mostly water and
 are substantially incompressible. Such pharmaceutical or
 biopharmaceutical solutions are also highly pure and generally free of
 particulates that may form sites for nucleation. Uniform nucleation
 temperature is important to creating a consistent and uniform ice crystal
 structure from vial to vial or container to container. The ice crystal
 structure developed also greatly affects the time required for drying.

[0039]As applied to a freeze-drying process, the material is preferably
 placed in a chamber, such as a freeze-drying chamber. Preferably, the
 chamber is configured so as to allow control of the temperature,
 pressure, and gas atmosphere within the chamber. The gas atmosphere may
 include, but is not limited to: argon, nitrogen, helium, air, water
 vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric
 oxide, neon, xenon, krypton, methane, hydrogen, propane, butane, and the
 like, including permissible mixtures thereof. The preferred gas
 atmosphere comprises an inert gas, such as argon, at a pressure between
 about 7 to about 50 psig or more. Temperatures within the freeze-dryer
 chamber are often dictated by the freeze-drying process and are easily
 controlled via the use of a heat transfer fluid that cools or warms the
 shelves within the chamber to drive the temperature of the vials or
 containers and the material within each vial or container.

[0040]In accordance with the present methods, the material is cooled to a
 temperature near or below its phase transition temperature. In the case
 of an aqueous based solution undergoing a freeze-drying process, the
 phase transition temperature is the thermodynamic freezing point of the
 solution. Where the solution reaches temperatures below the thermodynamic
 freezing point of the solution, it is said to be sub-cooled. When applied
 to a freezing process of an aqueous-based solution, the present method is
 effective when the degree of sub-cooling ranges from near or below the
 phase transition temperature up to about 40.degree. C. of sub-cooling,
 and more preferably between about 3.degree. C. of sub-cooling and
 10.degree. C. of sub-cooling. In some of the examples described below,
 the present method of inducing nucleation works desirably even where the
 solution has only about 1.degree. C. of sub-cooling below its
 thermodynamic freezing point.

[0041]Where the material is at a temperature below its phase transition
 temperature, it is often referred to as being in a metastable state. A
 metastable state is an unstable and transient, but relatively long-lived,
 state of a chemical or biological system. A metastable material
 temporarily exists in a phase or state that is not its equilibrium phase
 or state. In the absence of any changes in the material or its
 environment, a metastable material will eventually transition from its
 non-equilibrium state to its equilibrium state. Illustrative metastable
 materials include super-saturated solutions and sub-cooled liquids.

[0042]A typical example of a metastable material would be liquid water at
 atmospheric pressure and a temperature of -10.degree. C. With a normal
 freezing point of 0.degree. C., liquid water should not thermodynamically
 exist at this temperature and pressure, but it can exist in the absence
 of a nucleating event or structure to begin the ice crystallization
 process. Extremely pure water can be cooled to very low temperatures
 (-30.degree. C. to -40.degree. C.) at atmospheric pressure and still
 remain in the liquid state. Such sub-cooled water is in a
 non-equilibrated thermodynamically metastable state. It only lacks a
 nucleation event to cause it to begin the phase transition whereby it
 will return to equilibrium.

[0043]As discussed above, the present methods of inducing nucleation of a
 phase transition within a material or freezing a material can be utilized
 with various cooling profiles, including, for example, an equilibrated
 cooling environment or a dynamic cooling environment (See FIGS. 2 and 3).

Step 2--Rapidly Decreasing The Pressure

[0044]When the material has reached the desired temperature near or below
 the phase transition temperature, the chamber is quickly or rapidly
 depressurized. This depressurization triggers the nucleation and phase
 transition of the solution within the vials or containers. In the
 preferred embodiment, chamber depressurization is accomplished by opening
 or partially opening a large control valve that separates the high
 pressure chamber from either the ambient environment or a lower pressure
 chamber or environment. The elevated pressure is quickly lowered by mass
 flow of gas atmosphere out of the chamber. The depressurization needs to
 be fairly fast to induce the nucleation. The depressurization should be
 finished in several seconds or less, preferably 40 seconds or less, more
 preferably 20 seconds or less, and most preferably 10 seconds or less.

[0045]In typical freeze-drying applications, the pressure difference
 between the initial chamber pressure and the final chamber pressure,
 after depressurization, should be greater than about 7 psi, although
 smaller pressure drops may induce nucleation in some situations. Most
 commercial freeze-dryers can readily accommodate the range of pressure
 drops needed to control nucleation. Many freeze-dryers are designed with
 pressure ratings in excess of 25 psig to withstand conventional
 sterilization procedures employing saturated steam at 121.degree. C. Such
 equipment ratings provide an ample window to induce nucleation following
 protocols that depressurize from starting pressures above ambient
 pressure or the pressure in the surrounding environment. The elevated
 pressure and subsequent depressurization can be achieved through any
 known means (e.g., pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical). In the preferred
 embodiments, operating pressures for the present methods should remain
 below the supercritical pressure of any applied gas, and subjecting the
 material to extreme low pressures (i.e., about 10 mTorr or less) should
 be avoided during nucleation of the material.

[0046]While not wishing to be bound to any particular mechanism, one
 possible mechanism to explain the controlled nucleation observed in the
 practice of the present method is that gases in solution in the material
 come out of solution upon depressurization and form bubbles that nucleate
 the material. An initial elevated pressure increases the concentration of
 dissolved gas in the solution. The rapid decrease in pressure after
 cooling reduces the gas solubility, and the subsequent release of gas
 from the sub-cooled solution triggers nucleation of the phase transition.

[0047]Another possible mechanism is that the temperature decrease of the
 gas proximate the material during depressurization causes a cold spot on
 the surface of the material that initiates nucleation. Another possible
 mechanism is that the depressurization causes evaporation of some liquid
 in the material and the resultant cooling from the endothermic
 evaporation process may initiate the nucleation. Another possible
 mechanism is that the depressurized cold gas proximate the material
 freezes some vapor either in equilibrium with the material prior to
 depressurization or liberated from the material by evaporation during
 depressurization; the resultant solid particles re-enter the material and
 act as seeds or surfaces to initiate nucleation. One or more of these
 mechanisms may contribute to initiation of nucleation of freezing or
 solidification to differing extents depending on the nature of the
 material, its environment and the phase transition being nucleated.

[0048]The process may be carried out entirely at a pressure greater than
 ambient pressure or over a range of pressures spanning ambient pressure.
 For example, initial chamber pressure can be above ambient pressure and
 the final chamber pressure, after depressurization, can be above ambient
 pressure but less than the initial chamber pressure; the initial chamber
 pressure can be above ambient pressure and the final chamber pressure,
 after depressurization, can be about ambient pressure or slightly below
 ambient pressure.

[0049]The rate and magnitude of the pressure drop are also believed to be
 an important aspect of the present methods. Experiments have shown that
 nucleation will be induced where the pressure drop (.DELTA.P) is greater
 than about 7 psi. Alternatively, the magnitude of the pressure drop may
 be expressed as an absolute pressure ratio, R=P.sub.i/P.sub.f, where
 P.sub.i is initial absolute pressure and P.sub.f is final absolute
 pressure. It is believed that nucleation may be induced upon
 depressurization where the absolute pressure ratio, R, is greater than
 about 1.2 in many practical applications of the present methods. The rate
 of pressure drop also plays an important role in the present methods. One
 method of characterizing the rate of pressure drop is through use of a
 parameter, A, where A=.DELTA.P/.DELTA.t. Again, it is surmised that
 nucleation will be induced for values of A greater than a prescribed
 value, such as about 0.2 psi/sec. Empirical data through experimentation
 should aid one to ascertain the preferred pressure drop and rate of
 pressure drop.

[0050]The following examples highlight various aspects and features of the
 presently disclosed methods of inducing nucleation in a material and are
 not to be taken in a limiting sense. Rather, these examples are
 illustrative only and the scope of the invention should be determined
 only with respect to the claims, appended hereto.

EXAMPLES

[0051]All examples described herein were performed in a pilot-scale VirTis
 51-SRC freeze-dryer having four shelves with approximately 1.0 m.sup.2
 total shelf space and an internal condenser. This unit was retrofitted to
 hold positive pressures of up to about 15 psig. A 1.5&apos;&apos; diameter circular
 opening also was added to the rear wall of the freeze-drying chamber with
 1.5&apos;&apos; diameter stainless steel tubing extending from the hole through the
 rear wall insulation to emerge from the back of the freeze-dryer. Two
 1.5&apos;&apos; full-port, air-actuated ball valves were attached to this tubing
 via sanitary fittings. One ball valve allowed gas to flow into the
 freeze-drying chamber and thereby provide positive pressures up to 15
 psig. The second ball valve allowed gas to flow out of the freeze-drying
 chamber and thereby reduce chamber pressure to atmospheric conditions (0
 psig). All refrigeration of the freeze-dryer shelves and condenser was
 accomplished via circulation of Dynalene MV heat transfer fluid cooled by
 liquid nitrogen using the Praxair NCool.TM.-HX system.

[0052]All solutions were prepared in a class 100 clean room. The
 freeze-dryer was positioned with the door, shelves, and controls all
 accessible from the clean room while the other components (pumps,
 heaters, etc.) were located in a non-clean room environment. All
 solutions were prepared with HPLC grade water (Fisher Scientific,
 filtered through 0.10 .mu.m membrane). The final solutions were filtered
 through a 0.22 .mu.m membrane prior to filling the vials or
 lyophilization containers. All gases were supplied via cylinders and were
 filtered through 0.22 .mu.m filters to remove particulates. The glass
 containers (5 mL vials and 60 mL bottles) were obtained pre-cleaned for
 particulates from Wheaton Science Products. Pharmaceutically acceptable
 carriers were used where appropriate. The above steps were taken to
 ensure the materials and methods met conventional pharmaceutical
 manufacturing standards for particulates, which act as nucleating agents.

[0053]As used herein, &quot;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&quot; includes any
 and all solvents, dispersion media, antioxidants, salts, coatings,
 surfactants, preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate,
 sorbic acid, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents,
 solution retarding agents (e.g., paraffin), absorbents (e.g., kaolin
 clay, bentonite clay), drug stabilizers (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate),
 gels, binders (e.g., syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth,
 polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carboxy-methyl-cellulose, alginates), excipients
 (e.g., lactose, milk sugar, polyethylene glycol), disintegration agent
 (e.g., agar-agar, starch, lactose, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate,
 alginic acid, sorbitol, glycine), wetting agents (e.g., cetyl alcohol,
 glycerol monostearate), lubricants, absorption accelerators (e.g.,
 quaternary ammonium salts), edible oils (e.g., almond oil, coconut oil,
 oily esters or propylene glycol), sweetening agents, flavoring agents,
 coloring agents, fillers, (e.g., starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose,
 mannitol), tabletting lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, starch,
 glucose, lactose, rice flower, chalk), carriers for inhalation (e.g.,
 hydrocarbon propellants), buffering agents, or such like materials and
 combinations thereof, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the
 art.

[0054]For the experimental conditions described herein and all
 lyophilization formulations studied, stochastic nucleation was typically
 observed to occur at container temperatures between about -8.degree. C.
 and -20.degree. C. and occasionally as warm as -5.degree. C. The
 containers could generally be held at temperatures warmer than -8.degree.
 C. for long periods of time without nucleating. The onset of nucleation
 and subsequent crystal growth (i.e., freezing) was determined by
 temperature measurement as the point at which the container temperature
 quickly increased in response to the exothermic latent heat of fusion.
 The initiation of freezing also could be visually determined through a
 sight-glass on the freeze-dryer chamber door.

Example 1

Controlling the Nucleation Temperature

[0055]Four separate vials were filled with 2.5 mL of 5 wt % mannitol
 solution. The predicted thermodynamic freezing point of the 5 wt %
 mannitol solution is approximately -0.5.degree. C. The four vials were
 placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one another. The
 temperatures of the four vials were monitored using surface mounted
 thermocouples. The freeze-dryer was pressurized with argon to 14 psig.

[0056]The freeze-dryer shelf was cooled to obtain vial temperatures of
 between approximately -1.3.degree. C. and about -2.3.degree. C.
 (.+-.1.degree. C. measurement accuracy of the thermocouples). The
 freeze-dryer was then depressurized from about 14 psig to about
 atmospheric pressure in less than five seconds to induce nucleation of
 the solution within the vials. All four vials nucleated and began
 freezing immediately after depressurization. Results are summarized in
 Table 1 below.

[0057]As seen in Table 1, the controlled nucleation temperatures in this
 example (i.e., Initial Vial Temperatures) are quite close to the
 predicted thermodynamic freezing point of the solution. Thus the present
 method allows control of the nucleation to occur in solutions that have a
 very low degree of sub-cooling or at nucleation temperatures near or only
 slightly colder than their freezing points.

Example 2

Controlling the Nucleation Temperature

[0058]In this example, ninety-five vials were filled with 2.5 mL of 5 wt %
 mannitol solution. The thermodynamic freezing point of the 5 wt %
 mannitol solution is approximately -0.5.degree. C. The ninety-five vials
 were placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one another.
 The temperatures of six vials positioned at different locations in the
 freeze-dryer shelf were continuously monitored using surface mounted
 thermocouples. The freeze-dryer was pressurized in an argon atmosphere to
 about 14 psig. The freeze-dryer shelf was then cooled to obtain vial
 temperatures of near -5.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was then
 depressurized from about 14 psig to about atmospheric pressure in less
 than five seconds to induce nucleation of the solution within the vials.
 All ninety-five vials were visually observed to nucleate and begin
 freezing immediately after depressurization. Thermocouple data for the
 six monitored vials confirmed the visual observation. The results are
 summarized in Table 2.

[0059]As seen therein, controlled nucleation temperatures in this example
 (i.e., Initial Vial Temperatures) are somewhat below the predicted
 thermodynamic freezing point of the solution. Thus the present method
 allows control of the nucleation to occur in solutions that have a
 moderate degree of sub-cooling. This example also demonstrates
 scalability of the present method to a multiple vial application.

Controlling the Depressurization Magnitude

[0060]In this example, multiple vials were filled with 2.5 mL of 5 wt %
 mannitol solution. Again, the predicted thermodynamic freezing point of
 the 5 wt % mannitol solution is approximately -0.5.degree. C. For each
 test run, the vials were placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close
 proximity to one another. As with the earlier described examples, the
 temperatures of vials were monitored using surface mounted thermocouples.
 The argon atmosphere in the freeze-dryer was pressurized to differing
 pressures and the freeze-dryer shelf was cooled to obtain vial
 temperatures of about -5.degree. C. In each test run, the freeze-dryer
 was then rapidly depressurized (i.e., in less than five seconds) from the
 selected pressure to atmospheric pressure in an effort to induce
 nucleation of the solution within the vials. Results are summarized in
 Table 3.

[0061]As seen in Table 3, the controlled nucleation occurred where the
 pressure drop was about 7 psi or greater and the nucleation temperature
 (i.e., initial vial temperature) was between about -4.7.degree. C. and
 -5.8.degree. C.

Example 4

Controlling the Depressurization Rates

[0062]For this example, multiple vials were filled with about 2.5 mL of 5
 wt % mannitol solution having a predicted thermodynamic freezing point of
 approximately -0.5.degree. C. For each test run of varying
 depressurization time, the vials were placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in
 close proximity to one another. As with the earlier described examples,
 the temperatures of vials were monitored using surface mounted
 thermocouples. Like the above-described examples, the argon atmosphere in
 the freeze-dryer was pressurized to about 14 psig and the shelf was
 cooled to obtain vial temperatures of approximately -5.degree. C. In each
 test run, the freeze-dryer was then depressurized at different
 depressurization rates from 14 psig to atmospheric pressure in an effort
 to induce nucleation of the solution within the vials.

[0063]To study the effect of depressurization rate or depressurization
 time, a restricting ball valve was placed on the outlet of the
 depressurization control valve at the rear of the freeze-dryer. When the
 restricting valve is completely open, depressurization from about 14 psig
 to about 0 psig is accomplished in approximately 2.5 seconds. By only
 partially closing the restricting valve, it is possible to variably
 increase the chamber depressurization time. Using the restricting ball
 valve, several test runs were performed with the freeze-dryer chamber
 depressurized at differing rates to ascertain or determine the effect of
 depressurization rate on nucleation. The results are summarized in Table
 4.

 24 2.5 mL of 5 wt % mannitol Argon -5.5 14 13 Nucleation

[0064]As seen in Table 4, nucleation only occurred where the
 depressurization time was less than 42 seconds, the pressure drop was
 about 14 psi or greater and the nucleation temperature (i.e., initial
 vial temperature) was between about -4.6.degree. C. and about
 -5.8.degree. C. These results indicate that the depressurization needs to
 be accomplished relatively quickly for the method to be effective.

Example 5

Controlling the Gas Atmosphere

[0065]Again, multiple vials were each filled with about 2.5 mL of 5 wt %
 mannitol solution and placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity
 to one another. As with earlier described examples, the temperature of
 the test vials were monitored using surface mounted thermocouples. For
 the different test runs, the gas atmosphere in the freeze-dryer was
 varied always maintaining a positive pressure of about 14 psig. In this
 example, the freeze-dryer shelf was cooled to obtain vial temperatures of
 approximately -5.degree. C. to -7.degree. C. In each test run, the
 freeze-dryer was then rapidly depressurized from about 14 psig to
 atmospheric pressure in an effort to induce nucleation of the solution
 within the vials. The results are summarized in Table 5.

[0066]As seen therein, controlled nucleation occurred in all gas
 atmospheres except for helium gas atmosphere where the pressure drop was
 about 14 psi and the nucleation temperature (i.e., initial vial
 temperature) was between about -4.7.degree. C. and about -7.4.degree. C.
 Although not shown in the examples, it is believed that alternate
 conditions will likely enable controlled nucleation in a helium
 atmosphere.

Large Volume Solutions

[0067]In this example, six lyophilization bottles (60 mL capacity) were
 filled with about 30 mL of 5 wt % mannitol solution having a predicted
 thermodynamic freezing point of approximately -0.5.degree. C. The six
 lyophilization bottles were placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close
 proximity to one another. The temperature of six bottles positioned at
 different locations in the freeze-dryer shelf was monitored using surface
 mounted thermocouples. The freeze-dryer was pressurized in an argon
 atmosphere to about 14 psig. The freeze-dryer shelf was then cooled to
 obtain bottle temperatures of near -5.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was
 then depressurized from 14 psig to about atmospheric pressure in less
 than five seconds to induce nucleation of the solution within the
 bottles. The results are summarized in Table 6.

[0068]In a separate experiment, a plastic bulk freeze-drying tray (Gore
 LYOGUARD, 1800 mL capacity) was filled with about 1000 mL of 5 wt %
 mannitol solution. The tray was obtained pre-cleaned to meet USP low
 particulate requirements. The tray was placed on a freeze-dryer shelf,
 and the temperature of the tray was monitored by a thermocouple mounted
 on the exterior surface of the tray near the center of one side. The
 freeze-dryer shelf was then cooled to obtain a tray temperature of near
 -7.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was then depressurized from 14 psig to
 about atmospheric pressure in less than five seconds to induce nucleation
 of the solution within the tray. The results are also summarized in Table
 6.

[0069]Like the above-described examples, all containers nucleated and
 began freezing immediately after depressurization. Also like the
 above-described examples, the nucleation temperatures (i.e., Container
 Temperatures) in this example were very much controllable to be somewhat
 near the thermodynamic freezing temperature of the solution. More
 importantly, this example illustrates that the present method allows
 control of the nucleation to occur in larger volume solutions and various
 container formats. It should be noted that one would expect the efficacy
 of the depressurization method to improve as formulation volume
 increases, because the nucleation event is more likely to occur when more
 molecules are present to aggregate and form critical nuclei.

Example 7

Dynamic Cooling vs. Equilibrated Cooling

[0070]The present methods of controlling nucleation can be used in various
 modes. Examples 1-6, described above, each demonstrate the aspect of
 controlling the nucleation temperature of a lyophilization solution that
 is essentially equilibrated at a temperature below its thermodynamic
 freezing point (i.e., very slowly changing temperature). This example
 demonstrates that nucleation can also occur at a temperature below the
 thermodynamic freezing point in a dynamic cooling environment (i.e., the
 solution is undergoing rapid changes in temperature).

[0071]In this example, vials 1 through 6 represent the samples described
 above with reference to Example 2. In addition, three separate vials
 (Vials 7-9) were also filled with 2.5 mL of 5 wt % mannitol solution. In
 a separate test run, the three additional vials were placed on a
 freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one another. The freeze-dryer
 shelf was cooled rapidly towards a final shelf temperature of -45.degree.
 C. When one of the vials reached a temperature of about -5.degree. C., as
 measured by the surface mounted thermocouples, the freeze-dryer was
 depressurized rapidly from about 14 psig to 0 psig in an effort to induce
 nucleation. All three vials nucleated and began freezing immediately
 after depressurization. The vial temperatures decreased significantly to
 between -6.8.degree. C. and -9.9.degree. C. prior to nucleation as a
 result of the dynamic cooling environment. Comparative results are
 summarized in Table 7 below.

[0072]The efficacy of the present methods for controlling nucleation in
 lyophilization solutions equilibrated in a given temperature range or
 lyophilization solutions being dynamically cooled, provides the end-user
 with two potential modes of application with different benefits and
 trade-offs. By allowing the lyophilization solutions to equilibrate, the
 range of nucleation temperatures will be narrow or minimized to the
 performance limits of the freeze-dryer itself. The equilibration step may
 require extra time to achieve relative to conventional or dynamic
 freezing protocols where the chamber and vial temperatures are dropped to
 less than about -40.degree. C. in one step. However, employing the
 equilibration step should yield much improved nucleation uniformity
 across all vials or containers as well as realization of the other
 benefits associated with precisely controlling the nucleation temperature
 of the material.

[0073]Alternatively, if equilibrating the material or lyophilization
 solution temperatures is undesirable, one may simply implement the
 depressurization step at an appropriate time during the normal freezing
 or dynamic cooling protocol. Depressurization during a dynamic cool down
 will produce a wider spread in nucleation temperatures for the material
 within the lyophilization containers, but will add minimal time to the
 freezing protocol and still allow one to mitigate the problems of extreme
 sub-cooling.

Example 8

Effect of Different Excipients

[0074]The present method of controlling or inducing nucleation in a
 material can be used to control the nucleation temperature of sub-cooled
 solutions containing different lyophilization excipients. This example
 demonstrates the use of the present methods with the following
 excipients: mannitol; hydroxyethyl starch (HES); polyethylene glycol
 (PEG); polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP); dextran; glycine; sorbitol; sucrose;
 and trehalose. For each excipient, two vials were filled with 2.5 mL of a
 solution containing 5 wt % of the excipient. The vials were placed on a
 freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one another. The freeze-dryer
 was pressurized in an argon atmosphere to about 14 psig. The freeze-dryer
 shelf was cooled to obtain vial temperatures near -3.degree. C. and then
 depressurized rapidly to induce nucleation. Results are summarized in
 Table 8.

Example 9

Controlling Nucleation of Protein Solutions

[0075]The methods disclosed herein can be used to control the nucleation
 temperature of sub-cooled protein solutions without negative or adverse
 effects on protein solubility or enzymatic activity. Two proteins, bovine
 serum albumin (BSA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were used in this
 example.

[0076]BSA was dissolved in 5 wt % mannitol at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.
 Three lyophilization vials were filled with 2.5 mL of the BSA-mannitol
 solution and placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one
 another. The freeze-dryer was pressurized in an argon atmosphere to about
 14 psig. The freeze-dryer shelf was cooled to obtain vial temperatures
 near -5.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was depressurized rapidly to induce
 nucleation. All vials of BSA solution nucleated and began freezing
 immediately after depressurization. No precipitation of the protein was
 observed upon thawing.

[0077]The LDH proteins were obtained from two different suppliers and for
 purposes of clarity are designated as LDH-1 or LDH-2 to distinguish the
 two distinct batches. LDH-1 was dissolved in 5 wt % mannitol at a
 concentration of 1 mg/mL. Six lyophilization vials were filled with 2.5
 mL of the LDH-1/mannitol solution and placed on a freeze-dryer shelf in
 close proximity to one another. The freeze-dryer was pressurized in an
 argon atmosphere to about 14 psig. The freeze-dryer shelf was cooled
 starting from room temperature to obtain vial temperatures near
 -4.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was then depressurized rapidly to induce
 nucleation. All vials nucleated and began freezing immediately after
 depressurization. The vials were held at this state for about 15 minutes.
 The freeze-dryer shelf was then cooled at a rate of approximately
 1.degree. C./min to obtain vial temperatures near -45.degree. C. and held
 for an additional 15 minutes to ensure completion of the freezing
 process. After the freezing step, the freeze-dryer shelf was then warmed
 at a rate of about 1.degree. C./min to raise the vial temperatures to
 near 5.degree. C. No precipitation of the protein was observed upon
 thawing. The vial contents were assayed for enzymatic activity, and the
 results were compared to a control sample of unfrozen LDH-1/mannitol
 solution.

[0078]As part of Example 9, the depressurized nucleated samples of the
 LDH-1/mannitol solution were compared to stochastically nucleated
 samples. In the stochastically nucleated samples of LDH-1, the freezing
 procedure was repeated without pressurization and depressurization and
 without the argon atmosphere. Specifically, LDH-1 was dissolved in 5 wt %
 mannitol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Six lyophilization vials were
 filled with 2.5 mL of the LDH-1/mannitol solution and placed on a
 freeze-dryer shelf in close proximity to one another. The freeze-dryer
 shelf was cooled starting from room temperature at a rate of about
 1.degree. C./min to obtain vial temperatures near -45.degree. C. and held
 for 15 minutes to ensure completion of the freezing process. After the
 freezing step, the freeze-dryer shelf was warmed at a rate of about
 1.degree. C./min to raise the vial temperatures to near 5.degree. C. No
 precipitation of the protein was observed upon thawing. The vial contents
 were assayed for enzymatic activity, and the results were compared to the
 same control sample of unfrozen LDH-1/mannitol solution. Also as part of
 Example 9, the experiments described above for LDH-1 were repeated using
 LDH-2. The only difference was a nucleation temperature near -3.degree.
 C. for LDH-2 rather than -4.degree. C. for LDH-1.

[0079]As seen in Table 9, the controlled nucleation and freezing process
 achieved via depressurization clearly does not decrease enzymatic
 activity relative to a comparable stochastic nucleation and freezing
 protocol. In fact, the controlled nucleation process achieved via
 depressurization appears to better preserve enzyme activity with a mean
 activity loss of only 17.8% for LDH-1 and 26.5% for LDH-2 compared to the
 mean activity loss of 35.9% for LDH-1 and 41.3% for LDH-2 after
 stochastic nucleation.

[0080]It should be noted that the stochastic nucleation temperatures
 observed for LDH-2 were substantially warmer than the stochastic
 nucleation temperatures for LDH-1. This difference may be due to some
 contaminant acting as a nucleating agent in the LDH-2. The stochastic
 nucleation temperatures are much closer to the controlled nucleation
 temperatures for LDH-2 compared to LDH-1, yet the improvements in
 retention of enzyme activity obtained via controlled nucleation for LDH-1
 and LDH-2 are similar at 18.1% and 14.8%, respectively. This result
 suggests that the improvements in retention of enzyme activity can be
 partially attributed to the characteristics of the controlled nucleation
 process itself, not just to the prescribed warmer nucleation temperatures
 obtained via depressurization.

Example 10

Reducing Primary Drying Time

[0081]A 5 wt % mannitol solution was prepared by mixing about 10.01 grams
 of mannitol with about 190.07 grams of water. Vials were filled with 2.5
 mL of the 5 wt % mannitol solution. The vials were weighed empty and with
 the solution to determine the mass of water added to the vials. The
 twenty vials were placed in a rack on a freeze-dryer shelf in close
 proximity to one another. The temperatures of six vials were monitored
 using surface mounted thermocouples; all monitored vials were surrounded
 by other vials to improve uniformity of vial behavior. The freeze-dryer
 was pressurized to about 14 psig in a controlled gas atmosphere of argon
 gas. The freeze-dryer shelf was cooled from room temperature to about
 -6.degree. C. to obtain vial temperatures of between approximately
 -1.degree. C. and -2.degree. C. The freeze-dryer was then depressurized
 from about 14 psig to about atmospheric pressure in less than five
 seconds to induce nucleation of the solution within the vials. All vials
 observed visually or monitored via thermocouples nucleated and began
 freezing immediately after depressurization.

[0082]The shelf temperature was then lowered rapidly to about -45.degree.
 C. to complete the freezing process. Once all vial temperatures were
 about -40.degree. C. or less, the freeze-drying chamber was evacuated and
 the process of primary drying (i.e., sublimation) was initiated. During
 this drying process, the freeze-dryer shelf was warmed to about
 -14.degree. C. via a one hour ramp and held at that temperature for 16
 hours. The condenser was maintained at about -60.degree. C. throughout
 the drying process. Primary drying was stopped by turning off the vacuum
 pump and backfilling the chamber with argon to atmospheric pressure. The
 vials were promptly removed from the freeze-dryer and weighed to
 determine how much water was lost during the primary drying process.

[0083]In a separate experiment as part of Example 10, other vials were
 filled with 2.5 mL of the same 5 wt % mannitol solution. The vials were
 weighed empty and with the solution to determine the mass of water added
 to the vials. The vials were loaded into the freeze-dryer in the same
 manner described above, and the temperatures of six vials were once again
 monitored using surface-mounted thermocouples. The freeze-dryer shelf was
 cooled rapidly from room temperature to about -45.degree. C. to freeze
 the vials. Nucleation occurred stochastically between about -15.degree.
 C. and about -18.degree. C. during the cooling step. Once all vials
 temperatures were about -40.degree. C. or less, the vials were dried in a
 manner identical to the method described above. Upon conclusion of
 primary drying, the samples were promptly removed from the freeze-dryer
 and weighed to determine how much water was lost during the primary
 drying process.

[0084]Results of the freeze-drying process with controlled nucleation and
 stochastic nucleation are summarized in Table 10. It should be noted that
 these two experiments only differ in the addition of the controlled
 nucleation via depressurization step to one experiment. As seen in Table
 10, the controlled nucleation process achieved via depressurization
 allows nucleation at very low degrees of sub-cooling, between about
 -1.1.degree. C. and -2.3.degree. C. in this example. The much warmer
 nucleation temperatures for the controlled nucleation case compared to
 the stochastic nucleation case yields an ice structure and resultant
 lyophilized cake with dramatically improved drying properties. For the
 same amount of drying time, the vials nucleated using the disclosed
 depressurization methods between about -1.1.degree. C. and -2.3.degree.
 C. lost an average of 86.1% of their water while the vials nucleated
 stochastically between about -14.5.degree. C. and -17.9.degree. C. only
 lost an average of 65.3%. Hence, the vials nucleated stochastically would
 require much more primary drying time to achieve the same degree of water
 loss as the vials nucleated in a controlled manner in accordance with the
 presently disclosed methods. The improvement in drying time is likely
 attributed to the formation of larger ice crystals at warmer nucleation
 temperatures. These larger ice crystals leave behind larger pores upon
 sublimation, and the larger pores offer less resistance to the flow of
 water vapor during further sublimation.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY

[0085]The present method provides an improved method for controlling the
 temperature and/or time at which sub-cooled materials, namely liquids or
 solutions, nucleate and then freeze. Although this application focuses in
 part on freeze-drying, a similar problem occurs for any material
 processing step that involves a nucleated phase transition. Examples of
 such processes include the crystallization of polymers and metals from
 melts, crystallization of materials from supersaturated solutions,
 crystallization of proteins, artificial snow production, food freezing,
 freeze concentration, fractional crystallization, cryo-preservation, or
 condensation of vapors to liquids.

[0086]The most immediate benefit of controlling the nucleation temperature
 of a liquid or solution is the ability to control the number and size of
 the solid domains produced by the phase transition. In freezing water,
 for example, the nucleation temperature directly controls the size and
 number of ice crystals formed. Generally speaking, the ice crystals are
 fewer in number and larger in size when the nucleation temperature is
 warmer.

[0087]The ability to control the number and size of the solid domains
 produced by a phase transition may provide additional benefits. In a
 freeze-drying process, for example, the number and size of the ice
 crystals strongly influences the drying properties of the lyophilized
 cake. Larger ice crystals produced by warmer nucleation temperatures
 leave behind larger pores upon sublimation, and the larger pores offer
 less resistance to the flow of water vapor during subsequent sublimation.
 Hence, the present methods provide a means of increasing primary drying
 (i.e., sublimation) rates in freeze-drying processes by increasing the
 nucleation temperature.

[0088]Another possible benefit may be realized in applications where
 sensitive materials are preserved via freezing processes (i.e.,
 cryopreserved). For example, a biological material including but not
 limited to, mammalian tissue samples (e.g., cord blood, tissue biopsy,
 egg and sperm cells, etc.), cell lines (e.g., mammalian, yeast,
 prokaryotic, fungal, etc.) and biological molecules (e.g., proteins, DNA,
 RNA and subclasses thereof) frozen in an aqueous solution may experience
 various stresses during the freezing process that may impair the function
 or activity of the material. Ice formation may physically disrupt the
 material or create severe changes in the interfacial bonding, osmotic
 forces, solute concentrations, etc. experienced by the material. Since
 nucleation controls the structure and kinetics of ice formation, it can
 significantly influence these stresses. The presently disclosed methods
 therefore provides a unique means of mitigating stresses associated with
 cryopreservation processes and enhancing the recovery of function or
 activity from cryopreserved materials. The present methods also represent
 improvement over conventional nucleation control methods (e.g., seeding
 or contact with cold surfaces) used to initiate extracellular ice
 formation in two-step cryopreservation algorithms designed for living
 cells.

[0089]The present methods may be also applied to complex solutions or
 mixtures containing several constituents both in cryopresevation and
 lyophilization applications. These formulations are often solutions with
 an aqueous, organic, or mixed aqueous-organic solvent containing a
 pharmaceutically active ingredient (e.g., a synthetic chemical, protein,
 peptide, or vaccine) and optionally, one or more mitigating constituents,
 including bulking agents that help prevent physical loss of the active
 ingredient during drying (e.g., dextrose, glucose, glycine, lactose,
 maltose, mannitol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium chloride, and sorbitol);
 buffering agents or toxicity modifiers that help maintain the appropriate
 environmental pH or toxicity for the active constituent (e.g., acetic
 acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, lactic acid, maleic
 acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, and the sodium salts of the
 aforementioned acids); stabilizing agents that help preserve the
 structure and function of the active constituent during processing or in
 its final liquid or dried form (e.g., alanine, dimethylsulfoxide,
 glycerol, glycine, human serum albumin, polyethylene glycol, lysine,
 polysorbate, sorbitol, sucrose, and trehalose); agents that modify the
 glass transition behavior of the formulation (e.g., polyethylene glycol
 and sugars), and anti-oxidants that protect the active constituent from
 degradation (e.g., ascorbate, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde,
 sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, sulfoxylate, and thioglycerol).

[0090]Since nucleation is typically a random process, a plurality of the
 same material subjected to identical processing conditions might nucleate
 at different temperatures. As a result, the properties of those materials
 that depend on nucleation behavior will likely differ despite the
 identical processing conditions. The disclosed methods provide a means
 for controlling the nucleation temperatures of a plurality of materials
 simultaneously and thereby offers a way to increase the uniformity of
 those product properties that depend on nucleation behavior. In a typical
 freeze-drying process, for example, the same solution in separate vials
 may nucleate stochastically over a wide range of temperatures, and as a
 result, the final freeze-dried products may possess significant
 variability in critical properties like residual moisture, activity and
 reconstitution time. By controlling the nucleation temperature via the
 presently disclosed process, the vial-to-vial uniformity of product
 properties from a freeze-drying can process can be dramatically improved.

[0091]The ability to control the nucleation behavior of a material may
 also provide substantial benefit in reducing the time necessary to
 develop an industrial process that hinges upon a normally uncontrolled
 nucleation event. For example, it often takes many months to develop a
 successful freeze-drying cycle that can be accomplished in a reasonable
 amount of time, yields desired product properties within the specified
 uniformity, and preserves sufficient activity of the active
 pharmaceutical ingredient (API). By providing a means of controlling
 nucleation and thereby potentially improving primary drying time, product
 uniformity, and API activity, the present methods should dramatically
 reduce the time necessary to develop successful freeze-drying protocols.

[0092]In particular, the potential benefits of the present nucleation
 process provide increased flexibility in specifying the composition of
 the formulation to be freeze-dried. Since controlled nucleation can
 better preserve the API during the freezing step, users should be able to
 minimize the addition of mitigating constituents (e.g., stabilizing
 agents) to the formulation or chose simpler combinations of formulation
 constituents to achieve combined stability and processing goals.
 Synergistic benefits may arise in cases where controlled nucleation
 minimizes the use of stabilizing agents or other mitigating constituents
 that inherently lengthen primary drying times (e.g, by decreasing glass
 transition temperatures of aqueous solutions).

[0093]The disclosed methods are particularly well-suited for large scale
 production or manufacturing operations since it can be conducted using
 the same equipment and process parameters that can easily be scaled or
 adapted to manufacture a wide range of products. The process provides for
 the nucleation of materials using a process where all manipulations can
 be carried out in a single chamber (e.g., a freeze-dryer) and where the
 process does not require use of a vacuum, use of additives, vibration,
 electrofreezing or the like to induce nucleation.

[0094]In contrast to the prior art, the present method does not add
 anything to the lyophilized product. It only requires that the materials,
 (e.g., liquids in the vials), be held initially at a specified pressure
 under a gas environment and that the pressure is rapidly reduced to a
 lower pressure. Any applied gas will be removed from the vials during the
 lyophilization cycle. The vials or their contents are not contacted or
 touched with anything except the gas. Simple manipulation of the ambient
 pressure and gas environment is sufficient on its own to achieve that
 goal. By relying only on ambient pressure change to induce nucleation,
 the present method disclosed herein uniformly and simultaneously affects
 all vials within a freeze-dryer.

[0095]The present embodiment is also less expensive and easier to
 implement and maintain than prior art methods of influencing nucleation
 in materials in lyophilization applications. The present method enables
 significantly faster primary drying in lyophilization processes, thereby
 reducing processing costs for freeze-dried pharmaceuticals. The present
 method produces much more uniform lyophilized products than prior art
 methods, thereby reducing product losses and creating barriers to entry
 for processors unable to meet tighter uniformity specifications. This
 method achieves these benefits without contaminating the lyophilized
 product. Greater process control should lead to an improved product and
 shortened process times.

[0096]From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the present
 invention thus provides a method of inducing nucleation in a material
 and/or a method of freezing material. Various modifications, changes, and
 variations of the present methods will be apparent to a person skilled in
 the art and it is to be understood that such modifications, changes, and
 variations are to be included within the purview of this application and
 the spirit and scope of the claims.
