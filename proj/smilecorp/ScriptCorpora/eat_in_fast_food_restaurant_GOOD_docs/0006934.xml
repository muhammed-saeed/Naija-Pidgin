 that you just have to bite the bullet and be invested and go with it, I 
 feel very strongly about that. Various liquidity is going to be coming 
 from all corners of the world. At no time has gold pulled back 
 throughout any of this credit tightening process, the market is going 
 higher. We are in my opinion going to see a $2,000 handle this year.
