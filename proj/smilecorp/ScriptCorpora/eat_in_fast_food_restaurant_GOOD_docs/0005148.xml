 Ohio State Study: Providing Nutrition Information at Restaurants Helps Consumers Cut Calories

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- An Ohio State University study provides more evidence 
that consumers pay attention to calorie counts of meals when they are 
provided conveniently.

The study collected data about choices consumers made among 12 entrees 
offered at a university dining center that operates much like a 
fast-food restaurant. Researchers found that when nutrition information 
was provided at the point-of-purchase, sales of high-calorie entrees 
dramatically decreased, while sales of lower-calorie items substantially
 increased. After the nutrition information was removed, sales of the 
higher-calorie items gradually increased again.

The study offers strong evidence for requiring restaurants to provide 
nutrition information in a manner that doesn&apos;t require consumers to ask 
for it or look for it, said Gail Kaye, one of the study&apos;s authors. 
Significantly, the restaurant lost nothing in sales during the study, 
Kaye said. The revenue per entree sold remained consistent before, 
during and after the nutrition information was offered. This finding 
could help reduce qualms of restaurants hesitant to offer calorie 
information to consumers for fear that sales would decrease, but Kaye, a
 program director with Ohio State University Extension and the 
Department of Human Nutrition in the College of Education and Human 
Ecology, is even more interested in the calorie savings for consumers.

&quot;The average decrease in calories in the entrees chosen was small, about
 12 calories on the first day and increasing gradually through the 
two-week study period, but the decrease was immediate when nutrition 
information was available,&quot; Kaye said. &quot;Even more dramatic was the 
difference in the numbers of higher- and lower-calorie entrees sold 
before calorie counts were available.&quot; Of the 12 entrees tracked, the 
six highest-calorie entrees all decreased in sales between the two weeks
 before nutrition information was available and the two weeks during the
 study when it was available. The highest-calorie entree (839 calories) 
lost the most sales -- a decrease of 190, or 5.4 percent; an entree 
offering 735 calories lost the most ground percentage-wise, decreasing 
by 80 sales, or by 25 percent. All of the six lower-calories entrees 
increased in sales, with a mid-range offering containing 492 calories 
increasing in number by 289, or 8.2 percent. The lowest-calorie entree, 
with 412 calories, increased in sales by 108, or by 50 percent.

To conduct the study, researchers initially collected sales data on the 
12 entrees for two weeks. The only information offered to consumers was a
 description of each entree. During the next two weeks, posters with 
simplified nutrition labels for each of the 12 entrees were posted at 
the point of selection; information included total calories, serving 
size, and amount of fat, protein and carbohydrates in each entree. In 
addition, a space divider guided patrons in a manner so they could view 
the information and menu board easily. After a 14-day period, the 
nutrition information was removed and descriptions of the entrees were 
again offered, this time on a sheet of paper in a floor stand, as was 
typical practice at the restaurant before the study began. The 
restaurant made no modifications to the recipes during the study, but 
afterwards, it reformulated its highest-calorie offering to reduce the 
calorie content by 172 calories, to 667 calories. The change is 
substantial, the researchers said: An extra 172 calories a day can cause
 an increase of 11 pounds of body weight over the course of an academic 
year.

Interest in the effect of posting calorie information on restaurant 
menus and menu boards increased in 2008 when the New York City Board of 
Health began requiring the information, at least for chain restaurants. 
Currently, the federal government is considering enacting similar 
legislation nationwide. New regulations could make a significant 
difference in the nation&apos;s obesity rate, Kaye said. In 2007, Americans 
spent $555.7 billion on meals prepared away from home, compared with 
$331.8 billion in 1997.

The study, &quot;Improving Patrons&apos; Meal Selections Through the Use of 
Point-of-Selection Nutrition Labels,&quot; was published in the November 2009
 issue of the American Journal of Public Health . Lead author was 
Yong H. Chu, who was Kaye&apos;s undergraduate student at Ohio State during 
the time of the study; he is now with the University of South Carolina, 
Columbia, as are co-authors Edward A. Frongillo and Sonya J. Jones.
