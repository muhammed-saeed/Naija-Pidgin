 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Another Golden Idea, Don.

I just called pharmacyautomationsupplies.com and spoke with them - minimum order of 12,000 - on the smallest bags, looking at $321 + shipping. Looking at the larger sizes, you could probably get everything - printed, shipped, even on the larger bags, for $500.

On the smallest bags (3.5X1.5X10) how many ads do you get on there?

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 I think on my next day off, I may to go to a small town of 2500-3000 and see if I can get the pharmacy to agree to me providing the bags for them. Then, I&apos;ll go and sell 4 different businesses at $375 each - for 10,000. I think most pharmacies use the small bags - enough for 4, maybe 6 ads on them.

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 This seems so brain dead simple...

Thanks for a terrific idea.

Question: Don, do you believe this tactic to be more valuable away from a large metro area? Of would there be no difference?

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 I personally spoke to 3 pharmacies today....

I am to call the 1st pharmacy when the partner returns tomorrow.
I am to call the 2nd pharmacy on Friday when she&apos;s not so busy...she could hardly believe I was
offering a FREE service. 
The owner of 3rd pharmacy will be in on Weds.

Yikes!! Now I&apos;ll need samples. Any ideas as to what I should include??

Give it a whirl guys! No one bit me....at least not yet!! Reply With Quote 11-15-2010  02:10 PM #6 KGBiz

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 I just moved to the town I&apos;m in now, but I&apos;ll bet there are a few pharmacies in the area that wouldn&apos;t mind cutting their expenses. It simply amazes me how ingenious these ideas are. Sometimes, the opportunities sit right under your nose and you never even know it! Reply With Quote 11-15-2010  05:26 PM #7 caryduke

 I think I will be dropping into a few Tuesday as well. Any chance you can scan in a copy of the bags containing ads? It would be appreciated. Reply With Quote 11-15-2010  05:50 PM #8 MrPhelps

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 The key phrase there is&quot;independent pharmacies&quot;. Forget Walgreens, CostCo, Walmart, CVS, and all the other&quot;major&quot;players. Unless someone knows how to work with them. Check out the OGO on my latest software to help local offliners: Local Domain Hound

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Found this:

Demographics

An average pharmacy fills 500 prescriptions each week
The average per-person pharmacy transaction is $51.68
74% of pharmacy customers are 50+ years of age
The average customer has an annual income of $59,000, owns a home and has 2.6 children
Adults age 50+ account for:

60% of all healthcare expenditures
are the most affluent of any age group
have over $1.9 trillion in spending power and a net worth almost twice the national average
have a per capita income that is 26% higher than the national average
The 50+ age group is larger than both the African-American and Hispanic markets combined Reply With Quote 11-15-2010  06:46 PM #10 caryduke

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 And this in Black Hat World tarting a new bag on Monday for Fishers, Indiana. This would be a year&apos;s worth of advertising. Fishers is a suburb of Indianapolis.

&quot;Again, It would be a year&apos;s worth of advertising. The small ads go for $399, for the 24,000 bags...so that works out to a years worth of advertising for 1.7 cents per bag.

Since this is a year&apos;s worth of advertising on this bag, the spots usually go fast...&quot; Reply With Quote 11-15-2010  08:35 PM #11 rolltide

I discovered 2 paid $395 to be on back and 1 paid $595 to be on front of 12,ooo bags.

I found a bag supplier who charges 2cents per bag for 12,000 = $240 for 12,000.

So.....I took the bags I picked up and went to 2 Independent Pharmacies and asked owners if I could provide them with FREE bags.

BOTH agreed. So...guess what I&apos;ll be doing the next couple of days.

Don Alm....&quot;Sales Guy&quot; So, there&apos;s the cost of the bags but what about the cost for printing 12,000 bags? Anyone has a good, affordable printer that can handle printing on bags and not just on flyers? Thanks in advance, Eva Reply With Quote 11-16-2010  06:07 PM #13 BigTom

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 http://www.pharmacyautomationsupplie....asp?dept=1007 

If you go with these guys they will require a minimum order of 24K bags. There is $120 art department fee (consulting with graphics guy)
and $60 template/logo design fee (using 2 colors) for printing. There&apos;s also UPS shipping fee.

Using them to print 24K advertising bags that are 5X2&quot;X10&quot;will cost me about $900. I am inclined to believe there has to be a place
with better prices.

I believe there is a minimum order of 18K on the plain white bags.

I was told their prices are going up 7% December 1st. I spoke to a guy by the name of Alex.

I suppose there&apos;s no harm in asking the owner what vendor is currently printing his/her bags. Perhaps they are already
getting a break with pricing. If so, use them.... Last edited by BigTom; 11-16-2010 at 06:15 PM . Reply With Quote 11-16-2010  06:14 PM #14 caryduke

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Ok.

I went into 4 pharmacies today. 3 were plain stock bags, the other was sponsored by&quot;pharmacy group&quot;. I found the supplier of two of the stores which gives me the exact cost the store is out of pocket for the bags. Approx $350 for 12k bags.

My cost for these bags printed in two colors is exactly the same (its the same supplier they are currently using, so I can guaranty the quality). I have the cost with shipping down to $.286 per bag. I will try to squeeze two ads on the front and four on the back to net $2000.

Like Don said above, there were no questions and each person I spoke with was very interested in the idea of receiving free bags. I&apos;m doing the mock up tonight.

Will show at least 2 of the owners the mock-up Wednesday.

In addition to the list Don gave as possible buyers, I would also add elder care attorneys, and long term care/health insurance agents Reply With Quote 11-16-2010  07:12 PM #15 BrianNC

I would add regular insurance agents, health insurance, rehab facilities.

Gar-Smith is the least costly option I&apos;ve found to date. Monday, I will be contacting Cardinal Bag.

The printing Medi-Bag uses is sharper and more vibrant than what Gar-Smith does. I&apos;d like to find out who they use.

I have two pharmacies signed-up and need to sell the ad space this week. 8-) Reply With Quote 11-28-2010  09:24 AM #21 BrianNC

I don&apos;t have the numbers in front of me but I recall thinking that the group you mentioned was more than double the cost. Almost $900 for the 24k bags. Those color artwork charges plus double the shipping cost. I do not want 24k bags as it makes it about a years worth of bags for the pharmacies I am working with. And, no opportunity to resell the ads inside of a year... Reply With Quote 11-28-2010  02:48 PM #25 sikeoseller

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Here&apos;s what I&apos;m doing with this. I&apos;m getting the pharmacy to participate by placing ads for the advertisers on the local business directory website I have. So your probably asking what difference would it make to the pharmacy other than free bags? Well I give a free ad to the pharmacy on the directory site as well in addition to the free bags.

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Hi All,

I have been in advertising/ marketing sales for more then 20 years. This method was used 25 plus years ago and I can tell you that although it sounds like a great idea it really has (in most cases) dismal results with a very low renewal rate. It is similar to tray liner advertising where you offer to print free tray liners for a fast food restaurant. The fast food restaurant would usually be a franchise (not corporate) owned and has a local decision maker. Since this is a big expense the restaurant will usually say yes to the free liners. The problem with these (including bags) is the response rate. I have had many unhappy clients that have done these types of ads.

There are ad companies that have contracts with major pharmacy retailers like Kroger Grocery stores and they hire reps and pay them 100% commission to sell ads on these bags. The mentality of most of these reps that stick around are to sell the space on the bag and get out of dodge! They move on to the next area and sell more ad space never going back to the clients that they sold prior to this. Why?

Ask yourself these questions. How frequently do you read your tray liners and your pharmacy bags? If it works so well after 25 years why are there not more ads on pharmacy bags at places like Kroger? BTW...The advertiser does have the company&apos;s contact info and if they really wanted to renew they could renew by phone.

I am not trying to bash the idea. I just know in my heart (without any shadow of doubt) that it is not an advertising medium that is capable of standing on it&apos;s own merit. I would never put my good name behind a technique like this by itself. Perhaps it can be added as an extra value builder to some of the more effective advertising techniques.

In my experience of dealing with local businesses this is old school advertising and they are pretty sick of this old school stuff in general. That is the appeal of introducing online strategies to these businesses. It is fresh and new and has not been over-saturated yet.

Best of Success to All of You,
Rick Reply With Quote 12-12-2010  09:25 AM #33 DavidCarrington

 Re:&quot;Pharmacy Bags&quot;
 Personally, the reason I think things like this work&quot;supposedly&quot;so well for Don is because he mainly&quot;works&quot;small towns in the Pacific northwest where things lag behind a bit. That&apos;s not meant to be criticism, it&apos;s just a fact. It&apos;s just like what is fashionable now in New York City has not become fashionable in rural America yet. Things usually tend to change slowly.

On the smallest bags (3.5X1.5X10) how many ads do you get on there?

Jeremy 

idea is not bad at all, especially if you can cut costs in start, buying as low priced prescription bags at is it possible. for example I was trading with pharmacy bags (from this Europe company) at $0,013 per bag (for 100.000+ bag orders), for 2 years in France, combined advertising bags AND/OR trading with generic bags with 2,5x price, and some more options, depending on customers.
I think that point is to be flexible and to found out what local market wants. I am telling this because my idea was just to do standard free + advertising bags business, but found that in smaller local markets,&quot;taste&quot;can vary, so someone will accept free bags with ads, on the other hand advertisers will accept and pay, but some others will be rater interested to have cute bag, and if you can make good profit why not to step out from previous plan I hope that I helped someone with my experience.
