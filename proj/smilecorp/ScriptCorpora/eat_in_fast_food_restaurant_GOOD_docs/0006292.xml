De Koperen Hoogte: De Koperen Hoogte part I
 a5floor   1298 reviews 4 more images 
For my birthday I got a certificate for the restaurant De Koperen Hoogte. On 2 October 2010 we (me, my parents, my sister&amp;her boyfriend) went to this restaurant.

This restaurant/hotel is in what used to be a water tower. There are 2 restaurants at this water tower. One down at the ground level and the other one up in the air at the top (where the water basin is). We went in the elevator to the top. The elevator is on the outside of the water tower. This way you will have a great view from the area (on the day we went it was rainy/foggy, so we couldn&apos;t look far). Once in the restaurant you will sit down next to the windows. From here you will have a great view over the area as well. The best part of it, is that the sitting part is moving around 360 degrees. We have been there for about 3.5 hours and we have been round during our stay. Be aware that your bags are under your seat cause the window is not going around as well.

My parents, sister&amp;her boyfriend had the surprise menu. This menu allows the chefs to make meals what they come up with that day. You can have a 3, 4 or 5 cours from this menu. I had the vegetarion main cours and dessert. Which was yummie as well. :)

Be aware that you have make reservations before you can go to this restaurant.

Chinees Cantonees Restaurant Taiwan: Chinese please
 egonwegh   1136 reviews 
Chinese restaurant, nicely decorated, in the historic town centre of Zwolle, we had dinner here on 18 May 2008.

 Favorite Dish: We had &apos;Indische rijsttafel&apos; - Indonesian rice dish - for two persons, a soft drink and some white beer, and paid 42.50 euro. I can recommend the restaurant, the food tasted great!

This restaurant also offers: lunch, take away, and catering.

Restaurant de 4 Azen: Four Aces
 egonwegh   1136 reviews 
Jennie and I visited this restaurant with friends of ours on 7 September 2008. Part of a chain of restaurants, you&apos;ll also find a 4 Azen (Four Aces) Restaurant in &apos;s-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven - provided you know where to look for them, of course. The Zwolle restaurant is to be found on the Melkmarkt in the town centre, in what looked like the former town house of a rich merchant. Hardly any decorations on the wall and no fancy furniture, but plain wooden tables instead. We enjoyed our dinner very much!

 Favorite Dish: We all had a three course menu, mine was excellent, I had carpaccio, hoenfilet (chicken), and parfait for dessert, for which I paid 28,50 Euro. The standard price for the three course menu is 24, 50 Euro (2008), but some dishes on the menu come with a small extra charge. Note that they also charge a couple of euros extra for french fries and salad. Recommended!

Urbana: Almost suburban
 egonwegh   1136 reviews 
Restaurant and conference centre. This is where we held the reception after our wedding in Zwolle, back in 1994. We visited this place again in the course of one of our &apos;nostalgic&apos; trips, in March 2007.

 Favorite Dish: We had some white beer and bitter lemon with eight &apos;bitterballen&apos; (my dictionary says I should describe these as &apos;small croquettes&apos;).

Cafeteria Pitstop: Pitstop
 egonwegh   1136 reviews 
[We drove past this restaurant again in November 2006, but apparently the restaurant has closed and the building itself is up for sale ]- Fast food restaurant, we ordered some French fries here just before they closed down for the day at 8 pm. Fast service, the kind you&apos;d expect at a pitstop, we were served in under three minutes! To be found in the borough of Westenholte north-west of Zwolle along the road to &apos;s-Heerenbroek.

De Vierjaargetijden: The best place for good and pretty cheap food!
 crazydingo   9 reviews 
De vierjaargetijden is a very nice bar/restaurant... Its the place to be! Many local people are visiting the place. If your not having dinner its a nice stay too. But ofcourse you can eat very well. The food is very good for a low price. There&apos;s some for anyone on the menu. I always go there for the sate. In the summer its nice sitting on the terras. Its in the middle of town so you can sit and relax watching people passing by.

 Favorite Dish: My favorite dish is ofcourse the sate...its called vier balineesjes op een stokje...translated four balinese on a stick...sounds pervert, tastes great! The mixed grill is good too! Just give it a try!

Het Vliegende Paard (The Flying Horse): Cheap and fancy food!
 ramons   1 reviews 
The Flying Horse is the local and official student pub in Zwolle, where students can get very very cheap meals from 5-9pm. Everyday there is a different menu with a selection of at least 10 different dishes, varying from pasta, chinese, vegetarian, healthy and unhealthy (remember the students).
Non-students are welcome too, so if you are a tourist, just talk your way in and say you read about this great place on the Internet. They&apos;ll love you for that!

Restaurant Poppe: Dining in an old smithy
 ATLC   3772 reviews 
Old smithy in Zwolle, with that warm, authentic atmosphere. Kitchen in the middle of the restaurant which is always nice entertainment to watch.

I came here first about 18 years ago and have returned a few times since, when I was in the neighbourhood.
That proves I like it!

The building housed the city judge and executioner in the 17th and 18th century. Then in 1797 it was sold to a family of horsesmiths, called Poppe. It remained a smithy until 1973, and was then sold and turned into a restaurant.
