 I. RATIONALE for the Use of Performance in the Classroom

Creative dramatics of all sorts are essential, especially in the 1990&apos;s when
our emphasis is no longer solely upon distributing &quot;book&quot; knowledge. Here
are a few major reasons supporting periodic use of performance in the English
(or other) classroom:
 It seems overwhelmingly accepted that there are many ways to &quot;know&quot; a subject,
 one of which being kinesthetically through drama. Performance can heighten
 a student&apos;s understanding of a text or idea by forcing her to look at it
 in a new and different way. Students assume ownership of their own learning in drama, for they become
 responsible for interpretation and creation of a new representation of the
 text. If we consider it vital for students to make meaning of literature
 then creative dramatics offers an excellent means to that end. Dramatic techniques are based upon &quot;active&quot; learning. Students must pull
 meaning &quot;off the page&quot; by entering and working through texts, looking both
 through the original writer&apos;s eyes as well as their own. A performed text
 is no longer a dead, black-and-white series of words. In order to represent
 a text through performance a student needs to go through a process of
 comprehending it, interpreting it, and &quot;rewriting&quot; it. If our jobs as English teachers is to aid students&apos; communication skills
 we need to remember communication is much more than just reading and writing.
 Utilizing, interpreting, and critiquing physical expression and oral
 communication are very much in the realm of our objectives. In today&apos;s culture,
 movies, TV, and images of all sorts bombard us; it is essential students
 are able to read them critically. Drama promotes this critical eye. Representing ideas orally helps students become better speakers and language
 users. Through speech performance they learn about formal presentation structures
 and procedures and how to more effectively communicate their ideas. Dramatic techniques emphasize group work, and thus promote collaboration
 and teamworkessential life skills for the 21st century. A classroom
 which utilizes cooperative performance as a basis for learning and interpreting
 literature is by necessity a community. On the practical side, if approached sensitively most students enjoy setting
 aside the books and desks to perform. Further, students will be engaged both
 as actors and viewers because they are motivated by the excitement this generates
 in the classroom. Assessing through drama also reduces teacher paper load immensely!


Movement to sound, pantomime, charades, enactments, and improvisations...are
not just games for kiddies, or `enrichment,&apos; but serious business. Teachers
should not feel that the time spent on them is diverted from the tasks of
learning about language, literature, and composition. Drama will definitely
further such goals. Furthermore, adolescents are by no means ready just to
sit and work with books and paper all day, every day... Many teachers are
afraid that drama work will open a vent and create disorder, but all people
who have worked with it know that it tends, rather, to lower tensions and
to help students behave better.
James Moffett

Drama helps children journey inside the story garden, so that they can
reconstruct the symbols, images, and narrative suspense `in action,&apos; thus
re-examining the story&apos;s ideas, experimenting with them, learning to `play&apos;
with the narrative, and in reflection, coming to an understanding of both
the story&apos;s possibilities and the art form used to create it. In drama, the
mutual, symbolic collaboration of ideas and undetermined plot allows children
to pause in a fictional present, linger on an image, or move forward, backward,
and sideways, in an attempt to make meaning happen.
David Booth

Because sign shifting has become one of the required habits of mind for
postmodern life,...English studies and the English language arts, K-12, should
include translations from one sign system to another as an essential part
of the curriculum. These translations...should include translating words
into action&quot;acting out&quot; scenes from stories, poems, and dramasand
translating novels to films, reports to speeches, painting to descriptions,
descriptions to maps, maps to models, ideas to talk-show panels...Miles
Myers
 

 II. DEFINITIONS: &quot;Dramatics&quot; vs. &quot;Theater&quot;

While the shared performance aspect of most dramatic endeavors causes them
to be very similar, there are differences essential to our use of them in
the English classroom. The nutshell distinction is that &quot;drama,&quot; &quot;creative
dramatics,&quot; &quot;role-plays&quot; and the like are based upon experience: what happens
within each individual before, during, and after their performance. &quot;Theater&quot;
and &quot;formal drama,&quot; on the other hand, center around precise design and a
polished product.

 Theater / Formal Drama Creative Dramatics / Informal Drama Primarily for an audience, with emphasis upon end product; external appearances
 are #1 Primarily for participant, emphasizing exploration and growth by participants;
 internal processes are #1 Distinguishes between performer and audience, with the latter acting as viewers
 only Limited distinction between participant and audience because roles reverse
 and converge Involves recitation of set, pre-written materialusually by an author
 who is not a participant Often involves spontaneous material and responses; if using scripts, usually
 written or adapted by participants Participants interpret words and actions of their characters using techniques
 and forms of stage action and direction Participants are usually self-expressive, communicating their own ideas and
 directing their own performance Normally occurs in a formal theater environment Takes place in any open space 

 Note , according to these terms, &quot;creative dramatics&quot; includes everything
from performing student-adapted scripts to presenting a poem as a class,
to delivering impromptu speeches. Always remember, depending upon the context,
as we work to create dramatic opportunities in the classroom we should not
be overly concerned with the end piece or sophistication of acting or directing,
but instead with what students are experiencing and how they understand,
interpret, and represent literature. A chaotic, improvised scene could in
fact involve a great amount of learning!
 

 III. STRUCTURING for Success!

With most of us not being trained actors or directors, it is self-evident
why a teacher would have reservations about attempting dramatic techniques.
How do you get them motivated? What if they refuse, oreven worseuse
it as an excuse to goof off? Given these very realistic concerns it is easier
for a teacher to keep students in their seats, even if they truly wish to
get them up and moving or involved. Below are a few suggestions on how to
create an environment which fosters a productive and motivated atmosphere
for performance. Note how each implies a &quot;learning community&quot; classroom
structure; mutual respect and trust must be a prime goal in order for drama
to work in the classroom.
 Never jump into performance &quot;cold&quot;. Even low pressure tasks such as reading
 parts to a play involve exposure and risk and can be threatening to many
 students. Approach dramatics thoughtfully, with care and preparation. This
 works on two levels:
 First, if a class traditionally does mainly seat work, just one day saying
 &quot;Okay kids, today you will get up in front of the class and act&quot; out of the
 blue is a recipe for disaster. Precedents for this sort of activity must
 be set, inhibitions addressed, and a community formed. Start small, with
 warm-ups (see below) and simple activities before delving in full-force. Secondly, even if you do habitually use drama, don&apos;t expect students to just
 get up and do it on your moments notice! Make sure to have them warmed up
 (see below).
 Keep your classes in mind. Most creative activities will work for most classes,
 but as you well know factors such as student ages, class size, degrees of
 interest in the material, and overall classroom dynamics change from hour
 to hour, requiring changes anywhere from presentation to the entire structure
 of lesson activities. For example, one class may be able to achieve from
 a quick &quot;somehow perform this poem without using words&quot;, whereas others will
 need to be guided through brainstorming, examples, and even their very
 performance. Keep planning and performance times shorter rather than longer. If things
 drag, &quot;dead time&quot; can kill enthusiasm for your project! Although there is nothing wrong with requiring memorization of lines from
 a script, poem, etc., since end product is not the focus here it should not
 always be required. In fact, improvisation often yields more in this context!
 On the other hand, also remember that if you allow scripts to be read, a
 &quot;reading&quot; may be all you will get: a dull and lifeless recitation of words
 enlightening and interesting no one. Although there are no positive answers
 here, just ask yourself what would be best for each particular situation. Your place as leader and guide of dramatic activities is ever-shifting. Some
 classes may require you to be a direct participant in the activities, whereas
 in others you may better help student learning as a consultant and monitor.
 In general, try to keep the power for decisions and performance in the hands
 of the students, all the while nudging them ever further into the material.
 Playing it safe does not promote the best learning and enjoyment, so encourage
 them to take risks! Remind students you are not assessing the quality of
 the end product, but the process of their efforts. Dramatics should more often than not lead to discussion. Although simply
 preparing and enacting performances is valuable for student learning, reflection
 by the individual and class furthers their understanding of the literature
 immensely. As a leader, question performers afterwards on why they chose
 to do things that particular way, and have the audience share their own
 impressions and interpretations of it. As with any other activity, if used too often performance can become boring
 to students and lose its effectivenessespecially if the same sorts
 of ideas are used over and over again. Don&apos;t overuse it!

 

 IV. OBJECTIVES AND ASSESSMENT

Although raising communication, cooperation, and public speaking skills are
among the very worthwhile purposes in using drama in the classroom, it is
also very effective for teaching literature. Consider replacing a worksheet
or simple chapter review with a performance of some sort. Possibly even use
it for a unit&apos;s final assessment!
As you design these activities, make sure to keep in mind what exactly you
would like students to walk away withjust as you would with any other
type of lesson, from bookwork to discussions. Although many of the goals
in performance-based activities may not be objective or quantitative, they
may still be used as a form of assessment; dramatics are no more subjective
than the creative writing or standard essays we currently grade every day.
And as with these you should write simple rubrics for each performance based
upon the goals for the assignment.
Here is a sample criteria items designed for a newscast assignment based
upon 1984 (Diana Mitchell, English Journal , Jan. 1997, pg. 99). Each
item matches requirements given to the students for their presentations. 
 Respond to the following by selecting 1) not at all; 2) a little; 3) somewhat;
 4) a great deal. 
1. The details of the arrest were clear
2. All arrested parties had biographies given with all pertinent information
 included
3. Interviews kept Julia, Big Brother, and Winston&apos;s characters consistent,
 as in the novel
4. New insights into the characters were shown through the way they were
 prepared.
5. The creative elements enhanced this presentation

Practically none of the above is entirely our own creation. Although framed
by us in accordance with our own classroom experiences, we referred to many
outside texts, both written and otherwise. Major contributors were works

 S IMPLE WARM-UP ACTIVITIES:

Choose two or three each time you do dramatic activities

 Stretching: Have students stand and move far enough away from
 one another that they can extend their arms and legs. Breathe deeply a few
 times (&quot;focus breaths&quot;), then raise arms over head, out to sides, then bend
 and touch to floor. Twist torsos, rotate heads (gently!!), and finally shake
 arms about. Relaxation Exercises: Students stretch and relax their bodies.
 Many yoga postures depict animals or objects in nature, such as a lion, lotus,
 or bridge. Students can use relaxation techniques to play act and imitate. Farmyard: Though silly and childish, a good way to have students
 lower their guard and loosen up. Stand so everyone can see one another, then
 lead them through pretending they are farm animals: cluck like a chicken
 for a minute, snort and snuffle like a pig, etc. Keep each imitation quick,
 and encourage body movements too. Orchestra: &quot;Conduct&quot; students through making noises of their
 choice (brrrrrrrrr; click-click-click; etc.). They should respond by making
 the noise as directed, as well as making it as loud. Mirrors: In pairs, students watch one another and mimic without
 words or extraneous facial expressions. After about a minute, reverse roles.
 You may also stand before the class and have everyone mirror you! Statues&amp;/or Mime: In statues, three students pose for
 a scene. You may give them a scenario (two of you are mad at the third; one
 is in love with another, the third is jealous; etc.) or they can create one
 and have the class guess its meaning. Mime is similar, although with motion
 and no words. Students could imitate common actions: combing hair, talking
 on the phone, trying to keep from falling asleep at a lecture. Students could
 also mime objects and animals: an airplane coming in for a landing, a bumble
 bee buzzing from flower to flower, leaves falling off a tree in Autumn. Students
 could also mime emotions: joy, sadness, anger, or a mixture of various moods Freeze Tag: Extremely crazy but great for warm-ups if you have
 the room (i.e., gym or outdoors). Have one student be &quot;it&quot;. If tagged, students
 must freeze in place until someone else tags them or everyone is frozen. Machine: Each student does a single, repetitious movement
 associated with the working of some machine, and gives it a sound. Then,
 one after one, students align themselves to become a single, larger machine.
 What it does could be up for discussion as well! Intonation: Good for warming up vocal cords and priming the
 ear for storytelling or choral readings. Students repeat words after the
 teacher in many different tones: high pitched&amp;low, soft, loud, happy,
 etc. Rhythm and Movement: A leader beats out movement by pounding
 on desk or make-shift drum. Students respond to the beat, slow and fast.
 Students could move around in the timing or move arms or other body parts
 only. Students might also respond to music this way. Drama Circle: Students get in a circle and are called upon
 individually by teacher to imitate objects. One student starts as maybe an
 automobile and drives toward another students in the circle. Then that student
 becomes another, totally different object and moves toward a third student
 in the circle. No repetitions and teacher can help with calling out objects
 (plane, leaf, tornado), animals, or persons (man with limp leg, cold person,
 baby just learning to walk). Object Animation: Students get in circle and pass around an
 ordinary object (stapler, pencil, etc.), transforming it into something other
 than what it is. A stapler can become a comb, toothbrush, razor, gun, butterfly,
 etc. Items should not be repeat

 
 

 PER FORMANCE PROJECT IDEAS FOR LITERATURE

(adapted&amp;compiled from various sources)
The following are abstracts of exercises useful in constructing creative
drama lessons on poetry, fiction, non-fiction, scripts, etc.

 Stimulus Cards: Prior to a new unit on a story, novel, or play,
 students are given a set of cards with incidents, characters, settings. moods,
 etc. and told to work them into some sort of scene which they will either
 perform or tell as a story. Students then compare their stories with how
 the author under study did. Example: &quot;A secret wedding&quot;, &quot;A hot-headed youth&quot;,
 etc. for Romeo&amp;Juliet. Making A Picture: Students arrange their groups to illustrate
 a theme of a scene or chapter, a character&apos;s emotion, poem&apos;s mood, or even
 a vocabulary word&apos;s meaning, and then they freeze for the class to observe
 or guess. Choral Reading: Much the same as modern poetry (or &quot;slams&quot;),
 through tone of voice and volume students emphasize the meaning of a work.
 They divide the work into sections to be read together and apart, fast, slow,
 etc. all in support of their interpretation of the literature. Performance Poetry: Students in groups or as whole class read,
 discuss, and interpret a poem or selection of poems to provide an oral
 interpretation. Students would, through movement, voice, and creation of
 pictures, attempt to represent the work&apos;s meaning, voice, mood, and style
 in a physical way. Reader&apos;s Theater: Similar to choral readings except students
 write shortened scripts from a novel or story. Positioning in the room is
 also a must consideration: stand apart, together, etc. for stereo effects. Chamber Theater: A step further than reader&apos;s theater, here
 students enhance their vocal performances with motion and pantomime. They
 may also step outside the actual scripts to soliloquize on the action or
 talk with the audience about what they, as characters, are thinking and/or
 feeling. Improvisational Theater: Students start with a set
 textdrama, poetry, short storyand after having read, discussed,
 and understood literary aspects of the work, they act it out, creating their
 own lines and actions as they go. Story Theater: Students pantomime the events and characters
 of a story. This can be done as teacher reads it aloud or as a silent condensed
 version. For example Romeo and Juliet can be made into a ten-minute silent
 play. Illustrated Theater: Students combine mime and improvisational
 scripting to tell a story. Students use their bodies to become the objects
 of their story: a counter at a store, a clock, a door, trees, an elevator,
 etc. Scenes should be simple: person going to work or school, visiting a
 dentist office, or riding a bicycle through central park. Illustrated theater
 could also be used to have students explain a literary concept, present a
 scene or an idea from their reading, or to teach a process of doing something. Whole Class Drama: Entire class is engaged in the making of
 a play or scene. Students visualize themselves in a familiar place: school
 playground, dog show, shopping mall, fast food restaurant, football game,
 etc., and act out according to the roles they are assigned. For example,
 the scene might be a protest rally against abortion clinics. Students role-play
 predetermined characters: Joe, the irate anti-abortion protester; John, the
 consoling priest; Stephanie, the woman trying to get into the clinic; Alice,
 the first police officer on the scene; Matt, the head doctor at the clinic.
 This activity could be used in conjunction with reading and learning about
 the abortion debate. Puppetry: Students use puppets in a variety ways to mask
 nervousness and shyness with performance. Puppets allows for heightened dramatic
 work while it takes focus off the person, for all eyes are on the puppet.
 Students could use this to introduce themselves at the start of year, read
 a poem the puppet chose, engage in a dialogue with characters in the reading,
 be characters in scenes they write. Puppets could be as simple as a sock
 or painted hand.


 NOTE: Although most of these ideas are presented
with the assumption they will be performed &quot;live&quot; for the class, don&apos;t forget
the power and usefulness of video and sound recording. For example, a role-play
radio newscast, or compilation of poetry read by the class.
