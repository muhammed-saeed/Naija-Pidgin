 Slice It Up! Tropical Fruit Galette 

 9 May 
 

There’s nothing like waiting until the last minute. Technically, there’s nothing like waiting until the day before the last minute, which is what I’ve done with my contribution to the OXO Slice It Up recipe contest. I saw the contest advertised on Pinterest a while back, and though I had every intention to enter because I find these things fun, I could not for the life of me think up what to bake.

I am lucky enough to own an OXO mandoline , and using it to slice up lovely fruit to create a lovely galette was one of the first ideas that crossed my mind when it came into my possession. But what fruit?

 

The tropical fruit galette is actually the third galette I made. I deemed my first two attempts not worthy enough, but in hindsight I think I did that simply to keep making galettes. Those first galettes involved layers of Granny Smith apples sandwiched between black cherry preserves and  brie cheese. And though they tasted great, I wanted something with a little more color.

 

I finally decided on a tropical fruit galette simply because mangoes were available at the store for 99 cents. Tropical fruits pair well together, so I picked up a fresh pineapple, a kiwi, and got to slicing. I ended up with a tropical fruit galette topped with a light layer of caramel sauce and a sprinkle of toasted coconut.

 

I used to think galettes were complex creations, but I now see galettes as the perfect dish to bake when the desire to serve a homemade dessert runs into the constraints of time and ingredients. I prepared this galette in about 45 minutes, and I always have the main components–flour, butter, sugar, and fruit–on hand to whip up a simple crust and flavorful filling. Try one–like me, you might be surprised that something so simple to prepare can taste so delightful. Enjoy!

 

 
 
 Tropical Fruit Galette Print 
 Recipe type: Dessert Author: Love&amp;Flour Ingredients 
 For the dough: 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup butter, cut into small pieces 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2-3 tablespoons water For the filling: 1 mango 1/4 fresh pineapple 1 kiwi 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ginger 1 teaspoon vanilla, divided 1 tablespoon coconut, toasted For the caramel sauce: 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons water 
 Instructions 
 Place the all-purpose flour, butter, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and process until crumbly. Add two tablespoons of water and continue to process just until the dough comes together. If necessary, slowly add the third tablespoon of water to bind the dough. Form the dough into a ball and place into the refrigerator 5-10 minutes. While the dough chills, peel and slice the fruit. (Please be careful when peeling and slicing the fruit; peeled mangoes and pineapples are very slick!) Whisk together the sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Place half of the sugar and spice mixture in a medium bowl with the mango, and place the other half in a second medium bowl with the pineapple. Pour 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla over the fruit in each bowl and toss to coat. Do not toss the kiwi in the sugar and spice mixture–it’s simply too delicate. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Top with a second sheet and the dough out to about 1/4 inch thickness. Try to keep the dough in a rough circle for a round galette or a rectangle for, you guessed it, a rectangular galette. Layer the mango slices along the rolled out dough, leaving about a 1 to 2 inch border. Layer the pineapple slices on top of the mango slices, then layer the kiwi in the center on top of the pineapple. Fold the sides of the galette up onto the pineapple. The dough is very soft, so take care not to rip the edges at the fold. The dough is also very forgiving and should fold naturally as you lift it from the parchment onto the fruit. Brush the turned edges with water and sprinkle sugar onto the wet dough. Bake the galette at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes until the edges of the dough are golden brown. While the galette bakes, make the caramel sauce by heating the sugar and water over low heat. When the sugar browns, stir in the butter until melted, then remove from heat. Brush the caramel sauce over the top of the fruit once the galette is removed from the oven. Sprinkle toasted coconut across the top. Serve warm. 
 Notes 
No food processor? To make the dough, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter.

To toast coconut, place an even layer of coconut on a baking sheet, then bake in a 350 degree F oven for 4-7 minutes. Keep a close eye on the coconut while it toasts to ensure it does not burn.

 Sweet Cinnamon Bun Pie for a Sweet Lady 

 8 Mar 
 

I struggled with knowing what to write for this post for weeks. You see, today is my grandmother’s birthday, but what could I bake to honor someone who has cooked thousands upon thousands of meals for a large family?

When I turned to my recipe box for inspiration and found it littered with index cards that include“like Gma M”in the title. I have Potatoes – Like Gma M, Hot Fudge Sauce – Like Gma M, Chocolate Chip Cookies – Like Gma M, and on and on.  My uncle and I agree she makes the best pecan pie in the world (or at least in Ohio), and at Christmas the most popular gifts are bags of her caramel popcorn.

After much thought, I decided on a coffee-flavored dessert. I probably had my first cup of coffee with Grandma. When I was quite young, she used to pour me a mug to drink with her . I think she got a kick out of me liking coffee. And I really did like it–it wasn’t something I drank to pretend I was a grown up.

 

To this day, I take my coffee with a lot of cream, just like Grandma. The coffee in her mug is always a light tan, rather than deep brown, from all the cream. Though I heeded my Grandpa’s warning that eating bread crusts would put hair on my chest, I took a chance that Grandma warning coffee would stunt my growth was false. At 5′7″, my growth seems to have been relatively unaffected.

So coffee it was. But the thought of cinnamon buns kept tugging at the back of my mind because my mom loves Grandma’s cinnamon rolls.  I didn’t want to make cinnamon rolls because I knew they would pale in comparison to Grandma’s, but then I found a recipe in my inbox for Cinnamon Bun Pie, and that’s all she wrote.

If I had any question that Cinnamon Bun Pie was the right choice, it was obliterated by the date on the email: November 5, 2010. Not only is a recipe I’ve had for over a year long overdue for baking, but November 5 is my mom’s birthday. This was a coincidence (or was it?) that I simply could not ignore.

 

So I present to you a Cinnamon Bun Pie for Grandma M. The recipe can be easily halved to make one pie rather than two, or a whole recipe can be baked in a 9 x 13 dish for cinnamon bun bars. I used a my stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to knead the dough, but I did a few kneads by hand to really pull the dough together. A well-floured surface goes a long way to alleviate the stickiness of working with this dough. I also found it easier to work with the dough in two parts–rolling out two rectangles and cutting the rolls accordingly.

Though intrigued by something as enticing as Cinnamon Bun Pie, this dish is really just cinnamon buns baked in a pie dish. Kind of disappointing, but delicious none the less. and if anything, it’s a unique presentation on a standard dish. Please beware that cutting into the center of a roll may result in a piece of pie that falls apart. It is best to cut along the seams of where the rolls come together at the outer edge of the crust.

As for the taste, I really liked how some of the brown sugar and butter that melted to the bottom of the pie pan created a toffee-like layer on the rolls once cooled. And of course the cream cheese frosting is ooey-gooey deliciousness. For an extra kick of flavor, sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the pie. Though tasty at room temperature, the cinnamon buns are best enjoyed warm–either fresh out of the oven or after a quick reheat in the microwave. On second thought, Cinnamon Bun Pie is better when it is warm, but it is best enjoyed while sipping a mug of coffee with Grandma.

Happy Birthday Grandma!

 Rustic Root Shepherd’s Pie 

 2 Mar 
 

March. If it’s come in like a lion, you may want to try out some lamb in this Shepherd’s Pie. I plucked this recipe from giant my binder of recipes that houses all of my magazine clippings, and  I giggled a bit when I saw it came from Men’s Journal. Where on earth did I pick up a Men’s Journal? Or better yet, why?

Regardless, I’m glad I had it because the recipe resulted in a delicious Shepherd’s Pie. I’d never cooked with parsnips or turnips before, and unless it’s a potato or the occasional carrot, I’m generally not thrilled with root vegetables (beets have been my least favorite food since infancy).  I happily found all of the vegetables in this dish pleased my taste buds,  and overall the Shepherd’s Pie had a sweet yet tangy flavor I fancied. 

 

I got my second laugh when I read the “three beers that will perfect your meal” portion of the recipe. It started, “The knee-jerk choice is Guinness…” I used Guinness because: a) I like it and b) my local grocery store ran a promotion on it last week. Men’s Health may call it“knee-jerk”, but I call that a“win-win.”

I wanted to up the flavor by topping the Shepherd’s Pie with special mashed potatoes like my Grandma makes. I roughly halved her recipe that calls for cream cheese and sour cream to be whipped into the potatoes, and I included it in the notes below. I opted not to peel my potatoes before boiling and mashing, but of course, that option is yours.

 

The Shepherd’s Pie I cooked up was very juicy. You may want to place the cast iron skillet on a baking sheet to avoid drips of grease falling from the skillet, causing a small oven fire, and leading to shouts of, “ there’s a fire in the oven, there’s a fire in the oven .” (Yes, I’m speaking from  personal experience here.)

If you do not own a cast iron skillet, not to worry, you can always cook the Shepherd’s Pie mixture in a regular skillet and transfer it to an oven-safe dish for baking. Enjoy!
