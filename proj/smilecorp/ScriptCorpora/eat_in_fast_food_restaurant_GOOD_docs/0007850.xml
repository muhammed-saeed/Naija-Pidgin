Welcome to My Wendy’s

 Your Wendy’s? Really?

There is a noticeable difference in the drive-thru at the Wendy’s fast food restaurant down the road from my apartment. As you pull up to the speaker, its digital display lit up with the latest promotions, you will hear“Welcome to my Wendy’s, how may I help you?”(emphasis mine.)

I first noticed this change in greeting about two months ago, but thought I had just misheard the employee. But on each return visit I’ve heard it again:“Welcome to my Wendy’s, how may I help you?”This simple two-letter word holds a great deal of power for both the customer and the Wendy’s employee. But is this a smart move?

A Sense of Ownership

There’s a lot to be said about creating a sense of ownership in your employees. During my days with Ritz Camera , our district and regional managers would embolden their store managers to “run it like you own it.” And while some would use this as license to go renegade and disregard established policies, others would step up to the plate; taking initiative to make their store the very best that it could be. Because let’s face it, when you own something you generally want to see it thrive and survive!

I carried these principles with me in youth ministry. In 2006, when I was working as a volunteer assistant youth pastor, I launch a program called MyMinistry . I needed to find a way to get otherwise unmotivated teenagers to take an active part in the weekly operation of the youth ministry. If they felt it was their ministry instead of just a youth group that they attended, then perhaps they would contribute to the whole.

That’s the purpose behind this concept. An employee who feels personally responsible will generally act more responsible. He will take the initiative to complete tasks, satisfy customers, and increase productivity. So how do you go about this without actually turning the deed over to your employees? It would stand to reason that the My Wendy’s Program, as it’s being called by company insiders, is doing just that. Utilizing self-inculcation, training meetings, and company propaganda, the employee may start to think and act as if it we’re really her Wendy’s.

I applaud Wendy’s for trying to increase employee productivity in such a positive way. It’s refreshing to see a large corporation take interest in their employee’s in such a human way. Too often, corporations try to enact such change through impersonal and out of touch policies and goal setting. It’s a powerful thing when you can make an impact by creating a positive, people-oriented change to the organization’s culture. But from the outside looking in, this doesn’t look good.

What the Customer Sees, Thinks, Feels

In retail and restaurants , you’ll find a common trend toward making the customer feel at home. Take for example Olive Garden ‘s advertising campaign that states “When you’re here, you’re family,” or the billions of dollars (that’s right…billions) spent by McDonald’s to renovate existing restaurants in their chain to a more comfortable feel. The reason behind this trend is that studies indicate that the more comfortable and welcomed a customer feels in your business, the more they will spend and the more likely they are to return. Seems logical right? So while I appreciate the intent behind the My Wendy’s program , it doesn’t make a customer feel very welcome. You’re welcome to tell your staff that it’s their Wendy’s until you’re blue in the face, but a customer wants to hear that it’s their restaurant (as Burger King would say, I can “have it my way.” )

Perhaps it goes back to my Ritz Camera days where we were so often told things like“The customer is the lifeblood of our business. If we don’t take care of our customers, someone else will.”And maybe I’m splitting hairs here, but something just seems incredibly opposed to customer orientation when an employee says so emphatically My Wendy’s. It just seems diametrically opposed to the concept of making customers feel at home. There’s no “mi casa su casa” when you’re informing me that it’s your Wendy’s. 

And you’re certainly not garnering any brownie points in hospitality when you follow up your My Wendy’s statement with lackluster service. Even someone with my corporate background has a hard time measuring the merits of instilling a sense of ownership in your employees when the service is sub par. The last two times I have visited this restaurant, my fries tasted old and my sandwich had tomato on it, even after I specifically asked for no tomato. Add to that the fact that the digital display never displayed my order or my total!

Final Thoughts

Wendy’s made the right move when it dumped it’s struggling Arby’s chain . But for a company that has struggled to position itself in the hyper-competitive fast food world, they should take note of the counter-productiveness of their My Wendy’s program. While it holds merit from a corporate culture standpoint, it goes against the grain of the consumer and economic demands for a restaurant that feels like home. Factor in the disappointing service, and one can only imagine how disappointed Dave Thomas would be. Perhaps this will serve as a warning to the service industries…Don’t mix your incompatible internal propaganda with your marketing efforts, especially if you can’t deliver quality service to back it up.

I like what Walmart use to say,“The customer is always right”!!! We got no arguments from the employees then…and Wendy’s?? are you kidding?? most of those greetings are pre-recorded…..I thought the clerk was doing a good job of greeting until I realized it was recorded and then I had to laugh and I told her, boy that was a mouthful!!! I guess to get you to eat at Wendy’s they would have to make you feel like you owned it or other wise you wouldn’t eat there at all….”nasty”….LOL

One of my district managers at Ritz Camera always taught that“the customer ISN’T always right, but the customer IS always the customer”and should be treated accordingly. Powerful wisdom.
