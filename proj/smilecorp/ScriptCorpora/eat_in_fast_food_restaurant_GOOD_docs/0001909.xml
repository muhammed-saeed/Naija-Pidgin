 Missing AZ 5-year-old now believed to have been killed and dumped in trash

GLENDALE (AP) - Police said Wednesday they now believe a 5-year-old Arizona girl missing for more than two months was killed and that her body was dumped in a trash bin across town.

That&apos;s the most substantive information that police in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale have released about what they believe happened to Jhessye Shockley, who was reported missing Oct. 11.

Police didn&apos;t specify who they think killed the little girl.

A month ago, detectives arrested Jhessye&apos;s mother, Jerice Hunter, on a child abuse charge related to the girl and announced at the time that they didn&apos;t believe they&apos;d find her alive.

Hunter was released days after her Nov. 21 arrest when prosecutors said they wanted further investigation. She has maintained she had nothing to do with her daughter&apos;s disappearance, and has been critical of investigators.

Police say Hunter has declined to submit to a lie-detector test.

Jhessye was last seen at her family&apos;s apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale after Hunter said she went out for an errand and left the girl in the care of three older siblings

Police previously said they don&apos;t believe they will find the child alive.

According to court documents released last month, Jhessye&apos;s teenage sister told police that Hunter had instructed her to lie about the disappearance. She also said her mother kept Jhessye in a closet, and that the girl had cuts, black eyes and other bruises before she was reported missing.

Child welfare workers removed Hunter&apos;s other children, including a newborn, from her apartment in October but declined to say why.

Hunter came under scrutiny during the investigation for an October 2005 arrest with her then-husband, George Shockley, on child abuse charges in California. Hunter pleaded no contest to corporal punishment and served about four years in prison before she was released on parole in May 2010.

Hunter&apos;s oldest child, 14 at the time, has told police his mother routinely beat the children. George Shockley is a convicted sex offender and is still in a California prison.
