Why waste your time at gatherings of like-minded skeptics when you could be engaging with people who might actually benefit from what you have to say, asks Alom Shaha 

If you&apos;re reading this, you probably know that homeopathy is an entirely made-up pretend medicine that has somehow become accepted by millions of people as &quot;real&quot; medicine. You probably know that no one actually has psychic powers and that no aliens have ever landed on this planet, but humans have certainly landed on the moon . I can confidently assert these things about you because you&apos;re reading this on the Guardian Science Blog and, let&apos;s be honest, that makes you a Guardian Reader.

Don&apos;t like that label but want to show off that you&apos;re super smart and rational? You might want to call yourself a &quot;skeptic&quot; (and make sure you spell it with a &quot;k&quot;). Then you can meet up with other skeptics and nod along with them as someone lectures you in a pub ( yes, a pub! ) about these things that you already know. You can enjoy a few pints and can go home having had your belief in how smart and rational you are confirmed.

There&apos;ll sometimes be &quot;celebrities&quot; at these events, you know – people with more followers than you on Twitter, maybe even someone who is followed by Stephen Fry. There might even be a Guardian science blogger if you&apos;re lucky.

Once a year, you might get to go to a big conference (no, of course it&apos;s not a pilgrimage) and hear really famous people talk about these same things, maybe even Stephen Fry himself. And all the while you&apos;re there you&apos;ll tweet about it, so that everybody knows that you agree with everyone else about just how brilliant the brilliant minds assembled before you are. If only the rest of the world thought the same way you and your friends do. Wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful? And you&apos;ll tell yourself this isn&apos;t really like church. After all, religion is all about believing in God, isn&apos;t it? And you don&apos;t believe in God. You&apos;re far too rational for that.

Ok, I&apos;m going to own up – I am deliberately &quot;skeptic baiting&quot;. Some people have accused me of doing this on Twitter, simply because I raised a few questions about what I see as a failure of the UK skeptic movement to fully engage with audiences which might really benefit from being exposed to the kind of ideas about critical thinking that skeptics espouse.

I&apos;m not alone in thinking that people from ethnic minorities are under-represented in skeptic groups . I had to bite my tongue when told by a skeptic in a pub that &quot;they&apos;re not interested in these things&quot; because otherwise I would have had to point out that they were perilously close to saying &quot;you&apos;re not like the rest of them&quot;, that favourite get-out clause for my racist childhood friends. Recent experiences in my own life, since &quot;coming out&quot; as an ex-Muslim atheist , have led me to believe that there is a pressing need to create opportunities for people from Muslim backgrounds to engage with skeptic and atheist movements.

There are cultural issues that make it difficult for people from certain backgrounds to engage with other skeptics or to be openly sceptical about things like religion or &quot;alternative&quot; medicine. The mainstream skeptic community should be aware of this and do what they can to help support those less fortunate than themselves. It&apos;s not good enough to tell people with concerns like mine that &quot;no one can prevent you from setting up a forum for black atheists&quot; .

But that&apos;s not the only aspect of the UK skeptic movement that I think needs challenging. To me, it looks like skeptics spend a large part of their efforts &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; or trying to change the minds of people who are just never going to change their minds. I see little evidence of the UK skeptic movement targeting that group of people who are still in the process of deciding what to believe and how to think about the world: children.

There is a genuine need to help young people improve their critical thinking skills. It seems to me that campaigning to make the teaching of critical thinking more important in schools, or creating resources to help schools teach it, might be useful things for skeptics to do. Tim Minchin&apos;s Pope Song is a work of genius, but it&apos;s hardly appropriate for use in schools. How about putting some of that imagination and creativity to work producing stuff that might get used in school religious education or science lessons?

If you&apos;re poor or if you&apos;re from a strictly religious family, like many of my students are, then it&apos;s likely that school is the only place you might ever get to listen to and engage with someone like Richard Dawkins in person. So, instead of getting these brilliant people to go and talk in pubs or at conferences, where everybody already knows what they&apos;re going to say, why not get them into schools where they might inspire a new generation of skeptics?

Sure, there are practical hurdles and you&apos;ll need to find out a little about the rules and regulations that schools have about these things, but a lot of schools already have external speaker programmes and many would welcome the calibre of speaker that Skeptics in the Pub attracts. Children are natural skeptics, they want to challenge authority and doctrine – help them do so.

Let me be clear: I know of, and hugely admire, the good work that many skeptics do, for example when they challenge the false advertising of &quot;alternative&quot; medicine and the inappropriate use of NHS funds, and expose the charlatans who make money by lying to the bereaved and desperate.

I&apos;m glad there is a skeptic movement in the UK. I&apos;m glad that skeptics have a sense of community and find ways to hang out together and celebrate their common beliefs. These things are important – ask any churchgoer. But if skeptics are going to live up to some of the crusading hype that often accompanies their rhetoric, they&apos;re going to have to step out of the pub far more often.

Earlier this week, we asked which songs rewind you back to the age of the Sony Walkman. Here are your favourites ...

 Gitfinger – Level 42&apos;s World Machine album: &quot;I wore out both Walkman and cassette in 1986&quot;

 kyzajai – Beastie Boy&apos;s, Pearl Jam – 1990: &quot;Love them at the time listening to Beastie Boy&apos;s, Pearl Jam..and many others on the way to school&quot;

 racingsnake – Gerry Rafferty&apos;s Baker Street: &quot;I couldn&apos;t afford the Sony, so I got a Sanyo (and still have it...), which I used while delivering stuff around Central London in the early 80s. Tracks/albums which bring those summers back to me are: Gerry Rafferty&apos;s &apos;Baker Street&apos; (while winding my way down it, naturally&quot;

 WiredofHermiston – Come Back by the Mighty Wah and Eyes Without a Face by Billy Idol: &quot;Particularly remember one compo tape from the summer of 1984 that had Come Back by the Mighty Wah and Eyes Without a Face by Billy Idol on it&quot;

 StrokerAce – Cliff, Wired for Sound: &quot;urge any walkman fans to get themselves onto YouTube post haste and watch the video for Wired for Sound by Cliff Richard.&quot;

 radiothom – &quot;radiohead&apos;s &quot;creep&quot; single with my first ever b-side discovery &apos;faithless the wonder boy&apos;&quot;

 WiredofHermiston – The Best of the Stranglers: &quot;The only actual albums I had were The Best of the Stranglers (Christmas present from brother who clearly just wanted it for himself) and, rather oddly, an early Elton John album, Honky Chateau I think.&quot;

 mcragg – MJ Black Or White: &quot;There&apos;s a picture of me sat with the walkman resting on my shellsuit-covered lap, eyes closed in sheer joy at listening to a slightly slowed down version of Black Or White, aged 10.&quot;

 Paulhalsall – Mahler: &quot;For me the high point was using a Walkman to go around Venice on the vaporetti listening to Mahler&quot;

 russellhiggs – PIL, the Associates and Pere Ubu: &quot;I lived in a double bedsit in Notting Hill, with a rent of £30 a week. I remember walking through Kensington Gardens with my Walkman. Listening to PIL, the Associates and Pere Ubu&quot;

 startchoppin : &quot;very first walkman i got given was on a holiday around 1980 and i was given cassettes of boney m&apos;s &quot;nightlfight to venus&quot;, the village people&apos;s &quot;you can&apos;t stop the music&quot;, blondie&apos;s &quot;auto-american&quot; and the soundtrack to the empire strikes back&quot;

 girish89 – Savage Garden and Boyzone: &quot;Was amazed when i found out you could skip tracks in the more expensive model! I was always used to guess when rewinding or fast forwarding to find the track i needed&quot;

 tobyd – Use Your Illusion 2 by Guns N&apos; Roses: &quot;school trip to France in &apos;91 or &apos;92, many hours in a coach listening to Use Your Illusion 2 by Guns N&apos; Roses&quot;

 catfacebaldwin – Kylie: &quot;My first Walkman was a yellow Sony complete with a Kylie album. That one where she wears that big gold hat. 8th birthday.&quot;

 Zethes- – Bon Jovi – Slippery When WetWhitesnake – Whitesnake: &quot;Oh I was so cool. I&apos;d just discovered hair gel (the really cheap stuff you got in a pot with a screw top lid), I had my hair totally slicked back, and I would skateboard up and down the culdesac. Singing out the power lyrics, such as &apos;makin love in the back seat&apos; to show everyone (well, various passing cats) how grown up I was. My only saving grace being that I was only 10 years old&quot;

 TheresaMalone – Sonia (You&apos;ll Never Stop me Loving You), Chesney Hawkes: &quot;I had a Grundig Beatboy - a present for being my sister&apos;s bridesmaid when I was eight. It lasted me well into my 20s, by which time my tastes in music had thankfully moved beyond Sonia, Chesney Hawkes etc.&quot;

 Datsuncog – Let Loose, East 17 and Bon Jovi, but later involved Kraftwerk, Love and Arab Strap: &quot;The Panasonic reminds me of family holidays in France. My mix tapes started off with things like Let Loose, East 17 and Bon Jovi, but later involved Kraftwerk, Love and Arab Strap&quot;

 drygoni – Monkees Greatest Hits and Songs from the Big Chair – Tears for Fears: &quot;I had a Red Sanyo (with only a FFwd button) Walkman and I played/chewed the Monkees Greatest Hits and Songs From the Big Chair (T4F) to death ... It was an early xmas present and it literally went everywhere with me&quot;

 StephanoBentos – Run DMC&apos;s Raising Hell on one side and Rush&apos;s 2112: &quot;A C-90 with Run DMC&apos;s Raising Hell on one side and Rush&apos;s 2112 on the other was my favourite tape. Bloody odd combination but those Orange Foam Headphones would blast those magnificent records into my developing brain over and over again&quot;

 chernypyos – Björk&apos;s Human Behavior and Sinead O&apos;Connor&apos;s Fire On Babylon: &quot;bjork&apos;s &apos;human behavior&apos; and sinead o&apos;connor&apos;s &quot;fire on babylon&quot; oddly stick in my head from that one evening walking in the woods, breathing the damp air, and feeling pleasantly invisible&quot;

 Pyromancer – REM – Automatic for the People
Blood Sugar Sex Magic
Pearl Jam - Vs
RATM&apos;s first album
Portishead
Maxinquaye by Tricky
Manic Street Preachers – Gold Against the Soul
Smashing Pumpkins, Siamese Dream
&quot;I used to go to the local library and take out a CD (50p for 3 weeks!), then tape it. The C90 cassettes would pretty much hold two albums, one on each side, and I still remember some of the combos I had on those old tapes.&quot;

 alioco – The Bangles – Walk like an Egyptian and Peter Cetera – Glory of Love: &quot;My first tape was a double &apos;Hits 5&apos; cassette, it had stuff like The The - Infected (I fast forwarded this), The Bangles - Walk like an Egyptian and Peter Cetera - Glory of Love&quot;

 Jiggyg – Vanila Ice and MC Hammer, Snap and 2 Unlimited: &quot;My were caressed to the warbles of Vanila Ice and MC Hammer. Now compilations were essential chistmas and Birthday presents&quot;

 Pillowhead – jive bunny: &quot;My first walkman was a red affair from boots when I was about 7 years old and I got the curiosity killed the cat album with it. This was followed by a few years of smash hit style comps, jive bunny, Vanilla Ice moving on to Queen&quot;

 Pillowhead – Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Chillis, Wildhearts, Therapy: &quot;Also sitting around at break and lunch sharing an earphone each with friends of if you were lucky a girl. The soundtrack was all Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Chillis, Wildhearts, Therapy and generally any early to mids 90s alternative rock. Better days.....&quot;

 silkpurse – Neville Brothers Yellow Moon : &quot;Spent most of one summer as a builder listening to the Neville Brothers &quot;Yellow Moon &quot;. on a shiny yellow Walkman with a secure snap closer. That&apos;s when I learned about Daniel Lanois&quot;

 MandrakeMan – Prince, 1999 : &quot;Prince, 1999 double album, 2 vinyl sides per cassette side, perfect length to do my paper round to&quot;

 nickmannion : &quot;was latecomer (mine was a combined radio too!) but during a very dark period of my life, tapes I made of Peter Green era Fleetwod Mac (the best blues player in the history of ever...) and Free (best band in history of blah blah...) virtually saved me from an early exit....&quot;

 Katewashere : &quot;My Dad bought me a walkman in 1984. The first thing I listened to was the Flashdance soundtrack - the opening chords of What a Feeling felt like electricity was coursing through my body. Similar to that bit in Back to the Future where Marty plays Iron Maiden to his Dad while pretending to be a space man. Dad thought his brain was melting. Not surprised!&quot;
stumbuffer -&quot;every day, walking to school, listening to &quot;never mind the bollocks&quot;&quot;

 jonnyduk : &quot;I bought my first one in 1985. It was blue and I loved it. Fond memories of cycling back from the pub listening to Desire by Dylan and Stop Making Sense by Talking Heads - not the safest thing to do in the world to do after a few pints but hey, I was 18!&quot;

 PhilJones87 : &quot;The tape in the Walkman was 100% Reggae from 1994. The rest of the box was full of gangsta rap, which my embarrassed Mum used to love listening to as she drove around a load of 11 year olds. Guns N Roses - Spaghetti Incident was in there too, but we won&apos;t say anymore about that.&quot;

 Grimmers : &quot;My first personal stereo was a Boots own brand model which I got for Christmas in 1992 - I only owned two albums at that point (Divine Madness and Queen&apos;s Greatest Hits II) but I did tape a lot of songs off the radio&quot;

 texavery : &quot;A freshly taped copy of De la souls 3 feet high and rising and U2&apos;s under a blood red sky are indelibly printed in my mind when I think of personal stereos.&quot;

 Sometimes The On Camera Flash Works

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   Everyone says your little popup flash on your camera is about the most useless piece of gear.   In general, when used at full tilt with it firing at the start of the exposure, “they” are typically right.   There are ways to improve the results of that ridiculous point source, on axis blast of light.   Today’s image is an example of what “could be” the result of a couple of simple adjustments done in camera and some new finishing techniques available in Adobe Photoshop CS5.   The pup with the intent look on his face was sitting in the front seat of a car in Litchfield Connecticut last Saturday.   The window was open and the day was a beautiful, warm (not hot) fall afternoon.   He had his head just above the sill of the window and appeared to be looked for his master.   We had been walking around town with a couple of friends, shooting general interest shots and waiting for the sun to go down and the moon to rise.   As it happened, the two conditions were just about in sync with each other.   Sunset was a couple of minutes before 6:00 PM and moon rise was about 6:03 PM.   We spotted this little guy being as patient as could be as we were killing some time.   To get an idea what the camera settings were and what the “new” finishing technique is, hit the “read more”. Blasting away with the on camera flash is a recipe for disaster. “Normal” conditions would be TTL metering and front curtain sync. The settings for this shot were Slow Rear Curtain and a one stop reduction in the flash power. This, coupled with a -.3 general EV (Exposure Value), gave a very subtle pop of light. Rear Curtain sync fires the flash at the end of the exposure rather than at the beginning. This allows the ambient light to do the general illumination of the area and the flash freezes the subject. Reducing the flashes power level by one stop insures a very light touch of light rather than a blast of light. On a Nikon D300 the adjustment is made with a button just below the flash popup button and turning the settings wheel. This is a flash specific adjustment. It also works with shoe mounted speedlites. Adjusting the camera’s EV is a global adjustment. Therefore it affects both the camera’s setting and the speedlite’s setting. Very small pops of fill light can be produced using all the controls available on camera. 

Dave Cross just did a class on Kelby Training about painting using a beta plugin available from http://labs.adobe.com called Pixel Bender. As it comes it has several options included in its galley. It also had a community being built up around it for people to add to the gallery selections adding many different effects. Dave’s class and today’s image use the Oil Painting selection. The first pass produced enough interest to keep on exploring what could be done.

The dog was sitting in such a manner as to show the passenger seat back, the gap between the seats and a portion of the driver’s seat. In the B&amp;W conversion, that resulted in a grey, black , grey pattern that distracted from the image. The window and door showed just below his chin. The fix was to turn the entire background black and create today’s dramatic portrait of a small dog. What should have been a reference shot or just a fun capture has become a study. Let me know what you think. Thanks

One of the formative events in my journey toward cinephilia was finding a copy of Cathal Tohill and Pete Tombs&apos; invaluable text on European art film and sexploitation, Immoral Tales . I would open it randomly to a page almost daily and find some of the most interesting sounding films at my fingertips. I haven&apos;t yet managed to watch all of them, I man never manage that, but it gave me a point of departure for exploring the very specific type of of film really only made in Europe in the late 50&apos;s through the 70&apos;s. The auteurs given greatest attention in the boook have turned out to be some of my favorites, the kind of people who could make a sexy horror or fantasy film that felt like a work of art. Sure, some of them were trashy, many of them were over the top, and some even were pornographic, but even the bad ones had that aura that they were created by someone who really cared and put serious effort into their creation. Apparently the guys at Severin Films are on a very similar wavelength, and probably even managed to read that same book and thought it was high time that these filmmakers deserved their day in the sun. Three of the biggest names to come out of that book were Joe D&apos;amato, Walerian Borowczyk, and Jess Franco, and they all have been given the credit they are due through Severin&apos;s releases.

Joe D&apos;amato&apos;s recipe for filmmaking was pretty simple: sex + violence = entertainment. It really is hard to argue with that logic, however, it has been done by thousands of other filmmakers and few of them have gained his reputation. I think much of his success in his niche comes from his commitment. With a history of nearly two hundred films, he made probably more than his fair share of clunkers, however, many of his films are eminently watchable, and some are considered classics of the 70&apos;s sex/horror hybrid genre. Severin has resurrected a little bit of both types in their catalog so far. My personal favorites are D&apos;amato&apos;s contributions to Laura Gemser&apos;s Black Emanuelle series, available either in Black Emanuelle Vols. 1&amp;2 , or on their own.  The first collection includes Emanuelle in Bangkok and Emanuelle Around the World , each notorious for the amount of adult action, and at least the former of which was released in a XXX edition not found in this collection. The box itself is a great little package, including a gatefold cover of Gemser, and a CD of soundtrack collections as well as lobby card reproductions and video interviews with D&apos;amato himself and composer Nico Fidenco. The second collection includes D&apos;amato&apos;s Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade , which is just as exploitative and entertaining as its title suggests. That disc also includes an interview with Joe D&apos;amato, great stuff all around. Each of the Black Emanuelle titles are also available alone.

As I mentioned above, D&apos;amato specialized in the confluence of sex and violence and Severin have released two these films to great acclaim.  The Alcove also stars Laura Gemser as an African princess turned slave and made subject to the whims of a military officer. She is dragged into a world of drugs, sex, and all around deviance. D&apos;amato&apos;s Papaya: Love Goddess of the Cannibals , veers further into the dark with a tale of cannibalism and sex! I think this film requires no other reccomendation than the fact that it includes something referred to as the &quot;Disco Cannibal Blood Orgy&quot; sequence. The film also features Sirpa Lane, who is probably better known for her tryst with Bigfoot in Borowczyk&apos;s The Beast . D&apos;amato is also the mind behind classics like Erotic Nights of the Living Dead and other similar films, but I&apos;m glad that Severin have taken such good care of his entries in the Black Emanuelle series, first and foremost.

Walerian Borowczyk is not a name often mentioned when people talk about the great auteurs of the European new wave, and, really, I don&apos;t know that he was that influential. For me, regarding someone as influential insinuates that he has followers and people who attempt to copy his work, and Borowczyk was such a singular mind and talent, that I don&apos;t think that was really a problem, outside of a very few people. Severin have taken an interest in his work that is really only equaled by Cult Epics in this country. First up in the Severin collection is Immoral Women , a bizarrely erotic tale of women, um, being immoral. It really must be seen to be believed. Borowczyk was nothing if not an envelope pusher, and this film is only one of his more notorious works. Severin have found the original European negatives and restored the film to its full length so admirers and critics alike have the opportunity to make up their minds based upon Borowczyk&apos;s original intentions. Severin have also released one of Borowczyk&apos;s final films, Art Of Love , and the finale of his Immoral Trilogy (alongside Immoral Tales and Immoral Women ). He takes a characteristically skewed look at eroticism in this film, Borowczyk&apos;s films are definitely an acquired taste, and may not be your cup of tea, but they are most certainly unforgettable.

The final, and perhaps most well-known of the trio is Jess Franco. Severin and Blue Underground share an affection for Franco and his films, however, I think Severin take the win for releasing some more obscure titles. Among Severin&apos;s current titles are Devil Hunter , Bloody Moon , Mansion of the Living Dead , and Macumba Sexual , all typically bizarre, erotic, and violent examples of Franco&apos;s oeuvre. The first two of these titles made it onto Britain&apos;s notorious Video Nasty list, making them prime fodder for slasher collectors, it didn&apos;t hurt that they both contained prime examples of everything your parents feared most. Cannibalism, sex, carnage, nothing was off the table, and here Severin have presented them uncut and restored for the first time in the USA!  Mansion of the Living Dead and Macumba Sexual lean more toward the sex end of sexploitation, which is not at all foreign to Franco. Both films highlight his trademark sense of sensuality even in the midst of the darkest of subjects, and both films feature the lovely Lina Romay, Franco&apos;s longtime partner and wife.  Mansion of the Living Dead combines the Blind Dead mainstays, the Templar zombies with nubile young waitresses exploring their sexuality. Again, these two films have never been made available uncut in the USA until now. All four films feature interviews with Jess Franco about the material, which is very informative, and I&apos;ve gotten word that Severin was working on even more Franco titles with more interviews, still! 

This trio of talents didn&apos;t always make winners, some of the films were truly just potboilers, however, they have left an inedible mark on European cinema, which filmmakers today mustn&apos;t ignore. Sure, I suppose most people would want to wipe that mark away, but there are enough of us hungry to see these films and try to imagine what evil lurks in the minds of these men that I hope Severin are able to continue their work. Lord knows, there are plenty of D&apos;amato&apos;s and Franco&apos;s left that haven&apos;t been released!

Keep watching, next time I&apos;ll take on some of Severin&apos;s more horrifying entries...

&quot;Shrinkage&quot; by Latchkey Wife

I groaned as the bright sun seeped under my eyelids. I had fallen asleep on the beach again and my once perfectly-positioned umbrella was now failing miserably at its job. Fucker. Momentarily forgetting where I was, I looked around to find the beach had filled up since I claimed my spot early this morning. Everyone was taking full advantage of an unusually warm, late-September day. I was surprised the screaming children had not woken me up. Why are the damn kids always screaming? Is it some unspoken rule of the beach that all children should lose the inability to talk quietly? Fuck me.

And then I looked down. What the...? Fucked if I didn&apos;t fall asleep with my hand in my bathing suit bottoms. This had been happening a lot lately, but luckily, it was in the privacy of my own bedroom. And it always coincided with one very hot, re-occurring dream about one sexy stranger. One sexy, green-eyed, tousle-haired stranger.

I quickly glanced around to my various beach neighbors to see if anyone had noticed me sexually abusing myself. No one was throwing me any funny looks so I must be ok. I just hoped that during my erotic dream, I&apos;d kept the writhing and moaning to a minimum. Fucking awesome, Bella, going all NC-17 on the beach. Way to go, you horny bitch. Tip for next time: more caffeine before sun bathing and no more falling asleep in public until I get these crazy dreams in check.

For weeks now almost every morning I&apos;ve woken up soaked. Hand in my panties. Drenched. The most erotic dreams I’ve ever had and always with my sexy stranger. I wasn&apos;t one to remember dreams, let alone be so completely owned by them. Why did I always have to wake up just before the dream got good and steamy... just as I was starting to grind all up on his hard cock, always seconds before we both got completely naked? It was like someone was playing a cruel joke on me. Letting me get enough dreamy friction to heat me up enough to shove my hand down my own pants in public is just going too far.

I can picture him like he&apos;s standing next to me. His wild mop of streaked bronze hair I imagine shimmered in the sun. His deep green eyes were partially hidden under long, dark lashes, and he had the most amazing jaw line covered by several days of stubble. He stood just over six feet, slender but chiseled. God, I got fucking weak-kneed just thinking about him.

I shook myself out of the fantasy, blinked the sleep from my eyes and flipped over onto my stomach to do some reading. I, for some reason, had to point my head towards the ocean even though I was almost always heading somewhat downhill. I loved watching people high-step into the icy Maine water, jumping out of the way of the waves, never really able to avoid the frigid spray. I also figure if I lay on my stomach and mistakenly fall asleep, it will be much harder to get my hand back in my pants. Fuck me.

Ok, I lied. The main reason I love facing the water is for the show those French tourists put on with their banana hammock bathing suits. I giggled to myself remembering a certain episode of Seinfeld where George has issues with shrinkage in the cold water. And so did just about every dude stupid enough to venture into the freezing water here - most of them tourists, of course. Give me a break, I needed the entertainment. Or maybe I needed a better book.

Boredom set in and I was just about to pack up my things and head home when I heard a ruckus in the water. Three boys, no men, where roughhousing and splashing around in the waves. The tide was starting to get low so I couldn&apos;t see them clearly but it appeared they were tossing a football around and tackling each other in the surf. What the fuck? That water was damn cold and they were crashing around like they were in fucking Hawaii. Show offs.

I was intrigued. I&apos;ve been coming to this beach for years and it&apos;s always the same old crowd. Middle-aged tourists and families. Never hot guys. If, in fact, these guys where hot, this would be a first. I threw on my skirt and headed down to the water&apos;s edge... just to wash my feet off of course... And I was treated to three of the most gorgeous men I&apos;d seen in a very long time. But there was only one I actually really saw. I was immediately drawn into a trance by the piercing green eyes, crazy mop of copper hair, and the most sculpted, naked chest I had ever laid eyes on. I&apos;m fairly certain my mouth was hanging completely open. Awesome Bella, way to look disinterested.

Just when I thought the “L” on my forehead couldn&apos;t get any bigger, I felt a searing pain in my nose. I had been the victim of a rogue football toss, ala Marcia Brady. &quot;Oh my nose!&quot; I cried out as I fell back onto the wet, hard sand, smashing the back of my head to the ground with a thud. I quickly sat up to keep the oozing blood from spreading out all over my face. Like I wasn&apos;t embarrassed enough that I essentially had been caught red-handed gawking at these god-like men, I didn&apos;t need to look like a fucking murder victim too.

I slowly pulled my hands from my face, the blood pooling in my palms, when I noticed three pairs of very large feet surrounding me. I was almost afraid to look up. Almost afraid of what must have been written all over my face. I let my eyes trail slowly up the pair of slender yet muscular legs directly in front of me. As I reached the wet, slightly snug fitting board shorts, I noticed something. A very large something. &quot;Impossible,&quot; I muttered to myself wondering how on earth I could actually be seeing what I was seeing having just emerged from the icy water.

&quot;Aw fuck, man, are you ok?&quot; the husky voice called out. &quot;Aw shit, I’m sorry. I guess we must have gotten a little carried away with our football game. Just trying to keep the feet from going numb in that freezing water.” He finished with a chuckle.

My eyes finally reached his face after stopping for a bit on a wet and stunningly gorgeous chest. I couldn&apos;t speak. I was frozen, as if I&apos;d been the one playing in the water. Staring back at me were the piercing emerald eyes that had haunted my dreams. Ok, maybe haunted wasn&apos;t the right word for the completely erotic, wet dreams those eyes had been a part of. The wild mop of bronze-colored hair, the chiseled jaw... it was all there. Exactly as it had been in my dream.

&quot;I can&apos;t fucking believe I just got hit in da node with a fucking football. Am I being punked? Is da real Marcia Brady hiding somewhere? Fuck me.&quot; I winced as I touched a hand to my quickly swelling nose.

The green-eyed god&apos;s two friends had taken off when they saw the blood in search of a towel to mop up the carnage my face had become. How utterly fucking embarrassing. I finally meet the man of my dreams, literally, and here I am with a nose that’s starting to swell to the size of Texas. Yay me.

&quot;Hey listen. I&apos;m really sorry about this. Here, let me help you up,&quot; he offered as he reached down to grab one of my bloody hands. &quot;I fucking told my brother to stop trying to act like Tom Brady, but nooo... he always has to take it too far.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;d like to kick your brother in the nuts,&quot; I mumbled, accepting the strong hand and pulling myself up, never wanting to let go.

&quot;Huh?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I said, you&apos;re brother sounds like a putz.&quot;

&quot;Nah, he just gets overly excited with anything football-related,&quot; he joked. &quot;I&apos;m Edward, by the way. Are you here on vacation?&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; I said, popping the p for effect. &quot;I live here year round. You?&quot;

&quot;We just moved into that light blue house just past that little white cottage right over there,” he replied, excitedly pointing just down the beach. “I didn&apos;t catch your name.&quot;

The house just past that little white cottage? Fuck me, I lived in the little white cottage! Mother fucker, this Adonis is my new neighbor. &quot;I&apos;m B-Bella.” I stuttered, trying not to look shell shocked at the idea of new neighbors. How the fuck was I going to survive with that crew living next door? Hello sweaty, dream-filled nights. I was going to need an industrial strength vibrator and a lifetime supply of batteries.

The other two friends came running back to me with damp towels to mop up my mess and some ice for my nose. Aw, I think I love these men already. &quot;Guys, this is Bella. She lives around here. Bella, this is my brother Emmett and his um, friend Jasper.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you Bella,&quot; Emmett said with a smile as he grabbed Jasper&apos;s hand. Jasper nodded, not very chatty, that one. I guess I know those two are off the market. &quot;So since we&apos;re new in town, maybe you could show us around. Give us the lowdown on the places to go. Places to avoid,&quot; Emmett continued, obviously excited to meet a local.

&quot;Ah sure, maybe sometime. Right now, I just gotta get home and lay down. My face is fucking throbbing,&quot; I snapped, not entirely in the mood for fucking small talk feeling my nose slowly getting bigger and bigger. I really didn&apos;t think it was broken, not from a football toss, so I decided against a trip to the emergency room.

&quot;Can we help you get your stuff home?&quot; Edward asked as I started walking back towards my blanket. &quot;Do you live close by?&quot; I could tell he felt horrible about what had just happened.

&quot;Sure, that would be great,&quot; secretly wanting him to know I was his neighbor. &quot;I live in that little white cottage.&quot; Wait for it... wait for it...

&quot;No fucking way! You mean we&apos;re neighbors? Guys, she lives in the little white place,&quot; he yelled back to Emmett and Jasper as they followed behind hand in hand. Emmett raised a hand in acknowledgment. Jasper walked with his head down. Odd duck, that one. Or maybe he’s just a little shy about Emmett&apos;s obvious PDA.

We gathered up my belongings and made our way to my house. Emmett and Jasper bid a farewell and trotted back down to the beach, while Edward made sure I got settled in okay. I was desperate for a handful of Advil and a Vodka rocks right about now. I think that would make me forget all about my giant nose. And some other stuff too. It was definitely close enough to 5 o&apos;clock!

&quot;Do you live here alone?&quot; Edward asked as he wandered around the cozy living room checking out the décor.

&quot;This time of year I do,&quot; I yelled from the bathroom, desperately scouring the medicine cabinet for some sort of pain relief. &quot;My roommate Alice has gone back to school already, she started in mid-August so she won&apos;t be back until Thanksgiving. So yes, right now it&apos;s just me.&quot;

&quot;Really? Cool. What do you do with your days? Do you go to school too or do you work?&quot; He asked as shot me a crooked smile that I&apos;ll admit, made me a tiny bit wet.

&quot;I, um, well, nothing really. I&apos;m a freelance writer so I pretty much do whatever I want.&quot; I didn&apos;t really think I needed to get into the whole where-I-got-my-money issue. Not now. I just fucking met the guy, even though I feel like I&apos;ve known him for weeks. In the biblical sense anyway.

&quot;Sounds great. Well, I don&apos;t want to overstay my welcome. I&apos;ll leave you to your painkillers and what? You&apos;re not downing those pills with straight vodka are you? Geez, Bella. Fuck, now I&apos;m going to have to come check on you later to make sure you&apos;re not in a coma.&quot;

That&apos;s the idea my friend. I am evil.

After Edward left, I jumped in the shower to rinse off the day – the sand, the sunscreen, the dried blood – I was a fucking mess. A nice hot shower, a cold glass of Vodka and a couple dozen Advil and I was going to be in for a very nice evening. I planned on getting myself very drunk and then possibly taking advantage of me later. After being treated to dream boy today on the beach, I only hoped I was stocked up on batteries. It was going to be a long, lonely night.

The sun had set by the time I pulled my pruned ass out of the shower. The hot water finally waving its white flag as I spent long enough in the spray washing away the day to polish off a tall glass of vodka. I was feeling slightly buzzed from the one drink and the pills, and knew it wouldn’t be long before I gave into myself.

After I dried off, I felt the need to get myself a drink refill so I wrapped myself up in my towel, grabbed another vodka and flopped down on the couch to relax a minute. Man, my face was pounding from the beach injury.

I thought I heard someone knocking on the front door. Who the fuck could that be? I went to peak through the curtain to see who was interrupting my slow seduction of myself. Fuck me. It was a freshly showered, squeaky-clean Edward with a bottle of Grey Goose and a bag of groceries. Hmmm… feeling pretty sure of your self aren’t you big boy? God, I hoped he was a big boy. Game on.

I arranged the towel so it just covered all the vitals and whipped open the door. “Mike, you’re early… oh, sorry, you are definitely not Mike.”

“Oh, hey, sorry. Didn’t know you had plans tonight,” Edward said sheepishly as he backed away from the front door. He was obviously trying not to stare directly at my scantily clad figure. And I was strategically moving the towel around so I’m sure he got a glimpse or two of some privates. Not like that was my plan or anything.

“That’s cool. He’s not supposed to be here for another hour so if you wanna come in and have a quick drink, that would be great. I’m really thirsty and it looks like you came bearing gifts. I’m going to get some clothes on,” and with that I turned on my heel to head to the bedroom, leaving him my completely exposed backside as a parting gift. That will teach you for showing up at my front door unannounced.

Of course, I never had any plans with Mike, but he doesn’t have to know about that. I scurried back to my room and shut the door and called Alice. “Al, holy fuck, you have to do me a favor,” I whispered into the phone.

“Whoa, B, what the fuck is going on? Why are you being so weird?” she asked, putting on her ‘I mean business’ tone with me.

“Aw fuck me Alice. Do you remember the dreams I’ve been having lately? Those erotic fucking dreams about that hot guy?”

“Yup. What happened – did he just show up at your front door or something?”

“Um, ya, something like that. I met him on the beach today. I shit you not,” I said, still doing my best whispery voice.

“Ho-ly shit on a stick girl! So if he just showed up at the house, what the FUCK are you doing on the phone with me?”

“I need you to call me in like forty-five minutes pretending to be Mike saying he has to cancel on me tonight.”

“I don’t even want to know. OK, I’ll do it. Now go. Get you some of that.” And with that, Alice chuckled and ended the call. And I grinned my evil grin at myself in the mirror.

I quickly put on a tank top, conveniently forgetting my bra, and a jean skirt, conveniently forgetting my panties - oops, and headed back out to the living room. Edward was a resourceful one, already having mixed both of us a cocktail and made himself comfortable on my big, overstuffed couch.

“So what brings you back to my neck of the woods?” I asked as I plopped down on the couch, bringing my feet underneath me.

“I told you I’d come by and make sure you weren’t in a coma. And it just so happens, your neck of the woods borders my neck of the woods.” Oh shit, I totally forgot he said that. “But you never mentioned you had plans.” Bad Bella. Bad, bad Bella.

“Sorry ‘bout that. I totally forgot Mike and I had made arrangements to go out for drinks tonight.” Or did I have plans with Alice pretending to be Mike, pretending to be in town. I forget.

“So this Mike dude, is he your boyfriend?” he asked before taking a long pull off his vodka.

“Ha, no. Mike is definitely not my boyfriend. Not like he hasn’t tried. He’s just a guy I’ve known forever and he’s in town for a few weeks for work so we’ve been trying to get together to catch up.”

“So, do you have a boyfriend?”

Wow dude, way to get right down to business. I looked at up at him through my lashes and smiled. “Well, that’s a pretty personal question to ask a girl you only just met a few hours ago. Don’t you think?”

Edward shrugged and took another sip of his drink. He looked down at his lap, which made me look down at his lap and memories of earlier today on the beach came flooding back. Was it just a mirage I saw earlier? He shifted in his seat. Nope, not a mirage.

“What about you? Do you have a girlfriend? Since we seemed to have gotten to this stage in our relationship in light speed time. Or maybe you have a…. um… boyfriend, like your brother?”

“Definitely not. The Cullen family can only handle one queen and Emmett pretty much burst out of the closet when he was about 12, so I never had a chance,” he chuckled as looked out the window towards the beach. &quot;Ever since we moved in a few days ago, he’s been like a little kid, staying on the beach until sunset, playing in the sand. Jasper is his latest flavor of the month. If I’m not mistaken, this is his first “relationship” and he’s still really not too sure of himself.”

I laughed out loud. “I could kinda tell when they were holding hands. He wasn’t too sure about the public display of affection.” At least they weren’t engaging in PDA with themselves like I was earlier.

“You never answered my question,” Edward said in a more serious tone.

“Wha? Oh, right. I am currently not entertaining any one specific gentleman. Why? You want to submit your resume?” Oh Bella, you dirty, dirty whore. Stop toying with him.

Edward’s eyes darkened and a sinful smirk spread across his face. I got the sudden urge to run my hands over his stubble-covered jaw, and then grab his face and press it between my braless boobs. Down girl, down. Don’t scare the poor guy away so soon.

The sex drought was starting to fuck with my brain. Check that… the sex-with-a-man drought. I’ve spent plenty of nights fucking myself silly over the past few months. Ever since Jake and I had our famous falling out. Which is fine. I seem to know how to pleasure me better than he did anyway. It was always like a grope and poke amateur night with him. And to think I thought I couldn’t do better. I was better for fuck’s sake!

Edward continued to stare at me with those fuck me eyes and that blow me grin and I couldn’t take it anymore. “Why are you looking at me like I’m something to eat?”

“Because I’m hungry,” he said continuing to hold me in a stare that was starting to make me a little wet. And with no panties, this was dangerously close to getting messy. “And your nose is all swollen which makes me think of putting raw meat on it like they do on TV, which is making me hungry.”

I quickly closed my mouth which was minutes from not only giving him a piece of my mind for calling my nose big, but also spurting out the hundreds of dirty raw meat jokes rattling around in my sick brain. I’d like to eat his raw meat. Gah, Bella, stop!

Just as I was about to say something semi crude, my phone rang. Ah Alice, always so punctual. “Hold on a sec,” I said looking at the caller ID, “it’s Mike probably calling to tell me he’s running late as usual.”

I got up from the couch and wandered into the kitchen. No need in risking Edward being able to hear Alice on the other end. “Hey Mike. What’s the good word?” I paused for effect. “Oh no, really? Are you sure? You get here so seldom… Ok, well, sorry we won’t be able to hook up,&quot; another pause, &quot;I meant see each other you fucking asstard, not hook up! Ok, yup, safe travels. Later.”

When I turned around to head back to the living room, I nearly knocked Edward right over. He was standing right behind me. “Looks like you’re free tonight after all,” he said, grinning like a Cheshire cat.

“Looks like I am. So what do you propose? Did you have any food in your bag of tricks, or were you just trying to get me drunk?”

“I honestly didn’t think I’d have to get you drunk. Looked like you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself when I left you earlier. For a small person, you seem to have an incredibly high tolerance. I think you’re trying to get me drunk. And for the record, I have all the fixings for burgers in my bag of tricks. Point me to your grill and I&apos;ll cook you some meat you’ll never forget.”

Aaaaand I think I just heard my vagina whimper. He was putting a serious flirt on, but as horny as I was, I planned on making him work his ass off for some of this ass... okay, not really. I just hoped it didn’t backfire since I had an idea of what he was working with, Vinnie the Vibrator was not going to cut it tonight.

“I’m looking forward to eating your meat.” There I said it, bad Bella can’t stay locked away forever.

Edward’s eyes widened, and then without a second thought, he replied, “I don’t think all my meat will fit in your mouth.”

Jesus fucking Christ on a Christmas morning this was going to be a long fucking night. My legs were starting to feel weak. I needed to sit down. I pointed towards the back French doors that led to the deck overlooking the beach. “The grill is on the deck. I’ll come out and keep you company while you cook your meat.” I was still so flabbergasted by his last response I couldn’t even muster up a witty or dirty comeback. 
Edward fired up the grill and showed off his grill master flash skills while I sat quietly, still reeling from the meat-in-mouth comment. I needed to steer the conversation back to a harmless topic or neither one of us was going to eat meat - or at least those burgers. &quot;So where are you from, originally?&quot; I asked leaning back on the chaise.

&quot;Well, Emmett and I are from Seattle originally but we both went to school in Boston and fell in love with Maine after making a couple weekend road trips here so we decided to move here after graduation. Jasper is from somewhere in Texas. He went to school in Connecticut and honestly, I&apos;m not quite sure where he and Emmett met,&quot; Edward answered as he flipped the burgers. &quot;What about you? Are you from Maine originally?&quot;

I&apos;m sure he didn&apos;t notice my mouth drop open at the mention of Seattle. &quot;Um, well, I&apos;m from Forks,&quot; I answered, waiting to see if he recognized the name.

&quot;No fucking shit,&quot; he yelled as he nearly flipped the burger clear off the grill. &quot;How fucking ironic is that? My family used to camp in the Olympic National Park every summer. We&apos;d always go to Forks for supplies. That&apos;s hilarious!&quot; He turned back to the grill, still shaking his head in disbelief.

I didn&apos;t say anymore. I hated talking about Forks, and since I had left long ago, I never really thought of it as home anymore. &quot;Those burgers almost done? I&apos;m fucking starving!&quot; I said, trying to get him off yet another subject. Great, now there&apos;s just the subject of getting him off that I&apos;d like to get on soon. How fast can I stuff that burger into my pie hole?

&quot;I&apos;d say there just about done.&quot; Edward tossed the burgers onto the plate and shut off the propane. &quot;It&apos;s getting a bit chilly out here, maybe we should eat inside?&quot;

&quot;Yup, definitely. I love how this time of year it can be 85 degrees during the day here, and easily drop into the 50&apos;s by sunset.&quot; I chuckled as I led him into the kitchen and started tossing condiments onto the counter. After dressing our burgers, we went back to the living room to eat.

We sat silently as we both ravenously polished off our burgers. I felt much better with a full stomach but I wasn&apos;t quite out of the sex starved woods yet. I think I needed to up the ante a bit and see what old Eddie was all about... and what his intentions are for this evening. I got up from the couch to clear the dishes while Edward continued to sip his drink quietly. It was almost as if we were both trying to plot our next move. When I returned to the living room, it was obvious he was deep in thought.

&quot;So tough guy,&quot; I began, crossing my arms over my chest. &quot;You all were so brave today in that cold water... I&apos;ll be you $50 you don&apos;t have the balls to go in right now.&quot;

&quot;Oh and like you do?&quot; He inquired, raising his left eyebrow.

Oh it&apos;s on - no one gives me the bitch brow and lives to talk about it. &quot;Ah ya, I think I do. I&apos;ve lived her long enough to have grown a pretty hefty set of balls, Edward. I&apos;m used to the cold water.&quot;

&quot;What are the rules? Are we talking in full on up to the neck?&quot; Edward was starting to look a little nervous. I&apos;m sure not wanting to look like a giant pussy in front of me.

&quot;I&apos;d like to go easy on you since you&apos;re a newbie, but I&apos;m thinking you gotta dive in, wearing just your underwear. Don&apos;t think you&apos;re going to run home and throw on a wet suit or some shit like that!&quot; Oh Bella, you silly, silly slut. Looks like just the ploy to get a glimpse of his equipment.

&quot;You&apos;re on there Lady Balls.&quot; Lady balls? Oh Edward, I&apos;ll show you some lady balls.

I headed into the bathroom to grab some big, fluffy towels and remembered I wasn&apos;t actually wearing any undergarments so I quickly threw on a white lace bra and panty ensemble. Smart Bella, make him see what he has to look forward to should he play his cards right. We headed down to the water&apos;s edge, the moon brightly leading our way. It was definitely bright enough to ensure there would be no doubt what type of sword Edward was wielding.

We stood silently stripping down to our delicates when I glanced over at him to see he was wearing a nice pair of tight white boxer briefs. Oh dear, looky here... I&apos;m all wet and we haven&apos;t even made it into the water yet.

&quot;Ready when you are, chief,&quot; I announced, resting my hands firmly on my hips.

Edward looked scared so I took this as a sign that I had this bet in the bag. &quot;Let&apos;s do it, Lady Balls. I hope you have that crisp $50 at home waiting for me.&quot;

Aw fuck it. I took off in a sprint towards the water, high stepping it past the waves, and dove into the ice cold water. Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck, that was cold... but I needed to be cool, not give away how cold the water actually was. Instead, I calmly stood up, slicked my wet hair back out of my face and turned back towards the shoreline to see what was taking Edward so long.

He was still standing frozen in ankle deep water, staring at me, his mouth hanging open. Wow, he must be impressed with my cold water tolerance, I thought. But when I glanced down at myself, I realized that wasn&apos;t what he was staring at. Not only were my nipples so hard they could burst out of my bra at any second, I seemed to have completely lost my panties during my dive. Can you say exhibitionist?

&quot;Hey, quit your staring. Haven&apos;t you seen a fucking half naked woman before? And stop stalling you big pussy, and get your ass in this water.&quot; No reason to be embarrassed... he was going to see me completely naked before the night was through anyway.

As Edward cautiously made it through the waves, I felt around the water surrounding me for my poor, lost panties. Sadly, they were gone. Needing to speed up his progress, I began furiously splashing in his direction. My body was pretty much numb at this point so it didn&apos;t bother me too much. Edward stopped and looked at me, his green eyes going dark, and a devious grin spreading across his face.

The next thing I knew, he was barreling towards me like a crazy man, tackling me into the waves. As we emerged from the waves, I noticed Edward still had me in a bear hug and it was not lost on me that I had no fucking panties on. But why should that matter? I&apos;m sure in this cold ass water, his poor little pecker has found someplace to hide... right? But that was not the case. He continued to hold me close and I realized he was hard. Very hard and very large and very going to get lucky tonight.

&quot;Whoa, Edward, is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?&quot; Really? You thought I could let that go?

He shook his head. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t you like to know?&quot; He released me from the bear hug... unfortunately, and we finally made our way out of the water to our towels. I was freezing, and remembered I was naked from the waist down. I quickly wrapped myself in a towel feeling weirdly self-conscience all of the sudden. Or maybe it was hypothermia.

&quot;I&apos;m sorry, this may be forward, but I have to ask. What&apos;s with the wood in the freezing cold water? Are you a fucking superhero whose special power is immunity to the shrinkage?&quot; I stood there clutching my towel around my shivering body, waiting for his answer with bated breath.

&quot;Are you crazy? I honestly don&apos;t think a girl has ever noticed that before. But then again, I&apos;ve never hung out with a girl quite like you. You seem to just blurt out whatever&apos;s on your mind.&quot; Edward was skirting the question.

&quot;Dude, I spend my summer days watching fat tourist guys in Speedos come out of that freezing cold water without so much as even a hint of a fucking pecker in their pants. And now here you are, freezing cold water at night no less, and no sign of shrinkage. It makes no sense to me and I&apos;m an expert on the shrinky dinks.&quot;

Edward stepped closer to me and leaned down to whisper in my ear. &quot;Maybe you just have that effect on me.&quot;

If I had panties on, they&apos;d have spontaneously combusted. &quot;Maybe you&apos;d like to put the wood to work,&quot; I countered, breathlessly. He panted lightly. I bit my lip.

He moved closer to me so that our towel swathed bodies were just barely touching yet I could still feel his considerable cock touching my stomach. My gawd I wanted to drop to my knees right there on the wet sand, but I was freezing and needed to get back to the house. How can I get him back there without losing this tension? I need to get laid tonight... by a real live dude.

We stared at each other for what seemed like eternity. Edward reached up and put his hands on my shoulders, then slowly started rubbing his hands up and down my arms. &quot;You must be freezing,&quot; he said softly, trying to warm me with his hands. &quot;Maybe we should take this party back up to the house.&quot;

I nodded, not able to speak for fear of what my lack of brain-to-mouth filter might allow to slip out. We walked silently side by side back up to the house. I couldn&apos;t stop myself from shivering, even after getting inside.

&quot;I&apos;m going to take a quick shower to rinse off the salt and try to warm up a bit.&quot; I turned on my heel and headed into the bathroom. Once under the hot water, I slowly started to warm up. My hands and feet were so cold the heat of the water felt like needles on my skin. Only needing a few minutes to rinse and warm up, I shut the water off and grabbed a towel for my hair.

I slid the shower curtain to get out and gasped at what I saw. Edward stood outside the shower, stark naked and very ready for action. Once again, my mouth gaped open. Oh Bella, you keep that mouth hanging open like that, someone&apos;s going to shove a cock in it.

&quot;May I help you?&quot; I joked, reaching past him to grab another towel. I was so focused on his nakedness, I had completely forgotten about my own.

He snatched my hand before it reached its destination. &quot;Yes, I think you can,&quot; he smirked. That fucking smirk was going to be the death of me. &quot;I thought maybe I could jump in a rinse off as well.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sure, no problem.&quot; As I stepped out of the shower, he moved in front of me to block my exit.

&quot;I think I meant that I could jump in with you to rinse off,&quot; he breathed, leading me back into the already steamy shower.

For the millionth time that evening, I was speechless. I silently let him usher me back under the piping hot spray. I could only stare at how beautiful every part of him was and how much I wanted to trace the lines of his body with my tongue. My eyes capturing every detail of his chest and abs and... well... As if reading my mind, he gently lifted my chin up so my eyes met his.

&quot;Is it wrong that I&apos;ve been imagining this moment every since I met you with your bloodied face earlier today?&quot; He murmured, nearly unheard over the sound of the shower. But I heard him. And I shook my head, trying to find my words.

&quot;No, not wrong.&quot; I managed. &quot;Is it wrong I&apos;ve been dreaming of this moment non-stop for the past month?&quot; He would have no idea what I was talking about. And evidently he didn&apos;t care. He hesitantly brought his lips closer to mine, not sure what my reaction was going to be - even though I was standing in the shower naked with him. I didn&apos;t move. His mouth finally found mine in a soft, slow kiss that made my head spin. When he pulled away, it made me feel lost. This was not a feeling I was accustomed to having. At least not since Jake. And even he never had this effect on me.

I couldn&apos;t control myself any longer. I seized a handful of his hair and pulled him back to my lips as I crushed my naked body against his. He had ignited a fire inside me I thought had been permanently extinguished long ago. Our tongues struggling against each other, his hands frantically exploring every surface of my body.

This was so much better than the dream. Every one of my nerve endings was dancing with joy.

Edward moved his hands to either side of my face and pulled my lips from his. &quot;Bella,&quot; he whispered.

&quot;Shhhhh,&quot; I put my finger to his parted lips. &quot;Don&apos;t.&quot;

His eyes darkened, he panted softly. He said nothing, only pushing me towards the back wall of my shower. I couldn&apos;t think of anything but wrapping my legs around his waist, and I needed his mouth back on me immediately.

I pulled his face back to mine, grinding my pelvis into him. He reached down and roughly grabbed the back of one thigh, hitching it up around his waist. I could feel his hard cock teasing, pressing hard against my clit. I panted fast into his mouth as he continued to assault me with his tongue. The hand that wasn&apos;t holding my leg in place roughly massaged my breast. Sensing my anxiousness he released my boob and hoisted the other leg so I was finally where I longed to be. His cock now teasing my entrance.

Edward pulled away from my lips and buried his face between my tits. If I hadn&apos;t been leaning up against marble tile, I would have thrown my head back in ecstasy. Instead I continued to grind as much as I could from the position I was in. He continued to drive me harder into the wall, the tip of his monster cock working its way into my desperately wet pussy. I ravaged his hair with my hands as his mouth continued its plundering of my breasts. The stubble hurt so good.

&quot;Edward, please, now,&quot; I begged, the fire between my legs too much to bear any longer.

Without another word between us, he lowered me down and entered my aching vagina, slowly pumping as he gazed into my eyes which were threatening to roll back in my head at any minute. This was the first human pecker I&apos;ve had in me in a long time and I needed it to last... and last it did... through an entire tank of hot water.

As the water started to turn cold, I screamed out his name as we rode out our orgasms together. As I slumped against his shoulder, he carefully released my wobbly legs back down to the floor, but still held my swaying body in place.

He opened his mouth to say something when I heard someone banging on the front door like the place was on fire. &quot;Ignore it,&quot; he pleaded as he still stood in front of me, leaning against the shower wall, one hand on either side of my head.

&quot;Gladly,&quot; I replied as I pulled his face back down to me. But the banging wouldn&apos;t stop and now whoever was outside was frantically yelling my name.

&quot;Bella! Bellaaaaaaaa! Are you in there?&quot; The voice sounded vaguely familiar. I turned to duck under Edward&apos;s arm and out of the shower and I woke up, well actually, I nearly nap jerked myself clean off the couch.

I looked around confused, I was alone, face down, passed out on the couch in a big puddle of drool. What the fuck just happened? I surveyed the living room. The sun had completely set and it was now pitch dark. I got up to turn on the light and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror finding myself still clad in just my bath towel. Not to mention I had fallen asleep with wet hair which was now looking very Scissorhands-ish. And my nose... Oh, my nose. The bruising had started to spread under both eyes making me look like I just went a few rounds with Mike Tyson.

These fucking dreams had to stop. And now that I had actually met the man of my dreams, it looked to be getting worse. And then I heard the banging on the door again.

&quot;Bella, please, open the door. I need to know you&apos;re ok,&quot; the voice pleaded.

Oh well, there was really nothing I could do to my appearance right now to make this any better, so here goes nothing. I pulled the door open to find Edward, showered, dressed in jeans, a white t-shirt and flip flops, carrying a bag of groceries.

&quot;Jesus, it took you long enough to answer the door... ah, what have you been doing? Are you okay?&quot; He asked, obviously concerned by my disheveled appearance.

I couldn&apos;t fucking believe I dreamed the entire, erotic shower scene. My face was throbbing and my buzz had completely worn off which made me just want to sit on the floor and cry.

&quot;Um sorry, I guess I must have fallen asleep on the couch after my shower.&quot; I replied disappointedly.

&quot;I told you I was coming over to check up on you. I really didn&apos;t need for you to drink yourself into a black out and choke on your own vomit.&quot; Awww, he&apos;s like the sweetest guy ever.

&quot;Thanks dude, I appreciate it. Come on in... whacha got in the bag?&quot; I asked, trying to peek into it.

He pulled it away from me like a 6 year old. &quot;For you information, I brought over some burgers since I didn&apos;t think you had any plans to eat. So I thought I&apos;d cook you up some juicy meat.&quot;

Oh gawd, here we go again. I pinched myself to make sure I was really awake this time.

The End.

 Rob on the beach... yum! I need to dream this every night.

Day One: Gulfport and Biloxi

 

Photographs by Bobby Moon .

Reflections by Frank Brightwell.

Camera and lens rental from BorrowLenses.com .

 

Our first stop was in Gulfport where, around the corner from the BP Community Outreach and Claims office, was a festively decorated barbershop. The proprietor and self proclaimed “artist” was Linda, a New Jersey transplant by way of South Florida. Upon entering we were offered freshly baked raisin buns by Ms. Shirley. She was selling them for a local charity. In the shop, Linda was engaged in conversation with Mr. Anderson, Mr. Watson and Mr. Goodson. Numerous dead birds had been found on the sidewalks of downtown. All speculated that they were “fallin’ out the damn sky” because “God only knows what they been eatin’ poisoned out the water.” Ms. Felicia came into the shop and offered us freshly made stuffed boiled eggs… her recipe, “and I don’t use no yellas, only the whites. You know, them yella parts, well, they just ain’t good for ya.”

 

I asked Linda and her friends how the oil spill had impacted Gulfport. She struggled, she told us. Summer should be her busy season, and she has had little traffic. And this even with her charging $10 a cut, as Mr. Anderson was quick to point out. See, Tommy, the town barber for 45 years who died in the spring and from whom Linda bought the shop, well, he never charged more than $5. And sometimes he would charge only $3. And if he charged $3, you knew he was saving $2. Linda cursed the oil, not so much for its tainting the Gulfport shoreline, but because the fear that it had done so kept people away. “The restaurants, the hotels, the stores, and especially the poor fishermen, they’ll be hurtin’ for a long time,” she said.



 

 

Driving along the water’s edge between Gulfport and Biloxi, one is struck by what must be the last stretch of undeveloped waterfront property in the country. We found it curious that lot after lot of seemingly prime locations for beautiful homes, hotels and businesses lay barren. We learned that this was not an effective attempt at green space preservation, but rather the aftermath of Katrina. In this area water reached the second floor of buildings. Some floated away, their occupants never to seen again. Some simply—apparently—disintegrated by the force of the wind and water. The empty lots, their power lines and driveways waiting as if for a prom date, reminded us that this gentile stretch of openness was once home to hundreds of people.

 

We gazed at the Gulf of Mexico. Where was this oil rig that exploded? We could only see the simple and intoxicating beauty of the water and the waves and the sun. A solitary bloom ignited the starkness of the surrounding sands… the purity of nature reassured us that perhaps our worst fears were exaggerated. And then, as if to echo the words of Linda, the bright red “Danger” tape shouted that all was not as it seemed. Tracks in the sand took us to equipment and a sole recovery “worker” casting nets to capture the stray tar balls. A boom in the distance collected still more oil. The tall grasses behind the boom did not realize six months had passed.

 

A small shell resting on a mound of sand demonstrated nature’s perfection. But upon closer inspection, we became painfully aware that the perfection had been violated. The dark spirals on the shell were not its natural coloration. Glistening in the distance, as if a flint arrowhead ready to spark, lay a tar ball. And adjacent to it were numerous others, like gumballs waiting for quarters…the tar spoiled the perfection and the harmony and the lives of people like Linda and her friends.

In the distance of just a few dozen yards we encountered half a dozen decomposing catfish. A local fisherman passing by speculated that because the catfish are “bottom feeders,” they are likely ingesting toxic sediment along with their food. Even the numerous birds showed no interest in the fish, some of which were obviously only recently killed.

 

The reeds and grasses of the shore’s dunes danced in the twilight’s gentle breeze. Some of the plants painted intricate designs in the sand while nearby, birds’ claw prints spoke to us in hieroglyphics. And when the Gulf exhaled its tarnished breath, infected by black lung disease, the canvas was wiped clean once again. As its delicate beams illuminated the water, the moon reminded us that another day would cleanse.

 [details] [close] received 1 year ago  published 1 year ago  lang: en   The RLS is giving me hell. Ironically and illogically, it seems to be getting worse as I become more mobile. We&apos;ve just upped the dose of Requip, and hopefully that will improve things SOON, but in the meantime, I&apos;m taking more narcotics than my GP is happy with, and it&apos;s actually not knocking the RLS out very effectively anyway.

HULK SMASH.

I am also still in the Hell of the Unreceived Edit Letter, and while I am trying to make constructive use of my time (going through The Goblin Emperor again on my own recognizance to fix the things I know are wrong, getting mirrorthaw to poke more holes in my worldbuilding, etc.), it&apos;s hard to stay focused, especially when part of my brain is SCREAMING, &quot;Publish or perish! Publish or perish!&quot; and I can&apos;t seem to finish a short story to save my goddamn life.

So, it&apos;s the first line meme again, this time arranged by estimated closeness to completion, in hopes that it will help me organize this embarrassing plethora of unfinished stories into a list of manageable tasks.

Well, it&apos;s worth a try, anyway.

 
IN PRESS:
&quot;Ashes, Ashes&quot; at All Hallows 
&quot;Extract from &apos;Horror in Pierre Lucerne : Suburbia, Alienation, and the Rejection of Community&apos;&quot; at The Magazine of Speculative Poetry 
&quot;Why Do You Linger?&quot; at Subterranean 

[just to remind myself that they&apos;re out there]

IN SUBMISSION:
Yes! There is one story in submission at this time: &quot;Learning to See Dragons&quot; at Apex Magazine .

IN COLLABORATION:
 with matociquala : An Apprentice to Elves 
Tin laced her fingers together across her gravid belly and frowned along her nose at the feeble human child.
[Third wolf book.]

IN PROGRESS:
 Shadow Unit : &quot;Hope Is Stronger Than Love&quot; 
Everyone had had to bring a brown-bag lunch.

[This isn&apos;t part of the list proper, because it&apos;s bespoken. But I still have to finish it.]

 1. &quot;Hollywood and Vine: A Still Life with Wolves&quot; 
Wolves prowl the Sunset Strip. You can tell them by the way their eyes reflect the street lights. You don&apos;t get in their cars or follow them down alleys, no matter what they promise. You made that mistake once, and you know just how lucky you are that you came out alive, mostly in one piece, and not infected with anything worse than the clap.

Hollywood has taught you a whole new definition of &quot;lucky.&quot;

[This story is essentially finished, except for (a.) the part wherein I need my protagonist to actually protag, and (b.) my sneaking conviction that it&apos;s actually embarrassingly bad and therefore should not see the light of day. I need to finish rewriting the climax to give the poor bastard some agency, and then I need to send the fucker out, whether I think it&apos;s any good or not.]

 2.&quot;The Devil in Gaylord&apos;s Creek&quot; 
We&apos;d been hearing rumors about the Devil being in Gaylord&apos;s Creek for days before we got there.

[This story is finished, and has even been out in the marketplace, and I persist in liking it. I need to find a way to get more of the cool shit into the story rather than hiding it away like a squirrel for winter.]

 3. &quot;(Un)fallen&quot; 
The pain is intense, sharp, and localizes itself gradually, as Vij comes closer to consciousness, into a throbbing knot on the back of ser skull, just behind ser left ear. Se reaches to touch it, groans as that wakes a whole new set of pains through ser left shoulder and arm, and only then wonders why se is corporeal at all.

[I have a draft of this, but it doesn&apos;t work. Like Rwanda, the infrastructure&apos;s fucked.* I need to figure out how to make the action the characters take commensurate with the problem they face.]

 4. &quot;Coyote Gets His Own Back&quot; 
Luther shot the coyote bitch on Wednesday. She didn&apos;t make a sound, just fell ass over teakettle into the defile, blood blooming across her neck and chest. She was dead--there was no doubt about that, then or later.

[This is the story I cannot sell, because I think it does exactly what it&apos;s supposed to, and no editor on the planet agrees with me. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s anything to be done about that or not.]

 5. &quot;Imposters&quot; 
They were pulling out of the parking lot of St. Dymphna&apos;s Psychiatric Hospital when the radio crackled into life.

[This story, which is a Ghoul Hunters story, is also finished and also will not sell.]

 6. [untitled] 
The windship Pellucid heeled over, her sails filling as they caught the wind called the Mariah, one of the winds that blew so steadily across the Abandon that they had been mapped more than a century before: the Mariah, the Medusa, and the Mother of Angels, which had another name among windship crews.

[I have a finished draft at 9,600 words and the strong feeling that something is missing. Also the strong feeling that the story is embarrassingly bad and should not see the light of day. I seem to be suffering from that a lot lately. Note to self: getting dumped by your publisher and forced to change your name to get anyone to touch your pariah-like self is apparently very bad for the ego.

[Further note for the audience at home: there&apos;s a reason narcotics are commonly called downers.]

 7. Extract from &quot;&apos;I opened the book and read&apos;: Self-Reflexivity and Self-Reinvention in Hôtel Image &quot; 
Within the novel Hôtel Image is the nightclub Hôtel Image, &quot;dark, dubious, deviant&quot; (15), and within the nightclub Hôtel Image is the novel Hôtel Image , prosaically bound in pea-green cloth.

[This is a kind of companion piece to &quot;Extract from Pierre Lucerne ,&quot; which I successfully sold to The Magazine of Speculative Poetry . It&apos;s not a poem, but it&apos;s not quite anything else, either. Probably I need to see if MSP is interested, since they bought the first one.]

 8. [untitled] 
RECORD OF DISCOVERY OF FIVE (5) CORPSES

[No title, but most of a plot, and a huge technical problem in how to write the damn thing. Speaking of things that aren&apos;t quite poems.]

 9. &quot;The Hostage Crisis on the Derelict Mistral Freighter D35-692N-C, Queen of Liverpool &quot; 
The Mistral Freighter D35-692N-C, Queen of Liverpool , had been grounded for thirty years, since the successful implementation of Chen and Tiedemann&apos;s q-curve drive had made her and all her sisters obsolete.

[I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m ever going to figure out how to write this story. I have two drafts, both egregiously wrong, and no clue how to make it work. This seems to be what my brain thinks science fiction is for.]

 10. &quot;The Werewolf Laura Stiles&quot; 
Callum pushed back from his desk violently, as if physical distance could get him farther away from the collection of mistakes currently masquerading as the English 201 midterm.

[Finished draft, except (a.) it seems to think it&apos;s the first chapter of a novel, and (b.) the plot makes no sense of any kind. And (c.) again with the embarrassingly bad.]

 11. Thirdhop Scarp 
The current owner of Thirdhop Scarp claims that the name is a contraction of &quot;third hope,&quot; but this is etymologically dubious in the extreme; still improbable but far more likely is the local explanation: that if you fall off the escarpment, you reach the bottom in three hops.

[This is the novella that will not die.]

 12. The Marriage of True Minds 
Sanspiro Base is a company town all the way.

[Another novella. Also science fiction, plus a number of other things. And I&apos;m having trouble with voice, of all the stupid things to have trouble with.]

 13. &quot;Doc Holliday Makes a Deal&quot; 
I died on November 8, 1887. It was not a pleasant experience. Even less pleasant, however, was finding that death was not a permanent and irrevocable state of being in which a man could lie quiet and be eaten by worms as it pleased them. As it turned out, death was anything but.

[Shorthand here would be Doc Holliday, Demon Hunter. And I&apos;m stuck because I don&apos;t know what name the Devil&apos;s using.]

 14. &quot;The Tale of Two Dead Mice&quot; 
Once upon a time, there were two dead mice, white and small and sleek.

[Plot? Hello?]

 15. &quot;The Queen in Winter&quot; 
There were five queens in the creche. Beulah, Pauline, Camille, Thelma, and Katrina. Beulah was the favorite, and one night after the nurses had gone to bed, the others ganged up on her. There were only four queens after that.

[Ditto.]

 16. &quot;The Skyscrapers of Bianch&apos;Elen&quot; 
Long ago, in a world none of them can remember, the vampires were taught to dance.

[And ditto.]

 17. [untitled] 
The woman in my office had been dead for five days when I found her. The smell was unbearable, but the ghost was worse.

[And one more.]

 18. The Second Son 
On the twenty-fourth of April, Medraut dreamed of Loheris again.

[I know the mystery and the solution to the mystery. I just can&apos;t figure out how to write the actual scenes. Also, all the Eliot quotes are going to make this a right bastard to get permissions for, if I ever finish it anyway.]

 19. Cormorant Child 
With a shriek of protesting metal, the hatch opened, and Mule fell out of the palace-ship into the long grass of the Edrin Valley. He was trying to run before he made it to his feet.

[This is waiting (a.) for me to figure out the SFnal archaeology of the culture, and (b.) for a little more distance from The Goblin Emperor , because I really don&apos;t want to write ANOTHER book about the Problem of Kingship just at the moment.]

 20. Blue Lace Agate 
They hadn&apos;t caught the shoggoth larva smuggles yet, but the head of the BPI&apos;s southeast hub had other things on his mind: &quot;And, ah, how are you and Sharpton doing, Keller?&quot;

 21. &quot;Under Babylon&quot; 
Mick Sharpton&apos;s howl of outrage--&quot;oh fuck no!&quot;--was clearly audible in the junior agents&apos; office.

 22. &quot;Crossing Styx&quot; 
&quot;Think of it as a vacation,&quot; Jamie suggested. Mick&apos;s reply was physically impossible, but very creative.

 23. &quot;The Brides of Nyarlathotep&quot; 
The Renault case refused to break. Snapshots of the victims had gone up on the corkboard in the briefing room, one by one, and most of the agents in the Bureau of Paranormal Investigations&apos; southeast hub could recite their names by heart: Lydia Renault, age 27; Mary Anne Sumner, age 24; Dale Kelton, age 25; Joella Barber, age 24. And they were waiting, sick and helpless, for number five.

[Mick and Jamie are waiting very patiently for me to get my shit together and tell some stories about them. Sorry, guys.]

 24. Black Hart Circle 
There were four in the game. Deep play, deeper than the pockets of at least two of them. Lydia Nash might be as collected as a woman choosing a new hat, but Esme Collier and Kori Fletcher were out of their depth, and Fan Carpenter didn&apos;t look any too comfortable either.

[I need some external conflict, or at least something for the other characters to be doing.]

 25. &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; 
The terrible irony in Katharine Blood&apos;s name became apparent in her death.

 26. &quot;To Die for Moon light&quot;/&quot;The Moon Key&quot; 
I cut off her head before I buried her.
OR
Queen Titania was dead.

[No working on other Booth stories until &quot;Thirdhop Scarp&quot; is cleared out of the goddamn way.]

 27. &quot;The Bone Jesus&quot; 

[Not sure I&apos;ve got the right approach to this one, so original first line withdrawn.]

 28. &quot;The Kitsune&apos;s Tragedy&quot; 
My mother was kitsune. When I was born kitsune, too, she cursed the fates and slew the midwife and raised me as a daughter.

[I&apos;d love to figure out how to make this one work, but so far, no dice.]

 By Liz Colado 

 Regardless of who is the legal owner of the country&apos;s natural resources and in particular the mineral resources, the state has the right to regulate the process of their development and use. The state should act in the interests of society as a whole and of individual property owners, when their interests come into conflict with each other and when they need the help of state organs of power to reach compromises when their interests conflict. —Vladimir Putin (1)
 

   KGB IN OUR HOUSE   

 

 America is the place of hope and freedom for oppressed people around the world. They see how slaves were freed, women were given voting rights, and our disabled have been protected by law. These people were minorities which needed protection. We gave it to them. Americans overall are good people who err in judgment like anyone else. Today we are not even protecting ourselves and our children.
 

 In the United States today, every sector of our society has corruption within it: the clergy, teachers, police officers, political leaders, Wall Street, celebrities….You know this. Most affected by this are our children. They have gotten used to the idea of &apos;trust no one,&apos; &apos;get the other guy first,&apos; and everyone ‘does it.’ Those of us who are baby boomers and older have seen this moral decay spread. It&apos;s real.
 

 Recently, our moral decay has become atrocious. As the United States disintegrates, we are blaming each other, only further hurting ourselves. Cover ups are everywhere. While we are busy playing the blame game, foreign subversive elements have gained control over our society: politically, socially, and in business. They have even affected our government. The KGB has encouraged this—that’s their game—which has happened slowly over the course of decades, making the destruction of us appear as normal. But now, it is obvious to everyone that this time period is different. Time has seemed to speed up. The handwriting is on the wall, it’s obvious. But what the KGB does not know, is that the writing is not necessarily written in Russian. 

 Our folly with the KGB&apos;s invasion has been our own. We have oppressed fellow Americans, beginning with the Native Americans, African Americans, and continuing to immigrants: Italians, Poles, Catholics, the Irish, Gypsies, Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Jewish Americans, Latino Americans, and Arab Americans etc…. Each newcomer was seen as different, rather than as an essential addition to our collective culture. We have also institutionalized lepers, the retarded, the different and forced procedures on them. The U.S. government has tested weapons on its own people.  Women are still living without the respect which they deserve. Our troops, once seen abroad as defenders of truth and freedom for all, are now viewed as occupying forces which never leave. Sadly, we Americans collectively have not recognized that others are also human beings too.
 

 ALL people deserve respect.  It is difficult to understand someone else until one stands in his place, is born to his family, has suffered what he or she has suffered. People need compassion, not prejudice. Until we as Americans open our minds to this concept, we will continue to fall prey to the subversive influence of lies.  
 

 We have subjugated our minds by giving control of ourselves over to others—government, media , religions, and are now living in denial of what is truth while others control what we hear, read, and see. LIES. That is the ultimate goal of the KGB --mind control of the U.S. population. With control, they have access to us, our knowledge, and our wealth.  The world is flat, to fight us would trigger a nuclear war or the devastation of a biological weapon--which also would affect Mother Russia. The Russian population itself is dwindling. They are afraid of outside influence and encroachment.  

 The Russians possess a fearful collective memory about a Mongolian incursion and forced colonization upon themselves, which instilled an obsession with national security remaining with them today. Interestingly, writer Peter Zeihan (Stratfor) writes, Russians are “obsessed with national security…..Many Russians view today’s steady NATO and EU expansions into the former Soviet territories through this prism, as simply the most recent incarnation of the Mongol terror.” In other words, the Russians have learned from the Mongols and instilled it within. 

 As a result, they have gone on the offensive against what they perceive as the enemy--the unwalled minds of the Americans. That&apos;s the truth. It&apos;s common sense.  

 The KGB historically has taken advantage of these polarizing situations, even previously within the United States.  As a few from the Russian government (specifically Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev) seek to control an enemy (the United States) through influential subversion and infiltration, grasping at America’s wealth (energy), our people look the other way, in denial. We are still in shock about losing the vacation condo we bought on extended credit! Recently, even Russian spies were permitted to leave the United States, in an exchange. The KGB is laughing it up back home--flaunting &apos;Anna Chapman&apos; in our faces on Facebook. The Gulf oil disaster saw a cover up. ANWR -- our Alaskan oil reserves are in danger of being shut down by the FSW--The blame is falling to the Obama administration.  The list goes on and on. 

 We are being squeezed from every side by KGB influence.  
 

 Americans choose to look the other way as banks foreclose, our federal government is pushing us deeper and deeper into debt by dumping our money into stimuluses which are a waste. American assets have been sold off to foreign countries. American companies are &apos;encouraged&apos; to take their business overseas . This is being done purposely and deceptively. The KGB wishes to weaken us. Their arms are long, and their pockets accessible to those who can be bribed. The polarization within the political parties is a distraction from what’s really happening. 

 The control of the United States and its people--legally, through fear, through control of health care, through control of income, through control of the government, gives the KGB control over our energy. Americans, like so many other countries need energy. For too long, we have agreed to allow the gas and oil industry to regulate our lives. We have spoken about the need for new renewable energy resource development. Nothing&apos;s happened. We&apos;ve suggested that our own resources be pulled from our own land, we&apos;re being bullied and scared into not doing so. This is obvious in the Gulf and now in ANWR (Alaska).  

 Who will get control of these resources? Whoever is in control of the United States. I would suggest that the KGB is now in play. 

 The Arctic Shelf is currently an area of energy resources which is being disputed by major countries: United States (Alaska), Russia, Denmark (Greenland), Canada, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The U.S. Geological Survey states that there is a vast wealth of &apos;untapped oil and natural gas&apos; beneath the surface. Approximately three times more gas than oil lies in the Russian Arctic. The wealth of previously inaccessible energy reserves (now beginning to be accessible because of a thinning polar ice cap), is valued at approximately $90 billion dollars. Canada, the United States, Denmark, and Norway are all NATO members. 

 In October, 2009, a NATO Commander said that &quot;Competition for resources in the Arctic Circle could provoke conflict between Russia and NATO.&quot; 

 Tai Adelaja writes, &quot;Russia has long sought to claim rights to more than 1 million square kilometres of extra territory in the Arctic, stretching from its current border in the Arctic Sea all the way to the pole.&quot; Recently, &quot;Russia signed a treaty with Norway, ending a 40-year dispute over their maritime borders in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. 

 Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a coastal nation can claim exclusive economic rights to natural resources on or beneath the sea floor up to 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) beyond their land territory. But if the continental shelf extends beyond that distance, the country must provide evidence to a UN commission which will then make recommendations about establishing an outer limit.&quot; 

 As each country gathers evidence of what it &apos;owns,&apos; the Russians and the Canadians have already decided that the United Nations will rule on their own discrepancy--the Lomonosov Ridge--setting a precedent for UN rulings on energy ownership. (2,3) 

 &quot;Arctic explorer Artur Chilingarov, a special presidential envoy for international cooperation in the Arctic and Antarctic, tried hard to calm nerves about the real or imagined Russian threat in the region. Countries bordering the Arctic region, Chilingarov said, must find solutions to all future problems in the region only through negotiation.&quot; (4) 

 Negotiation? Americans....this is another KGB lie. Artur Chilingarov, a Russian polar explorer, has also said, &quot;The Arctic is Russian. We must prove the North Pole is an extension of the Russian landmass.&quot; Canadians, wake up too! Chilingarov is beginning with the Lomonosov Ridge. It is only in 2010 that Chilingarov adds that scientific evidence and international law with UN Convention Law of the Sea should decide ownership of the Arctic Circle. 

 &quot;Russia has launched a drifting polar research centre on an ice-floe a thousand kilometres north of the Arctic circle....Expedition head Arthur Chilingarov said: &apos;We need to prove with the help of science that Russia is entitled to claim an enlarged external border. It is one of the functions of the station to define the limits of the Russian continental shelf.&apos;” ( EuroNews/10/16/2010 )
 

 Though the United States recognizes and honors almost all the provisions of the treaty, UN Convention Law of the Sea, it has not ratified it. &quot;For practical purposes, there is no pressing need to ratify it that outweighs the negatives of the remaining provisions.&quot; (5) 

 There are negatives and positives to ratification, with high level Americans sitting on both sides of the issue.  

 &quot;Like its predecessors, the Obama Administration, in the interest of promoting U.S. diplomacy, has expressed its intention to accede to the UN Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS) and to submit it for SFRC review sometime during 2009.&quot; (6) 

 &quot;On January 13, 2009, speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing as nominee for United States Secretary of State, Senator Hillary Clinton said that ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty would be a priority for her.&quot; (7)
 

&quot; On May 15, 2007, United States President George W. Bush announced that he had urged the Senate to approve the UNCLOS.&quot; (8)
 

 Also from 2007, &quot;The Russian parliament is refusing to ratify an agreement with the US over the Bering Sea.&quot; (9) 

 In 2007 the Russians placed their flag on the Arctic Sea floor.  

 &quot;Russians account for half of the Arctic&apos;s population and the most populous towns above the Arctic Circle lie in Russia, according to the Russian Geographical Society. 

 Russia&apos;s Arctic sector, inhabited by 1.5 percent of the country&apos;s population, accounts for 11 percent of its GDP and 22 percent of its exports.&quot; (10) The Russians are building their case for ownership. 

 The Russians are securing themselves on all sides to take the reserves in the Arctic Circle--by influencing law. You&apos;ll see that this has not been a short term plan, the Russian government has been working toward this goal slowly over the period of many years--possibly even decades, as that is their modus operandi. 

 During all of this, we are still fighting over ANWR in Alaska. The U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife has decided that it wishes to conduct wildlife reviews of the area this winter. 
 

 &quot;This is a blatant political move by the administration and clearly violates the promise of no more administrative wilderness designations in Alaska,&quot; states Lisa Murkowski, member of the Energy and Resources Committee. 

 In a statement Murkowski said, “It&apos;s a proposed waste of the oil and natural gas resources that belong to all Americans.&quot;

&quot;The Department of Fish and Wildlife stresses it only would make recommendations to the president and congress and it would have to vote for any changes in wildlife designation, but Murkowski said the announcement today constitutes a broken promise under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or ANILCA.&quot; (11)
 

 Each day we are bombarded with rights and wrongs. The media , a 24-hour cycle of ‘news’ plays a large role in this perpetuation of doubt. They are only reporters though—their truth is not necessarily the truth. In fact, even now, their role is to be used as ones who help to polarize the country: red and blue, left and right, conservative and liberal, black and white, Muslim and Christian, gay and straight, etc... We have never been so divided. There is a purpose to this madness: chaos, fear, separation, isolation.  

 This bickering and fighting is only hurting us further, as indicated with the ANWR predicament. We are isolating ourselves into a lack of energy resources instead of coming together for a common good, working toward one goal: a clean Earth, which will benefit everyone. The Russians do not want us to go to green energy. They&apos;d prefer that we stick with gas and oil while they control the supply, and ultimately us.
 

 In addition, it’s been said that Vladimir Putin is happy about the rising cost of oil while the United States is not. 

 Another key point, Alexei Miller, CEO of Russia&apos;s Gazprom has “attacked” European plans for a revolution in green energy . He has called the elimination of “carbon emissions …through the widespread adoption of renewable energy as science fiction.” He has also called the “development of unconventional shale gas resources in the United States,” a myth. Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe’s gas, has been hit hard by falling global prices for the fuel, which have been caused by the growth in shale gas supplies from the United States.(12) 

 The energy supply is crucial to Russia’s economic well being and to its security. Control of energy is control of enemies, as shown in Russia’s control of energy supplies to outlying buffer countries and to Europe. 

 Ultimately, being Americans, we will pull together during a time of crisis. NOW is that time.  That’s what occurred right after 9/11. Remember the flags flying on the cars? To speak against going to war was practically treason. Neighbors spoke angrily to anyone who was against the war in Iraq after Afghanistan had already been bombed. The media helped support that war.  Like Romans in the Coliseum, we watched as our country bombed another, killing women and children. But now, we say, was that the right thing to do? Where are the weapons of mass destruction? How many of our sons and daughters have been killed, maimed or mentally destroyed in service to America?  

 And common sense says, “Where is Osama Bin Laden anyway?” We went to the moon , to the bottom of the ocean, found Saddam Hussein using psi spies, but Osama Bin Laden remains at large?  

 It is expected based on our past performance of 9/11 events, that once again we will rally together during a time of crisis. That day is fast approaching. The media will be used for this purpose.  Remember 9/11 and how it affected the world globally? Panic was created—mainly due to the media’s prolonged attention and lack of initial accuracy. Guesses were even made about who had perpetrated the events without proper investigation. 

 Horrifying images were shown over and over, terrifying the public as people of many faiths and races died that day. We assumed that the entire U.S. was under attack.  The KGB knows all of this.  

 Even former KGB agent Yuri Bezmenov has spoken openly about KGB tactics spanning decades. (See video above.) How much more visible can this KGB plan be? 
 

 Americans! Open your eyes! You are still at war—a quiet war of mind control which will result in the slavery of your children for the purpose of controlling the world’s energy. Soon, they will push even more fear upon you--the fear of an alien invasion.  This is a HOAX.  These &apos;aliens&apos; are only imposters with an agenda.  

 As the KGB believes that they control America with separation and fear, they will steal our natural resources, benefitting only the few in the crony listing at the Kremlin. Even Mikhail Gorbachev has spoken about the open unrest of the Russian people with their own government. The few seek to control the masses.
 

 We both need peace. 

 The way out:
 

 We must clean out our own house, expunging the remnants of any subversive KGB agents and their sympathizers. 

 Americans must unite together for the better good of ALL—not just the wealthy, not just the poor, not just the minorities, not just the majority, not just the Christians, the Jews, nor the Muslims. We are ALL people who have arrived here from the same Creator. And it is to Him we will return.  

 Other countries have fallen to the KGB. They quietly travel the world gathering information, bribing others, creating issues resulting in the breaking of laws, for the sake of control. Their noose is tightening. For them, the handwriting on the wall reads, “ Russia Rises Again .” However, God has said that His people will not live in servitude to others. God is the way out. 

 With collective inclusiveness of people as human beings comes respect, integrity, mutual understanding, working together for the highest good of all. That is what we have in common: God. In this way, bribery will not work. The KGB will become ineffective in influence. One will not stand against the many united for the common good. Americans—you know this. Return to your history books. 

 God is also God of the Russian people, who too, just wish to live and get out from the dictatorship of Putin and Medvedev. The handwriting is on the wall; it reads, “Look around you—I AM HERE.”

 Olatunde Osunsanmi , who directed Milla Jovovich in &apos; The Fourth Kind, &apos; is slated to do &apos; Dark Moon &apos; as his next vehicle for Warner Bros. He also wrote the script.

The Hollywood Reporter states the film takes on the idea that manned moon missions did not stop with Apollo 17 and follows a black ops post-Apollo mission sent to the moon to explore previously classified discoveries and its unintended and disturbing consequences.

&apos; Moon &apos; falls into the burgeoning genre of &quot;found footage movies,&quot; which are purported to be reels or tapes or files found after the person operating the camera expired.

Osunsanmi is also attached to direct &apos; The Commuter &apos; for Gold Circle, and adapted &apos; The Orphanage &apos; (based on the novel by Robert Buettner) for Davis Entertainment.

Prior to &apos;The Fourth Kind,&apos; he worked as an assistant to director Joe Carnahan during the production of &apos;Smoking Aces .&apos;

 Immortal Analysis: An Opinion on TNA&apos;s New Heel Faction Storyline 
 [ New England Patriots , Sports , Fantasy Football ] ( Bleacher Report - Front Page )
On October 10, 2010, TNA held their mega-event of the year, Bound For Glory. Usually, the event starts the new main storyline of the promotion just like Wrestlemania does for WWE. In the main event of the evening, for the TNA World Championship, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan helped Jeff Hardy win the championship. This all led to the revelation that the &quot;They&quot; the monster, Abyss, was speaking of for the last few months in promos was, in fact, a group comprised of Hogan, Bischoff and Jeff J ...

 On October 10, 2010, TNA held their mega-event of the year, Bound For Glory. Usually, the event starts the new main storyline of the promotion just like Wrestlemania does for WWE. In the main event of the evening, for the TNA World Championship, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan helped Jeff Hardy win the championship.

This all led to the revelation that the &quot;They&quot; the monster, Abyss, was speaking of for the last few months in promos was, in fact, a group comprised of Hogan, Bischoff and Jeff Jarrett. The image left in viewers brains at the end of the night was trash being pelted at Hogan, Bischoff, Jarrett, Abyss and new TNA World Champion, Jeff Hardy as they cheer their actions.

It left us questioning what would happen next. What will Sting, Kevin Nash and Pope do, since they were the good guys the whole time? How does Dixie Carter feel? How pissed is Samoa Joe? What will RVD do? Will EV2 get in on this? With Fourtune around, is their room for They? Isn&apos;t Abyss fired? And what about Angle and Anderson?

The next episode of Impact helped answered some questions:

The new group is named Immortal. And instead of signing Abyss&apos;s release, Dixie signed over TNA to Hogan.

Talk about not reading stuff before signing it. So now, Hogan and Bischoff are in control. Jarrett gets power again too. Abyss is their destructive force, and all his actions were controlled, especially his attack on RVD, which was made by Jeff Hardy.
 
Hardy, now the Antichrist of Wrestling, sold in and doesn&apos;t care about his fans. He was tired of destroying his body for people who don&apos;t care about him. Then, Fourtune comes out and announces their alliance with Immortal, forming the New Regime of TNA.

They kick Dixie out the arena and in the end take full control. Sting and Nash say I told you so and leave, while Pope, Joe, Angle, RVD and Anderson are left beaten up.

TNA seems to always shift from one mega heel group to the next: S.E.X., Planet Jarrett, Angle Alliance, Christian Coalition, Main Event Mafia, Fourtune and now Immortal. It&apos;s the overused storyline of the mega heel group taking over, but this one never works since it usually depends on the superstars involved (wrestlers are always leaving), so the question is, can TNA do this right this time?

I will give them points on lead-up and Jeff actually serving as a good heel in the two promos he did. The next few weeks are crucial in getting this angle over properly. So, expect the two sides to go at it, Immortal vs. Dixie with the world title held up in the middle. But, I think for TNA to really help this one, they need one thing: a hero.

Now, some may say RVD is the hero because all during his reign, he was. True, RVD is the top face, but I&apos;m not so sure if he will end up being the hero of this story.
 
The hero will be that one man to go through hell the next few months and then finally get the TNA belt back into the hands of the good side. This guy is truly needed to end things instead of turning a group against each other or causing guys to just leave TNA. I think the blurred lines of the Attitude Era are what caused WWE and TNA to forget about this.

In the end, what is successful is the classic struggle between good and evil. Stone Cold was the everyman hero, The Rock was the cocky hero and even Sting was your dark, but bad-ass hero.

With each man, they all went through the proper struggles that led to them gaining the top spot and having the fans behind them all the way. So, let&apos;s break down potentials:

 

- Rob Van Dam : Of course, TNA seems to really love RVD as the top face. Ever since he came into TNA, he has been near the top. Even with his world title win, TNA obviously trusted him to head up the company and be its guy.

RVD could, in the end, fight hard and lead TNA to get it back to Dixie. I think he could work, but despite his awesomeness, I just think RVD is dry promo-wise, and I think it again is too obvious.

He will be one of the captains and help lead TNA to victory, but he&apos;s not the future champion to really stop Immortal. I also think WWE could use RVD more.
 
- Mr. Anderson : His big world title win is coming. To be honest, I had him pegged for the win at Bound For Glory in heel fashion but was caught off guard.

Anderson and his character are doing way better in TNA with fewer restrictions. The fans love being known as Anderson&apos;s A**holes. Its catchy. Though with this storyline, I think Anderson and Styles will feud over the TV Belt. Anderson will finally win a world title, but he is not ready to be a long-run, top-face world champ. Now, top heel could work, but he isn&apos;t a main event face.

- Samoa Joe : In my opinion, this guy can carry a show and, as always, is the wild card for the big faction feuds that TNA has. However, after the ordeal with Jarrett, Joe doesn&apos;t want to work with anyone anymore, so I can&apos;t really tell you how they will pull him. But, they will.

His reign was honestly too short and he needs another. Maybe politics holds him back, but everything else screams top guy. Not happening sadly.

- The Pope : Another person who was done wrong in WWE and is the right fit for TNA. Becoming the first black TNA World Champion could really help solidify his spot, but again, I doubt it. He will be a key player, but not the lead.

- Kurt Angle : Nope, sorry, folks. Love him to death, but I expect him to finish a little more with TNA and then retire in WWE. His feud will be with Jarrett and not really Immortal.
 
- Sting : I think he has truly been misused. The lead up is good, but really, Sting has to pass the torch and help a new guy truly become the next big hero in wrestling. TNA, I think, has lost their chance with that, because Sting&apos;s body is worn.

He has been dealing with shoulder issues for a while, and I expect to see him hang it up for good soon. They could work quickly and get him as a mentor, but I don&apos;t know. Either way, don&apos;t expect him as the hero.

- Jay Lethal : God, this kid is destined to be big. You would think after his feud with Flair, he would be ready for main event, but he is back in the X Division. It should be rebuilt, but it hinders Jay again.

Who knows? He could drop the belt again and finally move up and beat Jeff for TNA, but the X division does need him.

- Hernandez : Where the hell is this guy? I thought after his feud with Morgan he would move up, but he is in Mexico. This is good, but he is slowly losing his stake in TNA. Momentum can die fast if you don&apos;t capitalize, and he had it.

- Matt Hardy : WWE finally released him, so it&apos;s safe to say I expect him within TNA once the 90 days are up.

I can already think of the scenario. Months later, after another title defense, Jeff is on top, when all of a sudden, Matt Hardy runs in and attacks his brother. They feud over the belt and how Jeff turned his back on his fans. The rest of Team TNA don&apos;t trust Matt at first, but realize he is fighting to get his brother back.
 
Honestly, this could work, the problem lies with Matt, though. When giving the big push, he always seems to fail. I did like his reign as ECW Champion, though. They built him well, but failed on the heel turn, not to mention he is injury prone a bit and not as fast as he once was.

The TNA schedule might work for him, though. And maybe a heel Jeff and face Matt feud can work better over a world championship.

 

Now, you may ask me, &quot;What was the point, then? Who could be the hero TNA needs?&quot;

Well, this is a rough one. There are high chances Matt could be it because he is over like crazy in wrestling, just like Jeff and Van Dam. TNA is going to push him to the moon to rub it in WWE&apos;s face, which could work, but sadly we&apos;re back to where we have the problem: no focus on homegrown.

I&apos;m talking someone who truly established themselves without any form of WWE or other big-time connection. I mean, in some cases, I&apos;ll let it slide because TNA has helped give guys true opportunities and actually helped them more (Anderson, Pope, Abdul Bashir, Shannon Moore, Matt Morgan), but for a hero of TNA, he needs to truly come from TNA. So, I&apos;m split between two choices with Matt being the third option:

 
 
 - A New Person : Now, I&apos;m talking about someone who just comes out of nowhere and gets the push of a lifetime. I think there hasn&apos;t been a classic rookie-to-main eventer storyline in a while and it takes a gem of a wrestler to do it. They have to have the total package and never been shown on main television. This guy can become the real Mr. TNA because he will be, truly, a homegrown TNA superstar.

This one is very far-fetched and seemingly impossible, but a great wrestler who gets a massive push is missing, and he can become the hero and help TNA.

- Fourtune, Specifically AJ Styles : Honestly, he is the guy. When you think TNA, you think AJ.

I think with the whole Hogan Regime, they wanted AJ and Flair to align and make Fourtune from the jump. The idea, on paper, could have worked well, but the fact they took the world title off of AJ really holds it back, not to mention Flair&apos;s obsession with being heel. Flair should understand that no matter what he does, the fans love him and will love him.

Fourtune could work as the top face group and saviors of TNA because it is comprised of all TNA homegrown talent. Each man is famous because of TNA, even Matt Morgan, who is barely remembered as a former WWE talent.

But the main fact is, AJ was not meant to be a heel, the guy has always been the hero and exhibits the total package. He has been involved in some of the most epic matches and rivalries, and he&apos;s been there since the beginning.
 
 

So, there&apos;s no better person to save the day than the man that is TNA. And we have never gotten a proper Hardy vs. AJ feud, not to mention the heel group is too big. Too many egos means it will not end well. What better way to get a monster payoff than have Immortal vs. Fourtune and AJ Styles vs. Jeff Hardy for the TNA World Championship?

The way it could all pan out could be so simple. Fourtune becomes jealous of Immortal taking all the attention. Like always, old guys come into TNA and steal the attention away from the real TNA talents.

Flair tells his boys to fall in line. Finally sick of it, AJ tries to attack Jeff, and so, the rest of Immortal tries to attack him back. Flair orders the rest of Fourtune to also join in and beat up AJ, but they will stay on AJ&apos;s side and turn on Immortal, though Morgan and Williams might stay with Immortal.

So, this sets the tone for the transition. EV2 and Fourtune work out their differences and join Team TNA. Sting takes over the mentor role, so you can have a bonus Sting vs. Flair, Hogan and Bischoff feud for you nostalgia fans out there. Dixie joins in too, and after many other moments, it finally leads to Dixie regaining TNA ownership and AJ Styles regaining the TNA World Championship, making him an Immortal.

This feud could be the one that creates the balance, the one that finally sets TNA forward as &quot;the competition.&quot; You have all these old wrestlers come in and take over their way, but the trust that the company has in itself is what wins in the end, the trust they have in their own talents, like AJ or Kaz or Beer Money.
 
These are the guys that are truly TNA. This can show why TNA can win the war for supremacy. They believe in theirselves and have a true hero of their own.

Now, tell me that doesn&apos;t sound awesome. This storyline can go many different ways, and I expect it to, knowing TNA&apos;s track record, but I can hope.

 Tell us a bit about yourself.
 

Hello there, I&apos;m Julia and my partner&apos;s name is John. We&apos;re two misplaced oddballs living amongst the cornfields of rural Illinois. We live in a haunted 1920s farmhouse with low ceilings and floors so slanted that every morning we roll out of bed and then slide downhill to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. We share our home with a quirky, clown-faced pit bull, a cantankerous old beagle, and a ghost named Earl. Our house is nestled back in the woods on six acres, where we share our habitat with a menagerie of wildlife such as fox, deer, raccoon, opossum, turkey and the occasional wayward drunk hunter.

Besides being collectors and vendors of vintage oddities, I&apos;m an artist and John is a draftsman. We&apos;re both dreaming of the time when we&apos;ll be able to pack everything we own into two suitcases and live a life that is more nomadic. We haven&apos;t yet decided whether we want to travel by car with an airstream in tow or by houseboat and live as river rats. We just think that there&apos;s too much to see and do out there to be tethered to one spot for too long.

 Apart from creating things, what do you do? 

John sets up pyrotechnics or demonstrates black smithing for various events in the Chicagoland area. I tinker around with building automata. When things get too quiet around here, I make the dogs howl with my painfully awful cello playing. We both enjoy biking, walking the dogs, working in the veggie garden, staying in and watching old movies, going to silent film screenings, road trips and going out of the way for quirky roadside attractions, rummaging through flea markets, spending half of the day in a bookstore, packing a lunch, loading the dogs into the car, and heading out to the beach.

 

 What first made you want to become an artist? 

While looking through a book about surrealism when I was a child, my attention was captivated by images of shoes transforming into feet, fur-covered dishware and giant boulders suspended in mid air. The element of surprise, the playfulness and the dream-like landscapes enchanted me, and I knew that I wanted to somehow play within that realm. So it wasn&apos;t long before the crayons and the coloring books were pushed aside for pastels, paints and sketchpads.

 Please describe your creative process. 

I&apos;m more of a night owl than a morning person, so I&apos;m more creative from early afternoon until about 1 or 2 in the morning. I work mostly with oils, ink and clay, but I also like to experiment with different materials. Sometimes I see the finished piece in my head before I even put a pencil to paper. Other times, I start without any preconceived ideas and I work in the moment, a sort of stream of consciousness style, so to speak. I enjoy working that way the most — it&apos;s more expressive, playful, and there&apos;s always an element of surprise because I never know what I&apos;ll end up with. I&apos;ll either work obsessively on one project until I feel it&apos;s finished, or I&apos;ll have several projects in different stages of progress spread throughout the studio.

 What handmade possession do you most cherish? 

Julia: A scarf crocheted by my sister, and an old oil painting of a landscape that reminds me of Mount Desert Island, one of my favorite summer getaways.

John: A 19th century trunk with hand-forged iron hardware.

 What advice would you give to artists who are new to Etsy? 

Find ways to distinguish your shop from the rest. Unique, well-crafted items, good photos with interesting compositions, catchy titles and fun and informative descriptions are some ways to bring attention to your shop. Look at your listing from a customer&apos;s point of view: Is the photo eye-catching? Does the title pique your interest? If you saw your listing as a customer, would you want to check it out? Even though you know that your item is fabulous, your potential customers have only your photos and descriptions to judge by, so make them interesting, informative and accurate representations.

 

 What are your favorite features on Etsy? What new features would you like to see? 

There are a lot of features that I like, but the ones that I can think of right now are: the convo system, the order history for each customer on the orders page, being able to heart shops and items, and the shipping profile on the selling info page (saves me a bit of time when listing).

I would like to see a tag profile that is similar to the shipping profile when listing. I&apos;m frequently using the same tags over and over, so it would save time to just click on a saved tag profile instead of typing in every tag. I&apos;d also like to be able to edit expired listings before I relist. And I&apos;d like to see a category for photographs in the vintage section with subcategories such as tintypes, cabinet cards, and stereoviews.

 How do you promote your work? 

Promotion is not my strength, but recently I started posting photos on Flickr. Other ways that I try to promote the shop are by having interesting photos and listing at different times throughout the day.

 In ten years, where would you like to be? 

Julia: Well, if we&apos;re not moving around, I&apos;d like to be living near the coast in an old house with tall ceilings, creaky but level floors, a room for Earl, and enough land for a garden or two — still creating art, collecting and selling vintage photographs, and maybe, hopefully, playing the cello well enough not to make the dogs howl.

John: Alive, healthy and eating pie.

A Poem for the Innocents A killing moon peeks through leaves of trumpet trees in full bloom for Lent, their barks crisscrossed by wild strokes of a machete when my son tried to help me weed our garden, overrun with dandelions, branches, leaves, a bounty of seed and thorns, side by side, under clusters of suns bursting through the branches. Shadows flicker across the wall upstairs, over Buzz Lightyear&amp;#8217;s grin, Mr. Potato Head&amp;#8217;s sigh, and under a map dotted with cities that fill his dreams. What promises will I make when I climb the stairs before he falls asleep to the noise of the television with cluster bombs blooming in the sky over Baghdad? What comfort can I give him as I draw the sheets over his shoulders, kiss his forehead, when he worries that if he closes his eyes, his Aunt Batsheva, half a world away, will not rise from her bed in Gan Yavne, thirty-seven miles west of Ramah where Rachel wept for her children and refused to be comforted. The map over his bed now frightens him, and I cannot convince him, despite the miles and miles of oceans and deserts, that the machete under his bed will not make him safer, any more than the sacrifice of innocents will save us, for he knows, he knows, somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates, a wave of steel races toward Babylon.

But when night struts along Biscayne with the rumble of reggae in his stride, tabaco and mojitos on his breath, desire tight around his waist, she will lead him down the causeway into cooling waters of the bay, daily cares sliding off their flesh, and her dark laughter, like waves, lapping the sides of the Rickenbacker.

Near the roundabout, our car joins a line of holiday traffic heading toward the airport, smell of the dead harbour clinging to my body, and a man, armed with a rake and machete, clears debris from the embankments, branches that block signs for travellers like me who have forgotten which side of the road leads home. from Dub Wise (Peepal Tree Press, 2010) Order Dub Wise.

 Making women&apos;s opposition visible to NATO, Cynthia Cockburn

In April 2009 NATO celebrated its 60th birthday with a meeting of Heads of State in Strasbourg. Several thousand women and men from antimilitarist movements of France, Germany, the UK and other NATO countries flooded into the city to picket the Summit and protest against NATO’s continued existence and its ever-more threatening policies. Among those present in Strasbourg that weekend were a group of around forty women responding to a call put out through Women in Black against War , the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom and the German association Women and Life on Earth e.V . We organized a workshop in Strasbourg on ‘the feminist case against NATO’ and participated in the rally and demonstration with a silent women’s vigil, with banners in several languages.

In our home countries, however, the events of the NATO Summit passed without attracting much attention, even in our movement. In Strasbourg we were struggling to make women visible to NATO. But, conversely, perhaps NATO was insufficiently visible to women? NATO can seem an abstract and distant entity. When it comes to lobbying, campaigning and action on the street, we find it easier to mobilize popular opinion against national militarization in our member states, while NATO, the structure in which it is framed and constrained, features less naturally and less frequently in our analysis and actions. NATO deserves a bigger place than it has on our antimilitarist agenda.

 A Cold War anachronism
 

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization came into being through a treaty signed in Washington in 1949. It was the Cold War institution. In a sense, its creation just clinched the anti-Soviet posture that the US, Britain and allies had taken up as World War II ended, even before Japan surrendered, and the Soviets – the always-already enemy - were no longer needed as allies-of-convenience. The general objective of the states that signed the North Atlantic Treaty was to ‘safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples’. Decoded, that meant to keep ‘us’ free of communism. Its specific value for the USA was to ensure that war against the USSR would be fought on European, not American soil.There were twelve member states at the start. They were joined by Greece and Turkey three years later, and by West Germany in 1955.

President Truman had promised Stalin that West Germany would not be included in NATO. The betrayal of this agreement prompted the USSR to set up the Warsaw Pact, an opposing military alliance of those countries that would soon be called ‘the Eastern Bloc’. There followed a 35-year stand-off between the two alliances, during which no direct war was fought. Instead war was displaced to many proxy countries around the world, including Korea and Vietnam.

In 1990 the Soviet Union began to disintegrate and the Warsaw Pact was dismantled. In Cold War logic this would have been the moment to disband NATO. Instead, a NATO declaration issued in London that year affirmed its existence. It talked about extending a hand of friendship to the countries of East and Central Europe, against whom NATO’s weaponry had till then been targeted, and spoke of the Alliance helping to ‘build the structures of a more united continent, supporting …the peaceful resolution of disputes.’ But to a lot of people it was a mystery why a military alliance should be seen as necessary to peaceful conflict resolution. Gradually the politicians’ reasons for hanging onto NATO became clearer. As the USA proclaimed its vision of ‘the new American century’, the dawn of a unipolar world, NATO was going to serve both as a framework in which to hold its allies into military ‘inter-operability’, and as international camouflage to obscure the pursuit of US strategic interests, which, in turn, are cover for the interests of global capital.

Since then the trends observable in NATO have become more and more worrying, more threatening to world peace. A shift of direction was already detectable in the Strategic Concept documents of 1991 and 1999, and it has been clearer still in NATO’s policy statements and actions since the events of 9/11. Now, at the forthcoming Summit in Lisbon, a new Strategic Concept is to be adopted and launched. It is expected to confirm the following kinds of development over the next decade.

 An ever larger NATO
 

First, there is a clear intention to enlarge NATO’s membership - but in a particular way. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the priority was to recruit the old Warsaw Pact enemies. Naturally, Russia, seeing that it was going to be isolated and surrounded, was deeply disturbed by these developments. But NATO’s Secretary General hastened to say that even the risk of deteriorating relations with Russia must not be allowed to ‘derail NATO enlargement’, which ‘is not negotiable’.There is pressure now to include Sweden and Finland in NATO – because, with the melting of the Arctic ice cap, the far north is becoming an economically strategic zone. Particularly worrying is talk of Israel joining NATO . Israel desires this – and some political leaders of NATO states are in favour.

In 1994 NATO established what it calls its Partnership for Peace, a device for holding close a group of more than twenty countries, stretching from the North Atlantic into the Caucasus and Central Asia. Since then they have set up a ‘ Mediterranean Dialogue’ and an ‘Istanbul Initiative ’ drawing in many more. This enlargement strategy is beginning to make more sense if, instead of asking ‘who’s in it?’, we ask ‘who isn’t?’. It is clearly about lining up the world behind the USA in defining and isolating certain perceived enemies – among which Iran is very significant.

 A more expeditionary NATO
 

A second negative trend : NATO is behaving in ever more expeditionary and belligerent ways. Already in the nineties it was engaged in Bosnia and Kosovo. From 2001 it began to be evident that NATO would soon become involved in military actions even beyond the borders of Europe. When US targets were attacked, supposedly by Al-Qaeda, NATO’s Secretary General invoked Article 5 of the Treaty, which states that an attack on one member will be considered an attack on all. As it happened, NATO did not join the US assault on Afghanistan at that time, nor was it involved in the invasion of Iraq. However, in 2003 NATO did for the first time exert military force outside Europe, by accepting strategic command of the UN-mandated force around the Afghan capital Kabul. This was at first defined as a peace-keeping force. But we have seen what followed - NATO is now fighting a hot war in many parts of Afghanistan. 

NATO’s tendency to ‘mission creep’ is not disguised. It has publicized the recent launch of a NATO Response Force of fighting units with sea and air support, contributed on rotation by member states, which are on constant standby to deploy anywhere in the world within five days. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the new NATO Secretary General, said earlier this year in a speech in Poland that quote ‘today’s risks and threats are increasingly global in nature, and our Alliance must reflect this fact’. 

 Trying to look ‘international’
 

A third problem with NATO is its pretention to be a genuine international structure similar to the United Nations. In fact, Roland Weyl, of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has set out several ways in which NATO breaches international law . Besides, tokenistic though it may be, there is a trace of global democracy in the United Nations. The membership of the Security Council is carefully designed to ensure inclusion of countries of the global South as a brake on the powerful states of the global North. NATO embodies just the opposite principle. It is clearly an alliance of relatively rich northern states, heavily dominated by the USA. Together NATO’s member countries account for three-quarters of total world military expenditure. More and more it is a matter of the US and other rich countries and their ‘clients’ excluding and controlling ‘the rest’. 

A strange development in September 2008 illustrated this pretension to an ‘international’ character for NATO. Although the UN and NATO are totally different in purpose and composition, NATO Secretary General (it was then Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) and UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon signed a UN-NATO Joint Declaration of Co-operation . It was not widely publicized, there was barely any media comment. What was it about? It spoke of ‘effective and efficient coordination between our Organizations’, and went on, ‘Further cooperation will significantly contribute to addressing the threats and challenges to which the international community is called upon to respond. We therefore underscore the importance of establishing a framework for consultation, dialogue and cooperation, including, as appropriate, through regular exchanges and dialogue at senior and working levels on political and operational issues’. The Transnational Foundation has made a cogent critique of this move. 

 Militarizing the European Union
 

A fourth and very serious worry about NATO is the pressure it is bringing to bear for EU militarization. The desire of the USA is that Europe carry its weight, as Europe, in the project of the ‘new American century’. At the same time, since the EU should in no way seek to rival US power, it should act in compatibility with NATO. And the EU is responding in this spirit. Close co-operation between NATO and the Western European Union began soon after Maastricht. In 1996 foreign ministers agreed to build up what they called a ‘European Security and Defence Identity’ within NATO. In 2004 France, Germany and the UK launched the idea of establishing EU rapid reaction units composed of joint battle groups. From 2004 the EU has actually ‘ done ’ military. It has undertaken an operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2008 it took over counter-piracy operations from NATO.

The US thinking behind all this is expressed very neatly by Robert Gates, the US Defence Secretary, in a speech in February this year. He moaned that ‘large swathes of the general public and political class [of Europe] are averse to military force and the risks that go with it’. ‘The demilitarisation of Europe’ he said, ‘has gone from being a blessing in the 20th century to being an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the 21st.

 The insistence on nuclear weapons
 

The fifth problem NATO represents is the impediment it represents to multilateral nuclear disarmament. The Alliance’s nuclear capability encompasses that of France (348 warheads) and the UK (160 warheads) as well as the massive stockpile of 10,500 warheads in the USA. Further, the USA has the co-operation of European countries in the deployment of its highly controversial space shield, the ‘missile defence’ system. It uses British facilities at Fylingdales and Menwith Hill and has put pressure on Poland and the Czech Republic to house its radar stations. This prompted massive popular resistance in both those countries, and brought about a political crisis in the Czech Republic in March 2009.

Recently, five countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway and Germany, have called for a debate about the withdrawal of US warheads from Europe. But it appears to be non-negotiable. Hillary Clinton said in a speech at the foreign ministers meeting in Tallinn in April 2010 that ‘As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance; as a nuclear alliance, sharing nuclear risks and responsibilities widely is fundamental.’

What’s more, first strike is still not out of the question. American Friends Service Committee peace analyst Joseph Gerson wrote in his book, Empire and the Bomb, that during at least 40 wars and international crises since Nagasaki, US presidents have prepared and threatened to initiate nuclear war. In a radical 150-page manifesto for a new NATO published in January 2008, influential military thinkers close to NATO called for the Alliance to consider a ‘first strike’ policy in situations of severe international tension and to pre-empt threats from nuclear-armed enemy states. CND responded to their proposal as ‘an insane and illegal prescription that would ultimately lead to nuclear disaster’.

 ‘No-to-NATO’
 

The foregoing is a very brief sketch of just some of the problems inherent in NATO. The case against NATO has been developed much more fully in the context of the transnational movement opposing NATO. NATO has meetings of heads of state every two years or so. These have always attracted protest. But the last one, in April 2009, which was not only a 60th anniversary celebration but also attended by Barack Obama, gave rise to a sizeable protest movement. It was made up of antiwar groups and left political parties mainly from France, Germany, the UK and other NATO member states, and called itself ‘No-to-NATO’. It had an international coordinating committee, which devised a plan of protest action for Strasbourg over the weekend of the Summit meeting. The idea was to mount a three-part programme. First, there would be a ‘counter-Summit’, a big two-day antimilitarist conference with a wide range of international speakers. Second, space would be provided for a peace camp, from which non-violent direct action would be organized, specifically blockading approach roads to the building where the Summit would be held. Third there would be a mass rally and march.

 Making a ‘feminist case against NATO’
 

A group of women attending the No to NATO actions in Strasbourg organized a workshop at the counter-Summit conference, where we began to develop a ‘feminist case against NATO’. It is important to stress, at the outset, that feminists start from the very same base-line case made against NATO by all its opponents. In other words the workshop did not fail to address the problematic nature and development of NATO as set out above. However, to this general critique of NATO was added a gender critique. 

Firstly, it is a critique of NATO as an international actor . NATO is a massive military alliance of nation states. Nira Yuval-Davis and other feminist theorists have shown how the concept of ‘nation’ is profoundly gendered, how nationalism and patriarchy are structurally interlocked, and how nations and nationalists use and exploit ‘women’. Full citizenship is often linked to military service . NATO is the product of Cold War thinking, the concept of a globe divided into two ‘blocs’ of nation states, champions of rival ideologies. Some feminist contributions to the Strasbourg workshop talked about the ‘patriarchal logic’ of blocs, a brotherhood of nations in arms seeking out fantasy foes long after the original enemy is dead and buried.

Secondly, women have been making a feminist case against NATO’s military bases, installations and production facilities in our countries. Although, for the most part, these belong to the national armed forces of member states, they are in effect part and parcel of NATO resources in Europe. Several women wrote workshop papers about the damaging effect of military installations on the lives of women in neighbouring communities. They described women’s non-violent direct action outside the razor wire and security checkpoints, protesting against the toxic pollution, the danger of radiation, noise and blighted landscapes brought by militarization. Women also protest against sexual exploitation and violence against women by military personnel. In Bosnia and Kosovo, UN and NATO-led forces not only generated a massive sex industry, but individual soldiers (along with NATO contractors and UN police) were actively involved in the trafficking process, receiving trafficked women and girls at borders, smuggling them into military bases and acting as pimps. Although NATO adopted, in 2004, a Policy Against Human Trafficking, no suspected NATO traffickers have been prosecuted.

Third, the persistence of the ‘NATO system’ after the collapse of the Soviet Union has prevented the European demilitarisation so many women struggled for throughout the eighties. The populations of Europe could at that moment have gained a ‘peace dividend’ by softening international postures, reducing military spending and channelling more aid to the global South. Instead they have been required to sustain a degree of militarization that masculinizes and deforms everyday life. It has been argued that the EU is converting to this ‘hard’ masculine image in response to the chiding of US policy-makers that Europe is a feminine, soft, civilian power. European leaders want to play ‘ with the big boys ’. A commitment to contribute to a European force as well as to NATO calls for high military budgets in EU member states. Feminists argue that this drains funds from the education, health and housing services badly needed by women, the sex that still carries a very high proportion of the burden of domestic life and care. In response to the current financial crisis the British government is making brutal cuts to the &apos;social&apos; budget. So disproportionately do they bear on women that the Fawcett Society, a women&apos;s advocacy organization, is taking the government to court under sex discrimination law. 

Finally, feminist antimilitarists make a case against NATO as a perpetrator of wars.  The effects of war are dramatically gendered. There is a growing trend to civilian casualties, disproportionately women and their dependants. Women are the majority of the displaced and refugees, trying to maintain their families in impossible circumstances. Thousands are widowed, deprived of a viable existence. Sexual violence redoubles in and after war. We see all these effects in NATO’s war in Afghanistan.

 NATO’s gender hypocrisy
 

Improbable as it may seem, NATO prides itself on ‘mainstreaming’ gender into its structures and activities. ‘NATO and its Partners’, they say on their website, ’are promoting the role of women within NATO-led operations and missions’ and increasing the knowledge and skills available on ‘gender and diversity’. Last year the Strategic Commands received guidelines for the integration into the NATO Command Structure of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on ‘Women, Peace and Security’. There is a NATO Office on Gender Perspectives, and gender advisers have been appointed. An implementation report on 1325 is to be published in time for the Lisbon Summit.

The Alliance’s self-professed gender sensitivity can only deepen feminist cynicism about ‘gender mainstreaming’. Here is an alliance of powerful Western states exploiting the manly notion of ‘liberating Afghan women from oppression by the Taliban’ as one of its justifications for invading the country. Women’s insecurity is multiplied in the chaos and brutality of a decade of armed conflict. Then the intruders announce plans to make their escape by negotiating the re-entry to power of – the Taliban. Afghan women certainly have a feminist case against NATO. And so do women in NATO member states.

 Forthcoming NATO Summit
 

Another NATO Summit is almost upon us. It will be held in Lisbon 19-21 November 2010. It will be notable for the launch of a new Strategic Concept, the first since 1999. The signs are that this will recommit NATO to the strategies about which concern has been expressed in this paper - membership enlargement, military expansionism, militarization of the EU, and the retention of nuclear weapons. We need to be alert to what goes on in Lisbon. We aim to use the media attention it will generate to make our case as women against NATO, in coordinated actions in a number of cities to make ‘the NATO problem’ more visible to the public in our countries, especially the women, and at the same time make our opposition clearly visible to NATO.

The Trick or Treat Pail with animation, along with the included hat (hair not included) is shown above. The textures and details on the skirt and bows are so darned cute that I took a closeup for you. Click to enlarge.

Next up is Black lace’s LOW (Letter of the Week) sale item – Tease – Fall Leaves. I forget the exact cost of this one, but L$59 sticks in my mind. It’s a lovely lingerie set that’s perfect for Fall and not just Halloween.

 

The witchy hat with hair is from /Wasabi Pills/ which is taking part in the Industry District’s Halloween sale event Something Wicked This Way Comes that began Wednesday and lasts through the 31st (I think). Each merchant has placed a special item on sale [...]

 A Lazy Sunday Planning Ahead 
 [ Cleveland , Cleveland, OH ] ( The DiaTribe )
As the events in Madison last night ensure that 2010 will go down as one of the most disappointing news for sports on the North Coast, and not just in recent memory, we wait for Colt McCoy to be thrown into the fire in the Steel City and await what figures to be a Sunday on par with what we’ve been experiencing all year.

Nevertheless, the weather is beautiful outside and the leaves are various stages of turning and falling, so let’s enjoy the best time of the year in Cleveland…regardless of the events in the sporting world that have affected us over the last year. Before we go out to enjoy said weather though, let’s get loose on a Lazy One…

With the news that The Atomic Wedgie will be heading out to the Emerald City (where I can’t imagine Milton Bradley sticks around), allow me to direct your eyes to a terrific piece from Andrew Humphries of LGT that effectively shines a light on Wedge’s shortcomings and oversights as the Indians’ manager (Garko in LF, among other topics, brilliantly skewered) under the guise of Wedge’s “convincing” nature in an interview.

Other than Wedge being a man-in-demand as teams interviewed for managerial openings, the only real happenings in the Wigwam this week came courtesy of the Choo “story” that he had given an interview to some Korean reporters in LAX , setting off the requisite firestorm of manufactured negativity and outrage locally, as the doom-and-gloom that Choo wanted to leave (and the intellectual leap that he was “right” to leave because the Indians were a minor-league team) became an accepted reaction to this “story”.

Of course as you can see in the linked story, the Indians refuted the story came out in Wednesday’s print edition, and with the PD waiting until Friday morning to pass along the rebuttal of fact as well as the original reporters “apology” online . However, it is interesting in this timeline that until the PD printed the “apology” piece in Saturday’s paper (page D4, no less), despite the fact that another Korean journalist attempted to clear the air in the message below that was picked up both by the link provided by Castro and Calcaterra hours after the PD ran the initial story :
 Choo said, purely out of envy, he wanted to play on a winning team after watching other guys pop champagne for clinching playoff berths. But he didn’t say the word “transfer” (should have been translated into ‘trade’&apos; It’s baseball, not soccer) as far as I know. But he also said he wants to stay with one club for a long time and Cleveland would be his first choice. Then he said his agent would take care of his contract situation and that he hadn’t heard anything special from the agent. 

This is all pretty fuzzy stuff as it was clearly a he-said-he-said situation made cloudier by translation and the context of the answer (in terms of what question it was in response to) or even what Choo really said remains a mystery. Choo was probably asked if he’s been watching the playoffs and responded that it would be nice to be in a position to “pop champagne for clinching playoff berths”, which he obviously has not in Cleveland.

Really though, we don’t know what he said as we have the original story (passed on by the PD) and the rebuttal (passed along by Castro and Calcaterra...and two days later, by the PD) providing disparate messages. Ultimately, it was a non-story (though it did remain the lead Indians’ story on cle.com for a solid two days, garnering all sorts of outrage and inane baseball philosophizing from those who specialize in outrage and inanity) that was refuted quickly after it was published by multiple media outlets.

So, yeah…nothing to see here, please move along…
Regardless, since The BLC is the Tribe’s top priority (the way that getting Aerosmith tickets was once the “top priority of the summer” for some high-schoolers in the mid-70s), let’s use the Choo story as the segue into what the Indians should be looking to do this off-season since...well, there are no real “stories” to talk about, other than the miraculous possible return of (knocking firmly on wood) Atom Miller .

 Since all of the “here’s what happened” pieces have been written and the 2010 season has been examined by the coroner and the funeral directory and now lies 6 feet deep, the attention has to turn to the future and what the off-season holds (or should hold) for YOUR Cleveland Indians. What they should do, besides obviously making some changes to their uniforms (and from the looks of the front of the 2011 schedule that was handed out at the last home game, it looks as if a switch to the white border around the “C” may be in the offing), can be broken down into moves that are going to happen, like re-signing arbitration-eligible players (though the manner in which they happen is up for debate), and the moves that could happen, like acquiring new players via Free Agency or via trades.

Thus, if I may be so bold, allow me to present to you the one man’s blueprint for the Indians’ off-season. It may not lead to a rush on the Tribe Box Office or jam up the 216-420-HITS line, but it presents a realistic approach to the off-season, acknowledging where this team is (not simply one or two players away from obvious contention) and what the organization should be using 2011 as in an effort to create a legitimate contender in the AL Central...just not necessarily in 2011.

Perhaps you feel that the team is closer to making a run at the AL Central in 2011, but this season showed (me, at least) that the Indians are going to be counting on injured players returning to form AND young players taking the a step out of the abyss AND continued the health and maturation of nearly all of their young talent. Maybe one of those things happens and we’re all pleasantly surprised as the 2011 begins, but I’m having trouble seeing it all come together for the team next year and figure that 2012 is what the team should realistically shoot for in terms of arrival, instead of deluding themselves that just a few pieces and parts need to be added this off-season.

Thus, without further ado or introduction, here are the moves that I’d like to see the Indians execute in this off-season, getting as specific as possible in most cases:
 Money Now, Options Later 
This has gotten more “ink” than probably any first-year arbitration-eligible case in recent memory (other than Ryan Howard’s) and revisiting this topic is taking the 9-iron to that dead horse on the ground over there as nobody knows what approach Scott Boras is going to bring to the table, nor does anyone know how Boras is going to manipulate the media into painting Choo as a “victim” in this process. Boras could come to the bargaining table with a portfolio that puts Choo on par with the game’s elite (and I could probably put that portfolio together for him) in the last three years and could ask for the moon .

It’s not likely that Boras gives away a year or two (or more) of FA without some serious dollars being involved and, seeing how Choo will be 31 when the 2013 season ends (the last year he’s under Tribe control right now), I’m not sure if committing huge dollars to a player that will be 32 or 33 or 34 in the later years of a guaranteed contract is the path the Indians should be taken given recent contracts to similarly-aged players, positional value or not.

Regardless of all of that, this arbitration process is still a process and the precedents are there for both Boras and the Indians to use as parameters. Jon Steiner at WFNY (the Choo-contract expert) lays out those parameters very well and ultimately sees one of three outcomes this off-season:
 • They go to arbitration. ChooBoras lose their $5.5 million demand. Choo makes $3.9 million.
• They sign a one-year deal worth $4.5 million.
• They sign a three-year deal: 2011 – $4 million; 2012 – $6.5 million; 2013 – $10.5 million. 

I think that the numbers there are about right (and Scenario #3 pays him $21M over 3 years), but if you’re asking me how I approach it, I still think that “front-loading” or “leveling the numbers” in the contract and giving Choo money in 2011 and 2012 that he certainly wouldn’t earn in the arbitration process is the only way that the Indians entice Choo to add an extra year, or an option, on the deal past 2013.

What that means would be something along the lines ( as I said a while back ) of doing something where the Indians give him, “a 3-year deal worth $24M to buy out his arbitration years...and work the numbers so he’s getting paid $8M annually and not on some sort of escalating scale” as these arbitration years usually progress.

If the Indians give Choo $3M to $4M more than he’d likely earn in arbitration for 2011 and a couple million dollars more than he’d likely earn in arbitration for 2012, is it enough of an enticement to have Boras agree to a $12M club option for 2014, with something like a $2M buyout?

Who knows, and the Indians have a history of locking up “key” arbitration-eligible players in the past, but we certainly haven&apos;t heard the end of this one...whether we want to or not.

 Holding off on Extensions 
Speaking of that history of locking up “key” arbitration-eligible players in the past, I realize that I’m probably in the minority on this, but I don’t offer either Chris Perez or Asdrubal Cabrera long-term deals, attempting to (as the Indians have done in the past) buy out arbitration years and maybe a year of FA, with a club option on top of that.

As I said, this may not be the popular move among many, but the reality is that Perez is coming off of his best season to date (with the question of whether it is sustainable in the volatile world of relief pitchers being EXTREMELY relevant) and Cabrera is coming off his worst (in terms of performance vs. expectations), so the question is whether the Indians should attempt to parlay more guaranteed money in 2011 and 2012 into gaining club control past 2013.

If I’m making that decision right now, as much as Chris F. Perez asserted himself down the stretch for the Indians in 2010 and looks to have finally stabilized the 9th inning for the Tribe, I still go year-to-year right now with Perez, simply given that volatility of relievers and with the idea that there are no guarantees (Ferd Cabrera v.2005, Jenny Lewis v.2008) for success from one year to waterfall into the next for relievers. Maybe Perez is that exception (and, truthfully, I hope that he is), but I’d exchange numbers with Perez’s people and sign him to a one-year deal.

The intent is not to screw Perez out of guaranteed money or to intimate that I don’t think that 2010 is him just scratching the surface, but in Cleveland we’ve become so USED to the idea that we HAVE to lock all of these guys up because that’s what has been done. In reality, with positions like relievers and with players who are still relatively unproven (sorry, as great as that post-All-Star break ERA is, it is still less than 30 innings of MLB), the idea to go year-to-year (or simply delay a decision on a long-term deal) is a luxury that the Indians have, and in the case of Perez, they should use it.

Similarly, with Cabrera coming off of his worst season (in terms of what we thought we would see from him), the arbitration process should be used by the Indians to not only determine whether Cabrera will fulfill the potential that seemed to high in 2007 and 2009 and even potentially motivate Cabrera to prove his worth to the team.

While it may not have been widely reported, the fact is that Cabrera has come into the last few years out of shape, certainly affecting his range in the field and perhaps affecting his performance at the plate. If he’s coming into Spring Training out of shape and has not shown the commitment to conditioning to maximize his talent (particularly defensively), is that the type of player that you’d like to “reward” with a long-term deal?

The sentiment may exist that the Indians should be “buying low” on Cabrera, with the opportunity to lock up his services at a discounted rate, but motivation may be a factor and, after seeing Fausto Carmona sprout a spare tire after signing his long-term deal, I’d be more inclined to use 2011 as a proving ground for Cabrera, for him to utilize it to show that he is worthy of receiving a long-term deal and that he should be thought of as a “core” player for the Tribe.

Memories of Jhonny Peralta’s decline from 2005 to 2009 are too fresh to not let it serve as a lesson as to how a promising player can get stuck in neutral (or worse) and the decreasing range and the expanding waistline of Cabrera in the past two years play too much into my fear that Peralta’s career arc is the one that Asdrubal is following. Maybe I’m wrong, but I’d use 2011 to find out instead of simply rewarding Cabrera for past performance instead of future production.

All told with these two, just because it has always been the Tribe’s MO to lock up arbitration years and buy a couple of years of FA doesn’t mean that it’s unequivocally a great idea for every player as soon as they hit arbitration. Look at Rafael Perez, who righted the ship in 2010 (his first arbitration-eligible year) but certainly isn’t looked at as a candidate for a long-term deal because sometimes you just don’t know. Sometimes, going year-to-year with players isn’t a horrible strategy and with Perez (let’s see if he can sustain it) and Cabrera (let’s see if he can arise from his ashes), the Indians shouldn’t be too eager to sign either...even from a PR standpoint.

 Jettison the Flotsam and Jetsam 
In terms of keeping it with players currently on the 40-man roster, this one should be fairly easy and won’t get a lot of fanfare, but the Indians used 2009 and 2010 to “clear the decks” of their veteran players who didn’t obviously fit in past this year, and now it’s time to do the same with the young players that don’t obviously fit in past this year. My short list includes Crowe, Hodges, Marte, and Brown...and those are just the position players.

To all, I would wish the best of luck, but point out that if you were unable to seize the opportunity presented to you in 2010 (Crowe, who cannot field or hit) or were so far down the organizational pecking order given how much opportunity was out there in 2010 (Hodges, Marte, Brown), it would appear that your services are no longer required by the organization.

Perhaps you want to make the case for Crowe and Brown (most notably) to stick around, given their remaining options and the question marks that remain around 1B and LF, but I would counter that this team should be focusing on developing players that have the potential to be difference-makers (or at least better than replacement level) and these former prospects, now a little long in the tooth, have become redundancies in the organization and should be replaced by players, either internally (Ezequiel Carrera, for one, in the 4th OF mix) or from outside the organization (getting a RH bat to play 1B and/or LF usurps Brown’s usefulness) in an effort to truly upgrade the roster.

Certainly roster fodder like Drew Sutton and Luke Carlin fall into this category, so the Indians should thank them for their contributions while receiving thanks from the players for the opportunity and move on. If either wants to see how beautiful Columbus can be in the summertime next year, fine...but these players should have seen their last of the home locker room at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario.

Lest you think I’m ready to simply throw everyone under the bus, Jensen Lewis does not get included here on the strength of the manner in which he closed out the season. Maybe that’s foolhardy (as Lewis has closed out seasons strong before) and maybe Lewis being out of options will prevent him from sticking around for too long. But maybe...just maybe, Lewis has finally figured out his role on this team – not as a 9th inning option, but rather as an organizational arm that bounces around the bullpen depending his effectiveness – and can at least settle into a 6th or 7th inning option while the arms in AAA sort themselves out. Additionally, for whatever reason and against my better judgment, I’m not including Chris Giminez on this list, mainly because of his status as the designated “pile-jumper” on the team and because his versatility (particularly as a C) holds some value, even if his bat does not.

At the end of the day, the time to move past some of the high draft picks (or, in the case of Marte, players traded for) who were supposed to represent the talent infusion that took place between 2008 and now. That “infusion” didn’t happen and the Indians should cut their losses with these guys and move on.

 An Old Face for a Troubled Place 
Moving onto the portion of the program that involves the acquisition of talent, the most obvious hole that will be filled (to some degree) this off-season is at the Hot Corner. As has been stated numerous times, given the Indians’ gaping hole at 3B and their lack of an obvious internal candidate at 3B (sorry, Nix is a miscast utility player who was forced into 3B and looked incapable of handling it defensively), the Indians will add to the MLB roster with a player that they hope can serve as a bridge to top prospect Lonnie Chisenhall, who figures to start the 2011 season in AAA.

Given what we saw from Indians’ 3B in 2010, it has been (correctly) asserted that the Indians should be looking after a 3B capable of settling their infield defense and the name on the FA market that continually comes up is...no, not Adrian Beltre...one Brandon Inge. Truth be told, the pickings are very slim among FA 3B and maybe you’re in the “Brandon Inge would be a great fit”camp, but realize that Inge’s offense from last year was not that far above what Jayson Nix put forth in Cleveland:
 Inge 2010 
.247 BA / .321 OBP / .397 SLG / .718 OPS in 580 PA

 Nix 2010 (with Cleveland) 
.234 BA / .283 OBP / .422 SLG / .705 OPS in 306 PA
I know...I know, defense is the thing and I’ve been the one touting that, but Inge is probably going to sign with Tigers for too many years and for too much money , based on his age and his production and for the Indians to lure Inge away from Detroit (which probably isn’t a great idea anyways) is going to involve multiple years and too much money for a 3B in his 30&apos;s fresh off a .718 OPS season. Yes, his defense is fantastic, but not for the years and the money that would predicate that defense arriving on the North Coast.

Looking at the list of what could be available , if defense is the focus (and it should be), guys like Edwin Encarnacion (who will possibly be non-tendered) need not apply, which brings us to an intriguing name to watch as other teams decide who they non-tender. The name is a familiar one as it belongs to former Tribe 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff, who could get non-tendered by Oakland, making him available on the FA market.

If K2 is, in fact, non-tendered, by the Athletics, the Indians should attempt to add him to the mix as he’s a solid, if unspectacular defensive 3B (who has never played a defensive position other than 3B...unlike one Jayson Nix), who would be a RH addition to a LH-heavy lineup. He earned $3.1M last year in Oakland and while his offensive numbers were far from good (.247 BA / .283 OBP / .396 SLG / .679 OPS), he wouldn’t be too expensive, nor would it take a multi-year deal to lock him up and to add his glove to the defensive infield. If the A’s tender Kouzmanoff, the Indians will have to go in another direction (which could involve attempting to acquire Kouzmanoff) and that idea that they could replicate the approach that they used in 2003 – sign a bunch of older guys who are still looking for their first MLB opportunity to battle with Nix to see if a Casey Blake can emerge – could be the path of least resistance, mainly because the other MLB options aren’t really all that compelling.

As AC says in his “Inbox” , Joe Crede could also be had, but that would be the same Crede that didn’t play in 2010, so none of these alternatives come without red flags or major issues. If you want to extend the interest out to the likes of Miggy Tejada and Mel Mora, that’s fine, but defensive liabilities like Edwin Encarnacion and Jorge Cantu shouldn’t be considered, nor should Felipe Lopez who the Cardinals were so eager to get out of their clubhouse. You could make a case for a failed prospect like Andy LaRoche benefiting from a change in scenery, but improving the infield defense should be the primary objective here.

Since I’m not too keen on delving into the black hole that I see in attempting to parse through defensive metrics (as they contradict each other and I’m not smart enough to tell you what metric is the definitive one to look at), the Indians should simply be looking for a place-holder that plays good defense. I know that the approach to simply find a place-holder is not going to sell more tickets, but unless you see that one special player on the FA market that I do not, I think that the glove-first 3B is the way to go until The Chiz is ready.

Of course, the Indians have internal options in Nix and Phelps, but I’m more inclined to let Nix evolve into the super-utility role in which he is most valuable and allow Phelps some time at 3B in AAA before handing the keys over to him. As I’ve said before, I’m not including Jared Goedert in this “internal options” list as his main liability (defense) is what the Indians are looking to improve.

If The Chiz is truly waiting in the wings, then the Indians should not over-commit to any one player and look for that place-holder and, among the many unappealing options, the Indians should go after a guy like Kouzmanoff (assuming availability), relegate Nix to the super-utility role and wait for The Chiz to arrive to the corner of Carnegie and Ontario (hopefully by mid-season) to theoretically settle what has been an unsettled position.

 Pitching Tiers...or Tears 
If adding a 3B to the mix is viewed as a necessity, inserting another arm into the rotation could perhaps be viewed as a luxury. That is said not because an arm is not needed, but rather because of what “another arm” that would be an upgrade over the current rotation is going to cost and whether spending that kind of money is what this team should be doing NOW, at this stage of the “cycle”.

To wit, Fangraphs (who actually provided an article worthy of mention here) conducted an exercise called “Crowdsourcing” for Carl Pavano, attempting to predict what Hot Carl would receive on the open market as a Free Agent. The result of the Pavano Crowdsourcing was a 2-to-3 year deal at about $9M to $10M per year ...um, so there’s that.

Anybody want to commit those years and that type of money to an arm like Hot Carl Pavano, given where the Indians currently stand as an organization?

As much as I want to believe that it isn’t the case, as I said earlier, this team isn’t one pitcher away from obviously contending...they’re a couple of position players rebounding from major injury and a few pitchers continuing their maturation away from legitimately looking like a contender for 2011. Maybe that happens in 2011 and the Indians look at add an arm as the season progresses, but throwing money and years at marginal-to-good starting pitchers shouldn’t interest the Indians this off-season.

For one, you have to remember how expensive even marginal starting pitching is on the FA market. On top of that, as much as 2010 gave us a glimpse at what COULD be with some of the starters, they are far from known quantities and adding a top-shelf veteran arm makes the rotation deeper and stronger, but to what end?

Yes, perhaps Jake Westbrook comes back to take care of “unfinished business” in Cleveland after “earning” $33M from the Tribe over the last 3 years and, if he does so for less money...well, then he’s my favorite Indian ever. The reality of the Westbrook situation is that Jake posted a 3.38 ERA with a 1.25 WHIP after going to St. Louis and some NL team (maybe St. Louis) is going to give Jake more than a couple of years on a deal for money that will probably be closer to $10M than it will be to $5M per year. Should the Indians be in on that?

As I said, maybe Jake defies the logic of all professional sports and returns to Cleveland for fewer years and less money because of what happened in the last three years, but I’ll believe it when I see it.

Outside of Pavano and Westbrook, the FA pitcher that interests me is Hiroki Kuroda...but again, it comes back to how expensive starting pitching is on the FA market, particularly for players that thrived in 2010, as Pavano, Westbrook, and Kuroda (3.39 ERA, 1.16 WHIP in 2010 with the Dodgers) did.

So if the Indians aren’t going to be willing to offer multiple years to second-tier guys like Pavano, Westbrook, and Kuroda (and perhaps rightfully so), they move onto the third-tier of FA pitcher – the scratch and dent section. Included in this tier are the likes of Bruce Chen, Brandon Webb, Javier Vazquez, Chris Young, Ben Sheets, Justin Duchscherer, Jeremy Bonderman, all of whom come with injury or performance concerns and all who are likely to be available on a shorter, incentive-laden deal...but with good reason.

The Indians can mine this group to see if they can find another diamond in the rough, like they did with Kevin Millwood – who is also available and may be able to impart on the current young staff the same “lessons” that he did on a young staff back in 2005 – and later with Carl Pavano. Who among that group of Webb, Sheets, Bonderman, etc. fits that profile is above my pay grade, and the Indians’ track record of picking the guy about to rebound has earned them the benefit of the doubt in this department.

However, it is important to allow past to be our prologue as it has been noted that the 2010 season and the 2003 season could be similar in terms of placement on the developmental cycle of the team being built up. That being said, let’s all remember that the additions made to a young starting rotation in the off-season between the 2003 and 2004 seasons were...wait for it...Jeff D’Amico and Jeriome Robertson

D’Amico was an instance of dumpster diving, but the ill-fated acquistion of Robertson is perhaps an interesting precedent. As bad as the Robertson deal looks in hindsight (the Indians gave up Luke Scott for Robertson, who would throw all of 14 1/3 innings for them in 2004 and never make it back to MLB), perhaps the 2010 fill their rotational need by exploring a trade for a starting pitcher.

The instant corollary to that would be who the Indians would have to offer in a trade in as much as we’d all like to say, “go out and get a young starter” on the Trade Market like Jair Juerrjens ( who one AJC columnist thinks should be moved ), the question becomes which players on the Indians are that compelling to make and whether trading our young players is, again, what the Indians should be doing now. If it takes trading guys like Kipnis or Chisenhall, I don’t think that they make that move, unless a team is high on a Tribe prospect whose place in the future lineup or staff isn’t obvious.

If we’re talking trade, the likely avenue would be to buy low on a guy like Zach Duke (if the infield defense is truly going to be improved) or someone of his ilk, with the Indians asking Neal Huntington which of the failed Indians’ prospects he would like in the Steel City and taking on Duke in exchange in the hopes that some semblance of an MLB pitcher still resides in his body or that a change of scenery would benefit him. Similarly, always-suggestive reader John Mast floated the name of Homer Bailey out there as a player who could also benefit from a change of scenery.

Regardless of how they add an arm, I have the feeling that an arm will be added…and maybe even two. Those arms, however, will come either with major recent injury and the risk that comes with it (Webb, Sheets, etc.), major recent performance issues (Duke, Brian Bannister, etc.) or with the obvious warts that accompany forays into the lower tiers of available starting pitching. To me, I think that you go out and buy a lottery ticket like Webb in the hopes that he can re-gain his stature with the Tribe (who have a history of being the springboard for players looking to increase value) and go out and get another arm from another organization, like Duke, to lengthen out the starting rotation and to allow Tomlin and Gomez start the season in AAA, if only until the newly acquired arms reveal themselves.

 Mighty Righty 
Going back to the position player side of things, an obvious need of the team (past 3B) is to add a RH bat that factors into the OF/DH/1B mix as Travis Hafner’s shoulder is likely to prevent him from playing every day in 2011 and his disparate splits from 2010 (.863 vs. RHP, .706 vs. LHP) necessitate the Indians bringing someone in to take some AB away from him, particularly when facing LHP. Additionally, given that the three presumed OF for 2010 are all LH, the ability of that RH bat to play OF would assist in filling a couple of holes all at once.

While that wish for a RH bat that plays the OF may be the ideal set up, I’ll bang the drum again for a player like Mike Napoli (although he doesn’t play the OF, obviously), as his name the one that keeps jumping out to me. Of course, he would need to be traded for and will earn some cash because of arbitration, but Napoli could probably be had from the Angels and he posted a .966 OPS vs. LHP in 2010. On a team that is largely LH, Napoli could prove his mettle by being a big RH bat against LHP and could ostensibly operate in a 3-way platoon at C, 1B, and DH with the various incarnations looking like this:
Against RHP
DH – Hafner
C – Santana
1B – LaPorta

Against LHP
DH – Santana/LaPorta
C – Napoli
1B – LaPorta/Santana

If they followed through with that, it gives Santana a bit of a break from behind the plate, although it does leave Lou Marson out of the equation. While leaving Marson out of the equation may be just fine for some, realize that Marson had a .759 OPS vs. LHP in 2010 and, while that pales in comparison to what Napoli puts up against LHP, maybe the Indians use a similar utilization against RHP and LHP, with internal options, looking something like this:
Against RHP
DH – Hafner
C – Santana
1B – LaPorta

Against LHP
DH – Santana/LaPorta
C – Marson
1B – LaPorta/Santana

If that becomes the arrangement (though it wouldn’t necessarily be hard and fast as Marson and Hafner probably wouldn’t be in a straight platoon), it would give Hafner some days off WHILE allowing Santana to come out from behind the plate every once in a while to limit the wear and tear on his body. If that is the case, the question becomes how the Indians still add that RH bat, with the focus moving almost completely to the OF. Perusing through the list of potential FA, playoff hero Cody Ross would be an option (.883 OPS vs. LHP in 2010), as would Matt Diaz (.830 OPS vs. LHP in 2010) and while neither of those players is going to set the world afire, each can play a competent OF and provide some security against Sizemore not being able to play every day or right out of the chute. Truthfully, we’re talking about upgrading Trevor Crowe’s spot here and...those are not the biggest shoes to fill.

Of course, they could stick with Shelley Duncan (.857 OPS vs. LHP) in the role that he played to some critical acclaim but, as I said, they really could be looking to replace Crowe with a RH bat that could provide some pop against LHP. If they’re simply replacing Crowe, they keep Duncan around and add a player like Ross or Diaz to be a legitimate RH OF (sorry, Duncan’s not a legit OF...as hard as he may try) and give the lineup multiple looks with Marson, Duncan, Ross/Diaz, and Nix all coming off of the bench as RH options.

Given Ross’ recent playoff heroics and the unnecessary cost that may accompany his newfound stature, the choice here would be Matt Diaz, who can play all 3 OF positions and is RH so he can sub for any and all of the LH OF and can spell Hafner, when needed, as the DH or allow one of the OF to slide over to DH when Hafner needs a break.

 Stabilizing the Back-End 
While 3B, the rotation, and a RH bat have been well-publicized “needs” of the team, the final one that I see to be just as glaring involves adding an experienced RHP to the back-end of the bullpen. Though the Indians are touting the performance of the bullpen in the second half, let’s realize that the RHP that figure into the 2011 bullpen past Chris F. Perez are Joe Smith, Jensen Lewis, Justin Germano and a bunch of promising AAA pitchers, like Vinnie Pestano and Zach Putnam.

Do you really feel comfortable that one of those guys can assume that 7th or 8th inning RH role for 2011?

Maybe this is from the experience of watching the bullpen deep-six the 2006 and 2008 seasons (among other reasons), but I don’t and I think that a priority this off-season would be to add a RH reliever to the late-inning mix to assist Rafael Perez and Tony Sipp in serving as the bridge from the 6th to the 9th innings, when necessary. However, dealing in the FA market for relievers is a dicey proposition because of the Elias Rankings of Type A and Type B players and the fact that signing a Type A player means that the Indians would have to give up their 2nd Round Pick in next year’s draft (our 1st Round Pick would be protected because it is top 15) to sign a reliever that would ostensibly be a set-up man. Maybe you think that a set-up man is that important, but seeing as how Jason Kipnis was the 2nd Round Pick in 2009, I’m staying away from the Type A Free Agent relievers.

For a quick look at Type A and Type B Free Agents, here’s the exhaustive list and just parsing through the relievers, you can quickly scratch off your Type A Free Agents, which would be Rafael Soriano, Mariano Rivera, Matt Thornton, Matt Guerrier, Scott Downs, Dan Wheeler, Jason Frasor, Grant Balfour, Frank Francisco, Arthur Rhodes, and Takishi Saito.

Sure, Matt Guerrier or Scott Downs would look great in that 8th inning role, but the crazy Elias rankings and the cost of a top draft pick would preclude much interest for me in those players as Type A FA. Much more interesting is the list of Type B Free Agents, whose signing would not result in the Indians giving up a draft pick for 2011. That Type B List is as follows, in terms of Relief Pitchers that are RH, with each player’s ERA+ for 2010 indicated after the name:
Joaquin Benoit – 295 ERA+
JJ Putz – 154 ERA+
Koji Uehara – 149 ERA+
Trevor Hoffman – 141 ERA+
Jesse Crain – 137 ERA+
Jon Rauch – 134 ERA+
Kerry Wood – 133 ERA+
Kevin Gregg – 119 ERA+
Chad Durbin – 106 ERA+
Octavio Dotel – 101 ERA+
Randy Choate – 94 ERA+
Aaron Heilman – 94 ERA+
Chad Qualls – 57 ERA+

A couple of those guys are going to be signed to closer money next year with the idea that they will be closing – I’d put Benoit, Putz, Rauch, Gregg, and probably Wood on that list – meaning that you’re talking about guys like Jesse Crain and Chad Durbin who might be on the Indians’ radar. If the Indians could pull off a guy like Benoit or even Kevin Gregg (who saved 37 games last year in Toronto) to further solidify the back-end of the bullpen, I’m all for it. But my guess is that some team (or teams) is going to look at Benoit, Putz, Rauch, Gregg, and (again) probably Wood as legitimate closing options and offer them more years and money than the Indians should be looking to commit for a set-up guy.

If you’re asking me to put one name out there, I’d say Jesse Crain in that he would strengthen the back end of that bullpen with a legitimate RH option to slot in front of Perez. Adding a Jesse Crain suddenly gives the 7th and 8th innings a more fleshed out feel with Crain, R. Perez, and Sipp serving as the set-up men, allowing the likes of Joe Smith, Jenny Lewis, Justin Germano and the gaggle of MiLB arms to sort themselves out and force themselves into that late-inning mix instead of simply being handed the keys to the 7th or 8th innings.

 Pulling it All Together 
In sum, what are we looking at here?
Other than the internal machinations of arbitration and 40-man housecleaning, I’d like to see the Indians add Kouzmanoff, an injury reclamation project like Brandon Webb, a performance reclamation project like Zach Duke, a RH OF like Matt Diaz, and a RH set-up man like Jesse Crain. While I’m not smart enough to know what the FA market or the trade market will dictate in terms of acquiring those players, it would seem that the Indians should be able to add those ancillary pieces and parts (without breaking the bank) so you go into the 2011 season looking something like this:
C – Santana
1B – LaPorta
2B – Donald
SS – Cabrera
3B – Kouzmanoff
RF – Choo
CF – Brantley
LF – Sizemore
DH – Hafner

Bench – Marson
Bench – Nix
Bench – Diaz
Bench – Duncan

SP – Carmona
SP – Masterson
SP – Carrasco
SP – Duke and, later, Webb
SP – Talbot

Closer – C. Perez
RP – Crain
RP – R. Perez
RP – Sipp
RP – Smith
RP – Lewis
RP – Germano/Laffey/name a MiLB reliever

You may look at that and say that the roster is not all that dissimilar from the 2010 roster and wonder what improvement would be expected by simply adding those auxiliary pieces like Kouzmanoff or Diaz or Crain, but let’s be honest about – this in that the major improvement that the Indians have to see is not from pieces they add from the FA market or through minor trades, but from the development of their own players.

The recoveries of Sizemore and Santana and the improvement from guys like LaPorta, Brantley, Masterson, and Carrasco are MUCH more important to the long-term health of the team than adding one or two players from outside the organization. Thus, you pick and choose where you add those players and how you add them in an effort to augment what will hopefully be the burgeoning “core” of players already in place.

At first glance, this off-season list doesn’t look like a blueprint necessarily for instant success, but the Indians shouldn’t necessarily be looking for instant success (as much as it pains me to acknowledge that) and should be looking to continue building the foundation for something more special than simply a .500 season and a shot at the AL Central. If recent history has shown us anything, the ability to compete with the elite of the AL is what the Indians should be looking towards and adding a piece or two to the current group of players doesn’t accomplish that.

That may not be the popular approach, given where the Indians currently sit in terms of attendance and PR, but the “popular” approach doesn’t always mean the same thing as the “prudent” approach and the “prudent” approach for the Indians should be the continued development of their internal talent and augmenting that talent in specific places while not deluding themselves to go further than they should in terms of adding talent from the outside.

Some day soon (hopefully), the Indians should be active in attempting to add that one piece to flesh out a roster that looks to be on the cusp of being special…that day just hasn’t arrived yet for these Indians.

 One Of The Biggest Missed Marketing Opportunities In US History

In the Inbound Marketing book , I wrote a case study about how an unknown, Black senator with a funny name and no money (Barack Obama) was able to beat the Hillary Clinton machine using brilliant, modern marketing methods. Two years later, I think that same guy missed the biggest, most obvious marketing opportunity in US history.

If I were Obama, I would have stood up in front the country from the Oval Office on July 4, 2010 with a live video of the oil gushing out of the gulf behind me and announced an energy independence initiative with a goal of getting us off our addiction to oil by 2020. In the address, I would have compared the new energy independence mission to JFK&apos;s mission to the moon in importance, scope, and historical significance. I would have laid out the following reasons for the energy independence initiative:

1. By getting off our addiction to oil, the country would end up being far less invested in the Middle East and would be unlikely to continue to lose our brave young citizens in foreign deserts.

2. By getting off our addiction to oil, the country would do far less damage to our environment and would start doing its part to slow down the impact of global warming, lest our coastal cities end up under water. 

3. By getting off our addiction to oil, we would have to invest in building a major new energy industry which should end up being a major net exporter for us and a major driver of job growth the way the computer industry, movie industry (Hollywood), biotech and others are for us today. If we don&apos;t build this industry and technology, someone else will.

4. By getting off our addiction to oil, we could stop building super complicated oils rigs off our coasts and stop shipping giant containers of oil around the globe, both of which are giant, ticking environmental time bombs . 

   

This summer&apos;s oil spill captivated the nation. We were shocked at the scale and severity -- for most of us, it was a real wake-up call. Obama missed the window to capitalize on that consciousness and rally the nation around the audacious goal of tranforming the environment, the economy, and our national security in one sweeping initiative.

Here at HubSpot, we are not advocates for the Democratic party, the Republican party, the Tea Party, or the Frat Party, but I do think Obama missed a whopper of an opportunity to turn a huge negative into a huge positive.

P.S. One thing I don&apos;t understand is why the Obama team does not use video and Powerpoint in their presentations to help make their points. I get that standing up in front of people or the camera and doing a speech without visual aids is a tradition that is hundreds of years old, but this guy is a black belt in breaking with tradition. Just as FDR used radio to better communicate with the country with his fireside chats, Obama&apos;s team should start using powerpoint, video, etc to help him deliver his message to the country. They weren&apos;t afraid to use new web technology like Facebook, Twitter, SMS, etc to get elected, why not use new tools to communicate with the country to sell their ideas? There is a reason that Steve Jobs doesn&apos;t do his keynote addresses without Powerpoint/Keynote slides -- they help him drive home his points!

We asked Richard Wentworth, Tacita Dean, Yinka Shonibare and Cornelia Parker to choose the young artist they find most promising – and tell us why

HELEN MARTEN chosen by RICHARD WENTWORTH


Sculptor Richard Wentworth is quite clear why 24-year-old Helen Marten is a young artist to watch: &quot;I admire her sureness, fearlessness and lack of hubris,&quot; he says. &quot;It is complicated for her generation. It is as if they were in a ludicrous souk. But she is like a fantastic tourist: intelligently acquisitive, yet editorially selective. She is a brilliant fossicker. She knows how to look.&quot;

 A is for anarchy… is the title of one of Marten&apos;s series – and do not expect any of her work to be law-abiding. She is an artist for whom anything can be subverted: the world&apos;s potential grist for her satirical mill. She is captivatingly articulate about what she describes as &quot;environmental window shopping&quot;. She was not sure she was going to be an artist (there has always been a competing literary pull), but she did a foundation year at Byam Shaw – part of St Martins – and a degree course at Ruskin (which she calls Oxford&apos;s &quot;dirty little sibling&quot;). She introduces me to a sculpture that invokes George Nelson, father of American modernism, made of &quot;slick, sleazy powder-coated aluminium&quot;. She describes it as &quot;at once corporate and semi-baroque&quot; and &quot;anchored&quot; by a white PVC tailored suit jacket that is &quot;seedy and flaccid&quot;. We also inspect A is for anarchy…, two 3D letter As. The first is sub-titled &quot;Thug Life&quot; and is a &quot;hard, knotty ringleader&quot;. The second, his &quot;sidekick&quot;, is &quot;slobby, messy, getting into bad scrapes&quot;.

She revels in the &quot;remeshing&quot; of the design canon (the more you know about design, the better you will be able to unlock her work). She describes herself as &quot;nomadic&quot;, travelling between Macclesfield, where she grew up, and London. Most of the &quot;brute manoeuvring of materials&quot; gets done in Macclesfield. The &quot;condensed thinking&quot; happens on trains and the &quot;grappling with verbal stuff&quot; happens in London. She works with metal and wood, &quot;hard, lofty boys&apos; material&quot;, which she describes as &quot;unforgiving&quot; and also with clay which is &quot;relaxing and yielding&quot; – more feminine and spontaneous. In one of her wittiest pieces, three gorgeously entangled clay figures hobnob. They are animated but inconclusively human. The title is: Um, you mean we have to be serious now? .

Marten&apos;s aim is to produce a &quot;family of objects and ideas with some sort of circuitry&quot;. Wentworth says: &quot;She is making codes – her work is like a contemporary Rosetta stone. It is part of a broad conversation. She is enormously respected. She has a hidden grandeur but no grandiosity. And she has such wisdom… I can talk with her about how the world is made.&quot; Kate Kellaway 

CHARLOTTE MOTH chosen by TACITA DEAN


&apos;Her work feels like she&apos;s travelling, noticing and absorbing, and is not, for the time being, studio-bound or stuck to a particular place or orthodoxy,&quot; says Tacita Dean of her chosen artist, Charlotte Moth, before praising her &quot;eclectic use of materials&quot; and &quot;delicacy of touch&quot;.

Charlotte Moth&apos;s art has taken her all over Europe, but it was in her hometown, Bexhill-on-Sea, as a teenager that she had her first shiver of inspiration: walking past the De La Warr pavilion every Saturday on her way to work, she noted with curiosity the white Modernist hulk amid the old-world grandeur of the seaside resort.

Sixteen years on and Moth, 31, is still fascinated by the shapes and spaces around her, from apartment blocks to empty streets to striking interiors, but is now an established artist who draws on these photographic subjects as a sculptor draws on their material. She avoids restricting herself to one discipline – &quot;I always had a problem at art school because they made you choose departments&quot; – and her work takes in photography, sculpture and, occasionally, film, theatre and music: an exploration of space in all its aspects.

Moth shares with Dean an interest in analogue – Travelogue, her ever-growing collection of photographs of spaces such as hotel lobbies, seaside resorts and deserted offices is shot entirely on film – and an affection for continental Europe: Dean left Britain for Berlin in 2000, Slade graduate Moth has lived in Paris, &quot;on and off&quot; for the past four years. &quot;It&apos;s this idea of displacement that&apos;s really important,&quot; she says. &quot;When you&apos;re removed from something, then maybe you can look at it in a different way.&quot;

In ParisMost recently, Moth has been working on installations of a &quot;sculptural dialogue&quot; between two works – the one a shimmering curtain, the second a slide show behind the curtain. She also continues to add to Travelogue, in which images are stripped of all context: &quot;Someone who comes to see [them] might not have been at the De La Warr Pavilion but they might have been to a lido in Cornwall, for example, or some exotic place that feels the same. The sense of ambiguity is important because there are many readings an image can trigger.&quot; LD 

BJORN VENO chosen by YINKA SHONIBARE

Yinka Shonibare was initially drawn to Bjorn Veno&apos;s work because, while artists such as Tracey Emin, Cindy Sherman and Paula Rego are renowned for scrutinising the female self in their work, Veno seemed to be the only contemporary male artist doing the equivalent. &quot;I&apos;m older than him but maybe I&apos;m having my own mid-life crisis,&quot; Shonibare says, &quot;because I find his exploration of male identity very intriguing. He&apos;s very brave to expose himself like he does. It&apos;s not something I could do.&quot;

Captivated by tales of heroism as a child, 31-year-old Veno uses photography to explore his sense of disillusionment at the man he has become. &quot;I had this idea,&quot; he says at home in Rochester, Kent, &quot;that adults were in full control, a bit like James Bond or Indiana Jones. Suddenly I found I&apos;d become an adult and I was actually worse off. You have these perceptions of what it means to be an adult which you cannot live up to.&quot;

For the first chapter of Mann , his four part self-portrait series, Veno returned to his childhood home in Norway to photograph himself playing the games of his infancy: set within dark, haunting landscapes, Veno, often naked, looks pale and powerless. In one he crouches next to a Lego spaceship, his underpants round his ankles. Elsewhere he emerges limp and dripping from a lake, the opposite of a triumphant James Bond coming to shore. &quot;I find failure interesting,&quot; he says. &quot;As a man you&apos;re not supposed to fail.&quot; By the final chapter Veno is playing out his hero fantasies. In one shot he&apos;s a &quot;confident&quot; swaggering fisherman &quot;ready for a fight&quot;.

Shonibare also describes the &quot;odd&quot; quality that Veno&apos;s photographs have, something he works hard to achieve, particularly through lighting. For the &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; he works with his camera on timer and performs in character, selecting the final shots from hundreds. In the chapter Veno found the most cathartic, his mother and aunties were also required to react on camera to him &quot;in a bad state, hyperventilating, screaming&quot;. The resulting images are both moving and disturbing.

Veno has just started an MA in photography at the Royal College of Art and is represented by London&apos;s Nettie Horn gallery. It seems his study of failure is likely to bring him great success.&quot;He deserves to do well,&quot; Shonibare says. &quot;He has a vast body of work and is more rigorous and focused than so many of his contemporaries.&quot; IC 

KATIE PATERSON chosen by CORNELIA PARKER

Katie Paterson is an astronomical artist – in the fullest sense of the word. The sky is not the limit for her. It is a beginning. Her champion Cornelia Parker describes her as someone who can &quot;take you out of your realm … she is so original, engaging and expansive – I fell in love with her and her work. She makes us realise how inconsequential we are in relation to the universe.&quot; Her work has involved plotting a map of 27,000 dead stars, bouncing Beethoven&apos;s Moon light sonata off the moon in morse code and returning the results into a self-playing piano, making an electric light bulb that duplicates moon light.

More recently, she has become a connoisseur of darkness. In her beautiful, playful, fastidious The History of Darkness , she has catalogued and dated darkness with the help of telescopes – including the Keck telescope in Hawaii – the most powerful telescope in the world that can look back 13.2 billion light years. Questions that tease us out of thought obsess her: &quot;I like work on the brink of impossibility,&quot; she says. She loves immensity – and particularity. One of her works tells the story of a single grain of sand taken from the Sahara desert which, with the help of a nanotechnologist, was turned into the smallest grain imaginable (&quot;I like the idea that it is a sculpture&quot;) and then released back into the desert. &quot;The sand is smaller than a blood cell, as close to nothing as you can get but it still exists.&quot; Paterson&apos;s boyfriend photographed her, in black and white, returning the sand to the Sahara. &quot;I suddenly felt so sad,&quot; she said. It was to do with scale – the immensity of the desert and her almost invisible enterprise.

Paterson, 29, laughs as she talks about her work – and acknowledges that it is finely balanced between seriousness and play. She is a romantic (with the romantic&apos;s understanding of futility) and with the patience, curiosity and technical persistence of a scientist. Scientists champion her work: she has recently become University College London&apos;s first artist in residence in the department of physics and astronomy. She grew up in the western highlands of Scotland and studied at Edinburgh and the Slade, where her MA involved recording a melting glacier – a work that launched her career but is likely to prove just the tip of the iceberg.

 Using Iridium Flares for Parallax Measurements

 Back on October 8 I and some other people were fortunate to witness a bright Iridium flare near Jupiter. I got a nice shot from my camera (mounted on my telescope with the drive going to stop star trailing), and Dean Male from Black wood kindly sent me his image captured at the same time.

One thing that I noticed was that the image of the flare was slightly shifted with regard to the background stars. This represented a great opportunity to measure parallax in these images and do ... something.

 Parallax is the slight shift in a nearer object against a simultaneously viewed distant background object. Parallax is used to measure the distance to the Moon , the planets and the stars . Amateur photographers have used their images of the Moon and nearby stars to measure the distance of the Moon to within 3%. So could I use the parallax shift in the images of the flare to measure the height of the satellite?

 Highly sophisticated parallax measuring system. 

Well, I measured the separation of the trails, using the sophisticated method of scaling SkyMap charts to the same scale as the images at full resolution, and using a bit of paper to plot the flare location.

I came up with 36&apos; 57&quot;
separation, or 0.6158 degrees (about a Lunar Diameter). Using the formula used for Lunar parallax: and estimating that Largs and Black wood are roughly 25 km apart as the crow flies I get .... the iridium satellite was 2,326 Km up.

Which, as they orbit around 800 Km up, is a 300% error. I tried the formula out on the lunar separation measured here , and got the right result. Using the more complex formula:
 Where D is the distance to the object, b is the separation between observers and Theta is the angular separation between the two images with respect to the background stars gives the same result.

Either Dean and I were 8 Km apart or the flare images separation was 3 times larger than I measured (not likely) or I&apos;m doing something very wrong, or the formula is not appropriate for small separations of observers (The amateur Moon calculation was done from observers over 2000 Km apart, this won&apos;t work fro iridium flares which are only observed in a small area).

Anyone have any ideas?

FINALLY. We are FINALLY going to deal with Luna&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;hellip;right? RIGHT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Harry had not expected Hermione&apos;s anger to abate over night and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms). Ron became shamelessly cheery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually glad that Harry didn&amp;rsquo;t expect Hermione to be immediately cheery after what they&amp;rsquo;d gone through. But, as hard as it is for me to admit it, Hermione is kind of being&amp;hellip;slightly irritating. Again,&lt;strong&gt;ONLY SLIGHTLY&lt;/strong&gt;. I largely get why she is angry and why she&amp;rsquo;s acting the way she is. I guess I just wish&amp;hellip;that she would stop? Is it so bad that I just want them all to have hug parties and unicorn cupcakes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look,&lt;em&gt;I am an adult,&lt;strong&gt;you stop judging me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione&apos;s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious due, the recovery of Gryffindor&amp;rsquo;s sword, and above all, Ron&apos;s return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me smile, even though my literary counterpart is MAXIMUM SAD right now. In a novel as harrowing and dark as this has been, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take these moments of happiness when they come. And without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;... and how did you find out about the Taboo?&quot; he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The what?&quot; &quot;You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who&apos;s name!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, yeah, Well, it&apos;s just a bad habit we&apos;ve slipped into,&quot; said Harry. &quot;But I haven&apos;t got a problem calling him V ---&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;NO!&quot; roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, &quot;but the name&apos;s been jinxed, Harry, that&apos;s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance --- it&apos;s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because we used his&lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exactly! You&apos;ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they&apos;ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable --- quick-and-easy way to find Order members!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT&lt;/strong&gt;. Oh man, again, such a simple explanation that I never even remotely considered. Actually, I had completely forgotten about them being attacked off of Tottenham Court Road. I read back in chapter nine and there, on page 164, it sat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know what&amp;rsquo;s going on! Voldemort&amp;rsquo;s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, Rowling, you are a mad genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah...&quot; They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. &quot;Harry... you don&apos;t reckon it could&apos;ve been Dumbledore?&quot; &quot;Dumbledore what?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, &quot;Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean,&quot; Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, &quot;he had the real sword last, didn&apos;t he? Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dumbledore&amp;rsquo;s dead,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw it happen, I saw the body. He&apos;s definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ll additionally admit that this small passage put the possibility that Dumbledore was alive into my head. I quickly discounted the notion, though, because it&amp;rsquo;s absurd. I think, without some grand plan to completely absolve the pain everyone has gone through, I would be pretty mad at Rowling if she brought Dumbledore back. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes this series so unique to me: the risk is real, not imagined or just threatened, and Dumbledore represents the consequences of fighting oppression firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he did do that at all, I suppose. Oh, damn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I dunno,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Sometimes I&apos;ve thought, when I&apos;ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or --- or he just wanted to make it more difficult, But I don&apos;t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn&apos;t he? He -- well,&quot; Ron&apos;s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, &quot;he must&apos;ve known I&apos;d run out on you.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; Harry corrected him. &quot;He must&apos;ve known you&apos;d always want to come back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus. There go my heartstrings again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will say that, for the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m worried about Harry being so glad that Ron is back that the two of them will start making Hermione feel like Ron did before he left. And, because I feel like I need to preface these kind of statements everything, Hermione&amp;rsquo;s tantrum might&lt;strong&gt;THAT IS TOTALLY JUSTIFIED&lt;/strong&gt;seems to be set up to be a possible foil for our two male characters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO FAR. I will probably be wrong, but I just wanted to vomit a thought or two down before I forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOVING RIGHT ALONG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Harry looked down at the black thorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else&apos;s hand sewn to the end of his arm.&lt;p&gt;&quot;You just need to practice,&quot; said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. &quot;It&amp;rsquo;s all a matter of confidence Harry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she could take the black thorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I get to eat my words immediately upon committing them to the digital world. Harry, thank you for being the bigger person here amidst all the chaos and stress, not only because it&amp;rsquo;s a mature thing to do, but because I cannot handle any more tomfoolery from this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We need to talk,&quot; she said.&lt;p&gt;He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was&lt;em&gt;The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What?&quot; he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita&apos;s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione&apos;s answer however, was completely unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh shit, guys. Are we going to go to the Lovegood household???&lt;strong&gt;IS THIS ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said,&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s that mark, the mark in&lt;em&gt;Beedle the Bard&lt;/em&gt;. Look at this!&amp;rdquo; She thrust&lt;em&gt;The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore&lt;/em&gt;under Harry&amp;rsquo;s unwilling eyes and saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore&amp;rsquo;s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita&amp;rsquo;s invention.&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The signature,&amp;rdquo; said Hermione.&amp;ldquo;Look at the signature, Harry!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon&lt;em&gt;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Er&amp;ndash; what are you -- ?&amp;rdquo; said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It keeps cropping up, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; she said.&amp;ldquo;I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald&amp;rsquo;s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric&amp;rsquo;s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can&amp;rsquo;t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means&amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t even know whether Grindelwald&amp;rsquo;s still alive&amp;ndash; but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this is important, Harry!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s finally starting to come together. So much has happened since the wedding that I&amp;rsquo;d also forgotten about Xenophilius wearing the mark of Grindelwald. But&amp;hellip;why? Why was he wearing it and why is it in&lt;em&gt;Tales of Beetle The Bard&lt;/em&gt;and why is it also in the letter Dumbledore wrote Grindelwald and why was it ALSO on a grave in Godric&amp;rsquo;s Hollow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad Hermione brought this up and, despite how it appears to Harry, glad that Ron agrees with her that they need to go see Xenophilius Lovegood. Harry is probably partially right that Ron is doing it as a way to placate Hermione, but her idea isn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all. They&amp;rsquo;re at another dead end and Ron&amp;rsquo;s gift from Dumbledore proved worthy, so why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t Hermione&amp;rsquo;s? Obviously, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a stretch, but I suppose the entire thing is an absurd stretch once you start thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was kind of sad that when they traveled to find the Lovegood house, they came so close to the Burrow, but the atmosphere of terror that has become their daily lives prevented them from even visiting. It makes me wonder if Ginny and Mrs. Weasley are ok, and if the twins&amp;rsquo; shop is still doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aha!&amp;rdquo; shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky.&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s got to be Luna&amp;rsquo;s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that the Lovegood house is so odd. I&amp;rsquo;m glad we get the chance to let Rowling do her best (detailed description of micro environments) with the Lovegood house, both inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, seriously,&lt;em&gt;can I live here all the time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the stove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna&apos;s styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/em&gt;movie is in two parts and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be massively upset if the inside of the Lovegood house doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;strong&gt;I NEED TO SEE THIS ON FILM&lt;/strong&gt;. This description actually makes the house seem rather practical. Well, not the paint job, but the way everything is shaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they make their way upstairs to Xenophilius&amp;rsquo;s workshop, there&amp;rsquo;s a really strange moment with a&amp;hellip;well, a horn on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Mr. Lovegood - what&apos;s that?&quot;&lt;p&gt;See was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,&quot; said Xenophilius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No it isn&apos;t!&quot; said Hermione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hermione,&quot; muttered Harry, embarrassed, &quot;now&apos;s not the moment -&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But Harry, it&apos;s an Erumpent horn! It&apos;s a Class B Tradeable Material and it&apos;s an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How&apos;d you know it&apos;s an Erumpent horn?&quot; asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don&apos;t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, why does he have this SITTING ON HIS WALL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Crumple Horned Snorkack&quot; said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face,&amp;ldquo;is a shy and highly magical creature, and it&apos;s horn -&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that&apos;s an Erumpent horn and it&apos;s incredibly dangerous - I don&apos;t know where you got it-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I bought it,&quot; said Xenophilius dogmatically. &quot;Two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this going to be one of those minor details that becomes important later on? I think so. Unfortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t get any more elaboration on this horn because Harry asks Xenophilius for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Xenophilius, &quot;Help, Hmm.&quot;&lt;p&gt;His good eye moved again to Harry&apos;s scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...&quot; &quot;Aren&apos;t you the one who keeps telling everyone it&apos;s their first duty to help Harry?&quot; said Ron. &quot;In that magazine of yours?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touche, Ron. What gives, Mr. Lovegood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.&lt;p&gt;&quot;Er - yes, I have expressed that view. however -&quot; &quot;That&apos;s for everyone else to do, not you personally?&quot; said Ron. Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where&apos;s Luna?&quot; asked Hermione. &quot;Let&apos;s see what she thinks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, &quot;Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She...she will like to see you. I&apos;ll go and call her and then - yes, very well. I shall try to help you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close. They looked at each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t like this. I don&amp;rsquo;t like this at all. I&amp;rsquo;m glad Luna is going to show up (and hopefully in this chapter), but in the meantime, let&amp;rsquo;s appreciate a rather touching scene with Harry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur&apos;s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius&apos;s attitude proved that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I bet while Ron was gone, the Harry/Hermione shippers were having a field day with that part of the story, but I still think Ginny is best for Harry. And I kind of miss her feisty attitude around these parts. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenophilius returns, without Luna, though she is on her way back. (YAY I LOVE LUNDA&lt;strong&gt;FOREVER&lt;/strong&gt;.) And they finally get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Now,&quot; he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, &quot;how may I help you, Mr. Potter?&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, &quot;it&apos;s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur&apos;s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. &quot;Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME&lt;/strong&gt;. No way. NO WAY!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please please please please let the next chapter be about the Deathly Hallows&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;PLEASE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[/cut]&lt;/p&gt; 
 Bagged salad: press release before publishing a bad idea

In Sept. 2000, I called Procter&amp;Gamble to substantiate claims their consumer-oriented FIT Fruit and Vegetable Wash removed 99.9 per cent more residue and dirt than water alone.

The PR-thingies hooked me up with some scientists at P&amp;G in Cincinnati, who verbally told me that sample cucumbers, tomatoes and the like were grown on the same farm in California, sprayed with chemicals that would be used in conventional production, and then harvested immediately and washed with FIT or water. The FIT removed 99.9 per cent more, or so the company claimed.

One problem. Many of the chemicals used had harvest‑after dates, such as the one tomato chemical that must be applied at least 20 days before harvest. Residue data on produce in North American stores reveals extremely low levels, in the parts per million or billion. So that 99.9 per cent reduction was buying consumers an extra couple of zeros in the residue quantity, all well below health limits.

I also asked why the results hadn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and the P&amp;G types said it was an important advance that had to be made available to consumers as soon as possible, without the delays and messiness of peer-review.

Maybe Chiquita Brands, the owners of Fresh Express and also based in Cincinnati, are using the same PR flunkies as P&amp;G because the public relations around the new produce rinse – FreshRinse – is strikingly familiar and equally lame as FIT in 2000.

For the most part, pathogens and chemicals in fresh produce need to be controlled on the farm, and in transportation and distribution.

The new rinse, for use in the packing shed and which the company says removes microorganisms from leafy greens more effectively than conventional chlorine sanitizers , was unveiled yesterday at a news conference at the Produce Marketing Association Fresh Summit to gushing reviews.

Fernando Aguirre, Chiquita’s chairman and chief executive officer, said,

 &quot;Based on our extensive research, we are proud to introduce the biggest invention since the creation of prepackaged salads. ... Compare FreshRinse technology to current wash standards. Chlorine is the abacus and FreshRinse is the iPad. An abacus is what people use with the beads, a great thing at the time, just like chlorine rinse was. We believe FreshRinse sets a new standard in food safety.” 

Also jumping aboard the metaphor train, Mike Burness, vice president of global quality and food safety said,

 “As a matter of magnitude, that’s the equivalent of chlorine walking a mile and FreshRinse making two round trips to the moon . If chlorine walked one mile, FreshRinse would have walked a marathon. We have seen a significant reduction of potential foodborne organisms that cause disease.” 

Scientific advisors who gave more qualified endorsements included project advisor Dr. Michael Osterholm, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota, Dr. David Acheson, managing director of food and import safety for Leavitt Partners and the former the Food and Drug Administration associate commissioner for food protection and chief medical officer, and Dr. Robert Buchanan, director and professor, University of Maryland Center for Food Safety&amp;Security Systems.

Did any of you esteemed science types say to Fresh Express, we should publish these results in a peer-reviewed journal first, because that’s the way this credibility thing works?

I told Ilan Brat of the Wall Street Journal yesterday that I couldn’t judge whether the new wash worked better or not without publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Fresh Express had three recalls of its bagged salads this year, and was the source of a Salmonella typhirmirium outbreak that sickened eight people in May, but decided it wasn’t worth telling anyone about it .

Metaphor-man Burness, told the Journal the company chose to market the product before submitting supporting research for publication in peer-reviewed journals because &quot;anything that advances food safety, we believe we need to leverage that for our consumers.&quot; 

Sounds familiar.

He added that the company plans to submit its research to the Journal of Food Protection by the end of the year.

Dude, I’ve got a bunch of graduate students who say they have papers they are going to prepare for the Journal of Food Protection. I have about a dozen in my head too. Except that doesn’t count for shit.

If the company had instead spent the time it used coming up with terrible risk communication metaphors preparing the results for publication, they would at least have a paper submitted. Until then, I’m thinking cold fusion.

 &quot;All this data is nice—why isn&apos;t it published in a peer-reviewed journal?&quot; Powell said. 

 Still, he added, &quot;if it does what it says it can do, that would be important, because it would be an additional tool to lower the risk&quot; that eating salad greens could cause outbreaks of disease. 

Fresh Express, you’re an industry leader and this year’s winner of the International Association for Food Protection’s Black Pearl award for food safety leadership. But I don’t get this. I’m all for marketing food safety, but with a strong caveat: be able to back it up.

Kevin Spacy and Anil Kapoor, both are 51 years old. But while Kevin is comfortable with his age and receding hairline, Anil Kapoor is insecure and has to use a lot of cosmetics to preserve his Tezaab (1988) looks, especially the hairdo. And this not only on silver screen but offscreen as well. This is because the film industry and society where Kevin lives gives equal importance and has meaty roles for all age groups. While Anil is not lucky enough to be allowed to live and act his age. He lives in a time and place where premium is attached to appearance and youth and the film industry has lead (and remunerative) roles only for the young looking. Jackie Shroff (53) couldn’t keep fit and young enough to retain his Ram Lakhan (1989) looks so he has lagged far behind Anil. On the other hand Tom Hanks (54) and John Travolta (56) happen to be in Hollywood and can carry big hits on their shoulders even without trying to look younger than their age.

In Bollywood, once a male star crosses 50 and starts looking his age, especially if he doesn’t wear full crop of  black hairs, he is done and dusted with. Amitabh Bacchan is an striking example. Apart from charisma, the 68 years old Amitabh has to have a full crop of enviable black hairs groomed in his 80s style in order to remain as a star in the marketplace. Similarly a 45 years old Shahrukh has to look, prance and frolic like his mid 20s and do similar roles; a balding Salman Khan, Akshay Khanna and Sanjay Dutt has to undergo hair weaving and had to laboriously cover bald patches prior to that (though not like Rajat Sharma of ‘aap ki adalat’). And above all, these 40+ actors have to invariably romance a teenager in order to prove that they are still young. Poor chaps have to force fit themselves into youth roles since the roles of their age are not available. And if at all there is an occassional romance or action role for an old actor, it has to fall on the superstar power of a black haired, tall and strong looking Amitabh (Nishabd, Chini Kum, baghban, Khaki, Eklavya etc). Could someone in bollywood dare to make a Chini Kum with Om Puri(60) or Naseeruddin Shah(60)? These talented actors cannot play anything but ‘character’ roles since they lack the cosmetic traits of heavy baritone and full shiny crop of black hairs. And the bald Anupam Kher (55) is relegated to playing mostly comic sidekicks. This is no way to take away from the acting abilities of Amitabh. He has proven talent. Just that he has a cosmetic edge over equally or more talented actors of similar age and this keeps his stocks high.

Consider Clint Eastwood (80), Dharmendra (75) and Dilip Kumar (88) of similar age band. While Clint’s career as a director and even lead actor is still robust, Dharmendra and Dilip Kumar have not only lost into oblivion but have become fodder for stand up mimics in laughter challenge shows. Similarly while Donald Sutherland (75), Anthony Hopkins (73), Jack Nicholson (73), Al Pacino (70) and Ben Kingsley (67) are still prolific stars on silver screen, Rajesh Khanna (68), Vinod Khanna (64) and Shatrughan Sinha (64) had to shift careers to politics and gloat in the silver screen success of their son in law/son/daughter. And Shashi Kapoor (72) ‘blew’ out of proportion and out of sight a la all food loving Kapoors. George Clooney (49) is perfectly fine with white streaks while Sanjay Dutt(51) is not. Rajnikanth (61) has to wear a wig and plaster youth on his face to stay in action while a Bruce Willis (55) can be an action star with the full display of his bald pate and wrinkles on his face. Now compare the latter with Alok Nath (54) who is equally bald but not equally lucky. So Alok has to settle for playing father to the lead actor/actresses for past two decades while Bruce can still give Salmans and Akshays a run for their money when it comes to action. Because we Indians cannot see Alok Nath in ‘Die Hard’ or ‘Jackal’ roles unless he puts a wig. In fact we wouldn’t mind him play Bruce’s father. Suny Deol (54) was a hope till a decade back but he too is now out of the race. Fortunately Nana Patekar (59) and Paresh Rawal (60) have managed to stay in the race with some niche/comic roles due to their unique styles. Dev Anand (87) of bollywood manages to be called evergreen for his looks and fitness. He tried making movies in old age but couldn’t impress like Clint Eastwood.

For the womenfolk of Bollywood, things are more depressing. First of all, the movies here are predominantly male centric and the females are given young glam doll roles. So it is logical for a Sonam, Mamta Kulkarni, Karishma Kapoor or Shilpa Shetty to fade out of silver screen once they crossed 30. However, when talented silver linings like Madhuri Dikshit, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Sri Devi are forced out of lead roles in their mid 30s and eventually forced away from silver screen, it is a loss to cinema. All this because they were no more fit to dance around with actors who were just marginally older than themselves and above all they were married (another let down in bollywood). These ladies knew this well and ‘quitted gracefully’ while still in their prime. But in effect, they were pushed out by societal preferances.  Aishwarya Rai (37), during her premarital days, had played on beauty queen tag and demureness. So she tasted success in damsel in distress roles. After marriage, she still gets mediocre eye-candy roles because she manages to look young and beautiful while Sushmita Sen (35) gets occassional slapstick bimbo roles due to a different persona even when she remains single. She is no match for Angelina Jolie and Drew Barrymore who are also 35. The limelight is hogged by Katrinas, Karinas and Priyankas who are milching their looks and youth to the hilt before they fade away of age. If they knew there would be a space for them till late, they would be very choosy in their roles now and we would be saved from ‘Pyar Impossible’ and ‘Singh is King’.

Hollywood actresses like Renee Zellweger (41), Jennifer Aniston (41),Julia Roberts (43), Nicole Kidman (43) and Sandra Bullock(46) are still in their prime. Compare them with Tabu(40) of India who is unmarried and talented. She gets few niche roles once in a blue moon . Once she starts looking older,even those will stop coming. Then she’ll have to wait for about a decade to do ‘mother’ roles like Rima Lagu since there are no plum roles for females in late 40s in Bollywood. They wish they would be lucky like Judie Foster (48), Diane Keaton (64), Susan Sarandon (64) and Michelle Pfeiffer (52) who can still have meaty lead roles written for them. If the latter were in Bollywood, they would be playing only supporting roles like Kiron Kher.

The problem seems like a chicken and egg one. Either its the bollywood filmmakers who cannot think of genres beyond romance and action and dependence on youth OR it is our society who can relate heroic traits only with youth and thereby force the filmmakers to make films in those limited genres. Both ways its a toll on cinema variety and quality. Its time we Indians become comfortable with ageing heroes and give them a chance to play the lead without wigs. We need more Boman Iranis (51) and Mohan Lals (50) who can play their own age without feeling insecure. This is how quality performance comes.

The Minnesota native also confirmed that he and the New Power Generation would also perform nightly alongside featured acts.

&quot;If you&apos;ve been to one of my shows, then you know what time it is,&quot; the usually media shy artist joked. &quot;You need to come early and come often because every time we play it&apos;s always something new. I got a lot of hits. Bring friends, bring children, and bring foot spray because it&apos;s gonna be funky.&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t want to talk too much but how many have seen &apos;Waiting for Superman,&apos; &quot; he asked before bringing out Harlem Children&apos;s Zone head Geoffrey Canada who also spoke briefly about how grateful he is Prince chose Harlem as the venue to announce the series. 

Prince will play a special guitar for the duration of the concert series and then auction off the guitar for the benefit of Harlem Children&apos;s Zone.

BET&apos;s President of Music Programming Stephen Hill , a long-time fan of &apos;The Purple One,&apos; introduced Prince to the throngs of media outlets present at the press conference. A few months back, the network awarded Prince with a Lifetime Achievement award at the 2010 BET Awards.

Hill reminisced on his first Prince concert in 1982 at the Apollo and more recently flying to Nice, France to see his two-hour set and another two-hour long after-hours set. &quot;I know what I hope he&apos;s here to announce,&quot; but admitted he was out of the loop on what the big announcement was.

At the press conference, Prince also debuted the full version of his new song &apos;Rich Friends.&apos;

Earlier this year, he released his album &apos;20Ten&apos; in newspapers across Europe and in the UK, but refused to allow access to the album to digital download services.

Prince Through The Years

 &apos;My Name Is Prince&apos; 
In 1984, the Minneapolis-based rock&amp;soul superstar known as Prince made a striking film debut in the Warner Bros. movie &apos;Purple Rain.&apos; Loosely based on the &apos;I Wanna Be Your Lover&apos; singer&apos;s rise to fame, the Albert Magnoli -helmed film has had an everlasting effect on music and movie lovers alike. In celebration of &apos;Purple Rain&apos;s 25th anniversary, Black Voices.com pays homage to the man behind the genius throughout the years.

 Purple Reign 
Not only did the soundtrack to the film &apos;Purple Rain&apos; spend 24 weeks atop the charts, but it also earned Prince an Academy Award for best original score. &apos;Purple Rain&apos; sold more than 13 million copies and was the first project Prince recorded with his longtime band, the Revolution. The title track took home the 1985 Grammy for best group rock vocal; other hit singles included &apos;When Doves Cry,&apos; &apos;I Would Die 4 U,&apos; and &apos;Let&apos;s Go Crazy.&apos; The landmark album made Prince a household name.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Pop Life&apos; 
 Prince Rogers Nelson , the son of a jazz singer and a pianist songwriter, was born and raised in Minneapolis. Prince taught himself how to play piano, guitar and drums - all before the age of 14. He released his debut, &apos;For You,&apos; in 1978, but it wasn&apos;t until 1980 that this eclectic singer-songwriter began making a name for himself with his second release, &apos;Dirty Mind.&apos; The sexually explicit material included a very suggestive track about oral sex called &apos;Head.&apos;

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Sign O&apos; the Times&apos; 
For two shows at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Prince found himself in the lucky position of opening up for the Rolling Stones . Unfortunately, his style choices got the young singer booed off the stage. Nevertheless, his &apos;Controversy&apos; album (released later that year), coupled with his side projects with the funk band The Time, fueled the singer&apos;s popularity both stateside in addition to internationally.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Money Don&apos;t Matter Tonight&apos; 
Prince has never been an artist consumed by celebrity or making money. At the height of his fame, he still managed to incorporate socially conscious records with MTV-friendly videos like &apos;Little Red Corvette&apos; and &apos;Delirious.&apos; One song in particular, &apos;Sister,&apos; broached the topic of incest. His 1982 double disc &apos;1999&apos; sold more than 3 million copies.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Get Off&apos; 
Early in his career, Prince opened for Rick James on the singer&apos;s 1981 tour. In his autobiography, &apos;The Confessions of Rick James: Memoirs of a Superfreak,&apos; James charged that Prince copied his stage act and performed it before he could take the stage. Loyal fans say that Prince&apos;s performance, which included peeling off his stockings and throwing them at the audience before stripping down to his underwear while gyrating and stimulating oral sex, won the newcomer fans over the funk music legend.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Scandalous&apos; 
Prince has always had tons of band lineup changes, especially with females. On his first tour, he replaced his keyboardist, Gayle Chapman , with Lisa Coleman . His Revolution girls, Wendy and Lisa , were replaced by Sheila E, with whom he still tours. He then created the New Power Generation and hired new guitarist Levi Spencer . Mostly, though, he allowed his band members to give their input to whatever music he was working on at the time.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Under the Cherry Moon &apos; 
The panned romance movie &apos;Under the Cherry Moon &apos; starred Prince as a gigolo named Chris who falls in love with an heiress. The 1986 film, which Prince also directed, was shot in Nice, France. Although the film bombed, the soundtrack yielded his hit song &apos;Kiss.&apos;

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Sexy M.F.&apos; 
Throughout his career, Prince has been a flamboyant, attention-grabbing singer, thanks in part to his on-stage outfits. This seven-time Grammy Award winner has never steered away from causing up a stir with his controversial clothes, which at one time included bottomless pants, high-heel shoes and black bikini briefs. Fans have come to expect the unexpected from Prince.

 Prince Through The Years 

 &apos;Adore&apos; 
Over the years, Prince has been fortunate to count some of today&apos;s biggest singers as fans, friends and collaborators. Not only did he write, produce and provide vocals for a majority of The Time &apos;s music, but he also helmed an album for Paisley Park signee Mavis Staple . Vanity 6 and Sheila E were among his protégés, and, at one point, both were members of his backing band. Prince was rumored to be romantically linked to several starlets, including Madonna, who enlisted the singer to write the single &apos;Love Song,&apos; for her &apos;Like a Prayer&apos; album. Prince managed to have an equally successful career penning songs for other big-name acts, such as Chaka Khan &apos;s &apos;I Feel for You&apos; and Sinead O&apos;Connor &apos;s &apos;Nothing Compares to You.&apos; Khan, like Prince, was fed up with her label, Warner Bros., and reached out to Prince to help plan her departure. When she was freed from her contract, Khan agreed to let Prince helm her &apos;Come to My House&apos; album, which was released through his NPG imprint.

 Smalto usato: Thanks so Muchness!


 Descrizione dell&apos;abbinamento smalto/accessorio: 
Ispirandomi ad Alice in Wonderland, collezione a cui appartiene questo smalto, &quot;Thanks so Muchness!&quot;, ho voluto organizzare anch&apos;io un Tea Party nel mio giardino invitando delle farfalline.
Inoltre lo stile retrò-moderno del mio bracciale Le Chou Chou si sposa perfettamente con il colore dello smalto, un classico rosso acceso ma shimmer e con una punta di magenta, che quasi trasforma le mie unghie in brillanti petali.

Descrizione dell&apos;abbinamento smalto/accessorio: 

Ho utilizzato lo smalto della collezione Hong Kong, PEARL OF WISDOM, e l&apos;ho abbinato alla collana di perle di mia mamma.

Lo smalto OPI contribuisce a dare un tocco di stile.
Nonostante io ami gli smalti molto colorati, pearl of wisdom mi ha conquistata.

 Descrizione dell&apos;abbinamento smalto/accessorio: 

Ed ecco come promesso la mia versione&quot;summer&quot; di Jade is the new black ! Credo che mischiato al bianco, tinta chiara e quindi estiva per eccellenza, questa tinta di verde assuma sfumature di colore e gradazioni molto belle! Ho scelto di abbinarle poi ad un accessorio anch&apos;esso estivo x eccellenza...i miei nuovi sandali! Che manco a farlo apposta richiamano la stessa tonalità dello smalto e sono belli&quot;variegati&quot;come le mie unghiette!:) Insomma questo colore si dimostra essere adatto per ogni stagione...e questa manicure rispecchia pienamente la mia&quot;filosofia&quot;in fatto di smalti...e cioè che ogni decoro,anche il più complesso o&quot;appariscente&quot;può essere delicato e non volgare se portato in modo fine.

 Smalto usato: OPI DS Reserve/OPI Baby it&apos;s &apos;coal&apos; outside

 Descrizione dell&apos;abbinamento smalto/accessorio: 

Per questa manicure mi sono ispirata a un pezzo di abbigliamento intimo: il bustier! Questo in particolare è il mio preferito perchè, pur essendo un capo molto sexy, con il colore rosa e il pizzo diventa delicato e femminile!
Dopo aver steso una base color cipria ho usato OPI DS Reserve per stampare una leggerissima rete un tono più scura ed iridescente che si intravedesse appena. Poi, con OPI Baby it&apos;s &apos;coal&apos; outside ho stampato un pizzo sulla punta dell&apos;unghia e una rosa alla base. Spero vi piaccia!

Smalto usato: OPI DS PASSION


 Descrizione dell&apos;abbinamento smalto/accessorio: 

Ho deciso di utilizzare questo smalto perchè appena arrivato (e utilizzato) è diventato il mio preferito.
Non credo possa esistere uno smalto più estivo. Alla luce diffusa risulta di un rosa scuro con tanti bellissimi microbrillantini rosa acceso e argento. Appena la luce diventa più intensa o è diretta, questo smalto cambia completamente tipologia. I microglitterini rosa diventano del colore dell&apos;arcobaleno che, con lo sfondo rosa scuro, danno un effetto tridimensionale. Assolutamente fantastico per il mare per avere una sferzata di colore in spiaggia e utilissimo per la sera per la sua eleganza e brillantezza. Uno smalto unico davvero.
L&apos;ho abbinato, appunto, ai miei accessori per il mare. Il mio telo, il mio costume preferito, la mia crema solare, gli occhialini per nuotare liberamente e i miei occhiali da sole. Cosa chiedere di più?

As a broken Senate failed America&apos;s children by not passing legislation that would prevent mass teacher layoffs, politicians in another committee room held a hearing on oversight of the for-profit college industry. Many of the same rhetorical points from the argument over K-12 reform were brandished in that hearing as well.

The rapid expansion of privatization in education is the overwhelming trend at all levels. &quot;While enrollment at institutions of higher education increased by 31 percent from 1998 to 2008, the number of students entering for-profit schools soared 225 percent over the same period.&quot;

This explosive growth of for-profit higher education is being likened to the housing bubble and the unscrupulous profiteering by the home mortgage industry that recently wreaked havoc on our economy:

 &quot;Steven Eisman, portfolio manager of the FrontPoint Financial Services Fund who has studied how the for-profit education industry operates and derives its revenue, did not mince words in his testimony. &apos;Until recently, I thought that there would never again be an opportunity to be involved with an industry as socially destructive as the subprime- mortgage industry. I was wrong. The for-profit education industry has proven equal to the task,&apos; he said. &apos;It is my hope that this administration sees the nature of the problem and begins to act now. But if nothing is done, then we are on the cusp of a new social disaster.&apos;
Eisman testified that the for-profit industry has grown at an extreme and unusual rate, driven by easy access to government-sponsored debt in the form of Title IV student loans, where the credit is guaranteed by the government. Thus, the government, the students, and the taxpayer bear all the risk and the for-profit industry reaps all the rewards, he said. When the Bush administration took over the reigns of government, the Department of Education gutted many of the rules that governed the conduct of this industry, he said. Once the floodgates were opened, the industry embarked on 10 years of unrestricted massive growth. Federal dollars flowing to the industry exploded to over $21 billion, a 450 percent increase.&quot; 
On the K-12 side, the same Wall Street operators who recently sent our economy into oblivion are now amassing huge amounts of wealth behind the charter school industry. The reason: 

 &quot;There are about 5000 charter schools in place now at about 4% of the total public school system in the United States and it&apos;s grown at about 400-500 units per year, which is about a $2 billion dollar annual investment opportunity set. So it&apos;s a very big and high growth category that is going to continue to represent opportunities . . .&quot; 
Perfectly symbolic of this &quot;partnership&quot; between public schools and the private sector was the recent announcement that former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings will now be working for America&apos;s most prominent and well-funded lobbyist for big business, The US Chamber of Commerce.

Meanwhile Diane Ravitch, one of the most well-known and outspoken critics of the Obama administration&apos;s education policies, reported on having her say in DC and at the Whitehouse. Her conclusion:

 &quot;Living outside the Beltway, I am struck by the fact that the education think tanks in DC are like an echo chamber. Almost all share the &apos;consensus,&apos; and because they agree with one another, they think they are right. The Obama administration bought into that consensus, and seems utterly tone-deaf to how their agenda is received outside the Beltway.&quot; 
The frustration that educators are feeling at the tone-deafness of the political debate in DC is palpable , impassioned , and pervasive :

 &quot;It is really interesting to me that President Obama can let BP take the lead in cleaning up the disaster in the Gulf, and yet teachers have got hedge fund managers, mayors, think tank policy wonks, billionaire vulture capitalists, and no real education experts , calling the shots on public school &apos;reform,&apos; with Arne Duncan as department head, whose teaching experience comes from volunteering at his mom&apos;s after school program (He actually says this, as if it means something!) . . .&quot; 
 (emphasis not added) 
It&apos;s not just educators either. Parents don&apos;t like Sec. Duncan&apos;s &quot;overly disruptive&quot; turnaround models that rely on closing schools and firing teachers. Christian churches are appalled at &quot;the administration&apos;s effort to push states to increase the number of charter schools, its plan to turn some of the federal money used to help poor children into competitive grants, its punitive approach to dealing with low-performing schools, and the &apos;ugly&apos; demonization of public school teachers.&quot; (h/t FunkyGal) 

Yet so little pushback against the Washington DC Consensus on education reform is registering among politicians. Even the most progressive Democrats in Congress have mustered an opposition that can be characterized as mild at best.

So one wonders why the messages about the Obama administration&apos;s education policies aren&apos;t getting through - not just to the politicians, but also to the media, the progressive blogosphere , and even bloggers in the education industry .

True, there are fundamental structures standing in the way of ordinary people getting their voices heard in our corporate-media dominated society. But that set of circumstances does not absolve one from straining harder and striving harder to get better at being heard above the fray.

It&apos;s also true that it&apos;s not that unusual for professionals in a specific discipline to feel that their voice isn&apos;t being heard. For instance, doctors and nurses frequently complained that their voices weren&apos;t being heard in the recent debate over health care reform. But the scale at which educators are being ignored in the Obama administration&apos;s education agenda is truly off-the-charts. And no one in the Democratic Party ever went after the American Medical Association with the vehemence that teachers&apos; unions are being vilified in the debate over education policy. So what gives?

It&apos;s not that educators aren&apos;t able and articulate advocates for their side. And people voicing their discontent with President Obama&apos;s education policies certainly know what they&apos;re talking about. But it could be that &quot;knowing what they&apos;re talking about&quot; may in fact may be part of the problem.
In the book Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die , authors Chip Heath and Dan Heath explain that many worthwhile causes and professional disciplines get shot-changed in our society because of the way in which people communicate those ideas and causes. Often, the people who feel most passionate about these ideas and causes are people who are the most knowledgeable about the subject matter and that can in effect be a handicap to their ability to communicate about these ideas and causes. The Heath brothers call this handicap The Curse of Knowledge.

From the site 37 Signals :
&quot;Lots of research in economics and psychology shows that when we know something, it becomes hard for us to imagine not knowing it. As a result, we become lousy communicators&quot; about it.

The Heath brothers point out, in this excerpt , that &quot;some ideas are inherently interesting and some are inherently uninteresting,&quot; and if you happen to get stuck with an inherently uninteresting idea - like, oh, pedagogy or curriculum - then you&apos;ve got a fundamental communication obstacle to overcome.

 &quot;Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has &apos;cursed&apos; us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can&apos;t readily re-create our listeners&apos; state of mind.&quot; 
So at the most fundamental level, the Heaths contend, being well informed can actually make it more difficult for you to make your point.

When it comes to the debate about education reform, educators are often afflicted with The Curse of Knowledge. Take the issue of high-stakes standardized testing. When President George W. Bush made high-stakes standardized testing the cornerstone of NCLB legislation, educators noted that this would inevitably lead to teachers &quot;teaching to the test&quot; rather than pursuing the goals of a broad and diverse curriculum. Bush famously countered that there was nothing wrong with teaching to the test &quot;if it was a good enough test.&quot;

While Bush&apos;s counterpoint seems reasonable, anyone who knows about education assessment knows that he is spouting nonsense here. But how to convey the more accurate and nuanced argument for balanced assessment? Here&apos;s one of the most knowledgeable people on assessment, Monty Neil :

 &quot;A healthy assessment and evaluation system would include three key components: limited large-scale standardized testing; extensive school-based evidence of learning; and a school-quality-review process.&quot; 
Right off the bat Neil&apos;s lingo goes over most people&apos;s heads when he includes both words &quot;assessment&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; in his comment. While he and most educators understand that those when it comes to evaluating students, teachers,and schools, those two words mean two very distinct and different things. But do most people know or even care about that?

 Here&apos;s an ordinary teacher blogging recently at Education Week about the folly of high-stakes standardized testing:

 &quot;We pre-test before kindergarten. We test and sort first graders into reading groups. We screen them for giftedness, verbal precocity and creativity. We introduce the Terra Nova. And then, the tests that really matter begin. The funny thing is--the test winners aren&apos;t always the life winners.
We start devaluing things that can&apos;t be tested--or promoting ideas or competencies in hopes that they&apos;ll boost achievement data. It&apos;s as if the grade or the score were a real thing, and the conceptual knowledge or skill merely a way to enhance the measurements.&quot; 
Okay, I understand and completely agree with the point. But will any message based on terms completely uncommon to the vernacular - &quot;pre-test,&quot; &quot;giftednesss,&quot; &quot;verbal precocity,&quot; and that&apos;s just the first sentence - resonate in a broad discussion?

To be fair, both of these examples come from the education press, where educators are writing for an education audience. But that&apos;s part of the problem, isn&apos;t it? If one spends most of one&apos;s time in conversation with a narrowly defined constituency, then that is bound to end up whittling the vocabulary of the discussion into ever more complicated and sophisticated terminology.

Here, for instance is another educator writing critically about education reform, this time at the Washington Post about the stupidity of teacher merit pay:

 &quot;Ensuring that every young person learns means constant reassessment of the curriculum, multiple measures of student achievement, and support systems throughout the school.&quot; 
Again, I agree completely. But I don&apos;t see any prospect of policy discussions rallying around the flag of &quot;multiple measures.&quot;

In yet another example, but of a slightly different bent, there&apos;s the discussion about the supposed effectiveness of charter schools. Earlier this week a new study showing the apparent success of KIPP charter schools was released to the great joy of the ed reform enthusiasts such as the Center for American Progress .

 &quot;At about half the KIPP schools, the study found that the gains in math for students after three years in the schools were equivalent of 1.2 years of extra instruction, and .9 years of additional instruction in reading
On average, the report says, KIPP middle schools have students who are more likely to be living in poverty and are more likely to be black or Hispanic than are students from the schools around them. Back when they were in 4th grade, the study also found, a majority of the KIPP middle school students had lower test scores on average than did students in their local school districts.&quot; 
People who know something about education were quick to discredit the study based on a number of factors. First, the study showed that KIPP middle schools are much less likely to enroll special education students and students with limited English skills than the school districts from which they draw. In other words, KIPP schools tend to avoid teaching some students who are the most difficult to teach. Second, as this press release points out,

 &quot;The KIPP study&apos;s description of attrition only considers half the equation, when comparing KIPP schools to matched traditional public schools. The researchers looked at the attrition rates, which they found to be similar - in the sense of the number of students departing from schools. But they never considered the receiving or intake rate. Even though the researchers agree that the students who are mobile are lower performing, they do not take into account the reality that KIPP schools do not generally receive these students.&quot; 
All well and good. But see how quickly a discussion about charter schools descends into a morass of complexity?

Chicago charter schools were also hailed as a great success story in an article the other day in this NYT article which reported that students attending charter schools were more apt to get accepted to college. Here again, read the fine print:

 &quot;First, as is the case with all Chicago public schools, college enrollment rates look only at graduating seniors who enroll in college and do not include students who dropped out or transferred to other high schools.
For example, there were 158 students in Shantell&apos;s freshman class at the Chicago International Charter Schools&apos; Ralph Ellison campus. At his graduation from the South Side school, there were 92.
&apos;Clearly, you&apos;re talking about selective retention,&apos; said Barbara Radner, director of the Center for Urban Education at DePaul University.
Ms. Radner said she also worried that many schools - not just chartered ones - were becoming sophisticated about getting students into college but then were not helping them to succeed at the next level.
&apos;Are we preparing kids for college or are we preparing kids to be accepted to college?&apos; she asked.&quot; 
[Hmmm, wonder how many of these college-bound students have been accepted at for-profit institutions?]
Great points all. But again, into the morass we go.

Back to the Heath brothers: &quot;Is it possible to make a true, worthwhile idea circulate as effectively as this false idea?&quot; They conclude &quot;yes&quot; and point to a few examples including President John F. Kennedy:
&quot;JFK dodged the Curse [with &quot;put a man on the moon in a decade&quot;]. If he&apos;d been a modern-day politician or CEO, he&apos;d probably have said, &quot;Our mission is to become the international leader in the space industry, using our capacity for technological innovation to build a bridge towards humanity&apos;s future.&quot; That might have set a moon walk back fifteen years.&quot;

So educators and advocates for progressive education everywhere (myself included), let&apos;s get out of the comfort zone of our conversation about education and challenge ourselves to do a better job of creating messages about progressive education that stick.

 Editorial Note: Like many well-deserving teachers, and unlike the dunderheads steering the Obama administration&apos;s education policies, the Duncehat Award is taking the summer months off.
