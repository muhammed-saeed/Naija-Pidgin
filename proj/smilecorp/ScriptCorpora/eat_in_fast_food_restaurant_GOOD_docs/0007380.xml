WE HAVE A FUTURE

By Vanesa Sutherland



From the Editor: When I interviewed Vanesa Sutherland, I
found her to be extremely knowlegable about pancreas and kidney
transplant. Mrs. Sutherland has experienced some of the
complications of diabetes, and will explain her organ transplant. 
Here&apos;s what she says:



Every time I consider my experience with diabetes, I see two
open ends of my life, and a perpetual question. Neither the
beginning (the diagnosis), or the end (the pancreas transplant)
are closed points. As time goes by, and medicine finds more
answers and explanation for both diabetes and transplantation, I
am able to look in a different way at the same facts. As for the
perpetual question, &quot;Did you really take care properly of your
diabetes/transplant?&quot; -- I think I did, many times; it did escape
from my hands at other times, but I always tried.



We were living in Mexico City at the time I was diagnosed. 
It did not come as a total surprise; a year before, when we were
in Colorado, my blood sugar test came back abnormally low. Now,
it was ostensibly high -- but as I still had positive c-peptide
levels, the physician put me on oral hypoglycemic medication. A
year after that, at age five, I was in a pediatric hospital in
Mexico, dehydrated, and in a typical diabetic coma. That year,
1969, I started insulin. With no known family history of diabetes
type 1, and no understanding of autoimmunity or the possible
triggers of autoimmunity, my parents and younger brother and
sister became a &quot;diabetic family.&quot;



It was not easy growing up with diabetes. I wanted to be
like my peers; but many of my teachers were aware of the diabetes
and kept a good eye on me, to the point that in elementary
school, my physical education teacher kept me from doing sports,
to avoid hypoglycemia. Understandably, I was not very thrilled
to share that I was diabetic, for fear I&apos;d be treated
differently, or prevented from the activities everybody else had
access to. So diabetes became something I tried to keep to
myself. But it was impossible; everybody around me knew. I am so
happy things are more open now, and people in general have a
better understanding.



We moved to Puerto Rico, and adolescence came, with its
pulsating hormones making diabetes harder to control. Lows and
highs were common, and the frustration of trying to stay in the
normal glucose range I tried to offset with excelling as a
student and a friend, seeking the company of people with whom I
did not need to preamble as a diabetic. So that was my
perception.



Back in Mexico, I went to college, did my graduate degree
and work, with more ups than downs with respect to diabetes. I
followed the changes in dietary and insulin treatment proposed by
many endocrinologists, from the typical diabetic diet to eating
normally, to adjusting my insulin, to treating complex
carbohydrates as a &quot;privileged&quot; food; from urine sugar tests to
several blood tests, to just two blood tests; from one daily
insulin injection to one of NPH adjusted by R insulin, or just R
with meals.



For several years, every time I injected myself, part of the
insulin (who knows how much?) went out of my skin. Later on I was
told that I had developed antibodies to the beef and pork from
which those insulins derived.



I have in the back of my mind a faint impression of
preparing for a test, and hearing in the news about pancreas
transplantation -- while the University of Minnesota&apos;s aerial
profile showed up on the TV, and a reporter emphasized the
shortcomings of such a big surgery and a life on
immunosuppression. I recalled thinking: &quot;I am not there yet, and
they are not yet there, either.&quot; Little I knew that some years
after, I would need the University Hospital, need the publicized
procedure, and I would call Minnesota home.



Less than nine years later, I found myself flying to New
York, to meet my mother, and to have a bilateral vitrectomy.
Things did not go as expected; I lost depth perception and a
great deal of visual acuity. With time and eye exercises, I have
gained some back, but some is lost.



At age 27 I was back with my very supportive parents in
Puerto Rico, after quitting a wonderful, fulfilling job, my
apartment, my friends and the boyfriend I thought I would marry
someday. I spent long hours trying to see better, trying to read,
making a word of fragmented letters. My parents and family
helped me, and my ability to read was regained. I lost some
vision but I still work on my standard computer and enjoy reading
and traveling .



Five years after my vision problems, my kidneys failed. I
found myself on dialysis, desperately trying to control my blood
sugar. Useless were the several graphs and tables depicting food
consumed, insulin taken and blood sugars; the endocrinologist
just shook her head and told me again, &quot;I do not know what to do
with you.&quot; Not that I had not heard that before, but now I was
on dialysis and my idea of having some worthwhile future was
vanishing despite my best efforts, despite my best will. Not
knowing that in spite of timely strict control some people are
more susceptible than others to develop diabetic complications, 
I felt guilty and ashamed, not comprehending how other
diabetics, who behave less carefully, walk through life
practically unscathed.



Then a transplant surgeon who had trained at the University
of Minnesota told me I should think about having a pancreas and 
kidney transplant. He gave me about 15 or 20 names of transplant
centers throughout the nation. I wrote to every one of them, read
all the information received and decided Minnesota was the best
option.



In May 1995, my parents and I came to the University of
Minnesota to see (at that time) Dr. David Sutherland (today I
lovingly call him Dave; he will not like it another way, but that
is now). On August first, the same year, my mother and I were in
the preparation room just about to have surgery. She, lovely and
beautiful as she is, offered to me not just one of her kidneys,
but also half a pancreas. In that moment I reiterate how much
she loves all of us, and that she has been my closest partner in
diabetes, and in all the complications I had. Today, she is in
perfect health, and strong and beautiful as ever.



All the organs worked right away, but I got a disease of the
kidney induced by one of the drugs, and my stay in the hospital
was protracted. I think Dr. Sutherland got tired of having the
same feature in the ward, and asked me to write a computer
program for internal organ allocation. After that, which I
finished out of the hospital, several other projects followed,
for the Diabetes Institute for Immunology and Transplantation,
which he directs at the University of Minnesota. Among those
projects, and many other ones we have today, we got married (to
each other).



Finally that kidney failed, due to the harshness of the
drug-induced disease and other factors. I spent some time on
dialysis, as because of my high percentage of antibodies (due to
a failed transplant and transfusions) I could not get a kidney
from the National Waiting List.



Then my aunt (my mother&apos;s sister), with her endless
generosity and care for her family, gave me one of her kidneys.
During the ordeal the half-pancreas my mother donated to me has
survived and kept me off insulin.



As you can see by now, I have a lot of people to thank; some
I have mentioned, others still remain in my pen (read keyboard)
and heart, nevertheless, the idea that we people need to support
and get support from each other has been a determinant one in my
life. Things have changed in the Fairview-University Transplant
Center; they are getting better, the people are very
knowledgeable but overall just good people.



Sometimes when peoples&apos; health has deteriorated, for
whatever reason, they get sad and depressed, because they feel
they cannot get out of the quagmire. They feel like they&apos;re in a
labyrinth. I have learned there is always a way to get out of
that feeling. The participatory part, by the patient, is really
important, to look for other options and ask yourself if a
particular step is for you.



There is a lot of information available, to help you. We,
who suffer such a complex condition, should try to obtain it.
Just going to one doctor, or one center, is not enough. Get
second opinions. Use the Internet. We need to educate ourselves.
By the way, our transplant center has a website for those
interested in pancreas or islet transplantation:
(www.diabetesinstitute.org). It is an extremely good website,
very valuable.



I have a pancreas transplant, actually half a pancreas, from
a living donor. Not many people have half. The pancreas actually
has two functions. One is to help the intestine with digestion;
the other function is insulin production. The beta cells, in the
islets of Langerhans scattered throughout the pancreas, are the
ones responsible for insulin production. The islets, interspersed
in the pancreas, accounts for 2% of its total weight.



In the 1960s and &apos;70s, surgeons worked on transplanting just
the islets, but also realized, at the time, that a complete
pancreas transplant presented less obstacles, and they focused on
making it work. Islet transplantation was a less invasive
procedure for the patient; but a lot of problems in separating
the islets from the rest of the pancreas needed to be solved. In
addition, the immunosuppression regime, the series of drugs
available to keep the body from rejecting the transplant, were
too harsh for the survival of the new islets by themselves; in
fact, they were, and some (still used today), are diabetogenic.



Nevertheless people kept working with the islets. A few,
like Dr. David Sutherland, worked on both pancreas and islet
transplantation. In the early &apos;90s, the islet transplant outcomes
at Minnesota were quite successful in some cases, but some of
the promising immunosuppressive drugs used were later withdrawn
from the market or, like dioxyspergualin, licensed by the FDA.



From the mid-90s to now, Dr. David Sutherland and Dr.
Bernard Hering, at the University of Minnesota, worked on the
clinical side of islet transplantation. Which drugs should be
used? In what amounts? Is it possible to attain tolerance, so
drugs are not needed? They studied ways to inject islets into the
portal vein or other sites. They have tried to use pork islets
(xenotransplantation) to make up for the shortage of human islet
cells. Successful use of animal islet cells could open
transplantation as an option to almost every individual afflicted
who wants to trade in diabetes for immunosuppression.



As of right now, there are de facto restrictions on islet
cell transplantation. One is insurance coverage; another is that
the FDA is very cautious, especially with biological products.
However, for diabetics whose kidneys have failed, Medicare is
preparing to pay for an islet as it now does for a pancreas
transplant. Some insurances cover pancreas transplant alone in
diabetics whose kidneys are functioning. I have no doubt that
very soon after clinical trials show islet transplants to be
efficacious and safe, the insurance situation will change. We
have a present. We really do have a future.

SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?

by Jean King



I recently called the talking book library and requested an
inspirational book that would help me with the task of being
legally blind. I received a book the next day. The writer, an
elderly, retired columnist of some sort, recounted for me the
problems he faced, and documented all the things his wife did FOR
him.



At first, I had wished for such complete custodial care.



I had already known those things this man spoke of, but I
dutifully finished the book, boxed it up, and promptly sent it
back. Then I wheeled myself out onto our beautiful deck and had
a good cry.



I could have generated these emotions on my own. I had not
needed the book I had spent my day reading. Then, I felt anger at
the time and energy wasted in this effort to be &quot;fixed.&quot; While I
was atoning for my anger, it occurred to me: Since I hadn&apos;t found
inspiration, I wondered if, perhaps, I might have it to GIVE.



Up to now, I have not shared my experience. I have guarded
my feelings just in case they might not be &quot;legitimate.&quot; But now
I will share them.



Twenty-some years ago, when I was in my forties, my feet
began to give me trouble. I did not have diabetes, but I had all 
the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. My first task, it soon
was apparent, was to convince the medical establishment, and
their psychological cohorts, that my pain was not &quot;all in my
head.&quot;



That done, I traipsed to the major medical clinics,
confirmed my own diagnosis, and discovered there was little else
to do. I finally accepted reality and went about experiencing
the painful loss of real sensation in my feet and legs. (It has
since moved on to my hands, face, and gut, but is, somehow, not
very relevant to the real living of my life anymore.) It just is
part of my reality.



The nerve loss in my feet was taking away the long hikes in
the Colorado mountain foothills and impeding my ability to drive,
even with the hand controls I used at that time.



Reading was becoming increasingly difficult. I had read
constantly since before I started school, so I thought perhaps I
should cut back on what could be &quot;over-use of my eyes.&quot; It did
not help.



My ophthalmologist recognized the problem. Over the years,
we had not much discussed my macular degeneration, but in 1992,
she sent me off to another specialist, her friend, who
specialized in low-vision problems, and she broke the news that I
was now &quot;legally blind.&quot;



There were not many choices left to make. I had already
given up my driver&apos;s license. I was NOT ready to give up being a
public school teacher.



Registration with the state department of vocational
rehabilitation was a given. The staff valiantly attempted to
find a means for me to continue teaching. My husband cooperated
in every way. Nothing worked. I said goodbye to my last

student. I went home to accept my new situation and to mourn.



My husband returned to work. At home, I huddled under an
afghan that my mother had crocheted for me long ago. I could not
cry. I huddled. My dog, Daisy,a Cairn terrier, cocked her head
and watched my behavior in dismay. She chased her tail in a
futile attempt to get me to go for a walk. Then,when I laid down
completely, she leaped up and settled herself ON TOP OF ME to
wait. She sighed ... and waited. She waited for months. I dwelt
on all the things that I could NOT do. Still, she waited.



Finally, my sluggish mind wandered. It wondered: what CAN I
do?



If I could find my shoes, I COULD venture outside for Daisy.
She was at the door, watching, waiting for me.



While I waited for her, I could see a tall weed in my
Columbine garden. I COULD sit on the ground and pull it. I
COULD.



I COULD scoot over a bit and reach another. I COULD. They
needed water. I COULD.



That night, I met my husband at the door with a grin that he
had almost forgotten. I COULD. Daisy smiled with my husband.



Each day, Daisy helped me find things that I COULD do. She
smiled again as she got her first good hair brushing in a year. I
could smile, too. I COULD.



My emotional and physical pain is not what I need to share
with you. We are the experts of what is our own. What I want to
give you are the things I learned while dwelling on the things I
had lost. You will not have time to do that job yourself once
you realize that you, too, CAN do.



In your own life, as you know, you will suffer losses,
through aging, perhaps diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, macular
degeneration, or some of the other ills of mankind. Whatever
those losses are, I ask you to face them. Look at whatever it is
in the light of reality. Look it over good. Get to know exactly
what you have lost. ACCEPT IT. Mourn it thoroughly, but don&apos;t
take too long. Life is short.



Then, ask yourself a question: What CAN I do about this
condition, now that I have just accepted it? The keyword here is
CAN. Don&apos;t waste your time on the reverse. Find one thing that
you CAN do -- and act on it. Another &quot;I can&quot; WILL follow. If it
is slow to appear, do the first &quot;can&quot; again while you wait. 
Celebrate it.



There might be something else you can do. Think about it;
be creative. Hand controls on my car allowed me to keep driving,
for a time, in spite of neuropathy and numbness in my feet. 
Another example: I now read books on tape. I didn&apos;t quit
reading -- I switched. And, I recorded my own favorite recipes
on tapes, while I still could read print. Then we found new
measuring cups made for folks with limited vision, at a discount
store. We marked the temperature settings better on my oven
control -- and I was a cook again!



DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF TO HELP YOURSELF. THEN, DROP
IT. If there becomes more you can do, you will think of it. DO
IT and move on.



Mantra for dealing with loss: FACE THE LOSS. MOURN THE
LOSS. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO TO MITIGATE THAT LOSS. LOCATE
THE HELP YOU NEED AND ASK FOR IT. ACCEPT THE HELP, GRACIOUSLY. 
MOVE ON.

NEW DIABETIC NEUROPATHY MEDICATION



One of the most common complications of diabetes is diabetic
neuropathy, diabetes-induced damage to the nerves that run
throughout the body, connecting the spinal cord to muscles, skin,
blood vessels, and other organs. Diabetic neuropathy can be
painful and disabling. Fortunately, the severest forms of 
neuropathy do not occur often.



Some symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (so named because it
occurs outside the brain and spinal cord) occur when the nerve
conduction is lost, such as muscular weakness, loss of feeling,
even loss of functions not normally under conscious control,
like digestion. These neuropathy symptoms include prickling,
tingling, burning, aching, or sharp jabs of needle-like pain. 
This pain can be severe and incapacitating. Or, there can be
complete numbness. Different types of neuropathy symptoms can
occur together. It is common to have pain even though many fibers
have been lost.



What Causes Neuropathy?



Researchers do not yet know what specifically causes
diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control seems to play a prominent
role -- as neuropathy is more likely to affect people who have
had diabetes for a long time or whose glucose control is poor.



Neuropathy can be prevented, slowed, or diminished, in some
cases. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial studied
complications in people on tight glucose control and those using
regular diabetes treatment. Only one-third as many people in the
tight-control group got neuropathy as in the standard-treatment
group. In addition, avoiding alcohol and cigarettes will
probably help protect your nerves from damage and prevent against
neuropathy.



Treatment for Neuropathy



Researchers are still looking for a way to heal nerves
damaged by neuropathy (see Anodyne Therapy article in this
issue). Right now, most treatment aims to relieve the painful
symptoms of neuropathy.



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently
approved the first treatment specifically for pain associated
with diabetic neuropathy. This chemical, Eli Lilly&apos;s Cymbalta
(duloxetine hydrochloride) is already in world-wide use as a
treatment for depression. It targets two chemical messengers in
the body, serotonin and norepinephrine, believed to play a role
in pain perception. Other antidepressants, not approved by the
FDA for this use, are also employed, &quot;off label,&quot; to relieve
nerve pain -- but Cymbalta is the first to be fully tested by the
FDA for this use and found effective. For more information about
Cymbalta (which is available now) talk to your doctor, telephone
the Lilly Answers Center: 1-800-545-5979, or visit
(www.lilly.com), or (www.cymbaltanews.com)

READ THE LABEL CAREFULLY



From the Editor: The following medication errors took place
in a professional setting. Doctors, pharmacists, and medical
staff made them. But, just as when we make errors ourselves, it
is the patient who winds up with the wrong medication. This
time, no one got hurt, but we can&apos;t depend on luck. You need to
know what you&apos;re taking, how much you&apos;re taking, and what each
pill is supposed to do. And, you have both the right and the
obligation to question your doctor, nurse, and pharmacist when
something you take gets changed. Ask! You&apos;ll be safer.



The following is reprinted from ISMP MEDICATION SAFETY
ALERT!, Vol. 9, Number 20, October 7, 2004, published by the
Institute for Safe Medication Practices. Used with permission.



A family practice physician in a community health center
prescribed metformin 500 mg bid to a newly diagnosed diabetic man
from India, who did not speak English. When the patient returned
to his office a few months later, he brought his medications with
him, as requested. His physician quickly noticed that metformin
was missing. Instead, the patient had a prescription bottle
labeled as metronidazole with directions to take 500 mg twice a
day. The prescription had been refilled several times. Luckily,
the patient&apos;s diabetes remained stable, and he seemed to suffer
no adverse effects from two months of unnecessary antimicrobial
therapy.



The physician notified the pharmacy of the error and asked
the pharmacist to check the original prescription, which had
been written clearly and correctly for metformin. Upon further
investigation, the pharmacist found the computer entry screen for
selecting these medications included METF (for metformin) and
METR (for metronidazole).



Apparently, one of the pharmacy staff members had entered
MET and selected the wrong medication that appeared on the
screen.



In another community pharmacy, the same mix-up happened
twice, one day apart. In one case, metformin was initially
dispensed correctly, even though the prescription had been
entered incorrectly as metronidazole again, when the wrong
mnemonic was chosen. The pharmacist who filled the prescription
clearly understood that the physician had prescribed metformin,
so he filled the prescription accordingly. However, he failed to
notice the order entry error, as he did not compare the 
prescription vial label to the drug container label.



Unfortunately, the initial order entry error led to
subsequent erroneous refills of metronidazole, as stated on the
label. In the other case, bulk containers of the medication were
available from the same manufacturer, both with similar highly
stylized labels. Thus, confirmation bias contributed to staff&apos;s
selection of the wrong drug. After reading, the staff member
believed he had the correct drug.



In a hospital pharmacy, metronidazole 500 mg and metformin
500 mg were accidentally mixed together in the metronidazole
storage bin. This resulted in dispensing metformin instead of
metronidazole. Fortunately, a nurse recognized the error before
giving the patient the wrong medication. Both were generic
products, although the brands FLAGYL (metronidazole) and
GLUCOPHAGE (metformin) are also available. Unit-dose packages of
these drugs contain bar codes, and the printed information is
very small, which adds to their similar appearance.



Safe Practice Recommendation:



Metronidazole-metformin mix-ups could be serious,
considering the different indications and the potential for drug
interactions. To avoid selecting the wrong drug from the screen,
consider programming the computer to display the specific brand
names along with the generic names whenever the MET stem is used
as a mnemonic. To reduce similarity of the containers, purchase
these medications from different manufacturers. Another option in
hospital settings is to stock only the 250 mg tablets of
metronidazole, since metformin is not available in that strength.
This option allows a small risk for nurses who may administer
just 250 mg when 500 mg is prescribed, but the potential for harm
from giving the wrong drug is greater. It&apos;s also a good idea to
separate the storage of these products.



During the dispensing process, drug names listed on written
prescriptions and hospital orders should be matched to computer
labels and manufacturers&apos; products. Since metformin is used to
treat a chronic condition, and metronidazole is more likely to be
used for an acute condition, outpatient refills for metronidazole
are less common and, therefore, bear a second look.



Asking physicians to include the drug&apos;s indication on the
prescription can also help prevent errors. We&apos;ll ask FDA to add
these drugs to the list of non-proprietary names that would
benefit from using tall man letters. Meanwhile, underline or
highlight the unique letter characters in these drug names to
make their differences stand out.

INSULIN-FREE: PANCREAS AND ISLET TRANSPLANTATION TO TREAT TYPE 1
DIABETES

by David Sutherland, MD, PhD



An estimated 1 million people in the United States have been
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Approximately 30 percent to 50
percent of them will experience secondary complications of the
disease, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke,
diabetic retinopathy, blindness, kidney disease, nervous system
disease, and amputation. A patient&apos;s risk of experiencing these
complications increases as his or her total lifetime exposure to
elevated blood glucose levels increases.



The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a clinical
study conducted from 1983 to 1993 by the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), illustrated
that if a patient has a qualified diabetes care team and
intensive insulin treatment, the patient&apos;s blood glucose levels
could be normalized for several years. However, this intensive
treatment may be difficult to achieve and sustain because it
would increase the patient&apos;s burden of diabetes management,
require increased medical services and patient monitoring, and be
accompanied by more frequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia.



Currently, the only way to restore normal blood glucose
levels without the risk of hypoglycemia is to replace the
patient&apos;s islets, either by transplantation of a whole pancreas
or by infusion of isolated pancreatic islets. Beta-cell
replacement therapy (pancreas and islet transplantation) should
be considered as an option for patients with type 1 diabetes and
renal insufficiency who are or will be obligated to
immunosuppression for a kidney transplant, or for non-uremic
patients who experience hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure
or progressive microvascular complications.



Pancreas transplantation



The first pancreas transplant was performed in 1966,
simultaneous with kidney transplant, at the University of
Minnesota. To date, more than 20,000 patients worldwide have
received pancreas transplants. Nearly 2,000 of these have been
performed at the University of Minnesota.



Three types of patients that are candidates for a pancreas
transplant:



* Diabetic patients with uremia: they would receive a
simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplant;



* Nephropathic patients who have already had renal insufficiency
corrected, usually by a living donor kidney transplant: they
would receive a pancreas transplant after they have had their
kidney transplant (PAK); and



* Diabetic patients who are nonuremic: they would receive a
pancreas transplant alone (PTA).



SPK transplants represent the majority of pancreas
transplants, but there is a trend toward performing more PAK
transplants as more living-donor kidney transplants are performed
to preempt the need for dialysis in diabetics with nephropathy.
In addition, more PTA transplants are being performed for
patients with diabetes who do not have advanced nephropathy but
who have such difficulty managing their diabetes that
immunosuppression is justified.



In addition to insulin independence, pancreas transplant
patients have experienced prevention and reversal of secondary
complications, improved quality of life, lengthened life span,
and reduction of health care costs per quality-adjusted life
year. A pancreas transplant can save the life of patients with
labile diabetes or hypoglycemia unawareness.



The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) captures data on
transplants performed throughout the U.S. From January 1999 to
May 2003, more than 5,700 patients received cadaver-donor
pancreas transplants for the first time. Outcomes measures
reported during this period are shown in Table 1.



Islet transplantation



The first islet transplant was performed in 1974, when the
islets from a cadaver-donor pancreas were infused into a diabetic
patient who had previously had a kidney transplant. Since then,
more than 700 islet allotransplants have been performed. Islet
transplant is far less invasive than a pancreas transplant; it
requires only a local anesthetic and takes about 60 minutes. The
islets are injected into the liver, where they secrete insulin
directly into the circulatory system to control blood sugars.



Between 1974 and the early 1990s, insulin-independence was
difficult to achieve in patients who had type 1 diabetes. Since
that time, islet transplants have become markedly more successful
by increasing the number of islets transplanted into the patient
and by reducing the diabetogenic side effects of
immunosuppression. New generations of immunosuppressive
medications have eliminated the use of prednisone in most
recipients and have allowed calcineurin inhibitors to be used in
low, nondiabetogenic doses.



Recent islet transplant trials have achieved improved
results, including the Universities of Alberta, Miami and
Minnesota. Most patients at the first two centers required
islets isolated from two or more donor pancreases to achieve
insulin independence, but at the University of Minnesota we have
been able to do so with a single donor by careful selection of
large donors for low insulin-requiring recipients and by an
isolation process that preserves islet viability to the utmost.



Two islet transplant trials were recently performed at the
University of Minnesota, with patients who had type 1 diabetes
and who experienced hypoglycemia unawareness. Twelve of 14
patients achieved insulin independence after receiving islets
from one cadaver donor pancreas each. After transplant, patients
had excellent glycemia control, as shown by elimination of severe
hypoglycemia post transplant, normal HbA1c levels, and normal
oral glucose-tolerance test results.



The University of Minnesota&apos;s high success rate using a
single donor pancreas is due to a number of factors. First, by
using the two-layer pancreas preservation method, we were able to
increase the number of islets isolated from the pancreas and
preserve the ability of these islets to reverse diabetes. The
two-layer pancreas preservation method involves sandwiching the
pancreas between a top layer (which contains a cold preservation
solution) and a bottom layer (which contains fluorocarbons that
have been saturated with oxygen). This method delivers more
nourishing oxygen to the pancreas than the cold preservation
layer alone can. Second, during the peritransplant period, we
targeted autoreactive T cells with anti-CD3 antibodies or
polyclonal T-cell antibodies, which inhibit activated
autoreactive T cells. Last, we cultured the islets pretransplant
so that T-cell-directed immunosuppression was achieved in the
patient well before islet infusion. This step is critical because
it likely reduces islet-directed immune responses mediated by
autoreactive, primed T cells to which the intravascularly
transplanted islets are immediately exposed. Pretransplant
culture allows for quality control studies to be performed before
infusion and improves the metabolic efficacy of cultured islets.
Delaying transplantation until two days after the patient starts
therapy with T-cell-depleting antibodies prevents the
transplanted islets from being exposed to the cytokine release
associated with the first two antibody infusions.



By revising islet transplant protocols to include these
advances, we have been able to achieve outcomes in islet
transplant patients that are consistent with the outcomes
experienced by pancreas transplant patients. Additional
improvements in islet transplant outcomes are expected, as unique
glucocorticoid- and calcineurin inhibitor-free, nondiabetogenic
immunosuppressive regimens have proved safe and effective in
relevant preclinical models.



We can expect to see licensure of isolated human islets as
biologic products in the foreseeable future as human islet
processing techniques are demonstrated to be controlled and
consistent, as islet product potency assays illustrate the
predictability of post-transplant islet function, and as
substantial evidence is provided of the clinical safety and
efficacy of islet transplantation. This licensure will help
secure third-party reimbursement, which will provide strong
incentive to maximize donor pancreas use. In addition, islet
transplants will become more available as pancreas preservation
techniques are further improved; as regional islet processing
centers are created; and as donor pancreas allocation methods,
logistics, and technical impediments are overcome.



Treatment considerations



Currently, patients who have either a pancreas transplant or
an islet transplant must take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent
rejection. Protocols designed to induce immunologic tolerance
specific to the donor are underway with islet transplant
patients. In the future, immunotherapy will be tailored to the
specific needs of the individual transplant patient.



Although a transition from pancreas to islet transplantation
may occur over the next few years, pancreas transplantation will
always be the better option for certain types of patients. For
example, patients with high insulin requirements before
transplant would be best served by a pancreas transplant.
Diabetic patients with exocrine deficiency would continue to
benefit most from an enteric drainage pancreas transplant. And
patients who are insulin resistant (type 2 diabetics) or who have
very high insulin requirements may need a pancreas transplant in
order to obtain enough islets to restore insulin independence
from a single donor.



Beta-cell replacement therapy will have a great impact on
tissue availability. Of the 6,000 cadaver donors available each
year, only half have pancreases suitable for transplantation.
Assuming each cadaver pancreas could be split for use in two
recipients and that living donors would be used for segmental
pancreas transplantation to the extent they have been used for
kidney transplants, up to 12,000 pancreas transplants could be
performed annually in the U.S. The potential exists to transplant
at a rate approaching half the annual incidence of new-onset
cases of Type 1 diabetes (30,000 a year) in the U.S.



Although the procedural and immunosuppressive risks now
associated with islet transplants will continue to diminish and
the efficacy of islet transplant protocols will continue to
improve, islet transplants will not be the ultimate approach to
diabetes care. However, islet transplants will create and build
momentum for the development of xenogeneic and stem/precursor
cell-derived islet Beta-cell therapy, which will make cell
replacement therapy routine in diabetes care.



Every transplant center should perform pancreas
transplantation, and eventually islet transplantation, for
treating patients who have diabetes. Every endocrinologist should
consider Beta-cell replacement in treating patients with type 1
diabetes who have hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure or
progressive microvascular complications.



Continued clinical research on pancreas and islet
transplants is needed to identify the most appropriate patients
for transplant, the best time to perform a transplant, and the
most suitable donor tissue and transplant protocol for a given
patient. Health care providers and third-party payers will
support Beta-cell replacement therapy more enthusiastically as
prospective, adequately powered clinical trials comparing
intensive insulin therapy and Beta-cell transplants earlier in
the course of diabetes document superior outcomes in
cost-adjusted quality of life. The results of these clinical
trials could provide a strong rationale for evidence-based
stratification to islet-cell replacement in at-risk patients with
incapacitating hypoglycemia or incipient secondary complications.

Division, director of the Diabetes Institute for Immunology and

 AN ASPIRIN A DAY ... 



 This article originally appeared in the &quot;News You Can Use&quot;
section of CONTROL SOLUTIONS, Summer 2004 edition, published by
Integrated Diabetes Services 



 Men and women with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) are at
greatly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. One
of the primary reasons is increased production of thromboxane,
which causes blood vessels to constrict and platelets within the
bloodstream to become extra &quot;sticky.&quot; Because it blocks the
production of thromboxane, low-dose aspirin therapy has been
shown to be an effective method for preventing heart disease and
stroke. The American Diabetes Association recommends daily low-dose aspirin (75-162mg) for the following people: 



 Those with a personal history of circulatory disease (heart
attack, stroke, t.i.a. (transient ischemic attack), impaired
circulation in the hands or feet) 

 Those with type 2 diabetes who are over age 40, or who have
other factors for cardiovascular disease (positive family
history, high blood pressure, smoking, elevated cholesterol,
protein in urine) 

 Those with type 1 diabetes who are over age 40, or with
other risk factors for cardiovascular disease 



 Aspirin therapy is not recommended for those under age 21, 

 or anyone who suffers from bleeding problems. For more
information, consult your physician.

 BEGINNING CARB COUNTING: TEN COST-CUTTING TIPS 

 by Linda Ruholl, RN, PhD 

 (Includes photo of Linda Ruholl) 



 The newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic must make many life
changes in a short period of time. According to the American
Diabetes Association, dietary control is essential to all
diabetics. It can put off the advent of insulin therapy for
years, or perhaps indefinitely. Patients who take no oral
medications need to tightly control carbohydrate intake, but carb
counting can be confusing and expensive. Basic education from a
dietitian or certified diabetic educator (CDE) is essential. 
These ten simple strategies help cut expenses. 



 1. Be cautious about purchasing special &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;low carb&quot;
foods. 



 Many &quot;diet&quot; items are quite expensive when you take into
consideration other alternatives. Try the smallest size first.
Look for coupons and use them at a market that doubles the face
value of the coupon. Read the label to find out the
manufacturer&apos;s definition of a &quot;serving.&quot; It probably won&apos;t be a
&quot;bowlful.&quot; Some manufacturers of so-called &quot;low carb&quot; foods keep
the carb numbers down by shrinking the serving size. 



 2. Be equally careful about buying special cookbooks. 



 It&apos;s all too easy to spend $15 or $20 for a cookbook, only
to discover the 250-page book has exactly three recipes you and
your family would even consider eating. Go the library instead. 
If you have a card, you can take a cookbook home to spend more
time examining it. If you are not a regular patron, study the
cookbooks at the library and copy likely recipes onto 3x5 inch
index cards. Your local library may also have back issues of
DIABETES FORECAST or similar diabetic-focused magazines you can
examine or check out. 



 3. Make your own &quot;healthy&quot; sweets. 



 Fresh fruits have natural sugars, and you can easily enhance
these flavors. Thicken water with a little cornstarch, pour it
over the fruit and cook gently until the fruit is soft, but not
mushy. Add Equal or Splenda to taste. After one or two tries,
you will know how much is enough. Sample the generic sweeteners; 
they are considerably less expensive than the brand name stuff,
and many people can&apos;t tell the difference in a blind taste test. 



 4. Overhaul your favorite recipes. 



 Many recipes in traditional cookbooks are high in sugar,
especially white sugar. Convert them to a lower carb version by
substituting an artificial sweetener. Our family&apos;s experience is
that aspartame and sucralose taste satisfyingly sweet, but other
sweeteners leave a bitter aftertaste. Bulk packages of these
products include conversion charts that list exactly how much to
substitute for a given amount of sugar. 

 

 5. Invest in a couple of compact and inexpensive reference
books. 



 Total calorie intake and carbohydrate counts are both
important. The Doctor&apos;s Pocket Calorie, Fat and Carbohydrate
Counter, by Allan Borushek, will give you plenty of information
about foods you prepare yourself. Other sections give data about
restaurant and international foods, as well as counts for many US
fast-food chains. Borushek&apos;s book measures only 4.5 by 6 inches,
and is about a half-inch thick, making it small enough to fit
into a coat pocket, purse or glove compartment. At $6.99, it is
a good buy. 



 A second inexpensive guidebook is The New Glucose Revolution
Complete Guide to Glycemic Index Values. The book has two sets of
tables: an A to Z listing of foods with their respective GI and
carb count, and a listing of foods ranked from low to high GI.
This lets you compare foods within a category and make some
predictions about how quickly a given food will raise your blood
sugar. For example, a quick check of the dry ready-to-eat cereal
section shows you that All-Bran has a GI of 38, but Kellogg Corn
Flakes rates a 92. This guide is also a bargain at $6.95. 

 

 6. Look at directions for food preparation with an open mind. 



 Packaged foods will often stretch to make more servings. 
For example, our favorite vanilla diet pudding mix calls for two
cups of skim milk and makes four servings. Try adding three cups
of milk next time. The mixture sets up just the same, and you
get six cups of pudding instead of four. I add a half-teaspoon
of vanilla and a little extra sweetener before mixing. 



 7. Plan fast food and family restaurant trips carefully. 



 If you are planning to take the kids or grandkids to
McDonald&apos;s, don&apos;t despair. You can eat there, too. McDonald&apos;s
publishes A Full Serving of Nutrition Facts, which gives the full
gamut of nutritional information about all their menu choices.
Many of the sandwiches are very high in carbs, but there are a
number of options that contain less than 30 grams of
carbohydrates, such as Chicken McNuggets and the salads with
grilled chicken. 



 Tuck some of the nutrition sheets from other restaurants
into a folder and slip them under your passenger seat. When you
travel, you will be able to find something suitable. One useful
website contains information about ten different fast food
restaurants, including Arby&apos;s, Burger King, Hardee&apos;s, Taco Bell,
Subway, and Wendy&apos;s. Go to www.fatcalories.com, and you can
search each restaurant&apos;s offerings by carb count or by total
calorie count. The data base ranks the choices from highest to
lowest number of carbs. 



 8. Pay for food and not for packaging. 



 Many nutritious foods are inexpensive. A good example is
cereal. You can eat it for breakfast, a quick lunch or for a
snack. Cereal by the bag is cheaper than boxed cereal. A
generic plastic bag of raisin bran cereal sells for 10.8 cents
per ounce in the Midwest, while boxed raisin bran cereal costs
16.6 cents per ounce. You would pay 10.5 cents per ounce for
toasted oats in the bag, but 16.9 cents per ounce in the box. 
Over a year&apos;s time, the difference adds up. 



 9. Use the internet to learn about your condition. 



 Both commercial and public service sites have good
information The American Diabetes Association (ADA) site is the
mother lode of current and accurate information. There is a
special section of this site for the newly diagnosed diabetic. 
It will help clear up confusion about carbohydrate counting and
other issues. Check out the ADA at (www.diabetes.org). 

 

 DIABETES DIGEST offers a one-page glycemic index list of the
300 most common foods. You can access it at
(www.diabetesdigest.com). This same site has a useful one-page 
sheet of hints, Ten Tips for Taming Your Cravings. 

 

 10. Keep track of your daily blood sugars, and glycosated
hemoglobin levels, as well as your blood lipid levels. 



 Health providers find it easier to interact with an informed
and motivated patient. Your doctor or nurse practitioner will be
impressed with your organizational skills, and will work harder
with you to manage your diabetes cost-effectively. The newer
oral medications for diabetes are quite expensive. Why enrich
the pharmaceutical industry if you can avoid it? 



 Go to (www.equal.com) to download your own copy of EASY
EVERYDAY LOGBOOK. This booklet has a section where you can track
your lipid and HbA1c levels, as well as day-by-day sheets for
carbohydrate counting and blood glucose tracking. This same site
offers a two-page educational offering titled: Ready, Set and
Start Counting: How to Use Carbohydrate Counting to Keep Your
Blood Glucose Healthy. Use this information to supplement and
review the information you received from your dietitian or
certified diabetic educator.

 REFLECTING ON OBESITY 

 by Peter J. Nebergall, PhD 



 (includes photo of Peter J. Nebergall, with cat) 



 I&apos;ve been reading a lot of different articles about
childhood obesity and its impact on long term health. The
phrase: &quot;experts say...&quot; must surely be the most abused in the
language. What experts? And where are they looking? 



 I&apos;ve heard &quot;suburban sprawl&quot; blamed for overweight kids. 
That&apos;s silly. Go to the inner cities, and look at the children. 
If increasing &quot;suburban sprawl&quot; was the significant agent of
obesity, these ghetto kids (whose environment is just as it was
for their parents and grandparents) wouldn&apos;t be so quickly
getting heavier, faster than the suburbanites. Hypothesis
disproved. 



 Moviemaker/prankster Morgan Spurlock recently produced a
shockumentary film called &quot;Supersize Me,&quot; in which he ate only
fast food for a month, a LOT of fast food, and did not exercise. 
He gained a lot of weight, and his cholesterol shot up. Spurlock
would have us blame the fast food industry (and it is easy to eat
a lot of calories at a fast food restaurant) but he knowingly set
out to consume three times the &quot;maintenance amount&quot; (1800
calories) a sedentary adult needs to maintain weight -- and one
could just as easily do this at the local barbecue, all-you-can-eat catfish restaurant, or kitchen table, with biscuits and gravy
for breakfast. Bad food choices. 



 Spurlock has a point, however. Fast food is so easy to
overeat. Ralph Nader called the double cheeseburger &quot;a weapon of
mass destruction.&quot; We are subjected to an incredible cacophony of
adverts urging us to have more, that &quot;bigger is better,&quot; whether
it be soap powders, washing machines, SUVs, or &quot;$6 burgers for
3.95.&quot; The fast food marketing industry is certainly part of
this problem -- but so are we, the consumers -- and all this
&quot;Madison Avenue&quot; only works if WE fall for it. We don&apos;t have to. 



 Another study found that, if offered more food, at the same
price, people take it. &quot;We&apos;re getting something free! Yippie!&quot; 



 Right. Isn&apos;t that why &quot;all you can eat&quot; buffets are so
popular? Go watch, and, if you can, take a foreigner with you,
someone from a country that doesn&apos;t have such places (most
don&apos;t.) They&apos;ll be shocked at the overeating -- and you should
be too. 



 We, and our children, ARE gaining weight. There are several
causes, and overuse of &quot;junk food&quot; outlets is one of them. But,
if we don&apos;t cook healthy food, and don&apos;t provide our children an
alternative, what else can we expect? 



 Lack of exercise is an issue. A BIG issue. Our explosive
expansion in waist sizes perfectly maps on the cutback or
cancellation of serious school physical education classes (&quot;for
budgetary reasons&quot;) and on the arrival of &quot;virtual reality&quot;
computer games. When you want an adventure, do you rent one, or
do you go have one? If you move less, its just the same as if
you eat more. You gain. What else can we expect? 



 I&apos;ve written about the &quot;trick food&quot; diets that would have us
&quot;eat all you want&quot; -- if you buy it from THEM.&quot; When they work,
is it not because their stuff is so expensive its high price
limits consumption? They are neither an economical nor a healthy
answer to obesity -- just another product to sell. 

 

 Obesity is a problem for all of us. If you have diabetes,
or if you have the genetic background for type 2, it can make it
worse. Excess weight can bring on the symptoms, and what was
once &quot;adult onset&quot; diabetes is now arriving in pre-teen years. 
More years with diabetes means more time for serious
complications -- so we need to act, now, before more damage is
done. 

 

 What can WE do? A bunch. We can stop &quot;supersizing it,&quot; and
remember Gluttony was one of the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; -- for good
reason. We can count our calories, and stop when we&apos;ve had
enough. We can commence an exercise program. We can stop
pretending it isn&apos;t better to be fit. It is. 



 Obesity is a solvable problem. We can all help; by action,
and by good example. Let&apos;s roll.

 OPENING BLIND EYES TO SCIENCE 

 (the following article is courtesy NASA and the National
Federation of the Blind) 



 A 14-year-old blind boy named Steven is digging in a
container of soil at the Maryland Science Center. Steven and
Amelia are blind, yet both were able to read the temperature with
a thermometer and measure precipitation with a rain gauge at a
science camp this past summer. 



 Their secret? 



 Steven and Amelia, along with 10 other blind students ages
11-14, were using a talking thermometer, a Braille-marked rain
gauge and other tools identified by NASA for use by the visually
impaired. 



 The tools got their first major test in July at the end of
the week-long &quot;Circle of Life&quot; camp put on by the National
Federation of the Blind and sponsored by NASA. On the camp&apos;s
final day, students visited the pond and forest area of NASA&apos;s
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., where they made
observations of the soil, vegetation, weather and birds. 



 For many of the kids it was the first time they had used
observation instruments specifically geared toward the senses of
sound and touch, rather than sight. 



 &quot;I didn&apos;t know they existed,&quot; said Steven, now a
ninth-grader at a science-oriented high school in New York. &quot;It
was amazing to see the technology.&quot; 



 Goddard soil scientist Elissa Levine has been leading NASA&apos;s
effort to introduce various blind-friendly gadgets to the
visually impaired community. Her work is aimed at making
activities such as GLOBE -- a NASA-sponsored science education
program in which K-12 students around the world take measurements
of soil, land cover, air, water and living things -- more
accessible to the blind. 



 &quot;I have been working with the GLOBE program for many years
and am aware of how effective it is as a learning experience,
which made me interested in seeing if it would be as effective
for blind students as well,&quot; Levine said. 



 The new instruments include two kinds of talking
thermometers -- one for the air and a &quot;meat thermometer&quot; that can
be inserted into the soil. There&apos;s also a talking compass, and a
talking sensor that analyzes soil color. A graduated cylinder
with a floating Styrofoam plug serves as a rain gauge. The plug
moves up or down depending on the volume of water and is attached
to a plastic measuring scale marked with Braille. 



 Unlike other sciences that are sometimes more abstract,
Earth science provides plenty of convenient opportunities for
interactive, nonvisual activities, such as listening to birds or
rubbing soil between one&apos;s fingers. 



 &quot;The best thing about Earth science is that there is a
natural laboratory right outside the classroom door,&quot; Levine
said. 



 Promoting interest in science -- Earth or otherwise -- among
the more than 93,000 estimated blind school-age children in the
United States is as much about educating teachers as it is kids,
according to the camp&apos;s lead instructor, Robin House, who says
teachers often underestimate the potential of blind students. 



 &quot;Many times blind students are left out of sciences and math
because some educators think, &apos;Oh, this is too difficult, they
couldn&apos;t possibly grasp these concepts,&apos;&quot; said House, who herself
is blind. &quot;The idea of this particular camp was a little bit of
exposure in all the areas of science to get kids going, &apos;I can do
science, I can do it. I can become a scientist if I want to.&apos;&quot; 



 In the days preceding their visit to Goddard, the campers
dissected a dogfish shark and dug for dinosaur fossils at the
Maryland Science Center, explored seashells with blind shell
expert Geerat Vermeij, took a boat ride on the Chesapeake Bay,
and listened to sounds from space with blind physicist Kent
Cullers. 



 The camp was the first step in the National Federation of
the Blind&apos;s initiative to create a National Center for Blind
Youth in Science. A second camp held in August -- &quot;Rocket On!&quot; --
challenged blind high school students to develop, build and
launch a 12-foot rocket from NASA&apos;s Wallops Flight Facility on
Virginia&apos;s Eastern Shore. 



 For 12-year-old Amelia, the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; camp was a rare
chance to experience science up close and personal. &quot;We don&apos;t
usually get to have so much hands-on activities when we&apos;re with a
classroom. We have to touch stuff to be able to know what they
really are like,&quot; Amelia said. &quot;There are a lot of tools out
there that blind people can use to investigate science. Blind
people can pretty much do anything, but they just do it
differently.&quot; 



 In addition to having the right kinds of tools, House says
it is critical to the success of blind students that educators
help dispel misconceptions among sighted students as to what
blind people are capable of. 



 &quot;Sometimes it might take a little bit longer, maybe there&apos;s
a different way that the blind student has to go about doing
something,&quot; House said. &quot;But that&apos;s what science is really about
anyway -- trial and error, trying things, taking risks.&quot; 



 Steven has a simple, straightforward message for both
students and teachers: &quot;Blindness doesn&apos;t have to be a barrier.
Being blind doesn&apos;t stop you from having a brain and doing
science.&quot;

 KIDNEY DISEASE: WHAT CAN YOU DO? 

 by Ed Bryant 

 (includes photo of Ed Bryant) 



 I am a long-term diabetic who experienced renal failure. On
August 9, 1983, I had a kidney transplant. To date, 21 years
later, I feel great, and the new organ is functioning perfectly. 



 Knowing that nephropathy, kidney failure, is a frequent
complication of diabetes, what can YOU do to prevent, minimize,
or slow it? There is a tight statistical link between quality of
diabetes control - and ramifications such as heart and blood
vessel disease, diabetic eye disease, and diabetogenic kidney
failure. We know the tighter your control, the less chance you
will experience these complications. Good self-management is the
BEST way to cut the risk. 



 There are things you can do. First, don&apos;t smoke. Nicotine,
the narcotic active ingredient in tobacco, is a vasoconstrictor,
raising blood pressure, stiffening capillaries, and making it
harder for the kidneys to filter wastes. 



 Urinary tract infections need prompt treatment, to limit the
damage they can do to already strained kidneys. Tell your doctor
promptly if you think you have such an infection. 



 Excessive obesity raises blood pressure and increases
insulin resistance. Keeping your weight down helps in general,
and the resultant blood pressure drop is good for your kidneys. 



 You need to control your cholesterol, as too much of this
fatty substance in your blood overworks your kidneys. Proper
diet, exercise, and appropriate medications can lower your
cholesterol levels. Consult a Registered Dietitian (RD) for
advice; kidney failure imposes unique constraints. 



 High levels of stress can be damaging. It drives up blood
pressure, can harm the kidneys by raising fluid pressure, further
straining already weakened filter networks. Stress reduction is
part of a healthy lifestyle. Ask your health care team for
advice here. 



 Other than &quot;keep your diabetes under the best possible
control, and live a healthy lifestyle,&quot; I can offer little advice
about prevention. 

 

 Once kidney disease is diagnosed, however, a great deal can
be done to retard its progression. Current statistics suggest
perhaps four out of every ten diabetics may experience measurable
kidney disease, though many of these individuals should be able
to avoid progressing to outright kidney failure, End Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD). 



 Testing Your Kidney 



 How is the severity of kidney disease measured? Several
tests measure creatinine, a waste product from muscle mass. 
Although everyone&apos;s body produces creatinine, people whose
kidneys are failing cannot properly excrete it. One test
measures the amount of creatinine in the blood, and the other is
&quot;creatinine clearance,&quot; a 24-hour urine test. Normal &quot;blood
creatinine,&quot; for someone with healthy kidneys, is about 0.7 to
1.3. Government guidelines (April 1995) recommend dialysis when
the blood creatinine rises to 6 or above (the number rises as you
get worse). However, some diabetics will experience kidney
failure before that point. There is much variation between
individuals who have ESRD, and the actual range for &quot;kidney
failure&quot; runs from 3 through 8--but at or above 6, Medicare will
pay for dialysis. 



 &quot;Creatinine clearance&quot; is considered a more reliable test. 
In this 24-hour urine test, the numbers produced approximately
indicate the percent of normal kidney function remaining to the
individual (the number goes own as you get worse). The 1995
government guidelines (which relate to Medicare part B
eligibility) state they will fund dialysis when this test
produces a reading of 15 or less. 



 Two other tests measure protein spillage into the urine. 
These are the microalbumin test and the test for proteinurea. 
The protein albumin is not normally excreted into the urine, and
its presence in the urine, in small amounts (microalbuminuria) or
larger concentrations (proteinurea) can indicate kidney disease. 
While not considered absolute diagnostic evidence, a positive
finding in either should be immediately followed by further
testing, as these tests are very sensitive, and the microalbumin
test can detect kidney disease long before the other
tests--allowing earlier medical intervention. 



 Options 



 Individuals experiencing impaired kidney function, but whose
test results indicate they do not yet need dialysis or
transplantation, might benefit from regular use of ACE
(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) Inhibitors, commonly used to
control hypertension, high blood pressure. Now widely accepted,
these ACE Inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce
further kidney degeneration. Note: A diabetic experiencing
kidney failure, but whose blood pressure is not elevated, can
still use ACE Inhibitors for keeping fluid pressure down in the
kidneys. This therapy has been shown to significantly reduce
strain on eyes and cardiovascular system, as well. Talk to your
nephrologist (kidney specialist) about the ACE Inhibitors. 



 End Stage Renal Disease 



 The damaged kidney may worsen to the point where it can no
longer carry out its blood-purifying function. Then dialysis or
transplantation are necessary in order to preserve life. This is
ESRD, end stage renal disease. What are your options then? 



 There are three: In hemodialysis, the patient&apos;s circulatory
system is temporarily linked with a machine that performs the
blood-cleansing functions of the human kidney. In peritoneal
dialysis (CAPD or CCPD) a tube is inserted into the patient&apos;s
peritoneal cavity, allowing urine and unneeded fluids to
periodically drain from the body. The third option is kidney
transplantation, in which a donated kidney is surgically
implanted into the patient&apos;s body. 



 National Institutes of Health statistics show that 42.9
percent of all individuals facing dialysis are there because of
diabetes, and about 40 percent of those commencing dialysis or
seeking a transplant at this time are diabetic. Some remain on
dialysis long-term; others make use of the process while awaiting
a kidney transplant. 



 Dialysis 



 Dialysis is not an &quot;artificial kidney.&quot; A person undergoing
hemodialysis must be hooked up to a machine three times a week,
three to four hours per session. 



 Like the kidney, a hemodialysis machine is a filter. Where
it uses tubes and chemicals, the kidney uses millions of
microscopic blood vessels, fine enough to pass urine while
retaining suspended proteins. Long-term high blood glucose can
significantly damage the kidney&apos;s filters, leading to scarring,
blockage, and diminished renal function. Diabetes is the leading
cause of kidney disease (the second is hypertension). Long-term
diabetics often have cardiovascular and blood pressure problems
as well, and the added strain of hemodialysis, with its rise in
blood pressure straining eyes and heart function, can be too much
for some. The diabetic dialysis patient spends, on the average,
33 percent more time in the hospital than does the non-diabetic
dialysis patient, according to 1999 USRDS figures. 



 Some patients choose CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis) or its variant, CCPD (continuous cycling peritoneal
dialysis), both of which can be carried out at home, without an
assistant. Though the risk of infections is heightened (as it is
with any permanent catheterization), these two processes have
their advantages. 



 Transplantation 



 Kidney transplantation is a logical alternative for many. A
transplant frees the patient from the many hours spent on
hemodialysis procedures each week, or from the periodic
&quot;exchanges&quot; and open catheter of CAPD, allowing a nearly normal
lifestyle. It can bring real improvement in quality of life and
overall longevity. 



 An article, published November 1999 in the New England
Journal of Medicine, shows the longevity gains have been major. 
The average graft survival (how long the kidney remained
functional, not the patient) was, from a living donor, 17 years,
in 1988. Per 1996 statistics, it is now 36 years. The typical
cadaver kidney transplanted in 1988 lasted 11 years, but in 1996,
the life expectancy of the organ was nearly 19 years. The study,
led by Dr. Sundaram Hariharan, at the Medical College of
Wisconsin, funded by the National Institutes of Health, concludes
the improvement is largely due to the development of better anti-rejection medications. 



 &quot;Fifty percent of all kidney transplantations taking place
today are into diabetics,&quot; states Giacomo Basadonna, MD, PhD, a
transplant surgeon at Yale University School of Medicine, in New
Haven, Connecticut. He reports that success rates are identical
with kidney transplants performed on non-diabetic ESRD patients. 
&quot;Today,&quot; he advises, &quot;average kidney survival, from a living
donor, is greater than 15 years.&quot; 



 &quot;Will you survive longer once you get a transplant?&quot; asks
Marianna Markel, MD, Director of Transplant Nephrology at SUNY
Health Science Center, in Brooklyn, New York. &quot;If you&apos;re a
diabetic, it looks like the answer may be yes, perhaps because
certain substances which build up in the blood of diabetics
(advanced glycosylation end-products) are not removed well by
dialysis, and may contribute to a shortened lifespan for diabetic
patients on dialysis.&quot; 



 I and others knowledgeable in kidney transplantation advise
you to pick the best transplant center possible. Once you have
read their statistics, ask your prospective center plenty of
questions. If they don&apos;t answer to your satisfaction, you should
consider going to another center. 



 Facts and Statistics 



 What is the success rate for kidney-transplant surgery? 
According to the &quot;United States Renal Data System 1999 Annual
Data Report,&quot; published by the National Institutes of Health,
about 75 percent for a cadaver-donated kidney, better than 90
percent with a kidney donated by a living relative, with an
overall success rate of better than 85 percent, better than 90
percent in some centers. UNOS data indicate the averages (based
on graft survival, healthy kidney, five years after transplant)
are improving. The National Institutes of Health reports that
current &quot;graft survival&quot; (donated kidneys successfully
functioning in the transplant recipient) rates are approximately
the same now, whether the recipient has diabetes or not. 



 What percentage of type 1 diabetics will face ESRD? Current
statistics suggest between 20 and 25 percent, with many factors
(genetic, ethnic, lifestyle) taken into account. 



 Must the ESRD patient be on dialysis before being considered 
eligible for a transplant? NO! Although some behind-the-times
nephrologists still believe so, Fairview-University Medical
Center&apos;s Transplant Center, which pioneered diabetic kidney and
pancreas transplantation, recommends once your physician has
determined kidney failure is on the way, further delay could be
harmful. The more time spent subjecting your body to the toxic
excesses of kidney failure and the strains of dialysis, the
greater the risk of serious complications like retinopathy and
cardiovascular (heart) degeneration. 



 Your nephrologist should be able to tell you more about your
options. For information about kidney transplantation, contact a
reputable kidney transplant center (there are approximately 250
in the U.S. today), or the United Network for Organ Sharing, 1100
Boulders Park, Suite 500, Richmond, VA 23225; telephone: 
1-800-243-6667; website: (www.unos.org). All UNOS information is
available on the World Wide Web, but they will also send you
pertinent information, by mail, about transplant centers in your
area or nationwide. Contact them at the above address, and ask
them for the &quot;kidney transplant package.&quot; They also offer the
brochure &quot;What Every Patient Needs to Know,&quot; and an organ-donor
card for you to carry.

center data, contact: Health Resources and Services

(www.hrsa.gov/osp/dot). This agency also maintains the website:
www,organdonor.gov, which offers many useful links and much
pertinent information. 



 Renal failure is not a kiss of death. There are options,
and at least one of them will be right for you. Keep your
diabetes under good control, and your blood pressure down, to cut
the risks--but if it happens (like it did to me), remember that
with proper care you stand every chance of living just as long as
you would have with healthy kidneys.

 TRANSPLANT PATIENTS SPEAK: 



 The following individuals are the real experts. 
Collectively, they have more than 168 years experience living
with a transplant! All of them would choose transplantation
again. Although kidney and pancreas transplantation are not for
everyone, and sometimes they don&apos;t work, they should be given
strong consideration. 



 Karen Mayry, from South Dakota, received her kidney
transplant at Fairview-University Medical Center, in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, on January 12, 1977. She declares, &quot;I feel great!&quot; 



 Betty Walker, from Missouri, received her kidney on July 13,
1978, at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. In her words: 
&quot;I was just existing on dialysis; and my transplant gave life
back to me.&quot; 



 Lenny Ruygt, from California, received her kidney transplant
at Pacific Medical Center, in San Francisco, on St. Patrick&apos;s
Day, March 17, 1980. She says: &quot;On dialysis, I had no energy at
all--I would sleep all but two hours of a day. After my
transplant, I felt energized!&quot; 



 Linda Bingham, from Ohio, who received her kidney transplant
at University Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 10,
1981, says, &quot;I feel great. I have been given a whole new life.&quot; 



 Ed Bryant, from Missouri, received his kidney on August 9,
1983, at Fairview-University Medical Center, in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He says: &quot;There is no comparison between life on
dialysis, and how I&apos;ve felt since my transplant.&quot; 



 Faith Tootel, from California, received her new kidney on
September 24, 1984, and her new pancreas on September 29, 2000,
from Fairview-University Medical center, in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. She says: &quot;My quality if life is tremendously
improved now, since I received my transplants.&quot; 



 Tim Cox, from South Carolina, received his combined kidney-pancreas transplant, also from Fairview-University Medical
Center, in Minneapolis, on Christmas Eve, 1988. He says: &quot;I&apos;m
not handicapped; I&apos;m handicappable.&quot; 



 Lindy Guidry, From Louisiana, received her combined kidney
and pancreas transplant, on August 8, 1993, at the University
Hospital of New Orleans, and she says: &quot;I want to make the most
of my second opportunity.&quot;

 MEDICARE THERAPEUTIC SHOE PROGRAM 



 In an effort to prevent foot ulcers in people with diabetes
who are at risk, Medicare will help pay for therapeutic shoes.
For those who qualify, Medicare will pay 80 percent of the
allowed amount for one pair of shoes and up to three pairs of
molded innersoles per year. (The allowed amount varies, depending
on the kind of footwear you need.) Most secondary insurers will
help pay the other 20 percent. 



 Who Qualifies? 



 Not everyone with diabetes needs special shoes. To qualify,
you must be under a comprehensive diabetes treatment plan and
have one or more of the following: 



 Partial or complete amputation of the foot 

 Previous foot ulceration 

 History of preulcerative callus 

 Peripheral neuropathy with evidence of callus formation 

 Foot deformity 

 Poor circulation 



 Who Does NOT Qualify? 



 People with diabetes who do not have one of the above
conditions. It is not enough to just have diabetes. 



 What Paperwork is Required? 



 The physician treating you for your diabetes must certify
that you have diabetes, that you have one or more foot problems
just mentioned, that you are under a comprehensive diabetes
treatment plan, and that you need special shoes. Medicare has a
form for this certification. You will also need a prescription
for the shoes. 



 Who Prescribes the Shoes? 



 A prescription is required from a podiatrist or physician who
knows how to fit shoes and inserts for people with diabetes. The
prescription should indicate a particular type of footwear, such
as shoes, inserts, or modifications. 



 Who Supplies the Shoes? 



 The footwear must be fitted and furnished by a podiatrist or
other qualified individual, such as a pedorthist, orthotist, or
prosthetist. The certifying physician may not furnish the footwear
unless he or she practices in a defined rural area or area where
there is a shortage of heath professionals. The prescribing
podiatrist may be the supplier. 



 What Do You Get? 



 Coverage is limited to one of the following per calendar
year: 



 One pair of off-the-shelf extra-depth shoes and three
additional pairs of special inserts that your podiatrist will
select for you. Extra-depth shoes have room to accommodate
innersoles or orthotics. 

 One pair of off-the-shelf extra-depth shoes including a
modification, and two additional pairs of special inserts. 

 One pair of custom-molded shoes and two additional pairs of
special inserts. 



 I Have Diabetes and Need Special Shoes. Why Shouldn&apos;t I Get Them
Free From Medicare? 



 Remember, there is no such thing as a free lunch -- and there
is no such thing as a free pair of shoes. There are over 16
million people with diabetes in the United States. Many of them
are of Medicare age. If every Medicare beneficiary with diabetes
gets special shoes, there will be no money left for other
important aspects of the Medicare program. If we abuse the shoe
benefit, Medicare suffers -- and everyone who depends on Medicare
will suffer as well.

 ANODYNE THERAPY AND DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY 

 by Angie Bowman, PT; Kim Hamel, OT; and Linda Hicks, BSN, MS, CDE 

 

 &quot;When I met a patient who had stepped on a nail and didn&apos;t
even know it until he couldn&apos;t remove his shoe that night, I knew
how important our work is here at our Anodyne Neuropathy Care
Center at LifeCare Center of Charleston,&quot; said Angie Bowman, PT. 
&quot;We have treated over 400 patients with the Anodyne Therapy System
and all but a handful have shown improvement in their symptoms
including significantly reduced pain, improved sensation and
improved balance. We have also used it on chronic diabetic ulcers
with good success. It has been rewarding to see these patients
improve and get their lives back to normal.&quot; 



 If you have peripheral neuropathy, you are not alone. An
estimated more than 20 million people suffer from its
complications, which can include pain, numbness, balance problems
and slow-healing foot wounds and amputations. 



 What Causes Peripheral Neuropathy (PN)? 



 PN is one of the most common complications of diabetes, but
may also be caused by circulatory problems, certain drugs,
chemotherapy, alcohol abuse, anemia, AIDS, back problems, surgery,
and by unknown causes (referred to as idiopathic neuropathy). 



 Research now shows one cause of Diabetic Peripheral
Neuropathy (DPN) is poor microcirculation to the nerves in the
feet, legs and hands. In addition, recent studies have suggested
an important molecule called nitric oxide (NO) may be in short
supply in the blood vessels of people with diabetes. This
molecule is critical for opening the blood vessels with each beat
of your heart. Combine high blood pressure, high cholesterol or
plaque build-up in your blood vessels with low amounts of NO (all
common in diabetes), and the result is significantly reduced blood
flow to the areas furthest from your heart. The nerves and tissues
in those areas are not getting the oxygen and nutrients they need
to stay healthy. The result can be pain, numbness, slow healing,
and skin breakdown. 



 What is the standard of care for treatment of DPN? 



 Good glucose control is most important to prevent the
progression of neuropathy. If that doesn&apos;t reduce your symptoms,
then your doctor may prescribe drugs such as anti-depressants,
anti-seizure medications or topical ointments like capsaicin
cream. These drugs have been effective in relieving some painful
symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, studies have shown that
certain supplements like B12, folic acid and alpha lipoic acid may
also help reduce neuropathic symptoms. 



 Along with medical interventions, special shoes, custom
orthotics, and regular foot exams can protect feet from injuries
or relieve pressure points. Despite these treatments, the
majority of people suffering from PN continue to experience
worsening pain, skin breakdown and a decline in quality of life. 
However, a new option has offered thousands relief from the
symptoms of PN. 



 Monochromatic infrared energy (MIRE) may help! 



 MIRE is a photo-energy or light therapy used by doctors,
physical and occupational therapists, and wound care specialists
to increase circulation and reduce pain. The most promising
device, called Anodyne Therapy, is already cleared by the FDA and
holds a patent for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Nine
studies published or currently in press show its effectiveness. 
Six of the studies were conducted on over 1100 neuropathy
patients. 

 

 Why does MIRE work on neuropathy and pain? 



 It is believed this infrared wavelength of photo energy
increases the availability of nitric oxide by breaking it free
from the red blood cells. Once NO is free, it increases blood
flow to the area by up to 3200% in just 30 minutes. Over time, NO
will facilitate the growth of tiny new blood vessels (capillaries)
in the area, improving circulation with each treatment. If the
nerve pain is due to lack of circulation, then getting better
blood flow to them can have immediate results. The release of NO
also has a direct effect on pain itself. Several studies
published in the 1990s showed that NO was directly responsible for
the pain-relieving effect of morphine and similar drugs. 



 Is MIRE 100% effective? No, nothing in medical science is
100 percent. But clinical studies show a majority have positive
results. In fact, this technology is used by our U.S. military on
all types of injuries because they have found it gets soldiers
back to duty faster than any other therapy. 



 As a result of this clinical success, there are now over 2000
Anodyne Neuropathy Care Centers using MIRE nationwide. These
centers are located in hospitals, universities, rehabilitation
clinics, nursing homes, home health agencies, pain clinics, wound
care centers and doctors&apos; offices. 



 How do I get MIRE treatments? 



 The best way to start is with a trained therapist or doctor
who has experience using MIRE. They will begin with an individual
assessment of the difficulties you are experiencing due to your
neuropathy. They will ask you questions about your goals for
improvement and design a specialized therapy program to help you
reach those goals. 

 

 How long do the treatments take and what should I expect? 

 

 A comprehensive program usually involves 10 to 24 therapy
sessions with 30-45 minutes of Anodyne Therapy and may include any
or all of the following treatments depending on your particular
needs: 



 * MIRE to reduce pain and increase circulation to tissues and
nerves 



 * Stretching and strengthening exercises 



 * Dynamic and static balance exercises 



 * Massage and the use of other therapeutic modalities for pain 



 * Sensory integrative techniques to put it all together 



 Is this therapy for everyone? 



 MIRE has been safely used for over 10 years on thousands of
patients. No significant side effects or drug interactions have
been reported as long as MIRE is properly used and monitored. If
you have diabetes, check your blood sugars often during any
therapy or activity. If you are pregnant or have an active
cancer, there are special cautions when using this therapy. 
Always follow the directions of your doctor or therapist when
using MIRE. 



 Is this therapy reimbursed? 



 Medicare and most private insurance carriers will reimburse
for this therapy when you are being treated by a physical or
occupational therapist. In some cases, doctors can also be
reimbursed for treatments, however, that varies state by state.
You will need a prescription from your doctor for this therapy. 



 Will I need ongoing treatment? 



 Unfortunately, diabetes and most other causes of neuropathy
are chronic conditions. Your therapist or doctor will recommend
home exercises to improve your balance and ability to walk. They
may also suggest continued use of MIRE therapy at home for ongoing
pain relief and to help you maintain your peripheral circulation. 
Medicare or your private insurance may cover a MIRE home treatment
system with your doctor&apos;s prescription if you have shown
improvement during your clinical treatment program. 

 

 You do not have to suffer with neuropathy. By controlling
your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as
exercising and adding this promising photo-energy therapy to
increase circulation, you can make a difference in your life.

 DIABETES, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKE 

 By Ann S. Williams, MSN RN CDE 



 This column focuses on providing information to help people 

 make their diabetes care fit their needs and their lives. 



 This month&apos;s column will be shorter than usual. I need to
make an emergency trip out of town to see a relative who has just
had a stroke. He, like myself, and like many other members of my
family, has type 2 diabetes. So I want to take this opportunity
to write about the link between diabetes and cardiovascular
disease -- in other words, heart attacks and stroke. 



 Many people do not realize there is a very strong link 
between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. If you have 
diabetes, you have two to four times the risk of having a heart
attack or stroke than you would if you did not have diabetes. You
have two to four times the risk of having a heart attack or stroke
than you would if you did not have diabetes. You are much more
likely to die of heart attack or stroke than of diabetes itself. 



 In fact, your risk of heart attack or stroke is as high as
someone who has already had a heart attack or stroke. However,
there is a lot you can do to reduce your risk and protect your
health. 



 What can you do to avoid heart attack and stroke? 



 You need to reduce all the risks you can control. These
include: 



 1. Keep your blood sugar as close to normal as you can without
having too much hypoglycemia. It&apos;s good to aim for: 



 a. A1C: below 6.5. 

 

 b. Blood glucose readings before meals: under 110. 



 c. Blood glucose readings two hours after meals: under 140. 

 

 But if you get too much hypoglycemia at these levels, aim for
as close as you can reasonably get. 



 2. Do not smoke. If you do, quit. 



 3. Keep your blood pressure normal. 



 a. Blood pressure: under 130/80. 



 The goals for people with diabetes are lower than the goals
for everyone else, because of the increased risk. If your blood
pressure regularly runs higher than this, ask your diabetes
educator or doctor to help you learn how to control your blood
pressure through lifestyle changes or through a prescription
medication. 



 4. Keep your cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats) normal. 



 This is a complicated subject, which I will not discuss in
detail here. The goals are: 



 a. LDL cholesterol: less than 100. 



 b. HDL cholesterol: greater than 40 for men, and greater than
50 for women. 



 c. Triglycerides: under 150 



 If your cholesterol or triglycerides regularly run higher
than this, ask your diabetes educator or doctor to help you learn
how to control your cholesterol or triglycerides through lifestyle
changes or through a prescription medication. 



 5. Take a baby aspirin every day, unless you are allergic to it
or have had other bad effects from aspirin. 



 6. Move around! Be as active as you can. Make physical
activity an everyday part of your life. 



 7. Eat less fat in general, and especially less saturated fat
(fat that is hard at room temperature). 



 8. Eat more vegetables, especially low-calorie vegetables, and
fruit. The vegetables and fruits that are deeply colored are
especially good for you. For example, dark green, leafy
vegetables, deep orange winter squash, blueberries, raspberries,
and strawberries, and red watermelon all contain many vitamins and
minerals and other substances that help to protect against heart
attack and stroke. 



 9. Strive to reach and maintain a healthy weight. 



 I hope you all take the risk of heart attack and stroke very
seriously. As I think of my own aunts and uncles who had diabetes
(there were seven of them), I remember which ones worked at
controlling their heart risk factors, and which ones didn&apos;t. I
also remember which of them died when they were in their 40s and
50s, compared to the ones who lived well into their 80s. Now, as
I face another stroke in my family, thinking about my aunts and
uncles with diabetes who lived long and healthy lives provides me
with the motivation I need to keep up my efforts to control my
risk factors.

 DIABETES, FIRST IMPRESSIONS 

 by Fred MacDonald 



 I first learned I had type 2 diabetes on the night of October
9, 2003. I was resting in the local hospital with a severe
infection in my left big toe (the &quot;greater toe,&quot; on my medical
chart). Neuropathy had deadened the feeling in my feet to such an
extent I wasn&apos;t aware I&apos;d developed an infection in a small cut --
and that had led to gangrene. I was a very sick person. 



 Now I learned the surprising news that I was diabetic. I had
never shown any classic signs of the disease: excess thirst,
frequent urination, I was never overly tired, and my weight, 150
pounds, was not that heavy either. I knew of no history of
diabetes in my family, so I was stumped on how I had developed
this condition (a more detailed check of the family history
revealed one family member did develop diabetes, but only near the
end of his life, so this information was ignored). 



 With the word &quot;diabetes&quot; ringing in my ears, I realized
everything in my life was changed. I had always considered myself
fairly healthy, and now I was facing a disease that would always
be with me. As expected, my first reactions to the news were
equal bouts of anger and denial, but as I was currently suffering
from a serious side effect of the disease, it was hard to remain
in the state of denial for very long. 

 

 The anger took longer to channel out of my system. My
fiancee, and to a lesser extent my parents, had to deal with a
person who wanted to lash out at the world. The hospital staff
were doing a good job of treating the problems of my diabetes and
gangrene, but I wasn&apos;t a &apos;willing&apos; patient yet. I did what the
doctors and nurses wanted, but nothing more. I was simply in a
passive mode. 



 Julia, my fiancee, has dealt with low blood sugar for nearly
20 years, so she had some information about my new diagnosis. She
gave my mother a number of books and magazines, so she could learn
about my condition. Then, on one of her visits to the hospital,
she brought two books for me to look over. I&apos;m afraid her
suggestion that I read them didn&apos;t go down well at first (let&apos;s
just say that this was one of Julia&apos;s shorter visits). 



 As the days went by, my boredom started to take over, and
finally I decided to look at one of the books. The introduction
caught my attention -- this writer had the same problems I had. 

 

 I started to read like a person possessed. The information
was clear; there was humor in it as well. Side stories and case
notes made the work very easy to understand; but the best thing
was the tone of the book. Anger over the disease, denial, doubts,
and fears of the unknown, everything I&apos;d been feeling was there,
yet the volume also spoke of hope. 



 As I read more, my mood quickly changed. Yes, I had
diabetes; but it wasn&apos;t going to rule my life. I was going to be
its MASTER. 



 I spent time learning about my condition. My focus changed;
I now worked with the staff to get well as soon as possible. I
was determined to have a normal life again. 



 There were still serious problems. Since I had always been
healthy, I had very limited experience with the general health
care system. I learned I had to switch doctors, due to my
insurance coverage (before this event I had always paid out of my
own pocket for whatever care I needed). I was going to be out of
work for quite a while, so I had to set up the paper work for
short-term disability, but I was lucky, my insurance company had
always given very good coverage, and was willing to do almost
anything to help me get better, fast. 



 My employer&apos;s attitude was even better. Because I work for a
human service organization dealing with people with various
disabilities, they have a rather open attitude in dealing with
matters such as this. I was told to take care of myself. My job
would be waiting for me on my return. 



 My friends and family made certain I was visited regularly at
the hospital. Get-well cards and gifts arrived, to keep my spirits
up, but there were long periods of loneliness. Time seemed to
stand still, every once in a while, and I kept hoping this would
be the day I would finally get out of the hospital. 



 There was good reason for the delay. The infection in my
foot was lessening, but was still powerful enough to pose a risk
to my general health. Finally, one of the staff members made the
decision to bring in a foot surgeon. After a careful review of
the case notes and a glance at my foot itself, the specialist
stated removal of the toe was my best option. 

 

 I told him I wanted the surgery done as soon as possible, so
one day after being discharged from the hospital, I was back in,
getting my left toe removed. 



 The infection was so strong that, besides having the toe
removed, the doctor had to cut off two additional inches, to
scrape the infection out of the good bone. After an extra day of
bed rest, came the long road of home health care. 



 While it was good to be out of the hospital room, I still had
to deal with many doctor appointments, paperwork for the insurance
company, moving around on crutches, and keeping my injured foot up
as much as possible. I discovered I was considered a &quot;fast
healer,&quot; for a diabetic, yet it seemed to me things were moving at
a snail&apos;s pace. Finally, in early November, I was allowed out of
the house to go to a local science fiction convention. I still had
trouble moving around, but being around my friends and talking
about something other than my diabetes did wonders for my spirits. 
Life was slowly returning to a more normal existence. 



 The holiday season was a bit strained, due to my limited
ability to get around; but on the plus side, my oral medications
were doing a good job of controlling my sugar levels. I could eat
almost everything I wanted, as long as the quantities were
limited. Yes, there were some things I had to give up; but if I
needed a reminder about what could happen, all I had to do was
look down at my left foot. 



 At the start of the new year, I went to another surgeon, to
see what could be done with the large open wound on my foot. A
surface skin graft was discussed; but the wound had to close up
some more before the attempt could be made, thus more waiting.
During this time, I often met with a diabetes educator to learn
more about my new lifestyle, and with a dietitian, to deal with my
food concerns. 

 

 Upon being discharged from the hospital, I had been placed on
a 2000-calorie meal plan, but this had left me underweight. I was
currently 137 pounds, and most of my regular clothes were too
loose on me. I couldn&apos;t increase my carbs that much or my sugar
levels would spike. Even by eating a lot of extra meat my weight
wasn&apos;t going up. Finally, the sugar-free energy shakes were
approved for my use. There are two types -- one to lose weight,
and one to gain. Needless to say, I was given the latter. These
shakes, taken twice a day, with some extra food, finally brought
my weight to a more normal level. I&apos;m still roughly five to eight
pounds under my old weight of 150 pounds, but at least I look okay
in my clothes now. 



 By mid-January my wound had healed enough to try the skin
graft. The procedure was a limited success. For the first week it
appeared the skin graft was going to take with no problem, but
during the second week it started to fail. By the end of week
three, most of the skin graft was dead, but as it died, it acted
like a bandage, allowing the tissue underneath it to knit together
faster. I still had a decent size wound, but its depth had
decreased. This was a setback, but by now I was getting used to
them. 



 Near the end of January, I was permitted to return to work.
It had been almost four months, and I wondered if I would be able
to do all my duties. I quickly discovered that it wasn&apos;t a big
problem. Walking around the various work sites on crutches was
difficult, but I could do it. My strength wasn&apos;t back up to full
potential yet, but I had enough to get by. I was also very lucky
there was very little snow or ice in my state that year. 



 After a few more weeks another great day came -- I was told I
could put my crutches away and use a cane. My sense of freedom
grew. Now I could carry something in my free hand. 



 The wound kept healing, at a fairly stable rate, but I was
getting a bit frustrated. I was still wearing winter ski boots
because of the dressing on my left foot. However, warmer weather
was now in the area and my feet started to get very warm. At one
point, I tried a pair of my dad&apos;s extra wide sneakers instead, but
after two days I noticed some breakdown in the surrounding tissue,
so I put the boots back on. 



 Currently I&apos;m at a point where my injury is almost completely
healed. I have been allowed to switch into any type of shoe, as
long as it doesn&apos;t put any strain on the healing tissue. My sugar
levels are under control, and there are not other signs of the
dangerous side effects of diabetes. I have even regained a good
sense of feeling in both feet. I was lucky my body has been able
to repair itself. Even though I lost my big toe, my balance is
still good, so I don&apos;t believe I will need special shoes. I also
have friends, family, and co-workers ready to help me at a
moment&apos;s notice. 



 Yes, I would prefer not to have diabetes; but I have learned
some important guidelines about living with this condition. First
is to seek out any information relating to the problems you have. 
With the data, you can make a better decision on the various
problems diabetes throws at you. Second, remember diabetes is
something you can LIVE WITH. There will be days the world seems
against you, and you may want to give up dealing with your
diabetes. DON&apos;T GIVE INTO THOSE FEELINGS. Talk to a doctor, a
family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone who can give you a
different viewpoint. It&apos;s true you have diabetes, but you don&apos;t
have to deal with it just by yourself. Other people can help. 



 As one person told me: &quot;With diabetes you have two kinds of
people. The ones who work with their doctors, and the ones who
don&apos;t. Doctors are more willing to work with people who take an
active interest in the treatment of the disease, than to deal with
the ones who just half-follow their advice.&quot; 



 This seem a pretty good standard for the care of diabetes. Be
willing to work on the problem and you&apos;ll feel better, and most
likely have a longer and better life. Do little or nothing and you
start on the slow side to an early death. The final choice is your
own.

 A WORTHWHILE BOOK 

 by Peter J. Nebergall, PhD 



 DIABETIC EYE DISEASE: Lessons From A Diabetic Eye Doctor, by
A. Paul Chous, MA, OD. Fairwood Press, 2003. Price: $15.99 plus
shipping, available from Fairwood Press (www.fairwoodpress.com) or
from Dr. Chous at: (www.diabeticeyes.com); or at telephone: (425)
432-5929. 



 There is usually a yawning (pun intended) gap between
&quot;professional&quot; medical literature and the &quot;dumbed-down&quot; texts
doctors put out for the consumer. The motivated consumer, who
really wants to know, but lacks medical training, often has to
choose between incomprehension and disappointment. Not here. Not
this time. Dr. Chous comes to his material from both sides. He
is a trained medical professional, ready to help you save your
eyes; but he also is a diabetic, with personal experience. 



 His book covers basic definitions of diabetes and eye
disease, the forms of damage diabetes can take, and what to do
about preventing or minimizing eye damage. He shows how diabetes
does what it does to the eyes - and what you ought to do about it. 
He details what you should expect from your eye doctor, and from
your examination. 



 Spread throughout the book are his uniquely useful
observations, like the fact that changes in blood sugar control
can alter eye-test results, causing rapid apparent changes in
&quot;prescription.&quot; He discusses LASIK corrective eye surgery, and
the fact it may not be a really good idea for diabetics. He feels
the same about contact lenses - that they present additional
problems when diabetes is present. And there is much more. 



 If you are truly motivated to manage your diabetes, if you
are one of those people who practices &quot;tight control,&quot; uses a
sliding scale to get the best possible control, this book is for
you. There&apos;s a lot of material in here, but none of it &quot;out of
reach&quot; - so take the time, go through it, and put his suggestions
into practice. This book has my highest recommendation.

 DEALING WITH DIABETES DAY-TO-DAY 

 by Emily Gaines Buchler 

 (includes photo of Emily Gaines Buchler) 



 In 1912, my grandmother&apos;s aunt, Grace Goforth, died on a
small farm in the foothills of North Carolina. What did this have
to do with me? Diabetes. 



 Grace had grown up like any other kid on a farm. She rose
early to milk cows and cultivate seeds, delivered bread four miles
on foot to the nearest neighbor, and played rounds of Kick the Can
and Ante Over for fun. At age 18, she fell in love with George, a
young man who traveled to town by horse and buggy to sell the
tobacco, milk, chicken, and eggs produced by the Goforth farm and
other establishments in the area. 



 Soon after, Grace started accompanying George from the
country to town, and it was during this 30-mile stretch she first
felt the pangs of diabetes. She complained of thirst, stopped
frequently to urinate, and slept the whole trip back, despite
bumps and holes in the winding dirt road. Within one year, Grace
dropped from a robust 130 pounds to just below 100, and when she
finally saw a doctor, on the eve of her twentieth birthday, her
condition was grave. On May 16, 1912, Grace slipped into a coma
and died. 



 My grandmother first mentioned Grace a few years after my own
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in 1983. She started her story by
stressing my luck in developing diabetes in the late twentieth
century and not earlier. &quot;My aunt Grace,&quot; my grandmother would
say, &quot;lived before insulin was even available. Can you imagine
your own life without insulin?&quot; 



 As a nine-year-old, happy-go-lucky kid who loved to showcase
her ability to inject insulin without crying, thoughts of dying
from diabetes never crossed my mind. I viewed Grace as a mystery
and wondered if she really had diabetes, or if some sort of cancer
or heart failure had in fact claimed her life. 



 Reaching the 20-year milestone of my life with diabetes, I
realize the deadly consequences of the disease. At the same time,
I feel fortunate to live in the era of insulin and blood glucose
monitoring systems. Had Grace held out for another ten years, she
might have lengthened her life with injections of insulin, the
wonder drug invented in 1921 by Banting and Best and mass-produced
the next year by Eli Lilly and Company. 



 The invention of insulin transformed diabetes from a deadly
disease to a chronic illness. Prior to 1922, a diagnosis of
diabetes meant death. Pre-insulin era patients were put on
&quot;starvation diets&quot; of lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cucumbers, and
other low-carbohydrate foods. Subsisting on less than 900
calories a day, most of these patients wasted away within a year
from starvation and acidosis. 



 By the 1940s, the average life-span approached the non-diabetic &quot;normal,&quot; due to the development of longer-acting and
purer forms of insulin. Yet diabetes treatment was not as we know
it today. There was no home blood glucose monitoring equipment,
and assessing the level of sugar in the body could only be done
through urine tests, or through a (very slow) hospital pathology
lab. 



 By the time sugar showed up in the urine, it had long since
entered the bloodstream, making the result far less &quot;immediate&quot;
than those results read by meters today. Nevertheless, as the
only means of regularly assessing sugar, home urine tests were
administered every morning, afternoon, evening, and night. 



 Obtaining the result required more than peeing on a strip and
watching it turn color. It required a rigmarole of steps that
took close to ten minutes. The most widely used urine test was
the Benedict test, which included a test tube, dropper, and a
bottle of Benedict solution. 



 After collecting a urine sample, patients used the dropper to
transfer eight to ten drops of urine to a test tube containing a
teaspoon of the Benedict solution. The mixture was then heated to
a boil for three minutes, after which it cooled and turned color. 
Blue indicated no sugar, while green indicated a trace, and orange
and red revealed an excess. 



 Phil Johnson, a native of Charlotte, North Carolina,
diagnosed with diabetes 50 years ago, remembers a variation of the
Benedict test: &quot;All the mixing of solutions and dropping of urine
from one test tube to another really took a lot of time. But the
worst part of the whole experience was waiting for that dreaded
orange color. If the color turned out blue, I rewarded myself and
felt proud, but if the color turned out orange or red, I felt like
I&apos;d been bad.&quot; 



 Along with the lengthy urine testing, preparing syringes for
injecting took much longer back then, too. Phil recalls getting up
early before school to boil a pot of water to sterilize the glass
barrel and steel piston of the syringe, along with the steel
needle. &quot;The old steel needles weren&apos;t like the sharp little
needles we have today,&quot; Phil says. &quot;The old needles were thick,
and they felt like ice picks!&quot; 



 After injecting the insulin, Phil remembers rinsing the
needle and syringe in cold water, while a burning sensation
lingered for several minutes beneath the surface of his skin. 

 

 A cartoon produced in the late 1920s by Guy Rainsford, a
traveling salesman from Maine, and patient of the renowned
diabetes doctor, Elliott Joslin, depicts this kind of early
diabetes treatment. Test tubes, droppers, and bottles of Benedict
solution line the table, transforming an ordinary home into a
scientific laboratory. A larger-than-life syringe and needle
pierce the top of Rainsford&apos;s knee, while a caption reads: &quot;Here
goes, folks.&quot; 



 Despite the hassle of preparing the treatment and the painful
poke of the needle, the patient maintains a hearty sense of humor.
In the lower center of the page, he informs his audience that his
slippers came from Japan, and cost only 19 cents, and he bids
onlookers a friendly &quot;cheerio.&quot; 

 

 Sharper needles, disposable syringes, and home glucose
monitoring systems are not the only major changes in treatment
over the years. The emergence of diabetes specialists represents
another major advancement. As Phil Johnson recalls: &quot;When I was
little, there was no such thing as a diabetes educator, and there
were certainly no diabetes camps or support groups. I saw a family
doctor, and he just didn&apos;t have the kind of handle on diabetes
that many specialists have today. I&apos;ll never forget that first
week in the hospital when he told me I&apos;d never eat a candy bar or
piece of birthday cake again. As a kid, that really killed me, and
it and made me that much more tempted to sneak.&quot; 



 My own week in the hospital, during my initial diagnosis of
diabetes, left me envisioning, like Phil, a life without sweets.
&quot;I can&apos;t eat sugar,&quot; I told my best friend, Barry. &quot;I can eat
sugar-free cake and ice cream, and my mom makes sugar-free
pudding, but I can&apos;t have any other sweets.&quot; In the 20-plus years
since my diagnosis, faster-acting insulin and carbohydrate
counting have given diabetics more opportunity to incorporate
desserts into their diet. 



 Aaron Corns, a recently diagnosed 14-year-old from Tomah,
Wisconsin, confessed to worrying more about not eating sugar than
the box of 100 syringes placed on his bedside table the first week
of treatment. &quot;My grandmother has type 2 diabetes, and I always
associated the disease with not eating sugar. I was pleasantly
surprised when my doctor finally told me that diabetes doesn&apos;t
mean I can&apos;t have sugar. It just means I can&apos;t have it all the
time.&quot; 

 

 Given the recent rise in popularity among the Atkins diet and
other low-carbohydrate plans, a wide range of low sugar-desserts
now line most grocery store shelves, making it that much easier to
satisfy cravings without taking in an excess of carbs. Growing up
in the seventies and eighties, my dessert options included Jell-O
pudding, Sweet&apos;n Low ice cream, and a few Estee brand products --
all of which contained large doses of sickeningly sweet saccharin. 

 

 The &quot;diabetic food exchange&quot; adorned the side labels of these
products. Eating a piece of sugar-free cake meant giving up a
piece of bread for dinner, while indulging in chocolate pudding
meant going without a helping of potatoes. 

 

 In this pre-carbohydrate counting era, diabetics exercised
much less control over what, and when, they ate. Their medication
determined both schedule and amount. As a child and teenager, I
ate when my Regular and NPH insulin peaked: breakfast at seven, a
mid-morning snack, lunch at noon, a mid-afternoon snack, dinner at
six-thirty, and a bedtime snack around nine. My daytime snacks
consisted of apples and crackers with cheese, while my bedtime
snacks included a cup of sugar-free hot chocolate and ginger snaps
with peanut butter. I ate this same series of snacks for ten
years, with little-to-no variation. 



 Although today&apos;s doctors advise people with diabetes to
follow regular eating routines, the development of Humalog insulin
made mealtime planning a lot more flexible. Approved by the FDA
in 1996, Humalog takes an average of 15 minutes to take effect,
compared to the 45-minute lag with Regular insulin. 



 Mandy Hunter, a part-time pharmaceutical consultant and
mother of a six-month-old daughter, designated Humalog the
greatest advancement in diabetes treatment since her diagnosis in
the mid 1980s: &quot;My body never responded well to Regular insulin,
which peaked three hours after my meals,&quot; Mandy recalls. &quot;As a
kid, I remember going low almost every day, on my way to the
school cafeteria for lunch. Taking Humalog really changed that. It
lets me eat when I&apos;m hungry, instead of when my insulin peaks.&quot; 



 Warren Prickett, a 29-year-old type 1 diabetic diagnosed in
1991, sees little room for improvement in daily diabetes
management. &quot; We&apos;re almost at a peak,&quot; Warren says. &quot;Daily
management is almost maxed-out. Needles are as small and sharp as
they can get, the pump delivers doses in one-tenth of a unit, and
glucose monitors give results in five seconds. The way I see it,
there&apos;s just one way to go, and that&apos;s for people with diabetes
not to have diabetes.&quot; 



 Although Warren anticipates a cure, he also welcomes the
development of a way to gauge blood sugar without stopping to draw
blood. &quot;Knowing my blood sugar level at all times would make a
huge difference in my treatment,&quot; Warren says. &quot;If I was sitting
in a business meeting and noticed my blood sugar climbing, I could
give a little dose of insulin before it climbed too high. I could
prevent highs and lows, and maintain readings in the normal range,
like people without diabetes.&quot; 



 Frequent or continuous glucose monitoring, multiple
injections throughout the day, and the widespread use of insulin
pumps characterize the new wave of diabetes treatment. Tighter
control is now possible, improving the quality of life and
preventing complications. 



 Although tighter control leads to a longer, healthier life,
it does require work; but when I weigh the alternatives, diabetes
management is worth every ounce of hard work. As the renowned
diabetes doctor, Elliott Joslin, wrote in his DIABETIC MANUAL of
1959, &quot;Work shortens the day, but lengthens the life.&quot; In an era
of constant monitoring and tight control, his words ring true in
many ways. 



 Dealing with diabetes is not a walk in the park, and it&apos;s
easy to get discouraged from the day-to-day roller-coaster of the
disease. As we continue to hope for a cure, either through islet
transplant or some other means, we should feel fortunate to live
with the many advancements in diabetes management that have
occurred over the years. We do not boil water to sterilize
syringes in the morning; we do not sharpen needles on a whetstone;
and we do not rely on urine tests to determine our insulin and
dietary needs. Grace Goforth, along with the many other people
diagnosed with diabetes in the pre-insulin era, literally wasted
away from the disease. Thanks to medical science, grassroots
efforts, and other invaluable measures, we continue to go forth in
our quest for better control and healthier lives.

 ASK THE DOCTOR 

 by Wesley W. Wilson, MD 

 (includes art: Medical caduceus symbol) 



 NOTE: If you have any questions for &quot;Ask the Doctor,&quot; please send
them to the VOICE editorial office. The only questions Dr. Wilson
will be able to answer are the ones used in this column. 

 

 Wesley W. Wilson, MD, has retired as an Internal Medicine
practitioner at the Western Montana Clinic in Missoula, Montana. 
Dr. Wilson was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1956, during his
second year of medical school. He remains interested and involved
in diabetes education for patients and professionals. 



 Q: I have type 2 diabetes. Most of my life I&apos;ve been a real
type &quot;A&quot; person, full of conflicts and stresses. Well, I&apos;ve been
seriously reducing the stresses in my life, and now my foot
problems are a lot less, and my blood sugars are better. Is this
valid? What is the link between being a high-stress type person
and good blood sugar management? What happens when I achieve a
lower stress lifestyle? 



 A. Congratulations on being able to achieve a lower stress
lifestyle. Now tell us how you did it! Changing a life-long
behavior pattern is very difficult. Many people wish they could
somehow control the stresses and problems in their lives but can&apos;t
find the way to change their responses to the troubles and
concerns we all must deal with. This is particularly true since
individuals vary so much in their response to problems or
stresses. 

 

 Hormonal changes do occur with a &quot;high-stress&quot; state. 
Increases in epinephrine, cortisone and growth hormone may be seen
with stress and anxiety. But even more important, I&quot;d feel, is
the effect anxiety can have on your attention to the routines
required to maintain your diabetic control. Careful attention to
diet, exercise, and blood sugar testing is much harder during
periods of stress than it is when things are on a fairly even,
smooth routine. 



 Certainly you are the one to answer the validity question. 
Perhaps the most convenient way to determine the degree of
improved control is to compare a hemoglobin A1c taken after
several months on your lower stress period with a previous HbA1c
taken during a higher stress time. You can get some idea of
control by looking back on your blood sugar diary; but the HbA1c
gives a more accurate look at your degree of control over a
several-month time period. That&apos;s why physicians use the HbA1c
to check on diabetic control. 

 

 It&apos;s generally agreed that some high-stress situations lead
to higher blood sugar levels. Surgery, a heart attack, or an
acute illness do lead to higher blood sugars, and these often
require greater efforts to control blood sugar. Emotional turmoil
has a similar effect on blood sugar. 

 

 So, to answer your question, lowering your stress level is
good for you, good for your heart, and good for your diabetes
control.

 NEW TREATMENT FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS 

 by Stephen A. Brigido, DPM. 



 What are diabetic foot ulcers? 



 Diabetic foot ulcers are slow-to-heal sores, appearing on the
foot or ankle, as a result of a combination of loss of nervous
sensation and poor circulation. This serious side-effect of
diabetes afflicts 15 percent of the diabetic population, and is
the primary cause of hospital admissions for all diabetics. Over
80,000 lower-limb amputations occur each year in the diabetic
population, 85 percent of which are preceded by foot ulcers that
are not treated sufficiently. The good news is that new treatment
options now exist to heal diabetic foot ulcers before they become
infected and necessitate amputation. 



 How do you treat diabetic foot ulcers? 



 Conventional treatment for diabetic foot ulcers includes
removal and cleansing of the affected tissue, dressing the wound
and off-loading the treated foot in a special cast or off-loading
boot until the wound heals sufficiently. In patients where these
treatments fail to close the wound, the chance of infection and
amputation are increased, and patients are forced to make
additional trips to their physicians&apos; offices, burdening their
schedules and pocketbooks. For these reasons, more aggressive
treatment options have been developed. One of the more aggressive
treatments on the market is an ulcer repair matrix called
GRAFTJACKET, which has been shown to heal foot ulcers after just
one application of the graft. 



 What is GRAFTJACKET? 



 The GRAFTJACKET family of products is composed of human
dermal tissue components, and is readily accepted by the body. It
serves as a repair matrix that is rapidly converted to the
patient&apos;s own tissue by quickly renewing blood, cellular and
nutrient activity throughout the matrix. Over time, the tissue
graft aids in the repair of the wound and is replaced by tissue
like the patient&apos;s own. 



 What benefits does GRAFTJACKET offer to patients and physicians? 



 GRAFTJACKET can require only one application to repair a
diabetic foot ulcer -- reducing the time and cost of recovery. 
Additionally, GRAFTJACKET Ulcer Repair Matrix is a strong tissue
graft, which results in improved suture retention and higher
likelihood of a successful repair. 



 To learn more about treating diabetic foot ulcers, or about
GRAFTJACKET®, contact Stephen A. Brigido, DPM, at 570-420-8080, or

 LIVING WITH DIABETES 50 YEARS 

 by Pat Oswald 



 I, Pat Oswald, of Marysville, Kansas, recently received two
medals for having lived with type 1 diabetes for five decades (50
years). I received recognition both from the maker of my insulin,
the Eli Lilly Company, of Indianapolis, Indiana (who awarded me
the &quot;Lilly for Life 50 Year Insulin Award&quot;), and also from the
Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, Massachusetts, that awarded me
the &quot;Joslin 50-Year Medal and Certificate of Achievement.&quot; 



 Fifty years of dealing with diabetes has not been an easy
task; but I have done pretty much everything in life non-diabetics
could do: job, family, children. Sometimes it has meant more
finger sticks and a snack, here and there. You do what you need to
do. 



 Exactly 50 years ago, in November 1953, I was having all the
symptoms of diabetes -- frequent urination, hunger, fatigue, loss
of weight, thirst, and I was irritable. My parents took me to the
doctor, a small-town physician, who treated me for a few weeks for
a supposed kidney infection. Since I continued to get worse, he
then did a urinalysis, which showed a lot of sugar. I was
diagnosed with diabetes. 



 At the time I was diagnosed, I was the only child in the area
with diabetes. I was a child of 12 years, growing up in the rural
area near Winside and Carroll, Nebraska, a place of small farmers,
near Norfolk, Nebraska. 



 In 1955, my parents, Forrest and Bessie Nettleton, took me to
Dr. William J. Lear&apos;s office in Norfolk, Nebraska. He was just out
of medical college, freshly trained. Dr. Lear turned out to be one
of the many &quot;great doctors&quot; in my life. He taught me so much, and
contributed to my complication-free 50 years with diabetes. Of
all the complications, my biggest fear has been that of losing my
eyesight. So far, I have very good eyes and health, thanks, I am
sure, to the good advice of my doctors. 



 I never feared insulin injections, and I still have my very
first insulin kit-the glass syringe and needles I used back then.
We had to boil the syringe and needles in soft water before each
use. My family did not have soft water, so I would walk 3/4 of a
mile to a neighbor&apos;s farm, with a gallon jar in hand to get my
supply of soft water from their soft water cistern. The walk was
good exercise, and was part of my treatment. 



 My parents never gave me an insulin injection. I have done it
myself from day one, except when hospitalized. 



 At the time I was diagnosed, there were no home glucose
monitors. Sugars were checked with a urinalysis test using five
drops of urine, 10 drops of water, and a pill purchased at the
pharmacy. If it boiled to blue, you were negative. Green meant a
trace of sugar and bright orange meant a lot of sugar. Urine
tests measured spillover of sugar from the blood excreted by the
kidneys. Home glucose meters and small finger sticks are much
better -- they tell you the amount of sugar in your blood at that
moment. I&apos;d never want to go back to urine tests, even though
blood glucose test are more expensive. 



 So much has changed since the early days: meal plans,
treatments, and technology, as well as the price we pay for
medications and supplies. Diabetes is an individual disease, and
must be treated as such. 



 Over the 50 years I&apos;ve had diabetes, what has remained
constant is the need for daily exercise, which I do by walking my
treadmill, taking a pleasant walk, or riding the exercise cycle.
My job at the local motel helps as well, since I do much walking
there, and climb steps each day. 



 My advice to others is to follow your treatment plan, be open
with your physician, ask questions, and be honest with your
diabetes care team. Be sure to get an answer you understand to all
your questions. 



 I have only been hospitalized a couple of times for my
diabetes. They were when I was running a lot of very low blood
sugars. My doctor could not get me regulated, so I was sent to a
diabetes treatment center in Wichita, Kansas. There I was re-evaluated, and steered back into good control. Such problems can
occur in life&apos;s changes. 



 Diabetes has made me a stronger person. It has been a daily
challenge, and has helped me learn how to cope with living.
Diabetes is much easier to control now than it was 50 years ago.
There were no sugar-free foods then, nor sugar substitutes for
sweetener, except saccharin, which tasted awful. Much more is
known now, about diet, exercise, and diabetes control, than was
known in my rural area in 1953. 



 Family support has been a big plus all my life. We have
always eaten foods that fit into my meal plan and ate on time. 



 You could say diabetes is &quot;popular&quot; in my family. My great-grandmother, on my dad&apos;s side of the family, had diabetes. Five of
his sisters had it. One had type 1, and the others had type 2. My
husband, Ed, has type 2. Douglas, the elder of our two sons, has
had type 1 since age 14 (almost 29 years). Daniel, our younger,
doesn&apos;t have it. 



 We also have a pet cat living with diabetes. I give him two
insulin injections per day, and monitor his food intake. 



 There is so much to be thankful for. Most of it is what
people take for granted, but I&apos;ve learned to appreciate. And I
keep busy. I work five to six days a week for 7-1/2 to 8 hours a
day, plus home upkeep -- canning, mowing, etc. 



 Over the years, I served as Marshall County Diabetes Chapter
American Diabetes President. I set up monthly meetings, an annual
fund-raising bike ride and walk, and annual seminars with diabetes
specialists presenting the day&apos;s program. I was president for
about 15 years (The chapter is no longer going). 



 I do have much to be thankful for. And I&apos;m far from finished
with the list.

 AMPUTATIONS DUE TO DIABETES CAN BE PREVENTED 

 (This story courtesy of the ACFAS NEWS, published by the
American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.) 



 For National Diabetes month, the American College of Foot and
Ankle Surgeons urges diabetic patients to take simple precautions
to help save their feet. Taking a minute or two every day to
inspect your feet and observing a few simple rules can make the
difference in sparing diabetes patients from a preventable outcome
of the disease -- a foot amputation. 

 

 Of all diabetes-related complications, a serious foot ulcer
and subsequent amputation might be the most preventable with
proper care and vigilance in checking the feet at least once a day
for small cuts and other abrasions, said Troy J. Boffeli, DPM,
FACFAS, a Minneapolis-based foot and ankle surgeon speaking for
the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Even those with
good control of their blood sugar can experience foot ulcers,
especially if neuropathy, a frequent diabetes complication, has
caused decreased feeling on the bottom of their feet. 



 Loss of sensation inhibits the body&apos;s normal pain response.
As a result, walking can apply repetitive, unfelt pressure to a
wound, making it larger and deeper. Left untreated, diabetic
ulcers lead to serious infections, which may result in amputation. 



 Boffeli said foot and ankle surgeons use a variety of
surgical and non-surgical methods to heal diabetic ulcers, but
stressed early intervention yields the most favorable outcomes.
&quot;Daily self-exams are the best protection. Too often, patients
fail to check their feet for small cuts or punctures that, over
time, will ulcerate and become infected,&quot; said Boffeli. &quot;If you
have diabetes and see anything suspicious on your feet, consult a
foot and ankle surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. Even a few
days can make a difference in preventing serious foot problems
from developing.&quot; 



 An estimated 7 in 10 diabetic patients have nerve damage that
impairs feeling in their feet. Fifteen percent of diabetic
patients eventually will develop a foot ulcer. Among those with
ulcers, one in four will lose a foot. Each year more than 86,000
amputations are performed as a direct result of diabetes; and
studies show half of those who have a foot or a leg amputated will
lose the other within five years. Proper diabetic foot care, says
Boffeli, prevents foot loss. 



 In some cases, amputations might be the preferred option. If
vascular and podiatric surgeries can&apos;t improve blood circulation,
resolve infection or restore foot function, amputations may be the
only solution that enables the patient to heal. Today, advances in
prosthetics make it possible for patients to return to an active
lifestyle, a necessity for keeping diabetes under control. 



 Foot problems are not an inevitable consequence of diabetes.
The risk can be lessened significantly by following a few simple
precautions: 



 * Keep your blood sugar under control to help minimize
cardiovascular and blood circulation problems. 



 * Lose weight, don&apos;t smoke, and adhere to prescribed dietary,
medication and exercise regimens. 



 * At least once a day, examine your feet for cuts and other
small wounds you may not feel. 



 * Never walk barefoot, outdoors or indoors. 



 * Cut nails carefully -- straight across and not too short;
never trim corns and calluses yourself. 



 * Wash your feet every day in lukewarm water; dry carefully. 



 * Choose comfortable shoes with adequate room for the toes. 



 * Wear clean, dry, non-bulky socks; change daily. 



 * Shake pebbles or bits of gravel out of your shoes before
wearing. 



 * Seek treatment from a foot and ankle surgeon if minor cuts
and sore spots don&apos;t seem to be healing.

 HEALTHY HOME COOKING 

 by JoAnna M. Lund 

 (includes photo, portrait of JoAnna Lund) 



 Welcome back into my kitchen, where the cooking is easy and
the food is both healthy and tasty! I have more cooking tips to
share with you, and a few recipe makeovers I&apos;ve gladly recreated
for others in the Healthy Exchanges way. I hope you enjoy, and
maybe, just maybe, some of my tips will help make the winter seem
shorter! 



 Somehow a soothing cup of hot chocolate seems to chase the
cold winter winds away. I have a quick and easy way to spruce up
that dull mug of fat- and sugar-free hot chocolate mix. After
combining the dry chocolate mix and the hot water, stir in a 1/2
teaspoon of vanilla extract, and give it a light sprinkle of
ground cinnamon. If you really want to &quot;live decadent,&quot; top it
all off with one tablespoon of cool Whip Lite. Sit back in your
favorite comfortable chair and savor every sip. It truly is
nectar for the spirit! 



 For the most heavenly-tasting fruit topping in the world, try
stirring 1/2-cup of any flavor of spreadable fruit into a small
bowl (remember to look for it in the jelly section of the
grocery), and then stir in one cup of Cool Whip Lite. If you
really want to impress others, then add one teaspoon of coconut or
almond extract. Refrigerate until you are ready to serve, then
spoon a couple of tablespoons on top of a slice of angel food
cake, and garnish with either 1/2-teaspoon of flaked coconut or
slivered almonds. Everyone will think you slaved for hours in
the kitchen for this sensational treat. Only you will know
differently -- unless you share our secret with them. 



 Did you know that if you lightly spray the inside of paper
baking cups with butter-flavored cooking spray before spooning
muffin batter into them, you won&apos;t end up with clinging paper on
your freshly baked muffins? If you like muffins as much as I do,
but hate washing muffin tins like I do, you probably will think
this idea is worth its weight in muffin batter! 



 To help keep fresh fruits and veggies fresh, just give them a
quick &quot;shower&quot; with lemon juice. The easiest way to do this is to
pour purchased lemon juice into a kitchen spray bottle and store
in the refrigerator. Then, anytime you use fresh fruits or
vegetables for salad or dessert, simply give them a quick spray
with your &quot;Lemon Spritzer.&quot; You just might be amazed by how this
little trick keeps your produce from turning brown so fast. 



 Did you know you can make purchased fat-free salad dressings
taste more like &quot;the real thing&quot; by adding a small amount of
fat-free mayonnaise and a pinch of sugar substitute to the diet
dressing? If you want exact portions, I&apos;d start with two
tablespoons fat-free salad dressing (any flavor and any brand) and
add one teaspoon fat-free mayonnaise and sugar substitute to equal
1/2-teaspoon sugar. Mix well and spoon over your salad. Unless
you remind yourself that you&apos;re eating &quot;diet&quot; dressing, you just
may fool yourself into thinking you reached for the high-fat
counterpart by mistake! 



 I thought I should share an ultra easy tip I just take for
granted, but that amazed some folks in the audience recently when
I was doing a cooking demo. Whenever you are preparing a pie
with the purchased pie crusts, simply tear out the paper label on
the plastic cover (check it out for a coupon for savings on a
future purchase) and turn the cover upside down over the prepared
pie. You now have a cover that protects the beautifully
garnished pie from having anything fall on top of it. It also
makes the pie very portable when taking to a get-together when
it&apos;s your turn to bring dessert. 



 Now for our Recipe Makeovers 



 CM, of TN, wanted me to revise a traditional meatball recipe
so that not only was it healthier -- it was also easier! She
wanted to have them already cooked and frozen, so she could get
supper on the table fast after a hard day at work. I think you&apos;ll
agree these meatballs hit the spot not only for spaghetti, but for
meatball sandwiches as well! 



 Ultra Quick Meatballs 



 16 ounces extra-lean ground sirloin or turkey breast 

 1 cup + 2 tablespoons dried fine bread crumbs 

 1/2-cup fat-free milk 

 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes 

 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

flakes, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well to combine. Form into
36 (1-inch) meatballs. Place meatballs in a large skillet sprayed
with butter-flavored cooking spray. Brown meatballs on all sides. 
Lower heat and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally. 
Freezes well.

 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

 3/4 cup Kraft fat-free mayonnaise 

 1 (4-serving) package JELL-O sugar-free instant banana pudding mix 

 1/2 cup Cool Whip Lite 



 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-by-9-inch cake pan
with butter-flavored cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine
2/3-cup dry milk powder, 1/2-cup water, and vinegar. Set aside. 
In a large bowl, combine flour, cocoa, Splenda, baking soda, and 2
tablespoons chopped pecans. In a medium bowl, combine mashed
bananas, vanilla extract, and mayonnaise. Stir in milk mixture. 



 Add banana mixture to flour mixture. Mix well to combine. 
Spread batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes
or until a toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Place
cake pan on a wire rack and allow to cool completely. In a medium
bowl, combine dry pudding mix, remaining 2/3-cup dry milk powder,
and remaining 1-cup water. Mix well using a wire whisk. Blend in
Cool Whip Light. Spread mixture evenly over cooled cake. 
Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons pecans over top. Cut into 12
servings. Refrigerate leftovers; freezes well. 



 Serves 12. Each serving equals:

 BOOK REVIEWS 

 by Marilyn Helton 



 Greetings and welcome to 2005! As we start our journey through
another year, I can&apos;t help but wonder how many of you are newly
diagnosed with diabetes and have postponed any lifestyle changes you
need until &quot;after the holidays.&quot; It&apos;s a perfectly normal reaction,
so don&apos;t feel too guilty about it. My job is to help you find the
resources to better cope with the many changes you&apos;ll be
experiencing in finding a new and healthier lifestyle. 



 A commitment to change begins with a dedicated, positive
mindset, so the first book on my January list of recommendations is
365 DAILY MEDITATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES, by Catherine Feste,
published by the American Diabetes Association. Catherine speaks
from her own experience of over 30 years as a health educator, who
has also lived with diabetes for 47 years. Author of THE PHYSICIAN
WITHIN and a co-author of 101 COPING TIPS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES,
Catherine Feste is one of my favorite inspirational authors. 



 Special features of 365 DAILY MEDITATIONS include: 



 * One meditation for every day of the year, to help you to
reflect on what really matters in your life. 



 * Inspirational quotes from famous people, as well as quotes from
the Bible, the Koran, Buddha and Rumi to help you find
understanding, inner strength and spiritual peace with your life in
order to better cope with your illness. 



 * Practical diabetes tips, and healthy ways of coping with stress
and strong emotions. 



 * A guide to your inner resources and strengths, i.e., being able
to see yourself as a hero, not as a victim 



 This is a book you can use as a practical guide to help you 
move beyond day to day obstacles, and gain a deeper understanding of
your life and the challenges living with diabetes presents. I&apos;ve
long believed that the mind and body are inseparable in coping with
a chronic disease. 



 The introduction to 365 DAILY MEDITATIONS is written by Rachel
Naomi Remen, MD (another favorite author on my bookshelf), 
bestselling author of KITCHEN TABLE WISDOM and MY GRANDFATHER&apos;S
BLESSINGS. Dr. Remen succinctly sums up the whole of this book in
stating, &quot;Through illness, people may come to know themselves for
the first time, to recognize not only who they really are, but what
really matters. Illness shuffles the hierarchy of our values like
a deck of cards. Often a value that has been on the bottom of the
deck for years turns out to be the top card. In illness, people
abandon values they have never questioned before, and uncover ways
of living far more genuine and unique. Often these ways are also
more soul-infused.&quot; Dr. Remen further states, &quot;In all the years I
have listened to people with cancer, no one has ever said to me that
if they died, they would miss their Mercedes, even though such a car
and all that it represents has been the focus of their lives for
many years. This shift may represent a kind of healing.&quot; 



 365 DAILY MEDITATIONS, by Catherine Feste, is a wonderful book
which will help you find your way whether you are newly diagnosed or
have many years of experience with diabetes. I highly recommended
this book as a must-have for anyone searching for inner strength to
cope with a chronic disease. 



 An estimated 17 million Americans already have type 2 diabetes
and another estimated 16 million Americans have what is now called
&quot;prediabetes.&quot; In THE COMPLETE DIABETES PREVENTION PLAN, A Guide to
Understanding the Emerging Epidemic of Prediabetes and Halting Its
Progression to Diabetes (Avery/Penguin Group USA), two of the
country&apos;s leading authorities on nutrition and diabetes -- Sandra
Woodruff, MS, RD, author of several books on healthy cooking (all
of which are already on my personal bookshelf), and Christopher
Saudek, MD, director of the Johns Hopkins Diabetes Center and former
president of the American Diabetes Association -- have combined
their expertise to present a total life plan addressing the emerging
epidemic of prediabetes. 



 Full of information on preventing or even reversing the
development of diabetes by a total nutrition, exercise, and
lifestyle program, THE COMPLETE DIABETES PREVENTION PLAN contains a
checklist of diabetes risk factors, thoughts on drugs versus diet
and lifestyle changes, strategies for weight-loss success, foods
that help fight diabetes (and belong in your pantry), eating out,
and the power of physical activity (the big-E word). Completing the
package, THE COMPLETE DIABETES PREVENTION PLAN features 150 easy and
appealing recipes that emphasize good carbs, healthful fats, and
controlled calories -- all crucial elements in a diabetes-fighting
meal plan. 

 

 THE COMPLETE DIABETES PREVENTION PLAN gets two thumbs-up for
its simplicity of language, completeness of subject matter, ample
recipe and meal-planning sections and easy-to-read format. This book
is well worth your investment and highly recommended. 



 Last November, the American Diabetes Association focused on the
link between diabetes and heart disease for American Diabetes Month. 
People with diabetes are at high risk for heart attack or stroke,
and their heart attacks tend to be more serious, and can happen
early in life. In fact, two out of three people with diabetes die
from heart disease or stroke. Both women and men are at risk. 



 CHARTING A COURSE TO WELLNESS, by Treena and Graham Kerr (the
former &quot;Galloping Gourmet&quot;), have teamed up to share their inspiring
journey of partnership in love, food, and life with the story of 
Treena&apos;s stroke, heart attack and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. With
a focus on using food to make you well, the Kerrs have learned it
helps tremendously to have a partner for getting well. 



 From my perspective, one of the best sections of CHARTING A
COURSE TO WELLNESS is found in the chapter titled The Nine Stages of
Change, which the authors have broken down as follows: Stage One:
Aware Yet Disinterested; Stage Two: Relative Impact; Stage Three:
Concern Leads to Enquiry; Stage Four: Denial; Stage Five:
Acceptance; Stage Six: Possibility of Success; Stage Seven:
Engagement; Stage Eight: All Things Can Work Together for Good; and
Stage Nine: Taking Action. The Kerrs have devoted over 20 pages in
the book to this formula for success. 



 CHARTING A COURSE TO WELLNESS also provides you with more than
430 ways to learn how to eat right, in recipes for breakfast,
brunch, main dishes, side dishes, desserts and sauces. Each recipe
is low in fat and carbs, and is accompanied by a complete
nutritional analysis, and diabetic exchanges. In addition, the book
introduces The Food Preference Sheet, a really innovative food
inventory tool you can use to design your food choices according to
Tastes, Aromas, Color, Textures and Ambience (in serving style).
There are also other food choice considerations, such as Appearance,
Preparation, and Cultural Styles of Cooking, i.e., French, Italian,
Mexican, North African, Caribbean, Mediterranean, etc. Change isn&apos;t
so hard when you like the way it tastes, and, in this book, there&apos;s
a plethora of creative and innovative ways of looking at food
preparation, from kitchen to table, to keep your mouth satisfied and
your body on track. 



 In summarizing the content of this book, Graham and Treena Kerr
say it best: &quot;Food can make you sick, and food can make you well. 
Getting well is a challenge, and it helps tremendously to have a
partner. We have learned there is no better gift you can give to
yourself, to each other, and to your family. With the epidemic of
obesity and diseases caused by poor diet in our country, all of us
are learning (or re-learning) the value of coming home, cooking
dinner, and gathering around the table together.&quot; 



 Reviewer&apos;s Footnote: Having reviewed and published many food
articles from the American Institute for Cancer Research, I was
extremely pleased to see the number of recipes in this book
recommending foods healthy in phytochemicals and antioxidants,
natural cancer-fighting properties. CHARTING A COURSE TO WELLNESS
(published by the American Diabetes Association) is well worth your
time and investment, and gets a super-star rating. 



 That&apos;s a wrap for this issue, folks. Stay focused and in the
moment because your future is now!

 DIABETES: 

 WHERE WE ARE TODAY, WHERE WE WILL BE TOMORROW 

 by Frank Vinicor, MD, MPH, and Jinan Saadine, MD 



 From the Editor: Dr. Frank Vinicor is the director of the
Division of Diabetes Translation, part of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. He and his colleague,
ophthalmologist Dr. Jinan Saadine, addressed the annual meeting of
the Diabetes Action Network, held in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 1,
2004, at the annual convention of the National Federation of the
Blind. Then the doctors took questions from the audience. The
first part of the presentation appeared last issue, VOICE Volume 19,
No. 4, October 2004. Here is the conclusion: 



 Q: I have been having neuropathy problems in my hands and feet. 
Is there anything I can do about that? It is irritating and itchy. 



 A: Neuropathy is a very common problem for people with diabetes. 
It is generally viewed as the most common complication, and it can
be severe. For some people, if the bedsheet touches their feet, it
just sends them through the wall. There are a lot of treatments and
medicines, which tells you we really don&apos;t know what to do about it. 
If you go in the bookstore, and go to the nutrition/diet section,
and you see there are 375 books on nutrition and diet control, that
should tell you at least one thing: &quot;we don&apos;t know how to do it.&quot; 
If you go up there, and you see maybe one or two, and they all say
the same thing, that means we&apos;ve learned something. It&apos;s like that
with treatment of neuropathy. There is a list of five, six, maybe
seven different medicines available. Its trial and error. Try one;
see if it works; if it doesn&apos;t, then try another. One of them is an
anti-seizure medicine; one is a medicine for anxiety. There are
different kinds; try them. Usually you can find one that works, for
you. But it is not easy, and it is not quick. 



 Q: For people who have diabetes complications, what is the outlook
for improvement? 



 A: It depends on the complications, what they are, and how long
you&apos;ve had them. How far advanced are they? If one of the
complications, for example, is sudden hypoglycemia, and you are
unprepared for it -- people&apos;s quality of life is getting better. 
The stability of their blood sugar is now dramatically better. If
you are talking about eye problems, and the problems are already far
advanced, they really don&apos;t get better. If it&apos;s not so far
advanced, yes, it can be improved. The same with nerve and kidney
problems. Advanced, established &quot;opathies&quot; are unlikely to get
better, but they probably won&apos;t get worse. That&apos;s where we are now,
but these are relatively small, and recent, studies, done in the
last two or three years. We sure have a lot to learn. 



 Q: What is brittle diabetes? How is one identified as a &quot;brittle&quot;
diabetic? 



 A: Everyone with diabetes is not brittle. People who, in spite of
their best efforts (and those of their doctors), have wide,
unanticipated swings and unexplained falls in their blood sugar,
such as they would have side effects: seizures or whatever, and you
can&apos;t figure out why it happens - they are described as &quot;brittle.&quot; 
You try different insulins, different diets, and different
activities, and the problem continues. That is generally what is
meant by &quot;brittle diabetes.&quot; In general, the term is most applied
to certain people with longstanding type 1 diabetes. 

 

 The Edmonton Protocol has specific inclusion criteria they use,
for defining a diabetic as &quot;brittle.&quot; You can imagine after this
study came out in the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE on seven
patients, their phones were ringing off the wall. Everybody with
type 1 diabetes understandably wanted to volunteer for
islet-transplant studies. They set up a protocol, and they still
get literally 20,000-30,000 calls a month. And they have a very
well-defined protocol (I don&apos;t have the specifics with me) where
they review the specific conditions that have to be met before they
will enroll people in studies. It still is not available for
regular clinical care but just for these expanded islet cell
studies. 



 No congestive heart failure and no coronary artery disease are
two of the criteria. Why? A lot of studies look at people with
heart problems and diabetes, but when you do studies in general, you
want some assurance the people who enroll in the study will be
around for a while to see whether the intervention works. Now they
are. It use to be if you had diabetes you couldn&apos;t get into any
studies, heart or otherwise - and you couldn&apos;t get a kidney
transplant either. 



 Q: I have an under-active thyroid problem. Is there a
relationship between thyroid problems and diabetes? 



 A: For some kinds of diabetes, the autoimmune attack can do damage
to the thyroid and cause it to be under-active. I don&apos;t know if
that is your case. Hypothyroid treatment is very simple - we used
to love to find people who needed it. It&apos;s a pill, it works well,
and people feel better. In internal medicine, it is rare to find a
condition for which you can help people feel better with a single
pill. Once your thyroid condition is treated, if you have
pre-diabetes (they&apos;re separate conditions), as long as your
condition stays pre-diabetes, you are not at heightened risk for eye
disease or kidney disease. 



 Q: I am losing my sight from toxoplasmosis. Is there any chance
I can volunteer for the CDC retinal cell transplant studies?. 



 A: At this stage there isn&apos;t any retinal cell transplant that is
working, but in the future you&apos;ll have to wait for that. Your
condition is one in a million. At the CDC they look at bigger
problems more common in the population. Yours is so rare. They do
a lot of studies, in a lot of areas. 



 Q: Could you explain what is autonomic neuropathy? 



 A: In general there are two types of nerves in the body. There
are the kind of nerves that go to your feet or hands, and make sure
you aware if things are too hot or too cold. And there is a set of
nerves called the autonomic nerves. For example, we probably aren&apos;t
thinking about breathing right now, and we&apos;re not thinking about my
heart beating regularly, and after supper tonight, I&apos;m not thinking
about my stomach and intestines digesting food after dinner. All
that stuff is controlled by autonomic nerves - automatic. They sort
of just carry on and do what they are supposed to do. Sometimes,
with longer standing diabetes, it is not only the nerves in the
hands and feet, but also the autonomic nerves can also be effected. 
It can be a real challenge. If those nerves are affected, it can
cause dizziness when you stand up, you can&apos;t digest your food as
well as you would want to, and your stomach can get large ... 
That is part of what is called autonomic neuropathy. Pathy means
&quot;damage.&quot; Sometimes people with diabetes get it. It&apos;s not as
common as peripheral nerve problem. But It can be a real pain if
you have it. 



 Q: I have been told certain vitamins build up the immune system. 
It this true? Which are the good ones to build up immune system. 
Are there any? 



 A: There was a study that finished about one year ago, and it
looked at vitamins and antioxidants for macular degeneration. They
had a protocol of specific amounts of zinc, antioxidant and vitamins
to be in the pill. The study was done with people who already had
macular degeneration, the intermediate stage of macular
degeneration. And it proved to help in stopping or delaying macular
degeneration. The formula that study used is a little bit on the
expensive side. You can&apos;t just go to the drug store and get it over
the counter. There is one combination of these vitamins, and it
helps for macular degeneration. It will help slow the progression
of the disease. 



 Q: I heard something about an extract from spinach to help the
retina? 



 A: I don&apos;t know anything about this spinach extract ... I think
all of us take different things, and that&apos;s OK. The most important
thing is that you tell your doctor what you&apos;re taking. It&apos;s better
they know. But to date there are no studies, in fact there are some
negative studies, where people with diabetes who were right on the
cusp of developing heart disease or the like were given combinations
of vitamins, but they didn&apos;t seem to help prevent heart problems. 
We still have a ways to go to understand if and what kind of
vitamins might be helpful in terms of diabetes. 



 Q: What can you tell me about insulin resistance and sleep apnea,
and would you conclude that in diabetics with sleep apnea this is a
neuropathy related to the diabetes? 



 A: This whole things about diabetes and sleep apnea (apnea means
you don&apos;t get a good night&apos;s sleep). There is a breathing
difficulty - you wake up repeatedly, after building up carbon
dioxide in your blood, then fall back to sleep. During the day,
because you haven&apos;t had a good night&apos;s sleep, you&apos;re tired all the
time. That relationship with diabetes has been described now for
maybe two or three years. The studies suggest there is a
relationship. 



 Being overweight alone has been related to sleep apnea. Being
overweight, having weight difficulties, is also associated with type
2 diabetes. As far as I know, it hasn&apos;t been possible to tell
whether or not this sleep apnea - diabetes connection is related to
just weight, or whether, as you&apos;re suggesting, it might be related
to autonomic neuropathy of the lungs, which is a possibility. But
I don&apos;t know which it is; I don&apos;t think anyone knows which it is --
and it is being actively studied. 

 

 There is a condition called central (as opposed to peripheral)
apnea. It is very severe, and can require an individual be placed
on a ventilator. It is infrequent, not very common at all,
thankfully, and has little association with diabetes. I am not a
neurologist, but I believe its causes may be specific, targeted
strokes or other brain injury, or perhaps congenital/genetic
conditions. It is peripheral apnea that correlates with diabetes,
with weight situations, and with the autonomic nerves. The damage
is not in the brain stem, but in the nerves after they have left,
such as the nerves that enervate the diaphragm - that tell your
diaphragm every 20 seconds to contract - to breathe. You don&apos;t
think about it - it just happens. That is the much more common one
and the one that is being related to diabetes. The association has
been noted, but the cause of it, I don&apos;t know what it is in terms of
diabetes. 



 Q: Are you familiar with the claims of the companies marketing
what they call &quot;Glyco-nutrients?&quot; These people also claim milk is
the number one cause of diabetes. 



 A: I don&apos;t know about the first part, these &quot;eight essential
sugars,&quot; I don&apos;t know one way or the other. I would ask all to be
cautious with these proclamations. All of us are looking for easy
answers, and, unfortunately, for diseases like diabetes, I just
don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s not good or not true, I just don&apos;t
know. 



 Let me talk about the milk issue. For type 1 diabetes, there
were some studies which suggested if youngsters were exposed to
cow&apos;s milk when they were receiving feedings, there was a protein
part of the cow&apos;s milk that had an identical structure to a
particular protein in the insulin-producing cell. And the body,
once it saw the cow&apos;s milk protein, said &quot;that&apos;s not mine&quot; and would
produce these white blood cells to destroy this milk protein, then
say: &quot;Wait a minute, that protein is in my insulin-producing cells;
I&apos;m going to destroy those cells, too.&quot; Maybe ten years ago there
were these &quot;observational studies&quot; exploring whether early exposure
to milk protein could be a factor in setting off type 1 diabetes. 

 There have been subsequent studies - and these have not shown
such an association. Right now, in Finland, there is a study 
(Finland has the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes) where an
entire community is exposed to cows&apos; milk, and another community to
mothers milk, and the researchers will look to see whether or not
this milk association has a role to play in explaining type 1
diabetes. But, there is no consensus about that, in the more recent
studies. They don&apos;t show the relationship some earlier studies did. 



 Q: I&apos;ve heard that babies who were heavy milk drinkers were more
likely to get type 1? 



 A: You can look at different studies and get different things. 
Again, in general the initial studies looking at cow&apos;s milk
suggested an association, but the later studies have not been able
to confirm that. So now there is this important study from Finland,
which will look at it prospectively, not retrospectively, so we
will know. These studies take a while - but we will have an answer. 



 Q. If you receive a diagnosis of diabetes, but you get your
numbers under control, are you still considered to be diabetic? 

 

 A: From 1979 to 1997, there was a category of diabetes called
&quot;previous diagnosis of diabetes.&quot; It got confusing, so in 1997 the
American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization
re-did the diagnosis and classification of diabetes, and they
removed that category. So, in general, I think all of us now are
comfortable saying if you legitimately have the diagnosis of
diabetes, it does not go away. If you stay under good control,
fantastic, that&apos;s great, but you still have the diagnosis of
diabetes. 



 Q: Is there anything specific for eye care people with diabetes
can do to prevent vision loss? 



 A: For diabetics, good control is the most important thing. You
have to control your blood sugar. High blood pressure and
cholesterol are also risk factors. These can make it worse. There
isn&apos;t anything like a pill you can take for eye care. Eye
complications are part of the diabetes, and the best thing you can
do for them is to take care of blood pressure, cholesterol, and
blood sugar. Also, it is recommended you see your eye care
specialist once a year. If you are not a high risk person, meaning
you have no background retinopathy, you can go two to three years,
as it takes that long to develop any aneurysm or retinopathy. But
it is recommended you go once a year to the ophthalmologist, and not
just to look for retinopathy. Look for everything: macular
degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, refractive errors, visual acuity,
glasses, etc. And get some regular exercise, ideally walking, 30
minutes five days a week. More would be better, this is a minimum. 



 Q: Once you are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, how often
should you see your retinal specialist? 



 A: If you are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, you should go
every year. If you are diagnosed with advanced diabetic
retinopathy, or are at high risk for it to become proliferative,
then you might be advised to see your ophthalmologist much more
often. 

 

 Q: I note every doctor is going to say &quot;early intervention, the
sooner the better.&quot; If they see symptoms that may become serious,
they send the patient on to a specialist. Why is it that when a
doctor sees someone who maybe at risk for vision loss or eye
problems, they don&apos;t refer them to a blindness specialist until all
hope is lost, and they&apos;ve exhausted everything they have? How do we
start them to think of early prevention, so we don&apos;t get to
blindness? I&apos;m talking about the fear some doctors have of telling
a patient they might become blind, or that they ought to think about
learning alternative (non-sighted) ways of doing things; that they
might have to change their lifestyle. Some say they won&apos;t talk to
you until you are already legally blind. 



 (Editor&apos;s Note: This question, and the next, were answered by Dr.
Saadine) 



 A: That is why I said earlier, really now more work is being done
on not just the clinical definition of visual loss - but on the
functional. What is 20/200, or 20/40?. It&apos;s what is the impact on
the quality of life -- not just what is the number of visually
impaired? And, as I mentioned earlier, we should have plans for the
disease and any loss of vision, and we must refer people to
low-vision specialists who can help to make the most of the limited
vision 



 Q: When I started losing my sight, they strung me along, didn&apos;t
say what might happen, and couldn&apos;t tell me where to go or what to
do. They sent me to all kinds of specialists for medical things,
but made me try to reinvent the wheel, and all they had to say was
suggest to me: &quot;Why don&apos;t you try and go talk to some blindness
people?&quot; It can&apos;t hurt to be prepared, to learn Braille even if you
never need it. It might save your job, or your future. 



 A: Too many medical people, the last thing they want to do is use
the word &quot;blind,&quot; because they feel they&apos;ve failed. Blindness to an
ophthalmologist is what death is to a general practitioner. There
is a new attitude in the rehab field, as they have been authorized
to look at functional models rather than sickness models of
disabilities. 



 Blindness is not the end of things. There are so many things
you can do with people who are blind. But ophthalmologists don&apos;t
have expectations of a person becoming blind. You&apos;re asking for
prevention before happening. Like learning Braille before becoming
blind. They don&apos;t expect blindness unless it is going to happen. 



 Q: But some people will fall into predictive models where they may
be 70 percent likely ...? 



 A: I think this is a generic problem for a lot of our health care
system. Most of us in the past were trained a certain way. The
health care system is set up for repair, not for prevention. That
is the nature of the health care system. Medicare, for example,
will pay the $40,000 to $50,000 to safely and effectively complete
an amputation, but won&apos;t pay the 15 cents for the little
monofilament to tell if a person has an insensitive foot, so they
know to get special shoes. That isn&apos;t Medicare&apos;s fault; they follow
what the law said in 1965 and on. There is an absolute disconnect
between chronic conditions in which finding it early and preventing
its progression is the thrust of chronic diseases -- versus a
healthcare system and training that has gone on and is now training,
but training that was just saying: repair, repair, repair. Who
doesn&apos;t want to be repaired? But it takes away from finding things
early and doing something about it. 



 One quick comment: this maybe a shock to you, but doctors
aren&apos;t uniquely smart (they&apos;re not uniquely stupid either); you will
find some not so good ones and fantastic ones and most of the ones
in the middle. It&apos;s coming out of a system that was put in place in
the 1940s, for repair, and set up for repair, and reimbursement, and
education. And we are dealing with a very different system here, of
need. 



 Q: Last time you spoke to us, you stated many people have diabetes
for ten years before being diagnosed. Is that still valid? 



 The statement in the study suggested that for someone with type
2 diabetes, they probably had it for five to ten years at a low
level. Now, depending on how you define type 1, if you define it as
having this autoimmune process (normal blood sugar, but autoimmune
going on destroying cells), they have had it for ten years or more. 
That is why we are trying to move to find diabetes early, back to
this entity called &quot;pre-diabetes.&quot; We now know, with type 1
diabetes, if you have certain genetic structure and have evidence in
blood stream the Beta cells are being destroyed, you maybe can stop
it there, before blood sugar even starts going up. But as I
indicated, the earlier studies didn&apos;t show we could do that. 
They&apos;re trying other studies now. 



 Q: Many of us who have diabetes have put on more weight since we
became diabetic. I feel it is because I have to eat more
frequently. My doctors and nurses say I have to eat three meals a
day, to keep my diabetes under control -- and my body will not
digest three meals a day. I didn&apos;t used to eat that much. 



 A: Most people, when first diagnosed, have amazing amounts of
calories coming out in their urine. Remember when we used to test
urine for sugar? That was calories we couldn&apos;t digest. You ate it,
couldn&apos;t digest it, and peed it out into the toilet. When you first
get diagnosed, and treated, and your blood sugar comes down, all
that stuff we got rid of, that went down the toilet, now stays in
your body, for energy. So almost everybody, when they first get
treated, gains weight, over the first three or four days. You
retain water, and you drive the sugar you used to pee out into the
cells. Then, beyond that, some of the medicines we still use today
cause us to gain weight. For example, insulin is a growth-promoting
hormone. One of its consequences is your body gets the signal it
should eat. There are some tablets people take which also give that
same signal to eat. There are other tablets now out that don&apos;t give
us that signal. I&apos;m not saying one is better or worse; they work in
different ways. 



 For example, people who take metformin (glucophage) generally
don&apos;t gain weight. They keep it the same. It may be in part
because the medication tends to cause you to be a little bit sick to
your stomach. But -- you don&apos;t gain weight. 



 It&apos;s a hard balance, but what you&apos;re experiencing is in fact,
very common. The way it&apos;s best approached is not to stop the
frequency of eating, but to perhaps decrease the amount you would
eat at each meal, and, if possible, increase how much you burn up,
by increasing your activity. The old idea, that you would have
regular mealtimes, I think that&apos;s still good; but the amount you
have at each meal, and the amount you could burn up, if you were a
little more active, that&apos;s the way we deal with the tendency to gain
weight. What you&apos;re experiencing is not rare at all; it is a common
story. 



 Q: What about the combination of diabetic drugs? 



 A: Let me tell you in general the way we&apos;re going, and for people
who don&apos;t like to take a lot of pills, boy, the diabetes community
is in trouble. It used to be we recommended one injection of
insulin a day. Or, we recommended one pill. Nowadays, just for
blood sugar alone, it&apos;s much more common; most people are
recommending combinations. You could take two or three tablets, and
each of them work in a different way. You might take insulin, if
you&apos;re not on the pump, two different types, twice a day. The
&quot;combination approach&quot; to controlling blood sugar is now in vogue. 

 This approach is also now used with blood pressure. Almost all
of us [doctors] now assume if you have diabetes, you have high blood
pressure. You&apos;re going to need at least two blood pressure
medicines. We&apos;ll tell you to take your aspirin. It&apos;s
&quot;poly-pharmacy&quot; in 2004 for people with diabetes. The reason is we
know from good studies, if we can get the blood pressure, blood
sugar, and cholesterol down, you don&apos;t have to have the problems. 
The tradeoff is, taking lots of medicines (and that&apos;s a real pain,
taking lots of medicines); but the benefit is you keep your feet and
your eyes and your kidneys and your heart. It&apos;s a real challenge. 
You&apos;re going to see more and more of that, taking a lot of medicine. 

 I have enjoyed being at your seminar again this year. Thank
you again for having us.

 New Gastroparesis Treatment 



 Gastroparesis is interuption of parastalsis, the normal travel
of food dthrough the digestive system. It is one result of
autonomic neuropathy, nerve damage to the functional systems of the
body -- and, for diabetics, it can be extremely serious. 
Interfering with the regularity of digestion, gastroparesis can make
blood glucose control next to impossible. 



 There have been few treatments. DIABETES CARE magazine
(27:2341-47, 2004), a leading, peer-reviewed, professional medical
journal, reports a new one, from an unlikely source. 



 Botulism is an often fatal form of food poisoning, but botulism
toxin has been used (as Botox) by plastic surgeons, to remove
wrinkles. It is a paralyzing agent, and researchers wondered if,
injected into the pylorus, the sphincter valve at the base of the
stomach (a frequent site of the spasms that can characterize
gastroparesis), Botox might offer relief. 

 

 Eight patients with type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis
volunteered for the study -- and experienced general relief of
symptoms. 



 Researchers immediately called for larger studies of the
procedure, to determine its long-term safety and efficacy. NOTE: 
It will be some time before these studies are completed.

literature collection, with free materials on many subjects,
including diabetes, available in a variety of formats. The diabetes
articles are available, in large print or on 4-track audiocassette,
in a single volume titled: DIABETES ACTION NETWORK ARTICLES, or
singly, in large print. These are free of charge. 



 The Materials Center also has a supply, in Braille and on 4-track audiocassette, of the new ADA EXCHANGE LIST FOR MEAL PLANNING,
2003 Edition. In Braille, price is $10; on tape, $2.

 New Diabetes Resource List 



 The Diabetes Action Network of the National Federation of the
Blind now offers the 2004-2005 edition of DIABETES RESOURCES: 
EQUIPMENT, SERVICES AND INFORMATION, our comprehensive list of
resources for diabetics. Diabetes Resources is our compilation of
companies and individuals offering products and/or information to
help diabetics, especially those who are blind or are losing vision,
self-manage their diabetes. The list contains many subject
categories, including: Insulin Measurement Devices, Insulin Syringe
Magnifiers, Insulin Injection Systems, Diabetic Foot Care, Blood
Glucose Monitoring Systems, Insulin Pumps, Products for the Blind,
Food and Diet, Literature and Information, Distributors of Diabetes
Equipment and Supplies, and Medication Assistance. 



 Blind diabetics can and do accurately draw up insulin, monitor
blood glucose, and perform the other tasks of independent
self-management. By using alternative techniques and products, they
can continue being independent, and control their diabetes as
efficiently as do their sighted peers. Limitations are usually
self-imposed -- often, all that is needed to overcome negative
thinking is simply to know where to go for information. 



 DIABETES RESOURCES: EQUIPMENT, SERVICES, AND INFORMATION
(2004-2005 edition) costs $5 per copy, and is available in Braille,
large print, and 4-track audiocassette, or you can access it on the
NFB website: (www.nfb.org/diabres) 



 Please order from: National Federation of the Blind, Materials
Center, 1800 Johnson Street, Baltimore, MD 21230; telephone: (410)

 The 2005 National Federation of the Blind Scholarship Program 



 This year&apos;s scholarship program, for blind students planning
higher education, will be the 22nd since the organization determined
to expand the number, variety, and value of the scholarships
presented at the NFB annual convention every July. The Federation
plans to present at least three of the scholarships to students who
won scholarship awards in a previous competition. All current
students who were scholarship winners in previous years should take
particular note of this program and consider applying for the 2005
National Federation of the Blind scholarships. 



 Full-time employees interested in pursuing post-secondary
degrees should take a close look at the scholarship form, because
one award may be given to a part-time student holding down a
full-time job. 



 Order scholarship forms from: Materials Center, National
Federation of the Blind, 1800 Johnson Street, Baltimore, MD 21230,
or from NFB State presidents. The 2005 scholarship application form
is now downloadable from the NFB website:

 New Hypoglycemia Alarm 



 Diabetes brings with it the risk of hypoglycemia, low blood
sugar. Some of us need some help. What many of us need is an
alarm, a device to warn us we&apos;re going low, when we cannot tell for
ourselves. There is now such a device -- FDA approved. 



 Diabetes Sentry Products, from Bellingham, Washington, offers
the Sleep Sentry, a wrist watch-sized device that sounds an audible
warning whenever the wearer&apos;s blood sugar drops too low. Not a
blood glucose monitor, this noninvasive device meters changes in
body temperature and sweat consistent with hypoglycemia, and sounds
a warning in time for you to take action. Completely noninvasive
and continuous, the Sleep Sentry costs $399, shipping included, and
may be ordered from: Diabetes Sentry Products Inc., 1200 Dupont
St., Suite #1D, Bellingham, WA 98225; telephone: 1-866-270-5675;
website: www.sleepsentry.com 



 Input Needed 



 Diabetes Educator Ann Williams, who writes a column for the
VOICE each issue, wants to do one on &quot;diabetes definitions,&quot; all
those $64 words the doctors &quot;use to confuse.&quot; Do you have a
favorite(!) diabetes term or two you&apos;d like to see defined in plain
English? Send it in, to: Ann Williams, c/o VOICE OF THE DIABETIC,
1412 I-70 Drive SW, Suite C, Columbia, MO 65203; or at e-mail:
(ebryant@socket.net) 



 VOICE Formats 



 VOICE OF THE DIABETIC is offered in two formats: standard
print, and 15/16 ips audiocassette, &quot;talking book&quot; speed. Anyone
who is currently receiving the VOICE in print and having difficulty
reading it, may receive it on cassette at no charge. Voice tapes
REQUIRE the special tape player available free to the legally blind
from Regional Libraries for the Blind and Physically Handicapped,
which can be obtained by telephoning the National Library Service
at: 1-800-424-8567. Note: Attempting to play Voice tapes (or any
other tapes recorded for the Blind in NLS format) on a conventional
music-speed tape player will fail, yielding only incomprehensible
&quot;chipmunk sounds.&quot; 



 The VOICE is also available, free, by e-mail, distributed
quarterly. Go to: (www.nfbcal.org/listserv-signup.html) to sign up. 

 Periodically we receive requests for the VOICE in Braille or
large print. It is not available in either of those formats, at
this time. 



 All a subscriber needs to do, to switch from standard print to
tape, or to receive both formats, free of charge, is contact us at
the VOICE OF THE DIABETIC Editorial Office. 



 Articles Needed 



 If you have diabetes, are a family member or friend of a
diabetic, or a health professional with an interest in diabetes, we
invite you to submit an article for publication in the VOICE OF THE
DIABETIC. 



 Our philosophy regarding diabetes is positive. Do you have an
inspiring, enlightening story? We, the Diabetes Action Network of
the National Federation of the Blind, seek to show people they are
not alone, and do have options, regardless of diabetic
complications. If you have experienced ramifications, others, who
may be facing the same side-effects, could benefit from what you
have to say. 



 Perhaps you have not experienced complications--your unique
insight, coping strategies, and lifestyle can still inspire others. 
Are you a relative, a friend, or a health professional? More than
339,025 VOICE readers could benefit from your story. 



 For information and article submission guidelines, contact:
VOICE OF THE DIABETIC, 1412 I-70 Drive SW, Suite C, Columbia, MO
65203; telephone: (573) 875-8911.
