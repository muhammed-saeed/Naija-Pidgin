 Weight Loss Lunch Ideas 
 Sep 14, 2010 | By Victoria Weinblatt Photo Credit vegetables image by cherie from Fotolia.com 
Eat a healthy, low-calorie lunch to promote weight loss. Skipping meals or eating small portions that leave you still feeling hungry causes you to overeat at your next meal, according to FamilyDoctor.org. To lose 1 lb. of fat weekly, you need to eat 500 fewer calories a day, or 3,500 fewer calories a week. Use lunch ideas that will satiate your hunger without hindering your weight loss plan.
 
Protein

Eat a protein-rich lunch for weight loss. High-protein diets are the most effective diets for stimulating hormones that make you feel full, according to a small-scale study conducted by the Department of Human Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. The results, published in the June 2008 issue of the medical journal &quot;Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism,&quot; found protein from peas and wheat are the most potent stimulators of certain satiety hormones and more potent than codfish. Eat a bowl of pea soup for lunch. Pair your soup with a sandwich containing all-natural lean deli meat, low-fat cheese and whole wheat bread. Vegetarians and vegans can eat baked tofu on their sandwich.
 
Fast-Food Lunch

Order a takeout lunch at a fast food restaurant and stick to your calorie-restricted diet with menu selections suggested by &quot;Fitness&quot; magazine. At least one international fast-food chain offers a veggie burger, which you should order without condiments. Use such condiments as ketchup and mustard, which are lower in calories and fat than mayonnaise. Get a large order of chili for protein without all the carbs and order a side salad with light dressing. If you&apos;re don&apos;t eat red meat, order a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of green beans and a small order of fries. Certain fast food restaurants offer a salad bar. When dressing your salad, steer clear of full-fat creamy dressings and pasta or vegetable salads that contain mayonnaise.
 
Salad-to-Go

Low-energy-density foods, such as vegetables, let you eat large portions without consuming a lot of calories. Make yourself a vegetable salad for lunch. Include 3 cups of your favorite greens, one hard-boiled egg or half a cup of cubed tofu,½cup of sliced veggies and a small amount of cubed cheese. Prepare a salad dressing from olive oil, fresh lemon juice, ground white pepper and a sprinkle of your favorite herbs. Eat your salad-to-go with two rice cakes smeared with almond butter or tahini.
