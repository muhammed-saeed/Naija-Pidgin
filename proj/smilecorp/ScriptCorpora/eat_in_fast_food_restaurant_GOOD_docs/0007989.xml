 Nutrition Information for Wendy&apos;s 
 Jun 14, 2011 | By Melanie Greenwood Photo Credit Jupiterimages/Goodshoot/Getty Images 
People in the United States eat out between four and five times a week, according to Registered Dietician Katie Bogue. Bogue recommends that people who have health concerns, but who also frequent fast-food restaurants, to make an effort to choose restaurants that offer healthful options. Wendy&apos;s is one such fast-food restaurant. Knowing what to order, and what to avoid, can help you stay on track.
 
Salads

Health-conscious customers tend to gravitate toward salads, but if you want some greens, be careful which salad you pick. The BLT Cobb Salad contains 670 calories and 47 g of fat, but only 3 g of fiber. The Mayo Clinic recommends keeping your total fat intake between 44 g and 78 g of fat per day, depending on your needs. That means if you&apos;re on the lower end of the spectrum, this one salad contains more fat than you should eat in an entire day. Instead, try the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad. Though this salad contains 580 calories, it has 27 g of fat, half the fat of the BLT Cobb Salad. Plus, this salad contains twice the fiber of the BLT Cobb.
 
Burgers

If you&apos;re hankering for a burger, stick with single burgers, and hold the fat-based condiments. For example, the Wendy&apos;s quarter-pound single contains 470 calories and 21 g of fat. Leave off the mayonnaise, and the count drops to 430 calories and a manageable 18 g of fat. Contrast this with the Bacon Deluxe Triple, which contains a diet-busting 1,150 calories and 73 g of fat, more fat than most people should eat in an entire day, according to the Mayo Clinic&apos;s nutritional guidelines.
 
Sides

Burgers and fries just go together, but there are other options if you want to keep your fat consumption in check. For example, a garden salad with Pomegranate Vinaigrette Dressing contains 80 calories and 2 g of fat, while a small order of fries contains 330 calories and 15 g of fat, and a large order of fries contains 540 calories and 25 g of fat. If you do decide to get fries, consider splitting them with a friend, and eating your half one at a time so they seem to last longer.
 
Beverages

When choosing what to drink with your meal, chose water instead of a soft drink. A sugar-sweetened medium cola adds 200 calories, but no nutrients, to your meal. Also, according to Dr. Benjamin Caballero, senior author of a study conducted by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and quoted in a recent Eurekalert, reduction in liquid calorie intake might play a more significant role in weight loss than reduction in solid calorie intake. If water just isn&apos;t for you, consider getting low-fat milk, which gives you calcium and 8 g of protein.
 
Wendy&apos;s Recommended Items

Wendy&apos;s has several menu items that the company recommends for those watching their waistlines. These include Ultimate Chicken Grill, no sauce, with a side salad and fat-free dressing. This option contains a diet-friendly 390 calories, 4 g of fat, and provides 3 g fiber. Another recommended option is the Grilled Chicken Go Wrap, no sauce. This is another good option, with 200 calories and 4 g of fat.
