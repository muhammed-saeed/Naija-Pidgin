Tips On How To Cut Your Monthly Expenditures

 By Joseph Kenny 
 
Money can certainly be tight for many of us, and most of us could use a few tips on how to cut down our monthly bills. While not all tips will ever work for anyone, a number of these can be used by most - that means that there should be something here you can use. Here are a few ideas on how to cut down on your monthly expenses.

1. Combine Your Credit Cards

Most credit cards have a rather high interest rate on them - at least anything is high if it is greater than 0% APR interest. Many credit card offers will now give you 0% APR interest rates for balance transfers and give you great savings each month. All credit card offers are not equal, though, so you should do a little comparison shopping in order to get a good one. If you cannot get a credit card with this level of interest, then try to get one for as low a level as you can get. Also, watch out for balance transfer fees.

2. Comparison Shop

Rather than doing impulse buying, you will usually save a considerable amount of money by looking around for those better deals. This may mean it takes a little more time to shop, but it will help your bottom dollar line. By saving money on good deals, however, should mean that you may have a little more money at the end of each month to either put into savings, or, pay a little extra on those bills to reduce your debt. Much comparison shopping, as you know, can be done on the Internet - and save you some gas money, too.

3. Reduce Your Bills

While this may sound like it is so easy, it may not be for some. Some ways, however, that many can begin to save even more money is by cutting back their thermostat one or two degrees. That little bit can really add up over a year. Another way may be to take that new car and trade it in for a good used one - one that might get a little better gas mileage, too. Other bills that could be reduced may be your Internet service providers (which can be obtained for as little as $6.95), cable TV, and maybe even your car insurance could give you more savings if you increase your deductible.

4. Eat At Home More

Another great expense in many homes is the frequency of eating out. It obviously costs more to eat at a fast food restaurant than it does at home. Besides, it is healthier to eat a balanced home cooked meal than you will ever get at any fast food chain. Another thing that will help is if you plan your menus, and don&apos;t go food shopping when you are hungry. By eating at home more often, it could be possible to save as much as $20 to $30 each week - something that you could put into savings, or use to help reduce your debt in other areas. And another thing, eating at home more could give everyone a little more family time, too.

5. Know Where Your Money Is Going

Most homes have no real idea of where every penny goes. If you keep track of every penny for about two or three weeks, you will know. But as you look over the things you spend money on each week, you may conclude that a lot of money was spent on things that you could have done without. Knowledge, someone said, is power, and knowing where your money is actually going will help you make some wise corrections.

As you become more conscious about where your money is going, and start to make more informed choices about your expenditures, you will soon find other ways to save even more. It all starts with making yourself conscious of where it is going, and knowing what do you want and need to do with it.
