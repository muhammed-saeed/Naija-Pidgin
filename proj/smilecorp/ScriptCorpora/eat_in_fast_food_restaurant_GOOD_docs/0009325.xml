Permits Needed to Open a Restaurant


 : If you want to open a restaurant, there are some things that you should comply with in order to operate a legitimate business. You will need the following - business license, food handlers permit, liquor license, sign permit, music license, and fire certificates. 

Visit the concerned offices in your area today, pay the fees, and submit the paperwork.

 

Different Permits Needed for Opening a Restaurant

Running a restaurant business is no joke. You should be aware that you need a lot of licenses and permits to keep things legal. These requirements usually vary from one country to another. In some countries, business registration is a necessity. You will have to register for the initial year of operation and for the succeeding years, you will have to renew annually. In some places, registration is no longer needed especially when the business is not incorporated or if you’re not using a fictitious name for the business.

Visit the local city or county clerk. There you can find the needed information about permits and licenses. Aside from these things, you will need to check the sign regulations and zoning ordinances in order to comply accordingly. If the business is US-based, you will need to secure an EIN or Employer Identification Number with the IRS. This is identification that you are a business owner. Here are some of the things you need to secure–business license, food handler’s permit, liquor license, sign permit, music license, and fire certificates.

Business License, Food Handlers, Etc

Almost all countries require a business license. Depending on your location, the government might oblige you to pay a certain percentage of the yearly gross sales or pay a certain fee for the business operation. You can consult with the city clerk for this license. Consult with the health inspectors in your area about the Food Handler’s Permit. This is important to make sure that you will be selling edible goods. This will also make your restaurant more attractive and a safe choice for people. Do you have plans of selling liquor in the restaurant? If you do, you will need to apply for a liquor license. The license will be based on the alcohol beverages that you’re planning to sell. This is renewable every year.

To put up signs outside the establishment, you will need a sign permit. Check the restrictions with location, size, and sign to avoid problems. Most restaurants these days provide music to entertain customers. This is vital for those with a Karaoke, DJs, or bands. Get a license or you can be penalized. The fire department should inspect the premises to check if you have fire exits and comply with other requirements. To get this, you will need to secure a permit from the police, seller’s permit, and zoning. You should be reminded that laws and regulations usually vary from place to place. With the right knowledge, you can run a legit business.
