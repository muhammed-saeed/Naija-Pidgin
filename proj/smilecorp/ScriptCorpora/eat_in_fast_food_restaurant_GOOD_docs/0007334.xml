Do yourself a favor and check the archives on this one, Bud. I&apos;m too worn out from the last 1,000 post Wiggy thread...

You&apos;ll find lovers and haters here. Seriously, you&apos;re not looking for the kind of can-o-worms that a question like this opens...

 Quick and simple.
5 lbs is heavy for a 0 degree bag that won&apos;t keep me warm on 20 degree nights.

I don&apos;t seem to have any problem staying warm in my 3 lbs +15 bag on 20 degree nights. Posted by: map

 A sleeping bag is a lot like a boot. There are a lot of variables and it&apos;s often a matter of &quot;fit.&quot; I have no interest in Wiggy&apos;s for a couple of reasons. One, I have found sleep systems that work for me so I&apos;ll stay with companies like Integral Designs or Big Agnes. Two, I&apos;m allergic to drama. 

Wiggy wars are legendary on some backpacking and hunting gear forums. The founder of Wiggy&apos;s, Jerry Wigutow, is has a sort of scorched earth approach to marketing and to interacting with the folks on the &apos;net. So do some of his ardent supporters. Asking for opinions on Wiggy&apos;s, I&apos;m guessing that you&apos;ll get more heat than light.

My suggestion is go to place where you can try on a wide range of bags. Take a close look at the fit and finish; the stiching, the zippers, the seams. I like a roomy bag. I&apos;m a warm, restless side sleeper with really big (14) feet. Personally, I think you can toss out temperature ratings. I lean towards overbags and liners to extend the rating of a bag, sort of the layer approach. The great thing is that there&apos;s never been more great gear out there than right now. There are some good manufacturers and a lot of options. Posted by: VernAK

 Hampstead has it right.....very well said....

I live near the US Army CRTC [cold regions test center] and I frequently ask those folks for their opinions.....regarding Wiggy Bags they told me the bags were OK but the attached verbal
BS was simply too much. Posted by: IDMilton 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/14/08 10:38 PM 
 My size regular O bag weighs 4 2. It has held up well. I like that I can wash it at home and that it has a good warranty. I bought it several years ago after using a friend&apos;s extra Wiggys on a Sitka November goat hunt. (It rained/snowed six of the seven days.) I liked his enough to buy my own and and would buy another. WIth that said, I haven&apos;t owned any of the other contenders, so can&apos;t compare them. I have slept in WM bags and loved the warmth, weight, and obvious quality, but I don&apos;t want to hassle with washing them in the bath tub, I am afraid I would get them wet, and they cost more. Posted by: Hampstead 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 04:51 AM 
 Thanks, Vern, for the kind words. The truth about Wiggy&apos;s is somewhere between the extremes. A Wiggy&apos;s bag won&apos;t kill you in your sleep nor will it get up and make you breakfast after a perfect night&apos;s sleep. There&apos;s nothing in a brand name that will keep you warm at night or make a bag fit you. And remember, a sleeping bag is a consumable item. You can stretch the use over years depending on how much you sleep in the bag, but any fabric, any insulation breaks down over time, period. It&apos;s important to sleep well in the bush. Make sure the bag fits and give a thought to a system that allows you to peel down. Being too hot is just as comfortable as being too cold. Posted by: rost495 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 05:07 AM 
 I don&apos;t like all the BS either, but we have 5 of the bags in the family. Use the zero bag at base camp all the time to the 20s so far. VERY warm. I won&apos;t hesitate to use them. The overbag rating is maybe a bit hopeful by 5 degrees or so.

That said, I&apos;m after a light compact down bags for our bivy forays... the w bag is too bulky for that.

 I recently ordered a Wiggys 0 degree bag from Marc and can only tell you what I have been told by friends that use em, cuz this is my first. I know some pretty hard core Alaskan hunters that do several treacharous adventures a year and they put all their faith in the Wiggys bags (or I wouldn&apos;t be trying one!), no if ands or buts. I am sure there are lots of bags that work (including the ones I have used) out there I just figured I&apos;d try a new one. Its not gonna be my backpacking bag but for some of the wet late fall stuff when the temps dip a bit more, and rain can be expected each day with frost at night. FWIW... I will say that this was my first time speaking with Marc and he seemed like a real good guy, thats for the guys on the forum that dont like him, or misinterpret his personality. Posted by: CCH 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 07:54 AM 
 As Marc recommended, search. You will find all that you want and more, both the good and the bad. I don&apos;t normally play the &quot;search&quot; card, but if ever a question warranted it, this does. Posted by: AkMtnHntr 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 08:21 AM 
 As most already know, I own a Wiggy&apos;s bag and I use it for all my hunts, backpacking, float hunting, 4 wheeler camping, and so on. I don&apos;t let what Jerry Wigetow says affect my decision making when it comes to sleeping bags and I don&apos;t want to be part of any of that drama. There are many, many bags out there that will work for you and Wiggy&apos;s is one of them. If your looking for a lightweight backpacking synthetic bag then you might consider the Glacier hunter, it weighs in at about 3.5 lbs and is only sold up here in Alaska. There&apos;s a wealth of info you can get from this forum, use the search function and you&apos;ll realize what you&apos;ve been missing. Posted by: Miner

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 09:38 AM 
 I&apos;ll back up what Cub says, I bought a bag from Marc a few years back.

He was very helpful on the phone in helping me make a decision as to which bag I wanted. Sent the bag right out. good service.

haven&apos;t met him in person, but he comes across imo&amp;e;alot better over the phone than he has at times over internet forums.

course if I&apos;d just opened up a store and had a product &quot;I&quot; believed in and that had served me and others well and found out folks disparaging it up and down, my reaction might not be favorable to some or many either.

I absolutely detest the guy that puts his name on the bag however, but heck I buy Patagonia gear too if it suits me.

that&apos;s enough of the bullchit, that really doesn&apos;t have much to do with a guy looking for a bag.

I&apos;ve got a Wiggy&apos;s bag, it&apos;s not my favorite for bping or just general use, but one of the features touted by the manufacturer is durability when left compressed.

So it mainly rides in my boat and is there if needed.

I kind of use the gun rule #1 rule, bring a gun.

If I have to spend a night out due to mechanical or navigational defect I&apos;ve got a sleep bag with me, it may not be my favorite, but it works pretty well in a wet environment and it can stay compressed so I can throw it in the boat at the beginning of the summer and not worry about it.

Plus it was inexpensive enough not to worry about theft or damage to it.

ime&amp;o;(experience is pretty vast, but hey so are my opinions)
it ain&apos;t the be all, end all in a sleep bag

but it ain&apos;t a worthless pos either,

it&apos;s got it&apos;s place, for me that&apos;s in my boat, I could see Super Cub users having one stuffed in the back for that matter.

that others use it and enjoy it in wider applications surprises me none

that many of the guys I know to be experienced bp&apos;ers have found better alternatives for them is no surprise either.

whether it will be &quot;the&quot; bag for the original poster asking is up to him to determine.

we all have our own quirks, boots that many like are not suitable for others of us that put mileage on shanks mare.


you can get valuable learning curve shortening by asking folks of their experience. but if you&apos;re ever going to perform at &quot;your&quot; best. you have to find what works for you, that there be differences on just what that gear is be it bags, boots or calibers should not surprise anyone.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 10:51 AM 
 A synthetic bag by any top drawer gear maker is probably going to be a pretty decent bag. Western Mountaineering is good. Integral Designs is good. Big Agnes is good. Marmot is good. MontGell is good. Here are a few more tips. Try on a bag. Lie down. Work the zipper. Close your eyes and work the zipper. Toss around. Get tangled up. Work the zipper. I can&apos;t stand a bag with a lousy zipper, and lousy is just a matter of fit. Some bags just don&apos;t have a zipper I can work well. Others do.

Fit and finish is important in a bag. Look at stitching. Look at seams. Tug, pull, twist... get a sense for how the bag is constructed.

Oh, and work the zipper.... it&apos;s the only moving part except the sleeper. Posted by: map 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 05:23 PM 
 Ok, this is the deal. where I live there is no place to go look,
try on, or buy a decent bag. All the people around here say goto
wal-mart. So I&apos;am just asking for some simple advice and suggestions on what brand and style would be the best for hunting
in cold damp area&apos;s I know I need 0- and I would like the mummy
style. So please help.
thanks

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 05:41 PM 
 How much do you want to spend and what exactly are you going to use it for? Ratings are not exact and vary from manufacturer to manufacturer so you&apos;ll have to take a chance there or find out as much as you can on a given bag on forums such as this. As to fit, dimensions are easily available for most bags. With a couple of safety pins and a sheet you can get an appoximation of girth and length to see if the bag will be your cup of tea. Not exact by any means but it&apos;s a start. If you&apos;re fairly stout and don&apos;t like being confined, you will be able to eliminate a whole bunch of mummy bags right off the bat. Wiggy&apos;s come in a variety of sizes and can be ordered roomy if you decide on one of those. If you have to order a bag, REI and Campmor are also good places to check out. The latter can be particularly good if you&apos;re on a budget. I think more info will help people better point you in the right direction. Posted by: Shag

 I&apos;am going to Alaska this year and they (the guide) said I need
a 0- bag and could not be down. My buget would be 200-400 on a bag and sleep pad. Now I have already purchased a thermarest pro lite 4. Now I would like to have a quality bag for other uses.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/15/08 11:17 PM 
 good lead Mike,

am sure he&apos;ll appreciate it.


I don&apos;t have a 0 degree bag, closest I have is an old Kelty rated to 5 degrees.


for what you&apos;re looking for I&apos;d take a hard look at the TNF snowshoe, pard had one when we went to Kodiak, seemed like a good bag to me.

I&apos;ve used the Cat&apos;s Meow extensively (20 degree) and have been very pleased with the service from mine. Posted by: Miner 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 01:31 AM 
  Originally Posted By: CCH If you have to order a bag, REI and Campmor are also good places to check out. 

REI has a no questions asked return policy. If you purchase there and it doesn&apos;t live up to the temperature ratings, at least you can return it and you won&apos;t be left &quot;holding the bag&quot; . Of course at that point it might have made the hunt pretty miserable.

I have a Big Agnes Lost Ranger and I love it. I need a little more girth and I get it with this bag and I don&apos;t find myself lying next to my pad in the middle of the night. I always stay on it. The Lost Ranger is down (but I live in a desert) and rated to 20 degrees so it does not meet your criteria, but they do have a line of synthetic bags you might want to check out.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 07:11 AM 
 I have bags from sierra designs, TNF, wiggy&apos;s, big agnes.....and many more. all have been pretty good to me. the zipper on my TNF puked after 6-8 trips. most of my bags have similar zippers.....the wiggy&apos;s is HUGE campared to the others. I am impressed most by the &quot;guarentee&quot; of wiggy&apos;s. I have not used it yet. I did not try to return my TNF bag as I bought it through campmor and I had it over a year, but still was pretty bummed.

all in all, if it is wet, or could be wet, and I do not have to haul my bag on my back too far I look to my wiggy&apos;s. if I am hiking/b-packing I use a lighter, more fragile bag and try to keep that in mind.

good product....yes, BEST product......depends on application. Posted by: Hampstead 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 08:36 AM 
 REI is a good lead particularly with the guarantee. All the bag manufacturers have a web site with dimensions. Have your wife or someone get out a sewing tape measure. Get a measurement in inches around the widest part of your body, normally your chest around the outside of the arms. Measure the hips with your arms hanging loosely. You probably already know your height. Now, what you&apos;re going to see is all the good bag makers will give you measurement at the shoulders and hip girth. Some guys (like me) just can&apos;t get comfortable in a snug bag. I toss and turn too much and I don&apos;t like feeling constricted. Your preferences (and size) may vary. What I like about my Big Agnes is that I stay on the integrated pad. Flopping around like I do, I always end up off my pad. The BA is down. For a synthetic, I&apos;d suggest Integral Designs. The Emporer is a zero degree bag and you have some choices of fit. Of course, the American dollar is pretty soft right now so you will feel a little pinch ordering out of Canada... but we have to support our neighbors to the north. Posted by: 1akhunter 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 09:09 AM 
 high country, I believe if it was me, I&apos;d have returned my bag anyway or called TNF themselves.

should be a YYK zipper I&apos;m thinking, mine have given me years of trouble free service, sorry you got a bum one.


and mark me down as one that firmly believes in putting gear through it&apos;s paces before it ever heads into the field where I&apos;m placing chips on it, be it bags, boots, stoves, or firearms.

yeah sleeping in my own yard in winter/spring looks pretty dumb, that&apos;s why I have a house that the neighbors can&apos;t see! Posted by: MarcTaylor 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 01:46 PM 
 
Widest part of your body is at the elbows when laying flat on your back. That is where I would take a measurement from.

Camping manager at REI in Anchorage says he doesn&apos;t sell that many sleeping bags anymore... Hmmmm...

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 03:17 PM 
 FWIW, I have 2 Wiggy&apos;s bags that I bought for hunting in Alaska. A 0 degree bag (superlight) and a 20 degree bag (it was a Kifaru/Wiggy&apos;s but the name has changed). I bought them after looking and researching many syntethic mountain bags. If I went with a down bag is would be a Western Mountaineering bag, however, you need synthetic for Alaska (trust me). I bought my nephew and brother-in-law each a 0 degree bag for our upcoming moose hunt. The bags have a lifetime guarantee and a lot of Alaskans use them. Those were the 2 biggest selling factors for me.

While Wiggy&apos;s personality maybe be a bit of a rub, I&apos;ve had nothing but good dealings and customer service with Marc Taylor. BTW, my cousin is an assistant guide in Alaska and he bought a Wiggy&apos;s bag from Marc too. Posted by: ironbender 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 04:35 PM 
 Another REI plus, if you have one nearby, is their data sheet. They have them for pretty much each gear type - sleeping bags, tents, stoves, water purifiers, you get the picture. That&apos;s a good way to start the search, IMO, in that you have a list of all the particulars of each offering (&apos;course it&apos;s just what REI sells, but it&apos;s generally a pretty good selection) on one page to compare measurements, shell, insulation type andamount, price, etc.

ETA: They may have it on their website as well, haven&apos;t looked though. Posted by: CCH 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/16/08 04:46 PM 
 Why don&apos;t you try one of these and let us know how it works? It&apos;s listed at about a pound less than the 0 degree Wiggy&apos;s (reg/wide) I had weighed.

Does anyone know that Wiggy&apos;s is laminating insulation for certain Slumberjack Sleeping Bags?

I had the opportunity to go to dinner with Climashield at the O.R. show in Salt Lake last month. There are ALOT of changes coming to the sleeping bag industry...

 I&apos;m not going to go into tons of detail, or get into a tussle about what someone else sleeps in, anymore.

I&apos;m just going to add to this thread as far as synthetics go.

I just spent the weekend working with a lot of the Kifaru Climashield equipment.
God knows, I&apos;ve been highly skeptical of this stuff and have said so all along.

Frankly, it blows the doors off the W-stuff. The shell material is actually advanced, the cut is par excellance, the draft collars, cordage, zippers, and overall fit&amp;finish are what has been lacking in a myriad of offerings. We had guys in 0 degree bags doing flawlessly at -10. I had worn climashield material with a 40 degree fill-rating and and was impervious to -10, also.

Weight-wise, they are on par with the Micropuff pieces. Honestly, I&apos;m sold. Hands down, I&apos;ll have a standard base bag and a set of the clothes this year. I&apos;ve criticized them for lots of designs and lots of aspects that I didn&apos;t like. The way they are approaching the use of this insuation is dead-nuts useful to hikers and hunters.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/18/08 03:14 PM 
 Wow, that Wiggy guy sounds just like old Jack Stephenson. I&apos;d love to listen to them debate about why their bag is the best on earth and you would die in any other bag. I am a sleeping bag slut, I have owned the following over the years: * are bags I still own and use.

Down bags
1967 Eddie Bauer Heavy Duty rect. bag*
1968 Holubar Timberline *
1969 Stephenson Warmlite
1970 Sierra Design 100 Superlight
1970 Sierra Design 200
1972 Alpine Designs tapered rect.
1973 Kelty*
1974 Sierra Designs Mountain Machine* bag&amp;liner
1974 Camp Seven rectangular bag

Synthetic insulation:
1992 Slumberjack heavy duty rect. bag
1998 Cabbella&apos;s rect. bag.

I worked for Kelty Pack from 1970-1974 and got to buy everything at cost plus 10%, plus I was their designer and got to keep some prototypes. I lived and camped in Alaska from 1974-78 including a 66 day trip down the Yukon River, I used nothing but light weight down bags and never had an issue with the insulation getting soaked, but I was carefull to keep it dry.

 To be honest, the guys that hunt in SE Alaska are a much harder test on keeping gear dry. Now I live in Montana, I still hunt, fish and backpack, and have the occasional rainy day, but I don&apos;t live in continuous rain like those SE AK guys.

There were six of us in three canoes on that Yukon River trip. We put in at Whitehorse in mid June and paddled to Alikinik near Nome, then lucked out and got a ride on the last barge going back upriver. We were dropped off near Nenana on August 24, 1974. Most of the trip was dry except the last 2 1/2 - 3 weeks as we apprached the Bearing sea in late August. We kept our gear in waterproof stuff sacks and duffles, that was before dry bags. We had two North Face experimental four man expedition tents, slept three men in each tent. The section from Whitehorse to Tanana was great, after that is was cold, wet and boring as we paddeled against the wind and chop through hundreds of miles of flat land.

This was a couple years before they built the Yukon River bridge so it was very wild and quite an adventure. I remember we ran into a 68 year old guy, I think his name was Charlie Wolf, near Tanana, he had paddeled the river every year for thirty years! Posted by: kutenay

 Interesting, before I even knew about the inherent dangers of down in wet climates, I learned how to keep my sleeping bag(s) dry and did many trips in very wet conditions using down bags. My wife was outpost nursing out of Whitehorse in those days and I was a young punk who spent over 150 nights in the bush per year for well over a decade, almost all in down.

IF, I HAD to pick ONE and ONLY ONE bag from the 17 that I have owned and used in the past 44 years, it would be, without question, a down and WPB membrane bag. My latest acquisition, a Valandre Shocking Blue in a fabric shell that is maybe the finest sleeping bag material I have ever seen, as this whole bag seems to be, would rate VERY high on my list of choices and I would use an ID eVent overbag with it.

 Valandre...
This that the bag you special ordered from England, Kute??

Sounds pretty darn nice.

And speaking of nice, how are you liking that new Hilleberg Soulo?? Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/18/08 04:57 PM 
 No, the bag from &quot;perfidious Albion&quot; will be a Peter Hutchison Designs Xero 1000 bag as the Valandre came to me from a good friend and is in the temp. range of the PHD bag I was about to order, the Xero 800.

The Valandre bags are made in France and they ARE something pretty special, no question. I love the Soulo, it is the tent I have wanted all my life and I highly recommend it for solo camping in the winter....you don&apos;t need this bombproof and costly a rig for summer. Posted by: Glacier_John 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/18/08 05:09 PM 
 Have you guys looked into the Stephenson Warmlite bags? They are now being made by Jack&apos;s son, they are very expensive but very good. Jack Stephenson went agaist the whole grain of mountaineering conventional wisdom when he switched over to a vapor proof fabric thirty years ago. The only reason I sold my Warmlite was beacause it only had a half zip so I couldn&apos;t vent it in warmer weather. That plus I was always looking for the next best thing, I wish I still had that Warmlite, I&apos;d send it back to the factory for a zipper change.

Warning, the Stephenson catalog is based on their nudist lifestyle, (sound of many feet rushing to their site). I was in Jack&apos;s house a few times back in the seventys; with his wife and daughters present it was hard to concentrate on their gear. Posted by: stillhunter73

 I got a catalogue from him in 1971 and the ladies certainly WERE a &quot;distraction&quot;..... I kinda LIKE those semi-hippy type babes, well, not their politics, but, other salient points, shall we say....... 

I decided then that his bags were not for me, but, I am sure that many like them very much and the catalogue sure didn&apos;&apos;t HURT his marketing strategy..... Posted by: stillhunter73

 They really weren&apos;t hippys, just nudist and excentric ones at that. Jack is one of those geniuses that is certain he is right and everybody who has a different point of view is an idiot. He could be very-very difficult to deal with, and that catalog turned away way more customers than it attracted, but for the most part his gear is fantasic. I just can&apos;t afford it. If I win the lottery I will order a Warmlite sleeping bag and 3R tent. Posted by: stillhunter73

 I&apos;ve got one of the Wiggy&apos;s Kifaru special&apos;s...now known as the Mnt. Hunters. I&apos;ve had pretty good luck with mine. It&apos;s a bit on the heavy side compared to some other synthetics these days and also could use a draft collar, but otherwise it&apos;s a good bag. So far no loft issues with mine that others have reported with their bags.

Ah, I get ya.
Thanks for the reply, Kutenay.

I am thinking about a Hilleberg Akto for various uses, but I am going to wait a bit on the purchase, methinks.

 Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/18/08 08:10 PM 
 I have dealt with vigilguy since 2005 and, IIRC, I told Chawn about him; we have become good friends and he calls me often to get my opinion on gear he is considering for his business and to share his thoughts on stuff he sees at shows and tests.

I will simply say that VG is, in every respect, a gentleman and as decent and honest as you could hope for, PLUS, he actually USES the gear as not many sales types do, at least here in Vancouver.

So, yeah, get Hilleberg stuff from him and he does ID and several other good brands as well. He is going into Rab gear and they have some Endurance-down bags that would be suitable for hunting and are evidently of high quality.

PHD is a largely custom maker who produces gear for Antartic-Arctic and Himalayan use, my interest is in getting a winter bag that fits me EXACTLY as I prefer and it takes some years of experience to determine this. So, I will probably get one in due course as I am getting back to doing a lot of winter camping, something I always really enjoyed whenever work left me time to do it.

PHD currently has a sale on their down parkas and they have just an awesome reputation among serious mountaineers, something to consider if you like down parkas. Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/18/08 08:41 PM 
 Kute turned me on to VG for sure.

VG is the straightest shooter I&apos;ve ever dealt with. The man has actually talked me out of gear that I was aching to buy; since my current rig was so close. This has occurred more than once.

I can&apos;t see how this gent can be faulted, and everyone ought to give him a shout when they are considering gear choices. He&apos;s absolutely content to discuss such without any &quot;push&quot; to buy. The man just likes to learn. Posted by: 1akhunter

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 06:20 AM 
 Map,

As with many gear discussions, we have a dollar&apos;s worth of talking over five cents difference. I can&apos;t speak from personal experience on Wiggy&apos;s because I have never bought a Wiggy&apos;s bag. The overall &quot;book&quot; on them, as far as I can tell, is that they make a competent synthetic bag that is a bit on the heavy side. There are a half dozen to a dozen other manufacturers mentioned on this thread that make equal (or aruably better) sleeping bags.

Now, the simple fact of the matter is that you have better odds of winning the lottery than in being in a situation where the PHD Zeta 2 or an ID Emporer would have saved your life while the Wiggy&apos;s Mountain Hunter let you die. (The converse comparison is also true any promotional claims by Wiggy&apos;s notwithstanding).

Once you get to competent makers of gear, this is mostly personal preference. In the twigs, a guy learns to love gear that saves his bacon and hates gear that lets him down. This passion spills into discussions like this, even when it is not entirely rational. I still laugh thinking about a bivvy I had with my brothers. One of the boys had a new bag with the name &quot;Everest&quot; in it. He was colder than a smelt all night. The next morning, I made a show of looking at the tag and said, &quot;I&apos;ll be damned. I didn&apos;t know there was town called &quot;Everest&quot; in the Bahamas.&quot; He threw the bag in a dumpster, mostly because I convinced burning the thing would probably release some toxic fumes... and the scent of papayas. 

So, don&apos;t take all this fussin&apos; about gear too seriously. You have enough good recommendations here to make a fine choice and at the end of the day, you&apos;re the one in your bag, not anyone else here (or so I most fervently hope). Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 06:43 AM 
 I disagree, there ARE very significant differences in gear made by different makers and some items are far better suited to certain uses/users than others. I take my gear VERY seriously, but, I often go out alone and depend on it to keep me safe from serious difficulty if I get lost or injured.

While choice among the FEW really highend gear makers is often a matter of personal preference, much of the info. posted here is relevant to choosing what works best for you and that I have to say is very valuable. I have obtained a LOT of info. here that has helped me greatly in gear choices and am sure that I am not alone in this.

Deciding between a down or synthetic bag is a major concern for some and deciding on model/maker is also important as many cannot afford to try out gear until they find what&apos;s best for them. So, the palaver here has a lot of value for most guys and I respect those that honestly post their opinions based on their experiences. That&apos;s my story and I AM sticking to it! Posted by: Hampstead 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 07:42 AM 
 When my brothers get excited about what I think of as &quot;trivial&quot; differences in $400 sleeping bags or $1400 rifles, I give them two names... Lewis and Clark. Lewis and Clark humped across 4000 miles of the same country we hunt without the benefit of goose down or synthetic sleeping bags. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a Canadian equivalent like the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company, Kute. 

I take my gear seriously, Kute, but I also realize that we are living in the lap of luxury compared to folks even 25 years ago. I think discussions like synethic versus down are always valuable, particularly for a greenhorn who hasn&apos;t spent much time trying to bivvy in horizontal rain. I think tips on picking gear help make sure a guy buys something that fits. Talking out loud is a good way to sort things out... but I will respectfully disagree with the &quot;very significant differences.&quot; You line up a dozen synthetic sleepings bags made by &quot;name&quot; makers with a list price of between $300 and $500 U.S. Tear off the labels and 99 percent of the guys who backpack hunt (as opposed to climb K2), couldn&apos;t tell the difference between them in the store or in the twigs. And every darn one is better than anything we had when I was a pup.

There&apos;a a great little movie my kids love, &quot;The 13th Warrior.&quot; One of the lines is, &quot;Luck often enough will save a man if his courage hold.&quot; This is how I feel about gear... gear will save you often enough if your woodscraft holds. Sure, gear is nice and it can make the difference, but every piece of gear can fail. Woodscraft is a skillset and knowledge that exists as long as you are conscious. There are guys who will spend more time looking at catalogs and making a decision on sleeping bags than practicing how to start a fire in poor conditions. Men love gear because, in our hearts, we are all still boys. We covet those shiny new things, those red bicycles with chrome wheels, those bone handled pocket knifes or Winchester lever-action .22s with the John Wayne loop or whatever.

What makes a difference in the twigs is not something in your pocket or your pocket. It is what is in your chest and between your ears. Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 08:22 AM 
 The woodscraft aspect goes without saying, my point was simply that these differences in gear DO exist and DO strongly influence how a person&apos;s trips happen, whether they are enjoyable or even safe.

I don&apos;t see a parallel here with early explorers as we cannot act as they did, killing numerous animals and leaving the rotting meat that we cannot consume quickly. I think that very few people now grow up as I did, with oldtime BC bushmen to start them off learning bushskills. I could and did build perfectly functional &quot;quinzees&quot;, igloos, leantos, a frames and even stone shelters in the dense BC forests surrounding our house by the time I was finishing elementary school, as did a number of my friends.

However, this type of skill WILL NOT help you survive alone on a five day solo trip when you break your ankle the first afternoon and nobody expects you back for the remainder of that week. A suitable bivy-tarp-bag combo WILL keep you alive under these circumstances and others where traditional woodcraft may be beyond your capabilities and this is WHY using cutting edge gear CAN and DOES increase your ability to go beyond in truely wild country.

I wouldn&apos;t own anything with John Wayne on it, most HBC gear is fuggen crap and I was in the NWT over 40 years ago, USING their stuff and I snicker at most of the lowend junk that allows people to get wet, cold and even die from hypothermia. I realize that you are being a bit of a &quot;devil&apos;s advocate&quot;here, but, I am thinking that you may be a closet &quot;Luddite&quot;as well!? Well, better than that &quot;other&quot; closet, eh? Oops, you and I are getting too politically incorrect, my bad!

I agree on guts and brains and said just this on the weight thread, but, if you come to my house in Vancouver, I will SHOW you the real differences between several very highend sleeping bags as well as WHY I consider ID synthetic bags to be the best. I will also show you the VERY major differences between top end backpacks and WHY I prefer some to others.

Then, we can go over to the North Shore and build a fire in the rain and waste a lot of calories gathering wet wood, done it many times for practice and now tend to depend on my bivies for more efficient shelter/warmth in bad weather. Then, there is the alpine where there is no fuel for fires, plus deep snow travel where fires are very difficult to maintain and so forth.

Yup, I think that SOME serious gear research, in catalogues, here on this forum and in shops is really worthwhile, so, I again tend to disagree....but, I am kinda an ornery old baztard, anyway! Posted by: AkMtnHntr

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 08:32 AM 
 Brad,

I&apos;ve had an interesting and varied life but those four-five years working at Kelty Pack was the best job I ever had, and that includes 16 years as a charter boat captain in Hawaii!

I started working in the Kelty store in Glendale California while I was going to college in Spring 1969. In the back of the store they had the old original industrial sewing machine that Nena Kelty sewed the original pack bags with. One day a guy returned a destroyed Gerry Yearounder rental tent that he set on fire with a candle lantern. They were just going to throw it away so I asked if I could try to fix it for myself. Rich Kelty, Dick&apos;s son showed me how to use that tempermental old machine and I learned how to sew nylon. After that when someone wnted to add a back pocket, ice axe loop or some other minor repair to a pack bag, I would just do it there in the store rather than send it off to the factory.

Sometime in 1970 I was called into the office and was told that the factory wanted to expand their R&amp;D;department and reccommended that I interview for the job. Kelty R&amp;D;at that time consisted of one guy, Jim Lawrence a aerospace engineer, but Dick Kelty, now resigned from day to day business, had an adjoining office. I interviewed with both Dick and Jim and got the job. I was hired more as an assistant who could help make patterns and sew up prototypes, plus I was to test the prototypes, great job!

As luck would have it, Jim was taking a two week vacation starting my second day, so I was just supposed to sew up one day pack from a pile of parts Jim gave me, while he was gone. Well, the first day he was gone Dick Holmgren our head of marketing charged ito the office asking for Jim; after months of negotiating with REI we had just got their first private lable back pack and we had to have a prototype to them within the week. This was a cool challenge and with occasional input from Dick Kelty, I was able to design and produce a cool prototype that was very distinct from the regular kelty Pack and easier to manufacture. we sent it off to them, they sent it back with some changes, we made the changes and sent the new one off. It was approved for production with colors to be worked out all in the two week time Jim was gone on vacation. this included a new pack frame and susspension belt that no Kelty had at that time.

Needless to say my responsibilities grew after that. Over the next four years I was part of the two man team that designed over forty products that went into production and countless others that didn&apos;t. Some of my memorable ones are the original Kelty Tioga and Serac. To my knowledge I was the first to design a large capasity interal frame pack. There had beensome smaller rucksacks, like the Alp Sport Eiger pack that had aluminum stays in it, but the Kelty Tour pack was the forst pack that combined a load supporting intregal hip belt with internal stays and enough capasity to carry a winter overnight load. I got to test that pack on a nine day trans High Sierra shi tour trip in March 1972. We basically skiied from Mammoth Mountain ski resort to Yosemite Valley, following what in summer would be the John Muir trail.

My years at Kely ended when I got the bug to go to Alaska and do that Yukon River trip in the summer of 74. I want to say that Dick Kelty was the finest person I have ever met. An absolute genius, very witty and most of all very compassionet to others. I had the pleasure of keeping in touch with him over the years until he passed away in 2004. He even joined me on a trip where I delivered a 150&apos; cruise boat from Connecticut to Hawaii in 1989. He and Rich joined the boat in Jacksonville FL and stayed with us, taking their share of watches all the way through the Panama Canal and up the West Coast to San Diego.

Sorry for the long post, I could write a book about this stuff.

 There is an example of what I am trying to convey in my last couple of posts, I never knew that Kelty had the first IF large pack, I always thought that it was others who did this and I find this really interesting. Kelty packs were VERY scarce in BC in those long-ago days and I used Camptrails, Fjallraven and Karrimore packs while others also used Millet packs and a few Trailwise externals until Lowe came out with their internals and MEC began importing them and Hine-Snowbridge plus Wilderness Experience...ah, the good old days of being able to go for 12-14 hrs. a day and not even be tired, youth REALLY IS wasted...etc.!

I am shocked, shocked, I say! 

I don&apos;t want to quibble, particularly when this may be the first civil Wiggy&apos;s thread in written history. I concede that there are differences between the products offered by high end gear makers. In my experience, I worry most about the shelter, moreso than the pack or the sleeping bag or some of the other gear. I also think it&apos;s the item where there is the greatest variation. My point is simply that once you have made the commitment to buy top drawer gear by a reputable manufacturer that fits, you&apos;ve done about 90 percent on the gear front. You are the kind of guy who wants/needs the extra 10 percent. Most guys will never come close to needing that last 10 percent, me included. This is not to say I don&apos;t spend obscene amounts of money on gear (according to my lovely wife). I&apos;m old and lazy enough to want to enjoy the bounty of the twigs in the greatest degree of relative comfort. I&apos;ve been cold and wet enough to last the rest of my life. Besides, what would the kids do with all that money anyway? Posted by: Brad 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/19/08 05:07 PM 
 Dang, great post John. No need to be &quot;sorry!&quot;

I&apos;m a bit younger than you obviously and didn&apos;t get the backpack bug til 1974/1975. The Tioga was the 30-06 of backpacks by that time... they were everywhere!

The one Kelty pack I always had a yen for was the Serac. Wonderful to actually get to yak with the guy that designed it!

Though I used a few Kelty&apos;s that were friends, I carried Jansport packs until I went to internals in 1978, though I still have an old FL sized Trailwise ala Colin Fletcher.

Not surprised to hear of Dick Kelty&apos;s character... it shown through in every picture I&apos;ve ever seen of the man.

As a kid, I was captivated by the article in National Geographic from the late 60&apos;s/early 70&apos;s of the yound guys that rafted down the Yukon and wintered in a cabin they built... after that I always wanted to raft the Yukon... glad to actually meet someone that did 

A sailor too... go figure. I suppose you know Robin Lee Graham (ala Dove)lives up in the Flathead? Know him?

Was captivated by his account as a kid too!

Keep writing man (grin)...

 I have a Valandre Shocking Blue that will go to -20*F and weighs about 2 oz. over 3 lbs. My Integral Designs Himalayan weighs 4.5 lbs. and will do -35F and probably colder, based on previous experience with down bags.

My Wiggy&apos;s and my Integral Designs weighed about the same and the ID was better at below freezing, so, I gave my Wiggy&apos;s to my nephew. There are better options for a 0* bag in terms of weight, IMHO. BUT, some guys like Wiggy&apos;s and trying one to see how YOU like it is a good plan, call Marc Taylor who as you see here has a solid rep among his customers and see what happens.

 Superlight will work just fine for you but like everyone else said, if your not satisfied with it return it and get your money back. I have an Ultra Light (20 degree) and wouldn&apos;t hesistate to use it at zero degree&apos;s and it&apos;s a little lighter than the Super. Keep in mind that they are guaranteed for life too.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/21/08 11:44 AM 
 Well I returned from my vacation in Mexico late last night and low and behold my new Wiggy&apos;s Superlight (0 degree bag) was at home waiting for me. I took it out of the box and the compression sack and layed it out. Marc convinced me to go with a Reg wide size and I am glad he did. The bag is plenty big enough for a guy to turn around easily in and even lay belly down with your arms in front of you elbows out. Its toasty enough to not be able to lay in it very long in the house. I&apos;ll be putting it to the test this spring so we&apos;ll see. I cant imagine it not working well, though it is no lightweight by backpacking standards, but I wasn&apos;t seeking the lightest bag made for its intended use. Bag appears to be very well made, quality zippers and stitching for sure. For the coin I&apos;d say a guy cant go wrong. Marc packed it real well and he even through in the Wiggys pillow so many bitch about!...grin

Kudos Marc and thanks! Posted by: ironbender

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/21/08 02:56 PM 
 map,
Your bag won&apos;t be weighing 4# because of your height/weight. I can honestly fit very few men in the REG/REG size bags because most men have broader shoulders than that size will support.
You&apos;re looking at more like 4.75#.
I&apos;ll be back in on Saturday.

Thanks,

 I bought one of the Wiggy&apos;s Kifaru specials in 20/30 degree configuration and an overbag. That combination is supposed to be comfortable down to about -10 or -20 degrees. The last time I used it up in the mountains the temperature got close to freezing (not below) but I was so cold I got only a couple hours sleep. I concluded that I simply can&apos;t rely on it even for moderately cold conditions. Now I only use it for warm-weather early fall dove hunts out on the eastern plains. I&apos;ll never buy another Wiggy&apos;s bag. Posted by: MarcTaylor

 That a Wiggy&apos;s bag kept you warm, doesn&apos;t do &quot;achadwick&quot; much good. For whatever reason, Wiggy&apos;s seems to fall into one of those &quot;love &apos;em or hate &apos;em&quot; categories. The guys that like them, really like them. The ones that don&apos;t, don&apos;t. File it under &quot;Y&quot; for &quot;Your mileage may vary,&quot; I suppose. Posted by: 1akhunter

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/24/08 07:19 AM 
 I ended up making a couple small incisions the cord-tube of my mountain hunter. From there, I cut the crappy cordage but left 1.5&quot; still attached. I attached superior cordage with a sheet bend and pulled it through. I repaired the incisions with ripstop taffeta repair material.

The collar is now fully functional once again, the taffeta repairs are holding fine, and the new cordage simply cannot be chewed up by a cordlock nor jammed by one.

The last storm we had dropped 49&quot; in a day. There is a huge pile of snow in the parking lot of the office. I&apos;m thinking that next friday I&apos;ll build a snow cave after work and fiddle with the bag; maybe some others. I&apos;m curious what the ambient temps would be inside the cave.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 02/24/08 08:53 AM 
 I have a Wiggy&apos;s Super Lite 0F bag, and I am neither a lover or a hater of the bags. Mine came close to the advertised weight, and is very lofty. I havent been able to test it at 0F, just havent had that cold of weather this year, but did test it around 5-10F and it was fine with just a pair of merino bottoms and a merino top, with socks and hat, so I&apos;m sure it will perform down to 0F. For a bag this heavy and lofty, there seems no reason why it shouldnt. I dont know if there is a quality control issue with Wiggy&apos;s (maybe like Kimber) that makes people love them or hate them, I cant explain why there is such a difference in opinions. I bought my Wiggy&apos;s bag before I was able to read a lot of what Wiggy has written on some message boards, and I agree, it is very off putting. Honestly, I probably wouldnt have bought one had I read some of his writings before hand, he doesnt sound like someone I would get along with, and I dont like all the drama. I understand some people have personal problems with Wiggy and therefore give his bags a bad review. I said SOME people, not ALL, so dont bite my head off. I am writing this for someone interested in buying a Wiggy&apos;s bag, like the person who started this thread, and doesnt know anything about it, like the person who started this thread or me when I bought a Wiggy&apos;s bag last year. I think a Wiggy&apos;s bag will work just fine, that&apos;s been my experience, I dont think there is anything amazing about them, and I dont think they are the best bags either, and they are deffinently not the lightest, (that is something that is claimed in the Wiggy&apos;s hand book that is un-true). It is not my main go-to bag, but, I also probably wont be selling it, I&apos;ll keep it around. The fact these bags work when wet is not something out of the ordinary, they are a synthetic filled bag, and any well made synthetic bag will do the same thing, heck, even the cheap ones might? I bought my Wiggy&apos;s bag last year, and the price was something like $160, much more attractive than their current price of $220 (for the 0F bag). My opinion is you can probably get by just fine with a Wiggy&apos;s, but, for the price, there&apos;s alot more options, some are alot better options (IMO), and at the price of $220, for just a bit more, you can get a top of the line bag of your choice. So, I recommend that you just do your research, and like others have said, we&apos;ve got alot of options now days, and if you pick one of the higher-end bags you probably cant go wrong. Now I do have a question that I&apos;ve never been able to get an answer about, maybe Marc Taylor, being a Wiggy&apos;s distributor,(and possibly having conversations with Wiggy himself?)can finally give me an answer to.
MarcTaylor- Do you have any idea why Wiggy chooses not to include a draft collar with his sleeping bags? I dont know if all his bags are made this way, but my Super Lite doesnt have a draft collar and I find this strange. Is it a weight cutting measure? Doesnt make sense on a bag already as heavy as it is, what&apos;s another couple ounces? I&apos;m a fan of the draft collar, especially on a winter bag, and I am curious about the design. Thanks for your time. Josh Posted by: ken999

 Draft collar???...WHAT??, are you an idiot?? You CAN&apos;T cut the radiator off from the engine and expect to stay warm!!!...sheesh...

Tounge in cheek of course...lol... 

I&apos;d prefer my WKS (Mnt. Hunter) to have a draft collar also...but it doesn&apos;t...I usually stuff a spare tee-shirt or LU top up around my head to help close off all drafts. I&apos;m a back sleeper that can get away with that sorta thing though...

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/01/08 02:42 PM 
 After reading all the stuff on this thread, I went and dug my old 1989 Wiggys Ultra Light out of its storage sack. And in my files, I found the original booklet that came with the sleeping bag when I bought it at the old Muddy Waters store in Kansas City.

In the last 19 years the bag has been used for as little as a week to as much as two months or more per year. And it had slowly turned into a summer weight bag or my thin overbag for cold deer camps.

As I reread the booklet, I had forgotten how much Wiggys emphasized washing their bags after ever trip to bring back the loft. And they say to do it at home in any kind of washer. As I could not remember the last time I had washed mine, maybe it was overdue.

When I first got this bag I had measured the two-layer loft at 4-inches, just as specified. Now it was right at 2-inches before I shoved it in our top-loading washer. I half expected this almost 20-year-old bag to come out of the washer in pieces, but it looked ok. Then an hour on low heat in the dryer and air dried over night. It now looks almost as good as new, nice and puffy, and the loft measures just over 3-inches.

Losing less than an inch of loft (25%) in almost 20 years for a well-used synthetic insulated sleeping bag-outstanding! Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/01/08 03:16 PM 
 The only thing negative that I can say about the Wiggys bag that I just bought less than a month ago, is its weight. I have a lot of sleeping bags in the house and non of them weigh as much as the Wigys 0 degree Superlight I got from Marc. It is comfy and roomy no doubt, but I am now wondering how much use it will even get seeing as everytime I pick it up (as I have been messing with loading my new pack)it reminds me how heavy it is. I am guessing it weighs near 5 lbs in its compression sack. I may retire it to 4wheeler/river boat hunts, but that kind of saddens me as I havent even had it a month or used it even once. Theres a lot of 0 degree bags out there that weigh a whole bunch less, and even a whole bunch below 0 rated bags out there that weigh less than this 0 degree bag.Makes a guy wonder why they havent ligtened these babies up a bit.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/01/08 03:28 PM 
 I made my Superlight my car camping bag until I sold it. It did fine in that role as long as temps stayed above 20 degrees. Posted by: AkMtnHntr 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/03/08 03:17 PM 
 Cub, before you retire that bag to the wheeler/boat, you should at least give it try. According to the Wiggy&apos;s site that bag should weigh 4 lbs, not 5. You can even shave a few ounces off that by leaving the stuff sack at home and just cram it down inside the pack if you have the room. If you need a stuff sack then go to REI and get a compression bag, thats what I did and I can compress my Ultralight down to the size of football. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/03/08 05:38 PM 
 The two l/w Superlights I&apos;ve weighed went 5 1/2 in their stuff sacks. Another one a friend owns weighs the same, or so he says. Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/03/08 09:06 PM 
 Mine is a Reg/Broad chest, and I&apos;d be willing to bet money that mine is right at or over 5lbs in its compression sack. Theres no way to stuff this thing down in my pack without a compression sack as it has tons of loft, it&apos;d fill the pack. Posted by: ken999

 They are heavy, thats for sure, I like them for base camp bags or packed/flown in hunts.

For true backpacking we&apos;ve used them, with and without stuff sacks but very bulky, we are using down bags now instead for backpacking, do everything needed to make sure they stay dry and all is well.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/04/08 01:42 PM 
 If backpacking, why not buy a backpacking Wiggy bag? Say, the Glacier Hunter or Mountain Hunter? NEITHER of those weighs more than 3.5#.

Not much backpacking takes place at or around 0-degrees does it? I mean, there will be snow and chances are a pulk will be the mode of transport for the gear. On the other hand, if you want the extra temperature rating, then you&apos;ve got to put up with extra weight...

But partially what I&apos;m hearing in the last few posts is, &quot;I got more bag than I paid for...&quot; That can be a good thing if you live in Alaska, especially.

Only the Regular/Regular weighs 4#, and yes, that can be misleading when there are two larger sizes available. I concede that, and fit very few men in a Regular/Regular bag.

By-the-way, since this thread is a Wiggy&apos;s thread, Jerry is getting hammered by the Chinese to start building his bags overseas. Of course, he WON&apos;T consider it, but what it does say, and they&apos;ve spoken it:
1) He&apos;s selling alot of bags, and they know it and want a part of it.
2) Other manufacturers are cutting back on their orders.

Hmmmm...&lt;wink&gt;

 HEAR,HEAR, we DO NOT NEED ANY more Wiggy&apos;s-Kifaru antagonism HERE on THIS forum. It benefits NOBODY and causes a lot of hard feelings that inhibit the free interchange of useful information and developement of friendships.

I will say that much of MY backapcking has taken place at temps. from 0*F to much lower and I do at least 2-3 trips per annum in that type of cold, even a lot of my hunting trips are at 0*F.

Once it is colder consistently than 10*F, I abandon my synthetic bags for my down bags and the Valandre Shocking Blue I just scored due to a wonderful friend in the US, is PERFECT for this type of weather. I expect to use this bag and my Western Mountaineering Alpinlite Super for MOST of my backpacking now and only use my synthetics for specific purposes.

The WM-AS weighs ONE POUND-FIFTEEN OUNCES and the V-SB is THREE POUNDS-TWO OUNCES and will keep me comfy to -10 or -15*F, now, THAT is the way to go for geezers like me. Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/04/08 04:56 PM 
 Kute,

What&apos;s your overall impression of the Valandre? Specifically, do you like the shel material and the Antouinette collar? Some of the reviews seem to suggest the collar works well but takes a lot of getting used in order to make adjustments by feel. Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/04/08 05:35 PM 
 This is the best sleeping bag I have ever seen, it&apos;s that simple. I was sceptical as I have seen a lot of gear come and go, but, these ARE as good as they are touted to be and damm little gear is, IME.

The collar DOES require getting used to, BUT, in REAL cold, it WILL do more than ANY other I have used and I have had bags from many of the best makers, worldwide. I LOVE this shell material and it is the first non-WPB fabric I will trust in BC winters.

I am pretty large and need room, so, this is a long and it fits with a level of comfort that beats any of my other bags, while the &quot;drape&quot;over your recumbent form is unbelievable and THIS is CRUCIAL in using a light bag in real cold.

If, you want something really special, I would look at the Freya bag that Valandre offers, it should suit you perfectly and much as I hate to admit it, these are BETTER than ID, FF or, gasp, horrors, even WM, not much, but it is there.

I do not know if anyone is now importing these, they are BIG BUX now, but, Charlie might know as he has one, IIRC. Posted by: MarcTaylor 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/04/08 05:43 PM 
 Hampstead,
&quot;Think not.&quot; That&apos;s your prerogative, but some sleeping bag manufacturers are going to great lengths to copy what Wiggy&apos;s has done:
-Slumberjack is recently BUYING Lamilite for some of their bags?! Say it isn&apos;t so...
-How about that new &quot;Slick Bag&quot;?! That &quot;old school, outdated&quot; design looks pretty good in one of these, though, huh?
-Mountain Hardwear&apos;s &quot;Lamina&quot;. It&apos;s not quilted? Well, that&apos;s a coincidence, but the continuous filament insulation runs the length of the bag instead of the radial; now that is a FATAL flaw! Ever seen the inside of one of these after just ONE washing?

Others are selling off or getting out of the sleeping bag business because of shrinking market share.
-Remember the MountainSmith sleeping bag? Two years now since the last one was made.
-Ask Integral Designs about Market Share right now... Hell, they&apos;ll sell you the whole company it&apos;s so good!

Now what&apos;s the use of being in business without sales? Sales on the level that I&apos;m accustomed to are driven by past reputation. Sales drives reputation where quality is present, and reputation in turn drives sales! That&apos;s how most businesses stay in business.

Welcome to the mediocre and ungrateful world of internet forums!

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/04/08 06:00 PM 
 In conversation with Evan Jones, owner of Integral Designs, last week, he clearly indicated to me that his focus is on meeting the government contracts that he has and were such a major part of his original startup in the business. The &quot;market share&quot; in respect of recreational gear, especially at the top level of quality where he and a very few others exist, has very little impact on his business.

The &quot;sale&quot;of his firm, oft touted, is NOT what is happening as Mr. T implies and while I know a bit about this, it is not my place to make it public. I would, however, suggest, that ANYONE making &quot;broadbrush&quot; comments be prepared to give specific quotes based on conversation with EVAN, not industry rumours, to substantiate such rhetoric.

I rather doubt that ANY among us wishes a return to any form of &quot;Wiggy&apos;s Wars&quot; HERE as this is the place where a LOT of guys come to relax, make friends and learn. So, perhaps this might be a consideration in future comments? Posted by: stillhunter73

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 03:46 AM 
 No, I cannot as what little and accurate info. I have was given to me in confidence and I am a man who is very rigid concerning such issues. I have no doubt that Evan would very likely sell for the right price, many owners of specialty businesses WILL as I did when offered 3.5 times in CASH, what I had paid for my small, independent specialty retail operation and as have others I have known.

Passing along what you hear is fine, BUT, using this to imply that a given maker is somehow not doing well due to an inferior product or lack of business deriving therefrom is NOT and that is how your post reads.

My experience with Integral Designs is that they make some of the finest gear I have used/seen in over 50 years of active western and northern Canadian outdoor activity. Their synthetic bags are the BEST I have used, ever and are far superior to the Wiggy&apos;s Kifaru Special that I bought, used and gave away. My ID bag that weighs the same out-performed the Wiggy&apos;s by quite a margin in tests done side by side and I have not seen ANY deterioration of that &quot;garbage&quot; Primaloft insulation nor has anyone else I know who has one of these bags or other ID gear with Pl. filling.

You are NOT the only person here who tests gear before using it, there ARE some guys here who very likely have FAR more wilderness time than you do and I object to your using what I consider an inappropriate method of promoting Wiggy&apos;s by implying some problems with ID&apos;s sales.

Quality is NOT the same as quantity and although Wiggy may well sell bazillions more bags than ANY other maker, his products that I have seen are NOT equal to ID, WM, Valandre or the old Feathered Friends. His claims about the heat &quot;production&quot; of the human body and consequent commentary concerning draught collars are NOT correct in respect of molecular catabolism, which is what GENERATES the &quot;heat&quot;in the human body. Thus, Wiggy promotes scientifically inaccurate &quot;information&quot; in order to continually denigrate other maker&apos;s products and promote his own......

THAT speaks for itself..............

I can go into exhaustive, precise and documented detail on this issue if you wish, however, I think that most here know very well what the situation is and would prefer a &quot;finis&quot; to the Wiggy situation here. I don&apos;t care who does and does not ...hate..., but, I DO care about passing incomplete and thus possibly damaging information about other makers/posters. Posted by: Hampstead

No hate or discontent, just white shoes, polyester jacket, slicked-back hair, &quot;what&apos;s it gonna take to get you into one of these fine new Wiggy&apos;s bags&quot; sales pitches post after post.

If sales data was the metric for quality, Wal-Mart would be the retailer of the finest outdoor gear on the planet and McDonald&apos;s would receive three stars from Michelin. We wouldn&apos;t be talking about Wiggy&apos;s or ID or WM or the Valandre Shocking Blue... we&apos;d be talking about the flannel-lined Coleman.

I don&apos;t want a Wiggy&apos;s flame war. I just want to enjoy the backpacking forum without the Wiggy&apos;s version of a carnival barker trying to sell everyone tickets to the greatest bag on earth. This is not a sales floor, it&apos;s an Internet forum where outdoorsman help other outdoorsman. If Mr. Taylor wants to sell sleeping bags, he can do so in his Alaska venue or through a web site or on a local street corner. As one member of the campfire, I would respectfully prefer that if outdoor gear sales clerks want to join the camraderie and general fat chewing, they leave their sales presentations at the door.

That makes me wonder if I can take a FLC, pour a cup of water on it, then hop in it wearing 3.5 lbs of synthetic clothing at zero to see if I can make the night... Posted by: stillhunter73

The 3-ply supplex shell material of the support clothing would likely bore a hole in the already disabled bag as I turned in misery through the night. On the other hand, the noise from that material would surely help SAR find me, given I continue to twitch and wiggle. Posted by: stillhunter73

There it is in a nutshell. Excellent post.

A couple of years ago I was looking at some new riding saddles offered by a retailer. I explained what I was looking for. His response was &quot;I don&apos;t have that, but I sell alot of these&quot; pointing out a very pretty looking saddle. I looked and said that it would not hold up where I ride and the way I ride. He responded sayin, &quot;they&apos;re pretty good and I sell a lot of them, I mean, I sell a lot of them. I told him I don&apos;t give a chit how many you sell, that AIN&apos;T what I&apos;m looking for, thanked him for his time anyway, and left.

Folks here are kind enough to offer advice, with a few exceptions, based on what has worked for them. the great thing is, if a guy can use those tidbits, take them and put them to use. If not, leave the advice in the thread.

Anyone who has been around the backpacking forum knows sales pitch from pure advice. Taylor uses and sells Wiggy products. They apparently work for him. They may work for other guys&apos; applications....or not. Find your system, and get out there! Posted by: Hampstead 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 10:57 AM 
 Thanks. I have come to a point in my life where I can buy the gear I want and I really don&apos;t have to ask &quot;how much&quot; unless I feel so inclined. When I was a younger man, I didn&apos;t seem to mind a lack of comfort. Now I&apos;m at a point where I just don&apos;t feel like being cold, wet or otherwise miserable. I don&apos;t want to fight my gear, and Lord knows, I have had a few &quot;brush fits&quot; where lousy equipment was disposed of in a less than ceremonious fashion.

Maybe it&apos;s a function of age, but I don&apos;t like salespeople buzzing in my ear like no-see-ums. It&apos;s not that I know everthing. In fact, I am pretty sure I don&apos;t know much, but what I do know, I am pretty sure about. With the patina of age, I don&apos;t have a problem asking a question when I need an answer... but I also have no patience for a sales clerk trying to knit me an answer out of a basket of assumption-colored yarn. I have survived my share of close calls in the hard places without the benefit of the world-class gear I now own. While I had the advantages of youth like strength and stamina, I also had a good deal more stupid in my pack. I did some things in the day that explain some of my gray hair.

For the most part, I figure talking about gear is just an congenial way to pass the time of day when we&apos;re sitting inside instead of sitting where we belong. It&apos;s mostly about tweaking and tuning and fussin&apos; the way we do as we get older and more persnickity about our lash ups. I&apos;m always interested in learning a new trick or two and keeping my ear to the ground for some Tom Foolish way to spend a few more dollars... but I just don&apos;t have the disposition for a whole lot of selling.

 So this banter since my last post is constructive on a thread entitled &quot;Wiggy&apos;s Sleeping Bags&quot;?

Hampstead asked whether anyone would be following in Wiggy&apos;s shoes and I answered that. What the hell is wrong with that?

About I.D. - That rumor was buzzing around the Outdoor Retailer Winter Show this year in SLC! Just calling it like I hear it, that&apos;s all. I don&apos;t care to buy the company but I do get to express my opinion when I please. My opinion: &quot;That&apos;s not a good place to have a rumor flying around that your sleeping bag company is up for sale...&quot;

So if you guys don&apos;t like what&apos;s being said on a Wiggys thread. DON&apos;T READ IT! Otherwise, expect to go back and forth with me each and every time. I&apos;ll hear the same crap from you and you&apos;ll hear the same crap from me.

Stillhunter73 - It&apos;s 2-ply Supplex&lt;wink&gt;

I heard a rumor that your store is closing and all prices are 60% off.

Oh, I also heard a rumor that you&apos;re being sued too. Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 01:51 PM 
 Mark, I can almost say you make it kind of fun. 

As I&apos;ve said before, there&apos;s nothing about it that&apos;s gonna mess with my zen. I gave &apos;em a whirl, to be sure.

Hampstead has a great way of illustrating his point and he&apos;s a fun read, for certain.

Tell you what: If you replaced that Mountain Hunter, I&apos;d give another one a solid run for it&apos;s money and rate it fairly. Thing is, the one you&apos;d be taking back has had surgery to replace the cordage as the original cordage got so bound in the cordlock that I had to cut my way out of the thing.

I&apos;d review a replacement bag like it was day one. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 01:58 PM 
 Gonna test the warranty eh? Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 02:03 PM 
 I definatly would. If he guaranteed me a brand new replacement, I&apos;d start from day one and keep my mouth shut until I had some decent amount of time in it.

I&apos;m curious to find out if they&apos;re still stealing kids shoelaces and running them through the collars....

You don&apos;t have a ton of trouble with yours, but I did with mine. I&apos;d give him a best in three evaluation on performance provided my own money isn&apos;t on the table this time.

For all I know, a lot of techniques in it&apos;s construction may have improved; you know how progressive and forward-thinking JW is

I&apos;d have to say that counts against his eutopian store now, doesn&apos;t it???

So much for service.

Hell, when I needed pole replacements for my tent, my &quot;outfitter&quot; (the guy I bought the Hilleberg from) brokered the whole fix......

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 04:29 PM 
 You butchered the bag and you expect him to give you a new one?? Use what you want man, no skin off my back. Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 04:36 PM 
 Sure I&apos;ll use what I want. Peace to you, btw.

I&apos;m not sure I butchered the bag. If the crappy cordage jammed so bad I couldn&apos;t get my head through it, is cutting the cordage really butchering? Seems to me I took a crappy bag and made the sucker work a lot longer than some of the other guys who decided to hate it...

I couldn&apos;t have finished the trip if I was unable to work the hood, you know...

If he wants to sell the stuff here, he can certainly warrantee it here, don&apos;t you agree?

My offer was honorable and up-front. I&apos;d give fair review to the entire process, of replacing and using the bag . Initiated here, where the bag is said to sell. Since guys come here, read the posts, and buy accordingly, they should be able to see a service-issue in action, as well.

His big nemesis, Kifaru, does such routinely on their message board. True, despite my departure... Posted by: ironbender

 I read that post you made a few pages back, you cut the material to put in a new cord so you didn&apos;t just cut the cord. Anyhow, take it up with Taylor, I was just passing along what i&apos;ve been told about the Wiggy&apos;s warranty and how I thought it would go down. I;&apos;m sure Marc will correct me if I&apos;m wrong. Ciao. Posted by: stillhunter73 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 04:44 PM 
 Besides, I denigrated the performance on the bag, heavily based on loss of loft and experience with coldness. Those complaints weren&apos;t relative to the draft collar (I mean lack of) or its closures (I mean closure). The dang thing lost loft, got laundered, lost more loft, got laundered, lost loft/jammed cord, and went on hangar.

Are the Lords of Lamilite not willing to satisfy a customer? Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 04:50 PM

Mark better correct you, friend. Of course I didn&apos;t &quot;just cut the cord&quot;. What the hell good is a bag with no cord? Especially, a bag with no draft collar to begin with??! I used expediant means to make the most of a bad scenario. I suffered the cut cord for the trip, and replaced it (my way) to use it on another field test. One, btw, I decided would be gentlemanly not to post. I figured I couldn&apos;t/shouldn&apos;t badger them for my improvisation. Nonetheless, I&apos;ve complained like crazy about aspects of the bag, and worked arduously to see it through to my needs.

I&apos;m pretty sure that if you ordered a Mountain Hunter Bag, but specified &quot;excellent cordage&quot;, you&apos;d be admonished and given a &quot;Mountain Hunter&quot;.

I&apos;ve given them a chance to re-satisfy a customer. I&apos;m dealing direct to the guy that &quot;swiped my card&quot;, and I&apos;m doing it right where he gets his customers and touts his wares. I&apos;m offering to re-evaluate my opinion of all: product, man, firm with total honesty. Can&apos;t see this as a lose proposition, and I can hardly see it as a trap.

I&apos;m not aligned with any maker of anything, spend my own money on everything I have, and care less about allegiance. Just got a $200 wonder-bag that screwed the pooch, but supposedly came with a rock-solid warrantee... Posted by: stillhunter73

 I want a touch of truth. I want a 20 degree lamilite bag that works at 20 degrees. I want a warrantee honored. I want it done here where so much salesmanship has been put forth. I want a cord that dont have a propensity to jam in the lock. I want all this and not to ever speak to JW.

I would shut up if the bag performed.

 Stillhunter73 - I sent you a bag just like mine. My hood cord is still intact and it&apos;s my go-to bag. I guess you just have to know how to operate a cord-lock properly and not strip the cord through it?

But your warrantee is as good as anyone else&apos;s. Why haven&apos;t you already given the warranty a try? Much too much fun just to find a Wiggy thread and complain, I guess...

Wash it, stick it in a box with an explanation and maybe a copy of the receipt if you have one, and mail it back. Wiggy&apos;s, Grand Junction is where the repair or replace will take place and it&apos;s farther to Alaska, so I suggest you send it to G.J. You&apos;ll get back either a new bag or a repaired bag; just like anyone else...

I&apos;ve returned 6 bags in four years to Wiggy&apos;s, and it will be the first for a stripped cord. Noted. I&apos;ve seen bear-mauled bags, drier-burned bags, dog-chewed bags and just plain worn-out bags, but never a stripped-cord bag. There&apos;s a first for everything, I guess.

If you&apos;re looking for something for nothing, however, we&apos;re not in the business of sticking pacifiers in the mouths of &apos;were never-gonna-be-satisfied-no-matter-what&apos; customers.

Now, you want to put up? Or shut up? But you sound like a spoiled 12-year-old man.

Well Mark, that really sums it up, don&apos;t it. You &quot;may or may not&quot; back your service. I guess I&apos;d have to send it to the Gestapo that made the thing to find out. No cordage issues????? I guess I&apos;m a real rare find then, eh?

Incidentally, if this bag was so bombproof, how is it that I&apos;m looking for something for nothing?????? Sorry, I just don&apos;t follow you there. I got bags from Moonstone, WM, Big Agnus, and on and on. Apart from suggesting that Moonstone go with a better zipper, I haven&apos;t had a complaint.

On the other hand, I&apos;ve sent defective products back to Snow Peak, Kifaru, and Hilleberg within the last few months. All remedied.

Only with you, here, was it ever suggested that I was looking for a free-lunch. No other csr srvc rep, or manager ever used this in their resolution:

The one time your Mountain Hunter bag will truly be warm will be when I douse it with lighter fluid and cast it afire, Marc.

Thanks for absolutely proving my point about who you really are and what your outfit is about. Frankly, I thought I&apos;d actually have to wrangle with you over a return. Maybe business isn&apos;t so sharp as you thought this morning?

What else do you sell?

Buyer beware if you read this thread through. I invested heavily in his products. This IS how you will be treated if you disagree.

I can tell you how to make that bag 98.6 degrees warm... Haah!

Still with you, bud.

Taylor 

How is that something for nothing, Marc? How exactly, did you call my bluff when I&apos;ve been as upfront and forward about this as a guy can get?

Put simply, If you can manage to find a stuff sack that allows that Mountain Hunter to cram itself up your A$$ I&apos;d love to know the maker of that sack . You did your own deal here, bucko, and I offerred you a a good return on a &quot;Warrantee&quot;. You wanted to send that return policy up my ass.

Marc, you are definatley the gear-guy for me..... 

It would amaze me if a lot of guys still ask questions about you and Wiggy beyond this post....

I got a &quot;screwing dogs post&quot; that I&apos;m just dying to send... Posted by: stillhunter73

 Guys will lament about the &quot;degradation&quot; of the Wiggy thread.

They should do well to read the way it was handled. As a user/csr, I left a LOT of room for forgiveness. I own a Superlight, 2 overbags, a mountain hunter, and a Ultima Thule.

That&apos;s a significant investment to think you get called names on a return.

Final Note: The name calling didn&apos;t start with me; though I choose to not suggest what I may post further. Posted by: deflave

 OK, I&apos;m shopping for a bag and just finished reading this thread. I kind a&apos; want the last 30 minutes of my life back, but, I&apos;m confused.

Is stillhunter getting a return on his bag from your store Marc? Or does he have to send it to the manufacturer?

This is an honest question.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 06:26 PM 
 The honest answer, friend, is that &quot;Stillhunter&quot; is getting boned. It&apos;s rather simple in that regard.

deflave, Have you read ANYTHING in this thread to give you security toward your purchase???????????

I don&apos;t have a dog in the fight but if you thihk this bunch is gonna hook you up, you are sadly wrong.

Wash it, stick it in a box with an explanation and maybe a copy of the receipt if you have one, and mail it back. Wiggy&apos;s, Grand Junction is where the repair or replace will take place and it&apos;s farther to Alaska, so I suggest you send it to G.J. You&apos;ll get back either a new bag or a repaired bag; just like anyone else...

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/05/08 06:40 PM 
 Sure, send it to me. It just takes longer to do the turnaround as I have to then forward it to Grand Junction. Upon resolution, they will then forward it to the customer if that is closer.

We&apos;re talking Oswego NY to Anchorage AK, then to Grand Junction, CO; and back to Oswego.

OR

Oswego to Grand Junction to Oswego, that&apos;s all.

Just as I drop ship a NEW bag to a lower-48 customer from Grand Junction to save him some shipping if it actually does.

The RETURN OPTION has always been open. I&apos;ve never received a phone call, PM or email to this effect, &quot;Hey, Marc, I had a problem with this bag you sold me&quot;; just get to banter about it on the internet at the amusment of myself and a few others.

Deflave orders a bag through Marc, but it gets sent from Colorado to save him some money. Dave has a problem after receiving the bag, he can contact me or Grand Junction, then send the bag straight to Grand Junction or all the way back to me.

Which would you prefer? Neither has the customer talking to Wiggy&apos;s at all, just put a note in the box and ship it.

Seems simple. But I would welcome a courtesy call from my customer as he is still my customer. Ranting on forum, thread after thread about an old problem that is warranteed but the customer would rather rant than get it resolved is NOT courtesy.

No?

I&apos;m gonna have to incidentally stir this pot further because of my ignorance. Who is in Grand Junction? The manufacturer?

As far as &quot;ranting&quot; I certainly have nothing against you or your store Marc but complaining about gear and praising gear is the reason most of us learning about this stuff log on to these forums.

I have been guilty of giving some stuff bad reviews myself on this forum. Some of that stuff I have not returned cause I figured I&apos;d just &quot;eat it&quot; rather than going through the problem of returning it. But if the person I purchased that product from was defending it on the same forum, well.............

  Originally Posted By: Hampstead A sleeping bag is a lot like a boot. There are a lot of variables and it&apos;s often a matter of &quot;fit.&quot; I have no interest in Wiggy&apos;s for a couple of reasons. One, I have found sleep systems that work for me so I&apos;ll stay with companies like Integral Designs or Big Agnes. Two, I&apos;m allergic to drama. 

Wiggy wars are legendary on some backpacking and hunting gear forums. The founder of Wiggy&apos;s, Jerry Wigutow, is has a sort of scorched earth approach to marketing and to interacting with the folks on the &apos;net. So do some of his ardent supporters. Asking for opinions on Wiggy&apos;s, I&apos;m guessing that you&apos;ll get more heat than light. 

I went back to my original post on this thread and underlined a couple of sentences for emphasis. Despite the &quot;rumors&quot; of other manufacturers going broke, we live in great times for a breathtaking array of gear choices. Before this thread started, I hadn&apos;t given much thought to the Valandre Shocking Blue , but now that devil, Kute, has me thinking. 

Here&apos;s my deal. Years ago, as an aspiring writer of sorts, I wrote a story about the climber, Kim Momb, after he died as the result of an avalanche. Momb made the East Face summit of Everest in &apos;83. I interviewed his friends, his parents and fellow climber, John Roskelley... all great people. Growing up in Montana, I was taught that serious folks don&apos;t toot their own horns. I learned that serious mountaineers like Roskelley are very much that way. I admire understatement and modesty. This may explain my natural aversion to used car salesmen, television preachers and other snake oil peddlers. The Wiggy&apos;s people just get in my way when it comes to the Wiggy&apos;s bags. Fortunately, it&apos;s a big world out there and there are still enough bag makers with heads above water to give us some dandy choices. Posted by: map

 I&apos;d just like to say that I&apos;m new to real backpacking. This stuff is insanely expensive just like anything else worth doing.

One thing that I&apos;ve noticed about BP hunting is it crosses roads with the granola eating community that wants to &quot;preserve&quot; not conserve. That worries me because the hunting community DEMANDS great warranty service.

Therefore, I want to buy from people that have the good gear the eco-freaks want but stand behind their stuff like the real outdoorsmen want.

If Marc is saying send it to the manufacturer, well, let&apos;s just say I don&apos;t think Midway or cameralandny would do that. Hell, I even doubt Sportsmans Warehouse would do that if I put their feet to the fire.

Marc,

Maybe you just aren&apos;t conveying your exact thoughts clearly and I&apos;m misunderstanding. But it does not read well to a &quot;newbie&quot;.

 On the ID Emperor bag, this is not really a backpacking sack, it is more suited to vehicles and boats, due to bulk and weight.

What DOES work even BETTER, IME, is the ID North Twin plus Andromeda Overbag, this combo will do it ALL, except for severe subh-zero cold and I have used mine hard for three years with zero complaints.

This is the best hunting bag(s) that I have used, but, it costs a bit more than an Emperor. Posted by: 1akhunter

 I dunno kute with a challenge like THAT, he may decide to call your bluff and just go move to the middle of the woods and wait it out and then come back and post!


How many years would he have to stay out? (just funnin)


believe he stated he is new to this, I don&apos;t think most folks that hunt want to pave paradise, but he&apos;s just trying to delineate between hunters and non hunters. I could be wrong, but that&apos;s how I read it.

as an aside though, while the lycra spandex crowd ain&apos;t my cup of tea, I&apos;ve been put into proximity to them mostly hanging out at airports and strips waiting for weather to clear to catch a bush plane, and they aren&apos;t all clueless about getting around out there, and some of them are in danged good shape and they love the outdoors, they just aren&apos;t in to the hunting gig. must be a different blood type, I guess.

kutenay,

I think you greatly misunderstood my post. I was stating that in the hunting community, companies are known to stand behind their products. Retailers and manufacters for the most part. I don&apos;t know that some of these companies that cater to granolas provide the same type of service which is why I&apos;d rather buy from a retailer that cater&apos;s to a guy that hunts.

By real outdoorsmen, you are the exact type of person I&apos;m referring to. I&apos;ve read many of your posts.

Thank you for assuming I don&apos;t know jackschit about the outdoors and that I&apos;ve &quot;NEVER spent as much as a single weekend alone even the suburban lower 48 wilderness.&quot;

While I respect your opinion on gear and the outdoors in general, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re capable of determining everything I&apos;ve done in my life. If you are greatly disrespected by the term granola , I apologize.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 04:57 AM 
 Here&apos;s a purely friendly suggestion, Kute. You may want to make the next pot decaf. 

For me, the deep green environmentalists are a bit like the Mormons... some of the nicest people you ever want to meet but I respectfully disagree with the theology. As with most things in my life, when it comes to the woods I&apos;m a rationalist. I think the best way to resolve wildlife and habitat issues through science. Our understanding of the planet is incomplete and my feelings about what &quot;works&quot; are open to change based on the advancement of human knowledge.

That makes me (and others) different than some of the deep green environmentalists. For at least some of them, the &quot;right&quot; way to live on the planet is a matter of faith, not science. The woods is a place I love, but don&apos;t worship. People who disagree with me on natural resource issues are just folks, not heretics. I count among my friends some serious &quot;tree huggers,&quot; but then again, I have friends of many religious bents.

As for gear, I think some of the green folks are just as serious, committed and hard core as anyone in the hunting community. There are world class mountaineers who have zero interest in hunting, but do not doubt that they know how to get up and go in some hard country. As a community of hunters, I think we would do well to embrace our brothers (and our sisters) and search for common ground on issues and informed opinions on gear. Posted by: Tx Trapper

In my limited time on the backpacking forum here, nothing gets as nasty as any thread that has &apos;Wiggys&apos; attached to it.

Don&apos;t let that sour you however, generally speaking the backpacking forum is the most informative as well as polite venue on the Campfire, IMO.
And Kutenay, Chawn, Brad, et all are good guys.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 07:49 AM 
 The post I reacted to made comments such as these:

...want to preserve, rather than conserve...

...real outdoorsmen...in a context which essentially stated that the ...eco-freaks...and ...granola eaters... are somehow NOT as much ...outdoorsmen...as hunters are.

The poster may well be young and a total novice as it appears, HOWEVER, to make comments like this here is highly disrespectful of those of us who ARE serious environmentalists and I am one of these. I am DEEP GREEN, always have been and ALWAYS WILL BE and it is/has been the guiding principle of my life for over 50 years.

SO, when someone first makes the &quot;good ol&apos;boy&quot; and &quot;bubba&quot; comments that this poster did and THEN implies that hunters like HIM are the ...real outdoorsmen..., wellllll, yeah, my patience tends to vanish. MOST of the &quot;hunters&quot;I have seen in my time in the bush were/are NOT as much of REAL outdoorsmen as the climbers, wilderness trekkers and horse packers I have known.

Sorry all to hell, but, paying a BC guide to spot a sheep with an aircraft and tell your guide it&apos;s location by radio and then shooting it, having the guide cape and pack it out so you can mount it on your wall in Dallas-Fort Worth for all your S.C.I. buddies to admire.....that ain&apos;t hunting!

This is just one of those things that really pushes my buttons and I will drop it now as my point is made and it will serve no good purpose to continue with it. Posted by: 340boy

I don&apos;t know if you read my initial response to you on the last page or not. If you read it I think you will see that I was referring to people like yourself as real outdoorsmen...not me.

I also plainly apologized for the use of the word granola if it offends you or anyone else.

While I am a novice in comparison to many on this forum, I don&apos;t think that entitles you to the right to state that I don&apos;t know a phucking thing about the outdoors. You&apos;ve never met me.

 I have nothing against the granola types neither....as long as it does not interfer with my hunting, if it does then we have a problem. This thread really went to sh!t since yesterday afternoon, thats to bad because it was probably one of the most civil Wiggy&apos;s threads on the internet. Chawn, you really dug a hole for yourself pardner with your complaining about the cordage. You must have received a bad bag from Taylor as the 2 I have work great. Send the damn bag bag and get a new one then light that one on fire and take some pics so we can see it firsthand and then we can put this thread to bed. Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 09:59 AM 
 Just a few minor disagreements, no major hatefests and maybe we all can learn from this, once in awhile. To make comments that can be misconstrued or even ARE offensive is going to elicit inchoate responses, that is just human nature and it&apos;s not that big a deal, IMHO.

BTW, I am NOT an outdoorsman, I AM a retired, FORMER outdoorsman who is now a recreationist and geezer and I do not attempt to be anything else. Posted by: ironbender

 Fair enough.

I sincerely hope nobody ever asks about Wiggy&apos;s bags again. I do believe this topic is cursed.

 I think black tea comes in decaf these days, Kute... just a thought. 

As for the &quot;green&quot; versus &quot;camo&quot; thing, this is often a clash of cultures. My family is mostly blue collar, hardscrabble, super conservative gypo logging hunters. This said, I have friends who are white collar, college-educated, super liberal, hybrid driving &quot;leave no trace&quot; backpackers. There are folks on both side of the fence that know and love the woods. On the other hand, I&apos;m not sure I would want put them all in a rig and listen to them argue about whether the radio should be turned to Rush Limbaugh or NPR.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 10:50 AM 
 LOL........lack of customer service?? Dude, did you even read any of this thread? Chawn NEVER contacted Taylor about getting a new bag yet he (Taylor) doesn&apos;t honor the warranty? Come on man, your not stupid, you know how this all works. You get a bad or damaged product, you contact the salesman that sold it to you and deal with it from there. When you buy a Remington from Sportsman&apos;s Warehouse and there&apos;s an issue with it, you don&apos;t take it back to the store, you send it to Remington, same with Wiggy&apos;s. So many people interpret these posts in the tone that they see fit instead of just reading and comprehending in what&apos;s being conveyed. Thats the biggest problem with internet forums these days.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 11:25 AM 
 aaaahhh now we&apos;re down to separating the fly chit from the pepper.


I like Chawn, but I gotta agree, it seems to me that he&apos;s got a hard on for Wiggy and/or Marc.

Reason I think so, is cause I&apos;ve felt the same way before.

imo the maker of Wiggy&apos;s bags is an unmitigated azzhole.

his bags are serviceable, but a long way from the greatest for my uses.

from phone conversations I think Marc is basically a good guy, but he&apos;s certainly not done himself or his biz any favors on the internet from my viewpoint.

he does do the outdoor stuff personally which is a plus for a guy that sells gear.

but even though he uses and reps Wiggy bags, I think he&apos;d be better served by taking his marketing lessons from a guy like Patrick at Kifaru.

imo Patrick is a class act, not all of his gear or style of hunting best suits &quot;my&quot; hunting style either, but I&apos;d be more inclined to drop dollars on his gear, just for the outstanding customer service he delivers and the laid back manner in which he presents his wares and his accomplishments or endeavors.

I know what I know about outdoor gear, and am pretty comfortable being able to make decisions based on my experience.

but I have learned from this thread.

I&apos;ve learned Hampstead is pretty much a voice of reason and I&apos;d think he&apos;d probably be a good companion to share a real campfire with.

same goes for many of you including ole ironbender.

guys got through with woolen blankets in the past as always it really comes down to the Indian and not his arrows. though good arrows are always welcomed by a good Indian.

from my perspective there&apos;s some good Indians hanging out around here.


we&apos;re lucky to have so many arrows to choose from. I know what type I like, and even what type of guy I like to make mine. Posted by: ironbender 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 11:39 AM 
 AMH-
Chawn should have contacted Taylor, I&apos;ll agree with that. Marc can&apos;t fix what he doesn&apos;t know about. Personally, I think there is more to the story than we&apos;ve read here.

My remarks regarding CS are directed to the belittling attitude expressed in the quote above. Insults are poor customer service. If the bag had been bought from my store, my response would have been more like the following. MT is free to copy and use it.
===============================================================
Stillhunter-

I&apos;m sorry you had trouble with the bag you bought from me. If you will send it to me I&apos;ll do whatever it takes to make the situation right. We at Wiggy&apos;s believe we make the best blah, blah, blah... so I will be happy to honor the warranty on your bag.

I sincerely wish you had emailed or phoned me with the problems you encountered so that we could fix this to achieve a more harmonious outcome.

Again, please accept my apologies for your troubles and send me the bag at your convenience.
============================================================== Posted by: AkMtnHntr 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 11:51 AM 
 That would be a good response but the apology part, I don&apos;t know man, Taylor wasn&apos;t the one at fault here and I think we all know that, hopefully Chawn will get satisfaction one way or the other. So, who&apos;s going bear hunting this spring?? Posted by: ironbender

 In real life, I run a fair-sized enterprise. We have some real good folks doing customer service. Every so often, they deal with some real unhappy and unpleasant people. We can&apos;t achieve 100 percent happiness, but we do give a 100 percent effort.

Customers exist on a Bell curve. At one end, you have a few customers who are always pretty easy to please. At the other, you have a few people who will never be satisfied. In the middle, you have the bulk of your customers who will respond positively to honesty, patience, communication and effort. There are very few products or services so perfect and necessary that a business can treat customers poorly. In fact, in a free market, a business that sucks at customer service is like a bleeding fish... the blood attracts competitors.

One of the best things about having a few nickels is the luxury of doing business with companies I enjoy. Even better is making those few nickels by being a great company. Posted by: kutenay

 I don&apos;t actually know many of the kinds of people you mentioned in your comment to me, I AM college-educated, auto-didactic in most aspects and have worn BOTH blue and white collars very successfully.

Gyppo loggers are, IME, more &quot;reactionary&quot;than truely conservative, as I am. I tend to annoy liberals in that I am not what they expect me to be after judging me by my speech and attitudes vis-a-vis the Biosphere.

I LOVE this breed and all dogs as well as cats, always have, always will.

Rottweilers are SO intelligent and loving, mine have just been a joy to us and my wife simply adores her mighty Axel, 120 lbs. of love and protection. I would have a dozen of them if I were on an acreage, if we were younger, we would show, train and breed them.

Funny, there HAVE been those who HAVE mentioned a certain similarity between Rotts and I, can&apos;t imagine why..... Posted by: Glacier_John 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 03:48 PM 
 I love em to, just kidding ya. I really like the look of AlaskaCub&apos;s dog, he looks very intellegent.

My wife and I run Golden retrievers in Field trials, we have four two old timers and two up and commers. It is a very intense sport and they are very good at it, but picking a Golden really goes against the grain as 95%-98% of the sport is Labrador Retrievers, I guess that says a lttle something about my contrary personality.

 Map, I can see how you might be just a bit bitter given the turn this thread has taken. However as much as you might need to search it out, I think you&apos;ve been given some sound advice particularly early on. No need for the tarp and woolen blanket. There are lots of good choices out there. Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 06:30 PM 
 Now, THAT is very interesting, I have been kinda hoping that the Kifaru folks WOULD do exactly that and, I seem to recall a certain guy from New York who mentioned this, as well.

One of THESE in a 0*F rating would really be a hell of a hunting bag here in B.C. I do NOT need another sleeping bag, gawd knows, but, this bag would certainly be among my first choices if I did.

The more quality choices, the better, IMHO. Posted by: map

 Map,

Maybe you should take a minute to pull your head out of your a$$.

You asked, you read...

I don&apos;t see all this &quot;attack&quot; that your sensitivities seem to tune into. Guys like &apos;em, guys don&apos;t.

You got a glimpse of the car-salesman in action, and you got to read a lot of other stuff, to boot.

Sounds like you might do some research and find out what Barbie and Ken tend to camp with.

As a matter of fact, it really sounds like you picked a favorite and thought this thread was going to massage your decision.

Map,

I haven&apos;t bothered to read this entire thread, however, as I read your initial posts on this thread you stated that your Alaskan guide required you to have a 0 degree synthetic bag.

If you are asking why you can&apos;t buy a down bag as your typical usage would permit this - that&apos;s up to you and your guide. I&apos;d say he&apos;s very concerned about your bag getting wet and you losing the effectiveness of your survival gear. Talk with your guide and ask if a waterproof stuff sack for a down bag would put him at ease - if not, buy a synthetic.

Keep in mind that each bag&apos;s ratings are up to the manufacturer and that everyone sleeps differently. I have a 15 degree bag and have slept down to 20 degree&apos;s in just a tee shirt, boxers and socks and slept well - others may have froze their azz off in the same bag wearing long underoos.

I did a quick search on the Mountain Gear website that MAY be suitable for your request.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/06/08 07:25 PM 
 Map, so far you have had recommendations from guys who like their Wiggy&apos;s bags -- that is what you asked about -- as well as recommendations for WM, Valandre and others if you like down and a host of others such as ID, Kifaru, BA, Marmot, SD, North Face etc. if you want to stick with synthetics. Frankly, I&apos;m amazed this thread went so smoothly for so long but helpful info has been put out there along the way from the very start. Unless you&apos;re going to give your money to some helpful forum member to buy for you, you&apos;re just going to have to make up you&apos;re own mind. You&apos;ve certainly been provided with plenty of the opinions you originally requested.

Now if you want to get a down versus synthetic debate going on top of the whole Wiggy&apos;s thing, everybody should buckle in and pop a whole bunch of popcorn. Posted by: map

 Heck, I thought there was a ton of good information on this thread and it was a veritable tea-and-crumpets affair given the usual level of napalm that occurs when the name &quot;Wiggy&apos;s&quot; appears in the heading.

Now, Map, this is not the drive up window at Bags-R-Us. The good folks here will try to answer questions, but there&apos;s going to be a bit of fat chewing along the way. As CCH aptly noted, if you don&apos;t mind a bit of palaverin&apos;, you can learn a great deal around the campfire... but as you can see from our neighbor to the north, Kute, a griz comin&apos; out of hibernation can be a teensy bit on the grumpy side. 

We can&apos;t read your mind, Map. I don&apos;t know if you are looking for good, good enough, great, or the best money can buy. I don&apos;t know if you are slight or wide, a restless sleeper or still as a stone, comfortable in a snug mummy or inclined to a loose fit, a human furnace or cold as a smelt, fussy or forgiving. I don&apos;t know if you like an overbag, a bivvy or a tent or some combination thereof. Giving advice on bags is like giving advice on boots, dogs, guns or women. A heckuva lots boils down to personal preference.

I think it&apos;s safe to say that Wiggy&apos;s is generally considered a competent, synthetic bag though a bit heavy compared to top drawer rigs. I think Integral Designs makes a darn fine synthetic. I like my Big Agnes for the room, the fit and because I flop like a Eastern Brook in my sleep... and the BA keeps me on the pad. I haven&apos;t used North Face since I was a pup. I know guys who are happy in Mountain Hardware. As noted earlier in this thread, it&apos;s nice to try before you buy. The zipper is the only moving part and God knows it can be a pain right in the backside. I&apos;m particular about zippers.

At the end of the day, Map, you&apos;re the one sleeping in the bag. You&apos;re the one living with your decisions. I would ask you be patient with us gear hounds as we are easily distracted by shiny objects and threadbare arguments. And whatever you decide, it will be a wiser decision having indulged our propensity to wander a bit away from the trail. Posted by: Glacier_John

Somethings you can&apos;t simply read your way to a solution. I&apos;d hazard a guess that bags, boots, and rifles all fit that reality.

I&apos;d buy one and get started, provided a rock-solid return policy. Posted by: map

 All we really need at this point to wrap this thread up is the picture of JW in the fishnets :(.

Map, I was in a similar place a couple years back. I was about to pull the trigger on a Wiggy&apos;s bag when a similar thread erupted over at Kifaru. The owner of Wiggy&apos;s was so out of line, not only in tearing into anyone who would not acknowledge that his bags were flawless and better than anything God could come up with, but also in his underhanded antics on that site (he was so bad that he was actually banned and then he signed back up under another username which was banned a second time) I went with a Big Agnes because of that alone. I realize that you don&apos;t like that Chawn has issues with MT or JW, but from my observations, I&apos;d at least consider it. Posted by: kutenay

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/07/08 04:58 AM 
 John makes a good point. What I hope you understand, Map, is that serious outdoorsman can be circumspect in giving advice about gear and such. I&apos;m not going to put myself in that elite company, but those fellas who spend serious time in the toolies using and busting all manner of gear often come to understand that what works for them may not work for everyone. Like with boots, optics or wives, success is about 90 percent &quot;fit.&quot; And, Map, we all have a different shape. Sheer modesty prevents me from any further comment. 

Up in the twigs, your life may depend on your gear. While this may sound strange, some of success or failure depends on your confidence in your kit. A sleeping bag you trust is warmer and drier. A rifle you trust shoots straighter. A woman you trust gets prettier every year.

You don&apos;t build trust in gear getting opinions on a Internet forum. Like all faith, it is built from within. While I pale in comparison to some of these bushmen, I have gear I know and trust. It&apos;s a trial and error process... every error is a trial. We want you to pick something, make it work and feel a little smarter than the rest of us. Your confidence may save your life someday... and it may save ours. We may be the ones humping the brush trying to find you.

As for this little &quot;GFO&quot; nonsense, Chawn and Map, we are civilized men here and we understand the need for civility. We&apos;re not high school girls text messaging a language made entirely of consonants. We are not drunks dropping &quot;f&quot; bombs like peanut shells on a bar floor. We are outdoorsman. We are civil when we pass on the trail and when sit around the campfire because the wilderness is God&apos;s true cathedral. We are also practical men and understand that the other guy, no matter how silly he may seem at a given moment, may be pulling our bacon out of the fire someday. We are civilized because we believe a passion for the wild places makes us better men.

Now, Chawn and Map, I will beg your forgiveness. You are grown men and I have prattled on like a father talking to his quarelling sons. I have overstepped my bounds and I apologize. Now, if you can forgive me, perhaps you can forgive one another and we can move on to a more congenial topic... like blondes versus brunettes versus redheads. Posted by: MtnHtr

 DISCLAIMER: This post is only intended for the original poster to hopefully add context. It is based on personal experience with the product mentioned and is not intended to start a flame war on what bag is better than another.

I have used my Wiggy bag for over 14 years now. I bought it for kayak camping because of it&apos;s reputed insulating qualities when wet. It&apos;s a 20F bag and it does fine as that. There have been no quality issues, indeed, it appears to have been well made and has served me well up to now. Being in the 99th percentile of stature I had the bag, when I ordered it, made larger than stock. This turned out to be a good decision.

I find the bag a bit on the heavier/bulkier side but for it&apos;s intended application - kayak camping - it is well suited.

For colder weather or back packing I have an older &quot;Fairy Down&quot; bag. It has been my experience that down cannot be beat for weight or when one is out in colder weather. I base my expressed viewpoint on personal experience over the last 30 years having used my down bag down to as cold as -40F all over Northern BC and Alberta in late fall and winter. Posted by: AKJD 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/07/08 08:24 AM 
 Map,

I don&apos;t have any experience with the Wiggys bags but do have a little experience hunting in Alaska. I used a North Face Cats Meow rated at 20 degrees last year and it did me well. I used it for a Sept moose hunt in the interior and an Oct Goat hunt on Kodiak. The weather was warm in Sept and we were above snow line in Oct. I was comfortable in the bag on both hunts. I am a cold sleeper, if I get a little chilled I put my base layer on in the bag. That time of year I don&apos;t think a zero degree bag is absolutely necessary but I guess you can&apos;t go wrong going with your outfitters recommendation. I didn&apos;t see if you mentioned what time of year or where you are hunting, that may have some bearing on your decision for a bag. I don&apos;t think a 0 Degree bag is necessary for an early Aug sheep hunt, but thats just my opinion. My last 3 bags have all been North Face rated in the 10-20 range and have served me well. I think if you get a quality synthetic bag that is well made in the 0-20 range you will be OK. Bags seem to bring out a lot of emotions in folks, i guess because its such an intimate piece of equipment, so ultimately only you can decide whats best for you. Contact some suppliers, see what their return policy is, order a few and try them out for fit and function. Find the one you like return the rest and don&apos;t look back. Oh yeah, take a book for those days you don&apos;t get out of your bag.

 map, you were warned by Marc with the first reply pretty politely what a Wiggy&apos;s post would result in. I gave you my personal experience with Wiggy&apos;s bags (nothing about the owner or personalities mind you) in a PM just to avoid being a catalyst to this sort of thing. I repeat that it&apos;s amazing that it went this long without explosion. At a certain point you just have to realize that the &quot;replies&quot; are not to you. I think Hampstead summed things up pretty well and all the advice about this being a personal choice are spot on. You&apos;ve been given sound advice, it&apos;s up to you to educate yourself further and make your own decision. It is unfortunate that you have no opportunity to try bags on personally although given the hunt you plan to go on, I&apos;d suggest that even a fairly long drive will be worth it to find the bag that is right to you. As to the down thing, you didn&apos;t mention interest in down until page 20 something and had specified synthetic from the start. I haven&apos;t hunted Alaska but there are a lot of guys here that not only do so but live there. I haven&apos;t taken a poll but at a cursory glance it would appear that synthetic is the way to go. For the record, I currently use a down bag but that is in relatively dry Colorado and love it. Contrary to some of the more strident synthetic lovers, I have not succumbed to the dangers of the wild by using one. Of course my bush plane has not crashed in a cold and raging wilderness river leaving me stranded with no fire and only my sleeping bag fishnet underwear as a means of survival. In that case, I&apos;d prefer synthetic. Good luck with your choice, but I just don&apos;t think anyone can be your personal shopper on this. I hope your other thread gives you the answers you need but a search might find you more. Posted by: AkMtnHntr 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/07/08 08:54 AM 
 Lets see if we can clear this thing up a little. If your looking for a super lightweight synthetic sleeping bag for backpacking then you might want to consider another brand. If your looking for a sleeping bag to use on hunts where your NOT backpacking then seriously consider the Wiggy&apos;s. Now with that being said, Wiggy&apos;s did make a lighter bag for the backpacking hunter, it&apos;s called the Glacier Hunter bag and is sold only through Taylors store. Myself, I don&apos;t need a 2.5 - 3 lb bag, I am more than happy to carry that extra 1 lb knowing I will be warm as toast at the end of the day. Most of these guys know a lot about backpacking gear and offer very good advice but some of them have a hard on for Wiggys because of what happened on the Kifaru site, so be it, it&apos;s over and done with. Listen to what kute, Ed T, Taylor, and Hampstead have to say, they offer some very sound advice. Good luck in your search!! Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/07/08 10:36 AM 
 map, to second what AkMtnHntr just said, and AKJD, dude your going a spring bear hunt in May. I dont see you moving camp on your back all too often. May can generally have much nicer weather than fall but its still Alaska so anything can happen. I am unclear if you are doing a guided hunt or a hunt with friends based on the info you have provided. That missing info would help make your decision for you, but if your hunting the way I think you probably will be, I&apos;d grab up a big warm synthetic bag that wont break the bank and call her good. I dont see your needing a down bag nor a light one, but like I said it would sure help if we knew what type of camp (tent,boat,cabin?) your expecting. The Wiggys Superlight (0 degree) bag I recently got from Marc though not lightweight by backpacking standards is a cozy SOB, it s big and comfy, hell I almost took a nap in it when I layed in it messing with my new tent. And to be honest with you they are fairly inexpensive by sleeping bag standards. Theres a fine line between lightweight gear that works and just plain gear that works and generally speaking when you add lightweight to the equation it changes the definition of comfort to some degree.I too have been using a Cats Meow or a similar NF equivalent for a lot of years and it has worked well for a sub 3 lb backpacking bag thats synthetic. Just pick one and roll dude, or at least tell us a little more about the hunt your doing. Posted by: AkMtnHntr

 C&apos;mon. map instigated this whole thing from minute one. He could have searched enough to know better. He stated that he knew, in advance, that this subject was volatile.

Now he&apos;s sitting in front of his laptop with a box of tissues &apos;cause a certain number of posters didn&apos;t tell him what he initially wanted to hear.

Nevertheless, he&apos;s contributed nothing, selected an awefully ill subject with which to introduce himself, failed to perform even a little diligence prior to raising this issue, and proceeds to post snide, snarky, little rebutles to all who failed to assure him.

 Further, I&apos;m not sure what to make of all these &quot;allusions&quot; to this thread going &quot;downhill&quot;.

Quite simply, (when it apparantly got heavy for some), I suggested Marc support his big Customer service policy on the same thread he is allowed to propogate all the other aspects of his products&apos; virtues.

He chose to decline and berate. To that point, I was rather congenial and willing to negotiate his firm&apos;s virtues.

The guys that suggest this thread went &quot;downhill&quot; because someone stood up to Taylor&apos;s suggestions, should consider paying for their very own wiggy-only mb.

I was polite, made an offer commensurate with the espoused guarantee that the gear salesman rides on, and received the exact attitude that anyone can expect.

 I&apos;m not here to place judgement on anyone&apos;s intentions. If they say they&apos;re looking for answers, then that&apos;s what I&apos;ll assume they&apos;re after until I read proof to the contrary. The first few pages of this thread were OK, and had some good honest feedback by guys with bag experience. If the thread had died there, it would have been perfectly fine, AND the first time a Wiggys thread ended well.

I realize as much as ANYONE how hard it is to post a comment and make it sound like I&apos;d want it to in a FTF conversation, so I keep that in mind when reading the posts of others. This backpacking section is my favorite part of the Campfire, and I&apos;d prefer to see the pissing matches contained to the political section of this site-----------although I still don&apos;t see their place on an outdoor forum either, but I digress......

 Chawn, GOOD NEWS my little tummy quit aching and I got all
the tears wiped from my eyes. And I have a question for you.

1. Do you own or have you ever owned a wiggy&apos;s sleeping bag?

If you have state why you do or don&apos;t like it.

Now I know I am new to this forum, but however I had no ideal
that the subject of this post would cause so much turmoil.

On the first page of this post someone posted what a can-o-worms
I have opened, and I believe it was Mark Taylor but I am not sure.

You have not offended me until the last 3 or 4 pages. I hope I haven&apos;t offended you. But you act like I have said something out of line, now if I have I would like to know what I said. Now all the info posted was useful to a certain extent I just could have done without all the name calling. Now if Wiggy&apos;s truely does not stand behind their product I would not be interested in doing any buisness with them or support any of their products. Please reply and speak freely I am asking for it.

thanks

I was in the store in Anchorage when a guy brought, what appeared to be a new bag(Wiggy&quot;s)back as he was dissatisfied with the loft after washing.....Marc chatted w/the customer, who was less than polite, and the gent walked out of the store with a new bag, no charge, and a smile on his face.

I&apos;ve got no dog in this fight...from my limited time around him, he appears to be more than fair...I&apos;m gonna try a Wiggy&apos;s bag after I get over my present interest in quilts........my present quilt(kind of a bag)is synthetic, weighs 19oz and is good down to
35* or so.......all of my backpacking bags are down bags......I&apos;ve never seen a goose hypothermic from getting his down wet,&amp;that&apos;s good enough for me:~) I&apos;ve been using down safely since 1962......

 I&apos;m not sure if you were being serious, CCH, about the popularity of Wiggy&apos;s bags. As noted before, I think Coleman probably sells more sleeping bags than anyone else on the planet. If memory serves, when this thread began I took a look at the D&amp;B;data for Wiggy&apos;s. If I recall correctly, the company had less than $2.5 million in annual revenues in 2006. That&apos;s a pretty tiny business. This said, I suspect a number of the &quot;boutique&quot; manufacturers don&apos;t have huge annual sales numbers. High-end sleeping bags are a niche market... and frankly, I think that when niche companies get big, quality often suffers.

Perhaps the most salient question is, &quot;When the &apos;experts&apos; like world-class mountaineers pick a sleeping bag, what do they choose&quot;? If you go to a K2, what do you see in the tents? Now, I understand the specific demands for mountaineering at that elevation are different than hunting in a lower and much wetter environment. Still, when a guy has to put his life on the line, he&apos;s going to pick the bag that works best... not the bag where he got the best deal or the one he&apos;s trying to sell. Posted by: AkMtnHntr

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/10/08 09:39 AM 
 Well, up to a point, let&apos;s not forget that expeditions of that sort are always sponsored and thus the participants tend to use the gear GIVEN to them by the big makers. They ALSO usually just give the gear to the Sherpas after a major effort on a major peak and thus are not as concerned with longevity and costs as WE might well be.

So, I do not really consider them a dependable source for advice/example in THIS situation, our needs are different and our abilities to obtain gear are, as well.

I DO agree that as the &quot;boutique&quot; makers grow, their quality USUALLY declines, however, WM and ID bags have IMPROVED since the earlier models I saw and Valandre has to be used to see just how good a bag can be. As to production level bags, I would look at the new Kifaru Slick bags before any other one out there and IF the 0*F model actually DOES work at that temp. and at 2.75 lbs. for this level of comfort in cold, THAT is a helluva breakthrough!

My experience with Patrick Smith is that he is a gentleman of the first order and I would expect this bag to be &quot;cutting edge&quot; and a superb choice for hunters. Posted by: ironbender

 I know the Sportsmans Whorehouse in Anchorage has some Wiggy bags but the salespeople are so lacking in knowledge about them that they may never sell, unless they discount them just to get rid of them. I remember seeing 1 model of the Wiggys bag on the Cabelas sight but that was a long while ago. Posted by: Hampstead

 I would call my question semi-rhetorical... I don&apos;t consort with many world class climbers but those I have known like down and tend to sleep in Mountain Hardwear, Western Mountaineering or Marmot. Of course, this might reflect a bit of American bias.

I&apos;m going to respectfully disagree with Kute on a few points. While many climbs have sponsors, most climbers will not put themselves at risk for the sake of an endorsement. Most guys will use gear they know works for them... and like most other groups, climbers can be a bit superstitious. Of course, most of the gear companies interested in sponsoring an expedition are doing so to market pretty high end equipment. I doubt you&apos;ll see &quot;Coleman&quot; underwriting a K2 expedition anytime soon. Besides, the gear is really a de minimus cost of an expedition. I&apos;d guess a serious attempt at a peak like K2 will run a quarter of a million by the time you have paid for travel, put a support team in place and paid all of the &quot;freight.&quot; What an expedition needs is cash, luck, and good weather. In short, it&apos;s a bit like hunting. Posted by: Glacier_John

 Following up on Hampstead, back in 1962 when Dyhrenfurth was putting together the first American Everest attempt, a big part was getting sponsers to donate equipment and or money in exchange for publicity. Dick Kelty was too small to be able to afford donating packs so the official pack of the American Everest Expedition was Camp Trails. Unofficially a lot of the guys bought special expedition packs from Kelty. I know Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld had input into Dick&apos;s design of the new pack which was in production for many years after that, it was called the Kelty BB5.

I think Jim Whittaker carried the official Camp Trials pack but I&apos;m pretty sure Tom, Willi, Lute Jerstad and Bishop carried the Kelty BB-5. There may have been others as well. Posted by: CCH

 Sorry, should have used suitable smilies. Take most any of my comments re: Wiggy&apos;s bags tongue in cheek. See my other thread (please) for evidence. I was kind of wondering how anyone knows the details of someone else&apos;s sleeping bag purchases? Is there some sort of monitor on our computers that I don&apos;t know about. For the record, I had several Wiggy&apos;s all purchased from Grand Junction. Still have the ones for the kids.

 Here&apos;s what I got in my own email today: 

 Chawn,

According to my records which go back 22 years you show up on the mailing list but do not show up as purchasing anything.

You claim to own I believe I read 3 bags. Where did you get them and when?

You did not get them from Wiggys directly other wise we would have a record.

Answer map truthfully.

He is on the Wiggy&apos;s mail list but our records do not show him ever buying
from us.
I would really question him.

Tell CCH that Cabelas sold Wiggy&apos;s bags for 6 years and I ended the sales
for business reasons that were beneficial to Wiggy&apos;s.

Tell ken999 that he never got the bags from me.

Tell Hampstead that Coleman does not make any bags. The figures I give D&amp;B;
are what I chose to give them. And I do produce more +$100.00 Bags Than any
other company in the world.

Tell kutenay that I encourage him and everyone else to buy the slick as
_____ bags. Then he can tell us about them.

One last item, tell kutenay when the original owner of ID a fellow named
Brian from South Africa was still the owner he was lic. To make LAMILITE
bags. When the company changed hands to another brian from adventure tech
took over he switched Primaloft because they GAVE him $15,000.00 in
advertising money. Recently the current ownership of ID called him asking if
he would buy the company back. He refused because there is a VERY limited
market for their products.

 I thought about purchasing a Wiggy&apos;s bag last Fall.
Then I took a closer look at their website and noticed the tone of some of the Wiggy&apos;s fan club on this site and decided to buy a Western Mountaineering bag instead.

I have no regrets, and this thread just serves to reinforce that fact. Posted by: AkMtnHntr

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 10:08 AM 
 If Mr. Wigutow wants to talk directly with people, I suggest using the forum PM system (although I&apos;m not particularly keen on a conversation with him). I&apos;m sure his attorney(s) and his accountant(s) would appreciate any further statements about providing the financial data &quot;he chooses&quot; to D&amp;B;be made in a more private setting. As to Coleman not making sleeping bags, don&apos;t tell Wal-Mart , the world&apos;s largest retailer. And yes, I know the sub-$100 Coleman bags are all made offshore in some nondescript factory where they get the label. This is why I made the point earlier in this thread that popularity and sales do not indicate quality.

As for sales data on over-$100 bags, call me a skeptic but I would need to see data from an independent source. The boast of a company president and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee downtown. Personally, I find it pretty difficult to think of Wiggy&apos;s as the world leader when other brands have such a strong presence with major outdoor retailers. At the end of the day, it really doesn&apos;t matter to me. I can only sleep in a bag that is certified 100-percent drama free. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming. Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 10:19 AM 
 FWIW I know you guys dont like this fella fom Wigys but I got to tell you guys something. Theres a whole bunch of Alaskan hunters using Wiggys bags in the worst places you can go in this state, and they swear by them. I dont know anything about car camping but the guys that are using them are in places like the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak where the weather is the worst imaginable anywhere and will make the most remote lower 48 hunt (including Montana) look like car camping. Remote hunts in western Alaska where once again bad weather would be bordering on a category 3 Hurricane in the southern US. So if you want to trash Marc T or Jerry from Wiggys thats fine, but to say that their bags dont work or are no good well, I can think of some pretty hard core Alaskan hunters that would debate that with a vengance. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 10:27 AM 
 Really...guys from the lower 48 are not qualified to make judgement calls on gear because we are not &apos;remote&apos; enough?

Something to remember...being flown it, boated in, or getting things hauled in on sleds does not qualify for &apos;backpacking&apos;, hence some fellas beef with Wiggy&apos;s. It&apos;s not the lightest or tightest packing...plain and simple. Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 10:45 AM 
 ken


My point is that if a guy were to get on this forum and read some of you guys post based on hatred for Marc T and Jerry they would think that Wiggys bags dont work. Are they the lightest bags made? No! But if a guy wants to carry a 3 lb bag that just plain works for him as opposed to a 2 lb down bag that he has no interest in thats his perogative. I am not defending the Wiggys bags, I have never even used one, but I can tell you that I have more than one story of friends having $700+ tents blown off mountains or shredded in 90mph+ sideways rain and wind and were forced to sleep under a tarp in their bags in that weather and survived. So I am not saying that lower 48 backpacking is for [bleep] I am just saying that your likelihood of experiencing what many happy Wiggys bag users see here every season is not likely and for you to say they dont work based on your experience in your geographical location with the conditions you experince doesn&apos;t hold much water.

By the way ken what does ADK stand for in your location? Posted by: AkMtnHntr

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 11:22 AM 
 I know from decades of personal experience in B.C., the YT, the N.W.T. and a bit in AK, that the weather HERE is every bit as harsh as anywhere in Alaska and the YT and NWT are FAR more remote. So, while I see the point, I would suggest that AK is not the only region where life-sustaining gear quality is an issue of crucial importance.

I think that there is a very sound basis to Ken&apos;s point AND we ALL have to remember, me included, that it is EASY to become hypothermic in most of North America and upstate New York, Yellowstone and various other places can also kill you deader than hell, REAL FAST, if your gear allows you to get hypothermic.

I worked in forestry in southern Ontario many years ago, briefly, the weather is VERY much like where I grew up and equivalent to New York, with &quot;lake effect&quot;snow and it get&apos;s COLD there, well into April. So, we ALL need quality gear, not just Alaskan &quot;cheechakos&quot; or even &quot;sourdoughs&quot;. Posted by: AkMtnHntr 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 11:36 AM 
 I don&apos;t think he was stating that Alaska is the end all be all of harsh climates for backpacking/camping kute, he was just stating what he&apos;s seen up here and frankly, I&apos;ve seen it as well, thats all we&apos;re saying, not bragging or putting Alaska ahead of anyone else. I&apos;ve seen the sales up here firsthand, everyone from guides to bush pilots to slope workers to villagers buy these things. It&apos;s a darn good bag that works, the problem I see is people getting past JW and is what brings on threads like this. Posted by: Hampstead 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 01:07 PM 
 Maybe I have missed something, but I don&apos;t recall anyone saying Wiggy&apos;s makes a terrible bag. At the risking of invoking someone&apos;s wrath I will say again what I have said before. The majority opinion seems to be that Wiggy&apos;s is a competent synthetic sleeping bag that is on the heavy side.

I have never met Mark Taylor or Jerry Wigutow. Taylor strikes me as a salesman... and I don&apos;t find sales clerks the most congenial of company. Wigutow seems like a blowhard, but that&apos;s not entirely uncommon with guys who have small... companies. (In the words of Foghorn Leghorn, &quot;It&apos;s a joke, son.&quot;)

If there are folks in Alaska happy in Wiggy&apos;s bags, God bless &apos;em. I&apos;m not here to tell anyone what to buy or not buy. I&apos;m just here to share my experiences and (mostly) learn from others. As long as the discussion is civil and informative, I don&apos;t mind participating. I think when there are folks with a financial or emotional stake in a product, the conversation can go downhill.

As for Alaska, I agree with Kute. I&apos;ve traveled a bit. One of the coldest places I can remember is Korea when the wind came right down out of Siberia. Up north of the Artic Circle can get brisk. The rain on the BC coast can come in horizontally for days at a stretch. I spent a week in a tent where the high temperature was zero (F) and the wind was consistently 20 mph. Kute is spot on. The weather that kills you is the weather that sneaks up on you. After a guy has been in some hard country, it&apos;s easy to let your guard down... and that&apos;s when Mr. Murphy shows up. Posted by: AlaskaCub 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 01:45 PM 
 I agree with you guys no doubt, and I wans&apos;t/am not trying to start a pissing contest in defense of Wiggys bags, like I said I have never used one. All I am saying is that by all the pissing matches that go on here a new guy looking for a good synth hunting bag would be turned off from a Wiggys and misled into believing that it shouldn&apos;t even be considered. I have obviously found other bags that have worked well for me but that doesn&apos;t mean that the Wiggys doesn&apos;t equal or exceed the quality of bags that I have used. As to the regional comments well like AkMtnHntr stated I am not putting us on a higher level of know how than guys from other regions. But I have been to those other regions and have never experienced what I can bet money on that I will experience up here each year. I mean chit I have been in a tent on trips several times with 70+mph winds outside and rain sideways where I am just sure the whole house is coming down and to be over 100 air miles from the nearest road or help of any type it makes a guy think a little bit and I have to admit that I have never experienced that in the western states I have been in and I am not saying I have experienced it once up here, but several times. So with that said the guys that I know that head out into this remote chit and experience that chit and rely on Wiggys bags for that chit, do so for a reason. They are also the buds that I ask why they dont get a lihter bag and they look at me and say you get what you want no matter the weight, I am using my Wiggys. Posted by: Fishkilla 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 02:27 PM 
 Im three years into a Mtn hunter and have never regreted the purchase. Wasnt aware of Wigutows rep when I bought it but could care less. IF I have a problem with my bag im sure it will be taken care of. That said, the bag performs flawlessly, I spend 30 or more days (not as many as i&apos;d like and certainly not as many as others)in this setup on various fishing and hunting trips via raft, plane AND on foot each year. It is probably not the #1 choice for most backpack hunters but it is a great bag regardless and one could do much worse. I have crawled into this setup dripping wet clothed and come out dry in the morning. That is my experience in a Wiggy&apos;s bag, I hope my low post count doesn&apos;t render it null and void. Good luck Posted by: Hampstead

 I think if a guy reads this thread and ignores the little jibs and jabs, he can come away with more good information on sleeping bags than he can in most outdoor gear shops. Perhaps the best lesson is that the manufacturer is just one aspect of the decision. A guy has to find a bag that works for him and I daresay there&apos;s not a single bag that works well for everyone. Posted by: ironbender

 Yup, I have been in conditions exactly like those AC and AKMH mention here in B.C. on a number of occasions and often alone. This is WHY I am so insistent upon certain aspects of gear and technique as even in the relatively warm conditions of coastal Alaska and B.C., the 100mph winds on the Charlottes can drive that heavy rain right through your tent fly and floor.

I had my North Face VE just drenching in a severe spring storm four years ago, the tent was next to useless and later I found that gusts to 75mph had torn signs off the buildings in the small Kootenay town below the mountains I was camped in. I had seen this coming and re-inforced everything plus had a backup camp. so, for my 4 days-nights, I was just fine and my custom ID down-Endurance bag never let in a droplet.

This type of storm is common in B.C. mountains and other places as well, but, the distances and remoteness of AK, BC and certain other regions makes it a little freakier as you KNOW that NOBODY can help you in case of trouble. What to do? Use Hilleberg tents and whatever bag YOU find best, Wiggy&apos;s, WM, ID or that new Slick from Kifaru.....that is ONE NEAT RIG, no matter what JW implies. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 05:07 PM 
 AC- For the record, my Wiggy&apos;s works at spec&apos;d temps. For $180 and 3 lbs, I can&apos;t say I made a bad purchase. I like it.

&quot;I am just saying that your likelihood of experiencing what many happy Wiggys bag users see here every season is not likely and for you to say they dont work based on your experience in your geographical location with the conditions you experince doesn&apos;t hold much water.&quot;

That statement is almost as rediculous as your post before it. I&apos;m not even sure how to argue with such nonsense. I&apos;m pretty sure our rain here in the Adirondacks is as wet as it is anywhere else in the world. Now if you wanted to lay a claim to the fact that we don&apos;t see temps much under -35f, so anyone from here wouldn&apos;t be as much of an authority on extreme winter camping, than I&apos;d certainly have to conceede to a certain extent (there are some users here that hike the Whites in winter and they deal in pretty extreme winter conditions). With regards this argument though, your cold AND wet isn&apos;t really all that different than our cold AND wet.

AKMH- Just what is this THING that I&apos;m supposed to accept? Clue me in.

I agree that not every bag is for every user. The trick is knowing you and your bags limitations, then doing you best to keep things in your favour while afeild. THAT doesn&apos;t change regardless of locale. Posted by: RaceTire

 Kute,
This thread is pretty entertaining. Years ago a wise old guy told me any time someone is talking about you whether it&apos;s good or it&apos;s bad they are still talking and any publicity is good publicity. Not sure he (the old wise man) was right in some cases but reading how Wiggy has been with some people and about his reputation and seeing 37 pages of posts IMO he&apos;s sure getting the publicity and it&apos;s free.
I&apos;ve talked to the man twice and emailed him once. He was OK and his communication skills were OK and his product knowledge was good. He was awful proud of the product he makes and from what I have experienced it is deserved.
FWIW I was in a Kifaru Tipi on a Muley hunt (no liner) and it snowed and rained for two days at 9000 ft in CO. My Wiggy bag kept me warm and dry (the tipi was sweating pretty good) and my buddies Browning Down Bag was cold and wet.
Also, if JW had insulted me or made me feel like a dummy when I talked to him about his bags I wouldn&apos;t have spent any money. I must have been one of the lucky ones to have been treated right.

 I have thought for quite some time that the cagey old baztard ( he is about 3 yrs. older than I) does all this quite deliberately for that very reason.

I think that you HAVE to use a liner in the K-tipis or stay inside stoking the stove to keep it dry constantly. I wouldn&apos;t have a rig like that without a liner, that&apos;s one reason I hated my old Chouinard Pyramid so much, dripped constantly...but, it did work and was light, for it&apos;s time.

 Kute,
He has a style (some like it and some don&apos;t) but it&apos;s his style and I think you have hit the nail directly on the head. It would cost a lot of money to get as much publicity as JW gets free on the backpacking forums.
Great advice on the tipi. Patrick&apos;s sales lady told me she didn&apos;t think I needed the liner when I bought the tipi but it was definitley needed. From your experience do the liners control the drips (I still haven&apos;t bought one)well enough to keep the tipi dry and it appears that it simply is an inner liner with space between it and the outside fabric and as long as it doesn&apos;t lay on the outer liner it will be dry. Is my analysis pretty close??

Thanks,

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 05:40 PM 
 The thing is, at -35, a 0-degree anything is going to likely fail. If going apples to apples, a guy with a WM Bison dryloft, is just as likely to do fine as one with an Ultima Thule, etc.

This whole notion about crawling in the bag wet and near death is too much theory for those that continue to reference it.

Put a baselayer and a micropuff kit in a silnylon or drybag and you&apos;ll go to bed far drier everytime. If a guy is wearing clothing that will not dry quickly during the next day&apos;s exertion, he&apos;s probably not wearing very good EQ for those conditions.

Who the heck goes to their bag at night fully clothed and soaking wet???

Fwiw, (and I realize that&apos;s very little) my moonstone synthetic performs similarly during wet conditions.

I remember a trip I went on a couple years ago. In Redfield, there was nearly 40&quot; of snowfall from a single storm. The following day, temps went to 65-70 degrees and stayed there for 2 days. There was so much snow collection on the trees that it was like a rainforest. Add that everywhere around you was flooding from the snowmelt on the ground. To hunt that, there was no escaping rain, drip, flood, etc.
This was lowland territory to begin with. The nights dropped to between 13 and 20 degrees each time. That was cold and wet. It sucked. It wasn&apos;t fun.

I got through it with a down bag which never wetted out. Not making a case for down over syn., just saying that it would have sucked regardless of bag configuration, but good gear and good choices make the difference, sometimes.

NY has enough junky weather to challenge anyone&apos;s common sense and eq. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 05:48 PM 
 Dave- You are correct. I don&apos;t have one for my 8-man, but a buddy of mine has one for his 12. The condensation happens where the warm air meets the cold on the tipi wall. The liner stays off the walls and catches the drips, directing them to the outer edge of the tipi. It is VERY effective and a worthy addition to the tipi should you find the drips too annoying.

I spent two nights with 5 guys in my buddies with temps right around the freezing mark and lot&apos;s of humidity...the liner worked perfectly. Posted by: RaceTire 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 05:55 PM 
 Ken,
Thanks for sharing your experience. I am going to call tomorrow and order a liner for my 4 man. I like the tipi (except for the drips) and it sure is light. Hope I can get out and use it this coming fall.

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 06:50 PM 
 I guess I should have made clear the particulars of the specific trip where I crawled into the sack clothed and wet. Training run for a &apos;06 sheep hunt out my folks back door into the Chugach in a good rain, was to be an overnight trip so I knew I&apos;d be coming back the next day. Arrived at my ridge that evening wet, after busting brush for a few miles before breaking out above it. Pitched camp, ate dinner, shed my rain gear and got in with my midweight long bottoms under convertable pants with patty long sleeve regulator dripping. Figured this was as good a time as any to see if the bag would do what I was told it would. Woke up several hours later, opened the drawstring and let the steam bellow out, back to sleep. Next morning to my suprise I have to admit I was dry. Never said it was a near death experience or that my life depended on the function of the bag that night, but figured what the hell, better to find out now rather then when I might actually need it to. Hope that helps.

Im fully confident in my kit btw but thanks for the suggestions regerding baselayers and micro puff which im a firm beleiver in. Posted by: AlaskaCub

Geez guy, all I am saying is that I have spent a significant amount of time in mountainous regions of the lower 48 and its more of a prayers hell to experience what we experience quite frequently in certain areas of our state. For instance I asked you what ADK stood for, and I was correct in thinking the Adirondacks. I have climbed all the big mountains of the Adirondacks, Mt. Marcy probably a dozen or so times. I was a pioneering instructor for a summer camp in up state NY.I literally spent about 60 days a year sleeping in a tent or a lean-to in upstate NY. I also floated and canoed most of the big lakes and rivers of upstate NY and I can tell you first hand that NY never through anything at me like Alaska does at least once annually. So with that said, I was stating that what many guys endure happily with Wiggys bags, which often is beyond miserable, they do so with some sort of comfort and attribute it to their Wiggys bag. Can it be done with other bags? Like I said earlier....yes. But some tend to get off track on these threads and end up bashing an otherwise optimal option for a piece of gear because of personal feelings. I really dont have a dog in this fight and wasnt picking one. Just expressing my opinion and knowledge of the product. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 07:01 PM 
 That&apos;s the same reason why I have stuck with synthetics despite there being some dandy down bags around...I want to be able to jump in mine wet if need be and wake up dry(er) in the AM. So far, I&apos;m not willing to give up the security synthetic affords to gain the little bit of space/weight savings that some down bags offer.

Some guys pull it off...I&apos;m just not ready to try quite yet. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 07:10 PM 
 Sounds to me like the biggest variable between AK and ADK is the wind. That makes it more of a tent/shelter issue than it does a sleeping bag issue. Rain and wet is all the same...here or there. I&apos;m sure that there are places in AK that get way more of the rain and wet, but none the less, it&apos;s still just rain and wet, no?

EDIT- And NO...your argument that some guys are bashing because of personal feelings, combined with the fact that they are from a &apos;lesser&apos; locale, their opinions should not count, hold water, blah blah blah....

 Yup and there are some places where its not so bad, but theres the Murphy theory and up here you always have to plan for it. I can tell you that theres places I am willing to give down a try and I am gonna this year for the first time. But theres places I am not ready to give down a try just yet. I sure do like the idea of a sub 2 lb 15 degree bag though, and have a couple of them in the garage right now. Posted by: Fishkilla 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 07:19 PM 
 Right now, I feel the same. Not only do I use the bag backpacking but on float trips and flyouts too. If for whatever reason the [bleep] were to hit the fan, be it a fall during creek crossings, bear tearing down camp while away, flipped boat or an unsucessful plane landing in the bush/on a lake. All of which highly unlikely but possible. Im just confident in this setup for my needs at this point, and it works. Posted by: AlaskaCub

This is true, but ask Marc T what he had to deal with when he came down from hunting sheep all day this past season and his tent had been destroyed by a curious grizzly bear, and he was many air miles from help. Chit that can phuck up your plans happens a lot up here, and its those incidents that build strong opinions about gear as well as building a bit of character. A guy I know had a nightamrish experience while hunting goats in the late season on Kodiak this past fall, where his Kifaru Tipi blew the phuck down in 90+ mph winds and they had to roll up in the tipi and attempt to sleep through the 10 hour storm. Wet, cold and miserable, he&apos;ll tell you that the Wiggys just plain worked. I am not dogging you dude, I am just saying that many Alaskan hunters endure some crazy chit every year using them bags and they dont come back saying I need a new sleeping bag. Posted by: ken999 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 07:44 PM 
 Fish- I agree 100%...6 or so years ago when I finally started getting more seriuos about packing I researched the heck outta bags. Then I camped with a co-worker on a fishing trip who was using a NF down bag rated to -20 or something...the bag wasn&apos;t too big packed up and, despite the overkill of it all, it made total sense to me as he slept like a baby while I froze my azz off. So...I looked into the NF bags when we got back and dontcha know they advertised the Darkstar (-40) as their most popular bag in wet Alaska???. After looking over the spec&apos;s and comparing it to all other synthetic I could read about, I couldn&apos;t order one fast enough. I figured what the hell, it&apos;s only 5.5 lbs...gotta be warm as hell...it was, still is...

My point being, I feared no weather with that bag...I was comfortable in my decision...after using it a bit I was totally confident that I could pretty much handle anything short of Siberian winter...lol...I&apos;ve settled down a bit now, and find that I can get away with ALOT lighter and smaller packing bags these days...but I still will not go afeild with something that I have reservations about.

But god forbid someone from the placid tranquil lower 48 has a bad experience with their Wiggys and talks about it online...certainly they are wrong and their experience/opinion cannot hold water. I guess it&apos;s move to Ak, toughen up, then speak from true wilderness experience.

 AC, you don&apos;t sound like you ever climbed Marcy in the winter. I&apos;ve been on top in winds right at the 80 mph mark and have been out in weather many nights that were sub zero there. Only time I ever got the start of hypothermia was on top of Mt Washington, NH in an August snowstorm. I&apos;ve also been in the AK bush. Truth of the matter is severe weather can kill you anywhere, anytime and I assure you AK doesn&apos;t have a corner on the market as you&apos;d find out if you ever spent any time in the Montana backcountry.

Mostly I found the people that bought Wiggy&apos;s bags from our shop here in Bozeman were &quot;hunting/survivalist/para-military&quot; types that really weren&apos;t clued in to the climbing/backpacking world and were just making a step up from Cabela&apos;s.

The bags work well enough, no doubt. We sold boatloads of em... as I said however, there are so many solid and better choices out there why would you want to support a guy that acts like this?

 I own a down bag and somehow survived. Those that have seen it can attest to the loft. Oh sure I only hunt and camp in the seemingly topical lower 48. Anything above or below room temperature scares me. I am working up to the mid 50&apos;s and one day with luck I will get the courage to attempt 40&apos;s. But seriously who really cares what bag someone uses. I need a better synthetic bag but want the lightest one possible that has enough room for my fat backside. The cat&apos;s meow is a fantastic bag for the temp rating but need a zero bag. Still I like the cat&apos;s meow. Posted by: Leadslinger

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/11/08 09:33 PM 
 Without getting into the AK versus Lower 48 debate, I think this debate really belongs in the Alaska section as most of the arguments for needing a Wiggys bag seem to be more related to camping in an Alaskan situation where the weight of the bag is less of a factor due to transportation by bush plane, float plane, boat, canoe and maybe by backpack. I have a heavy 12# large rectangular Eddie Bauer down bag, supposedly good to -40 for those times when I don&apos;t care about weight.

Light weight and compactness are a much bigger issue with backpacker-mountaineers. I lived in Fairbanks for four years after my Yukon River trip and did a lot of wilderness camping, mostly by canoe. Mostly in interior Alaska where extreme cold is a greater factor. It seems to me that the combination of slightly above freezing rain and high wind is a very specialized segment of adverse conditions and is the one situation where a synthetic bag is probably more appropriate.

I had never heard of Wiggys before this thread so I can&apos;t offer any opinion on whither his is the best Synthetic bag, but it seems like those that need that kind of bag are able to look past his questionable personality and just appreciate the bags he makes. But based on those emails Brad posted he seems like a border line jerk to me and I would look at other synthetic bags first, but if there wasn&apos;t anything as good, I might hold my nose and buy one of his, if he&apos;d let me.

 Most of the people that are complaining about the tone of this thread, simply complain about the &quot;tone&quot;. I&apos;ve been berated enough because of it. It also seems as though most of the people who hate the tone, don&apos;t seem to have had the whole history of this issue behind them.

Nonetheless, all I&apos;ve tried to do was explain, specifically, what the shortcomings of this gear is as I experienced and why alternatives have not been the failures that all the fear mongering suggests.

Entirely lost on this crew, is the notion that a company owner (banned from this board) lurks through the posts here, then sends emails to individual posters accusing them of making false statements. I&apos;m pretty sure a $1400+ order would be pretty hard to lose.

You guys can accuse me of &quot;sitting at the kids table&quot;, but you don&apos;t want to acknowledge the goofy tactics that are used to push these bags, or the idea that someone can find faults in them.

I&apos;m done posting anything about these guys, their gear, or their tactics (clearly, to everyone&apos;s pleasure). It&apos;s plenty good with me that they are the new favorite flavor around here; guess it runs in cyles. Learned a lot about character, though. Posted by: kutenay 
Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/12/08 07:05 AM 
 I think that Glacier John and Brad have hit this nail right squarely and I also agree with Chawn. The situations I have seen with Wiggy and his antics have totally turned me off from ever buying anything from him and I find his obvious lurking on this and other boards where he has been banned, seems like most of them, to be indicative of the kind of jerk he usually is.

I think that the new Kifaru Slick bag, which a charming lady at Kifaru told me two days ago, will be shipping in about 2.5 months, is likely to be the new benchmark in synthetic bags. A 0*F bag that is warm and wet-proof while weighing only 2.75 lbs. is about perfect for hunters in ANY cold, wet environment, IMO and dealing with Kifaru is a pleasure, while JW, well......

With this Slick bag, one can make up a truely &quot;safe&quot; bivy camp at around 5 lbs. all in, if you choose your gear carefully. That is a hell of an improvement over what we had when I started this obsession and I am pleased that Patrick and Co. have brought it out.

 Kute, as to down vs. synthetic, I&apos;m one that has a foot frimly in both camps. My bag use over the years has been about 40/60 in favor of down. Both have their place. In cold/wet I still think synthetics are a smart choice but I&apos;ve never had an issue with a down bag other than loosing loft in very cold because of not using a VBL.

Years back I had a Snow Lion (remember them) Polarguard &quot;expedition&quot; bag... double layered, overlapping bats, double draft tubes, collar, etc. It was temp rated a -25F ... it was a VERY accurate temp rating .

I remember vividly one very clear night sleeping out under the stars in it. I had my trusty little thermometer (my favorite backpacking side-activity is checking temps) that registered -10F... I was stripped down to my skivvies in the bag and was still too warm!

My main gripes about synthetics are:

Narrower temp range
Weight
bulk
fill longevity

Re: WIGGY&apos;S SLEEPING BAG&apos;S - 03/12/08 07:36 AM 
 I agree, but, have mostly used down and never had any real trouble, except once by forgetting my bivy.

I remember SnowLion, I bought a Paul Petzoldt PG bag at that time and it worked very well under identical conditions in the Kootenays. But, it was a bear to stuff and carry in my Synergy pack and THEN I discovered the original Marmot and that was THAT.

At present, I have four topend down bags and will ALWAYS choose one as I find them more comfortable, my synthetics are only for my emerg. day hiking pack and hunting camps.

Each to his own, but, I doubt that any synthetic will ever quite match a WM, ID, Valandre or other really top end down bag....until the social engineers have found backpacking too dangerous and outlawed it, anyway! Posted by: Brad

LOL, yeah those warm PG bags were HEVAY and bulky! I never could fit it in my Synergy Works pack, even it a compression sack. It rode on top of my Jansport D3 

What a torture device the Synergy pack was, eh? 

Like you, I went with an early Marmot/Goretex shelled bag and never looked back.

 We have 5 systems already, had I a need for more, I&apos;d take you up on it, but trying to buy another down bag for my wife to use on backpacks in... the W are too bulky/heavy for that.

For arrival via anything other than foot I&apos;ll take my W every time thanks.

 AlaskaCub - The point being missed is that the panic button is a whole lot harder to press up here than below the 48th. How many times have we hunkered down because there will be no pick-up today or tomorrow or until this gale has run its course?

Then the bear comes in and destroys your camp...
Then the rain turns to sleet...
You could then maybe try to start a fire with your down bag to get some warmth.

There is no such thing as &quot;the&quot; Alaska bush. &quot;The Alaska bush&quot; varies in weather pattern, elevation and temperature about as much as the difference between the Carolinas, Missouri and Montana. Just as it would be pretty vague of me to say that I&apos;ve hunted in Montana before.

What&apos;s misunderstood is that you are always a day&apos;s walk or two at MAX from a road in the lower 48, and you can be a month&apos;s walk from a road in Alaska. Or, out west, get on the horse and head to the barn.

You can&apos;t just call it quits and head to the truck the way some of us hunt up here. Others up here take campers with them, on the other hand, depending on just how much of Alaska a person wants to experience at one time.

There are guides who will not take the client UNTIL he is in a Wiggy bag, so they keep them on hand. A miserable client will turn a miserable tip when his guide doesn&apos;t give up the Wiggy bag to him. I&apos;ve heard stories exactly like that.

On the other hand;

I&apos;ve had clients march a guide into this store to buy the guide a Wiggy bag AFTER the hunt in which they both slept, well actually only the client slept, in the rain on a mountain for a couple days.

Great to hear about your wealth of experience, AlaskaCub. It sounds like a rich bank account to draw on.

  Originally Posted By: AkMtnHntr It&apos;s the fact that there&apos;s a lot of people who like and use the Wiggy bags but some here cannot or won&apos;t accept that fact. Glad we have so many choices but it&apos;s to bad we can&apos;t discuss things without a pissing match interupting things. 

That&apos;s an amazing statement considering my whole disagreement with AC had absolutely NOTHING to do with the merits of a Wiggy bag. Methinks that alot of the problem is certain guys from AK cannot handle the fact that Wiggy bag(s) might not work for everyone, especially if it&apos;s one of us wussies down here in the lower 48 where the rain aint nowhere near as cold and wet as it is up there.

Personally I could care less what work for someone or what they have in there pack...I don&apos;t have to sleep in it. I&apos;ve got 3 synthetics, a NF, a Wiggys and a Kifaru. I like them all. Posted by: AkMtnHntr

From who? Wigutow? Who in the name of Hades are these guides? And these hunters? What kind of lower-than-whale-crap so-called hunter would even ASK to use another man&apos;s sleeping bag? What else does he want? The wife and the dog and all the cold beer? What kind of outfitter would put up with that nonsense for the sake of a &quot;tip&quot;? Are you telling me that some Alaska &quot;guide&quot; is going to look my ID bag and say, &quot;Hey, you&apos;re going to have to leave that piece of crap here because I don&apos;t want you getting wet and cold and whining for my Wiggy&apos;s bag and then I&apos;d have to give it you because it&apos;s so awesome and because I don&apos;t want you to stiff me on my tip.&quot; Is Alaska that big of a goat rope or are you just the Energizer Bunny of Wiggy sales? On second thought, Taylor, forget I asked. I&apos;ll just go back to the NWT where the Canadian guides bake good bread, brew a heckuva pot of tea and they treat hunters like hunters.

 Hampstead - If you think a guide requirement is anthing but hand-holding, to include the gear selection process, then you&apos;re delusional. And just look how many hunters would show up with their favorite Moonstone-Sunbeam-Lightweight-Just-Add-Water-and-CHILL down bag. To be assigned another hunter to point out your game and assist you in taking it, however, is required in some instances as we both know. Not much of a way around that.

Yep. &quot;Must own a Wiggy bag,&quot; says the guide. I don&apos;t give a flying fart whether you believe it or not, however. And it&apos;s the same kind of guide that has to hold the hand of a U.S. resident in Canada regardless of whether it&apos;s whitetails or polar bears that he&apos;s hunting. At least we draw a line in Alaska as to where the hand-holding begins, not require it of every hunter.

Come on, Chawn... We can&apos;t even take you at your word anymore that you won&apos;t be back to this thread? It&apos;s like sitting at the kids table and reaching over to touch the heater every once in a while to remind yourself that it&apos;s hot...

Brad.

Here is one of my Down bags.

 

What you are seeing there is not snow. Clearly that meteorological event only occurs in Alaska. It is actually the stuffing of a bean bag that was tossed from the sky. It is a little known fact that bears find humans wrapped in down to be ambrosia. Totally irresistible. A bit like bacon wrapped in peanut butter. Sleeping in down draws bears, werewolves, snow leopards, Siberian tigers and resurrected carnivores dinosaurs genetically modified from frog DNA into a camp from miles. 

The only reason why people survive using down on Everest is the altitude being prohibitive to all the above mentioned creatures. True the abominable snow man has been seen in the area of Everest but the word on street he is a camera shy vegetarian.

 Well here goes...
I know I should stay out of this but...
As a Native Oregonian I have lived,worked,hunted,fished in wet weather my whole existence. We can disagree as to who has the most extreme weather, but in reality who cares. When your wet and cold the certain zip code that you are in will not have a factor on whether hypothermia is gonna kill you.

When you talk about Everest and K2 your talking really cold yet dry conditions.
When you talk about Alaska in August, September or Western Oregon in October, November your talking really wet with high temps GENERALLY above freezing.
It makes it impossible to stay dry.

I have hunted blacktails and Roosevelt elk in late fall with temps in the high forties and constant rain.

I have hunted mulies and Rocky Mtn. elk in the more arid Eastern Oregon with temps in the single digits and snow, I can assure you it is far easier to stay warm in the more arid environment.

As to down vs. synthetic, I think a guy would be best suited to owning both! I know I do, and they both have their place and both get used.

Speakin of Kute if you would have listened to his advice on sleeping bags, this thread would be over now. That&apos;s OK though I wouldn&apos;t have had the pleasure of calling you a polesmoker. That&apos;s what you want isn&apos;t it? You started this thread and kept it going , knowing what you would get. By the way I&apos;m not hiding, all my stuff is on my profile.

Hunter of Wa.
Hunter of Co.
Hunter of Id.
Hunter of Montana
Hunter of Or.
Hunter of Tex.

That&apos;s more states than yours. Therefore I know more about hunting and sleeping bags than you

Its the classic debate. Peanut butter is more water resistant due to the oils however is heavier and packs down with greater bulk. Cotton candy is lighter and has greater loft but turns to a sugar syrup when wet. Posted by: bearstalker

You got me to counting; I stopped at 13 states. But that&apos;s not what makes a hunter. Contributes maybe, but that&apos;s about it.
There are plenty of ladies and gentlemen who have hunted all around the world and back but can be easily walked to death in a matter of hours and cant find their way out of &quot;City Park&quot;.
I salute the guy who never leaves his home state or province, but hunts just as hard as a person can.

You miss the point. mappy the fruit accused me of hiding, and having no expierence. Well I&apos;m not hiding, and I have plenty of expierence. This isn&apos;t between me and you about whose got the biggest one.

I have never been on a guided hunt, and I have hunted my home state for 37 years. I can find my way around. You probably can also? I know what your talking about some folks can&apos;t.
  Quote: I salute the guy who never leaves his home state or province, but hunts just as hard as a person can.
 
So you salute me is that it? That&apos;s what I read? Very good then thank you.

I&apos;m sure I have been at this longer than you, because I&apos;m older 61, and I have been hunting ever since I was knee high to my dad. I probably still am knee high to him morally, but that&apos;s another subject.

You have been on maybe more and better hunts, because of your financial situation, and your residence in Alaska. Some people may not judge the quality of a hunt- that way. Me for instance.
Congrats on your griz or brown bear by the way[hard to tell from the avator]. That&apos;s something I always wanted.

Now I would like to bow out of this thread gracefully. If that is possible. Wiggy bags are OK so is your store. I just don&apos;t consider them backpacking bags. Some people do and that&apos;s OK too.

I will gladly buy a WIGGY&apos;s bag from you if you will take me bear hunting.

PS Mine is bigger than yours

PM me about when we can get together on the bear hunt 

Good bye hopefully forever
