97%
 
OF OUR MANAGERS STARTED OUT ROLLING BURRITOS * 
 *In 2011 97% of our salaried managers were promoted from hourly positions within Chipotle. One of the many reasons why Chipotle is unlike other fast food companies is the fact that nearly all of the leaders are promoted from our crew. Many restaurant companies hire &quot;professional&quot; managers to run their restaurants and almost never look to their crews for new leaders. But last year at Chipotle, 97% of our general managers were promoted from our crews and because our company is growing, there&apos;s plenty of opportunity. Countless people who came simply looking for a job now find themselves leading dozens, or even thousands of people while enjoying a career that is totally fulfilling, fun, and financially rewarding beyond anything they thought possible. It&apos;s pretty simple: If you work hard, you&apos;ll get noticed and before you know it, you&apos;ll be on a roll. 
NO EXPERIENCE PREFERRED
 
WE&apos;RE NOT LIKE OTHER FAST FOOD COMPANIES AND IT STARTS WITH OUR PEOPLE.
 When Steve Ells started Chipotle back in 1993, he only intended to open one restaurant—not a chain of more than 1,200. Because of that, he broke all of the rules and Chipotle became a new kind of fast food restaurant. In fact, we do just about everything differently and it starts with the people we hire to work in our restaurants. We&apos;ve learned that experience in other fast food restaurants isn&apos;t of much value at Chipotle. That&apos;s because we really cook food at Chipotle. And that&apos;s just the beginning of what we do differently. Our Crew members learn what they need to do on the job and in turn, they become the future leaders of our company. It&apos;s on-the-job training like you have never had before.

 Q: Why did you make the decision to work at Chipotle? A: I was staying with my dad&apos;s side of the family and was just looking for a summer job. I saw a new Chipotle location and decided to ask for an application. I didn&apos;t know at the time that this would turn into the career I have today, but I loved the food and thought it would be a fun place to work. Q: How long did it take you to be promoted? A: It took about 9 months to be promoted to General Manager and this was before the Restaurateur position existed so I waited a few years for that next promotion. Today, 8 years after starting with Chipotle I am a Team Director overseeing 50+ restaurants and 1400+ employees. Q: How has Chipotle impacted your life? A: Chipotle has changed my entire family&apos;s life. I didn&apos;t have a lot growing up and now I have been able to change that cycle for my family. I bought my first home and have been able to provide a great life for my family. I can&apos;t imagine what my life would be like if I did not make the decision to work here. Q: What is your favorite menu item? A: Chicken burrito with cilantro lime rice, vegetarian black beans, roasted chili corn salsa, green tomatillo salsa, sour cream and cheese. Q: What advice do you have for someone interested in Chipotle? A: Be prepared to work hard in order to be successful here. You must be able to elevate the people around you. Chipotle is all about the people culture and believes that the only way to run great restaurants is by having the best team of people.

 Q: Why did you make the decision to work at Chipotle? A: I started to work for Chipotle while I was in College. I heard that Chipotle had paid breaks and you ate for free - perfect in the eyes of a college student! I brought in my resume, filled out an application and an interview or two later, I was hired! Q: How long did it take you to be promoted? A: I worked at Chipotle while I was still in college so I took about 4 years to grow from crew member to General Manager. After being a GM for a year and a half, I was promoted to Restaurateur. Q: What is your favorite menu item? A: My first love was a steak burrito with black beans, hot salsa, and guacamole. My current obsession is the vegetarian salad with black beans, fajitas, tomatillo green salsa and guacamole. Q: What advice do you have for someone interested in Chipotle? A: Chipotle is more than just coming in for a paycheck and it doesn&apos;t matter if you work 2 or 5 days a week. It is about enjoying what you do, the people you work with and making an impact every day you come to work. If you are passionate about food, enjoy working with people and commit yourself to more than just your own success, you&apos;ll fit in just fine. Q: What do you like best about working here?

 Q: Why did you make the decision to work at Chipotle? A: I responded to a job posting that I saw for my local Chipotle. In my interview I was excited to hear more about the company and opportunities for advancement. I had admired the concept for a while and was willing to take a pay cut in order to join the team, knowing that I could move up quickly. Q: How long did it take you to be promoted? A: I was with Chipotle for a little over a year when I was promoted to Restaurateur. Q: What is your favorite menu item? A: This is really tough as I really love everything on our menu but if I had to pick one item I would say a chicken salad with fresh tomato salsa, roasted chili corn and guacamole topped with our chipotle honey vinaigrette dressing. Q: What do you like to do outside of work? Q: What does the future hold for your career at Chipotle? A: I hope to take on more responsibilities as I continue to develop high performers and future leaders for years to come. I hope that I can work for Chipotle until I retire.
