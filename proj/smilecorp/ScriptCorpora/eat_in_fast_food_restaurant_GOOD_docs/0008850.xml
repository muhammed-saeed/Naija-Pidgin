CORONA–A 46-acre fire that burned next to 91 freeway Wednesday afternoon was caused by a cutting torch at a construction site, authorities said.

A large plume of smoke was visible Wednesday afternoon at the Green River Road exit, where the fire continued to grow slowly until firefighters were able to surround it using an air attack. The fire was declared contained before evening. Firefighters will continue putting out hot spots until 6 p.m. Thursday, said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for CalFIRE.

The fire was reported at 1:48 p.m. Wednesday, just south of the 91 freeway. First reported as a 2-acre fire, the fire grew as it traveled up a slope, officials said. CalFIRE officials said the fire had the potential to grow up to 100 acres, but dying winds helped firefighters hold it well below that.

About 200 firefighters from the Corona, Orange County Fire Authority, Anaheim and CalFIRE departments responded to the blaze, including two helicopters from OCFA.

No evacuations were ordered and the fire did not appear to threaten any structures.

The fire appears to have been accidentally set by a cutting torch that was being used at a nearby construction site, Berlant said. Power tools are a major cause of wildfires in the Riverside County area, Berlant said, adding that people who use power tools outdoors should take proper precautions to avoid sparking a fire.
