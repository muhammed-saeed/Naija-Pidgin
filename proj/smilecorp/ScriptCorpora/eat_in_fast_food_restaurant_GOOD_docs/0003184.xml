		Investigating S lip 
 and Fall Accidents
By James W. Harbert CLI, FCI 



 
In twenty-five years of investigating slip and fall accidents here is what 
 I have learned. They don’t settle quickly and they do need investigation. For those lawyers who think they are small cases that will eventually pay 
 out, forget it. You are doing your client a disservice. In order 
 to settle a slip and fall the attorney must have witnesses, photographs and 
 standards. The witness can be an engineer, the photos can be after the 
 fact but they must illustrate the location and the hazard and the hazard must 
 be covered by a standard that requires that the hazard be identified or eliminated. 
 
In many cases the engineer is your best witness. Get him out there immediately. As soon as you get the case. It is recommended that you put an engineer 
 experienced in slip and fall cases on retainer to respond immediately. Don’t let this wait. Get the ball rolling. 
 
Interview family members or anyone that was with the victim when the accident 
 occurred. Don’t wait until later thinking that you have plenty 
 of time. Memories fade as time passes. Go to the scene with the 
 family and/or witnesses if possible. Find out exactly where the accident 
 occurred.  If an ambulance was called, talked to the Emt’s. If the local volunteer fire department responded, run them down and take statements 
 from them. In other words treat these cases seriously.
 
Many of the retailers and grocery chains treat Slip and Fall’s very 
 seriously. They keep an adjusting firm on retainer that they call immediately 
 in the event of a slip and fall that could produce a claim. These adjusters 
 statementize the clerks and witnesses, make a report and take photographs 
 of the scene. They have the evidence and chances are you won’t 
 hear a lot about it until way late in your claim. 
 
Slip-and-fall and trip-and-fall accidents can occur almost anywhere. The most 
 common places, of course, are public places. Individuals who run public establishments 
 such as restauúrants or grocery stores have a responúsibility 
 to ensure that the walking surfaces are safe.
 
In the case of an elderly person, a slip-and-fall can mean the end of their 
 normal healthy lives. Often, a shattered hip precipitates a decline in health, 
 attitude and recuperative strength.
 
On a recent trip to a national discount store I saw an elderly man slip and 
 fall when coming in the back entrance next to the catalog counter. Store 
 personnel had just finished washing down the outside entrance so it was still 
 wet. His feet just came right out from underneath him. I thought 
 the fact that they were washing the entrance to the store was a little strange 
 during store hours.  The store had a non-slip mat at the entrance, 
 and signs out. What the store failed to do was realize that while washing 
 down the entire walk and loading area just before the store opened, they left 
 residual water all around the entrance and this is a hazard to shoppers.
 
This particular gentleman had on good lace-up shoes, but they had hush-puppy 
 style foam rubber soles. These give you maximum grip strength under most circumstances; 
 however, when the soles get wet and come in contact with a polished linoleum 
 floor, the coefficient of friction goes haywire. His feet just came out from 
 underúneath him. He came down and landed on his shoulder and side. 
 It was a distressing thing to see.
 
In trying to figure out what hapúpened in a case such as this, the 
 investigator should go outside and look at how the store is laid out. If possible, go back to the store and photograph the employees washing the 
 area down on another occasions. See what they do inside the store. Do they take any precautions? Was this an exception or did they always wash 
 down the outside when the store was opened? Look at the composition 
 of the outside walking area, does it retain water? Is it covered so 
 it will not evaporate as fast as if it was in the sun? Is there a store 
 policy on this? If so, where is it written? Large national discount 
 stores usually have policy manuals, look for it in discovery. 
 
Another case involving this store involved popcorn in the walkway. Many 
 of the large stores sell popcorn to shoppers. It is a great treat until 
 it gets on the floor. How slippery is popcorn, Jim Anderson, a 
 nationally known engineer and slip-and-fall expert, concentrated on two main 
 areas; the coefficient of friction of various size kernels of popcorn 
 on linoleum floors, and the ability of clerks to see items spilled on the 
 floor adjacent to the counters. It turns out that the counter was piled too 
 high with candy to allow the clerks to see the spilled popcorn in front of 
 the display. In addition, the popcorn on a linoleum floor was extremely 
 slippery. This is one of those cases that you hear about where the store 
 manager or security personnel are taking statements from the victim while 
 she is on the floor and being loaded on the stretcher. 
 
Remember to ask for the manuals on safety policies and procedures for the 
 store. This particular chain had a comprehensive one. You will also find that 
 many such retail stores videotape everything that goes on in the store. Often 
 the store has a videotape of the actual slip-and-fall. Request that 
 through pleadings.
 
In another recent case against a superúmarket, the client, as he had 
 done for many years, was delivering milk. A piece of cardboard covered 
 a hole in the floor at the service entrance. His milk cart hit the hole, and 
 the load shifted forward and was about to fall on a customer. He rescued the 
 load by hauling back on it, and, in doing so, ruptured a disc.
 
What was unusual about this case is that once we sued and got into discovery, 
 we found that the store had a safety manual that an insurance company had 
 prepared for their use. One of the first things listed in the manual is the 
 prevention of accidents. And listed first under prevention of accidents was 
 the floor. The first item under the floor heading stated that“Holes, 
 cracks and defects must be repaired immediately.”Obúviously, 
 the supermarket had not folúlowed its own manual, and that virútually 
 made the case.
 
Many lawyers look with disdain at slip-and-fall accidents, often relegatúing 
 them to the most junior associate. But slip-and-fall accidents usually result 
 in serious injuries, and my exúperience dictates that they are very 
 good cases.
 
Don’t scoff if you are assigned a slip-and-fall case; rather, go to 
 the scene and look around before you do anything. It may help to return to 
 the scene at the time corresponding to that of the slip-and-fall. You may 
 find a quick answer to your search, such as the wash-down procedures outside 
 the store on that particular day.
 
 Grocery stores, department stores, and other places where people shop 
 regularly have a greater responúsibility to ensure that their walking 
 surfaces are safe. This is especially true because everything in these esútablishments 
 directs your attention away from the floor and to the shelves. The height 
 of the shelves and their configurations are designed to correspond to the 
 size of shopping cart being used. Next time you are in a grocery store, if 
 you will push your cart up against a shelf, you will see that the bumper of 
 the basket hits the shelf and does not knock anything off.
 
Why is this important? One of the first cases I worked involved an elderly 
 woman who slipped and fell in a broken bottle of applesauce in a grocery store. She broke her hip. She swore that someone had dropped the bottle and 
 she just slipped in it. We found that a K mart next door to this grocery store 
 had smaller carts than the grocery store. She had picked up one of these carts, 
 carried it into the store, and was using it to shop. The manager and his assisútant 
 said this was common, and there was neither a sign nor an effort to keep these 
 carts out.
 
Because the carts did not match the size shelves in the store, as she was 
 walking along the aisle containing the applesauce, the edge of the cart tapped 
 the bottom of the applesauce, knocking over a jar right in her path. It hit 
 and she slipped at the same time, breaking her hip.
 
 Test for Reasonableness 
 
As you can see, there is more to slip-and-fall cases than just whether or 
 not the substance has been on the floor for an unreasonable length of time. 
 The usual test for reasonableúness in a grocery store or a public place 
 is 15 minutes. In the case prevúiously cited, the division manager 
 for the grocery store had checked the entire store five minutes before the 
 accident and had not seen anything on the floor. Of course, we know why; and 
 he later found out why. This is, however, often the retailer’s defense. 
 The staff checked it and, therefore, the store is not liable.
 
But during the investigation, the manager was photographed with one of the 
 smaller carts adjacent to the applesauce. We used this to settle the case 
 quickly and fairly for our client.
 
 
 A List of Musts 
 
There are several things that can be done and must be done by the individual 
 responding to the case. In many cases, there are no witnesses. If so, the 
 next sources are the paraúmedics or ambulance crews. In rural or suburban 
 areas, volunteer firemen often will respond to ambulance calls for first-aid. 
 They have proven to be highly reliable sources for information relating to 
 the conditions the client was found in.
 
In cases involving restaurants or grocery stores, often the substance the 
 client has fallen on is soapy water. Often, the responding medical personnel 
 will not make a note as to the conditions of the scene, but they remember 
 it. A good question used by one of the attorneys in our law firm is:
 
   “Were there tracks through the water or footprints 
 making the water or subústance dirty, indicating a lot of traffic in 
 that area (or that the substance had been on the floor for quite a period 
 of time)?”
 
 Often, attending medical peoúple will remember that, or soaked 
 clothes or slipperiness of the substance the client slipped in. Any of this 
 is important in dealing with the insurúance company. We have even gone 
 to the extent on occasion of having clothes or shoes tested for soap resiúdue.”
 
In addition, the investigator should know what type of shoes the client was 
 wearing, and what type of floor the client slipped on. In slip-and-fall cases, try to ascertain early what type of shoes the client was wearing, and obtain 
 them if possible. There are certain factors that remain constant. Rubber flip-flop 
 shoes when wet are extremely slippery. Merchants should know this as well, 
 and plan accordingly. Slip-and-falls can occur, however, even using the best 
 shoes. We have had slip-and-falls with leather heels, rubber heels, composite 
 heels, and even vibram soles. The important elements are the combination of 
 the heel and sole, the substance on the floor, and the floor itself.
 
In areas such as foyers and entrances to stores, it may not be a bad idea 
 to have non-slip floors. That is, a painted surface on the floor with some 
 type of friction material that will keep people from falling. This would be 
 in the foyers, where people are coming in and out from the rain. Such areas 
 are difficult to keep dry. After people leave the foyers, there would be a 
 long carpet or mat inside the store to ensure that their shoes are dried before 
 hitting the slick aisles that are so common.
 
An engineer can do a test for the coefficient of friction on the floor. Some 
 floors are more slippery than others. If the floors have been covered with 
 a very slick type of wax, an enúgineer doing this test can find this 
 easily.
 
In 2001 many retail risk managers have started using floor applications that 
 reduce slipperiness. When walking into a fast food restaurant if the 
 floor feels sticky it is not because it has not been washed. Look at 
 it, it is clean. There is a substance applied that reduces slip and 
 falls. 
 
All these items are well and good, but the investigator’s job is to 
 try to identify any problems or situaútions that can help the client. 
 One recent case involved a fried chicken store in a shopping mall. The store 
 had placed its trash container at the entrance and exit. Everyone going in 
 and out would use this container and put full drinks and such into it. If 
 there were any leaks in the plastic bags, the liquid would leak onto the floor 
 right at the entrance. Our client was walking out and her feet went out from 
 underneath her in a puddle of water adjacent to this garbage can. She severely 
 damaged her back.
 
 Telling Photographs 
 
In investigating this case, photograph the establishment from the mall’s 
 main thoroughfare. During this session the investigator should be able to 
 easily see the problem: In this particular case there was liquid on the floor 
 nearly the entire time the investigator was taking pictures. If you use a 
 data back on your camera the time portion on it can be extremely important.
 
Admittedly, evidence of negliúgence after a particular accident would 
 not put the shop on notice. But what these type of photographs show is a pattern 
 of negligence involving the placement of this trash container:
 
• The trash container needs to have a thick plastic liner with 
 the regular, thinner plastic bag inside.
 
• A trash container in such an outlet should be placed in a non-traffic 
 area, not in a location where everyone entering and leaving is going to walk 
 right past it.
 
• The container must be easily visible by counter help to see 
 if any liquid or food has been spilled in the aisle-way.
 
 Restrooms 
 
A restaurant’s restroom is always a prime location for a slip-and-fall. 
 Many restaurants do not check their rest rooms as often as they should. Often, 
 individuals using these facilities will walk from a foyer area into the restroom 
 area, and the floor will have some food or liquid on it, and you can easily 
 slip and fall. It is easy to photograph these interior locations, but quite 
 frequently you will be stopped from photographing other parts of a restaurant, 
 or at least asked some embarrassing questions unless you take precautions.
 
 Loose Ends 
 
Cases involving a loose piece of carpet, a piece of tile that has come 
 up, or anything else that is interfering with safe travel on the floor should 
 be responded to immediately. In these cases it is absolutely necessary that 
 you obtain a photoúgraph of it as soon as possible to show the condition 
 in the restaurant.
 
If you believe that you will be challenged by walking in and taking a photograph 
 unannounced, the investigator may need to use a ruse or some type of surreptitious 
 means of obtaining it. A ruse is not a lie. Don’t lie to 
 anyone. As attorney’s and investigators we are in the business 
 of determining the truth. We do not start a quest for the truth with 
 a lie.  What is being discussed as a ruse is framing a situation 
 that would be normal to the store or restaurant and using for the investigator 
 to get the photographs that he needs. If it is a public place you can 
 take photographs unless you are stopped. This is not illegal, and it 
 is most cerútainly in your client’s interest. Often, you can 
 have several people together at a table in a restaurant, and it is not uncommon 
 to take photographs in restaurants during special occasions. Using a telephoto 
 lens, you can shoot past the individuals to the defect in the floor. In the 
 case of the trash container at the mall store I used my small daughter to 
 play in the hallway of the mall and shot past her to obtain the photographs 
 of the container. This is not disruptive and is looked upon as normal 
 activity. Many times I have used a motor drive on my Nikon with 1000 
 ASA film and no flash. Just walking through a store when the accident 
 happened with a 28mm lens taking photographs will document what you will need 
 for your file. 
 
Steps or hallways can be a problem in public establishments. There are building 
 code and OSHA regulations that require certain building specifications.. If 
 the steps or the stairs are a problem, measure and photograph them.  Measure the total height, then the height of each of the risers and each of 
 the treads. It is probably best to have an engineer check them. If there is 
 any problem with the covering on the stairs or the stairway, you need to photograph 
 and document that as early as possible.
 
At night some parking lots are too dark. If this is a cause of an accident, 
 the investigator should document the location of each of the lights and, if 
 possible, the watútage and coverage of each light at night. It 
 is difúficult to take a picture and simulate exactly what the eye can 
 see. Instead, identify and locate each of the lights in the specific area 
 where the client fell.
 
There is not much the investigator can do to photograph the floor of a grocery 
 store when the material that was spilled on it is cleaned up or there is no 
 evidence of the slip-and-fall. In some instances, you can show a pattern. 
 In cases in which the store has trouble with freezer units, soft drink machines, 
 or leaks in the roof that create wet floors, you can see and photograph a 
 stain in the area. If the store has had a lot of problems of that type, there 
 is a good chance you will see evidence of them. Other things to look for include 
 tripping hazards, such as tiles missing, concrete patches, or obstructions 
 on the floor. Check for all these things.
 
Another thought. Find the location of the spill and the product used. In one case a fall was caused by a windshield wiper gallon container with 
 a faulty cap. When picked up and turned a little the liquid would leak 
 from the cap. This turned into a premises and a product liability case. 
 
 When Signs Deceive 
 
Department stores and grocery stores often use signs and other deúvices 
 to warn customers in the parking lots. But sometimes, the design of these 
 signs makes them a tripping hazard! If the sign is designed with a stabilizing 
 foot that extends in both direcútions, it is easy to trip over these 
 stabilizers. 
 
 Holes and depressions in the ground 
 
Other outdoor hazards lurk in parks and other areas where individuúals 
 are meant to walk, run and play. In parks and playgrounds you may have decomposition 
 depressions, depressions from construction, or old tree stumps that have decomposed, 
 creating a hole in the ground. The Investigator needs to check the site as 
 soon as he gets the case. Often, a depression appears suddenly, perúhaps 
 caused by some organic material that has been decomposing underúground 
 and has just collapsed. This can be confirmed by taking a core sample from 
 the depressed area. If the parks or grounds department has alúready 
 filled in the hole, it is important that you know its exact location. For 
 this reason, you need to photograph it as soon as possible and measure it 
 so that after a suit is filed, the court can order a core sample from the 
 exact trip-and-fall site.
 
In Florida there is a Florida statute that prohibits leaving a hole 2 x 2 
 x 2 or larger uncovered. In situations such as these it must be cordoned 
 or covered to be made safe. 
 
 
 Parking Lot Hazards, sidewalks:
  
There are many hazards in parkúing lots. In one case, a sparkling-clean 
 gasoline station required clients to pump their gas and then drive up to the 
 pay area. Our client didn’t know that you drove up to the area, and, 
 wearing flip-flops, walked up the hill to the pay area.
 
The people who constructed this station had used a very smooth asphalt and 
 then painted it with a non-porous sealer.. This created several problems: 
 The surface was extremely slick; and it was difficult to wash or remove soap 
 from it. Our client slipped and fell on the way up the hill and injured himself 
 severely. The surface actually needed a friction compound or friction-based 
 paint, which would offer good footing. The station’s composition and 
 design figured heavily in the settlement. Close-up photographs of the grounds 
 and aerial photographs played an important role.
 
Parking lots are notorious for concrete tire guards, and people trip over 
 these all the time. In and of themselves, they are not a hazard, but their 
 locaútion can be, as can their state of repair. Sometimes, a case can 
 be made using these factors, or if the rebar used to secure them to the parking 
 lot, is either hanging out or creating an additional hazard due to the state 
 of disrepair.
 
Areas around which large numúbers of people congregate, such as bus 
 stops or train stations, have to be carefully guarded for tripping and slipping 
 hazards. If the attorney reacts quickly to a call from a client, photographs 
 of the problems in these areas can be made sealing the liability. If you are 
 fortunate enúough to find an existing problem after a client has been 
 injured, photograph it from as many angles as possible. Photograph it with 
 a wide-angle lens to show its full perspective of location, measure it with 
 a tape measure, and make the photograph with the tape in the picture to show 
 perspective.
 
Illustrating the necessity to move quickly, our office received a call from 
 the daughter of a prospective client, who was in the hospital with a broken 
 leg and a broken arm after having slipped and fallen at a bus stop. Upon meeting 
 her at the hospital, it was determined that the condition might still exist. 
 The transit authority had just black-topped the area of this bus stop and, 
 to outline the location, had used surveyors’wooden stakes, some of 
 which they hadn’t removed. When our client got off of the bus, she tripped 
 over a 2-inch stake in the actual black-top. There is no way that she could 
 have known anything like that would be there.
 
The daughter and I photoúgraphed the stakes, showing them from all 
 different angles, and their height above the ground by using a tape measure 
 adjacent to the stakes. These photographs were packed away in the file, and 
 as the case progressed, it became necessary to file suit. The first thing 
 the transit authority did was deny the stakes were ever there. If it hadn’t 
 been for these photographs, that would have been their primary defense, and 
 they never would have paid.
 
Sidewalks can be extremely deceptive. They can be uneven, causúing 
 trip points; roots can grow into them; they break and become unlevel, and 
 in general, they can be extremely dangerous if they are not maintained properly. 
 Many instituútions, such as schools and colleges, do not really care 
 about the conditions of the sidewalks once they pour them and put them down. 
 Many sidewalks are from 20 to 50 years old and are split in a hundred different 
 pieces. They may not cause a problem during the daytime, if the students are 
 careful. But at night, anyone unfamiliar with the campus could have a serious 
 probúlem. In addition, the light must be very good around entrances 
 and exits to buildings and on sidewalks.
 
The problem is that with the beginning of each term in a college, the students 
 use different facilities and there is a certain amount of unfamilúiarity. 
 If the entrances, exits, and sideúwalks are not properly lit, serious 
 accidents may result. Other things clients may trip and fall over are the 
 gratings popular 10 or 15 years ago in public buildings. Positioned at the 
 entrances, they cover holes and were intended to wipe your feet on before 
 entering the building. High heels have gotten stuck in those things and people 
 have been thrown n their faces. These gratings are a hazard, and there are 
 not many enúgineers who will say they are not.
 
Slip-and-falls and trip-and-falls around homes can be some of the most serious, 
 but easiest to document. Examples are obstructions to pathúways, traps 
 and other obstacles that could injure people cutting through the yard.
 
Inside the house, many accidents occur as a result of slipping and falling 
 on water or other substances on the floor. Or, as in one case my law firm 
 handled, a non-rubber-backed throw rug on a polished wood floor. The client 
 was coming out of a kitchen into a hallway, stepped on the rug, and it came 
 out from underneath her, causúing her to fall and break her hip. In 
 a case such as this, the floor and hallway should be photographed, and measureúments 
 of the distance or width of the hallway should be taken. If the individúual 
 is coming out of a room, there is more of a chance of the rug coming out from 
 underneath if slipperiness exists. There has been quite a bit of products 
 liability litigation based on the fact that these non-rubber-backed throw 
 rugs are inherently dangerous.
 
Other things to notice are failure to properly maintain steps or pathúways, 
 or whether slick surfaces are not taken care of.
 
 Mobile-Home Hazards 
 
The biggest problem in mobile home parks are the temporary stairúways 
 used for access. As they age, these homemade stairs, often made of untreated 
 lumber, rot away. The investigator can really see some terrible stairs on 
 rented trailers. Photograph these stairs and railings from all angles, using 
 a wide-angle lens to photograph the entire area. Close-ups should be taken 
 showing the deterioraútion of the wood. Pay attention to the railings 
 remembering if the stairs are over a certain height they must have hand rails.
