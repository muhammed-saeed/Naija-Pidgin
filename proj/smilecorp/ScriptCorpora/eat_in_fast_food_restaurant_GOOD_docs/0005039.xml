 This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world&apos;s books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that&apos;s often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book&apos;s long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you.

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google&apos;s system: If you are conducting research on machine

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can&apos;t offer guidance on whether any specific use of

Hill, J., said that the practice determined on and 
adopted by the Judges was, not to issue bench warrants, 
unless from the nature of the crime it was necessary to 
have the party charged with the offence at once taken into 
custody, or unless it was shown that the party charged 
with the offence was about to quit the country (a). The 
Judge&apos;s clerk would make out a summons in the ordinary 
form, to be served upon the party, requiring him to appear 
in London at Judges&apos; Chambers, to show cause why a 
bench warrant should not issue against him.

REGINA V. CLARKE. 

Thomas CLARKE, aged forty-five, was indicted for 
the wilful murder of Patrick Coley, at Horton, on the 28th 
of August lasl. 

Blanshard and Wheelhouse prosecuted. 

Price defended the prisoner. 

It appeared that hoth the prisoner and the deceased man 
were Irish, and that on the 28th of August last the prisoner 
had a christening and merry-making at his house, in the 
course of which alternate quantities of rum and beer were 
consumed. At night the deceased wanted half a gallon 
more beer sent for, which prisoner refused to allow. This 
led to a kind of wrangle between them, which led to a dis- 
cussion as to the respective merits of their native counties, 
and to the prisoner eventually ejecting his friend, the de- 
ceased, from his house. The deceased attempted to get in 
again, but the door was locked. The deceased attempted 
to get in by kicking at the door, and, as his shoes were 
thin, he asked the bystanders assembled if any of them 
bad thicker shoes on that he might kick the door-panel in. 
At length the prisoner, exasperated by this hammering at 
his door, opened it, and the deceased went in, and the 
prisoner was then seen to strike him three blows on the 
body, which were followed by loud screams of murder !&quot; 
from the deceased. It was found that the man* had re- 
ceived three severe stabs in the body, and he was carried 
home and a surgeon sent for, who, being of opinion that 
he could not recover, from the nature of the wounds, a 
magistrate was sent for to take his deposition, and the 
prisoner was taken into custody. The statement of the 
deceased was then taken down in writing as a dying decla- 
ration, and next day, in the presence of the prisoner, this 




NORTHERN CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 

Statement was read over to him^ and he said it was correct^ 1859. 
&apos;&apos;as a dying man.&quot; The deceased died two days after- 
wards, and on the 3rd of September the witnesses made 
their depositions before the magistrates against the prisoner 
on a charge of murder of the deceased, and the deposition 
of the deceased was included as having been taken on that 
charge under the same caption. On its being proposed by 
the learned counsel for the prosecution to put in evidence 
this deposition, it was objected by the learned counsel for 
the prisoner that it was taken on a charge of a different 
offence, namely, of cutting and wounding the deceased, 
who subsequently died. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — The caption shows that the examina- 
tion was taken on a charge of murder, and the caption 
shows that it is the examination of the man charged with 
being murdered, for the &apos;&apos; murder&apos;&apos; of himself. 

Blanshard submitted that it was admissible, for the 
name of the person charged with being murdered might be 
struck out of the caption. 

WiGHTMAM, J. — ^Then that would not be the charge on 
which he was examined. 

Blanshard referred to BeestorCs Case (a). 

WiGHTMAN, J. — If the prisoner bad been charged with 
feloniously cutting and stabbing the deceased, and the de- 
ceased had afterwards died, the deposition taken on the 
charge of cutting and stabbing might have been used on 
the charge of murder. 

Blanshard submitted that the caption was sufBcieHt. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — Will it do without any caption at all ? 
Unfortunately the charge in the caption is a charge of 
murder, and the caption states this to be the examination 
of the man who is charged as having been murdered. I 
want an authority where a man is charged with murder on

CASES ON THE 

the examination of the man murdered, before I can admit 
this. 

JBlanshard then proposed to put the document in evi- 
dence as a dying declaration. The evidence of the surgeon 
showed that he had told the deceased he had no chance of 
recovery before he made the statement, and he died two 
days after. When the surgeon told him that, the deceased 
spoke out and said, ** Oh, I am a dying man.&apos;&apos; 

WiGHTMAN, J., held the document admissible as a dying 
declaration after this evidence. 

The examination of the deceased stated an account of 
the quarrel, and that the prisoner had stabbed him. The 
surgeon&apos;s evidence proving that these stabs had caused the 
death of the deceased. 

The prisoner was found guilty of manslaughter, 
and sentenced to fifteen years&apos; penal servitude.

REGINA r. HAY. 

W ILLI AM HAY, aged twenty-two, pitman, was charged 
with robbing Daniel Kennedy of a silver watch, at Jarrow, 
on the 25th December last. 

Headlam for the prosecution. 

Davidson for the defence. 

On the 24th of December the prosecutor had been 
drinking at the BeeVwing public-house, in the Felling, 
and left about twelve o&apos;clock at night. On his way home, 
the ground being very slippery, he fell down, and was 
assisted to his feet by the prisoner and three other men. 
They walked a short distance together, but the prosecutor 
feeling the prisoner&apos;s hand in his pocket told him to take 
it out, which he did. The men then endeavoured to get 
the prosecutor to go a long way with them, but he refused, 




NORTHERN CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 

and walked away by himself. After having left the pri- &apos;^^^&apos; 
soner and the other naen, he proceeded on his way home. 
When he had gone a short distance, he was joined by a 
man named M&apos;Cormacky who struck him a blow on the 
eye with a stick or &quot; morgan rattler&quot; without the least 
provocation. The prisoner Hay then joined M&apos;Cormack, 
and kept hold of the prosecutor&apos;s hands while the other 
robbed him of his watch and Ids. in silver. M&apos;Corroack 
had absconded. 

Inspector Rogers, by whom the prisoner was appre- 
hended, stated that from information he received he went 
to the house of the Rev. John Kelly, a Roman Catholic 
priest, from whom he received a watch, which the prose- 
cutor identiGed as his property, and who was now called. 

The crier of the Court was about to administer the oath 
to hiro, when he objected to the form of the oath. 

His Lordship.— What is the objection ? 

The Rev. Mr. Kelly.— Not that I shall tell the truth, 
and nothing but the truth ; but, as a minister of the 
Catholic Church, I object to the part &apos;that states that I 
shall tell the whole truth. 

His Lordship said, the meaning of the oath is this: it 
is the whole truth touching the trial which you are asked ; 
which you, legitimately according to law, can be asked. 
If anything is asked of you in the witness-box which the 
law says ought not to be asked— for instance, if you are 
asked a question the answer to which might criminate 
yourself— you would be entitled to say, &quot; 1 object to 
answer that question, because the answer might criminate 
myself,** and the law would sustain the objection. You 
can therefore have no objection as a loyal subject, and in 
duty to the laws of the country, to answer the whole truth 
touching the case which may be lawfully asked (a). There- 
fore you must be sworn,

The witness took the oath ift the usual form, and gave 
the following evidence: — I have been twelve years Catholic 
priest at the Felling. On Christmas-day I received the 
watch produced. 

Headlam then asked, from whom did you receive that 
watch ? 

Witness. — I received it in connexion with the confes- 
sional. 

His Lordship. — You are not asked at present to dis- 
close anything stated to you in the confessional (a); you 



(a) It has been erroneously sup- 
posed that the learned Judge 
denied that any privilege attached 
to confession ; but, as will be seen, 
he did not deny it ; on the contrary, 
impliedly admitted it, and drew a 
distinction which would otherwise 
have been futile. That there is such 
a privilege can scarcely be denied. 
As a learned writer truly observes: 
** There cannot be a doubt that, 
previous to the Reformation, state* 
ments made to a priest under the 
seal of confession were privileged, 
except, perhaps, when the matter 
thus communicated amounted to 
high treason.&quot; (Best on Presump- 
tive Evidence, p. 596.) The 
learned writer, in support of the 
exception suggests, cited from the 
&quot;Ancient Laws and Institutes of 
England,&quot; a passage from the 
** Laws of Henry I. ;&quot; a comparison 
of which with the Saxon law in the 
same work (to which Lord Coke 
alludes as the sources of our com- 
mon law) win show that the recog- 
nition was of Saxon, and the ex* 
ception of Norman origin. The 
sanctity of confessioUi with that 
exception, has been recognized ; as 
in the 9th Edw. II., c. 10 :«- 



&quot;Placet etiam Domino Regi, 
ut latrones, vel (?) appellatores, 
quandocunque voluerint, possint 
sacerdotibus sua facinora confiteri, 
sed caveant confessores, no erro- 
nice hujusmodi appellatores infor- 
raent.&quot; 

Hereon Lord Coke comments 
thus :— 

&quot;^ Latrones vel appellatores. 
This branch extendetli only to 
thieves and approvers indited of 
felony, but extendeth not to high 
treasons; for if high treason be 
discovered to the oonfossor, he 
ought to discover it, for the danger 
that thereupon dependeth to the 
King and the whole Realme; 
therefore this branch declareth the 
common kw, that the priviledge of 
confession extendeth only to felo- 
nies: so this branch beginneth 
with thieves, extendeth only to 
approvers of thievery or felony, and 
not to appeales of treason.&quot; 

Now, here it is clearly recog- 
nized by Coke that there was such 
a privilege; and neither in Ran- 
dolph&apos;s case nor Garnet&apos;s does it 
appear that the communication 
was in sacramental confession ; and 
80 under, the seal of confession. On

are asked a sirople fact — from whom did you receive that 
watch which you gave to the policeman ? 

number of the Sacraments, &quot; Two 
only generally necessary to salva* 
tion,&quot; docs not amount to a state- 
ment that there are only two sacra- 
ments ; nor even that only two are 
ever necessary for salvation, but 
that only two are generally so. 
And it has been held that, accord- 
ing to our law, marriage is a sacra- 
ment {Richards v; Dovey, Willes 
Rep. 622), and it seems, from some 
decisions, to follow that confirma- 
tion is so. Even the Roman Ca- 
tholic Church does not consider 
all the seven sacraments she holds 
necessary to salvation. For in- 
stance, extreme unction is not. 
This has been regularly proved in 
our Courts in criminal cases, and 
acted upon {Regina v. Howell, 1 
C.&amp;K. 689). It follows, then, 
that not only was there nothing in 
the change which took place at the 
Reformation to alter the case as to 
the privilege attaching to confes- 
sion, but that there was, on the 
contrary, an express recognition of 
it by statute. For of course the 
recognition of confession implies, 
in the absence of anything to the 
contrary, the recognition of its 
secresy, because such was the 
common law rule ; and if it were 
otherwise, no one would be likely 
to confess, and therefore the direc- 
tions to the Anglican clergy, to 
exhort their penitents to confess, 
would be idle and futile. It fol- 
lows, also, that the clergy of the 
Established Church would be with- 
in the privilege in cases in which, 
acting according to the rubric of 
the Service for the Visitation of the 



i8ao. 



the contrary in Garnet&apos;s case. Lord 
Coke gave six reasons why the 
communication should not be 
deemed sacred ; not one of which 
involved a denial of the privilege, 
but all of which implied its exist- 
ence — the main reason being, that 
the communication was not in con- 
fession — the distinction taken by 
Hill, J., in the above case. The 
authority of Lord Coke, therefore, 
is clear that there was such a privi- 
lege at common law; and that such 
privilege continued after the sepa- 
ration from Rome, and after the 
alteration of religion. There had 
been no statute to take it away; 
and, on the contrary, the Prayer 
Book, sanctioned by statute, con- 
tained services in which {vide the 
Ordination Service) the clergy re- 
ceived power to give absolution, 
and {vide the Visitation of the 
Sick) were expressly directed, in 
certain cases, to administer it. The 
cases in which they were so di- 
rected were just those in which alone 
it is obligatory, as members of the 
Roman Catholic Church, to con- 
fess (i.e., grievous or weighty sins); 
and the form of absolution {ego te 
abiolvo, Sfc) is precisely that used 
by Roman Catholic priests, i.e., 
judicial or sacramental ; and not 
declaratory merely, as in the Morn- 
ing and Evening Services. ( Vide, as 
to this distinction, Wheatley or 
Shepherd on the Book of Common 
Prayer.) And though it is a com- 
mon idea that the Church of Eng- 
land denies that confession is a 
sacrament, that is an error ; for the 
answer in the Catechism as to the 




CASES ON THE 



1860. 




Witness. — The reply to that question would implicate 
the person who gave me the watch, therefore I cannot 
answer it (a). If I answered it, my suspension, for life 
would be a necessary consequence. I should be violating 
the laws of the Church, as well as the natural laws (b). 



Sick, and with a view to the giving 
of a judicial or sacramental absolu- 
tion, they have received confes- 
sions. But it is not so clear that 
otherwise they would be entitled to 
the privilege, or that ministers of 
any other religious body, not be- 
Ifeving in sacramental confession, 
would be entitled to it; at all 
events, according to the strict com- 
mon law rule upon the subject, 
which, according to the clearest 
authority, applied only to sacra- 
mental confession with a view to 
sacramental absolution. But the 
later cases on the subject seem to 
extend the privilege to any com- 
munications made to a spiritual 
adviser as such, whether or not in 
sacramental confession ; R, v. 
Griffin^ 6 Cox, Crown Cases, 219. 

(a) The distinction taken by 
the learned Judge was no doubt 
quite sound as regarded the legal 
privilege or protection attached to 
confession (for the matter was out 
of confession) ; although the obli- 
gation on the priest might possibly 
include anything which might indi- 
rectly tend to disclose what had 
been divulged in confession. 

(6) The authorities of the Bx)man 
Church define the obligation thus : — 
&quot;De sigillo Confessionis. Qusest. 
1. Quae,&amp;quanta sit obligatio 
sigilli Sacrament alls? Respond. 
Est omnino gravissima. Ita ut 
nee ad vitandam mortem liceat 
unquam Sacerdoti aliquid in Con^ 



Jettione auditum revelare; nee in 
hoc admittitur parvitas materiae, ut 
D.D. animadvertunt. Oritur au- 
tem hsec obligatio turn ex jure 
naturae, tum Elcclesiastico.&quot; * * 
* * &quot;Sigillum hoc est obligatio 
juris divini strictissima in omni 
casu, etiam quo integri regni salui 
periclitaretur, ad tacendum, etiam 
post mortem poenitentis, dicta in 
Cvnfessione (id est in ordine ad ab- 
totutionem iacramentalem) omnia, 
quorum revelatio sacramentum 
redderet onerosum, vel odiosum.&quot; 
But the obligation on the priest is 
one thing, the protection or pri- 
vilege to be extended to him ii 
quite another thing; a distinction 
which was not attended to in the 
comments which were made upon 
the ca«e. And the privilege could 
not extend to anything said or 
done by the penite*nt after, and 
out of, even although in conse- 
quence of, confession. On the con- 
trary, it might much more be said 
to have been, or at least might 
have been, in contravention of the 
spirit and object of the institution 
of confession; for, by the law of 
the Roman Catholic Church, satis- 
faction is an essential part of the 
Sacrament, and readiness to make 
it is a condition precedent to 
absolution. And satisfaction in 
some cases — ^as stealing — may, 
in some cases must, involve pub- 
lic or open confession ; as, for in- 
stance, in the case of anonymous 



NORTHERN CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 



His Lordship. — I have already told you plainly I can- 
Dot enter into this question. All I can say is, you are 
bound to answer, &quot; From whom did you receive that

asked to disclose anything that a penitent may have said 



I860.

slander; for it involves more than 
restitution — it involves reparation 
to any one directly or indirectly 
injured. And where there has 
been, as in the above case, a theft, 
and the guilt may be left doubt- 
ful by secret restitution, so that 
an innocent man may be con- 
victed, satisfaction involves an 
open restitution, or at least, in 
some way, the disclosure of the 
name of the guilty party. Others 
wise a murderer might obtain ab- 
solution while allowing ah inno- 
cent man to be hanged for his own 
crime. In other words, be might 
obtain pardon for one murder 
while in the act of committing, or 
causing, another and a worse mur- 
der. This being so, the priest, in 
such a case, is bound to exhort to 
open restitution ; and lending him- 
self, by some act of his, out of con- 
fession, to assist the penitent in 
keeping his crime secret, may be in 
utter contravention and cannot pos- 
sibly be in pursuance of the pur- 
pose and spirit of confession ; and 
so cannot possibly be within the 
privilege attaching to it. Nor does 
it at all affect this argtiment that 
the priest is still bound to secresy, 
for he cannot get rid of his obliga- 
tion by a wrongful act, which 
nevertheless deprives him of his 
privilege. It is apprehended, there- 
fore, that the decision of the learned 
Judge, and the reason and distinc- 
tion on which it was founded, were 



equally right ; and this plainly ap- 
pears from a number of cases on 
other kinds of privilege, which 
have proceeded on the same prin- 
ciple. Thus, counsel can be called 
upon to disclose matter that has 
come to their knowledge since they 
were counsel, and of their own 
knowledge. Spark v. Middleion^ 1 
Keb. 505 ; S. P. Cutt v. Puheny, 
Vent. 197. The privilege in coun- 
sel,&amp;c., is confined to cases where 
they are acting in their respective 
capacities, WUson v. Rattal, 4 
Term Rep. 753, and does not ap- 
ply to a mere gratis dictum, Cob- 
den v. Kenrickf ibid, 432; as in 
the above case, where the act of 
the priest was not in his capacity 
as such; for any other person 
might have restored the watch, and 
4ie was not at all bound to do so ; 
on the contrary (as already shown) 
he might be acting contrary to his 
duty in so doing. 

The decision was in conformity 
with many recent cases. 

An attorney is bound to discover 
when, and to whom, he parted with 
documents of his client, Banner v. 
Jackson, I De G.&amp;S. 472 ; S. P. 
Shore V. Bedford, 5 M.&amp;Gr. 271 ; 
and so where a prisoner had given 
a will he had forged to his attorney 
not for a professional purpose;

On this file it remained for several months, and various 
office copies, under the seal of the Court, were from time

to time obtained for the purposes of a litigation which arose i860. 
in connection with the estate. In the month of May, 1869, ^&quot;-^^^^^ 
defendant demanded inspection of the file. His proof of ei 

debt appearing thereon, the file wag handed to him by the **&quot;&quot;. &quot;.»£»• 
asher, and shortly afterwards returned by defendant to 
that oflker, who restored it to the customary place of de-i 
posit without examination. No examination was, indeed, 
again made of the file until the month of December, when 
this prosecution was instituted. The aflidavit had then 
disappeared from the file, and all searches for it had proved 
ineffectual. Hence the original could not be produced 
before the jury, but one of the office copies, under seal 
previously mentioned, would be tendered in evidence. 

Overendf Q.C. {Halher with him), objected that a copy 
could not be received in evidence, under any circunostances, 
on a trial for perjury. The law was clearly laid down in 
Taylor on Evidence (§ 1379, page 1232, 3rd ed. 1858). 
The learned author there, after describing the different 
means of proof of records, says : — &apos;&apos; One or other of these 
copies will always be admissible in lieu of the original 
record, excepting in two cases; first, if issue has been 
joined on a plea of replication of nul tiel record, in some 
cause in a Court to which the disputed record belongs; 
and, secondly, if a person is indicted for perjury in any 
affidavit, deposition or answer ; or for forgery with respect 
to any record. In either of these cases the original document 
must be actually produced**&apos; Now, upon the opening of 
counsel, it was admitted this could not be done. A notice 
to produce had been served on defendant; but the facta 
stated as to defendant&apos;s opportunities of access to the file 
did not trace the missing deposition to his possession, 
without which the notice was unavailable. An additional 
objection to the admissibility of any secondary evidence 
arose on the mode of proof. In perjury alleged to be con- 
tained in any written instrument it must be shown that 
the name subscribed to the affidavit,&amp;c. is of the hand-

that &quot; on a trial, too, for perjury, the signatures of the de- 
fendant and of the person whose name is attached to the 
jurat, must be proved.&quot; Hence he submitted that, as 
nothing short of the original document could be received 
in evidence, the prosecutor was out of Court, and the case 
could not be carried further. 

Leresche, in reply. — It is submitted the proposition of 
the learned text writer is too broadly stated, and not borne 
out by the cases cited. In anticipation of this objection 
those authorities (c) have been examined and are distin- 
guishable. In each instance the document was shown to 
be in existence, and within the reach of the prosecution. 
Though there was no direct authority against the statement 
in Taylor as to perjury, yet the corresponding proposition 
as to forgery cannot be reconciled with Rex v. Hunter {d). 
The true principle governing the case is there pointed out. 
There Park, J., told the grand jury that, where the instru- 
ment alleged to be forged, either from its being in the pos- 
session of the prisoner, or for any other sufficient cause^ 
cannot be produced, they might receive secondary evidence 
of its contents. In R, v. Chadwick {e), where goods were 
obtained by means of a false letter, which was lost between 
the committal and the trial, parol evidence of the contents 
was allowed. Perhaps the prosecution, on the reason

alleged by the defendant&apos;s counsel, could not rely much I860, 
on the notice to produce; but, as the non-production of ^T&quot;^&quot;^&quot;^ 
the original was under the circumstances reasonably ac- o. 

counted for, he urged that secondary evidence could be 
given of it as a lost instrument. 

Overend (in reply to Hill, J.) said he had not an autho- 
rity directly in point. He relied upon the text-book. 

Hill, J. — As it is admitted on both sides that there is 
no case expressly in point, I must decide the case upon 
principle. Assume a case of this kind : a roan has sworn 
before the Bankruptcy Court an affidavit which has been 
placed upon the file. The falsehood of the statements 
in that affidavit have been discovered ; the party has been 
examined before a magistrate and committed by him to 
the assizes ; the case is ripe for trial ; and a subpoena duces 
tecum has been served upon the officer who has the custody 
of the records of the Bankruptcy Court. On the evening 
before the trial, a fire takes place in the building where the 
Court sits, and where its records are preserved, and the 
latter are destroyed. In such case could it be contended 
that an office copy of the affidavit on which the perjury is 
assigned could not be received, and that, because by the 
act of God or of man the original evidence had been de- 
stroyed, the person charged with so pernicious an offence 
as perjury must escape scot free? I, for one, cannot con- 
sider such a proposition to be law. With all respect for 
the learned text writer who has been quoted, I shall hold 
that secondary evidence is admissible, upon a proper foun- 
dation being laid. Upon proof that the original has been 
lost or destroyed, I shall permit evidence to be given of an 
office copy (a). 

Overend asked for a case to be reserved for the Court of

made at the parish church on behalf of that Society. A 
sum of 18/. 3^. 9d. was collected on that occasion, and 
paid by the witness to his account withhis bankers. Early 
in the following December, the prisoner proposed to wit- 
ness that the money should be put into the sayings bank 



MIDLAND CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 16 

to make interest until March, at which time it would, in 1660. 
the usual course, be paid over to the parent Society in reo,ka 
London. Witness consented to let the prisoner have the v. 

money for that purpose, and drew a cheque upon bis dem garrett. 
bankers for 18/. 3^. 9d., which he gave to the prisoner. At 
the time when he gave this cheque to the prisoner, witness 
was aware that the prisoner had in his possession other 
monies, which had been collected in other ways for the 
same Society. In January following the witness, learning 
that the prisoner was involved in pecuniary difficulties, ap- 
plied to him to repay this money. Prisoner replied that 
he could not pay it, as the money was in the savings bank, 
and a week&apos;s notice must be given before it could be with- 
drawn. He added, ** If you want the money, I can give 
it you ; for I have money in the house. But you may be 
satisfied ; it is here ;&quot; and he held up a book containing 
the following entry : ** Received from the Rev. George 
Butt, 18/. 3*. 9d:&apos; Witness said, &quot; Then the money is 
paid in in my name?&quot; The prisoner replied, *&apos; No; it 
is paid in in my name, but as from you.&quot; Subsequently, 
on applying at the savings bank, the witness was informed 
that the money had never been paid in. Witness never 
recovered the money, and afterwards paid the 18/. 3s. 9d, 
to the Society out of his own pocket. Some two or three 
week after this transaction, and before the charge was 
made, witness was offered money by a Mr. Grattan, the 
prisoner&apos;s solicitor, who said he had instructions to pay 
the prisoner&apos;s debts. 

On cross-examination it appeared that, with regard to 
the other sums collected for the Society, which the prisoner 
had in his hands, it would be his duty to pay them directly 
to the Society. Witness never gave the prisoner directions 
to return the money to him, in order that he (witness) might 
pay it over to the Society. The prisoner had not been 
appointed treasurer to the branch Society in Chesterfield, 
but acted as such.

^* ^ Boden contended that the money was handed over to

DEN Gareett. the prisoner for a particular purpose, viz., that of paying it 
into the savings bank. 

WiLLBSy J. — I have the Act under my eye, and I have 
an opinion that the prisoner was not a bailee within it. It 
seems to me that the bailment referred to in the statute is 
one in which the same property is to be returned, not one 
ill which different property is to be returned. It is clearly 
not larceny; for the property, as well as the possession, 
was parted with. I am clearly of opinion that no criminal 
charge can be sustained here, and that the prisoner is only 
civilly responsible. I have had the opportunity of con- 
sidering the statute lately on the Oxford Circuit in con- 
junction with my brother Byles. The prisoner was acting 
as treasurer, and the money was placed in his hands as 
such, for the purpose, first, of putting it into the savings 
bank until March, and subsequently of paying it over to 
the parent Society. I very much regret that, when an offer 
to pay the money was made before the charge, that offer 
was not accepted, and that a criminal charge, founded 
upon an ambiguous statute, was preferred against the 
prisoner (a).

The oiTence was committed some time in 1853, and a I860, 
warrant for the defendant&apos;s apprehension was granted at 
that time, but not served, the defendant having absconded. 
Subsequently, on the defendant&apos;s return after six years&apos; 
absence, the present proceedings were instituted. 

Leigh, for the purpose of showing that the prosecution 
had been commenced within twelve months after the com- 
mission of the offence (a), tendered the warrant for the 
defendant&apos;s apprehension, which was issued within a week 
after the commission of the offence charged, but never 
served for the reason stated above. 

Pollock, C. B. — I doubt whether this is a commence- 
ment of proceedings within the statute. Ordinarily there 
is no limitation of suits in criminal matters, conformably to 
the maxim, &apos;* Nullum tempus occurrit regi.&quot; Consequently, 
the only effect of lapse of time is to raise doubts as to the 
prisoner&apos;s identity. In offences, however, punishable upon 
indictment, under the stat. 9 Geo. 4, c. 69, s. 4, the prose- 
cution must be commenced within twelve calendar months 
after the commission of the offence. Can you cite any 
cases \o show that this is a commencement of proceedings, 
Mr. Leigh ? 

Leigh cited i2. v. WiUan{b), R. v. Austin {c), R. v. 
Brooks id), R. v. Phillips {e). 

Pollock, C. B. — None of those cases go to the extent 
contended for in this case. I am of opinion that the issu- 
ing of this warrant was not a commencement of proceed- 
ings within the statute. 

The jury was accordingly directed to acquit the pri- 
soner.

poned to the the 19th of July following. 

next Assizes, 

on account of Mellor^ Q.C., for the prosecution, applied to have the 
material evi- trial postponed to the next Assizes, on an aflBdavit that the 
dence. register of voters for the borough was necessary to com- 

plete the case for the prosecution ; that the said register 
was in the possession of Mr. Jeffries, toiVn clerk of North- 
ampton ; that inquiry had been made the day before for 
Mr. Jeffries, to serve him with a subpoena to produce the 
register at the trial ; that Mr. Jeffries could not be found 
on inquiring ader him at his office and house; that his 
clerk at his office had said, in answer to inquiries, that Mr. 
Jeffries was not in Northampton, that he (the clerk) did not 
know where Mr. Jeffries had gone, or when he would re- 
turn, and that he (the clerk) could not produce the regis- 
ter as Mr. Jeffries kept it under lock and key. 

Macaular/y Q.C., for the defendant, opposed the appli- 
cation, on the ground that the defendant, having been 
committed for trial in July last, the evidence for the prose- 
cution should have been prepared long before, and not de- 
layed till the last moment; that, if the register was neces- 
sary to complete the case for the prosecution, it should 
have been laid before the grand jury; and that, as it had 
not been laid before them, and the grand jury had never- 
theless found the bill, it must be inferred that the register 
was not necessary. The case for the prosecution might 
have been completed in time for the last Summer Assizes, 
had the parties who conducted the prosecution so chosen, 
and as they had not chosen to do so, the defendant ought

not to be kept in suspense, and have this trial hanging i860. 
over him any longer. 

MelloTy in reply. — The register is a pubUc document, to 
which all the voters for the borough have a right of access, 
and the prosecution was justified in supposing that it 
would be forthcoming whenever it was required. 

Pollock, C, B. — The bill was only found yesterday by 
the grand jury, and in these cases the finding of the bill is 
analogous to the joinder of issue in a civil cause. No civil 
cause can be tried without eight days&apos; notice, and if the 
counsel for the defence had applied to have the trial post- 
poned I should have granted the application, without re- 
quiring any affidavit, merely on the ground that the bill 
had only been found the day before. In this case the 
application is made by the counsel for the prosecution, but 
in my opinion sufficient ground for it has been shown. It 
is not necessary that the case for the prosecution should be 
completed previously to going before the grand jury; it is 
enough if a case of suspicion can be shown. To require all 
the evidence to be produced before the grand jury would, 
in many cases, put the prosecution to a very needless ex- 
pense. The trial must be postponed till the next Assizes, 
and the defendant discharged on his own recognizances. 

Application granted.

CASES ON THE 



I860. 




The prosecutrix proved that she missed the jewellery 
from her bed-room a week before the prisoner had entered 
her father&apos;s service, and the collars afterwards, and whilst 
the prisoner was in her father&apos;s service. 

O^Brien objected. It appears by this witness that there 
is no evidence of stealing the jewellery, and that the case, 
as regards that portion of it, must be one of receiving only, 
while, as to the collars, there is evidence for the jury of 
stealing. It follows, therefore, that in truth a count for 
stealing the collars is joined with a count for receiving the 
jewellery, knowing it to have been stolen. It is submitted 
that these counts cannot be joined together. By statute (a), 
a count for stealing may be joined with a count for re- 
ceiving the same goods, but it has never been decided that 
a count for stealing may be joined with a count for re- 
ceiving different goods. 

Stephen referred to 14&amp;16 Vict. c. 100, s. 17, as to 
election. 

O&apos;Brien. — That relates to charges of larceny only. 

WiLLBs, J. — ^That is so. This is an important point 
with reference to future practice, and I will consult the 
Chief Baron upon it. His Lordship did so, and upon his 
return observed, I think it will be more satisfactory, Mr. 
Stephen, that you should only proceed upon one of these 
charges. This is not to be taken as a final decision. 
When I get back to London I shall consult the other 
Judges upon the point; but it is not of sufficient importance 
to reserve a case upon. 

Stephen elected to proceed upon the charge of receiving 
the jewellery, knowing it to have been stolen. 

The prisoner was acquitted.

very different evidence to that in their depositions, which I 
now have before me. Should the occasion arise, I will 
reserve a case for you, Mr. Macaulay; but upon a recent 
occasion at Derby, when I reserved a case (b), the Judges 
of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, although they 
agreed with me, thought it was a question of fact only, 
which I might have decided for myself. Subsequently a 
niedical witness was called, who deposed that at the time 
the declarations were made he considered the disease to be

the deceased&apos;s recovery. 

Macaulay upon that objected to the admissibility of the 
declarations. A dying declaration must be made upon a 
belief of impending death, and that belief must be well 
founded. It is not sufficient that there is a bonsL fide be- 
lief, which is afterwards verified by a death within a short 
time afterwards, if, at the time of making the declaration, 
the surgeons are attending upon and treating the man as a 
recovering patient. A mere impression of impending death 
is not sufficient; such a feeling may change every five 
minutes. 

Stephen referred to Moseley&apos;s Case (a) as in point. 

WiLLEs, J. — It must be proved that the man was 
dying, and there must be a settled, hopeless expectation of 
death in the declarant. There does appear to have been 
such an expectation in this case, and I shall therefore ad- 
mit the declarations. They were accordingly put in and 
read (6). 

In the course of the case Macaulay proposed to question 
a witness as to statements made by him before the com- 
mitting magistrates, and which statements were contained 
in the depositions taken on that occasion. 

Stephen objected that the questions could not be put 
without first reading over his deposition to the witness. 

Macaulay. — My friend, I presume, refers to the Queen&apos;s 
Caseis)] but that, I apprehend, has been overruled by 
Act of Parliament. 

WiLLBS, J. — No. It has been decided that such a ques- 
tion cannot be put without reading over his deposition to

Subsequently^ on Macaularfs proposing to adopt the 
same course with regard to another witness, Stephen again 
objected. 

WiLLES, J.— From the depositions, which I have before 
me, I am of opinion that the question is a proper one to be 
put to this witness under the circumstances, and, although 
Mr. Macaulay cannot put the question without reading his 
deposition to the witness, the Court can do so (a). Mr. 
Macaulay will therefore be allowed to put these questions, 
as the mouthpiece of the Court, without first reading the 
depositions. 

Stephen did not claim to reply (a).

Erlb, C. J. 

Macaulay^ Mellor and Field for the plaintiff. 

HayeSf Serjt., Flowers and O&apos;Brien for the defendant. 

A witness who had attested one of the codicils was called 
on the part of the plaintiff to prove the execution of it by 
the testator. 

In cross-examination he was asked whether the hand- 
writing of the codicil was not bis own, which he denied. 
Various other writings were then put into his hands, and 
having been admitted by him, it was proposed, on the part 
of the defendant, to lay them before the jury, for the pur- 
pose of comparison of handwriting, under the Common 
Law Procedure Act of 1854, s. 27 (a). 



{a) Comparison of a disputed 
writing, with any writing proved 
to the satisfaction of the Judge to 
be genuine, shall be permitted to 
be made by witnesses ; &quot; and such 
writings, and the evidence of wit- 
nesses respecting the same, may be 
submitted to the Court and jury as 
evidence of the genuineness or 
otherwise of the writing in dispute.&quot;

but it is implied that the writings,

tlie roost convenient time will pro- 
bably be tben. In other cases, 
according to the ordinary rule, it 
will doubtless be in the discretion 
of the Judge. 

There is no limitation imposed 
in the terms of the section itself. 
One restriction is implied, viz., 
that the disputed writing must be 
relevant to the issue; that being 
implied in all the prior sections on 
the subject, as it has been often 
held to be implied in all the rules 
of evidence as to contradiction or 
confirmation. See MeMuicA v. 
CoUier, 19 L. J., Q. B. 497 ; Pal- 
mer V. Frater, 22 L. J , Exch. 32; 
or, as to the production of evidence, 
see the recent case of Beatton v. . 
Skene, 29 L. J., Exch. But, sup- 



posing the handwriting of the dis- 
puted document to be relevant, as 
here it plainly was, the case for the 
defendant being that the codicil 
was forged by the attesting witness, 
there is no restriction on the sec- 
tion as to whether the comparison 
of handwriting may be as to the 
handwriting of the witness, or of a 
party in the cause ; and whether of 
the party setting up the document, 
or the party disputing it, in confir- 
mation or in contradiction in course

(a) It is conceived that the idea 
that the jury ought not to be in- 
formed of the law as to costs is 
erroneous. So far from it, costs 
are a part of the damages, and are 
recoverable only as such; inso- 
much that, in the stat. 21 Jas. 1, 
c. 16, that if the damages in slan- 
der be under 40s., the plaintiff 
shall recover no more costs than 
damages. It has been held that 
the statute only restrains the Court 
from awarding more costs than 
damages; but the jury not being 
restrained thereby, may give what 
costs they please; Brown y, Gib- 
hont, 1 Salk. 207; Fhillipt v. 
Baron, 9 East, 304. And the very 
form of the pottea shows that, in 
contemplation of law, the jury 
assess the costs as part of the 
damages. &quot; The jurors aforesaid say 
upon their oath that the defendant 
is guilty,&amp;€., and they assess the 
damages of the plaintiff over and 
above his costs and charges by him 



about his suit in this behalf ex- 
pended to — /., and for those cosis 
and charges 40s. ;&apos;* the costs of in- 
crease being, for the sake of con- 
venience, now actually assessed by 
the master; but in contemplation 
of law being given by the jury. 
And bow can they say, in cases 
like that above, of merely nominal 
or trivial damage, whether they 
will assess the damages of the 
plaintiff on occasion of &quot; the griev- 
ances,&amp;c.,&quot; over and above his 
costs and charges, if they do not 
know whether he will have any 
&quot; costs and charges&quot; beyond what 
they assess? Supposing that if he 
will, they think that he ought not 
to have any damages &quot;over and 
above his costs.&quot; Where the jury 
asked, in an action for libel, 
whether a shilling would carry 
costs, and being told that it would, 
returned a verdict for the defend- 
ant, the Court granted a new trial, 
on the ground that they had given

CASES ON THE 



1860. Shee, Serjt.y then elicited that the costs would probably 

^^&apos;&apos;&apos;^ exceed 100/. 
Waeelin 

«« ^&apos;&apos; It was also elicited that the slander was spoken in the 

Morris. ^ ^ 

course of an angry altercation at a public-house, and in 



a verdict against the direction of 
the Judge— that they should find 
for the plaintiff in a case fit for sub- 
stantial damages — and indulged 
themselves in doing that indirectly 
which they could not do directly ; 
i. «., deprive the plaintiff of his 
costs; Ltvi v. Milne, 4 Biogh. 
201. But it was not intimated 
that the Judge had done wrong in 
telling the jury the law as to costs. 
And if the case had not been one 
for substantial damages, and the 
jury had found for the plaintiff, 
even for a farthing instead of a 
shilling, so as not to carry costs, 
there seems no reason to say that 
they would have been wrong; for 
the damages in libel are not capable 
of measurement, ( where there is no 
special damage,) and may be af- 
fected by any considerations as to 
the conduct of either party, and 
among others, by the conduct of 
the plaintiff in trying to inflict on 
the defendant the costs of an action 
for an act which did no real injury. 
Where, on the execution of a writ 
of inquiry, in an action for slander, 
the jury were incorrectly told by 
the under-sheriff that any amount 
of damages would carry costs, and 
they found for less than forty shil- 
lings, that was held no ground for 
granting a new trial, nor even for 
increasing the amount of the ver- 
dict; Graten v. Collard, 6 Dowl. 
P. C. 503. And so where, without 
such information, they gave a simi- 
lar verdict, although the plaintiff 



thereby lost his costs; Kendall v. 
H(iytoar&lt;/,5B.N.C.424. Butwhere 
in a case for substantial damages 
the jury gave a farthing, the Court 
granted a new trial ; Armitage v. 
ficr/et, 4 Q. B. 917 ; supported and 
followed in Wilson v. Hicks, 26 
L. J., Exch. 244 (where see a note 
of the reporter). And so, where 
it appears that the jury have taken 
a wrong way of arriving at a ver- 
dict, as, splitting the difference in 
a case of liquidated demand ; Hall 
V. Poyser, 13 M.&amp;W. 600. But 
where the jury had given 5/. in 
an assault, under the idea that it 
would carry costs, and, on finding 
that it did not, wanted to give 
more, the Court refused to grant 
the plaintiff a new trial ; for, per 
Bramwell, B., they had no right 
to give a verdict with reference to 
anything else than the injury sus- 
tained by the plaintiff. And there 
they wanted to give or to increase 
substantial damages merely to carry 
costs, which would have frustrated 
the statutes as to costs ; Kilmore v. 
Abdoolah, 27 L. J., Ex. 306. But 
there Pollocr, C. B., said:&lt;* There 
is no reason why they should not 
be informed of the law as to costs 
if they ask it as part of the law.&quot; 
And this, it is conceived, is the true 
view : that the jury are entitled to 
know the rule as to costs, to enable 
them to judge whether they will 
give any damages beyond the 
costs, in cases where there has been 
no real damage.

plained of which, in my opinion, are actionable, if you be- 
lieve they were spoken in the sense imputed: those sup- 
posed to impute that the plaintiff got honest officers 
dismissed to serve his own purposes, and those that he 
was dishonest in his office. If you do not believe that 
they were really spoken so as to convey those imputations, 
find for the defendant. 

But if you believe they were so understood, as reflecting 
on the plaintiff as master of the workhouse, find for the 
plaintiff. 

As to the amount of damages, that greatly depends upon 
the way in which the words were spoken, whether seriously 
or angrily in mere retaliation and irritation, and partly 
under the excitement of drink. Words spoken in that way 
would not be likely to cause so much injury as they other- 
wise might have done. And then there was the defendant&apos;s 
consent to retractation, even in writing. There was no just 
ground for demanding an apology in the newspapers for 
words merely spoken at a public-house. If you believe 
that the plaintiff really was required to bring this action to 
vindicate his character, then you may think it proper to 
give substantial damages which will carry costs. But if 
you think thai it was not so, and that the words did no 
real injury, you can find nominal damages, which will not 
carry costs. 

The jury asked what sum would carry costs. 

Erlb, C. J. — I am not aware that there is anything to 
preclude my telling you (a), but the liability to costs de- 
pends upon various statutory enactments which it is not

Pleas: 1. Never indebted. 

2. Payment 

The particulars claimed 66L upon an account extend- 
ing from October, 1852, to June, 1857; all the items 
(which were given with dates) being small, a few shillings 
at a time, and credit being given in February, 1852, for a 
payment on account of 4/. 9^. 

The plaintiff&apos;s case consisted chiefly of the defendant&apos;s 
answers to interrogatories to the following effect: — That 
from 1846 to 1858 he had in his employ a groom named 
Cotterell, and that during the whole of that period he had 
horses under Cotterell&apos;s care. That the engaging of per- 
sons to shoe or attend to the horses was attended to by 
Cotterell, who had directions and money to pay ready 
money for whatever was done. That the instructions to 
Cotterell were not to procure anything upon credit, but 
to pay ready money, and that he was supplied with ready 
money according to that arrangement; and that the de- 
fendant never gave him money for any debt incurred on his, 
the defendant&apos;s, credit; but that, in 1851, Cotterell handed 
Aim an account amountivg to 20Z. 4^. Ad, as due to the 
plaintiffs and that he^ the defendant, paid that amount by 
cheque drawn in favour of the plaintiff. That since then

he had not known who attended to his horses; and that i860, 
he had received no account of the plaintiff&apos;s until July, g avely 
1858; the groom having died in May previous. 

The plaintiff was called, and proved that upon the 
orders of Cotterell he had attended to the defendant&apos;s 
horses at Hornsey from January, 1847, to June, 1867, 
and had received payments always through Cotterell ; in 
April, 1847; in January, 1848; in February, 1849; in 
January, 1860; in February, 1861 (the payment, by 
cheque, of 20/. 4*. 4rf.); and in October, 1862. That he 
had sent in accounts annually; and had sent in similar 
accounts in 1863 and 1864, but not after that year, until 
the entire amount was sent in July, 1868. 

There was some confusion about the paymeot of 4/. 9ir. 
on account in October, 1862; the amount for that year 
being much more (the average annual amount being 10/. 
or 12/.), and there was no explanation of the absence of 
accounts for the last four years (except that for a great 
part of the period the defendant had been abroad), nor 
why the account had not been sent in or before the 
groom&apos;s death, nor until more than a year after the de- 
fendant&apos;s removal from Hornsey. 

The defendant was called, and denied any authority to 
Cotterell to contract on credit ; and declared that when he 
paid the amount in 1861 he had expressly forbidden him 
to do so, and that after that time he had settled with him 
monthly for all stable expense8,and produced some vouchers 
— suggested but not sworn to be the groom&apos;s — bearing out 
that statement. Some of them included items for farriery. 

The defendant, however, could not say that he had ever 
cautioned the plaintiff not to continue to give credit ; and

^^ circumstances, whether you are satisfied that the plaintiff 

V. did th^ work on the credit of the defendant. Because, 

although the law as laid down in that case is clear, that 
the master who has once held out a servant as having 
authority to contract on credit must withdraw that autho- 
rity by notice, not to the servant, but to the tradesman^ 
and that it is not enough to do so by notice merely to the 
servant; yet there is much more than that in this case, 
and there may be notice by other means than by express 
or actual notice. And here you have the fact, that no 
accounts were sent in, even to the servant (and none to the 
master), for four years before the servant&apos;s death ; and no 
account sent in until after his death and the plaintiflTs 
removal. All these circumstances are material to the 
question, whether, in fact, the plaintiff did, after 1851, do 
the work upon the credit of the defendant; or whether, 
on other grounds, the plaintiff did not know that the ser* 
vant had no authority to pledge his master&apos;s credit. The 
plaintiff must satisfy you that he did the work on the credit 
of the defendant; and if you think he did not, find for

was apparently for delay. 

Lush answered the application upon an affidavit of the 
plaintiff&apos;s attorney, that there had been no refusal to mark 
the plan*, but only an intimation in August that there was 
no immediate necessity for so doing; that notice of trial 
had been given on the 1st March, but that there had been 
no application to have the plan marked ; that particulars 
of trespasses had been given ; that the defendant could not 
be ignorant of the places ; that the dispute was, whether

Erle, C. J. — If the land on which the fence is was not 
the plaintiff&apos;s, then there is an end of the case. If it is, then 
the defendant must prove a right of way such as to justify 
breaking down the fence and going all over the land (a). 
So that it does not appear how the marking the plan can 
be so material as that the defendant cannot go to trial 
without it; and if it were so, he should have applied for 
it before. If there were any real reason shown for refusing 
the plan -I would postpone the trial, even now, until it was

pay you to-day,a8 promised,the 2,550/*, proceeds of your bill l^oyd 
for 7,700/. negotiated by us for your account, we are willing 
to lodge with you, as security until final payment to you 
of the above amount, the cargo per Gloria, the documents 
for which will be handed to you as soon as completed ; and 
in the meantime we enclose charter-party for the same.&quot; 

On the 8th August the bill of lading arrived. 

On the 8th August Demetrio&amp;Co. wrote to Messrs. 
Labaus to the effect that, with reference to the previous 
letter regarding the deposit of the cargo of the Gloria as 
security,&amp;c., they sent the bill of lading,&amp;c., and Deme- 
trio wrote to the captain, directing him to abide the orders 
of Messrs. Labaus. 

On the same day, 8th August, Demetrio stopped pay- 
ment, and this was published in the &apos;&apos;Times&quot; of the follow- 
ing day, the 9th August. 

On the 24th August, a document, in the following 
terms, was signed by the persons called Labaus&amp;Co. : — 

&quot;Sold this day, to Miss May Martin, the cargo of 
wheat shipped per the Gloria, as per bill of lading dated 
25th July, 1869,&amp;c.&quot; 

Which was enclosed in a letter signed in the same way, 
along with invoice, making the gross amount 2,407/., and 
the nett amount (less freight and cargo) 1,899/. 

And Demetrio then indorsed to Miss Martin his letter 
to the captain, directing him to deliver to the order of 
Messrs. Labaus. 

On the 26th August, Demetrio was made bankrupt on 
bis own petition. 

The bankrupt was examined in bankruptcy, and the 
assignees imputed fraud and collusion in the transactions 
between him and the persons called Messrs. Labaus.

Jj^*&apos;*&apos;^^&apos;^ Hall&amp;Co. bought the cargo there from Miss Martin, 

vVHITMORE o D &apos; 

and Others bond fide, for 1,961/. nett. 

Demetrio^ On the 17th the ship came to Falmouth, with cargo on 
Llotd board, and the plaintiffs as assignees took possession. 

The defendant then gave the undertaking stated in the 
declaration, and which raised the question whether they 
were entitled to the proceeds as against Hall&amp;Co., the 
bond fide vendees of Miss Martin. 

The cargo was sold at Cork for the nett amount of 
2,061/., which was the sum claimed by the plaintiffs&apos; 
assignees. 

Bovill, for the plaintiffs (with him JBallantine, Serjt., 
and Hayman), opened that the whole transaction was 
a mere juggle, and that there was no such firm as 
&apos;&apos; Messrs. Labaus/&apos; and that Miss Martin was in collu- 
sion with the&apos; bankrupt to defraud the assignees of the 
cargo. 

Witnesses were* called in support of the case, showing 
that Demetrio, the bankrupt, had gone under other names, 
had engaged a boy as clerk at an office, on the door 
of which was the name of ** Messrs. Labaus,&quot; and at 
which the bankrupt himself gave directions,&amp;c. That 
Miss Martin had said she did not know the bankrupt, 
whereas she had again and again lived in the same house, 
and were intimately acquainted,&amp;c. That the indorse- 
ments,&amp;c., professedly signed by ** Messrs. Labaus,&quot; were 
really in the handwriting of the bankrupt Demetrio. And 
that Demetrio and the other parties were, between the 9th 
and 26th August, in constant communication. 

Lush (with him J. Brown and Digby\ for the defendant, 
submitted that there was no case, there being no evidence 
that the bill of lading was in the hands of the assignees or of 
the bankrupt after any act of bankruptcy; Demetrio having 
been made a bankrupt upon his own petition, on the 26th

August, without relation back to any prior act of bank- 
ruptcy (a). And that the plaintiffs had not shown that the 
bill of lading was not transferred bond fide and for valu- 
able consideration after that day. 

Erlb, C. J.y declined to stop the case. 

Lnsh^ for the defendant, admitted that the bankrupt had 
defrauded his creditors in the transaction, having made 
away with the cargo before his petition, and done so de- 
signedly, to prevent the operation of the bankruptcy upon 
the transaction. But he contended that it was immaterial 
whether the sale was to Labaus (whom he represented as a 
real firm) or to Miss Martin, but that it was sufficient that 
the purchase by her and the sale to Hall&amp;Co. (the real 
defendants) were equally bon&amp;fide and for valuable con- 
sideration. 

That the assignees should have disaffirmed the sale to 
Miss Martin before the sale to Hall&amp;Co., according to 
the doctrine of White v. Garden {b)] that not having done 
so the title of Hall&amp;Co. was indefeasible by the prior 
fraud ; and that therefore the plaintiffs were not entitled to 
the proceeds. 

He also took the point that the Factors Act applied to 
protect Hall&amp;Co. ; Miss Martin having been, at all events, 
a person entrusted with the bill of lading,&amp;c., by the true 
owner, whether Demetrio the bankrupt or Labaus&amp;Co, 

He called Miss Martin, who appeared to have been a 
person of some property, and she swore that she had made 
the purchase from the bankrupt, and paid the price in cash, 
for which she presented his receipt. 

Hall was also called and proved that the purchase by Hall&amp;Co. was bond fide, they having bought through respecta- 
ble brokers in the ordinary course of business, and at the 
market price of the day (and of this there was no doubt).

the property fraudulently to &quot;Labaus,&quot; yet, if before his 
bankruptcy there was a fton^ ^6 purchase from &apos;&apos;Labaus/&apos; 
by Miss Martin, she and her transferees, Hall&amp;Co., 
would be protected (a).

Parry, Serjt., and Barnard for the plaintiff. 

Lush and Sumner for the defendant. 

The plaintiff, in September, 1857, had been engaged to 
obtain advertisements for the defendant&apos;s paper, the ** Medi- 
cal Circular&quot; (then established for some years); the plaintiff 
asked for a salary, but this was not acceded to, and he was 
told that instead of salary he should have twenty per cent, 
commission ; that what he brought should be his own, and 
that he should have his renewals as &apos;Hong as they continued/&apos; 
which the learned Judge took down as meaning as long as 
the plaintiff and defendant should continue together, and 
so it seemed to be taken. This commission was to be paid 
on every advertisement at the time of insertion each week, 
and he was paid accordingly. The defendant had issued 
a circular, mentioning the plaintiff as his agent for adver- 
tisements. 

In 1858 disputes arose between the parties as to adver- 
tisements which were not paid for, and for which the de- 
fendant claimed to have return of commission. 

On December 28th, 1858, the plaintiff was told, by the 
defendant&apos;s order, that no more advertisements would be 
taken from him ; that he was to have no &quot; renewal orders,&quot; 
and to do no further business with the paper. The plaintiff 
admitted that. he had been &quot; paid in full all his commission 
to the end of the year.&quot; But he added that the defendant 
had continued to insert advertisements of his procuring 
after his dismissal ; no question, however, was asked as to 
the number or nature of advertisements so inserted after dis- 
missal, though he stated that he had given defendant a list 
of the advertisements he claimed as his, to the number 
of 120. 

The plaintiff&apos;s case was rested on the first count, and he 
stated on examination that he claimed to be paid commis-

It appeared that he collected advertisements for other 
papers. 

He admitted that in the middle of October be had been 
told that bis advertisements would only be received &apos;&apos;a few 
weeks longer.*&apos; 

A witness was called to prove that it was customary to 
employ canvassing agents on such terms as the plaintiff 
had stated, and that it was considered that they were en- 
titled to reasonable notice before dismissal ; but 

WiOHTMAN, J., held the evidence not sufficient (a); 
and this being the plaintiff&apos;s case, 

Lush, on behalf of the defendant, submitted that there 
was no evidence of the contract, and that on the agree* 
ment for commission there arose no implication of an em- 
ployment for any particular time. 

WiGHTMAN, J., was of that opinion. 

Parry, Serjt., applied for leave to amend by adding a 
count for commission. 

WiOHTMAN, J., declined, and directed a nonsuit; the 
plaintiff to have liberty to move to enter a verdict for the 
plaintiff if there were any evidence to go to the jury, and 
if the verdict were so entered the amount was to be settled

XHE prisoner was indicted for the wilful murder of her 
female child. It appeared that the child was found dead 
at seven o&apos;clock in the evening, in a linen bag in the 
prisoner&apos;s bed-room, the after-birth and navel-string were 
in the bag with it. 

H, Mills, in opening the case for the prosecution, 
said, that if the jury should not think there was suf- 
ficient evidence to satisfy them that the child was born 
alive and had died by the hands of the prisoner, they 
would then have to consider whether she was not guilty of 
manslaughter. He should prove that the prisoner had 
already had one child, and she could not, therefore, be 
ignorant of the signs of labour. It would also be proved 
that the prisoner was on her bed at five o&apos;clock, two hours 
before the body was discovered, and was asked by her 
mistress whether she was pregnant, which she denied. If, 
therefore, the jury thought that she knew she was about 
to be delivered, and that she wilfully abstained from taking 
the necessary precautions to preserve the life of the child 
after its birth, and the child died in consequence of that 
criminal neglect, then the prisoner would be guilty of 
manslaughter.

proposition? I never heard such a doctrine laid down

reserved price not being bid for her, she was bought in by 
the owner. Afterwards the plaintiff instructed the de- 
fendants to put her up peremptorily for sale on the 8th 
September, the reserved price being fixed at 2,926/. The 
ship was accordingly so put up, upon the usual conditions, 
for sale : inter aUa, that the highest bidder should forth- 
with sign the contract and pay a deposit There were 
several biddings until the ship was run up to 2,900/., when 
a person, unknown to the defendants, bid 2,925/., and then 
another person, also unknown to them, bid 2,950/., and 
the ship was knocked down to him. He gave the name 
of ^ Shaw k Co., Bristol,&quot; whom the defendants thereupon 
announced as the purchasers, and then they asked him 
to come forward and sign the contract 

The pretended purchaser came to the defendant&apos;s clerk, 
who attended the sale, and excused himself from doing so 
until, in half an hour, be would pay the dtpodU The de* 
fendants were then engaged in the sale of another ship, 
and it was the duty of the clerk to note down the biddings 
and fill in the contracts, and he wrote down the name 
Shaw k Co« as the purchasers. The plaintiff, who was pre- 
sent at the sale, came forward and asked the buyer&apos;s name, 
and whether it was &apos;&apos; all right,&quot; to which the defendants 
and their clerk replied, that they supposed so, telling him 
at the same time what had happened. But the pretended 
purchaser never appeared, and could not be discovered. 
The ship wa« afterwards sold by the plaintiff for 2,600/., 
and he claimed from the defendants the difference between 
that sum and 2,950/., viz. 350/. 

The defendants w^re called, and stated that it was not 
unusual for a purchaser, who happened not to have money 
in his pocket to pay the deposit, to be allowed to go 
away to procure it, on a promise (as in this case) to re- 
turn promptly and pay it, and that sometimes the pur- 
chaser was allowed to withdraw for that purpose without 
signing the contract

But it appeared that this was when the purchaser was 
not unknown (as in this instance he was) to the auctioneer, 
or left an address, known to be real, in London, 

Now, it was admitted, that the usual course was to till 
up the contract and tender it for signature immediately. 

As to damage the defendants gave evidence to show, 
that they could have sold for more than 2,600Z., if the 
plaintiff had not fixed a reserved price so much higher. 

Erle, C.J. (to the jury). — The question is, whether you 
think that there was a breach of duty — that is, a want of 
due care, in letting the purchaser go away without signing 
or paying, and without declaring the bidding to be void, 
and putting the ship up again for sale instanier. By the 
conditions of sale (a) the purchaser was to pay a deposit 
immediately^ in order to bind the bargain, and in case of 
default, the auctioneer to re-sell. Was there a want of due 
care in not asking the purchaser to pay the deposit, and in 
case he did not do so, taking that course at once ? If so, 
find for the plaintiff. As to damage, consider what the 
plaintiff has really lost by the first sale being abortive. 

Of course it is not to be assumed (but rather the con- 
trary) that if the defendants had asked for the deposit, 
they would have got it. Most likely the pr6tended pur- 
chaser would have excused himself and gone away. But 
then the defendants might, and it is to be assumed woidd^ 
have put the ship up for sale again, and sold to the next 
bidder, perhaps for more than 2,600/., but it might have 
been for less than 2,925/., and there is evidence that more 
than 2,600/., though less than 2,925/., could have been 
obtained for the plaintiff before. What, then, was the real 
loss to the plaintiff, if any, from the neglect of the defend- 
ants? If you believe there was a breach of duty, but no 
real injury, find for the plaintiff for nominal damages (b).

got any less for his ship than he

JL RESPASS for false imprisonment. 
Plea : not guilty by stat. 7&amp;8 Geo. 4, c. 30. 

Collier f Q.C., and Prentice, appeared for the plaintiff. 

Pigoltf Serjt., and Smith, for the defendant. 

The defendant, it appeared, was a farmer, occupying a 
farm called Portobello-fields, near Kensington, as tenant 
to two ladies named Talbot. One of those fields adjoins 
the Great Western Railway, and it appeared that the rail- 
way company had staked out some land two or three years 
ago in one of those fields twenty-nine feet parallel to the 
rails, which they had some contract or agreement with the 
Misses Talbot to take. On the 10th of June last year, 
when the grass was high, two labourers, sent by the Gieat 
Western Railway Company, proceeded to put back the 
post and rail fence in a line with the stakes or pegs driven 
into the field m the occupation of the defendant, and in 
order to find the pegs and measure out the ground accu- 
rately, it was necessary for them to cut a sward of the 
grass, and for this purpose they borrowed a scythe of the 
plaintifT, who lived close by, and who keeps a horse and 
cart to carry oat laundresses&apos;s linen. The plaintiff lent

they had authority for what they did ; and the men in re- 
turn for his civility to them gave him the grass they had 
cut for his horse, which the plaintiff was carrying away in 
a sack, when the defendant, accompanied by his son, came 
up to see what they were about. He had seen the men 
measuring in his field the day before and had demanded 
their business there, and they had referred him to the office 
of the Grreat Western Railway Company. On seeing the 
plaintiff walk off with a sack of his grass, the defendant 
gave information to the police, and next day had the plain- 
tiff taken into custody on a charge of stealing his grass. 
He was first taken by the direction of the defendant&apos;s son 
to his father&apos;s house, which was half a mile out of the way 
to the police-office, and then to the Kensington police- 
station, where, after being detained some houra, the charge 
was dismissed ; and for this arrest and imprisonment the 
present action was brought. 

Btlbs, J. — Before I nonsuit the plaintiff, show me the 
section of the statute under which you justify. 

Smith drew attention to the 41st section of the 7&amp;8 
Geo. 4, c. 30, to which the margin of the plea referred, 
which required notice in writing of the action and the 
cause thereof to be given to the defendant one calendar 
month at least before the commencement of the action. 
This had not been done. Then sect. 22 provided, that &quot; if 
any person shall unlawfully and maliciously destroy or 
damage with intent to destroy any cultivated root or plant 
used for the food of man or beast, or for medicine,&amp;c., 
growing in any land open or inclosed, not being a garden, 
orchard or nursery ground, every such offender, being con- 
victed thereof before a justice of the peace, shall, at the 
discretion of the justice, either be committed to the com- 
mon gaol or house of correction, there to be imprisoned 
only or to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for any 
term not exceeding one calendar month,&quot;&amp;c. 



SITTINQS^-COMMON PLEAS. 

CoZ/ter.&apos;-— The charge u for stealing and not for oom- 
mittiog a malicious injury to growing crops. It is not 
under the statute at all. 

Btlbs, J.y thought there w«9 a manifest difference be- 
tween the charges of injuring property and stealing pn&gt;^ 
perty. The defendant was pursuing the plaintiff as a thief. 
He was bound by the sort of charge he then made, which 
was not within the statute pleaded. He thought the de- 
fendant should have leave to amend and the plaintiff leave 
to move. 

Smith then asked leave to amend by adding the stat. 
7&amp;8 Geo. 4, c. 29, ss. 43 and 76. Sect. 43 was as fol- 
lows : — ** If any person shall steal, or shall destroy or 
damage with intent to steal, any cultivated root or plant 
used for the food of man or beast, or for medicine, Sec, or 
for or in the course of any manufacture, and growing in 
any land, open or inclosed, not being a garden, orchard or 
nursery-groundi every such offender^ being convicted before 
a justice of the peace, shall, at the discretion of the justice, 
either be committed to the common gao) or house of cor- 
rection, there to be imprisoned only or to be imprisoned 
and kept to hard labour for any term not exceeding one 
calendar month,&quot;&amp;c. 

Collier submitted that &apos;^any cultivated root or plant&quot; 
did not apply to common grass. It applied to turnips, 
carrots, potatoes, cabbages,&amp;c. 

Btlbs, J. — The defendant thought the plaintiff was 
committing an offence under this Act, and the plaintiff was 
therefore bound to give notice of action under the statute. 
The question was as to a nonsuit. He thought it right to 
mention that another question arose. The plaintiff was 
taken e^r^ra viam; he was not taken straight to the magis- 
trate at the police-office, but to the defendant&apos;s house, 
which was half a mile out of the way. On this ground, he 
thought the plaintiff must have a verdict They must both

1860. go to the jury, and he would allow both to move, and re- 
serve the point as to a cultivated plant being within the 
meaning of the statute. 

Pigott saidy the plaintiff ought to have new assigned 
as to the extra viam, 

Btles, J., thought not; the plea was not guilty by 
statute, though if he had been asked for leave to plead 
specially he should have allowed it. He thought it was 
all one trespass, and that the plaintiff need not new 
assign. 

Pigott then addressed the jury for the defendant. As to 
the taking of the plaintiff out of the way to the defendant&apos;s 
house, that was to the plaintiff&apos;s advantage, to get the 
matter there settled if possible ; and, with regard to the 
arrest, the defendant was the occupier of the field and 
knew nothing of the Great Western Railway Company&apos;s 
contracts with his landlady. The field was in his occupa- 
tion and he paid rent for it, and had a right to the crop of 
grass growing upon it. He was under notice to quit, but 
that notice did not expire till Michaelmas. Those who 
went, therefore, into his meadow were trespassers, and 
when he saw several men cutting a sward of grass in his 
field, and the plaintiff walking off with a sackful of the 
grass on his shoulders, he believed him to be stealing it, 
and very naturally gave him into custody. 

Collier^ in reply, said, the defendant ought to have relied 
on his civil remedy, and not have perverted the criminal 
law, which he said he had done because of an old grudge 
against the plaintiff. 

Bylbs, J., in summing up, told the jury the first ques- 
tion was, had the plaintiff any right to take the grass. 
The defendant&apos;s counsel told them it belonged to the occu- 
pier of the land. But it was one thing to say that a man 
was a trespasser and another to say he was a felon. The 
defendant charged the plaintiff not with taking the grass 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 66 

but with stealing it. Were they of opinion on the facts i860, 
proved, that the plaintiff took the grass feloniously; if they 
were not of that opinion the justification failed. The last 
act of parliament referred to said, you might arrest a man 
whom you found stealing, provided you ** immediately&quot; 
arrested him ; and if you do arrest and commit a mistake, 
honestly believing that the man you arrest did steal, al- 
though he did not, yet you are justified, but the arrest 
roust be &quot; immediate.&quot; Did the defendant really be- 
lieve the plaintiff did steal, though you should think 
he did not ? He should not trouble them with the 
question, whether &quot; any cultivated plant&quot; meant grass. 
Then there was another question ; it might be that the de- 
fendant was justified, supposing he had only sent the 
plaintiff to the lock-up, but he sent him in a different di- 
rection. It might be that he was justified altogether, and it 
might be that he was a trespasser ab initio. Suppose the 
arrest to be justified, but not the taking out of the way, 
what damages would they give for that ? and lastly, sup- 
posing the whole trespass not to be justified, what da- 
ntages would they give for that? They must find whether 
the plaintiff was stealing the grass ; and, secondly, whether 
the defendant believed that he stole the grass, and bond 
fide put the criminal law in force against him. 

The jury found the plaintiff did not steal the grass; and 
they considered the defendant must have known that he 
was not stealing it, and gave 40«. damages for the trespass 
extra viam, and lOZ. damages for the trespass and false 
imprisonment, if not justified in point of law (a).

The counsel for the plaintiff appealed to the nisiprius

5th May, and

cauie of action and the damage; 
for a jury may often, and indeed 
generally, give prospective damagei ; 
as in the very caae of dismiual of a 
servant, when the action may be 
brought before the period for which 
he was retained, and full damages 
recovered for the whole period; 
Goodman v. Pocock, 19 L. J., 
Q. B. 410. But though the vari- 
ance will be always material, it is 
probably amendable where it does 
not appear to be the question in 
controversy between the parties, as 
it usually is in the case of credit 
unexpired. There it would perhaps 
be unamendable. 

(6) The Court was moved, but 
the ruling upheld, and a rule was 
granted, chiefly on the ground that 
the writ had been improperly 
altered by the plaintiff&apos;s attorney. 
The pracipe was for the 5th of 
May, the writ was dated errone- 
ously March ; but the stamp, which 
is always dated, only it had been 
erased, would have shown the true 
date. The Court will not permit a 
plaintiff to retain a verdict upon a 
record which has been improperly 
altered by him, for the very reason 
that at the trial it is taken as con- 
clusive; Tucker v. Neale, 1 Exch. 
Rep. 468. 



amended so as to accord with the 
pracipe; Kirk v. Dolby, 6 M.&amp;W. 636. And an error in the 
copy would be merely irregularity 
in the copy, which will not make 
the service even irregular ; Hasker 
v. Jarman, 1 C.&amp;M. 408 ; and 
see Gibson v. Vorley, 26 L. J., Q.B. 
79. 

(o) The point, to be material, 
must arise on the evidence. Even 
where the record in an action of 
slander stated that the writ issued 
on the 4tli of June, and that the 
words were spoken on the 27th, it 
was held that there was no ground 
for arresting ihejudgment ; the date 
of the slander, as to law, not being 
material; Steward v. Lay ton, 3 
Dowl. 430. But that a cause of 
action appearing on the evidence 
not to have arisen before suit, is 
always a material variance, as in the 
case of credit unexpired, Paul v. 
Tod,^5 L. J., C. P. 177 ; or of title 
in ejectment not completed before 
action, vide supra, p. 57, although 
two distinctions must be borne in 
mind — the distinction between the 
cause of action and the evidence of 
it ; for facts occurring after action 
may prove a cause of action be/ore;

But the defendant admitted, that after telling the plain-

plaintiff to send the workmen in to put up gas-fittings (a). 

Pollock, C. B. — Is there any authority showing that the 
general principle of law applying to agents for the sale of 
goods does not apply to agents for the sale or letting of 
lands ; viz., that if they are known in and carry on the 
business, their acts in the course of their employment bind 
their principals, even although beyond their express autho- 
rity? 

No such case being cited (6), but Fuller v. Wilson (c) 
being cited. 

Pollock, C. B. — In regard to the sale of goods, if a 
horse dealer send his servant to market to sell a horse, and 
the servant, contrary to his authority, warrants the horse, 
the dealer will be bound by it, and so if he sells on credit, 
though told to sell for cash(rf}. Fuller v. Wilson{e)

way towards it. (To the jury.) Substantially, the question i860, 
for you is whether the plaintiff became tenant to the de- 
fendant by what passed between him and the defendant&apos;s 
agent. The authority of an agent in many cases goes be- 
yond his actual authority, as in the cases I have mentioned ; 
and so in many other cases, where an agent, exceeding his 
private instructions, nevertheless binds his principal. It 
would be more satisfactory to be able to base my ruling 
upon some decided case, applying this principle to the case 
of an agent for the letting of land, for, if it did apply, then 
clearly, whatever the directions of the defendant to his 
agent, the defendant would be bound by the act of his 
agent in letting the plaintiff into possession on certain 
terms. But here it will be safer to ask you whether the 
defendant actually authorized his agent to let the plaintiff 
into possession, or sanctioned his being let into possession, 
without or before bis agreeing to the terms he embodied 
in the written agreement? If so find for the plaintiff.

The prisoner made a statement. 

And was found guilty (a). 



Mamzamo. 



(a) The statement of a prisoner 
at the time of the transaction, or 
of his arrest, will be admissible in 
his favour, and if a declaration of 
his is put in on the part of the 
proMCUtion, of course the whole 
must be looked at, and anything in 
his Jawntr will be considered by 
the jury as part of the evidence. 
And the prisoner had always, at 
common law, and if he had, coun- 
sel has now, a right to address 
the jury and make any statements 
of the facts he pleases, (running 
the risk of its being in accordance 
with the facts proved by witnesses,) 
in order to raise a defence, by sug- 
gesting any reasonable hypothesis 
consistent with innocence. Nor 
does there seem any reason why 
his couiuei, if he have any, should 
not be in the same position, and 
practically they are so, and do 
suggest, by way of hypothesis, 
views of the facts, which it is 
understood are derived from the 
statements of the prisoner. [No- 



thing sworn by the prisoner can be 
admissible for or against him, R. 
V. Pikesbyt 9 C.&amp;P. 124, so that 
it is not as matter of evidence, other- 
wise than as admissions, that any 
statements of his are receivable.] 
But then, strictly speaking, when 
a man has counsel he has no righi 
to address the jury, and hence the 
decision of the learned Judges in 
the above case; which, on the one 
hand, it is conceived consistent with 
legal principle, was in that view, 
rather as to a matter of indulgence, 
because the prisoner had counsel. 
If he had defended himself, he could 
certainly have made any statement 
he pleased ; and so could his counsel 
for him. But they probably thought 
it would have more force, coming 
directly from him. See R. v. 
Hainet, Vol. I. p. 86, and R. v.

1860. The valuation then followed, arranged in double series 

^^T^^^*&quot;^ of columns, classing the various trees as &quot; large*&apos; and 
9. &quot; small/&apos; but there were no figures under the head ** small/&apos; 

&apos; and in point of fact the plaintiff&apos;s assistant, who had 
made the valuation, admitted that the small and large 
trees were counted together, down to mere saplings. 
Tliere were separate headings for &quot;poles&quot; and &quot;under- 
wood/&apos; but the plaintiff admitted that saplings were not 
either poles or underwood, neither were they timber, in 
the strict and proper sense of the term, but he contended 
that they came within the meaning of the plaintiff&apos;s order, 
as given to him. 

One of the witnesses for the plaintiff stated that 
*&apos; timber&quot; meant strictly trees of six inches diameter or 
two feet in girth (allowing for the irregularities of shape), 
and that a simple order to &quot;value the timber&quot; on an 
estate would be so construed, but that if he received 
such an order as the plaintiff had received in writing he 
should have asked an explanation, and on receiving such 
an explanation as was afforded by the accompanying con- 
versation, he should have &quot; valued everything down to 
6^.&quot; (the plaintiff did not appear to have valued anything 
among the trees lower than U. or Is, 6d.) 

For the defendant witnesses were called, who gave the 
same definition of timber, but stated that if the conversa- 
tion recounted by the plaintiff had taken place, they should 
have deemed themselves only entitled to value timber pro- 
perly so called. 

Pigottj Serjt., submitted that, when he had shown the 
sense in which the word timber was generally understood, 
no parol evidence could be allow^ed to affect the written 
order, which he contended contained the terms of the 
contract, and could not be varied by parol {a).

CocKBUBN,C. J.— There may be great doubt as to that, i860, 
and I am not aware that I should be able to say what is „ 
the meaning of the word &quot; timber/* or that it has any v. 

legal meaning, as regarded a particular size of wood, 
unless evidence were given to show the sense in which 
the word is generally used (a) ; when thai is ascertained, 
then arises the question (&amp;), whether the parol evidence 
of the plaintiff as to the conversation which took place 
between him and the defendant should be allowed U&gt;control the sense in which the word is usually understood. 
Now, as to that, I do not see that the plaintiff&apos;s evidence 
at all varies the sense in which, according to the defend- 
ants evidence, the term &apos;&apos; timber&apos;* is usually understood. 
For the tenant for life could properly only cut timber, and 
the phrase &quot; every stick,&quot; may have meant every &quot; stick 
of limber.&quot; 

The case for the defence was, that the valuation was 
not a valuation of timber at all ; that it was not what the 
defendant had desired and ordered, and that not only on 
that account but also as being grossly incorrect, it was 
wholly worthless, and was rejected as being so. 

Upon that latter point the evidence for the defendant 
was strong, showing that in all the instances tested the 
valuation was wrong to the extent of forty or fifty per 
cent., while the defendant&apos;s skilled witnesses agrees, that 
even a ** rough estimate&quot; to be of any value at all, should 
be within ten per cent, of the true value.

1S60. After the ease was closed the defendant was not called. 

Whittt Cockburn, C. J, (to the jury). — The great question is, 

what is the meaning of the word ** timber&quot; as used by the 
parties ? Now, as to that, even taking the plaintifTs evi- 
dence as to the expression used by the defendant prior to 
the written order, they do not appear to me to vary the 
terms of that order at all. It could scarcely be fairly 
intended that a tenant for life should strip the estate of 
every particle of wood ; the fair and probable inference, 
therefore, from the defendant&apos;s informing the plaintiff of 
the fact, that he was tenant for life, is rather that be 
meant only timber properly so called to be cut. And as 
to the sense in which the word is ordinarily understood, 
both the defendant&apos;s witnesses and the plaintiff&apos;s are 
agreed. Taking that, then, to be the sense in which the 
word was understood — if you think it was so understood 
by the parties — then the defendant has not had what he 
ordered ; for in this valuation the saplings are mixed up 
with the trees, the small trees with the large, so that the 
defendant cannot tell from this valuation what is the value 
of the timber he could cut. If you think so, then find for 
the defendant. And even if you think otherwise, on that 
point, there is another ground on which the defence is 
rested, viz., that the valuation was so grossly incorrect as 
to be of no value at all. If you think so, find for the de- 
fendant. Did the defendant leave the plaintiff to under- 
stand that the whok of the wood was to be valued, or only 
the timber properly so called ? And even if he did, was 
the valuation such as he might reasonably expect, or was 
it so bad as to be worthless ?

Telegraph.&quot; In the early part of September the plaintiff 
published a printed handbill in reference to his business. 
The defendant was the proprietor of the &quot; Daily Telegraph.&quot; 
In September Mr. Alderman Humphery took occasion, 
when presiding at the Guildhall Police Courts to draw 
attention to the handbill in question; and on the 14th 
September there appeared in the &quot; Daily Telegraph&quot; the 
paragraph which was the subject of the present action. 

To prove the publication a witness was called, who pro- 
duced a copy of the declaration filed at Somerset House of 
the ownership of the paper being in the defendant, and had 
made a copy of the declaration by order of the plaintiff&apos;s 
attorney. 

John Ellis Paris, the plaintiff in the action, had pur- 
chased a copy of the &quot; Daily Telegraph,&quot; of the 14th Sep- 
tember, and also one of the 15th, and gave them to his 
attorney. They were not in Court They were in his 
attorney&apos;s possession last night, but plaintiff believed he 
had since lost them. 

Lawrence proposed to put in popies of the libels. 

James objected to the reception of secondary evidence. 

Ribion then called a clerk to the plaintiff&apos;s attorney, 
who said, he gave me the whole of the papers in this case. 
Last night I went round to subposna the witnesses, and 
read the libels to them. On my return home I lost both 
the papers containing the libels. 

Ribton submitted he had given evidence that entitled 
him to give secondary evidence of the libels. 

James still objected. 

The witness was recalled, and, in answer to questions put 
by the learned Judge, said he was conversant with these 
matters, and had made the necessary inquiries with re- 
ference to the proprietorship, and who was the registered 
printer and publisher of the &quot; Daily Telegraph.*&apos; 




SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 73 

Erle, C. J., said he would receive the secondary evi- i860, 
dence (a) and give James leave to move. 

Ribton, before giving secondary evidence, called the de- 
fendant&apos;s solicitor, who had copies of the papers in Ck)urt| 
but he had not been subpoenaed by the plaintiff to give 
evidence, and he declined to produce the paper. 

Erlb, C. J. — Has that document you have brought into 
Court come into your possession as the defendant&apos;s attor- 
ney, and do you hold it as such for his interest ?— Witness : 
Yes, my Lord. 

Erlb, C. J. — ^Then, my opinion is that the witness has 
no right to produce the papers as between himself and 
client (&amp;). 

Ribton. — Does your Lordship hold that the copy of the 
papers is in the nature of a private communication between 
the attorney and his client ? 

Erlb, C. J.— As at present advised, the attorney for the 
defendant* having possession of the document, for his 
client&apos;s use, he is not liable to be called on to produce his 
papers and lay them open to the other side. 

Secondary evidence of the libels was put in and read. 

But afterwards a clerk in Somerset House produced a 
copy of the &apos;&apos; Daily Telegraph *&apos; of the 14th, and also the 
15tb September, containing the alleged libels. The copies 
were put in. 

The plaintiff was then recalled, and said he was a rag 
merchant and marine-store dealer, carrying on business at 
Clapham, and dealt in the articles enumerated in the hand- 
bill. The bill produced was first put into circulation be-

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — I need do no more than refer 
you to the articles, to show that the articles are defamatory 
and tended to bring the plaintiff into ridicule and con- 
tempt; for they impute to the plaintiff that he gave great 
facilities for dishonest servants to bring the fruits of their 
dishonesty to a profit, and that he holds out great tempta- 
tions and encouragement to servants who are wavering on 
the line dividing honesty from dishonesty, to step over 
and become dishonest. But then the plaintiff is not en- 
titled to recover your verdict for defamation unless he 
establishes that the defendant was actuated by malice. 
The law, however, does not require that the plaintiff should 
show personal malice or ill-will in the sense of private 
hatred, but that the defamatory publications were pub- 
lished without any of those causes which the law considers 
will justify them ; such causes excuse the publication be- 
cause they show that the party was not actuated by any 
corrupt or malicious motive in saying that which tends to 
defame the character of another. There are many actions

which has for its object not to injure the reputation of any

what 18 hostile to morality &quot; (a). If you find, therefore, 
your verdict for the defendant, it must be on the principle 
so laid down. The plaintiff says that in this case the de* 
fendant has not excused the publication. The plaintiff 
says that he carries on a lawful trade, and that there was 
nothing in his handbill that held out to the world that he 
will connive at or sanction dishonesty in any way. The 
defendant, in his articles, says that the handbill so disse- 
minated has the tendency that he has imputed to it, and 
it appears to me that your consideration will be confined 
entirely to the application of the principle I have men- 
tioned. The article with reference to Alderman Humphery 
has nothing added by the editor to the remarks of the 
magistrate; and in the article of the 15th, in which the 
tendency is imputed, I can find no single word directly or 
by implication disrespectful to the plaintiff as a private 
individual or as a member of society. I do not find a word 
said against him as an individual stepping aside from the 
honest part of the community, and wilfully going with the 
dishonest, or going beyond the tendency of the handbill ; 
but, had the defendant said one word against him with 
reference to the plaintiff&apos;s private life, or his mode of 
managing his business, I shouM have felt myself bound 
to say there was no excuse of publication. Then, if Paris

honesty, and holds out a temptation to servants to depart 
from their duty, it may be the editor will be able strictly 
to excuse before a jury the remarks he has made, if in 
their judgment they are well founded and wholly appli- 
cable to it. If you consider the handbill issued by the 
plaintiff has the dangerous tendency attributed to it by 
the defendant, then the editor has done that which may be 
salutary for the community in preventing such encourage- 
ments being given, and that he has not been actuated by 
malice against the plaintiff, but from a desire, founded on 
the principles of fair dealing and honesty, to prevent such 
temptations being held out to dishonesty.

In March, the firemen took possession of the premises 
and the salvage, and kept possession until 7th October. 

The plaintiff admitted, in cross-examination, that he had 
given notice to leave the premises at Lady-day. 

In April, the plaintiff&apos;s claim, which was for a total loss 
of the stock,&amp;c., was sent in, and referred to arbitration, 
and in January, 1859, an award for a large amount was 
made. 

It did not appear that the plaintiff had demanded pos- 
session of the premises before October, or that he had 
made any claim before the arbitration in respect of the 
causes of action now sued for. 

Hawkins submitted that the action could not be main- 
tiuned, and cited Hartley v. Moxhay (a). 

Parry f Serjt, contended that there was no right on the 
part of insurers to enter upon the premises without the 
leave of the insured, and possess themselves of the premises

1860. CocKBUKK^ C. J. — The question whether such an action 

can be tuaintained does not arise in this case, for there is 

DO plea as to the time before the 25th March, except pay*&quot; 

(Secreta^ of ment ioto CSouit, which being speci(icaUy applied to all the 

Fire*Asiurance ^*y® before that date, admitted trespasses on those days (a), 

Company), and leaves it a mere question of damage. But if it were 

not so, I shall not determine now, for the first time, that 

the action will not lie. 

For the defendant, the arbitrator was called to prove 
that the plaintiff had claimed the full value of the goods, 
from which was deducted the value of the salvage he bad 



Itw to the insurance company to 
enter and temporarily occupy the 
premises for a similar purpose, and 
perhaps for the purpose of salvage. 
But whether to exclude the owner 
or not would be a more difficult 
question. For it is a question 
whether, even under a distress, the 
landlord can exclude the tenant

declaration charged an expulsion, 
and the plea up to the 25th of 
March admitted an expulsion, xide

beyond that date, the defendants 
relied on the doctrine that a tenant

terminated, and he not having re-

(fl) See Perren v. The Mon-

L. J., C. P. 162; where it was 
held, that, though in a general count, 
the plea of payment into Court 
admits no cause of action (beyond 
the amount paid in), it is other- 
wise as to a special count. And 
according to the priuciple of other 
cases, MorriM y. Jonet, I Q. B. 
Rep. 397, it should seem that if the 
plea is specifically applied, it may 
have the same effect. It has in- 
deed been held, that the plea of 
payment into Court cannot have 
special allegations as to matters of 
fact affecting the validity of the de- 
fence; Key V. Thimbleby, 6 Exch. 
692; 20 L. J., Exch. 292; Norwood 
V. Pitt, 28 L. J., Exdi 212; but 
there is nothing to preclude the plea 
from being specifically applied Co 
any portion of the claim, and the 
form given pre-supposes that it may 
be pleaded as to part of the causes of 
action. No doubt it may be pleaded 
generally as to part, merely stating 
the amount, but it may also be 
pleaded to particular acti or tres- 
passes, or the trespassing at parti- 
cular times or places; and, if so, 
admits them. See Tatlerghall v.

was, &quot;To be sold, together or in lots/&apos;&amp;c. The plaintiffs, in 
answer, wrote, enclosing their scale of charges by commis- 
sion, and stating that they charged the commission if the 
estate was sold before, at, or within six months after the 
time of auction, and if not sold within that period, then 
their charges would be a fee of thirty guineas, exclusive of 
expenses. The scale of charges by commission was, 1 ,000i, 
five per cent. ; up to 2,000/., five per cent, for one half and 
two and a half for the other; up to 5,000/., two and a 
half per cent; to 10,000/., two per cent.; to 20,000/., one 
and a half per cent. ; above 20,000/., one per cent It was 
added that it made no difference whether the estate was 
sold in one lot or several, the charge being on the total 
amount realized by sale. 

In October, 1864, the defendant saw the plaintiffs, and 
desired them to sell, either by auction or by private con- 
tract, intimating, at the same time, that he should continue 
his own efforts to sell. 

On the 6th November, the defendant entered into a 
contract with one Cuddon (introduced by the plaintiffs) for 
the sale of two manors (part of the estate), for 3,000/. This 
sale was rescinded by the defendant, and the manors were 
resold by him to one Wilson. 

On the 8th November, 1854, an abortive sale by auction 
took place at Hereford. 

On the 8th May, 1 855, six months after, this abortive 
attempt at a sale by auction expired. 

During the years 1856 and 1857, the plaintiffs continued 
their endeavours to sell the rest of the estate, and from time 
to time advertised the property. So, during 1858 and up 
to April, 1859, there was another abortive sale by auction, 
in London. 

In April, 1859, the defendant intimated to the plaintiff&apos;s 
that he had nearly concluded a contract of sale, and that 
further operations were to be suspended. 

In August, 1859, the sale was completed, for 13,800/. 
net. 



SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH.

III December^ 1859, the plaintiffs sent in their account 
of what the amount was, 51 7/., comprising commission on 
the 3,000/. and also on the 13,800/.; 30 guineas and the 
expenses for the abortive sales by auction in Hereford and 
London, and the expenses of advertising,&amp;c. The defend- 
ant objected to the claim on the ground that there had 
been no sale within the six months mentioned in the 
original contract (which, he contended, was the only one 
ever entered into); that, therefore, the plaintiffs could not 
charge the fee of thirty guineas, as well as expenses, for 
these two abortive sales by auction; that the sale to 
Caddon proved abortive, and the sale to Wilson was with- 
out the plaintiffs&apos; agency. The plaintiffs, on the other 
hand, contended that the original contract applied to the 
two abortive attempts at sale, and that, as to the sale by 
private contract, they were entitled to remuneration on a 
quantum meruit, and their expenses; that, as to both the 
actual sales, they were entitled to commission; that the 
sale to Cuddon having been once completed, but rescinded 
by the defendant, was not the less a sale for which they 
were entitled. 

One of the plaintiffs was now called to prove directions, 
after the six months had expired, to sell by private con- 
tract, and these directions, they contended, created new 
contracts. 

The defendant was called to show that these were only 
modifications of the original contract. 

It appeared that there were errors in the items for ad- 
vertising, reducing the claim to 533/. 

The defence was, that there was no retainer after the 
original one, and that the 400/. paid into Court covered 
the first and second sales. 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The question is, whether 
the plaintiffs are entitled only to recover upon the first 
contract or upon others. Now, if they are only entitled 
under the first, they are not entitled at all as to sale by

private contract^ for there was no sale within the six 
months. As to the sale to Cuddon, it appears to me that, 
as it was once a complete contract, and the defendant chose 
to rescind it, the plaintiffs are entitled to their commissioa 
upon it, but I will reserve that point if necessary. As to 
the first attempt, the defendant could have had no answer 
if the plaintifis had sent in their bill immediately after the 
first six months had elapsed, and there does not appear to 
be any answer to it now. As to the other attempt at sale 
by auction, probably the original contract applies. As to 
the final sale by private contract, that is not provided for 
by the original contract, and therefore it appears to come 
to a question of reasonable remuneration. But the plain- 
t\S&amp;could not (in the absence of any express contract) be 
entitled both to their fee and expenses and also to commis- 
sion. They may have it either way as you may think 
reasonable, but not in both ways. 

The jury found 65/. beyond the amount paid into Court, 
excluding the amount charged for the commission upon 
the sale to Cuddon, as to which the point was reserved ;

Hill, J.— rThere is no evidence of any demand before

was conclusive as against the de-

tent of the proviso being clearly to 
protect the person dealing with the 
wife, i^id ViApunUw being in his 
favour. But then it is conceived 
that he could not controvert it in 
any action, but should get the

tained. The witness Edwards ad- 
mitted that he had lived with her 
for five or six years; t. e., since 
1855 ; and the deposits began then, 
yet the desertion laid in the order 



was only in Sept., 1856. This was 
not observed at the trial.

ADAMS AND ANOTHBR(fl) V. YEOMAN. 

Action on a blU of exchange for 501. (dated in 1853), 
drawn by tlie defendant on and accepted by one Ramsay, 
and indorsed by one Weaver to the plaintiff. 

Pleas {inter alia): 1. That the bill, while in the hands 
of Weaver, was satisfied and discharged by Ramsay, the 
acceptor. 

2. (For a defence on equitable grounds), that Weaver 
indorsed the bill to the plaintiffs, and they received and 
always held and still hold the same as the agents of 
Weaver, and to demand and recover the amount of the bill 
for his use and benefit, and not otherwise; and that there 
was no other consideration or value for such indorsement; 
and the plaintiffs sue as his agents and on his behalf; that 
Weaver was and is indebted to the defendant in an amount 
equal to the plaintiffs&apos; claim, and that Weaver indorsed 
the bill to the plaintiffs for the purpose of preventing the 
defendant from setting off the said debt so due to him as 
aforesaid. Issue. 

J. Brown for the plaintiffs. 

Hawkins for the defendant. 

There had been interrogatories administered to the plain- 
tiffs with the view of showing that they had not given 
value for the bill. 

Weaver was called to prove the indorsement to the 
plaintiffs for valuable consideration, and stated that he was 
indebted to them at the time of the indorsement to a con- 
siderable amount. 

But it appeared from his examination that there were 
accounts unsettled between him and the defendant, and

also between him and the plaintiffs; and these matters 
of account being gone into with a view to the defences 
pleaded, 

HiLLy J.y said these were matters of account which could 
not be conveniently tried by the jury. 

J. Brown assented to this, and suggested that these 
matters might fitly and properly be referred by his Lord- 
ship to arbitration under the Common Law Procedure Act, 
1864,8. 3(a). 

HiLi«y J.9 thereupon went to consult Pollock, C. B., 
and on his return, said — ^The course which I shall pursue is 
this: I shall postpone the matters of account, trying, first, 
the other issues of fact (i), and then, unless the matters of 
account become immaterial (as they may), I shall refer 
them to arbitration, by virtue of the powers vested in me 
by the Act of Parliament. 

The cause was then tried on the other issues, but, as the 
essential allegations in the pleas could not be made out, the 
defence failed, and the jury gave a 

Verdict for the plaintiff.

which cannot be conveniently tried 
in the ordinary way, it shall be 
lawful for the Judge, upon such

such matter in a summaiy manner,

SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 98 

Monday^ the 9th, for the puqx&gt;se of obtaining the necessary i860. 
cards of admission to the theatre. Accordingly, about a 
quarter-past eight o&apos;clock on the evening of the 9th, the 
plaintiff, having been, as he said, accidentally late, called 
at the office, and saw the defendant, in the presence of one 
or two other persons employed on the paper. The defendant 
appeared to have been vexed, and told him he was too late 
to attend the opera at that hour, for that it would be half 
over by the time he got there. The plaintiff answered that 
he knew the opera well, having heard it several times. 
The defendant said that he would be too late, at all events, 
to abuse the orchestra or overture, which happened to be 
new that night. The plaintiff, a little annoyed, replied that 
he was not in the habit of writing what was not true; and 
that the defendant was ready to abuse or praise for the 
sake of obtaining advertisements. The defendant was 
angry at this, and told him to *^ leave.&quot; The plaintiff, 
going away, said he was quite willing to do so, and that if 
the defendant desired his services he must send for him. 
There was no theatrical critique in the paper for that night. 
Next morning the plaintiff wrote to the defendant that he 
was perfectly ready to attend any of the theatres in the dis- 
charge of his duty. The defendant replied that his conduct 
had been so insolent, that, in the absence of all apology, 
he must consider himself dismissed. 

Hill, J. (at the close of the case for the defendant). — 
The special plea is not proved. The first part of it then 
is not supported. Then, as to neglect, although habitual 
neglect would be a good ground of dismissal, there is no 
evidence of it, and an occasional neglect would be no justi- 
fication. So, as to behaving in an unbecoming manner, a 
single instance of insolence on the part of a gentleman em- 
ployed in such a capacity would hardly justify dismissal; 
and the plea appears by its phraseology to import that 
there were sa&gt;ernl instances of it, if not a continuous and 
habitual insolence. The plea, therefore, must clearly be 




CASES AT THE LONDON 

1860. amended, and I will allow any amendment necessary to 
try the merits of the case. To make the plea consistent 
with the evidence it must be confined to a single instance 
of unbecoming behaviour, since the rest is not proved. It 
cannot be permitted that the plea should stand in its pre- 
sent form, since, after verdict, it would be construed in a 
sense which would make it good in law, and would pro- 
bably be taken to mean that there was an habitual course 
of insolence or neglect, whereas there is no evidence of 
such a degree of misconduct. 

MundeU proposed to amend the plea in accordance with 
this view ; but 

Hawkins contended that this would make the plea bad, 
as a single instance of neglect or insolence would not be a 
good ground of dismissal, and the plea as amended might 
have been demurred to if originally so pleaded (a). 

Hill, J. — ^That is so ; and therefore if the amendment 
is made the plaintiff is to be put as much as possible in 
the same position as if the plea had been originally so 
framed, and the plaintiff had demurred. The plaintiff 
must have leave to move to enter the verdict, supposing 
the plea as amended is found for the defendant, and 
the Court think that the amendment ought not to be 
allowed (&amp;).

Sim»Ga^-auBEN*S BfiNCH. 97 

Mundett submitt^ that there was cividfince ih support ^ ^ 
of the othei* pleas. 

Hill, J. (to the jury),— There are four questions io bfe 
left ydu. 

1. Was the t)Iaintiff ready and willing to remain ih th^ 
employment of the defendant id the capacity and on th^ 
terms toentiohed in the contract? If not, you must find 
for the defendant. 

2. Was the plaintiff guilty of such insulting and insub- 
ordinate conduct as to be incompatible with the continu- 
ance of the relationship subsisting between him and the 
defendant? If so, then the defendant was justified in dis- 
thisging him, and yon must find for thb di^fendant (a). 

3. Was there any mutual consent or agreement to re- 
scind the Engagement before the defendaht&apos;s disMSSal of 
the plaihtiff ? I can see no evidence of siich ah agf^ement 
of remission, and i advide yon iioi to fihd it ds a fiict. For 
on the eyidencd M is clear that the parties met and were 
angry, dnd that thd defendant distliissed thE plaihtiff, and 
that the plaintiff never agreed&amp;^are the dismissal to rescind 
the agreement. 

4. If you find for the plaintiff, what is the damage? 
The two main questions, then, are, whether the plaintiff 

was ready and willing to remain iti the performance of his 
duty under the contract, and whether he was guilty of 
iucli insolent and insubordinate conduct as precluded the 
defendant from retaining him in his employ. 

That depends upon your view of the evidence. The 
parties met and were angry ; some angry expressions 
escaped each of theni. The defendant, according to the 
weight of tft idence, first tised provokmg words; th^ plain- 
tiff repKed in the same Way ; the defendanft desired him 
to go ; the plaintiff said he was quite ready ; and if the 
defendant desired him he must send for him. That last ex- 
pression, coupled with the letter sent the next morning,

CASES AT THE LONDON 




seem to show that he was ready tor continue in the employ. 
But next day the defendant declared that he deemed him 
dismissed. 

As to the damages, you should consider that the year 
will not expire until next March, so that the plaintiff will 
have had almost the whole of it to himself.

SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 99 

tender was based on quantities calculated by defendant&apos;s I860. 
surveyor. The contract provided that alterations or ad- 
ditions should not avoid it, but be allowed for as estimated 
by the surveyor. The work was not completed until Oc- 
tober, 1869. The account was sent in as above. The last 
item of 81/. was admitted, being entirely different work, 
quite apart from the contract as to the house. The other 
items were disputed. The main items were, 89/. for works 
different from those in the specification, as a verandah, kc; 
161/. for additions and alterations ; and 142/. for work and 
materials found to be required in excess of the quantities 
as calculated by the defendant&apos;s surveyor. The claim had 
been referred to the surveyor, who allowed a certain sum 
refused by the plaintiff. 
On the statement of the case, 

Hill, J. — As to the item of 89/. for work different from 
the specifications, it seems to be the same as the first of 
161/. for &apos;&apos;additions and alterations&quot; (for a verandah is an 
addition); and then the contract provides that they shall 
be allowed for only as estimated by the surveyor. Then, 
aa to the claim of 142/. for work and materials in excess 
of the quantities estimated by the defendant&apos;s surveyor, 
the plaintiff has, in his particulars, adopted the contract, 
claiming 1,985/. as per contract; and he cannot be allowed** 
to blow hot and cold, and say at the same time that the con- 
tract is not binding upon him. If it was framed upon the 
basis of false calculations made by the defendant, that might 
be a reason for setting aside the contract altogether (a) ;

Hawkins applied to amend the particulars.

tice of the case, but however the particulars are amended 
the case will not be altered in substance; for the contract 
is conclusive until got rid of, and it would still come within

Statute of Frauds ( Goodman v. Grif-

nerally, as to the eompletion of a 
contract, whether in writing or not, 
and whether as to pleading or evi- 
dence (Fremlin v. Hamilton, 7 
Exck Rep. 308, 22 L. J., Exch.

Rep. 185, 22 L. J., Exch. 37; 
I^rnoi V. Meek, 27 L. J., Exch. 
84); the question did seem in 
this respect to be substautially the 
same; viz., does the document 
contain all the terms of the con- 
tract Y and have they in Juct been 
Anally agreed to by both parties? 
• whether that assent be shown by 
the signature of both to the docu- 
ment, or by its being written by 
one and signed by the other, or by 
its being sent by one side to the 
other, and retained and accepted 
absolutely and without alteration, 
and acted on by both parties as 
eontainmg the terms of the agree* 
ment, which was the case in the 
above ease. There is no doubt 
thris distinction, that under the 
Statute of Frauds the agreement 
must be signed by the party tued; 
bat that is by force of the parti- 
enlar provision ; and the terms of 
the Stamp Act are: &apos;* minute or 



memorandum of agreement, whether 
the same shall be only evidence of 
a contract, or obligatory upon the 
parties by its being a written In- 
Btmment,*&apos; 55 Geo. 3, c. 184; and 
whether it is &quot;evidence of the 
contract&quot; is just a question as at 
common law under the rules of 
evidence; and the distinction 
drawn between what is evidence 
&apos;&apos;and what is obligatory from its 
being a written instrument,&quot; plainly 
impKes that the writing may be 
evidence of the contract, although 
not signed by both parties; as, 
where it is signed by one side and 
accepted by the other and acted on 
by both, provided it ie accepted 
without any variation or alteration 
as in the above case. If, indeed, 
the terms are varied from, all the 
eases show that for no purpose is it 
an agreement; or if neither party 
is bound by the document, then it 
neither excludes parol evidence 
nor requires a stamp; Ronubottoiit 
V. Tunbridge, 2 M.&amp;S. 434; Stone 
T. Dtfwla, 29 L. J., Exch. 122. 
&quot;Whether the document does con- 
tain the terms, or has been finally 
assented to, is necessarily a matter of 
parol proof, being just as if, though 
signed by both parties, the question 
is raised, whether it was intended 
to take efi^dt at once, or at all?

the general proviso, that no departures from the contract 18^0. 
shall avoid it, but be allowed for according to the estimate cok^e 
of the surveyor. The case is thus brought within the «- 

principle of Scott v. Avery (a), and the plaintiff must prove, 
as part of his ground of action, the surveyor&apos;s estimate of 
the additional claim. 

Sawkins thereupon offered to prove the surveyor&apos;s allow- 
ance of a certain sum ; no certificate or written allowance 
being expressly required, an oral allowance will suffice. 

Hill, J. — Clearly so. 

Hawkins then called the brother of the plaintiff (who 
had looked after the business), and produced the tender, as 
follows : — 

** I will undertake to complete the new buildings,&amp;c., 
in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by 
Mr. Morgan (the surveyor), for 1,985/.&quot; 

This was signed by the plaintiff alone. 

Hill, J. — You must put in the specifications, or you 
cannot go into any question of extras. 

The specifications were then produced, also 8%ned by 
Hie plaintiff . 

Hill, J. — ^Tbey must be stamped. 

Mathew urged that they did not form a contract, being 
signed by only one of the parties, and that not the party

cash lent. 

The defendant being abroad, the only witness on his 
side was his wife ; on the other hand, the plaintiff and his 
son, and another witness — the other of the attesting wit- 
nesses — proved that the debt accrued in December, and 
that the deed was not really executed until then, though it 
had been originally drawn and dated in August (a).

On the 3rd December, 1859, the defendant agreed to 
buy of the plaintiff a lot of timber, to be sent by rail ; on 
its arrival at the station he removed and re-sold the greater 
party but complained that the rest was not according to 
the contract, and ultimately refused to accept it. The 
payment for the whole was to be by bill of exchange at six 
months, and the action had been brought before the six 
months had expired. 

A bill of exchange had been sent to the defendant for 
the entire amount of the price, but had not been accepted. 

Powell, for the defence, relied on that, citing Paul v. 
jDod(a), but 

Blackburn, J. — That is no answer to account for not 
accepting the goods, where the defendant has not ac-

cepted them (provided they were according \q coatraet), for 

the very breach relied on is, that he has not accepted 

them ; and that where the payment was to be by bill, thai 

implies that he has not so paid for them, that is, has not 

accepted a bill for the entire price. It was for him to 

tender such a bill, and he not only does not do so, but re? 

fuses to do so when requested, because he refused to 

accept the whole of the goods, that is, he did not accept 

and pay for the goods according to the contract, sup* 

posing they were according to the contract. The question 

to be tried is, therefore, whether the timber was according 

to contract (a).

Lush and J, J, Russell for the plaintiffs. 

M. Chambers and Joyce for the defendants. 

On the 8th September, 1858, the plaintiffs and defend* 
ants made a contract for steam coal, of which there was a 
note in writing — ** 1,000 tons of Thomas&apos;s Merthyr coal, 
called * through and through,&apos; at 8s. 6J. per ton.&quot; 

The plaintiffs&apos; evidence was, that on a subsequent day 
they met the defendants, and the contract was altered 
thus: that there was to be the same quantity of coal (not 
saying what description by name), to be hand-picked, at 
8s. 9d. per ton. 

The bill of lading, dated 27th September, 1858, was in- 
dorsed *&apos; Carr&apos;s Merthyr Tydvil,&quot; and on the next day, so 
soon as it was seen, it was rejected by the plaintiffs as not 
being according to contract. 

The evidence for the plaintiffs was strong that the coal 
was not hand-picked (i.e. large lumps of coal picked out 
by the hand), but that it was small coal of the kind called 
*&apos; through and through&quot; (i.e. screened), and that at least a 
fourth part of it was small and almost entirely dust. 

Lush examined as to whether ** through and through&quot; 
was steam coal or fit for steam-engine purposes at all. 

JW. Chambers objected, because the first count laid the 
contract to be for ** through and through&quot; coal, so that the 
evidence would be irrelevant to the issue. 

Lush urged that the real issue between the parties was, 



108 



CASES AT THE LONDON 



1860. 

St. Loskt 

Green 
aad Othera. 



whether the coal was to be hand-picked, and any circum- 
stances tending — coupled with the fact that the plaintifis 
told the defendants the coal was required for steam par- 
poses, that *Ubrough and through&quot; coal would not be the 
proper coal — would be admissible. 

Erlb, C. J. — The question to be tried, it is quite clear, 
is, whether the coal was to be hand-picked. Any circum- 
stances tending to show that it was to be so are admis- 
sible. 

The coal was to be shipped to San Francisco, and exa- 
minations taken there were read to show that it was none 
of it &apos;^ hand-picked.&quot; Some of the coal had been re-sold 
however. 

At the close of the plaintiffs&apos; case, 

M&gt;Chambers submitted that they could not sustain 
either count. Not the first, for the original contract had 
not the word &apos;&apos; hand-picked;** nor the second, because the 
altered contract was not for ** through and througK^ coal. 

Lxtsh stated that those latter words were erroneously in- 
serted, and applied to amend. 

Erlb, C. J. — Upon the evidence, especially the exami- 
nations taken at San Francisco, it is plain that the real 
matter in controversy between the parties always was (a), 
whether the coal was to be hand-picked; therefore the 
words ^* through and through&quot; are obviously immaterial, 
and may be struck out. 

M. Chambers then contended that there was no note in 
writing of the altered contract for ** band-picked.&quot; 

EriiB, G. J. — ^Tbere was a payment, or acceptance* 

M. Chambers. — ^Tbe plaintiffs never accepted the coal 
called &apos;^Tbomas&apos;s Merthyr coal,*&apos; as laid in the first count. 

Erlb, C. J. — That only drives the plaintiffs to the second 
count, for Carr*s Merthyr coal.

-3f. Chambers, — But, as Carr&apos;s coal, it was not accepted. I860. 

Erlb, C. J. — The matter really in controversy between st. Loskt 
the parties is, whether the coal, whatever might be its greek 
other description, should be hand-picked. The words *nd Others* 
&quot;through and through&quot; are to be struck out as imma- 
terial, and for the same reason any other words of descrip* 
tion, except the word &quot; hand-picked.&quot; Whether the coal 
was Carr&apos;s or Thomas&apos;s, it should seem, did not matter, so 
that it was hand-picked. It is compulsory on the Judge 
to make all amendments necessary to raise the real ques* 
tion between the parties (a). 

Lush thereupon applied to strike out all the words in 
either count except the word &quot; hand-picked,&quot; and as that 
would make the counts identical, he proposed to strike out 
the first count altogether. 

M. Chambers objected that there were pleas to both 
counts, especially the plea to the first count as to a substi- 
tution of contract. 

Erlb, C. J. — ^That plea alleges an acceptance of coal 
not hand-picked, and therefore, according to the evidence 
yet given, is disproved; and if it should be proved, the de- 
fendants will have the costs of that issue. 

M, Chambers pressed for terms as to the amendment. 
There had been the expense of a commission to take evi- 
dence abroad. 

Erlb, C. J. — Upon the substantial question, whether 
the coal was hand-picked. 

M, Chambers pressed for costs of the amendment; but 

Erls, C. J. — I allow the amendment asked, without 
costs.

XhE declaration alleged that the defendant had let the 
premises to one A. B. as his tenant, and, at the time of 
the demise contracted that he, the defendant, would keep 
the railings, in repair; whereas he had left a railing in a 
dangerous state, for want of proper repairs, whereby the 
plaintiff had sustained an injury. 

Pleas : not guilty, and denying the alleged agreement. 

Merewether, for the plaintiff, proposed to prove by 
parol, that after A. B. became the defendant&apos;s tenant, the 
defendant agreed to the terms stated; but it appearing 
that this was by an agreement in writing (the tenant being 
already in occupation), 

Byles, J., ruled that it must be produced, as it was 
material to the issue; and might be material as to the 
cause of action ; for apart from the stipulations of landlord 
and tenant, inter se, the tenant was liable to the public, 
or to strangers ; and the agreement could not be varied 
by parol. 

Merewether then produced a document, and tendered it 
in evidence (a). 

It was an agreement, not under seal, amounting to a 
demise for five years, and it was unstamped. Being^ ob- 
jected to on that ground, 

Merewether urged that, being void as a lease, it did not 
require a stamp, and he cited Motl v. Turnage{fi\ but did 
not produce the report ; and 

Byles, J., doubted if it applied (c); and deemed the 
document now tendered an agreement requiring a stamp.

lease eUmp ; and, being void as a 
Ua$e, would only become evidence 
of the terms of tenancy, by virtue 
of subseqaent occupation. The 
document, indeed, was not put in as 
an agreement ; but, the action being 
trespass for a distress damage fea- 
tant, the sole question was as to the 
extent of the locut in quo ; and the 
document was put in, in order, by 
its description of the premises, or 
as an admimon, to show what, as a 
matter of fact, had been let : a pur- 
pose for which it was equally ef- 
fective although void as a lease, 
and so that it was put in, not as an 
operative agreement; but rather 



as an admission (see Walker v. 
Atkinton, Vol. I. p. 465) ; because 
it was not an agreement. It is 
conceived, however, that in that 
case the decision was correct, for 
the reason above pointed out, and 
because it has been always held 
that an agreement, to require a 
stamp, must have operated as such 
when executed {Clay v. Crofi, 20 
L. J , £xch. 361), whereas here it 
would only be so by subsequent 
occupation. (See Slration v« Petlity 
24 L. J., C. P. 182, and Treu v.

the case above reported is dis-

the houses ii^ ElTzabetti Street. He chiefly relied on t^e 
breach first laid in his particulars^ using the second and 
third tather in aid of it; contending that the defendant 
wad nkble either for pulling down the old wall without 
doofs, or for opening doors in tlie new one. He also applied 
the fiilst and secona breaches to the alleged renabval of a 
fe&apos;nce or palisade iicross the top of St. teeter&apos;s Place, and 
separating it from the end of the piece of land in question ; 
contending that the pulling it down opened up a way from 
St Peter&apos;s Place, ac^ross the demised land, t6 the houses 
in Elizabeth Street, or was a breach of the covenant to 
&quot; uphold and maintain&apos;* all &apos;&apos; erecti6ns&quot; in and upon the

the use of them, and only using them for his own work- 
men and materials on the occasion of repairs. Cross- 
examined, he admitted that he used a long ladder, which, 
when carried down the narrow passage, had to be turned 
round to get in at the garden doors, and being carried by 
two men, the one at the tail might possibly go a few feet 
on the soil of the land demised to his son. 

With regard to the palisade, said to have been standing 
across the end of St. Peter&apos;s Place, and to have been pulled 
down by the defendant, both he and his father swore that 
it was only a hoarding put up during the completion of the 
houses, and removed when they were finished. Moreover, 
they said that the end of St. Peter&apos;s Place always opened 
on to the demised land, and it was paved by the parish. 

Byles, J. — It was contended on the part of the plaintiff 
that there was a breach as regards certain houses on the 
opposite side of St. Peter&apos;s Place, and thrown open to the 
street, but I am not sure that it would be a breach of this 
covenant, which seems confined to communication with the 
backs of houses in Elizabeth Street; but, at all events, 
no such breach is mentioned in the particulars, and it can- 
not be relied upon. 

The breach relied upon appears to be the first, as to 
opening the back entrance; for as to the secoird, for not 
repairing the fences, the covenant does not mention fences, 
eo nomine, and the word &apos;* erections,&quot; coming afler houses, 
must, I think, be construed ejusdem generis ; at all events 
as meaning only permanent fences. 

At the close of the case, 

. Btles, J. (to the jury). — There is som^ evidence that the 
piece of land in question had become dedicated to the parish 
as a public way long before the demise, for the defendant&apos;s 
father spoke to a user of it as such for more than forty 
years ; but that is immaterial, for though there is a right of 
way the soil remains in the owner, who may deal with it in 



SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS.

any way not inconsistent with the right of way acquired ; 
and the very object of the covenant chiefly relied on, was 
to prevent a right of way being acquired over the demised 
land to the back gardens of the houses in Elizabeth Street. 
Now whether the mere opening of the doors in the wall, 
without user, would be a breach of the covenant, is a ques- 
tion I will not finally determine, but will reserve. There 
is on the part of the plaintiiF no evidence of usery and on 
the part of the defendant the only admission of user was 
the very slight admission of the probability of the roan 
carrying the ladder coming for a few moments on the de- 
mised land. The covenant, you will observe, is not merely 
not to open a way or entrance into any house in Elizabeth 
Street, but not to open it across the demised land. Has 
there been such a way or entrance ? Then, as to pulling 
down or not maintaining the fences, I doubt if the cove-

T. Chitty for the plaintiff. 

Oarih for the defendants. 

It appeared that the demise was in 1852, and that the 
defendants had taken the house next to the one demised, 
and had opened two doors in the walls between the houses, 
one soon after the demise and the other more lately : as to 
the first, there was some evidence that the plaintiff had 
seen it, or known of it, and had not objected : as to the 
second, there was no evidence of any such knowledge of it 
without complaint^ and 

WiLLBS, J., held that the equitable pleas failed, the de- 
fendants not proving as to either of the breaches any prc- 
vious knowledge and assent on the part of the plaintiff. 

As to the plates, it was contended that there was no real 
difference between &quot;house agents &apos;* and &quot;chemical and 
medical agents ;&quot; the latter term meaning that tlie defend-

houses. It was also contended, that,, as the term was still 
runningy the damages should be nominal, and only for the 
ejrpehse of replacing the walls; which, it appeared, would ^id^Anc^ar. 
not be more; than a few pounds. 

Garth likewise contended, for the defendants, that open- 
ing the doors in the wall was not a breach of cotenant to- 
repair, ftc, bot 

WiLLBS, J. — Pulling down the building to be kept in 
repair is a breach of the covenant to repair, uphold and&apos; 
maintain (a). 

At the close of the case, 

WiLLEs, J. (to the jury). — As to the first breach, I have 
already said&apos; that a covenant to repair, uphold and maintain, 
or keep in good repair, raises a duty not to destroy, the 
demised premises; and the pulling them down, wholly or 
partly, is a breach of such covenant. There is no evidence 
of any assent on the part of the plaintiff. 

As to the plates, the question is whether the business of 
a &apos;&apos;chemical and medical agent&quot; is different from that of a 
&apos;&apos; house agent.&apos;&apos; But as to this breach the damages must 
be nninute. It would be well to assess the damages sepa- 
rately (6). 

The jury found for the plaintiff; assessing the. damages 
at 25/. on the first breach, 10/. on the second..

agents. 

The cargo was of military stores, and the captain carried 



SITTINGS—CJMMON PLEAS.

a letter of instructions to the military intendant at Genoa. 

Tbe captain was now called^ and said that he also carried 
a letter to Messrs. Santa Maria&amp;Co. ; but this was denied 
on tbe other side. It was admitted, however, that he car- 
ried a &quot; card&quot; of their address. 

The defendants and Messrs. Santa Maria&amp;Co. corre- 
sponded about the ship, and the plaintiff had obtained an 
order to inspect and take copies of these letters ; which were 
given in evidence on the trial. 

The captain, in point of fact, after reporting himself to 
the military intendant, had recourse to Santa Maria k Co., 
and they cleared the ship and charged, for commission on 
the freight, 35/. ; the sum now in question ; and which, as 
they refused to deliver up the certificate of delivery of 
cargo, the plaintiff&apos;s captain had to pay, and paid under 
protest. 

The defendants had paid the plaintiff the freight less that 
sum, which the plaintiff received under protest, and on 
applying to the defendants for repayment of the 35/., they 
refused, alleging that the captain had engaged Santa Maria&amp;Co. on his own account ; the defendants referring at the 
same time to, and adopting, the statement of Santa Maria&amp;Co., which was to the effect that the ship was not ad- 
dressed to them, and that, therefore, their arrangement had 
been with the captain, and that they had acted as con- 
signees. 

The charges consisted of various items, such as pilotage,&amp;c., which it was admitted the military intendant could not 
have done. But, on the part of the defendants, it was con- 
tended that he would have got the business discharged free 
of commission. 

Parry, Serjt., proposed to ask one of his witnesses, a ship 
broker, as to the effect or import of those words, as usually 
understood, but 

Zush objected, and

posing those words are not in Uie charter, does the ship

It was admitted by the defendants that the captain was 
to be a^t liberty to employ any agent he pleased, to render 
any assistance he might require. And tbat they wrote to 
Santa Maria&amp;Ck&gt;. to do their best for the ship&apos;s captain, 
and make their own barg:ain with him as to remunieration. 

Upon the part of the plaintiff, it was contended that 
either Santa Maria k Co. were the defiendants&apos; agents— in 
that case t^ey were resppnsibljs. for their act; or they had 
not addressed the ship to an agent who would discharge 
the ship &quot; free of commission.&quot; 

Upon the part of the defendants it was cont^qded, that 
they had consigned the ship to one who would have done 
the business free of commission.

Tl^e plaintiffs were brokers in London. The defendant 

carried on business at Newcastle^ and had a clerk named 

Burness. 

In January, 1858, the defendant became acquainted, with 
one of the plaintiffs, and in March, 1859, the plaintiffs sent 
their circular to the. defendant^ addressed to him personailly, 
and from that time qntil September sent him daily their 
share list, which thqy sent to customers. 

In March, 1859, Burness wrote them letters, signed by 
him in the defendant&apos;s name, ^^ per proc* R. Burness,&quot; for 
purchases and sales of shares,&amp;c. From that time until 
September nearly 100 letters passed between the plaintiffs 
and Burness, these being always addressed to the defend- 
ant ; his being signed in the defendant&apos;s name, **per proc, 
R. Burgess.&quot; Several telegraphs were sent by the plaintiffs, 
addressed to the defendant, on the subject of such transac- 
tions, and answered in the same way. And several sums 
remitted by the plaintiffs to defendant were credited to him 
in his pass book. These remittances were by the plaintiffs&apos; 
cheques on their own bankers. 

A member of the Stock Exchange, at Newcastle, was 
called, and said he had had transactions with the defend- 
ant, and that in the course of executing orders for him he 
received and acted on instructions from Burness, but he 
doubted whether he ever concluded transactions without 
seeing the defendant. That he had, however, frequent 
communications with Burness on behalf of the defendant, 
and was in the habit of seeing Burness in the defendant&apos;s 
office, and had paid money to him for the defendant, but 
that he had never had transactions with Burness himself 
on his mm,account« (And this it will be observed was 
the eyid^nqe. of a witness residing at Newcastle, who had

Webb &apos;

The transactions continued till September, when there 
was a balance due to the plaintiffs; but, on their applying 
to the defendant, he disavowed the transactions, and de- 
clared his ignorance of them ; and he was now called, and 
gave evidence to the same effect, stating that Burness had 
tampered with his pass book and cash book, and that he 
had never, in fact, received the sums alluded to as credited 
to him in his pass book. He admitted, however, that he 
was aware of one of the telegrams, and that he made no 
communication to the plaintiffs about it. 

WiLLES, J. (to the jury). — Are you of opinion that the 
defendant did authorize Burness to enter into these trans- 
actions with the plaintiffs? if so, find for the plaintiffs; if 
not, for the defendant. 

If a man sanctions another in acting in his name, then he 
must bear the loss of the transactions entered into by the 
other, even although he derives no benefit from them. 

And if the defendant was aware that Burness was deal- 
ing with plaintiffs, either on his own account or defendant&apos;s, 
then the defendant is liable. 

It is admitted by the defendant that he knew of one of 
the telegrams. 

And cheques, drawn and remitted by the plaintiffs, are 
traced through his pass book to his bankers. 

When the defendant received the telegram he did 
nothing; at all events made no inquiries of the plaintiffs. 
Are you satisfied with defendant&apos;s explanations of these 
circumstances ; or are you satisfied that he was cognizant 
of these transactions ? If so, find for the plaintiffs (a).

There had been a former action for the same libel against 
one Yearsley, as the proprietor and publisher ; in which 
action the defence was that the paragraph complained of 
was supplied to the then defendant as a report, and the jury 
gave a verdict for the plaintiff, but only for 40^. damages.

For the plaintiff it was proved that the now defendant 
bad written the paragraph (as he said, at the request of 
the former defendant Yearsley), and that he had furnished 
a report of the application to the magistrate for the sum- 
mons on the charge of false pretences ; which report, upon 
the plaintiff&apos;s evidence, was not true. And the defendant

wanted some rape seed, upon which he was pointed out a 
sample of seed, and told it was English rape seed. And 
he bought by that sample. The seed was sent j?^ railway 
according to his directions, and (as suggested by the de- 
fendant) the wrong parcel of seed was received. 

The plaintiff re-sold the seed to various persons, and 
they sowed it, but it came up turnips. They complained, 
and claimed compensation, and he paid them certain sums 
to avoid litigation. 

The evidence on the part of the plaintiff was, that the 
two kinds of seed, rape and turnip, were so much alike 
that persons even in the business of seed sellers might 
easily be deceived ; and that even when the seed sprung 
up the resemblance to turnips was for some time very 
strong, for which reason it was that none of the sellers 
discovered the mistake until the seed had sprung up and 
the plant attained a certain height. 

The evidence for the plaintiff also went to show, that, 
although turnip seed was twice as valuable as rape seed 
in the market (that is, fetched a price twice the amount), 
a crop of turnips is not so valuable, for certain agricultural 
purposes, as a crop of rape. 

The plaintiff had paid to customers 63/. for compensa- 
tion. 

The case for the defence was, that rape could be dis- 
tinguished from turnip; and that when the plant sprung 
up the cultivation might have been altered so as to secure 
the advantage of rape; that therefore the defendants were 
not the cause of the injury j and that there was no legal 
damage. 

Kbatimo, J. (to the jury). — Was there a warranty of the 
seed as rape seed, or was it sold as rape seed ? 

2. Was there a breach of that warranty on the part of 
the defendants? Was rape seed sent and delivered at

3. Then, as to damages, if there was a breach of the

the sums paid by him to his customers were reasonably 
and prqperly paid, those sums are recoverable (a).

(a) See Carter v. Crick, 28 L. 
J. 238 ; Randal r. Roper, 27 ibid., 
Q. B. 211. 

The general principle is, that 
warranties only apply to latent de- 
fects or qualities. Hence, in Daw^ 
son V. CoUit, 20 L. J., C. P. 117, 
Maule, J., said that a seller can- 
not warrant a sack of beans to be 
a sack of peas, it being shown to 
and seen by the buyer. But this 
was a case in which the seeds were 
not distinguishable. The question, 
practically, was one of damage ; for 
• it was admitted that the plaintiff 
bad purchased rape seed, and 
though it was contended that on a 
sale by sample there can be no 
warranty (Sayerg v. The London 
and Birmingham Glass Company, 
27 L. J., Exch. 294), yet in trutb 
it was not a case of warranty, 
strictly so called, but of sale of 
one article and delivery of another. 
And therefore the real question 
was, whether the plaintiff, in re- 
selling the seed as rape, or the 
plaintiff&apos;s purchasers in buying and 



sowing it as such, and cultiyattng 
it as such after it bad sprung up, lo 
far contributed to the injury that it 
became not the legal and natural 
consequence of the defendant&apos;s 
oegkcC in deliTering turnip seed 
for rape seed; and therefore, in 
effect, the learned Judge so put it, 
that if the seed turned out to be 
turnip seed, the cause of action was 
made out. Being an action, bow- 
ever, for consequential damage, it 
was necessary, in order to recover 
such damage, to connect it with 
the defendant*8 act or default ; and 
this depended upon whether the 
plaintiff or his buyers could bave 
discovered the seed to be, what it 
was, turnip seed ; or remedied the 
mischief when discovered. If not, 
then the injury arose from their 
carelessness, and the only damage 
arising fVom the defendant&apos;s neglect 
would have been the delay, and 
the cost of carriage in returning it.

business, that undertakers should in each funeral charge 
the entire original cost of certain articles of funeral feature 
used (gloves, bands,&amp;c.), although they might be used at 
other funerals, 

Keating, J. — I will not exclude the evidence, but it is 
a principle of law that a custom must be reasonable (a), 
that is, that it must not be unreasonable. I shall put that 
to the jury. 

The evidence was accordingly given, and at the close of 
the case, 

Keating, J., told the jury that, in order to find for the 
plaintiff for the higher scale of charges, on the ground of 
the alleged custom or usage, they must be satisfied that it 
was such a custom as was reasonable, that is, such as was 
fair and proper, and such as reasonable, honest and right- 
minded men would adopt. If they thought it unrighteous, 
and so unreasonable, then they ought not to found a verdict 
upon it.

The plaintiff had lodged in a house of the defendant&apos;s, 
kept by a female housekeeper for him. Having resolved 
to give up letting lodgings and to eject the housekeeper, 
she resisted, and had recourse to the plaintiff, who sup- 
ported her in her resistance. Thereupon the defendant 
expelled her and the plaintiff, and proceeded to sell the 
furniture, which was removed by an auctioneer. Among 
the furniture thus removed were some articles belonging to 
the plaintiff, who claimed them, and having pointed them 
out, they were struck out of the catalogue; but in point of 
fact they had never been returned to the plaintiff, although 
he had repeatedly demanded them, and they remained at 
the auctioneer&apos;s. 

For the defence, it was not denied that the articles were 
the plaintiff&apos;s, but it was contended that there had been no 
conversion by the defendant 

It was replied, on the part of the plaintiff, that it was for 
the defendant to return the articles, having wrongfully re- 
moved them, and that the proper course for him to take 
after action brought was to have taken out a summons to 
stay proceedings upon delivery of the goods, with some 
trifling sum for damage. 

Kbatikg, J. (to the jury). — Did the defendant detain, or 
cause to be detained, the goods, so as to deprive the plain* 
tiff of them? IF he did not intend to do so, why did he not 
return them ? The proper cousre, even after aqtion, would 
have been to take out a summons to stay it upon delivery

The house being in Islington, the landlord living in

and had made various payments to the collector on ac- 
count. At Michaelmas she gave him notice to quit at 
Christmas, and a few days before Christmas gave up the 
key to a person who kept the plaintiff&apos;s empty houses, and 
a bill was put up in the house announcing it to let.

Martin, B. — ^There is nothing in that. There was no

Verdict for the plaintiff. 



(a) One of the jury ttroogly ex- 
pressed his surprise at the ruling, 
and declared it contrary to common 
understanding and daily usage; 
but the reason of the rule of law is 
clear. It is necessary, to make a 
notice good, that it should be given 
to some one whose duly it is to 
send it to the landlord ; and, more- 
over, he should be some one who 
has authority to reject or accept it ; 



otherwise the landlord might be 
concluded by a quarter&apos;s notice 
when half a year&apos;s notice was re- 
quired. It is otherwise where (as 
in a recent case in the Exchequer) 
the notice was given to a person, 
an attorney or house agent, who

On the 23rd February, 1856, the defendant made a ^^^BaSkJu* J*

7th March, he seized the stock assigned. 

On the 28th March, the bills not being due^ the defend- 
ant sold the stock thus seized, which realized more than 
the whole amount due^ and of which the surplus proceeds 
had been paid to the plaintiffs. 

On the 14th November, 1856, there was an adjudication 
of bankruptcy on the bankrupt&apos;s own petition. 

Martin, B. — There is no case. There is no relation 
back, where a trader has been made a bankrupt on his own 
petition (a), and the deed was not fraudulent or void. 

For the plaintiffs it was contended, that, the old debt 
not being due and payable (the bills being still running 
even at the time of the seizure), and the power of sale 
having been given and acted on as to the whole amount, 
the entire transaction was fraudulent and void as against 
creditors ; but 

Martin, B. — That is not so. There is nothing in the 
fact that the old debt was not actually payable, by reason 
of bills having been given which were not due. A man 
may lawfully get security for a debt, whether actually pay- 
able or not, and it is not any fraud upon other creditor8(&amp;), 
nor any act of bankruptcy, if it be partly also in considera- 
tion of a further advance (c).

party to be charged, even although there had been part 
performance or payment (no formal agreement had been 
signed by the defendant). 

The defendant was called and denied that he had re- 
ceived the agreement, and stated, that in his letter of No- 
vember 5th, he referred not to that, but to a verbal contract, 
on terms somewhat different, but substantially the same. 

Martin, B. — According to the defendant&apos;s own evi- 
dence it makes no difference, and the points raised do not 
arise. He says he never had the written agreement, and 
that his letters referred to a previous paro/ offer. That does 
not matter, if the letters contain (or refer to) the terms. 
Now the last of these letters was dated in December, 1857, 
and the bricks were to be delivered in and before the end 
of 1858, so it does not appear that the contract was not to 
be completed within a year, and the case is not within the 
4th section of the statute, and is taken out of the 17th 
section by the part payment and acceptance. The bricks 
objected to were taken back and replaced, and the whole

The plaintiff was a livery-stable keeper in London ; the

borsesy the defendant sent to the plain tifF for his account, i860, 
which was delivered to the amount of 1202. 

In December, 1857, the defendant, then, as it appeared, 
personally unknown to the plaintiff, called at the plaintiff&apos;s 
place of business, and inquired after the horse, and shortly 
afterwards wrote to the plaintiff, thus — 

&apos;&apos; I called for the purpose of arranging my account, 
but your conduct determined me to take quite a different 
course ; and I now inform you that I have purchased the 
horse which my son&apos;s servant delivered to your charge, 
and I am prepared to pay for his keep on your delivering 
him up. If not, I shall commence an action against you (a). 
I have no objection to your keeping the horse at a price I 
may approve ; but I will not be answerable for the keep of 
the horse after this notice.&apos;&apos; No answer was sent. 

No tender of the money due, nor any application for 
the horse, appeared to have been made. Nor, on the other 
hand, had there been any tender of the horse, nor any 
application for the amount due in respect of its keep. 

In March, 1858, the plaintiff sent in his entire account 
as against the son (which had then swelled to 164/.), and 
he accompanied it by a letter to the effect that he would 
give up the horse on payment of the son&apos;s account; that 
is, on payment of the whole amount due from the son. 
And on the 27th March the defendant wrote to the plain- 
tiff that he declined paying it, and also declined to pay for 
the keep of the horse beyond the date of his notice (in 
December, 1857), adding that he was still ready to pay 
the keep up to that time, and to receive the horse in order 
to dispose of it ; in which case he would render the plain- 
tiff an account of the proceeds and pay him any surplus.

Collier objected to that evidence.

Pleas: 1. Not guilty. 

2. That the plaintiff was the defendant&apos;s domestic ser- 
vanty and that on the day in question some person had 
feloniously stolen from the defendant some money out of a 
cash box in a closet, to which the plaintiff bad access. 
That just before the theft the defendant had left the cash 
box open in the closet ; that the plaintiff was the only per- 
son who was known to have afterwards entered it before 
the theft was discovered ; and that upon the discovery, the 
defendant, suspecting her of the theft, gave her into cus- 
tody,&amp;c. 

The plaintiff&apos;s evidence was, that she and her mistress, 
and other servants, were engaged on the morning in ques- 
tion in looking out linen,&amp;c., from the closet, and that she 
had occasion to re-enter it after her mistress left it. 

The defendant was called, and in the course of her evi- 
dence stated that she had locked the closet upon her 
leaving it, just before the plaintiff was supposed to have 
entered it; the object of which was to show that the 
plaintiff had no business to re-enter it ; she had never made 
this statement, however, before.

on the face of the alleged libel to show that it was in- 
tended to impute bribery to the plaintiff. 

HiLLy J. — The law is, that a publication without lawful 
excuse^ which tends to hold an individual up to hatred, 
ridicule or contempt, is a libel. Whether the publication 
held up the plaintiff to hatred, ridicule or contempt, is a 
question for the jury. Whether there is an excuse or not 
is, in the first instance, a question of law. There is, indeed, 
a rule which I may state to the jury, that it is allowable to 
discuss matters of public interest in the columns of the 
newspapers, but it must be done bond fide and without 
malice, or anything beyond what is necessary for public 
discussion. 

Temple having thereupon gone to the jury, calling no 
witnesses, 

• Hill, J. (to the jury). — ^The defendants have admitted 
that they were the persons that caused this publication to 
be inserted in the newspaper, and the question is whether 
it was or was not a libel ; and if you should find in your 
judgments that it was, then you will have to say what 
damages the plaintiff is entitled to. Any publication which 
. exposes an individual to hatred, contempt or ridicule, being 
published without lawful excuse, is a libel ; and I tell you 
as a matter of law, this committee of the Northern Reform 
Union, publishing a report which they had received from a 
sub-committee, did not constitute an excuse in law. It 
would be a lawful excuse to publish something on the 
character of another if a person was applied to by a 
master, and the person gave a bad character, without any 
actual malice. In the same manner, a person might pre- 
sent a memorial tb the Secretary of State on some matter 
of which he had cognizance ; although it might reflect on 
some individual, if without malice, it would be no libel. 
In like manner, a petition to Parliament might introduce 
similar matter, but which the law would call lawful and 



NORTHERN CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 



151 



justifiable. But the mere publishing in the columns of a 
newspaper something as to the character of another is a 
self-imposed duty, and does not constitute a lawful excuse 
in law within the meaning of the rule to which I have 
referred. There is, however, another rule, that it is law- 
ful to discuss in the columns of a public journal matters 
of public interest, provided it be done bond fide, with- 
out actual malice, or the unnecessary making of per- 
sonal imputations on any individual. The defendants 
had no right, however, when they professed to discuss 
in the columns of a newspaper, to make a personal im- 
putation on another individual. Therefore, adopting the 
rules of law I have stated to you, it will be for you only 
to say in this case whether this was or was not a libel re- 
flecting on the character of Mr. Wilson. It appears this 
all arose out of the last Berwick election, and according to 
the statement made by the defendants themselves in this 
publication they were a committee of the Northern Reform 
Union, and constituted themselves into a vigilance com- 
mittee in order to watch the proceedings, and this letter 
was in the form of a report of the Reform Union ; and it 
certainly did in most unmeasured terms (though it might 
be quite honestly) charge the parties who were interested 
in carrying on that election with the most wholesale 
bribery; and then they summed up by saying, &quot; the first 
exposures of the Union having failed to produce any im- 
provement in the mode of conducting elections in Berwick, 
and the persons there who traffic in votes being utterly im- 
pervious to public opinion, we have, as above stated, sub- 
mitted the evidence to the best legal advice we could 
obtain, and in accordance with that advice have issued 
writs,*&apos; and then they mentioned the names of the parties, 
including the present plaintiff. They then state &apos;* that in 
a few days writs will be issued against another list of 
offenders.&quot; It will be for you to say, looking at this 
publication, if it did not in the plainest manner impute to

the parties who had been selected that they bad been 
guilty of corrupt practices at Berwick election. If you are 
satisfied such an imputation was made, you will have to 
consider whether it was not calculated to expose Mr. Wilson 
to hatred, contempt and ridicule. Then it was urged by 
the learned counsel for the defence that all this was done 
from the sense of duty ; and though, no doubt, as I have 
said, it was a self-imposed duty, the motives might be pure 
and sincere, and if so you ought not to visit the defendants 
with serious consequences. I suggest to you, however, 
that any self-constituted body, which sets itself up for the 
reform of the public, whether in religious, in commercial 
or in political points of view, must be extremely cautious 
in all their publications and writings concerning private 
individuals not to reflect on private character (a). A man 
stands at fearful odds when he has to contend with a 
public body. If they publish that which reflects on the 
private character of individuals, they should be very 
careful of the contents of what they put forth. The 
question for you is very simple. Did the publication 
or did it not constitute a libel within the meaning of 
the rule laid down ? If it did, then you will find a 
verdict for the plain tifl*, and say what damages he is 
entitled to. 

The jury then retired, and, after being absent some time, 
returned into Court, when the foredian said they returned 
a verdict for the plaintiff*, with the smallest amount that 
would carry costs.

started for the conveyance of passengers between New- 
castle and Tynemouth, was passing down the river to Tyne- 
mouth. This steamer had created some little annoyance 
to other boats on the river by going at a greater speed, 
and being therefore likely to get all the passengers. Oa 
the 26th of August she started from Newcastle about noon. 
Soon after she started^ the steam-tug William and Mary 
started also. The steam-tug was constantly running ahead 
of the passenger boat, and from the volumes of smoke which 
constantly issued from the former, and also from expres- 
sions used by its captain, it was evidently the desire of the 
steam-tug to keep ahead of the Louise Crawshay and annoy 
the passengers on board by smoke. When the Louise Craw-- 
shay left Hebburn Quay, where she had stopped to take up 
or deposit passengers, the steam-tug again begun to run a 
race with her. Soon a peculiar coloured smoke was ob- 
served to issue from the funnel of the steam tug, which 
immediately blew up, and the deceased was blown into 
the air. 

Now the question in the case is, who is responsible for 
the death of the deceased ? Was death merely the result 
of accident? Or was it the result of some culpable act, 
or omission of duty, on the part of one or both of the 
prisoners? The captain and engineman, the prisoners, 
were in charge of the vessel along with the deceased. 
It was afterwards discovered, on the steam-tug, that the 
lever of the safety-valve was so tied down by weights 
that it could not act as a safety-valve. There was, there- 
fore, considerably more pressure upon the boiler plates 
than they could bear. Now there was nothing to have 
prevented any of the three men on board the steam-tug 
removing the weights. But there was a Government valve, 
to which there was a lock, fitted by two keys. One of 
the keys was kept by a Government inspector; and the 
other ought to have been in possession of the captain. 
There is no proof that he had the key at the time of the

explosion; but it was afterwards found that the Govern- i860. 

ment valve was in such a state that it could not work. ^T&apos;&apos;^^ 
w- . - J Reoina 

If it had been working no mischief could have occurred. v. 

Now it is always assumed that the captain had control and Another. 
of the whole boat. Is he to be considered guilty of 
culpable neglect in not seeing that the Government valve 
was in order? Or^ in allowing the steam-tug to go at a 
greater speed than was necessary? Or, in allowing the 
other valve to be in a state in which it could not work ? 
With regard to the engineer^ his duty was to attend to the 
working of the engine. He was bound to see that too 
much steam was not generated ; whilst the deceased fire- 
man only acted under the control of his two superiors. 
Now the law of the case is^ that a mere omission of duty 
does not render a man liable to conviction for manslaughter, 
unless it amounts to a culpable neglect on his part, to 
which the death can be clearly traced (a). It remains 
for his Lordship to express his opinion whether^ from 
his opening statement, such culpable neglect can be 
proved ? 

HiLLy J. — What is the act, either of omission or com- 
mission, which you point out as possibly to be regarded as 
culpable? 

Price— The omission is, that the captain, who must 
have seen the safety-valve out of order, allowed it&quot; to be 
so, and did not put it in working order. 



(a) Vide Regina ▼. Hughes, 26 
L. J., M. C. 202, where a banks- 
man, whose duty it was to place a 
stage on the mouth of a shaft to 
receive a loaded truck, and who 
neglected to do so, whereby the 
track ran down and killed a work- 
man, was held guilty of man- 
slaughter, but that was after ver- 
dict, and the jury had found, on 



sufficient evidence, that the death 
arose from the culpable omission 
of the prisoner. And there, per 
Campbell, C. J., if the omission 
was not malicious and arose from 
negligence only, it is -a case of 
manslaughter. The death of the 
deceased was the direct consequence 
of the omission of the prisoner to 
perform the duty.

Hill, J. — At present the difficulty is to show that either 
of the prisoners were in a position to see that it was out 
of order. Moreover, there is nothing in your statement 
inconsistent with the assumption that deceased himself 
could see it to be out of order (a). 

Price. — The stoker was not where he ought to have 
been, down in the hold ; he was on deck. 

Hill, J.— You must make out a decided and culpable 
neglect of duty on the part of one or both of the prisoners. 
Now it is perfectly possible that the fireman might have 
put the valve in order without the intervention of either of 
the prisoners. If so, it is clear you could not make out a 
felony. I do not think it was a case which could result in 
conviction, and therefore I direct a verdict of 

Not guilty.

to six persons at the last Beverley election, to induce recei^;^\he&quot; 
them to vote for Mr. Ralph Walters, one of the candidates pardon of the

at that election. The information was filed under the the Great Seal

which provides, that no expenses at elections but those privilege of

The facts of the case were these: — At the last election for 
Beverley there were four candidates, Mr. Walters, Major 
Edwards, Mr. Walker and Mr. Glover. Mr. Walters and 
Major Edwards were returned, and on a petition Mr. 
Walters was unseated. The inquiry resulted in the elec- 
tion committee recommending to the House of Com- 
mons that the defendant and another person should be 
prosecuted. The charge against the defendant was, that 
he had offered money as bribes for their votes to six per- 
sons, as the friend of Mr. Walters. The defendant was an 
innkeeper in Beverley, and a person of considerable local 
influence, and had been in the corporation fur twenty years, 
and held strong political opinions. Mr. Boyes had a

&apos;^l^ Gable.&quot; The people entered in Toll Gable, and pro- 
V. ceeded into an inner room where Mr. Boyes was seated, 

and exchanged some words, intimating that they were 
voters. They were then motioned to proceed to the next 
room, and expressions were used which could be heard in 
that room. There was a man in the second room well 
supplied with sovereigns. Mr. Boyes mentioned a sum, 
and the voter received that sum from the man in the inner 
room. Having received the money in this way, the voters 
passed out into the other street in which the house stood, 
called &quot;Walker Gate.&quot; 

Formal proof having been given of the election and re- 
turn of Mr. Walters and Major Edwards at the election on 
the 29th April, 1859, and of the register of voters, 

John Best, a carter at Beverley, was called and proposed 
to be examined as having received a bribe in the manner 
indicated. 

Martin, B., addressing the witness said, — I feel bound 
to tell you, afler hearing the opening of the learned 
Solicitor-General, that by the law of England you are not 
bound to state anything in answer to questions which may 
criminate yourself. You may answer or not at your pleasure. 

He was then asked. Do you know Mr. Boyes ? — I decline 
answering that question. 

The SoUciior-General. — I will relieve this gentleman 
of any difficulty as to that, as I have her Majesty&apos;s pardon 
for any offence relating to the election which he may have 
committed. (The parchment document, with the Great 
Seal attached, was tendered in Court to the witness as his 
protection.) 

Martin, B. said, it was the first instance of the kind he 
had heard of. If an authority *were shown to him he 
would act upon it. 

The SoUcitar-Oeneral referred his Lordship to Regina

Shaftesbury (c) ; Taylor on Evidence (d) ; Fawcett v. 
Munro, not reported, tried at the Old 6ailey« 

Overend would ask his Lordship whether he would not 
now tell the witness that he had a pardon and was bound 
to answer. 

Martin, B., said he must see the cases and make up 
his mind. It was a strong thing to commit a man for not 
answering. There could, however, be no harm in telling 
the witness he had a pardon. — (Addressing the witness) — 
That paper is a pardon to you, so that you can never be 
prosecuted for this offence. Does that make any difference 
in your wish to answer or not ? 

Witness. — I don&apos;t wish to answer any questions. 

Overend submitted that the witness had not the privilege 
to refuse to answer. 

The authorities referred to were then sent for. 

After much discussion on the point, his Lordship got the 
case Reg, v. Reading (a), and said it was directly in point 
that the questions could not be asked, even if the witness 
bad his pardon, &apos;&apos;as it would be a calumny upon him, 
and his name would suflTer.&quot; Was the decision right? 
Then, was there corroboration of the witnesses&apos; testimony ? 

The Solicitor&apos; General said there was abundant corro- 
boration. Several distinct acts of bribeiy would be proved, 
and after the first they were not accomplices of Boyes. 

Martin, B. said, he was in great doubt about the matter, 
and went to consult with Mr. Baron Wilde. On his re- 
turn his Lordship said, he had consulted with Wilde, B., 
and the impression on his mind was that the witness was 
bound to answer.

I860. ^ 1858. No bill of sale under the Merchant Shipping Act 
(17&amp;18 Vict. c. 104, ss. 65, 57, amended by 18&amp;19 
Vict. c. 91, 8. II) was executed until 14th September, 
1858. 

Between the dates last mentioned, namely, 30th July 
and 14th September, 1858, the liability in question aros&gt;e, 
and was discharged by the plaintiff. 

On the 30th September defendant agreed, by letter of 
agreement, to take from plaintiff (Alfred) the sixteen sixty- 
fourths which he (plaintiff) had bought from Thomas 
Chapman, and the letter contained this clause: &apos;&apos;and I 
take all liabilities or profits on the said share from the 
time of your purchase from Mr. Thomas Chapman, for 
which you are liable as owner in any way, or entitled to, if 
any, profits or balance in your favour.&apos;* On the day on 
which this letter of agreement was signed, a formal bill of 
sale was entered into between plaintiff and defendant. 

In the progress of the cause it was objected by JBrett, 
for the defendant, that neither the agreement of the 4th 
June, 1858, nor that of the 30th September, 1858, could 
be leceived in evidence. He submitted that, upon the 
execution of the bill of sale of 14th September, 1858, the 
previous memorandum ceased to have any legal existence 
between the parties, or at all for the purpose of evidence. 
He contended that the memorandum of 4th June, 1858, 
could not be looked at. He submitted, in like manner, as 
to the memorandum of 30th September, 1858, that it was 
displaced for all purposes by the bill of sale subsequently 
executed on the same day. 

Mellish and Charles Russell for the plaintiff, on the 
contrary argued that the question of the admissibility of 
the memoranda of 4th June and 30th September, respec- 
tively, depended mainly upon the intention of the contract- 
ing parties ; and that, in the present instance, the stipula- 
tion in both memoranda as to the time from which the 
liability of the buyer was to run was a collateral point not

touched on, and which could not, under the Merchant Ship- 
ping Act| 1854, ss. 55, 57 (17&amp;18 Vict. c. 104, as amended 
by 18&amp;19 Vict. c. 91, s. 11) be included in the formal bill 
of sale. It was, therefore, clear that there could have 
been no intention to give up an important item in the 
terms of the original contracts of sale. 

Martin, B. — I think preliminary memoranda leading to 
a formal contract are not necessarily displaced, and do not 
necessarily cease to have effect or to be admissible in 
evidence upon the execution of the more formal contract. 
The parties could not have put this term of their agree- 
ment in the bills of sale, and it seems to me clear they in- 
tended that that term should still be in force even after the 
bill of sale. Tbere is nothing in the Merchant Shipping 
Act to make collateral agreements illegal. I shall admit 
these memoranda, and reserve the point for the defendant 
if be pleases to move to enter a nonsuit (a). 

Verdict for plaintiff for the amount claimed.

what was the meaning to be given

to the operation of 17&amp;18 Vict

on the 5th March, 1854, he was served with a summons 
under the statute 59 Geo. 3, c. 12, reciting that he had 
unlawfully obtruded himself into a plot of land,&amp;c. be- 
longing to the township of B., and that he had been served 
with notice and demand of possession, and citing him to 
appear before two justices on the 15th March. The sum- 
mons was left at his house with his servant, he not being 
at home. He appeared, and the justices issued their war- 
rant to the constables of the township to cause possession 
to be delivered. One of the defendants was the church- 
warden, who attended with the other defendant, a con- 
stable, to execute the warrant, which was the trespass 
complained of. The plaintiff was expelled, the railings of 
his inclosure pulled down, and his cart removed towards

alleged account between the plaintiffs and defendant, and 
not to any facts of which the acceptor G, might be sup- 
posed to be cognizant. 

The plaintiffs answered the interrogatories, denying the 
alleged arrangement between them and defendant, and 
asserting that the acceptor, through the defendant, had 
employed them to charter a ship ; that it was necessary to 
pay a sum of money by way of advance; that the bill was 
transmitted through the defendant for the purpose, and 
that the plaintiffs only agreed to, and did, advance the 
money for the purpose, on the faith of defendant&apos;s indorse- 
ment. On the 10th July the defendant applied at Cham- 
bers before Channell, B., to postpone the trial, on the 
ground of the absence of the acceptor G., who was sworn 
to be a material and necessary witness, and to be in Scot- 
land (a), and could not attend the trial. It was not shown, 
however, that any endeavours had been made in the inter&apos; 
val between the commencement of the action and the pre- 
sent time to obtain his evidence or to subpcena him, and 
the summons was discharged with costs. 

The defendant withdrew his second plea, and now, the 
cause being called on, on the first day of the Assizes in the 
Crown Court (the criminal business being finished),

Rejoinder: 1. (To the new assignment.) Not guilty. 

2. (^To the third replication.) Joining issue. 

3. (Also to the third replication.) Setting out the agree- 
ment of demise in writing, whereby it appeared that the 
house was a beerhouse, and it was agreed that the plaintiff 
should use it as such, and also use his best endeavours to 
promote the trade and custom thereof, and would not part 
with the possession or occupation of the premises, or assign 
over or part with this agreement to any person whomsoever. 
That either of the parties might leave on giving to the 
other one calendar month&apos;s notice in writing, which might 
expire on any of the usual quarter-days (on which the rent 
was made payable), and that upon the expiration of such 
notice so given or received, Evans agreed to deliver up pos- 
session of the premises to Whittingstali. It was further 
agreed that if Evans should refuse to sell beer upon the 
premises, or should shut up the house or discontinue to use 
the same as a public- house, or if breach or default should 
,be made in any of the stipulations on his part, then in any 
or either of such cases, or upon the expiration of any such 
notice as might be given or received as aforesaid, it should 
be lawful for Whittingstali immediately thereupon to enter 
into the house and take possession thereof, and expel 
Evans, his family,&amp;c., without being obliged to bring any 
action of ejectment,&amp;c.

tioned bad been given by W. to the plaintiff and had ex- 
pired; wherefore, and because plaintiff did not nor would 
after a reasonable time quit or yield up possession of the 
premises, but wholly refused so to do, and wrongfully with-

Surrejoinder, joining issue. 

M. Chambers and Kemp for the plaintiff. 

Hawkins^ Joyce and Finlason for the defendants. 

The agreement of the 20th August, 1859, was put in as 
part of the plaintiiTs case, and it was proved that the plain- 
tiff went ih on a viiluation of fixtures and furattu&apos;re at 80/« 

On the 24th November the defendant Whitttngstall gave 
the plaintiff notice in writing to leave at Christmas. 

The parties saw each other several times in the interval 
between the notice and its expiration about the substitution 
of another tenant. The defendant W. was willing and of 
course desirous to accept anyone he, the defendant, deemed 
eligible, and to allow the plaintiff to let such tenant in at a 
reasonable valuation, and two or three persons proposed, 
but one was not deemed eligible by the defendant, and the 
others could not agree with the plaintiff as to the valuation, 
the plaintiff demanding to be repaid the amount at which 
he had been valued in, the other parties desiring a new 
valuation of the furniture and fixtures. Afler the plaintiff 
had on this point disagreed with the last of the persons 
who had thus offered, the defendant W. wrote to him to 
the effect that, if he did not accept a tenant at a fair valu« 
ation, he should put him out according to the notice. 

In the course of this evidence, 

Coc&amp;BURN, C. J. (his attention not having been drawn 
to the surrejoinder), suggested that some of these cokiversa* 
tions looked like a waiver of notice. 

M. Chambers thereupon declared that he should rely 
upon them in that view ; but 

Hawhins pointed out that toaiver should have been 
specially pleaded, whereas the plaintiff had simply tahen 
issue on the notice, that is, had merely denied that the

notice bad been given, go that evidence of waiver would 
be inadmissible. 

CoCKBURN, C. J. — That is so, no doubt (a). 

M. Chambers tbereupon applied for leave to amend by 
surrejoining specially that the notice had been waived, as 
well as by denial of it; wbereupon 

Hawkins asked that in such case be might be allowed 
also to amend, by a rebutter that the waiver was con- 
ditional upon the plaintiff&apos;s accepting a new tenant on 
reasonable terms, and also by pleading another replication 
to the third plea, setting up a right of re-entry founded on 
a breach of one of the clauses in the agreement, viz., the 
one against assigning over or parting with the possession 
of the premises. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — Any amendment which may appear 
necessary to secure a trial of the real matter in controversy 
between the parties shall be allowed on either side, when 
we see what the matter in controversy really is. If the 
plaintiff had intended to rely on waiver he would have 
pleaded it (&amp;). 

The case then proceeded. 

On the 2nd January, 1860, the plaintiff left the house 
and took a new one, taking most of his furniture, and leav- 
ing a man behind to sell the beer remaining in stock. 

On the 4th January the defendant&apos;s attorney wrote to 
the plaintiff to the effect that he expected the plaintiff to 
give up possession on the 10th, as it was the intention of 
the defendant then to take possession, according to the 
agreement.

On the 10th January the plaintiff wrote to the defendant 
Whittingstally intimating that he should not give up pos* 
session. 

On the 11th January the co-defendant took out the re* 
tnaining furniture,&amp;c., some of which were taken away on 
the same evening by the plaintiff, and the rest were put 
under a shed for him and removed next day. The goods 
were sold by auction at a loss. It was suggested that they 
were removed carelessly and so damaged, but the evidence 
as to that was slight and contradicted. 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury).— The only question for 
you, if any (except as to damage), appears to be, whether 
the notice was waived. Beyond all doubt it was given. 
And the waiver was not originally suggested on the part 
of the plaintiff, who evidently had never intended to set it 
up, or he would have pleaded it, and it was suggested 
originally by me, at a time when I was not aware that the 
plaintiff had not pleaded it. Still there might be a waiver 
of a notice to quit, as there may be of a breach of cove- 
nant or any right of re-entry for non-repair or non-payment 
of rent. The plaintiff, by his own conduct, showed that 
be did not understand that it had been waived, for he went 
away and took another house. There might be a mutual 
understanding, for mutual convenience, without any inten- 
tion of waiver. And if there was no more than that, the 
notice remained in full force, and if it was not waived the 
defendants are entitled to your verdict. If it was waived, 
then the plaintiff will be entitled to your verdict, and the 
question will be one of damages, as to which the defend- 
ants would be responsible for the negligence, though not 
for the wilful misconduct, of the men employed to remove 
the goods, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover 
compensation for loss sustained through a forced sale.

another bill, dated 22nd February, 1860, drawn by Read 
upon and accepted by the defendant, for 60/., three months 
after date. 

Plea: that the defendant did not accept the bills or 
either of them. 

Pelersdorff, Serjt, and Woolktt, for the plaintiff. 

Hawkins and Butler Rigby for the defendant. 

The defendant was a widow lady of some means, living 
at Shepherd&apos;s Bush, and the drawer was her son by a 
former husband. &apos;For the plaintiff one Miller was called, 
who swore that he had the first bill from the son, the 
drawer, bearing his mother&apos;s acceptance; that he went 
over to Shepherd&apos;s Bush to inquire if it was all right, and 
satisfied himself, but did not see her; and that he then 
discounted the bill, for which the other bill was afterwards 
given in renewal. 

For the plaintiff there was also put in a letter purporting 
to be signed by the defendant, dated 26th April, 1860, 
addressed to the son (and i^tated to have been received by 
Waldron, the plaintiff&apos;s attorney, from the son), couched 
in these terras : — 

&quot; What is the meaning of inquiries being made so long 
after the date of the bill ? You have always promised me 
that I should never hear of these transactions ; yet I re- 
ceive lawyer&apos;s letters which terrify me. If I receive any 
more such I shall go away, and you shall not know where 
I am. I beg of you to see Mr. Waldron at once.&apos;*

given of it, part of the plaintiff&apos;s case, as an admission; 
and in support of the ordinary evidence of handwriting

otbdr letters signed by the defendant were put into the I860, 
witnenes&apos; hands for the purpose of comparison of hand- 
writings being called for by the plaintiff for that pur- 
pose (a). 

Petersdorff, Serjt, likewise proposed to put in the pro* 
ceediogs in a&apos;former action against the defendant on a bill 
drawn by Read, in which she had given a consent in 
writing (which was produced) for taking a judgment by 
default. , 

CocKBURNy C. J. — You have not stated how you pro- 
pose to fix the defendant, whether by showing that the 
acceptance was her actual handwriting, or that she held 
out her son as having authority to accept in her name. 
&apos;That &apos; might be materiali with a. view to the admissibility 
•of the* evidence. But. at present it should seem that in 
neither view is it admissible; for if your case is that the 
acceptance was her own writing, how does the fact that 
she admitted a former bill to have been so show that this 
was so? And if you put it thus: — that she authorized it, 
how does the fact that she admitted a former bill prove 
that she authorized the drawer to accept bills in hei* name, 
unless you show that the former bill was accepted, by his 
band? And even if you showed that, a single instance 
would be no evidence of a general authority (b). 

Read, the drawer, was not called. The defendant was&lt;!alled, and denied the acceptances and the authorship of 
of the letter. 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury).— If the letter is genuine, 

. the bills probably are so; if the letter is forged, theg are 

probably so. If it was forged, it was forged in all proba-

Hawkins and Biron for the plaintiff. 

Finlason for the defendant 

It appeared that the building was originally a barn, with 
earth floor, no ceiling and bare walls and roof, and that 
more than twenty years ago the defendant, then being 
tenant of a house to which it pertained, fitted up the 
barn as a chapel, with the consent of his landlord ; and 
on the understanding that the fittings should belong to 
the congregation, and which he deemed to be fixtures. 
In 1858 the plaintiff had bought the house and barn 
at an auction, with notice of all this, and with an express 
reservation of the ** fittings&quot; in the barn ; to prove which 
the particulars of sale were produced by the auctioneer, 




HOME CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 183 

bat the deed of conveyance was not produced. The 1860. 
plaintiff had given notice to the defendant to leave, and 
his tenancy had thus been duly ternainated, and he had 
given up possession. But finding that the plaintiff in- 
tended to remove and appropriate the fittings of the 
bam (which had ceased to be used as a chapel), the de- 
fendant got the key, entered and removed the fittings, 
without, as it appeared, doing any damage to the walls. 
The plaintiff had not complained of this until nearly a 
month aflerwards, when the defendant disputed his&apos;ciaim 
to 6/., the balance due for rent, when this action was 
brought and the claim for the trespass included in it. 

JFinlcuon, for the defendant, contended that there was 
evidence of a licence either in law or in fact. 

CocKBURiY, C. J. — There is only a plea of leave and 
licence, which means a licence in fact, and before the tres- 
pass. 

Finlason contended that the subsequent acquiescence 
might be evidence of a precedent licence. 

CocKBURN, C.J. — Hardly so here. 

Finlason submitted that there was a licence in law. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — It is not pleaded, and scarcely could 
be (a). 

Finlason then claimed the verdict on the plea of not 
possessed to the second count in trover, a distributive 
verdict on the same plea as to the count in trespass, so far 
as regarded all but the entry (&amp;).

Bawldns pointed out that the entry and removal of the 
fixtures was after tiie determination of the tenancy. 

CocKBURiY, C. J. — ^.Undoubtedly it appears that the

away after the tenancy had been determined, and the entry 
cannot be justified, and as to that the plaintiff must have a 
verdict, as we)l as on the count for use and occupation. 
It is hardly worth disputing about the verdict for the 
defendant, as he cannot have the costs of the cause or 
trial (a) ; and as to the plaintiff, he cannot have more than 
nominal damages, and I shall not certify for costs.

shall follow the finding on such 
issue, and be adjudged to the suc- 
cessful party, whatever may be the 
result of the other issues (Finlason&apos;s 
C L. P. Acts, p. 182); and on the 
general issue to several counts the 
defendant has costs on the counta 
as to which the plaintiff has failed 
{Cox v. Thomson, 2 C. J. 498), 
deducted from the general costs of 
the cause if they go to the plaintiff 
{Knight v. Brown, 9 Bing. 643), 
and so even as to the general issue 
to the same counts ( Prudhomme ▼.

where the general issue is found for 
the plaintiff, and a traverse going

Second count: that on the 25th May, 1854, an agree- 
ment in writing was made and entered into between the 
plaintiff and defendant, which was set out in hac verba, and 
appeared to have been entered into on the part of the de-

authorized in that behalf.&quot; It recited the original agree- 
ment of September 27, 1850, which contained a clause to 
the effect above stated as to repairs and improvements, 
with this addition : &apos;&apos;That at the end of the tenancy the 
said Turner should be entitled to be paid a valuation for 
the tenant&apos;s property in the farm and premises in accord- 
ance with the terms of the valuation he should be subject 
to on entry.&quot; And then it went on to state that the said 



186 CASES ON THE 

1860. recited agreement of September 27th, 1850, not having 
ZT*&apos;&apos;^*^&apos;^ been duly stamped, and Turner having expended a con- 
f&gt;&apos; siderable sum of money in repairs and other improvements, 

and having also received notice to quit on the 29th Sep- 
tember next (i.e. 1859), it had been deemed advisable to 
enter into this agreement in order legally to secure to 
Turner payment of such compensation and valuation as it 
was intended he should be entitled to. And then it was 
witnessed that, &apos;&apos; it was agreed that Shaw, acting as the 
agent of Hutchinson, did thereby agree with Turner that 
he was to allow to Turner a full and fair compensation for 
his repairs and improvements on the farm and premises 
during his said tenancy, and also the amount of the valua- 
tion of the tenant&apos;s property, in accordance with the terms 
of the valuation which Turner had paid on entering, the 
amount of such valuation to be settled by valuers to be 
chosen by each party respectively, and the amount to be 
paid to Turner before he was required to give up posses- 
sion,*&apos; 

Averment, that the facts recited in the agreement were 
true; that after the tenancy ceased the plaintiff chose one 
J., as valuer, to settle with a valuer for the defendant the

The plaintiff was called, and proved that he entered into 
the farm in September, 1850, on an agreement with Shaw 
on the part of the defendant, which was in writing, and to 
the effect stated in the second count, and which was pro- 
duced, and appeared not to have been stamped. He paid 
the amount of the valuation to the outgoing tenant in the 
usual way. He had done repairs to the farm buildings 
and made substantial improvements in the way of con- 
structing roads, erecting walls, roofing out-houses,&amp;c., 
consulting Shaw as to all of them. 

In December, 1858, he received notice to quit. 

He saw Shaw, who consented to enter into a second agree- 
ment embodying the first, and the agreement set forth in the 
second count was accordingly drawn up and signed by 
Shaw on the part of the defendant. 

It appeared that Shaw was a kind of farm bailiff, who 
allotted timber to the tenants for repairs, sold the produce 
of the farm and let tenants in, on the ordinary terms of 
tenancies from year to year, and also received the rents. 

The valuation had been made and drawn out, and was 
produced, not stamped ; it set forth the amount due to be 
205/., as stated in the first count. 

The defendant had not appointed any valuer, nor bad he 
been made aware of the agreement entered into by Shaw.

and if you believe Shaw had only authority to let in tenants

Parry, Serjt, and Barnard for the plaintiffs. 

Hawkins and Maud for the defendant. 

It was opened for the plaintiffs that one Williamson was 
the agent of the defendant, and had first delayed the un- 
loading and then had disappeared. 

The case for the plaintiffs being closed, 

Hawkins opened for the defendant, that he was not the 
owner of the stone, but the foreman or manager of one 
Weston, the owner of the quarry ; that Williamson had 
bought the stone and that the defendant as his agent had 
engaged the plaintiffs&apos; vessel to carry it. 

Th^ shipping note given by the defendant was as fol- 
lows : — 

&quot; Shipped on board the M ,31 blocks containing 88 

tons, for Mr. 6. Weston, of Dalston, London Hermitage 
Wharf, Wapping ; freight Ts. per ton. (Signed) J. Lano.&quot; 

A letter from Williamson to the defendant directing him 
to get freight at the lowest rate was put in evidence. 

The defendant stated that it was usual for the quarry- 
masters to give such notes on the shipment of stone, but 
that they had nothing to do with the stone after ship- 
ment 

Hawkins asked if there was any usage in the business 
as to the payment of freight in such cases. 

Parry, Serjt., objected that the evidence of usage was 
inadmissible to control the contract^ and that even if it

r^^&quot;&apos;&quot;^^ give it, being only a stone merchant, not acquainted with 
and Another the customs of shipping. 

* Lano. Blackburn, J. — There is no contract in writing (a), and 

the usage is not as between consignor and consignee, but 
as between shipper and shipowner. I think, therefore, 
that the evidence is admissible. 

The defendant then stated that he never paid freight in 
such cases in his life, nor had he ever known the other 
quarry-masters do so — that the consignee always paid it. 

Parry, Serjt. — That begs the question, whether the 
shipper is liable ; or the custom is bad, being a custom 
that shippers shall not pay their debts. Besides, a custom 
that the consignees pay does not show that the shippers 
are not liable to pay. 

Blackburn, J. (to the jury). — The question is, whether 
the defendant is liable. That depends upon whether the 
plaintiffs took the stone on board to be carried for the de- 
fendant or for Williamson. If for the defendant, then he 
is liable ; if for Williamson, the real consignee, then the 
defendant is not liable, and the plaintiffs* remedy is against 
Williamson. 

Prim&amp;facie the contract is with the owner of the goods, 
as in the ordinary case of goods delivered on behalf of a 
vendee to a carrier, at the vendee&apos;s risk. The custom here 
set up is in truth nothing more than this — that what is the 
general law prevails in the stone trade. But if the carrier 
made a bargain with any one else, as the party who 
bought the goods, clearly that bargain would bind. So 
here the question is, whether there was such a bargain 



(a) Where there is, as here, not 
a contract in writing, but a mere 
memorandum, part of a transaction, 
the question of liability is for the 
jury on all the circumstances, as in

consignee on receipt of the goods ;

between the plaintiflfs and the defendant, that is, an agree- 
ment with the defendant at the time of shipment, to carry 
the stone for Aim. There is no contract in writing, the 
written memorandum put in evidence is not clear as to the 
parties to the contract. It may be, either that the defend- 
ant made the contract for Williamson or made it for /i/&gt;ii- 
self at Williamson&apos;s request. The master of the ship 
has a lien for freight, but not for demurrage, so that as to 
the latter, he would be likely to enter into some express 
contract.

dated in March, were put in, and the plaintiff stated that 
in April he had seen the defendant, who asked him &apos;&apos;what 
he meant to do about these matters/&apos; and that he offered 
his acceptance, which the defendant received, not to dis* 
count but to return former bills. 

Hawkins then called for the bill, upon notice to pro- 
duce it. 

Parry, Serjt., offered to adduce evidence that the de- 
fendant had it not, and had passed it away almost im- 
mediately. 

Blackburn, J. — I doubt whether that will suffice to 
exclude secondary evidence of the bill ; however, it may 
excuse you from producing it. 

Parry f Serjt, called the defendant upon the voir dire{a\ 
and he stated that the plaintiff had given him a blank ac- 
ceptance; and that on the 2nd May he had got it discounted 
at his bankers, who had had it ever since. 

Hawkins cross-examined the witness on the voir dire, 
and elicited that all bills went to Masterman&apos;s in London, 
and came back from them. The notice to produce was on 
the 12th July (the trial being on the 18th), and that 
he had told his attorney he could not obtain the bill. 

Blackburn, J. — I doubt if there is sufficient to admit 
secondary evidence of the bill (A). 



(a) The question whether there 
is sufficient proof of possession on 
the opposite party is solely for the 
Judge; Hurnry v. MUcheU, 2 M.&amp;Rob. 366 ; S. P., Btn ie v. Wise- 
man, 24 L. J , Exch. 160. 

(6) When a document is in the 
hands of a person who holds it as 
•takeholder between the defendant 
and a third party, the notice to 
produce is not sufficient to let in 



secondary evidence ( Party v. May, 
1 M&amp;Rob. 279); for though it 
need not be shown that the docu- 
ment is in the actual possession of 
the party, it must be in the hands 
of some one toko if iMJund to give up 
posseuion to him ; Ibid, ; Roscoe on

Baidnry ▼. Rechity 1 Stark. 338. 
So notice to a defendant to produce 
m cheque drawn by him and paid 
by his banker is sufficient to entitle 
the plaintiff to give secondary evi- 
dence of its contents, although the 
cheque remains in the banker&apos;s 
hands ; Partridge ▼. Coates, R.&amp;M. 156. If the instrument was in 
the defendant&apos;s possession at the 
time of notice, it will suffice, but 
if he has assigned it away, as in 
the case of a lease, before notice, 
secondary evidence will be inad- 
missible ; Knight v. Martin, Gow, 
103. [In this case it did not ap- 
pear that the bill was indorsed, but 
probably it was in blank.] But 
notice to defendant&apos;s attorney to 
produce a document which he has 
once parted with, but which in the 
course of business he ought to have 
bad back, is sufficient; Taplin v.

&quot;possession or power&quot; appear to 
indicate the scope of the notice to

the clause supplements or aids the 
common law powers as to notice to

Q. B| cm tfa« grounds that the 
question asked of the jury was irre-

against the evidence; that the ques*- 
tion should have been asked whe- 
ther Border got possession of the 
horse intending nut to pay for it, 
but to steal it, or defraud the owner 
of it; and that, on the facts, the 
plaintiff had no title. The rule, 
however, was never argued, and it 
should seem for the reason above

REGINA V. BULL. 

xHE prisoner was indicted for the manslaughter of his 
mother. 

Barrow for the prosecution. 

Ballantine, Serjt., and Griffiths for the prisoner. 

The prisoner, a niedical man, lived with his mother, and 
she being ill, he got a drachm of prussic acid, which filled 
one-fourth of an ounce bottle. After she came in from a 
walk he gave her some of the prussic acid ; she went up 
stairs, and, while taking off her bonnet, died. The pri- 
soner said he had given her four drops, but it appeared 
that the bottle had lost much more. The cork, however, 
was broken, and the bottle was loose in his pocket. 

The medical men called for the prosecution gave very 
obscure and confused evidence as to the relative strengths 
of different preparations of prussic acid, as to the mode of 
measuring *Mrops,&apos;* as to the quantities contained in 
&apos;&apos; drops,&quot; and as to the quantity likely to kill. But it 
appeared that the cork being held partly in would very 
much affect the quantity of a drop, and that the atate of a

Reoina ^ 

«&apos;• CocKBURNy C. J. (to the jury). — The prisoner is indicted 

for manslaughter, on the ground of his having administered 
a deadly drug with culpable negligence. If a person takes 
upon himself to administer a dangerous medicine, it is his 
duty to administer it with proper care ; and if he does it 
with negligence he is guilty of manslaughter. 

But do the facts here show such culpable negligence on 
the part of the prisoner ? 

If, indeed, the prisoner had given the deceased all that 
was missed from the bottle, it would be so, for the quan- 
tity would have been so large that it must have been the 
grossest negligence. But the cork was found broken and 
half out of the bottle, so that it is impossible to say how 
much of the poison might not have escaped ; or again, the 
cork being half gone, the liquid might have dropped faster 
than the prisoner supposed, and, if so, it would not be 
such culpable negligence as would make him criminally 
responsible. If you think there was not such negligence, 
acquit the prisoner. 

Verdict, not guilty.

flicted on him by the prisoner. He returned to Bchool^ I860. 
however, after the hoiidaySy and again at Easter on the 
16th April. 

On the 18th April the prisoner wrote to the father, 
stating that the boy was obstinate^ and that, were he his 
own child, he should, after warning him (as he had done), 
subdue his obstinacy by chastising him severely ; that, if 
necessary, he should do it again and again, and &apos;&apos;continue 
it at intervals, even if he held out for hours.&quot; The letter 
concluded thus : — &apos;* I cannot be blind to the fact that at 
Christmas I ran a serious risk of having my character 
damaged for life, and I do not think it right to run that 
risk again, I therefore write this to know your wishes.*&apos; 

On the 20th April the father wrote in reply, &quot; I do not 
wish to interfere with your plan.&quot; 

There was no evidence that the boy had been guilty of 
any obstinacy after Easter, and the prisoner had, just be- 
fore Easter, reported favourably of him. 

On the night of the next day, Saturday the 21st April, 
the prisoner took the boy into a room down stairs, and 
beat him for about two hours, between ten and twelve, 
with a thick stick ; using also a skipping rope. 

About midnight the prisoner was heard dragging or 
pushing the boy up stairs to his bedroom, and there he 
beat him again, until about half-past twelve, when the 
beating and crying suddenly stopped. 

From the evidence of the servants (who were the prin- 
cipal witnesses as. to all this) it appeared that the prisoner 
and his wife were for some time going up and down stairs 
engaged in washing out the stains of blood down stairs 
and up stairs, but that some of these stains were discerned 
next morning. 

Early next morning (about seven) the prisoner said he 
had found the boy dead, and almost &apos;&apos; stiffening.&quot; lie 
then went for a surgeon, who saw only the face of the 
boy. 



204 CASES ON TH£ 

1860. A subsequent examination showed that the thighs and 

^^&quot;^ other parts of the body were covered with bruises, and the 
9, medical evidence was that there had been profuse bleeding 

and extravasation of blood caused by excessive and pro- 
tracted beating, and that the immediate cause of death was 
exhaustion arising therefrom. 

The medical witnesses also stated that, upon the cti- 
dence, coupled with the prisoner&apos;s statement, the boy, at 
seven o&apos;clock in the morning, must have been dead about 
six hours, so that their evidence went to show that he died 
about half-past twelve, when the beating was heard sud- 
denly to cease. 

The prisoner had not avowed the beating until its effects 
bad been discovered by the post mortem examination, and 
had sent the body home so closely wrapped up, that the 
bruises were not detected until the coverings were removed 
in consequence of rumours prevailing. There was no post 
mortem examination of the body prior to the inquest, at 
which the surgeon, who had seen only the boy&apos;s face, was 
examined, and the prisoner, who suggested that the boy 
had died of disease of the heart. The verdict of the coro- 
ner*s jury, therefore, did not inculpate him. 

[The father had since died, and the elder brother was 
prosecutor.] 

Parry, Serjt, put In, for the prosecution, a printed slip 
from a newspaper, containing a report of the inquest, pasted 
on paper, with corrections and alterations in the prisoner&apos;s 
hand, sent by him to the prosecutor on the 27th April, and 
which did not mention the beating. He examined the 
prosecutor as to a conversation with the prisoner on the 
24th April, at which the beating was not mentioned. 

Ballantine, Serjt., in cross-examining, asked as to a 
conversation with the prisoner after the newspaper report 
bad appeared, in which the prisoner desired to take the 
prosecutor to one Clark, who was on the jury, to hear his 




HOME CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 206 

account of an explanation which it was suggested the pri- 1860. 
soner had given, but, 

Parry y Serjt, objected that Clark should be called; 
and, 

CocRBURN, C. J., was of that opinion. It is not part 
or the same conversation as that of which the prosecution 
gave evidence. 

Parrify Serjt., in re-examining the prosecutor, asked as 
to a letter which the prisoner had written to the father at 
Christmas, complaining of the complaints made as to his 
chastisement of the boy, and called for the letter of the 
father (to which that was an answer), notice to produce it 
having been given and p*roved. 

Ballantine, Serjt., did not produce it. 

Parry, Serjt., produced a copy in the father&apos;s hand- 
writing, but the prosecutor could not prove its correctness, 
and knew nothing of the original except from the father (a). 

Ballantine, Serjt., objected, and 

Parry, Serjt., did not press the evidence (b). 

The stick was produced in Court, and appeared at one 
end an inch thick ; at the other end it was edged with 
brass about the circumference of a sixpence, and there 
were holes in the shins of the deceased corresponding 
therewith, and which the medical witnesses thought must 
have been produced by poking therewith.

206 CASES ON THE 

1860. CocKBURN, C. J, (to the jury). — By the law of England, 

a parent or a schoolmaster (who for this purpose represents 
the parent and has the parental authority delegated to 
him), may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the 
child inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punish- 
ment, always, however, with this condition, that it is 
moderate and reasonable. If it be administered for the 
gratification of passion or of rage, or if it be immoderate 
and excessive in its nature or degree, or if it be protracted 
beyond the child&apos;s powers of endurance, or with an instru- 
ment unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce 
danger to life or limb ; in all such cases the punishment is 
excessive, the violence is unlawful, and if evil conse- 
quences to life or limb ensue, then the person inflicting 
it is answerable to the law, and if death ensues it will be 
manslaughter (a). The first question is, whether the death 
was caused by the beating inflicted? Secondly, was it 
excessive in degree? Now, there can be no doubt as to 
the first point, that the boy&apos;s death was occasioned by the 
beating received at the hands of the prisoner. 

Then as to the second point, whether the beating was 
excessive, the question can surely be only answered in one 
way ; for had the correction been moderate it is contrary to 
common experiepce that it should have resulted in death. 
One can scarce conceive of moderate chastisement resulting 
in death, except under circumstances of a very peculiar 
character, or in the case of a child with an unusual organi- 
zation. We have, however, here positive evidence as to 

had been guilty of any obstinacy at statements therein nnade were true, 

all, save the prisoner&apos;s own letter ; It is necessary to notice this, lest it 

which would not have been evidence should be supposed that excessive

prosecutor having only made a evidence of lawful cause or excuse, 

charge of mantlavghterf of course had been held merely manslaughter,

the nature, amount and degree of punishment inflicted. I860. 
It was inflicted with a thick stick ; it was continued down 
stairs for two hours and up stairs for half an hour longer, 
and according to the medical evidence until the boy 
actually died. That question, however, it is not material 
now to determine, viz., whether the boy did not actually 
die under the beating so protracted. For whether he did 
so die or not, if he died from the effects of the beating then 
or subsequently, and it was excessive, the prisoner is guilty 
of manslaughter (a). The evidence to my mind is all one 
way, that the boy died at the time, and under the prisoner&apos;s 
band, but that upon this charge does not matter. The 
stick with which the punishment was inflicted was not 
(though that, may be, is matter for you to determine) (b) 
an instrument fitted for the purpose of chastisement. And 
the beating was manifestly protracted far beyond the 
bounds of reason, moderation or humanity. If you think 
that it was so, and caused the death of the boy, find the 
prisoner guilty. 

It is true that the father authorized the chastisement, 
but he did not, and no law could, authorize an excessive 
chastisement. 

There can be no doubt that the prisoner thought the boy 
obstinate, but that did not excuse extreme severity and 
excessive punishment. 

The prisoner&apos;s motives, however, upon this charge matters 
not. If his excessive violence caused the death find him 
guilty.

which the plaintiffs were the purchasers of the piece of

the deed, together with all roads, ways,&amp;c., and all rights 
and privileges and appurtenances to the said pieces of 
land belonging or appertaining. And the plan in the 
margin described lot 30 as 11 a. Or. 5 p., being the parcel 
described in the particulars of sale as lot 30. 

The defendant had become the purchaser of other lots 
adjoining the plaintiffs. 

Lot 30 abutted on the alleged way or road, running 
between Mill End Town, Sbeerness, and Minster, and 
parallel with the Ordnance &apos;^ sea walL&quot; 

The defendant had dug open and placed bricks Qpon 
the said alleged roadway in front of that lot, so as to ob- 
struct the ax:ces3 therefrom to the roadway, except at a 
particular gateway, wbere the access was left open. The 
effect of this, if rightful, was, that the defendant would be 
precluded from building on this lot, as the houses would 
have no access to the roadway. 

The defendant had built houses upon his lots, with 
access to the roadway. . 

Bovill, for the plaintiff, called Clark the auctioneer, who

Ward. Cockburn, C. J. — That is so, no doubt (a). 

M. Chambers contended that it was only the plan upon 
the margin of the deed which was admissible ; but 

CocKBURN, C. J. — The plan exhibited to purchasers 
and referred to, with the particulars in the deed are ad- 
missible as the basis of the transaction, and as inter- 
preting the deed in which they were incorporated by 
reference. 

M. Chambers, — The plan is only referred to for the 
numbers marked upon it, in order to identify the different 
lots ; it has nothing to do with boundaries. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — That may or not be so as matter of 
construction ; but at present the only question is, whether 
the particulars and plans are admissible, and I think they 
are so. 

The particulars and plans were then put in ; and 

Bovill, having asked the auctioneer whether he stated 
that the plans truly represented the state of the property 
when sold, proceeded to ask as to the meaning of a double 
dotted line running parallel with the sea-wall, and which 
it was suggested represented a roadway. 

M. Chambers objected to such explanations or interpre- 
tations of the plans, which must speak for themselves. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — It must be shown either that this 
was brought to the knowledge of the defendant, or that 
every one would so understand*the plans. 

The witness stated that the defendant (an attorney re- 
sided at Sheerness, where the sale took place), had the 
plans, and that the dotted line represented a roadway; 

(a) Clave v. Harding, 27 L. J., Exch. 290, ace. 



HOME CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 



211 



that it was the ordinary mode of representing an occupa- 
tion roadway or right of way, and that every one used to 
plans would so understand it. 

Strong evidence was given of the use of the alleged 
roadway by the public for upwards of forty years. It led 
from Minster to Sheerness, and appeared to be the only 
road between those places, running all along parallel with 
the sea-wall, and between it and a large tract of marsh land 
intersected by watercourses. Part of the way opposite, a 
lot purchased by the defendant, and built upon, had been 
lighted and paved by the parish. For the defendant it 
was attempted to be shown that the user of the way was 
not of right, and that gates had been put up within twenty 
years, and once or twice locked ; but it appeared that they 
had been forced open when locked, and did not interrupt 
the right when not locked, but were usual in marshy land 
to keep the sheep from straying. 
At the close of the plaintifT^s case, 

M. Chambers submitted: — 1. That there was no e\\&apos;- 
A^nce of ownership \n the plaintiff, as the land adjoining 
or abutting on the hens in quo was described in the deed 
as in the occupation of one A., and there was no inference 
of ownership to the centre of the alleged way, as it was 
not a public highway, there being no evidence of dedica- 
tion to the public. 

2. That there was no right of access to the way except 
by the old gateway. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — Both points depend upon whether 
the way is a public way or a private way. If a public 
roadway, then there would be a right of access to it from 
any part of the plaintiff&apos;s land abutting upon it. As to 
the non^edication, it is not a question of modern dedica- 
tion, but of ancient user. There is evidence that there 
was an ancient highway. If so, then dedication is not 
the question ; and the evidence as to the putting up of 



1860. 



Bekridob

Ward. 



212 



CASES ON THE 



1860. 




the gates, so far from beiog against the right is evidence 
in its favour; for the gates were not allowed to be locked, 
and the right of way was exercised. To make these inter* 
ruptions of any avail, there must have been a submisBion 
to them. Where the right is based on recent dedication, 
the putting up of gates is strong evidence against the 
right, but it is otherwise when there is evidence of ancient 
user. 

JIf. Chambers went to the jury, and called evidence, 
which failed to disprove the user. 

He proved that by noeasurement the close, No. 30, if it 
included the hcus in quo, i. e., the part of the alleged way 
tn front of it, would contain, not 11 a. Or. 6 p., as described 
in the deed, but 1 1 a. 1 r. 40 p. (a). 

He did not, however, produce the deeds of the defendant ^ 
nor call him as a witness (&amp;). 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury). — Is the loctis in quo a 
highway, either by ancient user or by modern dedication ? 
If it be a highway up to the boundary of the plaintiff&apos;s 
land, then, as a matter of law, the plaintiff has a right of 
access to it from any part of his laud. If it was an ancient 
highway — that is, before the time of living memory — there 
need be no further inquiry. Aud if the public geaerally 
have used it beyond the time of living memory, then it is 
an ancient highway. And if it were once such a highway, 
nothing which the owners of the adjoining land may have 
done temporary to obstruct the rights of the public by 
gates,&amp;c. could divest it of that character. If the public 
used the way before the time of living memory, it matters 
not that it may have been a mere beaten track, and not a 
hard, made roadway. 

Then, as to dedication — supposing you think it was not 
an ancient public highway— did the owner of the land,

There was a covenant not to assign or otherwise part 
with the possession of the premises, and a condition of re- 
entry as breach. 

The lease was executed with a counterpart The lessees 
became embarrassed in 1869^ deposited the lease with one 
Bassett for a small advance. [It did not appear whether 
this was with such a written memorandum or agreement 
as would make an equitable mortgage.] 

On the 4th January, 1860, the lessees assigned all their 
estate, right and interest in the farm, and all stock,&amp;c., to 
the plaintiffs, in trust for creditors, and they entered into 
possession. 

They immediately saw one Allen, the landlord&apos;s agent, ■ 
and told him that the lessees would not carry on the farm; 
he offered to get a tenant who would pay them on a valua« 
tion, and they assented to that. 

A few days afterwards the agent introduced the defendant 
to them as a proposed tenant. The plaintiffs asked a pre- 
mium, but the agent said that, as the lease was forfeited, 
they could only be allowed to be paid a valuation. 

Nothing was said about the lease being given up to the 
defendant. 

On the 20th January the defendant wrote to the plaintiffs 
thus : — &quot; I am willing to take the farm, provided I am ac- 
cepted by your landlord on the covenants in the lease, by 
paying a valuation according to the lease, but no fur- 
ther &quot;(a). 

This appeared to have been assented to. In a day or 
two the stock,&amp;c., was sold by auction, and the defendant 
bought a great part of it and was let into possession. At 
the sale one of the plaintiffs promised the defendant &apos;&apos; to 
get the lease,&quot; but nothing was said about an assignment 
of it

the disallowance of the manure (a). 

Brawn made an attempt to prove his case by c;alling one 
of the plaintiffs to state a conversation which be had beard 
between the valuers in the presence of the defendant, but 
this failing to show a contract with the plaintiff to pay 
him, he put in the letter, upon which,

by the plaintiffs (as otherwise there would be a flaw upon 
the title of the defendant) ; and the disallowance of the 
manure, because the landlord&apos;s valuer deemed that the lease 
was forfeited, could not affect the question, whether that

nient way. .., i.-rvT,, ., - j, 

common with the plaintiff had a nght of way, and the 
question was, whether the gate had narrowed that right. 

In 1824, all the property including the soil of the lane 
belonged to Lord S., and he leased Putney Park to one L., 
with a right of way over and along the lane. 

In 1836, Lord S. and L. conveyed to the plaintiff Put- 
ney Park &quot; with all ways, rights,&amp;c. thereunto appertain- 
ing,&quot;&amp;c. 

In 1855, Lord S. conveyed to the defendant ^&apos; all that 
piece or parcel of land commonly called Putney Park Lane, 
situate,&amp;c., and all waste and other lands nigh or belong- 
ing thereto, and situate on the sides of the lane and hereto- 
fore taken to be part of it,&quot;&amp;c. 

There was in the centre of the lane a hard part with 
a grassy margin on each side, which enlarged a little at 
the bottom end where there had been a kind of sweep 
round into the road. The plaintiff had erected a lodge at 
the bottom of the lane with a line of palings on each side, 
coming at a right angle across the bottom of the lane, 
cutting off part of the grassy sweep and putting a gate in

the middle as wide as the hard or central part of the lane^ i860, 
to show that the soil in the part of the lane, alleged to 
have been encroached upon, had not passed to the de- 
fendant. 

There was evidence that L. had permission from Lord S. 
to enclose a piece of the lane so as to alter the sweep as 
above described ; that this was before the conveyance to 
the defendant, and that there had been no alteration of the 
sweep since then. The defendant&apos;s house was like the 
plaintiflf&apos;s up the lane. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — It seems to be a question of law, 
whether, if there is a private right of way over any land 
the owners of the land can define or confine it within rea- 
sonable limits. As at present advised, it appears to me 
that there is this distinction between a private and public 
right of way^ that the former is not necessarily, as the latter 
18, over every part of the land, access or along which there 
is the right of way. 

Hawkins then tendered evidence to show that the gate- 
way had so narrowed the way that the right could not be 
so conveniently exercised as before, and such evidence was 
received. 

The gate, however, appeared to be as wide as a turnpike 
gate, and the road was fifty feet wide. 

CocKBURN,C.J. (to the jury). — The question is, whether 
practically and substantially the right of way can be exer- 
cised as conveniently as before, or whether the defendant 
has really lost anything by the alteration made by the 
former owner and continued by the plaintiff? If you think 
that for all practical and useful purposes the way is the 
same as before, find for the plaintiff, if you think otherwise, 
find for the defendant.

by the officer. 

The money was paid, and not returned. 

The authority to distrain was put in, signed by Collins. 

The agreement declared upon was also put in, purport- 
ing to be between Collins and plaintiff, and signed by the 
defendant ** W. Smythe.&quot; 

The receipt for the money paid by the plainlifTwas put 
in, signed by defendant in the same way. This was in 
January, 1859. 

The notice to the bailiff to withdraw was likewise put in, 
signed by the defendant, thus : — ** W. Sm^the, solicitor for 
E. Collins.&quot; 

After the withdrawal, in June, 1860, the broker came in 
again, and continued in possession until the goods were 
sold. [The re-entry was within the six months; but the 
sale was after they expired.] 

Evidence was given of the defendant&apos;s evidence at the 
trial of the former action, to the effect that he was not the 
private attorney of Collins; that he had no actual autho- 
rity from her; and that he was acting only under the 
Court of Chancery as her attorney in the Chancery suit. 

But it did not appear that he had been examined as to 
any ratification; and it is to be observed that he was 
called for the plaintiff in the former action, and was ex- 
amined as an adverse witness, and not (of course) cross^

of 94/., the taxed costs thereon. 

Neither Collins nor the defendant was now called ; but 
it was taken as a fact that she had given him no actual 
authority. 

A written agreement by the plaintiff, that Collins should 
be &apos;&apos; considered as in possession for the space of six 
months/&apos; was put in. 

Hawkins contended that there was no cause of action 
on the^r^^ count in trespass; and 

CocKBURN, C. J., was of that opinion (a), the sale not 
having been till the six months had expired. 

Hawkins submitted that upon the other counts there 
was no case ; but, 

CocKBURN, C.J. — It must be assumed that the de- 
fendant stated the truth at the former trial, and that he 
had no authority (&amp;) from Collins; and that, upon the 
facts as he stated them, he had no authority to act for 
Collins (c). But he represented to the plaintiff that he 
had, and therefore is liable personally to him according to 
the doctrine laid down in Collen v. Wright (d). 

Hawkins offered to prove that the defendant acted under 
the authority of the Court of Chancery. 

CooRBURN, C. J. — It is the case of th^ plaintiff that he 
did so, and you can hardly prove it by parol, nor other- 
wise than by regular proof of the proceedings in Chancery.

inan falsely represents to another that he has the authority ^^^ 
of a third person to contract, he is personally liable him- 
self. Now here the defendant, in signing these docu- 
ments, represented that he was the general attorney of 
Mrs. CollinSi whereas it appeared that he was not ; and the 
plaintiflT, who would otherwise have had a remedy against 
her, was deprived of such redress, and failed in his action 
against her by reason of the absence of authority (a). 

The defendant is not liable as a trespasser, for the 
plaintiff took the premises from him (either as agent for 
Collins or not), and the rent was due ; and if the defendant 
was agent of Collins to distrain, his act has been ratified, 
for the plaintiff has never been troubled for the rent again, 
and doubtless was duly received. 

But on the count for false representation the defendant 
is liable on the ground I have stated.

warranty.

The particulars of demand (100/. having been paid) 
claimed as follows: — 

&apos;&apos;Two furnace doors, as per contract (10/. £ s. 

each) 20 

&quot; Royalty on 114 sq. feet grate-bar surface,

&quot; Attendance,&amp;c. 4 4 



&quot;£96 6&apos;= 



The prospectus of the plaintiff&apos;s patent was as fol- 
lows : — 

&quot; Prideaux&apos;s self-closinff furnace valve, and an apparatus 
which acts independently of any superintendence, and can- 
not get out of order.&quot; 

There were directions for applying and working the ap- 
paratus :— &quot; Provided the furnace and its doors be properly 
constructed, so as to prevent anything very defective in 
the draught of air.&quot; — &quot; If the application of the valve 
should not entirely remove all smoke, and its area is insuffi- 
cient for the process of cooling furnace, and therefore the 
quantity of coal supplied should be lessened by the furnace 
being cooled more frequently, or the area of the valve 
should be increased.&quot; 

The invoices of the plaintiff&apos;s invention had printed 
headings — &quot; Smoke-preventing Company;&quot; but the name 
or title of the invention (as already shown) did not include 
smoke-prevention. 

The defendants were paper-makers at Wandsworth. In 
1856, four furnace doors were put up at their factory. 
They then saw the plaintiff, who came down to Wands- 
worth, and advised them to abandon the old doors alto- 
gether, and said his new doors were perfect. The defend- 
ants ordered twelve, and in February he fixed them; they

between the bars, so that the smok^ should become subject v. 

to combustion and be thus consumed. In March 100/. 
was paid on account. 

In April the defendants were summoned and convicted 
under the Smoke Prevention Act (16&amp;17 Vict. c. 128) for 
unlawfully using a certain furnace not constructed so as 
to consume its own smoke. On the hearing both the de- 
fendants and the plaintiff were examined for the defence, 
and defendants gave evidence to show that the furnaces 
did^ or mighty consume their own smoke; but the plaintiff 
also stated that in his opinion the doors were too small, that 
he had made no alteration in the furnaces, and had only 
supplied the doors and fixed them to the then existing 
mouths of the furnaces. 

It appeared, however, that before the summons the de- 
fendants had complained that the apparatus would not 
work properly, and that the defect was in the motion of 
the bars, which was regulated by the action of quicksilver ; 
which, it was asserted, was a process too delicate of adjust- 
ment for common workmen. 

There was a great deal of evidence on both sides as to 
the cause of the defective action, it being admitted on 
both sides that the apparatus in point of fact had not 
worked so ^s to prevent smoke, and the contest being as 
to the catjse of the failure; the case for the defendants 
being that it was the defect of the patent, or the fault of 
the plaintiff in not fixing the doors properly; the case for 
the plaintiff being that it was from a want of proper ad- 
justment. 

CocKBURN, C.J. (to the jury), — The question comes to 
this, whether there was any express warranty that the ap- 
paratus would prevent smoke ? For, as to the doors, they 
could not be larger than the mouths of the furnaces^ which. 




228 CASES ON THE 

1860. were already built; and as to the alleged defect in ihe pro- 
cess, it was inherent in the nature of the apparatus which 
th^ defendants bouglit. If a man orders a patented article, 
which he knows, or might know of, it being matter of 
public knowledge (a), he must be taken to know what it 
is, and to judge for himself as to its value. In such 
case there is no implied warranty that it will answer any 
particular purpose or object. There may, however, be an 
express warranty ; and then, unless it answers the war- 
ranty, the plaintiff cannot recover the stipulated price. 
Then the question is whether there has been such a &apos;war- 
ranty. The term warranted need not be employed, there 
may be language equivalent to it, and implying, and con- 
veying to the mind of the purchaser, that the party sup- 
plying the apparatus undertakes that it shall answer the 
purpose. It is for you to say whether there has been here 
such an undertaking — that the apparatus will answer the 
purpose of making the furnace consume its smoke. It is 
for the defendants to make that out, he having purchased 
a patented article. If there was a mere representation, or 
expression of belief on the subject, then there was no 
warranty (&amp;). But was there any undertaking that the 
invention should answer the object ? The plaintiff denies 
it; aiHl it is for you to say whether, even if you believe the 
defendants, what they say amounts to it.

The agreement in writing was headed &apos;&apos; Between the 
Mess Committee of the regiment and R. Churchward, 
messman/&apos; and it was signed by the defendant. It con- 
tained the terms alleged, both in the declaration and the 
special plea. 

The circumstances of the dismissal as proved in evi-&gt;dence were these : — Afler the change of the committee 
there was a fracas between the plaintiff and another ser- 
vant whom he assaulted, and in consequence of the alter- 
cation he declared that he would have nothing more to do 
with the mess, and refused to send up dinner. Afler some 
minutes&apos; delay, the colonel of the regiment then came down 
and asked the plaintiff if he meant to send up dinner? 
to which the plaintiff replied that he would not, and used 
some language not respectful, upon which the colonel 
threatened to send for a file of soldiers and put him under 
arrest Thereupon the plaintiff served up dinner, which had 
been delayed nearly half an hour. 

The new mess committee held a meeting next day and 
dismissed the plaintiff. He tendered an apology, but they 
deemed it too late, and considered the offence too serious (a). 

CocKBURN, C. J., was of that opinion, and thought there 
was a just ground of dismissal. He considered, moreover, 
that it was very doubtful whether the action could be 
maintained. He asked the jury whether they considered 
there had been such misconduct as to justify dismissal ? 
They said that they did. Thereupon,

the same there, and caused unwholesome smells and

The plaintiff had purchased his house on conditions and 
particulars of sale^ mentioning &apos;^ that the adjoining land 
was fit for brick-making.*&apos; 

The defendant had bought the adjoining land of the 
same owner, and had commenced brick-making thereon, 
accumulating heaps of ashes for the purpose which be 
brought from other places, not working up only the brick- 
earth excavated on his own land. 




232 CASES ON THE 

1860. The plaintifTi and some members of his family gave evi- 

dence, &quot; that they were annoyed by the smell and smoke 
from the kilns, and in some slight degree from the heaps 
of ashes which contained some small admixture of decay* 
ing aninml or vegetable matter, but the former was the chief 
ground of complaint, and as to the latter, the defendant&apos;s 
evidence showed that the ashes were sifted in the usual 
way before being brought to his premises, and that any 
small admixture of the decaying matters alluded to was 
accidental and unavoidable. 

Moreover, the evidence for the defendant showed that 
he conducted the brick-making in all respects in the ordi- 
nary mode, and that the kilns and ash heaps were placed 
on the most convenient spots for the purpose, and as far 
as practicable from the plaintiff&apos;s house. 

And auctioneers and land agents,&amp;c. were called for the 
defendant, to prove that it was quite usual to sell land, 
even in and about the metropolis, with such announcement 
as above-mentioned, *^ land fit for brick-making,&quot; and 
that it greatly enhanced the value of the land. That it was 
customary to work up the brick earth on building land, for 
the purpose of brick-making, that this was usual in all 
large towns, apd that there was nothing noxious or offen- 
sive in the smells from the kilns, nor any thing which was 
ever considered a nuisance to neighbouring houses. 

For the defendant the case of Hole v. Barlow (a) was 
cited, and 

CocKBURN, C. J., in accordance therewith, directed a 
verdict for the defendant on the first count, and as to the 
second count, that being merely ancillary to the main 
ground of complaint, the plaintifi* could only have nominal 
damages, and he should not certify for costs.

After 72. I0«. had been incurred, the defendant gave no-

that he was not liable for more, or at least not for more

Blackburn, J. (to the jury). — The question for you is, 
whether the defendant was induced to sign the contract by 
the fraud of the plaintiff&apos;s agent ? Whether, in such a case, 
the plaintiff would be responsible for the fraud, is another 
question, one of law, it not being set up that the plaintiff 
knew or could know of it. There being the defendant&apos;s 
signature to the contract, the question is, did he know what 
he signed (a) ? 

The jury found that he did.

When the learned Judge -had addressed the grand jury

The high sheriff rose, and, addressing a number of ma-

The high sheriff still seemed determined to go on, when 
the learned Judge laid his hand on his shoulder, and said 
he could not permit him to speak, and he must request him 
to sit down. 

The high sheriff still persisted. 

Blackburn, J., threatened that if he did not desist he 
would fine him. 

Still the high sheriff would not sit down, and, 

Blackburn, J., said : — &quot;Mr. High Sheriff, I feel my- 
self called upon to fine you 500/.*&apos; — [His Lordship then 
directed Mr. Avory, the deputy clerk of assize, to record 
the fine, which was done.] 

The high sheriff still would not desist, and, 

Blackburn, J., then threatened to commit him for con- 
tempt of Court (a) if he did not sit down. 

The high sheriff then resumed his seat. 

Later in the day, the high sheriff came into Court and 
read a written apology, in which he expressed his sorrow 
for having committed any act which might bear the 
semblance of a contempt of the Court 

Blackburn, J., stated that he had no personal feeling, 
but must protect the dignity of the Court, and could not

On a subsequent day, the learned Judge, finding noise 
made by persons walking about in a covered place, be-

Court by a railing only, and otherwise open to it on the 
one side, and the street on the other, ordered that place to 
be cleared, which was accordingly done. 

The high sheriff was present, and did not either object 
to the order or assist in clearing the place and preserving 
the quiet of the Court (i). 

Towards the end of the assizes, the sheriff having lefl

** Gentlemen, — On Friday, the 3rd of August, Mr. Justice Black- 
burn, in my presence, but without addressing himself to me, ordered that 
part of the Court which is appropriated to the public to be cleared, at a 
time when perfect quietness prevailed among the public, who were there 
present according to custom. From that time the public have been 
barred out from the Court where Mr. Justice Blackburn presides, and 
the prisoners have been tried and causes heard without the possibility of 
the law being fulfilled, which requires that &apos; so many as will or can &apos; shall 
* come to .near as to hear.&apos; As your sheriflT, and feeling thit the gtrtieral 
dissatisfaction is well-grounded, it is my duty to record my protest against 
this unlawful proceeding ; and I have given directions that the Court shall

CocKBURN, C. J., being informed hereof, innmediaiely 
directed that the sheriff should be ordered to attend the 
Judges, and in the meantime, it is believed, communicated 
with Lord Campbell, then Lord Chancellor, and lately 
Lord Chief Justice of the Queen&apos;s Bench. 

On the appointed day the high sheriff accordingly ap- 
peared before both Judges. 

CocKBDRN, C. J., demanded of him whether the placard 
which had been posted outside the walls of the Court had 
been placed there by his authority. 

The high sheriff answered that it had. 

CocKBURN, C. J., then inquired what explanation he had 
to give for such a proceeding ? 

The high sheriff then rose, and said he was glad to have 
that opportunity of offering an explanation of the course 
he had pursued in publishing the placard. That course he 
had not taken without deliberation, and he was bound, 
with the greatest respect and deference to their Lordships, 
to affirm that he believed he had discharged his duty to 
the county of Surrey as the high sheriff appointed by her 
Majesty. He complained that Mr. Justice Blackburn 
had ordered a part of the Court to be cleared of the 
audience, and that the officers had actually executed the 
command. This, he respectfully contended, was an illegal 
act, and had the effect of invalidating the verdicts which 
had been afterwards returned ; and, this being so, he con* 
fiidered it obligatory on him to do what he believed the 
duties of his office required at his hands, viz., to assert the 
illegality of the course pursued by the learned Judge, and 
to command his officers not again to obey such orders from 
the Court. The high sheriff then stated that he distinctly

238 CASES ON THE 

1860. disavowed, on his honour as an English gentleman, the 

^^^^^^&quot;^ least intention to offer any personal insult to the learned 

The Sheriff Judge. He could only say, in conclusion, that he desired 

to treat the Court with all respect and submission, and 

that the step he had taken was taken upon a sound 

conviction that in ordering an English Court of Justice to 

be cleared of the auditory the learned Judge had assumed 

an illegal authority, and one which he (the high sheriff) 

felt bound to disobey, as the chief officer of the county. 

Their Lordships having consulted, 

CocKBURN, C. J., then addressed the high sheriff as 
follows: — Mr. High Sheriff, the Court has heard with 
anxiety and sorrow the statement which you have ad- 
dressed to them, amounting, as it does, to an entire justifi- 
cation of what we, as her Majesty&apos;s Judges of Assize, 
fitting as the representatives of the sovereign, feel to be a 
most improper, unlawful, and unseemly contempt of our 
office, and of the administration of justice. Mr. High 
Sheriff, you have most unquestionably mistaken both the 
law and the facts. You have mistaken the law, for the 
power and authority of her Majesty&apos;s Judges, acting in 
pursuance of her Majesty&apos;s commission, are perfectly well 
defined and established, and the course taken by my 
learned Brother was one which be had the most undoubted 
right to adopt. It is at once conceded that English Courts 
of Justice are open to the public in the fullest sense, and I 
trust they ever will remain so ; but it was going far beyond 
either law or necessity to avow, as you Mr. High Sheriff 
have done, that there is no power reposed in the presiding 
Judge to order such modifications of the arrangements of 
the Court as are indispensable to that which it is the office 
of a Judge to carry out : viz., the efficient administration 
of justice. You are equally mistaken, Mr. High Sheriff, as 
to the facts. The truth is, that no part of what is properly 
to be called the Court was ordered to be cleared. The 
fact is that my learned Brother ordered the lower part of 



HOME CIRCUIT, 23 VICT. 239 

the Court, open to the street, and not the other parts of I860. 



In re 



the Court, to be cleared, because the examination of wit- 
nesses in criminal cases, when prisoners were standing on The Sheriff 
their trial, was inaudible to the Court and jury, and there 
was surely a transparent necessity for the order which my 
learned Brother conveyed to the officers of the high sheriff. 
But, even were it otherwise, it is undoubtedly in the power 
of the Judge, in his discretion, to order the Court or any 
part of it to be cleared if due quiet is not preserved. It 
was your duty, Mr. High Sheriff, to take all necessary 
means to preserve such quiet, and to set the example of 
obeying an order which the Judge might give for that 
object. You, Mr. High Sheriff, had not made the least 
complaint or remonstrance before you left the assize town, 
and yet thought fit to issue this placard and have it posted 
on the walls of the Court while the Judge was still sitting, 
openly inviting your officers to disobey any future orders 
of the same kind which he might give. You have stated, 
and of that the Court is perfectly assured, that you, as 
an honourable English gentlemai), neither have intended, 
nor are capable of offering, any personal indignity to her 
Majesty&apos;s Judges; but the course which you have pur- 
sued is clearly a contumacious contempt of the Court, and 
a roost serious reflection upon the authority of the Judges&apos; 
commission, which emanated from the Crown, and de- 
mands, especially from the high sheriff, as one of her Ma- 
jesty&apos;s most important officers of justice, obedience and 
respect. I consider it my duty, Mr. High Sheriff, to fine 
you 500/.

their presence, he is but a minis- 
terial officer, whereas they are not 
only the highest judicial authorities 
known to the common law in the 
counties in which they sit, but they, 
by virtue of their commission, re- 
present the Crown, in its judicial 
character, in as high and plenary a 
sense as the Judges of the Superior 
Courts at Westminster. It so hap- 
pened that on this occasion both 
the Justices were Judges of the 
Court of Queen&apos;s Bench, who at 
common law had cognisance of all 
criminal cases, in any county 
(Reeves&apos;s Hist., Vol. II. p. 49). 
But this point, one purely antiqua- 
rian, would not differ the ease prac- 
tically, for the Justices itinerant 
have, by virtue of their commis- 
sions, all the authorities and powers 
of the Superior Courts {Ibid. p. 50). 
The sheriff is clearly the minister 
of those Courts, liable in contempt 
for not executing their sentences 
(R. V. Beardmore, 2 Burr. 292), 
bound to obey the writs issuing 
therefrom, and liable to attachment 
if he neglects to do so. So far, 
then, from having any peculiar 
privilege or power of resisting the 
orders of the Judges, the sheriff is 
of all men bound to enforce them. 
He is there for that purpose, and 
for no other. He is the Queen&apos;s 
officer^ and they represent the 
Queen in her Courts of Justice, and 
be is bound to preserve quiet, and 
protect them from disturbance. In 
the learned arguments in the case 
already cited, Stockdale v. Han- 
iard, 9 A.&amp;£. 1, will be found all 
the cases as to the power, inherent 
in all Courts, of committing persons 
guilty of contempt, and in CarneU 
V. Ferrand, 6 B.&amp;C. 611, where 



it was held that a coroner could 
turn a person out of the room in 
which he was about to hold an in- 
quisition, although it was recog- 
nized that Courts of Justice are 
public, the discretionary power of 
excluding persons disturbing the 
proceedings seems equally recog- 
nized. The privilege of publication 
of proceedings in Courts of Justice 
rests on the same principle; yet 
Judges have always exercised a dis- 
cretionary power of restraining pub- 
lication until the completion of the 
proceedings, and have committed 
for contempt in disobeying their 
injunction. Therefore the discrc 
tionar}&apos; power to exclude persons is 
clear; and may be shown in another 
way. No one could doubt it as to 
one or two persons, or any numbor 
of persons, who fail to keep silence. 
And if it is impossible to detect the 
particular offenders, (as it is the 
sheriff*s duty to do), there must be 
the same power of excluding all 
who are in any particular part of 
the Court whence the disturbance 
emanates, and, in an extreme case, 
the power of clearing the Court 
altogether. The sheriff therefore 
had either been guilty in the first 
place of a neglect of duty in not 
keeping silence, if he could, or if 
he could not, then the clearance of 
the Court ordered was necessary. 
Inferior Courts can only commit 
for contempts in Court (see the 
cases upon that subject collected in 
Levi V. 3foy&lt;ifi, 1 L. M.&amp;P. 307). 
But it is otherwise of a Court of 
that high dignity which belongs to 
one of the Superior Courts, or to a 
Court of Assize, and especially in 
the case of one of tit own officert. 
Hud the sheriff in Court verbally 



HOME CIRCUIT, 23 VICT.

kdted hit men to set at nought the 
orders of the Judge, of course there 
would have been a clear contempt, 
even in the case of an Inferior 
Court; and the law was not less 
clear in the case of a Supreme 
Court, when placards, while it was 
still sitting, were posted on the 
walls of the Court itself, tending to 
the same result, viz., resistance and 
disturtuince. Probably a private 
person would be liable, for such an 
act, to be committed summarily 



while the Assizes continued, as 
undoubtedly he would be liable to 
indictment and to fine or imprison- 
ment for a misdemeanor. But the 
sheriff, as the officer of the Court, Was 
clearly liable to summary punish- 
ment, tmtn if a stranger would noi 
have been. And the sheriff&apos;s mis- 
take was in fancying that he had an 
immunity, or any inherent authority, 
whereas he was, on the contrary, as 
a ministerial officer of justice, under 
a peculiar duty and responsibility.

go to the jury. Even supposing that the fact of an exist-

ing tenancy up to the year 1841 had been proved as against 1860. 
Norris, the presumption was that, Berrington being in ^T&apos;*^&apos;^ 
possession, that tenancy bad ceased. Then, as against and Others 
Berrington, there was no evidence whatever. The only ^„k Norrib 
evidence in the case was the admission of Norris, which 3*^f/o&quot;o^ 
could not be used against him. Being in possession with- 
out any evidence of how be came into possession or that 
be had ever in any way acknowledged a tenancy, must be 
presumed to be owner in fee. 

Erlb, C. J. — I think the evidence is suflScient to justify 
me in leaving the case to the jury. The probability is, 
that the defendant Berrington was under-tenant to the de- 
fendant Norris. If that is not so there could be no diffi- 
culty in disproving it on the part of the defendants. But 
I will, if necessary, reserve the point. 

It then became necessary to prove a notice to quit; and 
for that purpose a notice served on both the defendants on 
the 5th of April was put in, to quit at Michaelmas. In 
order to render this a sufficient six months&apos; notice, evidence 
was tendered of the custom of the country to enter and 
quit at Old Michaelmas and not at New Michaelmas. 

Erlb, C. J. — That evidence is inadmissible. The 
custom of the country cannot be set up against the legal 
presumption that Michaelmas means any other day than 
the 29th of September. You must show by direct evidence 
that this was an Old Michaelmas tenancy.

by law the power to act on a well-grounded suspicion ; 

that a felony has been committed by giving the suspected 

party into custody. But the grounds must, if they be relied 

on as a defence to an action of this kind, be stated in the 

plea and proved as stated. Here the defendant has stated 

his grounds of suspicion in the plea as something different 

from that upon which he now seeks to rely on. I have no 

doubt that I am right in saying that he cannot be allowed 

to do this, especially as the circumstances must all have 

been prominently before the parties at the time the plea 

was pleaded.

and were not likely to agree, upon their verdict. Upon 
thisy all other business at the sessions being disposed of, 
the presiding magistrate, in the exercise of his discretion, 
discharged them; and the case having been removed by 
certiorari to the Central Criminal Court, the prisoner 
pleaded to a similar indictment the following plea : — 

&quot; The said William Davison,&amp;c.,&amp;c., saith, that our 
sovereign lady the Queen ought not further to prosecute 
the said indictment against the said William Davison, be- 
cause he sailh that heretofore at the adjourned General 
Quarter Sessions of the Peace holden at Westminster, in 
and for the county of Middlesex, before William Henry 
Bodkin, Esq., Joseph Payne, Esq., and others the justices 
of the peace, being then and there duly assembled to hold 
the adjourned Quarter Sessions of the Peace in and for 
the said county,&amp;c., a jury of twelve good and lawful 
men were then and there duly empannelled and sworn to 
try the issue above knit or joined between our sovereign 
lady the Queen and the said William Davison; and the 
jurors so sworn and empannelled were then and there duly 
charged with the said William Davison, who was then and 
there duly given in charge to the said jury so sworn and em- 
pannelled as last aforesaid ; and the said William Davison 
was then and there duly given in charge to the said jury, 
and the said clerk of the Crown did then and there pro- 
duce divers, to wit, four witnesses for and in behalf of our 
said lady the Queen, who were then and there duly sworn, 
and who then and there gave evidence to the said Court 
and to the said jury so sworn and empannelled and 
charged with the said William Davison touching the said 
supposed misdemeanors; and the said William Davison 
further says, that the said jurors so sworn and empannelled 
as last aforesaid were then and there, and after they were 
so charged with the said William Davison as last afore- 
said, discharged of him the said William Davison, not by 
reason of any fatality or misconduct or request of him the

said William Davison, or for or by reason of any fatality 
or evident necessity of them the said jurors so sworn and 
empannelled as aforesaid or of any of them, or for and by 
reason of any accident or physical or mental infirmity or 
illness of them the said jurors so sworn,&amp;c. or any of them, 
or of the said justices of the peace or either of them, or for 
or by reason of any other sufficient or legal cause whatever ; 
and notwithstanding that the said William Davison did then 
and there, by William Campbell Sleigh and John Best, of 
counsel for him the said William Davison, object to and 
urge before the said William Henry Bodkin, Esq., Joseph 
Payne, Esq., and others, being justices of the peace for 
the said county, that such discharge of the said jury was 
unnecessary and would be illegal, and notwithstanding the 
non-consent of the said William Davison in that behalf; 
and this the said William Davison is ready to verify. 
Wherefore,&amp;c.,&amp;c. 

Replication : And hereupon Henry Avory, clerk of the 
said Central Criminal Court, who prosecutes for our said 
lady the Queen in this behalf, says, that by reason of any- 
thing in the said plea of the said William Davison above 
pleaded in bar our said lady the Queen ought not to be 
precluded from prosecuting the said indictment against the 
said William Davison, because he says that the said jurors 
so empannelled, sworn and charged as aforesaid were 
sent to and remained in their jury room for a long space 
of time deliberating upon their verdict ; and the said jurors, 
after the lapse of the said long space of time, came into 
Court and said they had not agreed upon their verdict, and 
that they were not likely to agree upon their said verdict; 
whereupon, all other business before the said justices 
having come to a conclusion, the said justices then ex- 
amined into the premises, and in the exercise of their dis- 
cretion, and in purauance of law, discharged the said 
jurors from giving a verdict. 



CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT. 263 



Demurrer. I860. 

Sleigh for the prisoner. — The replication is bad, and jT*^^^ 
the prigoner is entitled to his discharge. In Co. Lilt. 227 b, «• 

it is said, &quot; A jury sworn and charged in case of life or Davison. 
member cannot be discharged by the Court or any other, 
but they ought to give a verdict.&quot; And to the same effect 
is the passage in the 3rd Inst. 110,&apos;&apos; To speak it here once 
for all, if any person be indicted for treason, or of felony 
or larceny, and plead not guilty, and thereupon a jury is 
returned and sworn, their verdict must be heard, and 
they cannot be discharged.&quot; And the rule laid down in 
4 Black. Com. 360, is, that a jury cannot be discharged, 
except in case of necessity, until after verdict. The case of 
Conway and Lynch v. The Queen {a) is a direct authority 
in favour of the prisoner. In Newton s Case{b) it was no 
doubt held, that, whether or not the Judge was justified in 
discharging the jury, the discharge was not equivalent to 
an acquittal, and that the prisoner was properly detained 
in custody. There Erie, J., says, &quot; Taking the rule to be 
correctly laid down by Blackstone, the only question ap- 
pears to be, whut is meant by * necessity&apos; in the exception ? 
I think it means, not an absolute impossibility to avoid 
discharging the jury, but need in a high degree ;&quot; and 
Coleridge, J., says, *&apos; The true question, I think, in all 
such cases is, whether the whole circumstances of the case 
were such as to make the act of the Judge in discharging 
the jury a proper exercise of his judicial discretion.&quot; Now 
here the jury should not have been discharged except for 
reasons of fatality or of urgent and evident necessity, and 
it is contended that the facts establishing such necessity 
should in some way appear upon the record. 

The rule of law is clear that &quot; necessity&quot; must exist, and 
inasmuch as the replication sets forth no facts from which 
necessity can be inferred, the prisoner is entitled to judg- 
ment. — [Martin, B.— The Judge has a discretionary power,

his drscretion?] — He also cited Rex v. CobbeU{a); While- 
bread v. Fenwick (Jb) ; Rex v. Shields (c). 

F, £f. Lewis, for the Crown, was not heard. 

Pollock, C.3. — We are all of opinion that it is un- 
necessary to hear further argument. The question is, 
whether the plea is sufficient, and Mr. Sleigh chiefly relies 
on the case of Conway and Lynch v. The Queen. Now, 
though it has no doubt been laid down in the text books 
that a jury cannot be discharged except under certain cir- 
cumstances, it does not appear that prior to that case the 
improper discharge of a jury was ever made the subject of 
a plea. I may observe that in that case the Irish Court 
of Queen&apos;s Bench were not unanimous; and therefore, if 
the necessity arose, I should consider that we were quite 
at liberty to review it ; but it is observable that the case 
before them was one of felony, the present being one of 
misdemeanor only. But we are of opinion, generally, that 
where a Judge has exercised his discretion, that discretion 
is not to be made the subject of question. It cannot be 
ground for error, nor can it be traversed before a jury. 
It seems to me, therefore, that the plea the prisoner has 
placed upon the record is bad, and that he must yet answer 
the charge against him. 

Martih, B. — I think this case might, if necessary, be 
distinguished from Conway and Lynch v. The Queen, on 
the ground that that was a case of felony, and this one of 
misdemeanor. It is in the highest degree indispensable 
that Judges should be persons in whose discretion reliance 
may be placed, and I cannot by possibility see how such 
a plea as the present can be good. If the arguments on 
behalf of the prisoner be correct, and the circumstances on

which that discretion is grounded are to be stated in tlie I860, 
pleadings, the diflScult question arises, how is it to be &quot;JT^^^*^ 
tried ? Is it to be tried by a jury, or can it in any way be v. 

made the subject of appeal ? Both tribunals are equally Davison. 
incompetent to deal with such a matter. The fact is, a 
Judge is bound honestly to exercise his judicial discretion, 
and against that discretion nothing can be heard. 

Hill, J. — I am of the same opinion. I take the rule to 
be, that the presiding Judge at the trial is the sole arbitrator 
of all matters before him, and that his discretion is not in 
any way to be made the subject of review. I adopt the posi- 
tion laid down by Mr. Justice Crompton in his judgment in 
Conway and Lynch v: The Queen. He says, ** Two men — 
two Judges — might differ as to the occurrence of a necessity, 
and as to the course to be taken with a disagreeing jury 
in a particular case; but still it is the presiding Judge, 
and he alone, who is to decide (without the interference of 
a jury or any other authority) whether a case of necessity 
has arisen or not; this he does of course upon his judicial 
oath and his personal responsibility. So far, then, it is 
clear that the Judge has a discretion to exercise; where is 
the legal limit of his power to be fixed? The prisoner&apos;s 
counsel could not fix it; the Judges in KinlocKs Case and 
Sir M. Foster say it cannot be fixed. I need scarcely add 
that I cannot fix it.*&apos; I think this passage contains a 
correct exposition of the law, that it is applicable to the 
case before us, and that therefore the plea is bad. 

The prisoner was afterwards tried and acquitted.

year of her ^e. That her father died in or about the year 13C0. 
1850| leaving her mother and four children of him and her ^&quot;^^ 
«aid mother bim surviving, and that her mother died in the Elizabeth 
year 1851&gt;leavipg the &apos;said four children her surviving, and 
that her said father and mother lived and died members of 
the RoDoa^ Catholic Church, and brought up tlieir childreo 
in the same faitli. That, upon the death of deponent&apos;s 
mother, .the younger si.^ter, Elizabeth Daley, was in conse- 
quence of her illness taken into the inflrmary attached to 
the Marylebone Workhouse, and remained there about 
eighteen months, wlien she was discharged therefrom, and 
from that time deponent took charge of her said sister, and^ 
with the assistance of another sister and of friends, sup- 
ported her, and educated her in the faith of her father and 
mother, until about two years and a half ago, when, 
through temporary distress, deponent was compelled to 
place her said younger sister, Elizabeth Daley, then of the 
age of thirteen years, in St. Margaret&apos;s Workhouse, West- 
minster, and that she then stated to the officers of the said 
workhouse that it was only on account of temporary diffi- 
culties that she was compelled to place her in the said 
workhouse, and that she should shortly remove her there- 
from, to which DO objection was made. That her said 
sister was almost immediately thereafter removed into the 
workhouse of the parish of St. Marylebpne. That, about 
two months after so placing her said sister in St. Margaret&apos;s 
Workhou^ as aforesaid, deponent applied to the i^oard of 
Guardians of the St. Marylebone Workhouse for leave to 
remove her,, having in the meantime found a school where 
she would place her, and vi^here she would be properly 
maintained and educated in .her own religion, of all which 
deponent then informed the said parties. This application 
was refused, e;ikcept upon the terms of deponent&apos;s prqcuring 
the guarantee of some approved person that her said sister 
should not again become chargeable to the parish while 
she was under a certain age. That deponent was unable 



260 CASES AT THE 

1860. to procure any person to become so bound, until about a 
^^^p*^ year ago, when a person offered to take her said sister and 
Elizabeth apprentice her to her trade of laceraaker, which offer de- 
ponent then accepted, and immediately applied again to 
the said board of guardians for leave to remove her said 
sister. Deponent then found that her said sister had been 
removed by some person or persons, to her unknown, from 
the said workhouse, and had been placed by him or them 
at some school in the Marylebone Road. Deponent im- 
mediately, accompanied by the said (the person who 

was willing to apprentice her), applied at the said school 
for leave to remove her said sister for the purpose of ap- 
prenticeship as aforesaid, but the matron of the said school 
refused to allow deponent even to see her said sister, and 
refused to say when she would be discharged from the said 
school. That deponent went again to the said school about 
three months after the last-mentioned application, but 
found that her said sister had been removed from the 
said Marylebone Road, and that although she made many 
inquiries, and caused others to be made, she was wholly 
unable to discover to what place or by whom she had been 
so again removed. That about the commencement of this 
present month of October, having received information 
which induced deponent to believe that an institution called 
the &apos;^ Refuge for Houseless and Destitute Children, and 
Ragged and Industrial Schools,&quot; situate at 19, Broad 
Street, Bloomsbury, was connected with the said school in 
the Marylebone Road, she, on the 2nd inst., called at the 
said institution, when the matron informed deponent that 
a girl named Daley had been sent there from Tonbridge 
Wells, to be shortly shipped to Tasmania; that deponent 
then saw the said girl in the presence of the said matron, 
and found that the said girl was her said sister Elizabeth, 
and on deponent asking her why she was going abroad, 
she stated that she thought her family had given her up.

and that she might as well go as stay ; but now, that she I860, 
had seen deponent, she did not wish to go abroad. The ^^^^^^ 
same evening deponent saw her said sister again in the Elizabeth 
presence of the said matron and of a friend of deponent&apos;s, 
who also asked the said Elizabeth Daley why she was 
going away, and that she replied &apos;&apos; that she had been much 
persuaded by the matron at Tonbridge Wells, but that she 
had always said she would not go without seeing her 
sister/&apos; Deponent then asked her said sister whether she 
would wish to come with her, when she replied, &apos;^ I should 
only be too happy/* That her said sister then told deponent 
that, although a Catholic, she was compelled to attend the 
services of the Established Church. That, having reason 
to fear after the difficulty that deponent had had in finding 
her sister, and the obstacles that had been put in the way 
of her removing her from the said workhouse and from the 
said schools in the Marylebone Road, that her said sister 
might be again put out of the way and removed to Tas- 
mania, deponent then, under the advice of friends, in- 
structed her solicitors to take such measures as would 
enable her said sister to leave the said refuge if she thought 
fit. That deponent was in a position to support her said 
sister until she could obtain a situation for her, until which 
time she had the leave of her master for her said sister to 
reside with her at his house. That deponent verily be- 
lieved that her said sister was detained in the said refuge 
against her will, and that she made the application for a 
habeas on behalf of the said Elizabeth Daley. 

The affidavit of the solicitor stated, that on the Uth day 
of October instant, he was informed of the circumstances 
under which Elizabeth Daley was detained in the refuge, 
and was instructed to make application for her to be 
allowed to leave if she thought fit. That accordingly he, 
on the same day, called at the said refuge, and, upon ask- 
ing to see the matron thereof, be saw instead a person who

On the 2nd October there had been a summons to set 
aside judgment and execution. There was a contest of 
testimony on the affidavits, as to whether the writ was 
served on the day on which it issued, viz. the 3rd, or on 
the following day, the 4th. 

The learned Judge decided on the affidavits as to that 
question (&amp;), determined it in favour of the defendant, and 
set aside the judgment as irregular, the time for appear- 
ance, that is, eight days after the day he considered the 
day of service (i. e. the 4th) not having elapsed.

Afterwards, the matter having been again referred to the 
same Judge, on an application to the Court, it was now re- 
heard on another similar summons (a). 

It Was urged, on the part of the defendant, that the 
judgment was irregular, having been after appearance. 

It was contended on the part of the plaintiff that this 
did not matter, as there bad been no notice of the ap- 
pearance (6). 

The learned Judge having consulted Willbs, J., said he 
thought that notice of appearance was necessary in the 
case (c), but he confirmed his order setting aside the judg- 
ment an the facts, restraining an action which had been 
brought.

aside tlie order, the Court tbrew 
out that one or other of these 
courses might have been taken had 
it been suggested at Chambers ; but 
as there were additional affidavits, 
noi of new matter unknown at 
Chambersi the Court refused to en- 
tertain it, and referred it back to 
Chambers ; vide supra. See Mosley 
V. Biuke, 28 L. J., Exch. 36. 

(a) It is to be observed, that it is 
only by an isAie of fact that the 
matter of foct at to the regularity 
of the judgment could be deter- 
mined by a jory; for, if the judg- 
ment were ui atlde, it could not be 
tried in the action of trespass, for 
the judgment would no longer 
exist. Hence it is conceived that 
the issue of foct clause in the act of 
1852 is very important in cases of 
this kind, aflbrding the defendant a 
fkir means of trying the question, 
which if he decKnea dptng, the 
value of his affidavits may be 



doubted; or if the matter be trivial, 
there may be a more sunmiary de- 
termination, on an oral examina- 
tion of the parties. The trial of 
such a question on affidavit is, it 
should seem, very unaatisfactory. 

(^) The appearance book is in 
the same office as that kt which the 
judgment is signed, so that whether 
or not there is actual notice, there 
must needs be knowledge, or the 
means of present knowledge, of ap- 
pearance; and hence it is that, in 
order to sign judgment, an affidavit 
of non-appearance is required ; and 
even if appearance is nothing with- 
out actual notice of it, rule 161,

no^t deceased, and also by written authority from her yet if it ap-

Thfe affidavit of Charlotte Thornton (confirmed by R.) ^on^dFr&apos;^^ted&quot; 
stated, that she had resided with the mother and&apos; daughter her to be in 

1 II 111 custody of a 

as companion and housekeeper, that the mother had re- person, not a 
moved the child from the family of Mr. Routh, (who had chUd wilUot,

^ phcation to him 

1859, the mother&apos;s relatives alleged that she was insane, for direction, 
and desired to remove the child from her control and from the care 
place her herself under proper care. That in consequence 
of this the father was written to, who had for some years 
resided in Australia, and that in answer to this lettef the 
mother, in August, 1869, recdved from him a paper, which 
was set out in terms, and purported to appoint the de- 
ponent to be bis lawful agent, to act for him during his 
absence or until he should otherwise in writing direct, for 
the purposes stated &apos;&apos; that is to say, in case of the death 
or incapacity of my wife, I authorize and request the said 
Charlotte Thornton to take possession of, and retain until 
my arrival in England, or until otherwise directed by me, 
for my benefit and for the use and benefit of my daughter 
Emily now at school ; all goods,&amp;c. my wife may have, 
And also, if possible, to retain possession in my name of 
the cotta(;e (in which the mother lived), ahd to keep it as

further authorize and request the said C. T., in case of the 
death of my wifb, to take charge of and attend to the com-

EuiLT before I arrive in England, to write immediately to me for 

further instructions. And in case of my death I appoint 

my brother (of New South Wales) to be the guardian of 

my daughter.&quot; 

It appeared from the affidavit, however, that C. Thorn- 
ton wrote the mother&apos;s letters, she herself being paralysed, 
and it did not appear what were the representations or 
communications in consequence of which the above paper 
had been*sent. 

That afterwards the child went to a day school, sleeping 
at home, under the care of her mother and the deponent, 
until the death of the mother on the 19th November. That 
before her death, while sinking under paralysis, she made 
a declaration, attested by deponent and two other wit- 
nesses, to the effect that the above paper expressed her 
wishes ; that the mother&apos;s sister, Mrs. Routh, had removed 
the child, and that her husband, Mr. Routh, detained her 
and refused to deliver her up. 

Upon this affidavit, confirmed by one of the attorney, 
the writ had issued, dated December 5th, directed to Mr. 
Routh, commanding him to have before the Chief Justice 
or *&apos; such other Judge as may be at Chambers, immediately 
after the receipt of the writ, the body of Emily Suttor 
being detained under your custody as is said, together with 
the day and cause of her being taken and detained by 
whatever name she may be called therein, to undergo and 
remove all such matters and things as our Chief Justice or 
other Judge shall there and then consider of and concern- 
ing her in this behalf.&apos;* 

The return dated the 10th December was as follows : — 
** In obedience to this writ, hereunto annexed, to me di- 
rected I say, that the said Emily Suttor, upon the death of 
her mother and in the absence of her father beyond the 
seas, accompanied of her own free will her aunt, who is

and is not detained by her against her will (a), and I have 
now before one of the Judges of this Oourt at the Cham- 
bers,&amp;c. the body of the said Emily Suttor ready to abide 
the order of the Court.&quot; 

This return was supported by strong affidavits, setting 
forth that Charlotte Thornton was a mere nurse, and that 
the relatives of the child in England had never heard of 
the paper set forth in her affidavit until after the mother&apos;s 
death ; that the child under her care would not be in so- 
ciety suited to her sphere in life ; that the father, if he ever 
wrote the paper, must have written it under some misre- 
presentations of the nurse, who wrote the letters of the 
mother (she being paralysed as already mentioned); that 
be had been written to in order to ascertain his wishes ; 
that he could know nothing of {he nurse, who had been 
engaged in England in that capacity since the mother had 
left him in Australia; that the mother, before her death, 
bad fallen entirely under the influence of the nurse, but 
that some months previously she had expressed a wish 
that in case of her death the child should reside with her 
aunt ; that the relatives never heard of the declaration of 
her wishes sworn to by the nurse, and that it was believed 
when the father understood the matter he would not wish 
his daughter to be under the care of the nurse, and that 
the child was willing to remain with her aunt.

father from long knowledge had confided, and to whom he 
had intrusted the care of his child, whereas it appeared she 
was a mere nurse engaged to attend the paralysed mother 
during the last few years of her life. It appeared far more

It appeared upon the affidavits that the plaintiff was 
tenant from year to year to one Howell, from whom he 
had received notice to quit, expiring at Michaelmas; and 
that, on his refusal, an ejectment was commenced against 
him and his under-tenants, including the defendant, in the 
Superior Court, and which the plaintiff was defending as 
landlord. It also appeared that the plaintiff refused to 
quit, upon the ground that he was entitled to a long lease 
under an alleged agreement from Howell (which, however, 
Howell denied), and had filed a bill in Chancery against

No counsel for plaintiff. 

Murray cited Rankin v. Rankin (a), and argued that 
according to all the cases, when the tenant objects that his 
landlord&apos;s title has expired, title is in question. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — The defendant came in under the plain- 
tiff&apos;s, why does he not go out ? 

Murray. — He is not bound to give possession if his 
landlord&apos;s title has expired, if ejectment were brought in 
the Superior Court this would be a defence. 

WiGHTMAN, J., without deciding whether, under the cir- 
cumstances, title came in question, stated, that if there 
was any ground for saying that the plaintiff was entitled 
in equity to be considered as landlord, he might apply for 
an injunction to restrain the ejectment in the Superior 
Ck)urt; and adjourned the summons until such application 
should be made ; meanwhile staying all proceedings in the

Habeas corpus. 

A writ had issued pursuant to 66 Geo. 3, c. 100, 8. 2, 
on the last day of last term, and made returnable at cham- 
bers. It was directed to the reverend defendant, the su- 
perintendent of the Roman Catholic School where the child 
Mary Ann McDonnell was last seen, and Mary M&apos;Carthy, 
the schoolmistress; and commanded them to bring the 
body of the child Mary Ann McDonnell, who was between 
twelve and thirteen years of age, into Court. The affi- 
davit of the father, upon which the writ was granted, was 
as follows : — 

I, James M&apos;Donnell, for myself, say that on the 12th day of March, 
1846, 1 waa married according to the rites of the Romau Catholic Church, 
at St. Mary&apos;s Church, Horseferry Road, in the city of Westminster, to 
Bridget Cavanagh, who died on the 27th day of October, 1857, and there 
were issue of such marriage five children, four of whom are now living, 
the eldest of whom, named Mary Ann McDonnell, was bom on the 1st 
day of Febniary, 1847. I, James M*DonnelI, further say that my de- 
ceased wife Bridget was, up to the time of her death, nominally of the 
Roman Catholic religion, but seldom attended any place of worship, and 
that, until three years since, I waa of the same religion, but I am no 
longer a member of the Church of Rome ; that during the lifetime of my 
late wife Bridget, the said Mary Ann McDonnell waa, with the consent 
of my said wife, sent to a school in Horseferry Road attached to a Wes- 
leyan Chapel, and subsequently, in consequence of my changing my abode, 
she was, with the like eonaent, from July, 1855, to the beginning of 1858, 
sent to a school in Castle Lane, Westminster, attached to the Westminster 
Independent Chapel, Castle Lane aforesaid ; that shortly after the death 
of my said wife Bridget, my mother came to take charge of my house and 
children, and she, with my consent, sent the said Mary Ann McDonnell 
to a Roman Catholic School in Yqrk Street, Westminster, where she at-

tended up to the end of November, 1 858, but, in consequence of disap- 
proving the associates made by the said Mary Ann McDonnell at the last- 
mentioned school, I, at the latter end of January, 1 859, sent the same Mary 
Ann M&apos;Donnell again to the school in Castle Lane, attached to the said 
Westminster Independent Chapel. I, James M&apos;Donnell, further say that 
shortly after I removed the said Mary Ann M*Donnel1 from the school in 
York Street to the school in Castle Lane aforesaid, the Rev. Joseph Wil- 
liam Roberts, a Roman Catholic priest, and superintendent of the said 
school in York Street, called upon me on three different occasions, with the 
view of obtaining my consent to the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell continuing 
her attendance at the said York Street School, but which I declined to give. 
And we, the said James M&apos;Donnell and Ann M&apos;Donnell, for ourselves 
say, that We were married at St. Martin&apos;s Church, Strand, in the county of 
Middlesex, on the 25th day of October, 1858. We say that, on the 
morning of the 4th day of Aprfl, 1859, the said M. A. M*Donnell was 
sent to the said school in Castle Lane, attached to the Westminster Inde- 
pendent Chapel, but, on making inquiry, we found that she had not been 
there, but, on the contrary, had been to the said Roman Catholic School 
in York Street aforesaid. I, the said Ann M&apos;Donnell, for myself say 
that, on Toesday the 5th day of April, 1859, finding that the said Mary 
Ann M&apos;Donnell was again at the said Roman Catholic School, 1 went 
there and saw her, and the said Rev. Joseph William Roberts, and Mrs. 
M&apos;Carthy the schoolmistress, and demanded that the said Mary Ann 
M&apos;Donnell should be given into my charge, but the said Rev. Joseph 
William Roberta declined to give her to me, and desired me to leave the 
premises, but said he would deliver her to her father. And 1, the said 
James M&apos;Donnell, for myself say, that on the 5th day of April, being in- 
formed by my said wife of what had taken place, I went to the said school 
in York Street, but I could not find either the said Rev. Joseph William 
Roberta or the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell, although I searched the 
school and rooms adjoining thereto; and that on the following day, Wed- 
nesday, the 6th day of April, I went to the residence of the said Rev. 
Joseph William Roberts, for the purpose of demanding my said child, but 
he declined to see me, and on the following Friday, the 8th day of April, 
I saw the said Rev. Joseph William Roberts at 25, Palace Street, West- 
minster, adjoining the Roman Catholic Chapel there, when he informed 
me he knew nothing about my daughter, the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell, 
and if he did he would not tell me. I, James M&apos;Donnell, further say 
that, on the 28th day of April last I received the paper writing now pro- 
duced to me, marked &quot; A,&quot; which I believe to be in the handwriting of 
my daughter, the said Mary Auu M&apos;Donnell, but not her composition. 

The return was as follows : — 

William Walter Roberta, clerk, and Mary McCarthy, the 
persons to whom the annexed writ is directed (the said

the Court of our lady the Queen, before the Queen herself, 
that the said Mary Ann McDonnell, in the said writ men-

county of Middlesex, of which the said William Walter 
Roberts and Mary M*Carthy have the care and manage- 
ment, on the 5th day of April last, the said Mary Ann

manner, before she came to the said school, in the custody

the said Mary McDonnell remained in the said school after 
she had so come there as aforesaid, until about half-past 
twelve o&apos;clock on the said 5th day of April, having pre- 
viously refused to go home to the house of her father, James 
McDonnell, although advised and at liberty so to do. That 
the said Mary Ann McDonnell left the said school at about 
half-past twelve, or rather later, on the said 5th day of

that, up to the middle of March, 1859, she was a very good girl, and ap- 
peared anxious to please ber father and me, and any directions given to 
her by ber father or me were cheerfully obeyed by her ; but, about the

Walter Roberts, for I say that, on one occasion on my reqtteiting her to 
do some particular act, she declined, stating that I was not her motber* 
and had nothing to do with her, being the identical words which were ad- 
dressed to me by the said W. W. Roberts on a subsequent occasion. We, 
said Ann M&apos;Donnell and Emily Williams, say that, on Tuesday the 5th 
of April, between the hours of eleven and twelve o&apos;clock, we went to the 
Roman Catholic School in York Street, Westminster, and the deponent 
Ann M&apos;Donnell, in the presence of above-named Mary McCarthy and 
W, W. Robert?, requested said Mary Ann McDonnell to return to her 
home, but she declined to do so, and, on our taking hold of her for the 
purpose of making her come home, said W. W. Roberts interfered, and 
said, ** These are my premises ; I desire yon to leave them ; if not, I 
shall send for the police ; you shall not take her away, but I will give her 
up to her father, if he comes.&quot; And, addressing the deponent, Ann 
McDonnell, said, &quot; You are not her mother, and have nothing to do with 
her;&quot; and we verily believe that, had not the said W. W. Roberta inteiw 
fered, we should have taken the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell home to her 
father. I, said Ann M&apos;Donnell, say that I then \e(t the said premises 
and went for my husband, the said James M&apos;Donnell. I, said Emily 
Williams, say that 1 left said school with said Emily M&apos;Donnell, bat re* 
mained opposite to said school in the street, until said James M&apos;Don- 
nell came to me, when he went into the school with me, and searched 
the school and adjoining rooms, but could not find his daaghter, said 
Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell. And I say that said Mary Ann M&apos;DonDell 
must have been secreted somewhere in said premises, for I never left 
the spot immediately opposite the street door of the said school, and 
said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell never quitted the same from the time I left 
her in the school until her father&apos;s arrival, at about a quarter past one 
o&apos;clock. And I, said Emily Williams, further say, that in the course of 
my endeavours to persuade the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell to return 
home, I promised her that her father should not whip her again, when 
she replied that she did not care for his whippings ; he hod not hurt her. 
And I, said Emily Williams, for myself, say that I have resided in the 
same house with the said James M&apos;Donnell, and Ann his wife, and the 
said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell, for fourteen weeks and upwards, and during 
that time the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell was treated with the greatest 
kindness, and, excepting on the 4th of April, 1859, 1 never knew either 
her father, or his wife, the said Ann M Donnell, to beat, or in any manner 
ill-treat the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell, but, on the contrary, treated her 
with great kindness and affection. And I, said Ann M&apos;Donnell, for my- 
self, further say that, on the 7th of April, 1859, about eleven o&apos;clock in 
the forenoon, I saw said Mary M&apos;Carthy at the Roman Catholic School 
in York Street aforesaid, and begged her to tell me where said Mary Ann 
M&apos;Donnell was, but she said she could not say where she was, but she was 
not detained against her will. 

I, James M&apos;Ddnnell say, that I never beat the above-named Mary Ann 
M&apos;Donnell until the 4th day of April, 1859, when I beat her in eonse-

qutnoe of her having, againtC my express desire, gone to the Roman 
CatboitG Miool, in York Street, Westminster, although I had desired her 
to go to the aehool attached to the Westminster Independent Chapel, in 
Castle Lane, Westminster. On the said 4th day of April, I gave her five 
or six stripea with a piece of string which happened to be in the room at 
the time, and I savi that snch punishment was extremely mild, and not 
more than I should have inflicted in case of need upon her brother, a 
child between four and Ave years of age ; and although I punished the 
said Ifaiy Ann M&apos;Donnell for going to the said school in Yoi^ Street, 
as hereinbefore menf ioned, between the hours of one and two o&apos;clock in 
the afternoon of the said 4th day of April, and desired her not to go again, 
she was indneed to go, and did go the same afternoon, and did not return 
to her home until nine o&apos;clock in the evening. That up to about the 
middle of the month of March, 1859, there was no occasion for me to, 
nor did I, find fault with the conduct or behaviour of my daughter, the 
said Mary Ann McDonnell, she being a very good girl, and, until the 
last-mentioned time, was always ready and willing to do anything I re- 
quested her, and she always appeared, and I verily believe did entertain a 
strong fading of affection for me, as I did, and still do, for her; but, after 
the middle of the said month of March, I discovered a most marked al- 
teration in her conduct, but was uuable to discover the cause. That the 
above-named William Walter Roberts on three several occasions called 
upon me, and requested me to allow my daughter, the said Mary Ann 
M&apos;Donnell, to return to the said school in York Street, Westminster, 
aforesaid, the last of such occasions being on Wednesday, the 1 6th day of 
March, 1859, when, as on the previous occasions, I declined to allow her 
so to do. He told me that I was bringing her up in the wrong religion, 
and that I should be punished hereafter for it, and that if I allowed her 
to attend his school he would push her forward, and make a pupil teacher 
of her; and I say that my daughter, Mary Ann M*DonnelI, was aware 
of the vuits of the said William Walter Roberts, and of my refusal to 
allow her to attend the said school. That, on Monday, the 28th day of 
Marah, 1859, my daughter, the said Maty Ann M*Donnell, was sent, as 
she had been from the end d* the previous January, to the school at- 
tached to the Westminster Independent Chapel in Castle Lane aforesaid, 
but instead of going to the said school as directed by me, she, without my 
knowledge, and contrary to my desire, as expressed to the said William 
Walter Roberts, and of which desire she was aware, went to the Said Roman 
Catholic School in York Street aforesaid, and took with her her brother, 
between four and five years of age, and continued attending such school 
ftpm Monday, the 28th, up to the middle of the day of Thursday, the 
3 1 St day of the said month of March, when I first discovered that she was 
attending at the said Roman Catholic School. That on Tuesday, the 5th 
day of April, 1859, about eight o&apos;clock in the evening, my daughter not 
having returned home, and having heard, as stated in my former affidavit, 
that she was al the said Roman Catholic School in York Street aforesaid,

I went to the said school and saw Mrs. Bonner, who had the care of it| 
and informed her that my daughter Mary Ann had not been home, and T 
bad beard that she was with her, when she informed me that Mrs. McCarthy 
and the Rev. W. Roberts bad been talking about sending her to another 
school, and advised me to see the said Rev. William W. Roberts ; but although 
I endeavoured to obtain information from the said Rev. William W. Ro- 
berts, I was unable to do so, as appears by my said former affidavit The 
said Mrs. Bonner further informed me that she had given my daughter, 
the said Mary Ann McDonnell, some dinner, but she was not there then, 
and she did not know where she was, but I might make myself easy, as 
she knew she was all right. 

I most positively deny that, on my inquiring for my said daughter^ 
Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell, on the said 4th day of April, or at any other time, 
I threatened to kill or beat her, or bad, or have now, any intention of 
beating her. 

Badeley, for the defendants, submitted that that return 
was sufficient. 

Erlb, J., said the father had a right to the custody of 
his child, and suggested that the learned counsel should 
say where the child was. 

Cook Evans said he should be quite satisfied if that 
were done. 

Badeley said it was not in his power to say where the 
child was at that moment ; and he submitted, on the autho- 
rity of Reg. V. GreenhilUa), that, if the child were brought 
up, the Court would not order her to be given up to the 
father, but would consult the wishes of the child. 

Erlb, J. — Not in the case of a child of this age. The 
father would have a right to take iier by force. 

Cook Evans cited the case of Alicia Iiace{b), and he 
submitted that the father had the undoubted legal right to 
the custody of his child. 

Badeley said the child was afraid to go home, for fear 
her father should kill her; and stepmothers were pro- 
verbially severe. 

Erlb, J., said he could not enter into that or this return,

Cook Evans said he was taken by surprise, by the charge and Auoihcr. 

or cruelty made against the father, and he was instructed 

he could give a complete answer to that charge. The fact 

was that the father wanted the child to go to a Protestant 

school, and the child wanted to go to a Roman Catholic 

school. 

Badeley pressed the point as to cruelty {a). 

Erle, J., said he could not decide upon that without 
giving the father an opportunity of answering. 

Badeley said his clients would attend to any intimation 
given by the learned Judge. 

EfiLB, J., said he thought the better course would be that 
the parties should tell where the child was, and that then 
he should do nothing with respect to the return. 

Badeley said that in the course of to-morrow his clients 
would give notice to the attorney for the prosecution where 
the child was.

applied for a warrant to apprehend the defendant Roberts 
for a contempt of Court, on the ground that the return was 
bady and also false. 

Two affidavits had al&amp;o been filed, one by the Rev. Mr. 
Roberta, and the other by Mrs. McCarthy. The reverend 
defendant&apos;s was as follows : — 

1. I am the manager of the Roman Catholic School in York Street, 
WestmioAter. Mary McDonnell and her •istem and brother were regular 
attendants at the school previously to the month of November last. 

2. After the last Christmas holidays I believe the said Mary Ann 
McDonnell attended the school for about three weeks, but after that time 
she ceased to do so, and I applied to her father, James McDonnell, to 
send her back to the school. He objected to send her back on the ground 
that he did not like her companions, and that she was in the habit of 
playing with the other children of the school instead of returning home. 
Upon questioning him I found he could not specify any bad companions 
with whom she associated, and upon my undertaking to send the child 
home immediately after the school was over he promised to send her again 
to the school. 

3. Having always believed and having heard from himself that he was 
a Roman Catholic, I went to the said James M*DonneU a second time, 
about three months ago, to induce him to fulfil his promise of sending his 
child to the school. I was urgent with him on this point, because I be- 
lieved that he was acting against what he knew to be his duty, at the 
instance of his wife. On that occasion he did not promise to send the 
child, and I was subsequently confirmed in my impression as to the mo- 
tive of his omitting to send the child to school, by his wife calling on 
roe to request me to refrain from interfering between heraelf and her hus- 
band in the mi^tter of the child. On a subsequent occasion when I saw 
him in the presence of his wife, he denied that he had any intention of 
ceasing to be a Roman Catholic. 

4. On the 4th and 5th days of April last the said Mary Ann McDon- 
nell came to the said school in York Street of her own accord, and without 
being in any manner taken or sent there by me, or desired to go there ; 
nor did I know, before I went to the said school, on either of those days, 
that the said Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell would be there. On the 5th of 
April last 1 attended the said school in York Street, as&apos; usual, at about a 
quarter past eleven o&apos;clock in the forenoon. On my going there I found 
Mrs. McDonnell standing at the door. She said she had come to bring 
home Mary Ann M&apos;Donnell. 1 allowed ber to go into the school, and 
saw her go up to the said Mary Aon M&apos;Donnell and endeavour to take 
her away. She endeavoured for some minutes to persuade the child to 
go with her, and was proceeding to use force, while the said ohild was 
resisting and cryii^; violently. J told the said child to go hMne quietly

but she continued to resist. The contest between the stepmother and the 
child created a great disturbance in the school, and i told the former 
that, as she had no authority to take the child, she had better fetch the 
child&apos;s father to take her away. The said Mrs. M&apos;Donnell left the 
school at aboat half-past eleven o&apos;clock in the forenoon. I waited at the 
school till twelve o&apos;clock, when the school was over. The said Mary Ann 
McDonnell&apos;s father did not come while I was there, and I did not see 
him on that day. 

5. When I left the school, at about half-past twelve o&apos;clock, the said 
child was in the schoolroom, or in the passage leading thereto. I visited 
the school again in the afternoon, and found that the child had then left 
it, and bad taken refuge in the apartments of Mrs. Bonner. I also heard 
that the said child&apos;s father had been to the school. I went into Mrs. 
Bonner&apos;s apartments at about a quarter-past four to see the child, and 
found ber there with the said Mrs. Bonner. I understood she was in 
great dread of returning to her father. The said child was not detained 
Ibere by me or any other person^ nor was she under the digit test restraint, 
but might have gone home to her father&apos;s house had she wished it, and 
her father, bad he come for her, might have taken her away. When I 
left the said Mrs. Bonner&apos;s residence, the said Mary Ann M*DonneI! re- 
mained there, but she did not appear to, nor, as I am informed and be- 
lieve, was she uuder any bodily restraint, nor was any hindrance or 
impediment presented by me, nor as I verily believe by any other person, 
to prevent the said Mary Ann McDonnell from returning to her father&apos;s 
bouse, nor did I give her any direction nor use any persuasion to induce 
ber not to go home to ber father&apos;s house. Since 1 so left her at the said Mrs. 
Bonner&apos;s house she has not been in any manner restrained by me, or in 
my custody or possession or under my contra], nor in the custody or pos- 
session of any person employed by me or subject to my control. I did 
not at any time decline to see the said James M*Donnell, nor, to the best 
of my recollection and belief, did I ever say to him that I knew nothing 
of his child. 

Mrs. McCarthy&apos;s affidavit was as follows : — 

I am schoolmistress at the Roman Catholic School in York Street, 
Westminster. Mary M&apos;Donnell attended regularly the said school from 
February, 1858, to the end of November, 1858. Her two sisters and a 
little brother attended regularly from September, 1857. The said Mary 
McDonnell attended for three weeks in January, 1859. 

On the 4th of April, 1859, I saw the child Mary M&apos;Donnell loitering 
about the passage after school hours, and I asked her why she was not 
going home, as her father would be displeased. She said she was nol 
going at all. I asked her where she would go. She said she would go 
about the streets, or anywhere, rather than go home. 1 cautioned her, 
and begged her to go home, and she walked out to go home, as 1 thought. 

On the 5th of April a woman came to the door and asked to see Mary

M&apos;Donnell, and I brought the child out to her. The moment Mary sav 
her she ran away and hid herself. Shortly after, about eleven o&apos;clock, 
another woman, who I afterwards found was Mrs. M&apos;Donnell, came to 
the school, and those two women endeavoured, by force, to remove the 
child. The Rev. Mr. Roberts, who had entered the school at the same 
time with Mrs. M&apos;Donnell, stood by without interfering for some time, 
and I believe he then said something to the effect that he wished the 
child to go home quietly. I asked the women to let her stay till twelve 
o&apos;clock, and that then she would go home, but they reftised to allow her 
to stay till twelve. The whole class was in confusion, and all the chil- 
dren were crying and screaming. Then Mr. Roberts interposed, and said 
that as Mrs. M&apos;Donnell had no authority over the child, she should send 
the father, in order that he might take her. Mrs. M&apos;Donnell then left the 
school. In the dinner hour, I believe, her father came, but I was not at 
the school when he came. I saw Mary M&apos;Donnell the same day at half-past 
four in the passage leading to the school, and afterwards in the evening, 
taking tea with Mrs. Bonner, and since that time I have not seen her, nor 
has she since been, nor is she now, in any way in my custody or power. 

Badeley, for the defendants, argued that the return was 
sufficient, and that the affidavit sustained a case of cruelty 
against the father, upon which the Judge should hold his 
hand and not compel the child to return to him. In re 
Race, the Lord Chief Justice, in his considered judgment, 
said the Court would not order the child to be delivered to 
the parent if they could see it was desired for any improper 
purpose. 

Cook Evans argued that the return was insufficient, and 
moreover shown to be false upon the facts, and that the 
charge of cruelty was a mere after-thought, and could not 
be raised properly on this return. 

EiiLE, J., said he thought the return insufficient, but it 
was a matter of such importance that he preferred the 
whole matter being submitted to the consideration of the 
Court, and that the warrant should issue nominally, and 
not be executed until after Mr. Roberts had declined to 
give the necessary security for the defendant&apos;s appearance 
before the full Court (a). 



(a) This course was accordingly 
taken, and the whole matter argued 
in the ensuing term, when the re- 



turn was held bad, and the defend- 
ants declared in contempt.

The deceased kept the Great Northern Railway Inn, 
where the plaintiflTone night became a gaest. There was 
a printed notice in his bedroom in these terms : — 

^&apos;Several robberies having taken place during the nights 
in the principal hotels of London^ the proprietors request 
that all articles of value be left at the bar, otherwise they 
will not be held responsible for the loss of them.&quot; 

The plaintiflT denied that he had read this notice. 

He had with him a gold repeater^ some money, and 
other articles, and did not leave them at the bar, bat kept 
them in his bedroom. 

There was a night bolt to his door, and he did not use it ; 
but he locked his doon 

In the morning he found the articles missing, and they 
were not recovered, nor was it shown what had become of 
them, nor who had taken them. 

On the part of the defendants it was objected : — 1. That 
there was no evidence of negligence; that the deceased had 
done all in his power to prevent a loss, and was not liable 
absolutely as an insurer (a). 2. That the notice must be 
taken as incorporated with the contract, and relieved the 
deceased of all liability. 3. That the defendants, as eze- 
cutarSf were not liable, the action not being founded on 
contract, nor for a &quot; wrong&quot; committed by the testator (ft).

Plea : not guilty. 

Parry^ Serjt., and Hodgson^ for the plaintiff. 

Tindal Atkinson for the defendant 

The defendant kept a commercial inn in London, and 
the plaintiff had slept there and lost a watch which he had 
with him in his bedroom over night, and missed next 
morning. 

The chambermaid had been charged with stealing it, and 
had been taken before a magistrate, but, being released for 
want of evidence, she had absconded. 

The plaintiff was cross-examined as to his having shown 
his watch to the maid over night, as to his not locking his 
door on going to bed, and as to his leaving his roopi door 
open when he had occasion to get up and go down stairs 
about six o&apos;clock, just when the servants were rising. He 
said that he left it in the room on that occasion, and had 
not missed it on his return to the room, but on his rising 
about an hour afterwards. 

Tindal Atkinson proposed to call the defendant, to show 
that he had taken every possible care and precaution, and 
that the loss was through the plaintiff&apos;s own negligence. 

Parry^ Serjt., objected, but, 

Eble, C. J., after considering the case of Cashill v. 
IFrtyA^ (a), admitted the evidence. 
The defendant, being called, was asked as to a custom 



bow it is alleged (Ihld,)\ and 
though, to the extent to which it 
does arise, there is an implied pro- 
mise which might be stated, it need 
not be stated, and if stated, requires 
no proof beyond the fact or facta 
raising the duty in law ; vide C. L. P. 
Act, 1852, ss. 49, 50 (Finlason&apos;s

and therefore the form of action is 



immaterial ; vide same Act, s. 74 ; 
saro* work, p. 91. Here^ however, 
the declaration states a default^ 
though it stated a stealing. But 
notwithstanding that, the C. J., it

Parry^ Serjt, objected, as it was not to the plaintiff&apos;s 
knowledge; but, 

. Erlb, C. J.| said he did not see how he could exclude 
the evidence. 

It appeared that the custom was for the keys to be kept 
at the bar, and not delivered to any one but the guests or 
the chambermaid. 

The defendant being asked as to what had been said at 
the police-office, in the presence of the plaintiff, 

Parry^ Serjt., objected, that the depositions ought to 
have been produced ; but, 

Erle, C. J., admitted the evidence, observing that, for 
the present purpose, it did not come within the rule as to 
what was called &quot; pre-appointed evidence,&quot; as laid down 
by Mr. Best in his Treatise on Presumptive Eoidence, p. 
26 (a). 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury).— The case for the plaintiff is, 
that the watch was st&apos;)len from him while he was a guest 
in the defendant&apos;s inn. If so, according to the law of 
England, the defendant is hable, unless you are of opinion 
that the plaintiff&apos;s own negligence occasioned the loss. 
That would not be so if he &apos;&apos;did all that a reasonable man 
might be reasonably expected to do under the circum- 
stances&quot; {b). Therefore it is necessary to consider all the 
circumstances, as that it was a London inn, where bad cha- 
racters might be expected. If the plaintiff took less care

for a breach of duty, unless the 
negligence of the guest occasions

loss would not have happened if the

290 CASES AT TH£ MIDDLESEX 

1860. WiLLES, J., held, that this, not being expressly men- 

tioned in the covenant, was not connprised within its 
terms, as it was mere matter of ornament. The utmost 
that could be included was the cost of replacing such 
portions of the paper as might be absolutely torn off. 

With regard to the painting, the plaintiff gave evidence 
that it was usual to paint the inside once in seven years, 
and the outside once in three years. 

It was admitted that the whole had been painted in 
1853, and that there had been some repairs in 1858. 

Holly for the plaintiff, contended that this made no dif- 
ference, and that the tenant did not perform his covenant 
merely by repairing the premises when he entered, if whea 
he left them they were not in a good condition. 

On the part of the defendant, the plaintiff&apos;s witnesses 
were cross-examined as to the age of the house, which it 
appeared was 150 years old, and also as to its general 
condition when defendant entered, when it appeared that 
it was rather out of repair; and there was evidence as to 
its being in as good a condition when he left, reasonable 
wear and tear excepted, as it could be after between six 
and seven years&apos; use. 

The money paid into court was proved to be ample enough 
to cover all that could be considered as dilapidations. 

The question was entirely as to the degree of repairs 
required. 

WiLLES, J. (to the jury). — You are to decide the ques- 
tion with reference to the terms of the covenants and the 
general character and condition of the premises when the 
defendant entered. By the covenant the defendant was 
bound to do the things specially mentioned, and also all 
that was necessary to leave the house in a good condition, 
with reference to the obligation of a tenant. As to that, 
you must consider the character and condition of the 
house; thus, if he takes an old house, he must not let it 



SITTINGS- COMMON PLEAS. 



291 



tumble down, he must keep it up; but only as an old 
house. No tenant is bound to leave, for his landlord, a 
new house \ but the house which he took, in a state of fit 
repair, as such house. And if he has painted the outside 
in three years, and the inside within seven years, he is not 
bound to do it again when leaving, unless so far as is 
required by actual dilapidations or destruction of the paint; 
and so of other repairs. He may, if he likes, have the 
benefit of his repairs, so as he leaves the premises in a fit 
state, reasonable wear and tear excepted. If he painted 
and papered within seven years, and there is no damage 
in the Way of breaking down or tearing off, then the 
reasonable construction of the covenant is, that he should 
*&apos; cleanse&quot; the old paint,&amp;c. (or renew it only where tfe- 
stroyed)^ and give up the house in a clean and fair con- 
dition, and for fair wear and tear he would not be liable. 
Questions of this sort are questions of Tact for you, to be 
decided on what are the substantial merits of the case 
fathet- than on strict tights or extreme lelw. The landlord is 
not to claim for every crack in the glass or every scratch 
on the paint. The reasonable rule probably would be not 
to chdrge for a pane of glass merely with one crack in it, 
and so forth. Such covenants must not be strained, but 
reasonably construed, on the principle of &apos;^ give and take.&quot;

It appearing that the only question wag as to the degree 
or amount of repair requisite in the condition of the chancel, 
and a question arising as to the rule of law upon that sub- 
ject, 

WiLLES, J., said, the case of Wise v. Metcalfe (a), which 
IS considered as laying down the law on the subject, really 
does not settle it. It does no more than decide that the 
repairs are to be more than such as a tenant not under 
covenant to repair is bound to do, and less than what a 
tenant under such a covenant is bound to do. The reason- 
able rule is, perhaps, to put the edifice into substantial re- 
pair, without ornament. 

This is a fit case for a reference to arbitration under the 
Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, sect. 3, as a mere 
&apos;&apos; matter of account.*&apos; It is just the kind of case men- 
tioned by the Common Law Commissioners as an illustra-

The plaintiff was examined and stated, that Peel had plaintiff&apos;s cre-

engaged her as a housekeeper at wages of 18/. per annum, 
and that the amount claimed in the action was due. 

Sallantine, Serjt., for the defendants, began to cross- 
examine the plaintiff on the circumstances attending her 
engagement and service, with a view to show that she 
really was engaged as a mistress, and cohabited with Peel 
as such. 

Tozer, Serjt., for the plaintiff, objected. This is not re- 
levant to the issue ; there is no plea that the contract was 
invalid on the ground of its immoral nature; the sole ques- 
tion here is, if the agreement in question was made. 

Erle, C. J. — That is so, but I think it is competent for 
the defendants to put in evidence all the circumstances as 
tending to impeach the general credit of the plaintiff. I 
shall direct the jury, however, that it is not competent to 
them to find for the defendants, on the ground of the im- 
morality of the contract, there being no such plea on the 
record.

regularly paid all the instalments down to the 9th October, 
1860, but bad paid none subsequently. 

It appeared by the record that the action was commenced 
on the 19th October. 

The defendant&apos;s counsel at the close of the opening, in- 
terposed and objected, that at any rate the action was 
brought too soon, as the days of grace were allowable 
upon each instalment, (citing Sherborne v. Orridge{a)j) 
the last instalment being due on 1 6th October, and the 
last day of grace being the 19tb. 

Allen for the plaintiff.*— This question does not arise 
on these pleadings, and it is not open to the defendant to 
raise it. 

AthinBon^ for the defendant, admitted there was no ex-

bill had not become due, but submitted that the declaration 
was informal, and that the defendant had been misled by 
it. He asked for leave to add a plea.

more than one Judge at Chambers

on account of the aversion felt to

was not correct, as will be seen by 
reference to the old forms, which 
always alleged that the bill had bt&apos;- 
come due. And the new forma are 
altered so as to make them accord 
therewith, alleging that the bill is 
&quot;overdue.&quot; In the case alluded to 
it was considered that a denial that 
the bill was due would raise the

The bill bore on it a stamp defaced by Monti, without

It was objected that the bill was not stamped when 
negotiated. The defacement should have been dated. 

Pollock, C. B. — That is so. The object of the statute 
was to prevent the same stamp being used again ; so the 
bill was not duly stamped before it was negotiated. 

Hawkins. — There is no plea to raise the question. 

Pollock, C. B. — A plea is not necessary. The statute

Ballantine, Serjt., called the attorney for the defendant, 
who proved that in another inquiry he had seen the original 
produced from the custody of the now plaintiff; that 
Lewis acted as his attorney in the other action, and that 
copies had been obtained in this action under a Judge&apos;s 
order, which the witness produced and proved to be correct. 

Digby Seymour proposed to call his client, the plaintiff, 
to prove that he had the document from his attorney in 
the other action, Lewis ; but 

PoLXOCK, C. B., declined to admit such evidence. 

Digby Seymour offered to call the plaintiff&apos;s attorney to 
prove that he had not the document in his possession; 
but 

Pollock, C. B., refused to admit the evidence, as it 
would now be irrelevant. 

Digby Seymour contended that the evidence was insuf- 
ficient to admit of secondary evidence, and that the de- 
fendant ought to have subpcenaed Lewis ; but 

Pollock, C. B. — That was not necessary on the evi- 
dence as it stands. If he were present, and had the do- 
cument here, he could no doubt be served with a subpcena 
duces tecum{a). But it is sufficient that notice has been 
given to him to produce the document, he being at this 
moment the plaintiff&apos;s attorney, although not in this action. 
The possession of the plaintiff&apos;s attorney is the possession 
of the plaintiff. Generally, documents of any value are 
in the actual custody of bankers, or attornies or agents of 
some kind ; and though they might perhaps be subpcenaed, 
it is not necessary to snbpcena them ; when the principal 
is a party to the suit, it is sufficient to give the party notice

Poi^iiOCK, C. B. — There is now some evidence of notice

If he could not, then it might be 
held that they advanced the money 
in their own wrong, or must be 
deemed to have done so upon hU 
security; and if so, then as re- 
garded the defendants, his sureties, 
Gatheroood. it would be the same as if the money 
had not been advanced, in which 
case the law would have been the 
same as in Abbott v. Hendrickt, 2 
Sc., N. S. 183, where it was held 
a good plea to an action on a bill 
that it was given for future services 
never rendered. And even as re- 
gards the sureties, the case would 
have resembled Sleigh y. Sleigh, 5 
Exch. 514, where it was held that 
an accommodation acceptor could 
not recover money he paid to a 
holder not entitled to payment by 
reason of want of notice of dis- 
honour. Even assuming that Alpe 
could have sued the plaintiffs for 
refusing the advance, it should seem 
that the damage would have been 



merely nominal or trivial; so in 
the converse case of their suing for 
the loss of profit on the transaction, 
the latter case resembling that of a 
vendor suing for non-acceptance of 
goods sold, for which, if he has 
taken them back, he cannot recover 
the price; Lamond v. Detmlle, 9 
Q. B. 1030; and tlie other case 
being that of vendee suing unpaid 
vendor for the goods; Chinery v. 
Veal, 29 L. J., Exch. 307, from 
which case it seems to result that 
the vendor suing could not have 
recovered on a bill given for the 
price. As to revocation, see Chap- 
pell V. Bray, 30 L. J., Exch. 24, 
and Hotton y. Howiit, ante, p. 233. 
On these grounds Griffili moved 
in H. T., but as half notes had 
been sent {Smith v. Mundy, 29 
L. J., Q. B. 172), and the parties 
could not be put in the same po- 
sition, the Court held the revocation 
too late, and refused a rule.

The plaintiff proved that his daughter had contracted

house, on which the distress was made, and that she had 
entered on the 1 8th May, when a half-quarter*s rent was 
due, viz. 12/. 10^., at the rate of 100/. a year. 

The shop was a double one, and L. continued to occupy 
half for a month afterwards. The plaintiff&apos;s daughter took 
L.&apos;s stock in trade, but had no furniture, and the plaintiff 
supplied the household furniture, residing with her. On 
the 24th June, a quarter&apos;s rent became due. There was an 
agreement negotiated between her and the landlord. P., 
but it was never signed. In August she paid half a quar-

were appraised at 29/. \Sa. 6d. (14/. the furniture and the 
re&amp;t t)ie stock), and offered to her at that price but refused. 
She on the other hand offered to take the furniture at the 
condemned price, but that was refused. The whole of the 
goods, stock and furniture were afterwards (Decenoher 5th) 
noldi after ootice from the plaintiff that the/t^rnt/ure was 
his. It was in respect of the furniture that the present 
action was&apos;brought. 

There was evidence that the stock sold for 40/. aud the 
furniture for 16/., and that the whole was worth 70/« The 
furniture was sold first, and the account, including rent 
and charges 37/., showed a surplus of 19/. There was a 
question as to the charges. 

Coleridge objected, that the action was not maintainable 
by the plaintiff, but 

Martin, B. overruled the objection. 

At the dose of the case, 

Martin, B. — The law is, that, when a distress is sold, 
the seller must stop when he has sold enough to cover rent 
and reasonable charges. The distress must be reasonable, 
and if you think it was unreasonable and excessive find for 
the plaintiff. Was the sale excessive? were the charges 
unreasonable? They amount to forty-five per cent, on the 
amount. Even, however, assuming that the defendant&apos;s 
charges were correct, he sold for nearly 20/. more than 
rent and charges ; that he could not lawfully do without the 
express authority of the plaintiff, which is pleaded* He 
should have sold up to the amount of the rent and proper 
charges, and then have stopped. If he had sold the stock 
first, it turns out that it would have been unnecessary to 
sell further. If that is so, the plaintiff is entitled to recover 
on the first count the value of his goods. As to the

When the case reached its destination it was found 
broken^ and a large rent appeared in one of the pictures. 

It. was not disputed that but for the statute the com- 
pany were liable. 

But when the plaintiff complained of the injury^and the 
increased charge was mentioned as required by the statute, 
he denied all liability to pay it. 

Bramwbll, B., pointed out that, as it appeared that, 
though the nature and value of the goods had been de- 
clared, there had been no payment nor engagement to pay 
the extra charge, the pleadings on the part of tlie plaintiff 
might require amendment (a). 

No application for an amendment, however, was made, 
and at the close of the case, 

Bramwbll, B. (to the jury). — ^The act of parliament, no 
doubt, imposes upon the sender the duty of declaring the 
nature and value, but here there was such a declaration 
to the servant of the company receiving the goods, and I 
think that was sufficient. Then the question arises as to 
the next step. Now I think that the next step should be 
taken by the carrier^ and that it is for him to name and 
demand the extra charge. It is not the duty of the sender 
to tender the extra charge, for he may ncA know the 
amount (ft). Now here no demand was made of any extra 
charge; and therefore, in my view, there was no default in 
not paying it. The only question for you appears to be, 
in the event of the contrary view being taken, whether 
there was any engagement to pay such extra charge ? 

The jury finding that there was not^ and assessed the 
damages at 36/. 

Bramwbll, B. said, the plaintiff was entitled to recover 
on the secotid count, and directed a 

Verdict for the plaintiff, 36/.

ASHCOMBE r. ELLAM, 

Action on a bin of exchange for 100/., drawn by two 
persons naroed Smart upon and accepted by the defendant, 
3rd May, 1858, at sixteen months after date; indorsed by 
them to the plaintiff. 

Pleas : 1. Except as to 50/., that the defendant accepted 
the bill in payment of a certain balance of account of 50/. 
due by him to the drawers, and was induced to accept the 
bill for 100/. instead of 50/. through their fraud. 

Averment, that the plaintiff took and held without con- 
sideration. 

2. Similar, alleging notice to the plaintiff. 

3. Similar, alleging that the plaintiff took the bill over- 
due. 

4. For a defence on equitable grounds (except as to 
50/.), that the bill was drawn for the balance of the pur- 
chase-money of a business,&amp;c., which was 50/., and no 
more ; and that by mistake of the drawers and the de- 
fendant {a) the bill was filled up for 100/. instead of 50/. 

Averment, that there was no other consideration, and 
that the bill was indorsed to the plaintiff overdue, without 
consideration and with notice of the premises. 

5. To the same, that the bill was accepted on condition 
that it should not be negotiated until it was ascertained 
what the balance should be,&amp;c.

SITTINGS-EXCHEQUER. 307 

The issues being on the defendant, he began. 18^^- 

The drawers had sold the defendant a business for 460/., ashcou «■ 
and the bill was given for the balance* The case foi^ the *- 

defendant was, that he had paid them 60L iki March, 
1858, and 350/. tii April, so that only 50/. was due. The 
60/. first paid was before the agreement was finally entered 
into, which was on the 31st March. The defendant allied 
that he bad forgotten the first payment of 60/. when he 
gave the bill in question. 

In the course of proof on the part of the defendant it 
became necessary to show the tefms of the agreement 
actually entered into, which was in wrttii^ by letters be- 
tween him and the drawers, unstamped. 

The question being raised whether they were admissible, 

CflANNBLL, B., said he should hold that they were^ not 
being put in for the purpose of being relied on as an 
agreement, but as part of the proof of an alleged fraud or 
transaction collateral thereto. No doubt the case was on 
the dividing line, and the line was a delicate one to draw, 
the agreement being certainly ** made available,&quot; and as 
evidence; but still it was for a collateral purpose, and 
therefore, he thought, within the cases (a) dispensing with 
stamps, or at least it was so far doubtful that he should 
admit the letters. 

Interrogatories and answers were pill in, which the 
plaintiff swore that he had given ** consideration&quot; for the 
bill, without stating what it was, and that afler pitying him- 
self what might be due to him and a per centage for col- 
lection, he was to pay the balance to tbe drawers. 

At the close of the defendant&apos;s case. 

Hawkins submitted that there was no defence ; and 

Channell, B., said, that, even assuming the defendant&apos;s 
case, there was consideration for the bill proved. 

{a) See these all collected as C. L. P. Act of 1854, Finlason&apos;s 
notes to the stamp clauses of the C. L. P. Acts, Edit. 1860, p. 184.

1860. Keane thereupon called a clerk of the plaintifT, who 

aTcombe P**^^®^ ^^^^ ^&quot; ^^^ 6th September, 1869, the day the bill 

9. became due, it was in possession of the plaintiff; and that 

he knew plaintiff had sold and valued for the drawers, and 

did not know of any debt from them to him. 

Channell, B., said he was prepared to rule that there 
was no case for the defendant, but if the plaintiff went 
into evidence he should leave the whole case to the jury. 

Keane called the plaintiff, who admitted that the drawers&apos; 
debt to him was under 20/. 

Channell, B., thought that though the evidence showed 
that the consideration was less than 50/., the plaintiff was 
a trustee for the drawers for the balance, and that the de- 
fendant could not on the pleadings claim to keep back any 
part of the 100/. 

Keane submitted that the plea was divisible, but ap- 
plied to amend if necessary. 

Channell, B., after consulting Pollock, C. B., said 
the case must go on, and he would amend if necessary. 

Keane applied to amend the plea, if necessary, by 
making it deny any consideration exceeding SOL 

Hawkins then called the drawers, and went into evi- 
dence. 

There was a contest as to whether the defendant had 
paid them 350/. or 300/. on the second occasion. 

Channell, B., left that question to the jury, who found 
that the defendant had only paid 300/. 

Verdict for the plaintiff for 100/. and interest.

Beale. The contract was — &quot; all rent due to Lady •day

let the plaintiff into possession before any assignment was 
executed, and the landlord, in July, put in a distress for 
rent due up to Lady-day, which the plaintiff paid, and 
which was the money now sought to be recovered. The 
defendant knew the rent was due. 

Hawkins submitted that there was no case ; that there 
was no note in writing to answer for the debt of another, 
and that the plaintiff had no right to enter. 

Martin, B. — ^The agent having authority to let, had 
authority to let him in. The defendant is liable. He was 
bound to indemnify the plaintiff. The rent was due and 
he knew of it, and the plaintiff was forced to pay it. That 
supports a claim for money paid to his use.

The defendant was, in the course of proving his plea,

It was, and there was a letter taken by the defendant to T.&amp;Co., in the name of the plaintiff, in these terms :— 

*^ I hereby agree that Mr. Mowbray shall pay to T. Ic

payment of the accounts between him and T.&amp;Co., for

There was a memorandum written on this in the name of i860. 
T. k Co. in these terms : — 

&quot;We hereby agree to receive the money as stated on 
the other side, from Mr, Mowbray, as part payment of our 
claim against Mr. Webb, and acquit Mr. Mowbray from 
further responsibility on account of Mn Webb.&quot; 

This letter was taken to T.&amp;Co. by the defendant, he 
saying, ** Get this signed by Webb, and sign this other your- 
selves.&quot; The defendant did not see T.&amp;Co. or the plaintiff, 
but next day the papers were sent by T.&amp;Co., signed by 
Webb and by themselves. 

T. Jones proposed, after putting these papers in, to 
prove that the defendant had acted on the alleged agree* 
ment, and was willing to hold himself liable to T.&amp;Co., 
and with that view, the papers not being stamped, offered 
to have them stamped, but 

Martin, B., thought that they could not prove the 
pleas, there being no agreement in writing by Mowbray 
the defendant. 

T. Jones submitted, that it was not necessary that there 
should be a written agreement. 

Martin, B. — That might be, but here, if it was intended 
that there should be a written agreement, there would be 
no final binding agreement until the parties signed (a). 

T. Jones, — ^The accounts between T.&amp;Co. and the de- 
fendant had not been finally adjusted or the money 
would have been paid, but the defendant became liable 
to them, so the agreement was executed. 

Martin, B. — I think the defence is not made out; but 
the documents may be taken as having been put in (6), 
subject to the payment of the penalty, if necessary.

I860. The plaintiff being in the hox, 

Huddleston was cross-examining as to the contents of 
documents which there had been no notice to produce; and 

Sir W. Atherton, S. G., objected ; but 

Pollock, C. B. — When one of the parties to the suit is 
being cross-examined, the rules of evidence, as to notice 
to produce and otherwise, are somewhat altered, and you 
may get anything you can from them (a). 

There was evidence given on the part of the plaintiff to 
negative the statements in the affidavit of the defendant, 
and some of them were contradicted. 

At the close of the plaintiff&apos;s case, 

Huddleston objected, that the former action being stitl 
pending, the present action was premature. 

Sir W. Atherton, S. G., answered, that as the amount 
paid into Court was above 20/., the debt was sufficiently 
admitted ; and that, as to the other elements of the case, 
the result of the first action could not possibly affect the 
question to be tried in the present one, which depended 
upon probable cause for belief that the plaintiff had in- 
tended to go abroad. 

Pollock, C. B., so far acceded to this view that he de- 
clined to stop the action, though he said he was disposed 
to think that such an action ought not to be brought until 
the former action was concluded. 

Huddleston contended that there was no evidence of 
malice, and that there was reasonable and probable cause 
for making an affidavit of the plaintiff&apos;s intention to go 
abroad. 

Sir W. Atherton, S.G., urged that there were fafee state- 
ments in the affidavit.

Pollock, C, B. — I am inclined to think that there is no i860, 
evidence of malice^ bat that 1 shall leave to the jury. If 
the facts are, as stated by defendant, I shall rule that 
there was reasonable and probable cause for making the 
affidavit. The defendant received information frond at least 
one person, which was reasonably sufficient to justify the 
application. And as to the truth or falsehood of the affi- 
davit io other respects, that depends on the whole of the 
evidence. The nuvU)cr of instances would not be material, 
if on any one there was reasonable cause, as I think there 

was.

of hops,&amp;c. J. Durrell. (Signed) J. N., for Noakes&amp;Co.&quot; 
The defendants, however, declined to receive the hops, and 
retained the samples. 

The case for the plaintiff was, that Noakes k Co. acted 
as brokers for both parties. 

Hawkins objected that there was no note in writing 
&apos;* signed by the parties to be charged,&apos;&apos; or any agent on 
their behalf; that the notes made no contract, as they 
differed ; that they merely amounted to invoices ; and that 
there was no evidence that Noakes&amp;Co. acted as brokers 
for both parties. And he offered to adduce evidence that 
in the trade it was understood that the hop factor acted 
only for the grower, and not as broker for the buyer. 

Pollock, C. B., doubted if such evidence was necessary 
or admissible, and was of opinion that on the evidence, 
even as it stood, it was manifest that Noakes&amp;Co. had 
acted for the plaintiff, and not for the defendants; but, 
with his Lordship&apos;s permission, 

Hawkins called one or two witnesses to prove the under- 
standing in the trade; and then,

18dO. On this proof, it was proposed by the counsel for the 

prosecution to have the deposition read in evidence.* 

Pricey for the prisoner, then cross-examined the wit- 
ness, and elicited that the prosecutor had been twice before 
the magistrates. On the morning of the 9th of October, 
when the witness apprehended the prisoner and took him 
before the magistrates, the prosecutor then made his state- 
ment, and no deposition was then taken, and the hearing 
of the case was adjourned. Afterwards the deposition was 
made out in the town hall ; he believed it was taken be^ 
fore the magistrates, but he could not undertake to swear 
that it had not been written out in another room by the 
magistrate&apos;s clerk, and read over and signed afterwards by 
the prosecutor. He believed it was taken before the ma- 
gistrates. 

Price submitted that the deposition was not admissible, 
as if taken in another room and not before the magistrate, 
«it was not taken conformably with the statute; and if his 
Lordship had any doubt about the facts, he would call Mr. 
Chambers, the attorney, who appeared for the prisoner 
before the magistrates, who would prove that the deposi- 
tion had been taken in another room. He referred to 
12. V. Smith (a), as establishing that the deposition must 
be taken in the presence of the prisoner, so that he might 
have an opportunity of cross-examining the witness. He 
referred also to the authorities collected in Archbold&apos;s 
Criminal Law(i) to the same e ect. Here the prisoner 
had not had that opportunity of cross-examination, and be 
submitted that the deposition was not admissible. 

Campbell Foster submitted that the deposition was 
clearly admissible under the statute on the policeman&apos;s 
evidence ; and even if the facts were as suggested on the

other side, and the deposition had been taken in an ad- i860, 
joining room after the examination before the magistrate 
by the magistrate&apos;s clerk, and afterwards read over to the 
witness and signed by him in the presence of the prisoner, 
although this practice was one which had been condemned, 
it would not render the deposition inadmissible. He re- 
ferred to Reg, V. Calvert and Other8{a\ where a deposition 
taken in an adjoining room to that in which the magistrate 
sat, by the clerk in the prisoner&apos;s presence, and afterwards 
read over in the presence of the prisoner, the witness being 
then sworn to the truth of the deposition was admitted by 
Mr. Baron Rolfb, although he condemned the practice. 

Hill, J., said, the facts were for him, and he was not 
satisfied as to the mode in which the deposition had been 
really taken from the evidence of the policeman. It might 
turn out that it had not been taken in accordance with the 
statute. He would hear what evidence Mr. Price had on 
this point. 

Price then called Mr. Chambers, the attorney for the 
prisoner, who stated that on the 9th of October, he attended 
before the magistrates as attorney for the prisoner, when 
he was first before the magistrates. Both the prisoner and 
prosecutor were present ; the prosecutor made a statement 
to the magistrate which was not taken down in writing. 
He asked the prosecutor a few questions in cross-examina- 
tion, and those questions were not taken down in writing. 
The case was then adjourned to the following day, when 
the prisoner was again brought up before the same magis- 
trate. The prosecutor was again sworn, and Mr. Smith, 
the magistrate&apos;s clerk, read over to the prosecutor a written 
deposition which had been taken previously to the second 
hearing. Witness cross-examined the prosecutor, and that 
cross-examination, or some part of it, was taken down by 
Mr. Smith, and from his notes it was afterwards copied,

His LoBDSHip. — A fair copy ? 

Witness. — Yes, a fair copy of the cross-examination 
taken down on the copy, which had been previously read. 

His Lordship said, on this evidence he should hold 
that the deposition was admissible in evidence. In the 
London police offices, where a great number of charges 
were daily heard, it was the constant practice to have the 
abbreviated notes taken during the examination of a witness 
by the magistrate&apos;s clerk, fair copied, in full, in an adjoin- 
ing room, and that copy afterwards read over in the pre- 
sence of the prisoner, and signed by the witness ; and the 
business of these offices could not otherwise be carried on. 
He thought such a practice not only convenient but within 
the spirit and intention of the statute, as the prisoner had 
fiill opportunity as well as the witness of objecting, if the 
evidence were put down incorrectly. 

The deposition was then given in evidence. 

The prisoner was aflerwards acquitted on 
the facts proved.

The prisoner was a lodging-house keeper and account- 
ant, residing at Filey, and the prosecutrix a grocer and 
provision dealer living in the same town. The prosecutrix 
had supplied the prisoner with provisions to the amount of 
13/. I2s. 9d,, and being unable to get payment of her debt 
had sued the prisoner in the County Court and obtained 
judgment for her debt and costs in December, 1869. The 
amount recovered not having been paid according to the 
order of the Court, the prisoner was served with a sum- 
mons upon the judgment in January, 1860, and ordered to 
be committed for forty days, unless the debt and costs were 
paid within a month. The debt was not paid and the 
prisoner kept out of the way, but through his wife induced 
the prosecutrix to accept 47. in part payment, and the re- 
mainder in four months. An agreement to that effect 
drawn out by the prisoner, and with a receipt at the bottom 




322 CASES ON THE 

1860. for 47. was submitted to the prosecutrix, who took a copy 
of it, and she agreeing to it, received the 4/. and signed 
the receipt, which the prisoner&apos;s wife took away. The 
execution of the warrant was then suspended for four 
months, at the expiration of which time the balance of the 
debt and costs not having been paid, the bailiff of the 
County Court was directed to put in force the suspended 
warrant, when the prisoner produced tb him the agreement 
copied above, on receiving which the bailiff discharged 
him out of custody, conceiving he had no power to detain 
him. On inspecting the agreement it was found that the 
words inserted between brackets, and which were not in 
the original agreement, had been introduced in it in the 
prisoner&apos;s handwriting, the effect of which was to reduce the 
balance of the debt and costs remaining due by 6/. 10^., 
namely, from 13/. ISs. 8d. to 71. ds. 8d., and to postpone 
the paypaent of the sard balance to the 13th of September, 
1861, or nearly a year and five months instead of for four 
months as agreed upon. This alteration of the document 
was the forgery, with which the prisoner was charged. 
He was indicted under the stat. 1 1 Geo. 4&amp;1 Will. 4, 
c. 66, ss. 3, 10, in the first count, with feloniously forging 
a certain agreement, purporting to be made between Ma- 
tilda Archer and the prisoner, (setting out the above docu- 
ment verbatim,) with intent to defraud. 

A second count charged him with feloniously forging a 
certain agreement, purporting to be made between the said 
John Wright and Matilda Archer, with intent to defraud. 

A third count charged the prisoner with feloniously 
&apos;&apos; altering a certain undertaking for the payment of 
money&quot; (describing the agreement), with intent thereby 
to defraud. 

A fourth count charged him with feloniously foiling and 
altering a certain &apos;^acquittance and receipt for the payment 
of money,&quot; with intent thereby to defraud. 

There were four other similar counts, charging an utter- 




NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 323 

ing of the documents described as above, knowing them i860, 
to be forgedy with intent thereby to defraud. 

Price, for the prisoner, submitted as to the first two 
counts, that the document charged to be forged was not an 
agreement 

Hill, J., directed his attention to the third and fourth 
counts. 

Then as to the third count, this was not an undertaking 
for the payment of money within the meaning of the sta- 
tute. If anything, it was an undertaking by the prose- 
cutriK to forbear pressing for payment. 

Hill, J. — I am quite clear that it is not an undertak- 
ing for the payment of money. The prosecutrix does not 
undertake to pay anything. 

Price submitted also that this was not a forgery of ** an 
acquittance and receipt for the payment of money,&apos;&apos; under 
the fourth count. So far as it purported to be a receipt 
or acquittance for 4/. it was not a forgery but a true docu- 
ment. 

Campbell Foster for the prosecution. As to the fourth 
count submitted that the document, if it could be described 
by any term, was rightly described as an &apos;&apos; acquittance 
and receipt for the payment of money.&quot; The effect of the 
alteration in the document was &apos;* to acquit&quot; the prisoner of 
61. IO5. of the sum that he owed and make it appear that 
the prosecutrix assented to his debt being reduced from 
13/. I3s. 8d. after the payment of the 4/., to 71. 3$. 8d. He 
referred to Reg. v. Vaughan (a), where an alteration in a 
document, varying the amount for which a receipt was 
given, was held to be a forgery of the receipt* 

HtLL, J., said in that case there had been an alteration 
in the sum for which the receipt was given. In this case 
there was no alteration in the sum for which the receipt

324 CASES ON THE 

I860. was given by the prosecutrix. If the document were a 
foi^ery at all, it was a forgery at common law, and the 
prisoner could only be indicted for the common law mis- 
demeanor (a). In the present case he was indicted under 
the statute for a felony; there must therefore be an ac- 
quittal. 

Campbell Foster then submitted, his Lobdship haying 
so held, that an acquittal should be taken on the third and 
fourth counts, and on the corresponding counts for utter- 
ing, and he would then ask his Lordship to amend the 
first and second counts and the corresponding counts for 
uttering, by striking out the word &quot; feloniously.** He sub- 
mitted that, under the 14&amp;15 Vict. c. 100, s. 1, his Lord- 
ship had the power to do this. He admitted that the 
application was a novel one, and he was not aware of any 
authority going to this extent; but the statute was recent, 
and the words of the section giving the power of amend- 
ment in certain cases to the Court seemed large enough to 
embrace the present case : — &quot; Whenever on the trial of 
any felony or misdemeanor there shall appear to be any 
variance between the statement in such indictment and the 
evidence offered in proof thereof in,&amp;c.,&amp;c.&quot; (setting forth 
a number of things), ** or in the name or description of 
any matter or thing whatsoever therein named or described&quot; 
then &apos;^it shall be lawful for the Court* before which the 
trial shall be had, if it shall consider such variance not 
material to the merits of the case, and that the defendant 
cannot be prejudiced thereby in his defence on such merits, 
to order such indictment to be amended,&quot; On this trial, 
his Lordship having held that the document on which the 
prisoner was indicted amounted only to a forgery at com- 
mon law, which was a misdemeanor, whereas it was stated

NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 325 

in the counts in the indictment referred to, to be a *&apos; felo- I860, 
nioua&quot; forging, this was a variance &apos;* in the description of 
a matter or thing therein named or described&quot; which his 
Lordship had power under this section to amend, as the 
description clearly was not material to the merits of the 
case. 

Hill, J. — Show me an authority where the Court has 
made an amendment altering the quality of the offence 
found by the grand jury from a felony to a misdemeanor. 

Campbell Faster admitted that he was not aware of any 
such case. The application raised a new question, which 
he submitted, under the statute, his Lordship had power 
to decide, by making the amendment if he saw fit. 

Hill, J., said he should hesitate before making such a ^ 
precedent, as altering the offence charged was altering the 
offence found by the grand jury. He also referred to the 
third paragraph in the note of Mr. Greaves on this section 
of the statute : — &quot; As this section originally stood, imme- 
diately after the words &apos; persons whatsoever therein named 
or described,&apos; followed the general words, &apos; or any variance 
between such statement and the evidence offered in proof 
in any other matter or thing whatsoever.&apos; These words 
were objected to as being too general, and struck out on 
that ground in the House of Lords.*&apos; He should not there- 
fore be the first to make such an amendment (a). 

The prisoner was therefore acquitted. 

(a) In tlietaraenoteMr.Greavei as cases precisely witbin the same 
says, ^ The taking out of the gene- mischief as those provided for will

and that he gave money to individual voters to induce them 
to vote for his cousin. The borough of Wakefield owed 
its franchise to the Reform Bill, and its electors were un- 
mixed, and composed entirely of 10/. householders. The 
candidates were Mr. Leatham, who had been a banker at 



NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 



327 



Wakefield^ and a member of a well-known firm there, and 
Mr. John Dodgson Charlesworth. The nomination-day 
for the election was fixed for the 28th of April, 1859, and 
at the election, on the show of hands, Mr. Leathara had 
the majority. A poll being demanded, the polling was 
fixed to commence next day, the 29th of April. The result 
of the poll was that Mr. Leatham was returned by the 
narrow majority of three votes, the numbers being 406 for 
Leatham and 403 for Charlesworth. The contest was a 
▼ery severe one, and a very active canvass was carried on 
for several days. Mr. Leatham*s opponents, being dis- 
satisfied with the result of the election, presented a petition 
to Parliament against the return, which was referred to a 
select committee, who decided that Mr. Leatham&apos;s was not 
a. good seat, and in addition reported to the House of 
Commons that corrupt practices extensively prevailed at 
the election. The Act of Parliament under which that 
report was made, the 15&amp;16 Vict. c. 57, was an Act to 
provide for a more effectual inquiry into corrupt practices 
at elections. The substance of the provisions of that Act 
were, that upon a report made by a Parliamentary com- 
mittee, followed by an address from each of the two Houses 
of Parliament to her Majesty, a commission might issue to 
inquire into any corrupt practices at an election. Under 
such a commission the commissioners had very large 
powers ; persons were bound to answer, and no answer so 
given could in any legal proceedings be made use of after- 
wards against them, and more than that, if persons 
answered in such a manner as to satisfy the commissioners 
that they had made a full disclosure, the commissioners 
had authority to issue a certificate, which was a protection 
to the person receiving it against any penal or legal conse- 
quences arising from the evidence so given. A commission, 
in the present case was issued, and the commissioners ap- 
pointed were Mr. Serjeant Pigott, Mr. Henry Willes and 
Mr. Wyndham Slade. Among other persons, they called

&apos;^&apos; He failed to satisfy the commissioners that he had made a

o. full disclosure, and they in consequence refused to give 

Charles- ^^^&amp;Certificate. Of course, no statement would be given 
in evidence against him that he had made; but the evi- 
dence against him would be confined to facts to be proved, 
apart fi&apos;om his own evidence. The defendant&apos;s cousin was 
one of the candidates at the election. The first step taken 
by the defendant was a proceeding which took place on 
the lOth of April, a fortnight before the election. On that 
day the defendant waited on Messrs. Beckett, the bankers, 
at Leeds, and delivered to Mr. Beckett two documents, — 
one a letter from Mr. John Dodgson Charlesworth, and 
the other a debenture of the Stockton and Darlington 
Railway Company for 6,000Z. The letter was dated : — 

&quot; Hatfield Hall. 
&quot; Gentlemen, — My cousin, Mr. J. B. Charlesworth, is 
wishful to open an account at your bank. I have given 
him a debenture on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, 
which he will deliver to you. 

*&apos; J. Dodgson Charlesworth.&quot; 
Mr. John Dodgson Charlesworth had an account at the 
bank before then ; but Mr. John Barff Charlesworth had 
not. He would now state how the great bulk of that sum 
of 6,000/., namely, 4,600/., was withdrawn from the bank. 
The defendant took his cheque to the bank, and received 
into his own hands, on the 16tb of April, 1,000/.; on the 
23rd of April, in the same way, he received 1,000/.; on 
the 27th of April, 1,600/.; on the 29th of April, 600/.; 
on the 3rd of May, 260/.; and on the 6th of May, 600/. 
On the very days when he had drawn these large sums he 
had paid them over to Mr. Femandes, a friend and partisan 
of Mr. John Dodgson Charlesworth, with the exception of 
two sums of 600/. each. Mr. Femandes was a gentleman 
in good position in the borough of Wakefield, a corn mer- 
chant, and an alderman of the borough. The proposal that 



NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 



329 



these funds should be placed in Mr. Fernandes&apos;s hands had 
emanated from that gentleman. He had paid to a person 
named Alder 35/.^ and on other occasions he had paid to 
that person 1,000/. between the 20th and the 30th of April. 
Alder was a corn factor&apos;s clerk at Wakefield. A gentle- 
man named Shaw had received 40/. from Mr. Fernandes. 
A person named Moore, a stranger from Bishop Auckland, 
had received a sum of 535/. A person named Stephenson 
had received 226/.; 100/. had been paid to a gentleman 
named Serle; 26/. had been paid to a man named Bendon; 
19/. to a man named Tack, and various other sums amount- 
ing to 459/. These payments were made for purposes 
connected with that election. He had omitted to mention 
a person named Brear, who had received 1,400/. from Mr. 
Fernandes in three several payments. The evidence as to 
Brear was very important when they came to consider with 
what object the money was paid to Mr. Fernandes, and 
whether it was not given to him to be spent in bribery by 
the defendant. Brear was a maltster at Wakefield, and a 
very active partisan. He informed Mr. Fernandes on the 
22nd of April, just a week before the election, that &apos;&apos; the 
other side were bribing right and left, and unless some- 
thing were done the election would be lost,&quot; and wished 
that money should be given to him. Immediately after 
this conversation Fernandes delivered to Mr. Brear 500/., 
and subsequently other sums. Unfortunately Brear had 
died. His evidence would have been important as to the 
giving of bribes to particular voters, but not in any other 
way. The charge against the defendant was, that he had 
advanced and paid money to Mr. Fernandes with the 
intent that that money, or some part thereof, should be 
expended in bribery at the then Wakefield election. All 
the money given in bribes, to the amount of 1,400/., they 
traced as given through Brear, and in one case, from him, 
through a man named Whitehead. The first person to 
whom it would be proved a bribe was given was a person

named William Wells, a tailor, in Wood Street, in Wake- 
field, and it was to be observed that the recipients of these 
bribes were not in the lowest class; they seemed to be 
tradesmen in fair and respectable business. Notwith- 
standing that, they had received bribes and were open to 
receive bribes. In some instances they had kept faith with 
their bargain. In others they either did not vote at all, or 
voted on the other side. Wells had received 40/. for his 
vote, and had voted accordingly. The next person was 
Samuel GifTard, a tailor, in the Market Street. He had 
received for his vote two sums of 15Z. to vote for Charles- 
worth. He had voted for Mr. Leatham; he had been 
guilty of the additional wickedness of receiving a bribe 
and then voting on the other side. The next was a person 
named Willcock, who was a gardener carrying on business 
in Wakefield, who had received 30/. On the day of the 
election he had taken his vegetables to the market, and 
never voted at all. There was a man named Moore, a 
stranger iii the town, whose pedigree nobody could trace, 
and who was called the ** Man in the Moon.&quot; He was 
thought to move about and dispose of money in a way 
which nobody could trace. He had received a sum of 
500/., and out of that he had paid to Mr. Lang, innkeeper, 
a sum of 50/., and he did not vote at all. Next came a 
Thomas Stead, a shopkeeper, in Northgate, Wakefield, 
who had received 60/., which was paid to him by Dan 
Robinson, an understrapper to the &apos;&apos; Man in the Moon.&apos;&apos; 
The money was thus traced to Moore, from him to Fer- 
nandes, and from him to the defendant and to Beckett&apos;s 
bank, where it had been placed by Mr. J. D. Cbarlesworth, 
the candidate. These were the facts which would be laid 
before them. His duty was to make out the intent with 
which the money so paid was advanced to Mr. Fernandes. 
The learned counsel then proceeded to contend that the 
various facts connected with the advance of this money 
left no doubt that the intention with which it was so

advanced was for the purposes of bribery at the then elcc- J 860. 
tion for Wakefield. None of these expenses had been rj-qina 
sanctioned by the election auditor^ and if the facts were v- 

established by proof it would be the duty of the jury to Charles. 
return a verdict of&quot; guilty.&quot; 

Formal proof was then given of the issuing of a writ for 
the election of a member for Wakefield on the 23rd of 
April, 1859, and of the register of voters. The number of 
voters in the borough was 952; the candidates were 
Leatham and Charlesworth. The nomination day was 
Friday, the 29th of April ; Leatham had the show of 
hands, and a poll was demanded for Charlesworth on the 
following day. On the 2nd of May, Leatham was de- 
clared at the head of the poll, the votes being 406 for 
Leatham and 403 for Charlesworth. The accounts of the 
election auditor of Cbarlesworth&apos;s expenses amounted to 
634/. 

Proof was then given that Mr. J. D. Charlesworth bad 
deposited a debenture for 5,000Z. as security at Messrs. 
Beckett&amp;Co.&apos;s bank, at Leeds, who, at his request by 
letter, had opened an account with the defendant, who had 
drawn out 4,750/. at various times during April and May, 
by cheque, the sums ranging from 1,500/. to 250/., which 
had been paid to the defendant himself. 

Jose Louis Fernandes, examined. — Is a corn merchant 
in Wakefield. Has been many years so, and four years 
an alderman of that borough. Witness declined to an- 
swer whether he had taken an active part in municipal 
and parliamentary elections for the borough of Wakefield. 

The JuDGB said, no possible answer he could give to 
that question could criminate himself. 

Answer. — I have. Have known J. B. Charlesworth, 
the defendant, for many years. I also know J. D. 
Charlesworth. Was on terms of intimacy and friendship 
with both. They are in partnership as colliery owners.

The defendant was bred to the bar. Witness declined to 
say whether he remembered the election of 1859. 

His Lordship. — You must answer that, sir ; you are 
asked only the fact. 

Witness. — Certainly, he remembered it Was in Wake- 
field during the election. He knew Mr. J. D. Charles- 
worth was a candidate. Witness was an elector, and 
voted for Charlesworth. He recollected the nomination 
and poll. He declined to say whether he received any 
sums of money from defendant in April, 1869. 

His Lordship said the objection might be well founded. 

The witness said he was examined by the commissioners 
at Wakefield and received a certificate. 

Sir F. Kelly objected to the question, but withdrew 
the objection, as the question was for the decision of the 
Judge. 

The certificate was handed to his Lordship, who 
asked for the production of the commission. He then said 
he would consult Mr. Justice Keating as to whether the 
witness was compellable to answer the question or not. 
On his return. 

His Lordship said : Witness, I am bound to tell you 
that my brother Keating and myself have considered this 
question calmly, whether you can be exposed to any peril, 
and we are both of opinion that you are free from all 
penal actions, penal disabilities and criminal prosecutions 
of every kind and sort, for any matter relating to that 
election, and having formed that opinion, on full consider- 
ation, I am bound to tell you that it is your duty to 
answer that question. 

Witness. — I have taken the opinions of Mr. Jones and

cate is not a sufficient indemnity from an impeachment of

The SoUciior^ General — Yoar Lordship hua heard my 
Btatement of this case, and must be aware not only how 
importanti but how indispeasable, the evideoce of this wit-

His Lordship (to the witness). — Have you considered 
well that you are placed in no peril by answering that 
question ? Do you still decline to answer? 

Witness. — I decline to answer it. 

His Lordship (to the Solidtor-Oeneral). — Do you press 
the question ? 

The SolidtOT&apos;Qeneral. — Yes, my Lord. 

His LeRDSHip. — Then, witness, I have no other course 
than to adjudge you guilty of a contempt of Court, of no 
ordinary character. Your evidence being material to the 
question before the Court, you, well knowing what would 
be its effect, have sought to withhold evidence necessary 
to the due administration of justice, and you have done so, 
imagining, perhaps, that you stand in no peril. What yon 
have done is to thwart the due administration of justice, 
and I sentence you to be imprisoned for your contempt, 
unless sooner discharged by competent authority, for six 
calendar months, and to pay a fine of 500/., and to be im- 
prisoned till that fine is paid. 

The witness was then delivered over into the custody of 
the governor of York Castle, and ordered to be confined 
among the first-class misdemeanants. 

The learned Solicitor^ General then said il was impos- 
sible to move a step in either case against the two 
Charlesworths without the evidence of this witness; but 
he asked his Lordship not to go so far as to direct an 
acquittal for want of evidence, but simply to discharge the 
jury. In support of this request the Solicitor-Oeneral re- 
ferred to the case of Re Netoton (a), where a prisoner was

His Lordship held that case not sufficient. That case 
and many others had recently been considered before him. 
The discretion of the Judge in such a case ought not to be 
exercised, except in case of necessity. In the case referred 
to the assizes were over, and it was necessary to go on to 
the next assize town. Was there any case in which it had 
been held that the Judge ought to exercise that discretion 
by reason of a witness breaking down ? 

There was a case where a prisoner fell down fainting, and 
was assisted out of Court (a) ; where a jury was discharged. 
He remembered a case which had occurred before Mr. 
Justice Crbsswell, on the Northern Circuit, where a young 
girl, placed in the witness-box, fainted, and the case could 
not go on. He had the jury locked up for the night. He 
was disposed to discharge them, but had great doubts 
about it. 

The Solicitor &apos;General said there was a case of Rex v. 
Stokes (Jb), whera a jury was discharged by the Judge on 
the ground of the absence of a witness for the prosecution, 
at the request of the prisoner&apos;s counsel. 

His LoRDSHiP.~-In that case, after the prisoner was 
given in charge to the jury, and before anything was done, 
it was held, that if for any reason whatever a prisoner 
wishes it, the jury may be discharged.

heap of straw then being iu and upon the said land near |5^&apos; 
to the said premises, and by means thereof the said heap f&amp;bmantle 
of straw then became ignited and set on fire, and by fire ^ /*

whilst the same were so respectively occupied as aforesaid, Railwat 
and the reversion thereof respectively so belonged to the 
plaintiff, became ignited and set on fire, and were there- 
upon and by means of the premises wholly burnt, con- 
sumed and destroyed. 

The only plea was that of not guilty. 

The plaintiff was the landlord of premises called Moor 
Farm, in the parish of Swanbourne, in the county of 
Bucks, which were destroyed in the afternoon of the 2nd 
of May, 1860, by fire. The premises consisted of the usual 
fiirm-buildings and a rick-yard. The fire broke out in the 
rick-yard, in a stack of wheat-straw, which was distant 
forty-three feet fix&gt;m the defendants* railway. The general 
disposition of tlie premises, so far as relates to the rick- 
yard, was the sane at the time of the fire as it was before 
the construction of tlie railway, but the stack of wlieat- 
straw bad only recently been placed where it tlieii was. 

Numerous witnesses were called on either side. 

His LoitDSHiP, in summing up, told the jury that, since 
the legislature had thought fit to authorize the use of loco- 
motive engines on railways, the companies who under that 
authority use on their lines these engines, calculated as 
they are to interfere in some respects with the ordinary 
rights of enjoyment of property by others, are yet not re- 
sponsible for the consequences of so using them, provided 
they are qot guilty of any negligence, either in respect of 
the proper construction or the proper furniture of their 
engines, or in respect of the proper use and conduct of 
them when they shalt have been so properly constructed 
or furnished. 

lliat there would be two questions, therefore| for their 
consideration. Ftrst Was the fire occasioned by a spark

or cinder that was emitted from the defendants* engine ? 
And, if so, was the emission attributable to any negligence 
on the part of the company or their servants, either in the 
construction, furniture, or condition of the engine, or in the 
use or management of it ? 

It must, therefore, be considered what would be negli- 
gence on the part of the defendants, for the consequences 
of which they ought (o be held responsible. That, as to 
that, the defendants, in the construction of their engines, 
were bound, not only to employ all due care and all due 
skill for the prevention of mischief accruing to the property 
of others, by the emission of sparks or any other causes, 
but they were bound to avail themselves of all the dis- 
coveries which science had put within their reach for that 
purpose, provided that they were such as, under the cir- 
cumstances, it was reasonable to require them to adopt. 
For example, if the danger to be avoided were insignificant, 
or very unlikely to occur, and the remedy suggested were 
very costly or troublesome, or such as interfered materially 
with the efficient working of the engine, then tlie jury 
would have to say whether it could reasonably be expected 
that the defendants should adopt such a remedy for such 
an evil. On the other hand, they were to consider the 
nature of the contrivances suggested, which principally 
consisted of the &quot; bonnet&quot; placed on the top of the chim- 
ney, or immediately inside of it, the perforated grating, the 
Venetian blinds and the American spark-catcher. Upon 
the question whether there was any negligence imputable 
to the defendants by reason of not having adopted any one 
of these remedies, these considerations were proper for the 
guidance of the jury. If, according to the suggestion of 
the plaintif}&apos;, they thought that with such an engine as that 
in question the risk of causing mischief by the emission of 
sparks was not improbable, and the danger of causing that 
mischief not unlikely to occur, then they would say whether 
it was not reasonable to require that the defendants should

resort to some one of these protections, which were adr i860, 
mitted by the defendants&apos; witnesses to be usefifl in the case p)]^^*|[^g 
of an engine which does emit sparks which are likely to v. 

produce mischief. If they should, if the risk were con- and North- 
siderable, and if the expense or trouble or inconvenience rai&quot;w\y 
of providing a remedy were not great in proportion to the Company. 
risk, then they would have to say whether the company 
could reasonably be excused from availing themselves of 
such a remedy, because it might to some extent be attended 
with cost or other disadvantage to themselves. On the 
first question these considerations were not of any very 
great importance; but if they found that question in favor 
of the plaintiff, namely, that the fire was caused by the 
engine of the defendants, then they would have to consider 
whether, in this case, there was negligence on the part of 
the defendants in not adopting some of the contrivances, 
and if they should also be of opinion that the escape of the 
sparks from the engine was fairly attributable to the want 
of that precaution being taken, then they would give a 
verdict for the plaintiff. If, on the other hand, they were of 
opinion, in accordance with the evidence of the defendants, 
that it was a highly improbable and most remote contin- 
gency that any lighted cinder could be ejected Trom an 
engine so constructed, then they would have to say whether 
it was reasonable that the defendants should be required to 
resort for a remedy to contrivances which, according to 
their evidence, would materially interfere with the working 
efficiency of the engine; and the jury would have to say 
whether any negligence was fairly imputable to the de- 
fendants by reason of having omitted to adopt a remedy 
under such circumstances. 

The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff.

jg^^^^ case, his Lordship was requested by the counsel for the 

e. defendants to take the opinion, of the jury whether the 

AMD North- plaintiff had not been guilty of negligence in placing the 

RiiiLWAir 8^^!^ of wheat-straw so near to the railway. 

His Lordship said tliat he had no reluctance in pro- 
claiming that he did not think the answer to that question 
was material to the case. It was contended that the plain- 
tiff was aware that engines sent out sparks, and that they 
had proved destructive to agricultural produce and were 
likely to do so; and therefore it was on the plaintiff&apos;s part 
an act of culpable negligence to place his straw-stack in a 
situation exposed to danger. It would be desirable, how- 
ever, for the purpose of future discussion, to answer the 
question, first, whether the plaintiff was guilty of culpable 
negligence in placing the straw-stack so close to the rail- 
road ? and if so, did that culpable negligence contribute to 
the accident ? 

The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff 
in this case also, and said that he was not 
guilty of culpable negligence in placing the 
stack where it stood when the fire occurred.

prisoner in this case was indicted for forgery. It T*&gt;« prisoner 
appeared from the evidence that he was a clerk in the em- whose duty it 
ployment of Messrs. Harriifon, a firm carrying on business money^^oTLc- 
at Hull and Wisbech. The prisoner resided at Wisbech, coumif hU 

r &apos; employers, to 

and, together with one Carter, had the management of that pay wages and 

part of Messrs. Harrison&apos;s business which was carried on outofit,andto 

there. An account was kept by the firm at Messrs. Gurney b^ance&apos;to their 

Ic Peckover&apos;s bank in Wisbech, to which account it was account at the 

bank. He had 

the duty of the prisoner to pay all sums not necessary for also authority, 
the current expenses of the concern ; and upon which i^ hand waT 
account the prisoner was authorized to draw when the cash jjlj^&apos;jj^che^ues^ 
in hand was insufficient to meet those expenses. In doing and in doing 
this tiie prisoner, with the sanction of his employers, did goner, with the 
not draw always in iuvour of a particular creditor tor the ^pWref did 
exact amount due to him, but drew in his own favour for &quot;o&apos; always 

draw m favour 

such a sum as he required, or was supposed to require, for of a particular 
his disbursements, and paid the creditors out of it. On exact amount^ 
one occasion he drew a cheque for 11/. lOf., which he dreV^„^hw^&quot;&apos; 

entered in the books of the firm as having been paid to the own favour for 
_, r^ such amount as 

Eastern Counties Railway Company for a debt due to he thought pro- 
them from the firm, but which cheque was, in fact, paid by S^^ion°the* 
the prisoner to his own landlord for rent due from himself, prwon*&quot;&quot; drew 

* a cheque for 

1H.10«., which 
he entered and took credit for as having been paid to a creditor of his employers, but which 
he, in fact, applied to his own pin&apos;poses : — Heid, that the prisoner, on this evidence, could 
not be convicted of forgery ; inasmuch as, having a general authoritv to draw cheques, he did 
not necessarily exceed his authority when he drew the cheque ; and that the criminal act, if 
any, was the subsequent appropriation of it 

The prisoner was also indicted for embezzlement ; the evidence being, in addition to that 
already given, that it was the prisoner&apos;s doty to make out weekly accounts of the payments 
made by him, by entering them in a book, and adding them up at the end of each week. 
On three several occasions within six months the prisoner entered the payments made by 
him correctly, but in adding up the items made the totals 2/. greater than they really were, 
and took credit with his employers for the larger amount. These were the cases on which 
the indictment was founded. At the trial evidence was tendered that on a series of occa- 
sions before and after those mentioned in the indictment, precisely similar errors had been 
made by the prisoner, and advantage taken of them by htm, and was objected to : — Hetd^ 
that to explain motives and intentions this jevidence was admissible. 




344 CASES ON TH£: 

It was for forging this cheque that the prisoner was now 
indicted ; whereupon 

Power, for the prisoner, objected that this was no forgery, 
as the prisoner had authority lo dinw cheques. 

Williams, J. — The cases come to the brink oftliis. In 
/?. V. Minter Hart (a), the prisoner had authority to fill 
up the bill to a certain amount, but, having filled it up to 
a larger amount, was held guilty of forgery. 

Power, — But in this case there is ^general authority to 
draw, limited only by the amount of the balance at the 
bank. 

Williams, J. — That is the difference. There was, no 
doubt, in this case a discretion vested in the prisoner to 
draw cheques, and so create a balance in his hands to 
meet the demands made upon the firm. The prisoner, 
therefore, did not necessarily exceed his authority in draw- 
ing for this amount, and the criminal act was rather the 
subsequent appropriation of it. 

The prisoner being accordingly acquitted upon this 
charge, was then put upon his trial for embezzlement. 

The indictment in this case contained three charges of 
embezzlement within six months, and, in opening the case 
for the prosecution, the evidence of embezzlement in these 
three cases was stated to be as follows: —That the prisoner, 
being in the position and conducting the business of Messrs. 
Harrison in the manner already described, it was his busi- 
ness to pay the labourers* wages, and make cerUiin other 
payments, and to make out weekly accounts of all such 
payments, by entering them in a book and adding them 
up at the end of each week. On the 23rd of March, I8G0, 
the prisoner&apos;s book showed a number of payments as 
having been made during the preceding week. All these 
payments had in fact been made and correctly entered, but 
the casting up, instead of showing a total of 20/. 12$. 8c/., 
{a) 7 C.&amp;P. 652. 



RlCUARDSOy. 



NORFOLK CIRCUIT. 345 

the real amount, showed a total of 22/. 12«. 8d., For which i860, 
sum the prisoner, in accounting with his master, took ^■^^&apos;**^ 
credit. In another week there was a precisely similar error «. 

of the same amount, for which the prisoner also took 
credit; and the same in a third week. These three cases 
were those on which the three charges of embezzlement 
contained in the indictment were founded. 

O^MalUy said that, anticipating that a defence would 
be set up that these errors were the result of accident, he 
should show a series of similar errors both before and after 
those which formed the subject of the present charges. 

Poiver, for the prisoner, objected that this evidence was 
inadmissible, and that it ought not to be opened. 

His Lordship said that, as at present advised, he thought 
it admissible; and, if necessary, the question could be dis- 
cussed when the evidence was tendered. 

Evidence having been given in support of the three 
charges, mainly in accordance with the above statement, 
it was then proposed by the prosecution to prove the series 
of erroneous castings as above. 

Power and Naylor, for the prisoner, argued that this 
could not be done. They contended that the general rule 
of law was, that the evidence must be confined to the point 
in issue; and the rule was founded on the principle that a 
man was not called upon to be prepared to explain any 
other transactions than those which were the subject of 
inquiry. This rule was always strictly applied in criminal 
cases, the only exceptions being those of a recognized 
kind, namely, on indictments for conspiracy, for uttering, 
or for receiving stolen goods. If this evidence were ad- 
missible in all cases those cases would not have been 
treated as exceptional, and the whole doctrine of election 
was based on the supposition that some such rule as that 
contended for exists. Similar evidence was very recently 
held inadmissible on an indictment for obtaining money by

dered for the same purpose as here^ namely, for the pur- 

». pose of showing what the intention of the prisoner really

was. 

Williams, J.— I am clearly of opinion that this evidence 
is admisfiible. There is no principle of law which prevents 
that being put in evidence which might otherwise be so, 
merely because it discloses other indictable offences; R. v. 
Clewesijb). Now it is clear that on this indictment the 
defence must be that these are mere erroi*s in the castings; 
and such defence naturally arising, any lawful means may 
be resorted to whereby such ddence may be anticipated, 
and proved to be ill-founded ; and evidence which is ad- 
missible for such a purpose is not the less so because it 
tends to prove the commission of other felonies by the 
prisoner. To hold that this evidence is admissible is in 
accordance with the principle laid down in numerous cases, 
that to explain motives or intention evidence is admissible, 
although it does not otherwise bear upon the issue to be 
tried. This principle was recognized in 22. v. Oddy{c\ 
before the Court of Criminal Appeal, and also in a case 
which excited a great deal of interest at the time, that of 
12. V. Geering, a report of which will be found in 18 L. J., 
M. C. 215. There the prisoner was being tried for the 
murder of her husband by means of arsenic, and evidence 
was tendered that two other members of the prisoner&apos;s 
family bad died by similar means, the object being to 
rebut the suggestion that the death which was the subject 
of inquiry was the result of an accident. The present 
Lord Chief Baron, with the concurrence of Aldbrson, B., 
and Talfourd, J., admitted the evidence. This appears 
to me to be a similar case, and I think the evidence is ad- 
missible. I may add that, anticipating that this point

at night but roosted on the lower branches of some adjoin-

returned to and remained with the hens during the day,

tame pheasants.

Pollock, C. B. (after consulting Williams, J.)— I am 
of opinion that these pheasants, as long as they are under 
the care and protection of the hen which hatched them, are 
to be considered the property of the owner of the hen. 
Being his property they are not game within the meaning 
of this statute, for that term necessarily implies something 
which is not the subject of property. The prisoner must, 
therefore, be acquitted on the first two counts. 

The prisoner was then convicted of a common assault.

The deceased had died in January, 1854, possessed of a 
farm in which he had a leasehold interest, and leaving 
upon it a large quantity of dung, in heaps, which, by the 
custom of the country, was to be consumed upon the 
land. 

A female named Radbourne had then entered on the 
farm under an alleged will, and was in possession of it as 
apparent owner. In the spring of 1864 she sowed the 
crops, and in the autumn of 1864 she reaped the crops, 
and there was a certain quantity of fresh straw, ice, then 
made. 

In November the defendant took the farm under her, 
without any agreement in writing, but under an arrange-

the amount of 62/., including several &quot; henps of dung&quot; (the 
dung then remaining on the farm), and also &apos;&apos; loading and 
spreading&quot; manure, and a &quot;quantity of manure made from 
Inst year&apos;s produce,&quot; about seven loads, in the yard. The 
defendant had paid the amount of this valuation to Miss 
Had bourne, and she afterwards had a sale on the pre* 
niises. 

The vdluer employed was called, and said he had valued 
it at 62/., which was the full value. He stated that the 
custom of the country was to value only the manure de- 
rived from the last year*s produce, as otherwise the land 
would be robbed ; that the only tenant-right which would 
come to the deceased would have been the wheat sown in 
November, and the manure,&amp;c., and that no benefit would 
come to the tenant coming in after Michaelmas, the whole 
of the crops having been reaped. The defendant had paid 
his rent to Miss Radbourne for two years. 

In I85G the will was set aside, and in 1857 the plainlifT 
took out letters of administration. This action was begun 
in August, 1869. There was at the first trial, before 
Pollock, C. B., no distinct evidence as to what quantity 
of dung remained on the farm when the defendant took it 
as tenant, and there was evidence for the plaintiff that 
there were 200 loads of manure on the farm when Jackson 
died, and about 150 loads when the defendant took it. 
The defendant was called to disprove this, and to prove 
his payments to Miss Radbourne, which were objected to 
but received. 

Hall, the valuer, was also called for the defendant, and 
gave the evidence above stated, and swore that there were 
only seven loads of new manure. 

Pollock, C, B., on the former trial, had held that the 
plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the first count, as

XrESPASS: for breaking and entering a piece of land 
on the west side of the river Lee, in the parish of Wal- 
thamstow. The venue was in Essex. 

Plea : not possessed, and soil and freehold in the de- 
fendant. 

The case for the plaintiff traced title down to his land- 
lord by deeds, describing the land as part of the soil of the 
river, which bounds Essex and Middlesex, and overruns 
the land at times, which is low and swampy. 

The evidence for the plaintiff also showed, by parish 
perambulations, that the land was in Walthamstow. 

And witnesses for the plaintiff stated as matter of repute 
that it was always deemed to be in Essex. 

There was a good deal of ambiguity raised by cross- 
examination, as to whether the whole of the river formed 
the boundary, or the middle of it, or what was the original 
bed of the river. 

Zti5/i, for the defendant, objected that there was no 
evidence of the venue ; but 

WiGHTMAN, J., ruled that there was evidence* 

Lush then went into evidence in support of a case 
founded on an enclosure act, which authorized an allot- 
ment of lands in the parish of Edmonton, in the county of 
Middlesex, and produced old maps to prove that the locus 
in quo was in that parish and county. But some of the 
witnesses for the defendant admitted tliat the place was in 
Essex. 

The defendant was called j and stated that the plaintiff had

cut the grass for thirty years past, until June, and that then 1861. 
he^ the defendant, grazed it until the wet season begun. 

WiGHTMAN, J. (to thejury.) — It is for you what the 
evidence really comes to as to the boundary; and whether^ 
if the river was the boundary, what was the boundary. Is 
the place in the county of Essex ? Is it the land of the 
plaintiff? The defendant&apos;s own evidence show that he cut 
the crops, and the defendant&apos;s own case is quite consistent 
with the plaintiff&apos;s, for the land might be in the plaintifFs 
possession and be his landlord&apos;s, and yet the defendant 
might be entitled to a right of grazing on it. 

1. Is the land in Essex ? 2. Has it been in the posses- 
sion of the plaintiff? 3. Is it the land of the defendant&apos;s 
landlord ?

HOME CIRCUIT. 357 

February, 1864, admitted tenant on Deeuier&apos;s surrender, 1861. 
and assigned to the prosecutors by way of mortgage for ^&quot;^^^ 
tliose advances. There was evidence that G. Vile knew v. 

that the cottage required repair when he took the sur- 
render, but that he allowed it to remain out of repair until 
20th March, 1856, on which day the lord seized the pre- 
mises as forfeited for waste ; a notice of the seizure being 
fixed on the cottage directed to him. 

Vile wrote to the bailiff excusing his neglect, and stating 
his intention to repair. Some time afterwards he pulled 
down the premises, and commenced building other cottages 
now on the land. 

The bailiff gave him notice not to build on the land, the 
premises having been forfeited. But the cottages were 
completed through advances made by the society, without 
notice of the forfeiture, and secured by a new deed of 
assignment dated 27th December, 1855. There was evi- 
dence that the cottages, as rebuilt, were better than those 
which were there before. On the other hand, it was ad- 
mitted that the original buildings were out of repair as 
above stated. 

The prosecutors had applied to be admitted, but the de- 
fendant Dare claimed the premises as forfeited. 

There was a great deal of evidence as to whether, when 
Vile took the premises, the cottages were repairable, or 
in such a state that they could not reasonably be repaired, 
and were uninhabitable. 

Lush contended that the prosecutors had no estate or 
interest, and were not damnified ; but 

WiGiiTMAN, J. — That is not material here. The question 
of fact is, whether the lord had a right to seize? 

At the close of the evidence, 

VViGHTMAN, J. (to the jury).— The questions for you are, 
1. When Vile was admitted were the premises in such a 
ruinous sttite that they could not be repaired? — (Yes.)

The plaintiffs were trustees of a society to which Randall

letter, in the usual form, to the defendant, telling him that 
he had been proposed as surety, with Payne and Bennett, 
and desiring to know if he consented, and if so, that he

would furnish the names of two referees, as to bis respon- 1861. 
sibility. The defendant, in answer, consented, and gave ^&apos;^^ 
the names of bis referees. On inquiry, it appearing that and Another 
Payne was hardly sufficiently responsible, the name of gibbons. 
Nixey was proposed to and accepted by the society, in ad- 
dition to the other sureties. The transaction was arranged 
at Slough, where Nixey lived, by one Crook, the agent of 
the society there. The loan not being repaid, and the 
sureties being resorted to, Nixey denied that he had exe- 
cuted the deed, or authorized its execution on his behalf, 
and it was clear that the actual signattare was not his. The 
deed was executed by Randall on the 25th November, 
1859, in London. 

Crook was called for the plaintiffs and produced a docu- 
ment dated the 24th November, on one side of which was 
a memorandum of indemnity by Payne and the defendant 
to Nixey if he executed the deed, and on the other side 
was the following : — ^&apos;&apos; In consideration of Gibbons and 
Payne&apos;s indemnity, I agree to the proposal, and you may 
sign for me. — ^T. Nixby.&quot; Crook swore that this was 
signed by Nixey, and that, acting thereon, he affixed his 
name to the deed. 

Chambers objected that the authority ought to have been 
by deed ; but 

EuLfi, C. J., held the document admissible, as it might 
be material for another purpose. 

The defendant was called and swore that he had not 
signed the indemnity (which did not purport to bear his 
signature), nor had seen tlie document on the occasion 
alluded to; that he was told that Nixey would sign the 
deed, and that he would not himself have signed had he 
not believed that Nixey had done so, and that he did not 
know until some time afterwards that Nixey had not 
signed. He admitted, however, that he had not required 



360 CASES ON THE 

18G1. that Nixey should join, but that he only Isud heard that 
^ &quot;^&quot;^ the society had required it. 
and Another ^^^^^ q j ^^^ ^|,g j„ry)._It may bc taken that the 
Gibbons. deed was executed. 

Then as to the equitable plea. It slates au agreement 
with the derendant that Nixey should Bign the deed as co- 
surety with him; that the society should procure him to 
execute it, and that if they should not do so the defendant 
should not be liable. Has such an agreement been proved ? 
The lender is usually the party who requires an additional 
surety, and so it seems to have been here. Still it may 
be sometimes for the interest of a surety to say, ** unless 
you get co-sureties to join with me (a), I will not become 
surety.&quot; 

And that is the defence set up here. Has it been 
proved ? The evidence is very slight of any such agree- 
ment with the defendant. The defendant himself docs not 
say that he required that Nixey should join, but merely 
that he know that the society had required it. Did the 
defendant require it for his own benefit or security, or was 
there any agreement or understanding on his part, as a 
condition of his own execution, that Nixey should join? 
Does it appear that the defendant, before he signed, looked 
to Nixey at all? On the contrary, he says he did not 
know until some time afterwards that Nixey had not signed. 
As to Crook&apos;s signing for Nixey, it was a mere error, and 
in law there was no authority to do so. But the defendant 
could hardly have signed on the faith that Nixey would 
sign.

In June, 1860, the prosecutrix, one Mary Huntley, made 
an information ngninst the prisoner that she was the 
mother of a bastard child by him. She stated that she 
went into the service of his father in April, 1858, left in 
May, 1859, and was delivered in July, 1859, the prisoner 
havinor been at his father&apos;s while she was there. Her evi- 
dence in chief was: — &quot;The defendant came into my bed- 
room, and on three occasions I had been in my bed,&amp;c. ; 
on the second occasion, T. J. came in, and I scratched the 
defendant&apos;s face, he was then trying to kiss me, and had 
his hand about my waist. 1 had not been at his father&apos;s 
above a month when he began to take liberties with me.&quot; 

The defendant was called by his attorney in answer to 
the charge, and being examined gave evidence, which was 
read by a witness, who had taken it down in the affirma- 
tive form in the usual way : — &apos;&apos; I never had any connection

Robinson objected, that the evidence was not material, 
as it was far too wide in the form in which it was given ; 
it could not be material whether the prisoner ever kissed 
the girl-*for instance, while she was a child. 

Barrow proposed to show the questions put by the de- 
fendant&apos;s own attorney, which might make the answers 
material (a), and 

WionTMAN, J., assented to that course. 

Barrow then recalled the witness, who produced tlie 
minutes of the defendant&apos;s evidence, but he could not re- 
collect the form of the questions. 

Robinson then pressed his objection, and 

WiGHTMAN, J., retired to consult Erle, C, J. ; and on 
his return, declined to stop the case. 
At the close of the case, 

WioHTMAN, J. (to the jury). — There cannot be a con 
viction for perjury unless the falsehood of the testimony is 
proved in substance by two witnesses. As to a great 
part of the defendant&apos;s evidence, of course this would be 
from the nature of the case impossible. And then the ques* 
tion arises, whether the parts of his evidence which are 
assigned as perjury were material to the investigation. It 
seems to me that they were so, but that is for you. Were 
they material and wilfully false?

Covenant by tlie seven, that they bad full power to as- 
sign, but oiilyjice had executed. 

In March, 1860, one T. took possession of the premises, 
and a quarter&apos;s rent was received from him; when more 
rent became due, the pIuintifTs had letters from the defend- 
ant Moore, describing himself as &quot;tenant.&quot; But there was 
no evidence of payment of rent by Moore, and his letter 
was to the Electric and International Telegraph Company. 

Bovill objected to this, but 

VViGHTMAN, J., overruled the objection, as the amalga- 
mated company were to exercise the powers of the said 
company or &quot;either of them.&quot; 

Bovill then objected that the venue should have been 
in London, as the premises were there, and the action 
against the assignee was local. It did not appear on the 
declaration but in evidence, and the objection equally 
arises, for the deed being produced shows that the pre- 
mises are in London, and that does not support a declara- 
tion with the venue Surrey. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — ^The declaration does not allege that 
the premises are in Surrey, so the objection does not arise 
in evidence. Before the Common Law Procedure Acts 
you might have craved oyer of the deed, set it out and de- 
murred ; you could -not have raised the point at the trial. 
The Common Law Procedure Act has not altered the law 
in that respect (a). The objection is not available here. 

Bovill then put in an agreement, not under seal, by 
which two of the lessees on the 29th February, I860, pro- 



{a) Tlie defendant might have 
act out the deed as a plea, or

fessed to let the premises to the defendants for seven 
years, the defendants agreeing to take an assignment of 
the lease under which the parties professing to let held ; 
and in case the assent of the Electric Telegraph Company 
should be obtained, then, on the execution of that assign- 
ment, the lease hereby granted to be considered at an 
end. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — Not being under seal, it is void as a 
lease by the 8&amp;9 Vict. c. 108. It is a mere agreement. 

Bovill. — Nevertheless, as the defendants paid rent under 
this agreement, they were tenants under it from year to 
year, their interest only being liable to be determined on 
the due execution of the assignment by the eight lessees, 
which never was executed. Therefore, either the defend- 
ants are not assignees at all, or, isisjive only of the lessees as- 
signed, they are assignees only of five-eighths of the lessees* 
estate and interest, and in either view the first count fails. 

Lush, on the latter point, cited Heap v. Livingstone (a), 
to show that the defendant should have pleaded in abate* 
ment, or was estopped from raising the objection ; and as 
to the other point, 

WiGUTMAN J., said : — The company were no parties to 
this agreement. They claim by the assignment. Then 
there is the count for use and occupation, on which there 
is evidence. 

BovilL — As to that the defendant cannot be liable to 
the plaintiffs, being an underlessee. Moreover, there is a 
lease by deed (&amp;). 

WiGHTMAN, J. — But your case is, that the defendants 
did not hold under that lease. 

BovilL — There is no other agreement with the plains 
tiffs.

WioHTMAN, J. — There is evidence for the jury. Where 
the tenant is lessee by deed, use and occupation does not 
lie (a). 

Bovillihen proposed to call the defendant Moore, to 
show that he did not know that the assignment had not 
been executed by all the lessees. 

WioHTMAN, J.— But Ae executed it. 

Bovill. — Still he did not know that the lessees had not 
executed, and he executed on the faith of their doing so. 

The defendant Moore being called, said, he originally 
took the premises under the agreement which had been 
put in. . He had paid no rent, nor knew that T. had paid 
any. The assignment had been executed subsequently by 
five of the lessees, and he had never had any other in- 
terest in the premises save such as might arise under those 
two documents. At the time the letters were written he 
was not aware that the assignment had not been executed 
by all the lessees. At the time he executed the deed it 
was pointed out that two names were wanting, but it was 
said that they could join. He had not been party or 
privy to any payment of rent, nor had he occupied the 
premises in any way after May, 1860; and up to that 
time he had only been there as secretary ; after that time 
he believed T. had possession. He had written to T. as 
his co-tenant^ to pay the rent at Michaelmas. 

WiGHTMAN, J. — Occupation by a co-tenant is suflScient 
to sustain use and occupation (A). There must be a verdict

HOME CIRCUIT. 



369 



The plaintiff had been retained by the defendant at an 
annual salary as alleged. 

In June, 1859| the defendant wrote to the plaintiff: 
&apos;&apos; Our friends request us to curtail our expenditure during 
the time our works are in abeyance, and have particularly 
called attention to your salary, which they say, during the 
suspension, ought not to be charged, as there is nothing to 
call for your labours. We hope you understand this, and 
we hope shortly to recommence our works.&quot; 

The plaintiff subsequently gave this receipt : — &quot; Received 
from Messrs. Wanostrocht k Co. 60/. for a quarter&apos;s salary 
ending 30th June, 1859, being, for the present, the last, or 
until the works shall be resumed.&quot; 

The works had not been resumed; and the plaintiff, 
finding they were not to be, had in April, 1860, claimed 
** the usual notice.&quot; 

WiGHTMAN, J. (to the jury). — ^The contract is proved as 
laid. As to the second plea, there was nothing for the 
plaintiff to do. As to the third, there was not necessarily 
an absolute rescission of the contract, but only a temporary 
suspension. There should have been a plea of substituted 
agreement (a). It is said that the plaintiff was not to be 
paid unless the works were resumed. But it is plain that 
both parties hoped that they would be. Therefore the 
questions for you are these : — 

1. Was the contract rescinded as to any salary subse- 
quent to June, 1859, and absolutely put an end to? 

2. Was he retained after that only in case the works 
should be resumed ? 

3. Did the defendant in effect give notice to the plaintiff 
in June, 1859, to terminate the original contract, and did 
the plaintiff accept such notice?

The jury answered all these questions in the affirmative ; 
whereupon 

WiGHTMAN, J., directed a 

Verdict for the defendant (a). 



(a) Supposing the original agree- 
ment to have been put an end to, 
the question would be, whether 
there had been any substituted 
agreement to pay the plaintiff? 
which, in effect, the jury nega- 
tived; iMmburn v. Crudenf 2 M.&amp;Gr. 253. Then, supposing the 
first agreement to have been put an 
end to, it would be of course only a 



nice question of pleading, whether 
the defence did not arise under a 
plea of rescission ; for substitution 
is a rescission or a condition of sub- 
stitution, and here the substituted 
agreement was on a condition, viz., 
resumption of the works, which 
never in fact took effect ; so that, in 
the result, it really came to an ab- 
solute rescission.

\t, in the notice of action which had been given under the 
statute, as a public highway and as a private way. The 
action had not gone beyond the writ and notice, and the 
notice contained other grievances besides the obstruction 
of the highway, one of them being an interference with 
ancient lights. 

Keane, for the prosecutor, showed cause. The applica- 
tion is unprecedented, but we are willing to postpone the 
trial of the action until after the trial of the indictment 

Coleridge, for the defendant, in support of the summons. 
The object is that the defendant may give his evidence in 
the action, and both the parties, at the first trial of the 
question, be piit on an equality. 

Keane. — He does not swear that he intends to give evi- 
dence. There are other causes of complaint in the action. 

WiGHTMAN, J. (after consulting Hill, J.), was of opinion 
that a person ought not to be harassed with two proceed- 
ings, and when he is so, the Court have a right to deter- 
mine which of the two proceedings shall be pursued, so as 
to place the parties in a position of equality. Here, how- 
ever, being an allegation of a public nuisance, and the in- 
dictment founded only on that, it is only a public grievance 
by reason of a private wrong. Therefore, if the prosecutor 
would undertake not to proceed in the action — so much of 
it as related to the right of way--^no order should be 
made. 

Keane assented to this, and, therefore, 

No order.

Gibbons, contrct, urged that it would be most unreason- 
able and unjust to order a sale of property which, for any- 
thing that appeared, was not more than sufficient, even in 
real value, to satisfy the security ; and which, if sold at a 
forced sale, might not be half sufficient, so that there 
would be great loss to the claimant and no benefit to the 
judgment creditor. 

Bramwell, B. — No doubt the section in terms gives 
power to make the order, but it must be reasonably con- 
strued, and a just discretion must be exercised before the 
order is made (a). It seems to me that no sufficient 
grounds are here made out for the order, and that it ought 
not to be made except on special gounds. The claimant 
has a right to ** nurse his security,&quot; and I see no reason to 
interFere with that right. Therefore 

No order (6). 

(a) &quot;As Lord Coke says, with 
reference to the power given to the 
Commissioners of Sewers to act 
juxta diicreliones vttirat^ yet their 
proceedings ought to be limited and

(6) In equity, piiitne incumbran- 
cers, whether by mortgages subse- 
quent to the first, or creditors by 
subsequent judgments (which give 
a lien on real estate), are entitled 
to redeem if they can ; but, subject 
to that option, the first mortgagee 
may foreclose against them all; 
Stead V. Banks, 5 De Gex&amp;Sm. 
560; 22 L. J., Ch. 208 ; Ford v. 
Chesterfield, 16 Beav. 516; 22 
L. J., Ch. 630. And first mort- 
gagee has a right to a decree for 
sale or foreclosure, though a subse- 
quent incumbrancer desires to re- 
deem, if the value of the property 



does not appear ; Wick/iam v. Ni&quot; 
cholson, 19 Beav. 38. Under the 
15&amp;16 Vict. c. 86, s. 48, the 
Court of Chancery has power, by a 
provision somewhat similar to that 
in the C. L. P. Act, to direct a sale 
of mortgaged property ; but that 
power being substituted for that of 
foreclosure, is deemed subject to 
the same rules of principles ; Wayn 
V. Lewis, 22 L. J., Ch. 1051. On 
the same principle it should seem 
that the provision in the C. L. P. 
Act should not be arbitrarily ezer* 
cised, but by analogy to the rulet 
of equity, as it is a provision inter- 
fering with a clear legal tight ; and 
it is not to be presumed that tho 
legal title is to be controlled except, 
on equitable principles. Those 
principles appear to require that 
the applicant should show that the 
value of the goods is more thaa 
sufficient to cover the amount for 
which they are security, and th«t

the sale may be made without in- 
jury to the raUie of the security; 
for in equity a sale is never forced, 
and successive periods are always 
allowed to redeem. This appears, 
indeed, from the terms of the clause 
itself, which seems to have been 
carefully framed with reference to 
those principles of equity; for it 
provides that the Judge may order 
payment of the whole, or part, of 
the secured debt, which implies 
that it is made to appear that the 
value of the goods are mare than 
sufficient to satisfy the whole, or 
the Judge canuot have that option; 
and, though he may order payment 
only of a /Mr/, that may be deemed 
to be with reference to olher se- 
curities, Avhich may be held for the 
same debt. Even in bankruptcy, 
secured ereditors may realize their 
securities, and then prove for the&apos; 
residue. Ex parte Pen/old, 4 De 
Gex&amp;Sm. 282 ; and a mortgage 
of goods, or a lien, is recognized, 
supposing it not per u an act of 
bankruptcy, and possession taken 



before the bankruptcy; Ex parte 
Span&apos;ow, 2 De Gex, Mac.&amp;Gor. 
907; Ex parte Bell, 1 De Gex, 
577; 17L.J., Bank. 9. And even 
if the inof tgagee becomes bankrupt, 
a sub-mortgagee cannot have an 
order for sale without an enquiry 
as to amount, Ex parte Mackaif, 1 
M., D.&amp;n. 550. And if, as a 
sub-mortgage, the security proves 
deficient, the assignee has a priority 
for the sum he has advanced, Ex parte 
Berridge, 3 M , D.&amp;D. 464. The 
Bankrupt Act, s. 184, expressly 
reserves the rights of creditors with 
liens; and s. 141 gives the assig- 
nees only the same rights which the 
bankrupt would have, i. e., in law 
or equity. And as to the discretion 
of the Court to order a sale of se- 
curities, see Ef parte Smith, 1 V.&amp;B. 518; 2 G.&amp;J. 105. Hence it 
seems as creditor he cannot sustain 
this application for sale, except by 
offering to pay the debt ; or by 
showing that the value far exceeds 
the debt.

The learned Baron, in ignorance of the fact of the arrest 
on the 16th March, made the order asked for in tl)ese 
terms : — &quot; That Shcmwell, the garnishee, do forthwith pay 
to William Marples, the claimant, the sum of 30/. 5s, due 
from the said garnishee to the plaintifT in this action, in 
part payment of the sum of 67/. Is. Qd.^ the amount certi- 
fied by the Master to be due from the plaintiff to the said 
William Marples under the order of interpleader.&quot; 

On the 19th Shemwell took out a summons for his dis- 
charge out of custody, on the ground that he had paid 
his judgment debt to Marples. No af&amp;davit of this was 
produced, and in point of fact it had not been paid other- 
wise than by being struck off the larger debt of 67/. due 
from Hartley to Marples ; and an authority from Marples 
to the sheriff to release Shemwell was produced. 

Bramwell, B,, made the order in these terms: — &quot;That 
on payment of 1/. 6s-, the plaintiff&apos;s costs of execution, to 
the plaintiff or to the sheriff on his behalf, the defendant 
be discharged out of custody of the sheriff as to this action ; 
the sum of 30/. 5s., being the amount of debt and costs in 
this action, having been paid by the defendant as a gar- 
nishee to Marples the claimant.&quot; The learned Baron at 
the same time declined to rescind his former order, although 
he observed that he was not sure that he should have made 
it had he been aware at the time that Shemwell had been 
arrested at the suit of Hartley; for it was at all events an 
arguable question whether, under such circumstances, the 
debt was garnishable. It is open, however, to Hartley to 
raise that question distinctly by an application to rescind 
the orders (a).

384 CASES AT THE 

1861. The plaintiff was a wine merchant^ and the pipes were 

at the London Docks warehouses, in his naroey until June, 
I860, when one Molloy, clerk to the plaintiff, showed the 
derendant warrants, \ti Molloy&apos;s name, and told him that 
he had them to sell. The defendant did not then buy, and 
the warrants were handed back to the plaintiff, indorsed 
by Molloy. In November, the warrants being still in the 
possession of the plaintiff, the defendant proposed to 
Molloy to get them, and that he, the defendant, should 
purchase. On the 13th November Molloy got the war- 
rants from the plaintiff, giving him this receipt : — &quot; Re- 
ceived from Mr. Osborn five warrants for five pipes of 
wine, which I undertake to return by two on Wednesday, 
or the money agreed on for them, viz., 146/.&quot; The war- 
rants were then handed by Molloy to the defendant, but 
he neither got the money nor returned them to the plain- 
tiff. And on the 16th November the defendant received 
notice of an attachment, by virtue of an action against 
Molloy at the suit of one Hernaman, upon all goods which 
now have or which hereafter shall come into the hands or 
custody of the defendant. 

The oflScer of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Court, who proved this, 
stated that it was competent for the plaintiff, by &quot; bill of 
property,&quot; to assert his property in the goods, against the 
attachment, but that they would still be in the defendant&apos;s 
custody, and that the attachment did not prejudice the 
plaintiff&apos;s right. 

For the plaintiff, Molloy was called, and both of them 
swore that the plaintiff had demanded the goods from the 
defendant. 

For the defendant, Hernaman was called, and he and 
the defendant stated that on the 14th November the de- 
fendant had an advance of 40/. on a bill from Hernaman, 
and that he showed him the warrants, and that Molloy 
also had received from Hernaman money to the same 
amount on the bill. It appeared, however, that H^rnamaq 




SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 386 

made the advance and got the bill at half-past ten, and 1861. 
that before eleven he sued out attachment, the warrants 
having been just before shown to him. 

Ballantine, Serjt., submitted that Molloy had been en- 
trusted with the warrants, and held himself out as the 
owner, with the consent and sanction of the plaintiff; but 

Blackbubn, J., told the jury that the question was, 
who was the real owner of the goods. . It not being denied 
that the plaintiff had demanded them of the defendant, 
that would be strong evidence to show that he had not lost 
his property in them. The holding out is not material, as 
it does not appear that the defendant put faith in it, but 
there is evidence that he and Hernaman were m collusion.

E. JameSf Parry ^ Serjti and Needkam, for the plaintiff. 

Shee^ Serjt., and Watkin Williams for the defendants. 

It was opened for the plaintiff that the defendant Spur- 
gin was and had been for thirty years chairman of a society 
for diffusing the doctrines of Swedenborg, and that the 
other defendants also were members of a committee of 
the society, of which the plaintiff had been manager, under 
the following arrangements : — 

By the rules, the affairs of the society were to be con- 
ducted by a committee, consisting of twelve members, who 
should be elected at the annual general meeting, and they 
should elect a chairman, deputy chairman and secre- 
tary, and might appoint a salaried agent or manager. The 
property of the society should be vested in four trustees, 
who should be subject to the laws, rules and regulations of 
the society for the time being. 

On the 6th July, 1854, the committee for the time being 
came to a resolution *&apos; that the person to be appointed&quot; 
(manager) should have premises, rent and taxes free; 
that he should be allowed a per-centage on all books sold 
by him out of the society&apos;s stock, and also be allowed to 
carry on a retail business in other works for his own 
benefit. 

One Wilkinson, the secretary, communicated this to the 
plaintiff (who had applied for the appointment), writing to 
him at the same time, on the part of the committee, to this 
effect, that they would guarantee him 150/. tlie first year, 
but that afterwards they would not propose to do more 
than free him from rent and taxes and give him the com- 
mission. 

On the 13th July, 1864, the committee resolved that 
the plaintiff be elected the agent on the general terms 
mentioned in the above resolution, with such modifications 
as might be mutually agreed upon, and that he be re- 
quested to meet them to assist in selecting a house.

. On the 26th July, 1864, the plaintiff attended the com- 
inittee, when the resolutions above stated were read to him 
and assented to. 

Some of the defendants were on this committee. 
. In January, 1866, the plaintiff was put into possession 
of a house by the then committee, including some of the de- 
fendants, and he was allowed to put his own name on the 
shop, as bookseller, and to carry on business both for the 
society and for himself. This was the house in question ; 
and he so continued to carry on business there until the 
trespass complained of. 

In the same year, 1866, the plaintiff was re-appointed 
by a resolution of the then committee in these terms : — 
&quot; Another year&apos;s engagement was entered into, with a six 
months&apos; notice of separation on either side.&quot; 

In 1866 the appointment was renewed. 

In 1667 it was likewise renewed, in these terms: — 
&apos;^ That Mr. White be manager for the ensuing year, at a 
salary of 76/. a year, and six months&apos; notice of separation 
on either side&quot; 

In July, 1868, 1869 and 1860, his appointment was re- 
newed in similar terms. 

The plaintiff stated that during all this time he had 
occupied the ground floor as his shop and premises, and 
the upper part of the house as his dwelling, but the first 
floor was used as the meeting-room of the society. He 
sold books on his own account, and the defendants were 
among his customers. 

On the 2nd August, 1860, the committee gave the plain- 
tiff notice to leave, on account of his selling books of which 
they did not approve. 

On the 8th November, 1860, at a meeting of the com- 
mittee, at which the defendants were present, they gave the 
plaintiff a written dismissal, and also a written notice re- 
quiring him to give up possession of the premises, where- 
upon he retired and locked the door of the shop. Upon

On the 26th November the plaintiff got possession again,

They had written to him offering to allow him to remove

There was another action pending for the wrongful dis^

an unlawful taking of possession, and there had been a

house, the plaintiff iiad exclusive possession of part of it

defendants had any right or title in the house. 

Erlb, C. J. — ^There is no case to go to the jury. As to 
the trespass^ the plaintiff came into possession under the 
defendants, and they put him, being in their employment, 
into the premises, the possession of which remained in 
them, and in which he had no ri^ht except by virtue of 
the contract of employment. No doubt it was part of that 
contract that he should carry on his own business on the 
premises, and under that contract he may have rights, but

his possession of the house was theirs, and when they 
entered these rooms he had no more possessory right there, 
as against them, than any other servant. He had no estate 
or interest as against the society, or those who let him into 
possession. 

Then as to the goods, they were upon the premises, on 
which they had a right to enter, and there was no seizure 
or taking possession except by that entry. Nor was there 
any detention against the plaintiff, for the defendants 
offered to return them, and it was for the plaintiff to apply 
for them (a). On neither of the counts, therefore, is there 
any ground of action, and consequently there must be a

The plaintiff, the executor, called on the defendant in action for the 
December, I860, claiming a year&apos;s rent due at Midsummer landlord&apos;s 
in that year. The defendant denied that he owed it, and c&quot;c«&apos;°&quot;* 
said he had paid half^ year up to December, 1859, and 
had paid 32/. 10«. afterwards on account of the testator. 

Pearce called the defendant, who proved payment of 
the whole amount claimed ; part having been paid to the 
testator as rent, and the rest, in February and March, 
1859, advanced at his request, and on an understanding 
that it should go against the rent. The testator died on 
22nd June, 1859, largely indebted to the defendant. The 
defendant swore positively that the advances were against 
the rent, and produced his cancelled cheques given to tes- 
tator&apos;s partner, which were put in. 

Coleridge cross-examined to show that these advances 
were to the testator&apos;s ^rm, and on a different account from 
the rent. 

Pearce referred to one of the cheques put in, and which 
bore at the back an indorsement by the defendant, coin 
firming his statement that it was given as payment in ad- 
vance of the rent. 

Coleridge objected, that, though the cheque was in evi- 




392 CASfiS AT TH£ 

1861. dence, that did not make ihe defendant&apos;s own indorsement 
evidence as against the testator or his executor, it having 
been made when the testator was absent. 

Byles, J. — ^The cheque is in evidence, and in evidence 
for all purposes. How can I prevent the jury from seeing 
anything on it? What the indorsement amounts to is 
another question. It is a general rule as to all such in- 
struments, that if put in they are evidence altogether, and 
taken as read. What the cheque proves is payment, but it 
is impossible for me to exclude what is upon it. 

At the close of the defendant&apos;s case, 

Coleridge said he did not dispute that the payments had 
been made, but that they were made on account of the 
rent. 

Byles, J. — It is a question of appropriation. There is 
a technical difficulty ; for the plea is, that the payments 
were after the cause of action accrued, i. e., after the rent 
became due. If the demise were under seal the difficulty 
would be greater ; as it is, a parol contract may be varied 
by parol, and the rent made payable in advance. Or 
perhaps, to meet this difficulty, the plea is pleaded as an 
equitable defence. I will reserve the point, giving leave 
to amend^ in any way necessary to raise the defence. The 
question I shall leave to the jury is, whether the payments 
were appropriated, as the defendant has stated, to the ac- 
count of the rent. 

Coleridge went to the jury, contending that there had 
been no such appropriation, and that it was a case of 
cross-demand, on which the defendant must be content to 
recover out of the assets (a). 

(a) If the rent had become due set off, or whether he could plead 

after the death of the intestate, the payment, would have depended, in

A clerk to the plaintiff, an attorney, proved that the 
defendants executed the deed, and read it. 

Robinson cross-examined as to the transaction out of 
which the deed arose, and as to whether certain advances 
were really made. 

Byles, J. — ^The defendants having read it, and executed 
it, knowing its contents, surely, though you showed the 
transaction out of which it arose to have been fraudulent, 
yet in an action at law^ on the deedy that would not be 
available as a Ugcd defence. 

Robinson said he should prove representations made by 
the plaintiff to the defendants that the deed, which the 
defendants did not understand the effect of, would not 
bind them at all. 

BvLBs, J. — ^That no doubt would be fraud, if it goes to 
this extent, that the defendants did not really know what 
they were signing, or that the effect of what they signed 
was misrepresented, which would come to the same thing. 
But it would not be competent, upon this plea, to enter

Robinson having cross-examined as to the circumstances

Huddles ton then called the plaintiff. 

Robinson cross-examined as to tlie effect of the deed, 
which the witness admitted was to assign a certain fund 
belonging to the defendants as security for the money, as 
well as to covenant for its repayment. 

Btlbs, J. — ^That is not material, if the defendants un- 
derstood what they were executing. 

Robinson cross-examined as to certain representations 
to B. and to the defendants. 

Byles, J. — Is there any case since Green v. Gosden (a) 
upon the effect of this plea and in such an action? 

Finlason, amicus curia, cited Mason v. Diichboume (i), 
as cited in Feret v. Hill{c). 

Byles, J., having read the case, declared that he should 

rule in accordance with it ; that the plea of fraud, in an 

action on a specialty, was a kind of special plea of non est 

factum, and would let in evidence of fraud in regard to the 

actual execution of the deed, as its contents being misread 

or misrepresented ; but that no other defence, founded on 

the nature of the transaction out of which it arose, was 

admissible or available. 

Verdict for the plaintiff. 



(a) 3 M.&amp;G. 41. There it 
was held that a plea of fraud to a

that it was given for money lent in

which never existed. After that 
case it was held, in Moent v. Hey- 
worth, 10 M.&amp;W. 147, that, even 
in a case of timple contract, a col- 
lateral representation, to avoid it on 
the ground of fraud, must have 



been such as induced the party to 
enter into the contrdct. 

(b) 1 M.&amp;R. 460. On a plea

previous fraud.

The deed was entered into in the month of October,

The plaintiff had repeatedly, before then, made com- 
plaints to the father, the defendant, that his son wns a 
drinking, idle, worthless kind of fellow, whom he declared 
be would not keep. 

The plaintiff called on the defendant soon after his son 
had gone away, as he said, to Plymouth, to enter as a 
ship&apos;s carpenter; and when the father asked, &apos;^ Is he worth 
fetching back ?&quot; the plaintiff replied, &apos;&apos; No, he is not worth 
his keep ; let him have his fill.&quot; The father offered to go 
after him ; but the plaintiff said it would be no use, re- 
peating that the youth was not worth his feed. The son 
never returned.

months after the absenting. 

Both parties appeared to have expected that he would 
return. According to his master&apos;s evidence, the youth 
earned 24$. a week for his master, and his keep cost about 
half that sum. 

Btles, J. (to the jury). — You must, as a matter of law, 
find for the plaintiff. The plea of leave and licence is not 
sustained. The action is not, however, a dissolution of the 
contract of apprenticeship, which continues until efiluxion 
of time, in October next. The apprentice may come back 
to-morrow; and the master cannot, therefore, recover for 
mere absenting damages beyond the time of the action, as 
he may in the case of permanent injury ; Hodsoll v. StalU 
brass (a). The declaration itself, which states the plain- 
tiff&apos;s complainti is, that the apprentice absented himself 
&quot; thence hitherto.&quot; The plaintiff cannot recover damages 
up to the end of the term, but only for the period from 
the absenting to the bringing of the action. But if the 
plaintiff afterwards assented to the absence, you can give 
no damages from the time of such assent. And in any 
view you may consider what was the value of the ap- 
prentice&apos;s services, which migkt be the difference between 
his earnings and his keep. As to that, however, you must 
look to the whole of the evidence, and especially to what 
the plaintiff said before and soon after the absenting, and 
say what was the real value of such an apprentice as he 
described.

years from that date. 

From the nature of the business, gold was continually 
lying about. 

On the 12th November, 1860, the defendant gave the 
plaintiff a part of a gold watch-case to take to a person ; 
and the plaintiff, when he returned, said he had lost it. 
The defendant then charged him with stealing it, dismissed 
him, and made the other charges mentioned in the counts 
for slander. 

The plaintiff&apos;s father saw the defendant, and the charges 
were repeated to him ; the other charges were then for the 
first time mentioned to him by the defendant, though the 
instances alleged went back to the first year of the term.

V. Some of the charges of stealing were to the father; but 

on other occasions the defendant had mentioned them to 

third parties. 

The plaintiff was called, and denied the charges. 

Parry, Serjt, cross-examined him as to the specific in- 
stances of theft alleged in the counts on slander, and also 
as to the watch-case, which was not mentioned specifically 
in the slanders set out. 

At the close of the case for the plaintiff, 

Byles, J., stated there were Jive charges of theft in 
question, but not the watch-case. 

Parry, Serjt., called the defendant, and went into all 
the charges, including that as to the watch-case. 

Byles, J., suggested that there should be a plea to the 
whole declaration, setting up all six instances of theft, and 
such a plea was accordingly added ; though 

Skee, Serjt., objected, as it might tend to instigate and 
incite the defendant&apos;s witnesses to drive home a charge of 
felony, which they had not intended at the trial to persist 
in; but 

Byles, J., said that could not be fairly urged in this 
case, as it clearly appeared that the charge of stealing the 
watch-case had been made at the time (a). 

At the close of the case, the evidence as to all the 
charges resting on the testimony of the defendant or his

SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 



399 



the case, and the fact that they rest so much on the testi- 
mony of the defendant, great discredit will be cast on the 
others. 

If the plaintiff was in the habit of stealing, as the de- 
fendant alleges, the defendant would not be bound to have 
him in his shop to instruct him, as there was gold lying 
about, and constant opportunities of stealing. The case 
for the defendant is, that the plaintiff tras an habitual thief, 
and had been so for yeara. 

The statements to the father would be privileged ; not 
so as to third parties. 

On the count for not instructing and not paying the two 
weekly sums, the damages would not probably be severe ; 
but the real question of damage is on the counts for

CASES AT THE MIDDLESEX 



1861. 




Collier and Stephenson for the defendant. 

It appeared that the defendant had, for some time past, 
been the proprietor of an evening entertainment at the 
Prince of Wales&apos;s Hall, Regent Street, and for the purpose 
of the entertainment had hired pianos of the plaintiffs from 
time to time. The last hiring was of the two pianos in 
question, and took place on the 8th October, 1860. The 
defendant on that day agreed for the hire with one of the 
plaintiffs ; the rate being three guineas per month, and paid 
the first month&apos;s hire in advance. The pianos were sent 
to the Prince of Wales&apos;s Hall on the same day, and on 
their arrival the defendant signed the following paper : — 

&quot; London, Oct. 8, I860, 
&quot;Nos. 331,379. 

&quot; Received on hire from Messrs. Leader&amp;Cock, of 63, 
New Bond Street, two piano-fortes at thfee guineas per 
month, exclusive of carriage, which will be charged to and 
from ; and I undertake to deliver the same wlienever they 
may demand it, or to their order only. 

&quot;(Signed) C. Hortor Rhys. 
&quot; Witness, J. Duffin.&quot; 

This paper, with the exception of the names,&amp;c., was 
printed, and was contained in a book consisting of forms 
of similar documents, which it was the plaintiffs&apos; practice to 
get signed by their customers when pianos were hired. 

About the latter end of November the plaintiffs applied 
to the defendant to return the pianos, but he objected to do 
so ; and on the 7th December they wrote to defendant, 
informing him that they should send for them on the fol- 
lowing day, which they did. The defendant, however, 
refused to deliver up the pianos, alleging that he had hired 
them for three months. Upon this the present action was 
brought; the writ being issued on the 10th December. On 
the Ist January the defendant returned the pianos, stating 
that the three months had then expired (the defendant, as 
was supposed, reckoning the time as lunar months, but plain* 



SITTINGS— COMMCK t&gt;LEAS. 401 

tiffs reckoning it as calendar). The 6/. 10s. 6d. claimed In 18GI. 

the particulars included the hire to 8th December, and leader 

also the balance of a former account. ^^^ Another 

One of the plaintiff&apos;s was examined, and deposed that Rhys. 
nothing was said at the time of hiring as to its being for 
three months, or for any other definite term. 

Byles, J., intimated that the question appeared to be 
purely one of damages, the pianos having been given up, 
and that (he amount could only be nominal; viz., for the 
interval between the 8th December, the date of the writ, 
and (he 10th, when they were given up. 

Collier asked for a nonsuit; submitting that the hiring, 
if not for three months certain, was from month to month; 
that the payment of the first month&apos;s hire in advance made 
it so, and that the hiring could not be put an end to in the 
middle of a month, wliich he contended the plaintiffs had 
endeavoured to do. 

Parry, Serjt., and Z. Kelly argued, Ist, that the written 
undertaking must he taken as decisive of the terms of the 
hiring; that it clearly gave plaintiffs an unfettered power 
of putting an end to the contract at any time, at all events, 
at any time after the expiration of the first month ; that 
the case was analogous to that of contracts between master 
and servant, in which a power to determine the service 
might be exerci&apos;^ed in any part of the year (a); that by the 
usage of the piano trade (if evidence thereof were admis- 
sible), contracts of hiring were determinable at any time : 
that the defendant, by claiming to hold the goods for a 
longer term than they were hired for, entitled the plain- 
tiffs to determine the bailment instanter; and that the 
pianos had actually been sent for at the expiration of the 
second month.

402 CASES AT THE 

1861. 2ndly. As to the damages. The plaintiffs are entitled 

^^&apos;^&gt;^^^ not only to damages for the two days* detention between 
and Another the 8th and 10th December, but also for the subsequent 
RuYs. detention until the goods were given up. This case does 
not come within the ordinary rule which limits damages to 
matters arising before the commencement of the action. 
The action of detinue is substantially for the recovery of 
the goods themselves, and contemplates a detention con- 
tinuing subsequently to the writ, the plea being in the 
present tense non detinet; and the damages are merely 
accessory. The damages in detinue for goods are similar 
in their nature to interest for the detention of a debt, which 
is always allowed to be recovered down to the time of 
trial (fl). The case of Williams v. Archer^ in error (J), shows 
that it is the practice in assessing damages in detinue to 
take into consideration matters which have occurred pend- 
ing the action (c). It is believed that it is the practice in 
detinue to give damages down to the time of trial ; at all 
events, there is no established practice the other way, and 
it would be much more convenient that the whole damages 
should be recovered in one action, so as to avoid the ne- 
cessity of bringing another. No i ns tance of any such second 
action, however, has been found, which is strong evidence 
that the practice has been to recover all in one action, and 
that the plaintiffs have no further remedy. 

Collier replied, and did not call any witness. 

Byles, J. — Evidence of usage is not admissible ; but I 
am of opinion that, upon the terms of this undertaking, the 
plaintiffs had the power of claiming back the pianos at any 
time, whether in the middle of a month or not. As to the 
damages, the plaintiffs cannot recover for the detention 
subsequent to the date of the writ. Therefore the jury

worth more than 25^. a week, including that which was 
allowed him as his own earnings. That he went away on 
the 30th June, 1858, and had not returned; and that the 
plaintiff had inquired For him at his parent&apos;s without success. 
The action was brought in August, 1868 (a). 

Price, for the defendant, called no witnesses. 

Pollock, C. B. (to the jury). — This is an action very 
rarely brought, though no doubt it strictly lies. The plain- 
tiff cannot recover except for the absence from 1st June 
to August, and for that short period the jury may consider 
what was the real value of the boy, and may give nominal 
damages. No doubt there is no defence ; but the damages 
are for you. 

Verdict for the plaintiff, damages one farthing. 

Price applied to his Lordship to certify, under the Com- 
*mon Law Procedure Act of 1860(6), to deprive the plaintiff 
of costs, as the action was in substance one of tort; but 

Pollock, C. B., refused, saying it is strictly in contract. 



(a) It stood for trial at Michael- 
mas Term, 1858, but had been 
delayed by a commission on the 
part of the defendant to examine 
one son in India, whither he had 
gone with a regiment in which he 
had enlisted, and the commission 
had been enlarged until the son had 
returned to England. 

(6) When the plaintiff in any 
action for an alleged wrong re- 
covers hy the verdict of a jury lest 
than five pounds, he shall not be 
entitled to recover from the defend- 
ant any costs whatever in respect 
of such verdict ... &quot;can the Judge 
• . . shall mmediotelif afterwards 
certify • . , that the action was not 



really brought to try a right beside 
the mere right to recover damages; 
and that the trespass or grievance 
in respect of which the action was 
brought was not wilful or mali- 
cious ; and that the action was not 
fit to be brought.&quot; It has been 
thought that these words are not 
capable of a judicial construction, 
but the above case affords an apt 
illustration of their meaning, viz., 
that the action is for an alleged 
wrong, which turns out to be mere 
legal and technical wrong without 
any substantial damage, nor any 
intentional injury, nor any necei- 
sity to try a right. As to the words

thrown on their constmction by 
s. 74 of the C. L. P. Act, 1852, 
&quot; whereas certain causes of action 
may be considered to partake of the 
character both of breaches of con- 
tract and of wrongs,&quot;&amp;c. That 
clause refers no doubt to actions for 
breach of general duty as against 
carriers or bailees (see cases cited 
in Coitrtnay v. LV/c, 10 C. B. 73). 
And lience it seems to follow, that 
the &quot;alleged wrong,&quot; in the clause of 
the Act of 1860, may mean a breach 
of duty, and not mtreljf as in the 
3&amp;4 Will. 4, c. 42, s. 2, as to 
executors a &quot; wrong commitUdf&apos; 
which means a tortious ar/, for 
which reason probably the above 



clause does i:ot any &quot;action for 
any tortious act&quot; And there may 
be acts, as commissive waste, by a 
tenant, for which the defendant 
would be liable in case, notwith- 
standing a contract, even by deed 
(Burnett v. Lynch, 5 B.&amp;C. 589); 
so of an action for seducing away 
an apprentice or other sen&apos;ant (see 
Lumley V. Gi/e, 23 L. J., Q. B. 
463\ Rut in an action like the 
present, merely for the act of an- 
other person for whom the defend- 
ant has become rcspontible, which 
can only be by contract, of course 
the action is in no sense for wrong, 
i. e. for a wrong of the defendant.

was delivered and retained by the plaintiff. It was un- 
stamped. At the first trial, before Pollock, C. B., this 
was objected ; but it was held that the agreement was 
within the exemption &apos;&apos; relating to the sale of goods&quot; (a).

if appeared, that on the 6th October, the plaintiff, an auc- 1861. 
tioneer, wrote to the defendant — 

&quot; If you should tiiink 6t to entrust me with the manage- 
ment of the sale,&amp;e.,&amp;c., and if, pending the preparation 
for it, 300/. will be of any use, you can have it.&quot; 

On the 14th October the plaintiff wrote to the defend- 
ant&apos;s agent: — &apos;&apos; Mr. Bull wanted an advance of 160/. I 
shall have plenty of funds in a week ; meantime I can get 
him an advance from a friend by my drawing on him.&quot; 

Afterwards the plaintiff wrote :— &quot; I have seen my friend, 
and can have»an advance of 160/. till the house is sold, 
in one, two or three months,&quot;&amp;c. 

On the 18th October the defendant had written to the 
plaintiff thus : — &quot; I have just seen another party, and.can 
have an immediate advance of 150/., or even more, until 
such time as the sale comes off, that is, one, two or three 
months.*&apos; 

And one Dixon made the advance accordingly. 

And on these letters the Chief Baron had directed a 
nonsuit, which was set aside. 

A letter from Dixon, of the 24th December, ran thus :— 
&quot; When you called upon me with Mr. Topping, and I made 
the advance, it was upon the clear understanding that the 
sale should not be postponed for more than a month or six 
weeks.** 

Dixon was called for the plaintiff, and stated that this 
was the utmost delay that was to have been allowed. 

The plaintiff obtained an advance of 150/. for the de- 
fendant from one Dixon, the defendant giving a bill for the 
amount, payable on demand. 

In consequence of a delay in the sale for two months, 
Dixon wrote to the plaintiff; and, not having received pay- 
ment, caused the bill to be presented in January, when it 
was paid by the defendant. 

In the ensuing spring the plaintiff discovered that the 
conduct of the sale had b^ep entrusted to other auctioneers, 



410 CASES AT THE 

1861. and claimed his commission of five per cent, on the sum of 
ToppiKo 3,280/., the amount realized, viz. 164/. But it appeared 
V. that half the property sold was not included in the agrree- 

ment and now sued upon, and that the preparations for sale 
would have occupied the plaintiff a month ; the value of 
his time being estimated by him at 3/« 35. a day, which 
would come to 72/. 

The case for the defendant was, that he required the 
loan until the sale, when it could be paid out of the pro- 
ceeds, but that Dixon would not wait; and that the de- 
fendant had to obtain the money from the auctioneers who 
were employed, and who had stipulated that they should 
have the sale. 

At a former trial before Pollock, C. B., it was con- 
tended that, by the construction of the letters, the con- 
tract was as contended by the defendant ; and his Lord- 
ship being of that opinion, directed a nonsuit, which had 
been set aside ; and now 

Bramwbll, B., directed the jury that there was a com- 
plete contract in the letter of the 21st October, on which 
there appeared to have been a cause of action by the non- 
employment of the plaintiff; directing them, as to damage, 
that the value of time he would have been engaged should 
be deducted.

It appeared that in an action of ejectment by the now

which the writ of habere^ mentioned in the fifth plea, had 
been issued; the execution of which, the judgment and 
execution having been set aside as irregular (^r), was the 
trespass complained of. 

WiLDB, B. — The writ would be a defence as to those 
who executed it, but Green alone pleads it; and it does not 
appear that any of the defendants acted in aid of the 
bailiffs, or that any one of the defendants was a bailiff 
employed to execute the writ, or that the writ was de- 
livered by the sherifiTs to bailiffs at all ; but rather that the 
attorney took upon himself to execute it, and the defend- 
ants helped him ; and as the writ has been set aside as 
irregular, it only justifies the sheriffs&apos; officers (&amp;). 

Parry J Serjt., proposed to rely on the third and fourth 
pleas; but

Pearce objected that this case would not be admissible

Wilde, B., after consulting Martik, B., held that it 
was admissible under the plea of not possessed (a), if not 
either of the other pleas. 

Parry, Serjl., then proceeded to proof of the title on 
which the now defendant had recovered a verdict in the 
action of ejectment, and a difficulty arising as to the pro- 
duction of certain leases, 

Wilde, B., adjourned the trial for the purpose of pro- 
curing them(&amp;), on the terms of the defendants paying all 
the costs occasioned by the adjournment. 

At the adjournment day, the proof of the possessory 
title in defendant being completed, it appearing that he 
was executor of the termor, who had devised it to Calvert. 
That he had let the house in 1840, but from that time till 
1868 had not looked after it, having been away. That in 
1858 he had distrained on Bikker, then in possession, but 
had been sued in trespass for so doing, and failed. But in 
the action of ejectment he could not deny that there had 
been an arrangement to give up possession to Calvert as 
the party really entitled ; and he swore that he hud acted 
under the authority of Calvert. 

Pearce objected that there was evidence of an assent to 
the bequest to Calvert.

Pearce. — There is no evidence that he or Calvert were 
possessed; on the contrary, it appears that they vrer^not. 

WiLDB, B. — There is the second plea, which raises the 
question whether the plaintiff was lawfully possessed. (To 
the jury.) — The title is proved to be in defendant or in 
Calverty and that as against them the plaintiflT had no 
right to the possession. The defendant, therefore, could re- 
cover in ejectment, and would be justified in entering, 
without any unlawful violence (a). As between these 
parties— defendant swearing that he acted under Calvert — 
the question is, whether the plaintiff was lawfully pos- 
sessed as against them or either of them ? That is, whether 
plaintiff is the real owner, or entitled to possession ?

When the plaintiff went again to the vessel, a few days 18C0. 
afterwards, he found other persons in the cabin i he saw 
the defendant, who said he was sorry that he did not know 
the plaintiff had paid his deposit; that the other persons 
had engaged the cabin before him, but that he should have 
another better, as they were going to put up a ftrst-ciass 
cabin between decks, of which he should have the whole, 
and which would be raore roon^y and airy. The space for 
this cabin was shown to hin\ and approved of, and he 
assented to the arrangement. When the cabin was built, 
however, he was told that it was not for him, but plaintiiF 
insisted that it was, put a card upon it, and sent furniture 
for it, which he had bought, but which was removed out 
of it. Subsequently he was offered a cabin elsewhere, 
which he was promised should have port-hole and &apos;^ dead- 
light,&quot; but which he said was close and dark, and on the 
29th November his attorney wrote to the defendant thus: 
— &quot; Understanding you refuse to allow Mr. Lloyd to occupy % 
the cabin you agreed he should occupy, in lieu of the berth 
originally engaged by him, we give you notice that, unless 
we hear that he has been permitted to occupy that berth 
or the one substituted for it, he will not proceed in the 
ship, and will hold you liable.&quot; 

The ship remained some ten days longer at the docks, 
and it did not appear that the defendant had offered to the 
plaintiff any other cabin than that which he had rejected. 

He declined to proceed in the ship and had to wait for 
another for ten months, losing his deposit (20/.)i ^^^ 
various expenses incurred, and sustaining great inconve- 
nience.

The steam-boat had* been ordered to be built for river 
navigation in Russia. At the time of the insurance the 
insurers had a knowledge of its destination. It was proved 
that the vessel was well built, according to the specifica- 
tion, the dimensions from which were, with the assent of

the underwriter, inserted in the policy. It was admitted 
that a vessel with such dimensions would not be fitted for 
ocean navigation, and that therefore it was intended to 
take it to Odessa in fair weather. 

Upon the part of the plaintiff, however, ship-builders 
and others were called to prove that it would have been 
easy to make the vessel seaworthy for the voyage^ by cer- 
tain temporary strengthenings, which in some degree, but 
not in a sufficient degree, had been applied before it left 
the Tyne ; that some parts of the vessel, as the bulk-heads, 
were thin, and required such strengthening to make such 
a voyage safe. 

The evidence as to the voyage was, that after leaving 
the Tyne in July, the weather being rather rougher than 
usual, the vessel suffered considerably between that port 
and Dartmouth, where it was obliged to put in ; that at 
Plymouth, where she was again compelled to put in, the 
crew deserted, in consequence of their belief that she was 
unseaworthy; that she was again obliged to put in at Fal- 
mouth, where it was found that her plates and bulk-heads 
had been torn away, and that she had &quot; buckled,&quot; and 
there some further strengthenings were applied. But still 
she suffered greatly, and reached Odessa in a very damaged 
state. 

On the part of the defendants evidence was given to 
show that the requisite strengthenings had been applied at 
the Tyne, and that the damage had been caused by un* 
usually rough weather.

whether the vessel was seaworthy /or the voyage? If not,

The question was, whether the bill had been duly de-

The debt was duly entered, for which it had been ori- 
ginally given, and then the bill was thus described — the 
schedule having been filed in the month of Aprils but 
amended on the 11th May: — 

&apos;&apos;Bill for £45; dated about November^ 1868; drawn by 
Standish O&apos;Grady, of,&amp;c.| accepted by me and indorsed to 
Worman.&quot; 

The defendant was called, and said that Worman had 
discounted the bill for him, and that ho had not received 
notice of dishonour and knew nothing of the plaintiff 
being holder; but that, on the 4th May&gt;he received from 
Worman a letter to this effect : — &quot; I have received notice 
from a large firm in the city of the dishonour of your bill,&amp;c./&apos; the terms of the letter being such as to make it a 
good notice of dishonour, supposing it given by or on 
behalf of the holder. 

For the plaintiff, a clerk of his was called, who proved 
presentation of the bill to the acceptor on the 3rd May, 
and transmission of notice of dishonour to the defendant on 
the next day — the very day, it will be observed, on which 
Worman&apos;s letter was dated. 

Worman was called, and gave evidence which would 
have been amply sufficient to fix defendant with knowledge 
that the plaintiff was the holder ; but, being cross-examined

420 CASES AT THH: 

18G0. C. Pollock for the defendant. 

On the 2nd September, 1858, the plaintiff and defendant 
entered into an agreement, by which the defendant agreed 
that, after the plaintiff should have built twenty-two houses 
as specified, he would lease to him the land, and for a term 
of years from September 29, 1867, at a rent of 4Z. for each 
house, and the plaintiff agreed that he would build the 
houses on the land to the satisfaction of the surveyor, and 
that he would cover in four of the houses on the 25th 
December next (1858), and finish the same, fit for occupa- 
tion, on or before the 30th April next (1859), and cover in 
nine others on or before the 24th of June, 1859, and finish 
the same, fit for occupation, on or before the 25th De- 
cember, 1859, and cover in the remaining houses on or 
before the 25th March, 1860; the whole of the houses, 
with fences, roads and drains necessary thereto, to be 
finished fit for occupation on the 29th September, I860. 
The plaintiff to pay to the defendant such fair and propor- 
tionate sum as should be determined upon by the surveyor 
for constructing such principal or other drain along the 
whole frontage as should be directed by the defendant, and 
make a proper drain from each house communicating 
therewith. The plaintiff to have separate leases of the 
messuages so soon as, but not before, all of them should 
have been covered in, and the road and paving completed, 
and certified by the surveyor at a ground-rent of 4Z. per 
annum. And it was further agreed that, in default by the 
plaintiff before any lease was granted, or on nonpayment 
of the said rent or any part thereof for twenty-one days 
after becoming payable, or non-performance or non-observ- 
ance of any of the stipulations aforesaid, then, as to any 
part of the ground which may not have been so demised in 
the meantime, it shall be lawful for the lessor to enter and 
take possession thereof; and this agreement, as to such 
part of the ground, shall thenceforth be voidable by the 
lessor, and all improvements, materials, chattels and effects 



Stevens 



SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 42 1 

on the ground shall be absolutely forfeited to him or them. i860. 
And it was provided that time should be of the essence of 
the contract; that the agreement should not be construed v, 

to operate as a demise ; and that^ should the plaintiff not 
proceed regularly with the building to the satisfaction of 
the lessor, then it should become void| and the defendant 
be at liberty to re-let the land. There was a memorandum 
at the foot : — &quot;This agreement is subject to another agree- 
ment dated the 3rd September, 1858, and it is understood 
that this shall be a notice that this agreement is charged 
to the said T. J. Tayloj.&quot; The agreement of the 3rd Sep- 
tember thus referred to was one by which any monies 
which might be advanced by the defendant to the plaintiff 
for building the houses should be a charge upon the 
premises, and it was added at the end, &quot; this agreement is - 
made to secure such money as may hereafter be due to the 
said T. J. Taylor, but in no other way to affect the agree- 
ment of the 2nd September, 1868.&quot; 

The trespass was on the 15th August, 1859, and was 
an entry and seizure by the defendant under the agreement 
first mentioned. 

The plaintiff was called, and from his evidence, and that 
of one Green, it appeared that he had been delayed for 
some time waiting for plans,&amp;c., and that the defendant 
had not made the principal drain along th# whole frontage; 
in consequence of which, as the house-drains could not be 
opened into it, be had to keep two men at work to free 
the sites of the houses from the water. 

But it did not appear that he had applied for the plans 
or tendered the money for the principal drain. 

On the. 25th December, 1858, the four first houses were 
not, as they ought to have been according to the agree- 
ment, covered in. But in the first week of March they 
were so. 

On the 21st March, 1859, the defendant wrote to the 
plaintiff that he was not satisfied with the way in which 




422 CASES AT THE 

1860. the houses were being carried on. About this time the 
defendant said to the plaintiff, &quot; Don&apos;t go on with the other 
ninei finish these four first/&apos; those four having, it will be 
observed^ to be completed by the 30th April. There was 
a sum due for rent. 

On the 25th April, 1859, the defendant wrote to the 
plaintiff: &apos;^ I give you notice that I insist on payment of 
the rent due, and that, unless there is a great alteration in 
the course of a Week, and matters are put in a more satis- 
factory condition, I shall put the matter in my attorney&apos;s 
hands.&quot; On the 20th May the defendant wrote in similar 
terms. And, on the 31st June, the defendant&apos;s attorney 
wrote to him to the effect that the first four houses were to 
have been finished by the 30th April, and nine more to be 
covered in by the 24th of June, which had not yet been 
commenced ; that, therefore, the plaintiff had forfeited all 
right to any lease ; and that, unless security was given for 
the proceeding with the work, the defendant would avail 
himself of the forfeiture committed and take possession of 
the land. 

No such security was given, and no rent having been 
paid under the agreement, on the 16th August the de- 
fendant took possession of the land and some building ma- 
terials thereon, which was the trespass complained of. 

C Pollock contended that there was no case, as the 
plaintiff had no right of possession at the time of the de- 
fendant&apos;s entry« 

O. Francis contended that there had been no right of 
forfeiture, as the default of the plaintiff had been caused by 
the defendant, or had been waived.

Williams. In the lease to Couldery, the piece of land in question, 
about 4 feet 8 inches wide, was described as covered by 
a* shed; and there was a kind of lean-to, open at both 
ends, and leading both into a yard used in common by the 
occupiers of the houseS| and on to the premises of the de- 
fendant. 

The lease to the plaintiff demised all that was demised 
by the lease to Couldery. 

And the original lease to Shove demised all that was 
coloured &quot; red&quot; on the plan annexed, which included the 
piece in question. 

When the plaintiff&apos; took possession, the defendant had 
occupied his (the plaintift^&apos;s) present premises some years. 

In 1856 the freeholders mentioned above leased to the 
defendant two messuages, with the yards or gardens there- 
unto belonging, situate,&amp;c., with all ways and easements 
thereto belonging. 

The piece of land in question was at the rear of one of 
these houses ; the other being between it and the plai7iliff*s. 

The whole of the land at the rear of the premises was 
originally waste, up to and before the lease to Shove, who 
built the house of the plaintiff, and let part for a lecture

CoCKBURN, C. J. — ^The lease to the plaintiff was prior 
to the conveyance to defendant, and the lessors could not

Parry, Serjt., then proposed to prove a user of a right of

the plaintiff in 1853, nor any actual obstruction, until the 
present year. 

CocKBUHN, C. J. — ^There was unity of possession during 
a part of the time, and not twenty years&apos; adverse user. 

Parry, Serjt., offered to prove that when the plaintiff 
took the lease there was, across the piece of land where the 
plaintiff had erected the wall, a right of way through and 
over the piece of land in question. 

The defendant was called, and proved that he had occu- 
pied his house since 1840, and he and many witnesses, 
whose memory went back forty years, spoke to a ris;ht 
of way over the piece of land in question, which was now 
the only access to his stables; and some of them spoke to 
a gate existing long before and when the plaintiff took his 
lease. 

CoCRBURN, C. J., lefl the case to the jury on the ques-

the ship, as to when she would sail^ and the rate of freight. 
The plaintiff was told she would sail on or about the Ist 
September; and a card or ticket was put into his hands on 
which the rates of freight were marked, and in which the 
ship was, with others, described as &quot; F. Young&amp;Co.&apos;s 
Line.&quot; The plaintiff had no further communication with 
the defendants, but loaded his goods before the Ist Sep- 
tember, and sent bills of lading to Auckland. 

The ship having been mortgaged, the mortgagee did 
not allow her to sail ; and, in December, the goods were 
unloaded by the orders of the defendants, under his direc- 
tions, and re-shipped ; in consequence of which, they did 
not arrive until the autumn of 1868. 

The advertisement was as follows : —

&quot; Having sent my goods to your vessel, the&apos; C/iarlie,&apos; for 
Auckland^ on the faith of your representation that she 
would sail about the 1st September^ and the vessel being 
still in the docks, I give you notice that I shall hold you 
responsible for damage I may sustain by reason of delay ;** 
and, 

To this the defendants replied : &quot;We have to inform you 
that the &apos; Charlie&apos; will leave the docks on the 5th proximo. 
We do not accept any responsibility in the matter referred 
to; it rests with the ship.&quot; And, in answer to another 
enquiry as to the port of discharge, the defendants wrote 
thus:— 

&quot; Our agreement with the owner of the &apos;Charlie is, that 
she shall go to Auckland direct.&quot; 

The plaintiff admitted that he knew the defendants as 
ship-brokers, and that he was aware vessels did not sail 
at the exact times announced. He arranged the freight 
with them. 

Ship-brokers were called, who stated that it was the 
ordinary duty of ship-brokers to arrange freight, receive 
bills of lading, and hand them to shipper; but that, if the 
broker gave an engagement that the ship should sail at a 
particular time, he was answerable for its not sailing at or 
about that time. 

These witnesses, moreover, stated that they could not 
tell, from the terms of the ticket or card, whether (he de- 
fendants were owners or brokers, and that several owners 
loaded their own vessels as brokers. 

One of the plaintifTs witnesses, a broker of experience, 
acknowledged that he would not have judged, from the 
ticket, that the defendants were owners. 

For the defendants, a witness was called, who proved 
that, for this particular ship, they had acted as brokers ; 
but he admitted that the defendants were owners of ships, 
and of one of the ships mentioned on the card, and that the 



SITTINGS—QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



429 



card was one which might be issued by them as owners ; 
although, he said^ he should have judged from the card 
that they were only brokers. . 

Ship-brokers were called for the defendants, who con- 
firmed the latter view, stating that the card was in the 
usual form of cards issued by brokers; but they also ad- 
mitted that, if the brokers owned a ship, they would issue 
cards in a similar form. 

The defendants themselves were called, and, while 
stating that persons in the trade would, from the terms of 
the ticket, have understood that they were brokers, ad- 
mitted that if they had been owners the card would have 
been in the same form. 

CocKBURK, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The parties with whom 
the plaintiff and his agent came into communication, were, 
no doubt, the defendants. But the question is, whether 
they were acting on their own behalf or merely as brokers, 
and as agents for the owners? If, indeed, they held them- 
selves out to the plaintiff as the owners, they could not 
now say they were only agents. But the question is, 
whether they did so hold themselves out? And that ques- 
tion seems to come to this: what the advertisement and 
ticket held out to the mercantile world ? If in these docu- 
ments the defendants held themselves out as owners, then 
they would be liable. The question then, is, what did 
those documents mean, and convey, to the minds of mer- 
cantile men? That is for you, upon the evidence, to 
judge.* 

The evidence is, that brokers, whether owners or not (as 
sometimes they may happen to be), always advertise in the 
forms here used ; so that merchants do not understand it 
as conveying that the brokers are necessarily owners. If 
the plaintiff, as a mercantile man, must be taken to have 
understood that the defendants were only acting as agents, 
they are not liable.

BLYTH AND ANOTHER V. 8AMUDA. 

Declaration on a contract by the defendant to 
build a steam-boat, similar to one mentioned in a certain 
contract by plaintifls, upon builder&apos;s plans to be prepared 
for the approval of the plaintifis^ and in accordance with 
the specification set forth at the foot of the agreement, the 
hull to be built in accordance with the contract, and to be 
put together in frames of the description or dimensions 
contained in, and conformably to, the said specification, 
and to execute in a workmanlike manner, and of the best 
materials, all the iron work and the other&apos; work in the 
specification mentioned,&amp;c. 

Breach, that the ship the defendant built was not con- 
structed according to the specification, and was in parts 
built of bad and improper materials, and in parts built in 
a bad and unworkmanlike manner, and divers matters re- 
quired by the agreement were omitted, and in divers parts 
the ship was weak and insufficient in strength, and of less 
value than it would otherwise have been. 

Pleas: 1. That the vessel was built according to the 



agreement. 



acceptance of the vessel as altered ; and if so, the plaintiffs could not recover

2. Setting out the agreement, and alleging that the ship 
was bailt in accordance with it, except in certain parts and 
respects, as to which certain variations, deviations and 
omissions from the specification, in and during the con- 
struction of the vessel, were made by and according to the 
directions, and by and with the leave and license or con« 
sent, of the plaintiffs, or one of them,&amp;c. Issue. 

Bovilly Lush and R. E. Turner for the plaintiffs. 

Sir W. Atherton, S.-G., and Cleasly for the defendant. 

The contract was in June, 1858, between the defendant 
and J.&amp;A. BIyth. It was for a steam-boat, to be completed 
in January, 1859. It provided, that if the ship should not 
be built according to contract, it might be rejected, and 
the money paid for it recovered, the money being paid by 
instalments at certain stages, and the plaintiffs to have free 
ingress, with their agents, to the place where the vessel 
should be built. It was to be dehvered in the Thames. 
The plaintiffs had previously entered into a contract with a 
company at Mayence to furnish a tug-boat for river navi- 
gation, to be delivered at Rotterdam, and this was shown 
to the defendant, and was the contract referred to in his 
agreement with the plaintiffs. 

The plaintiffs appointed one Harrington to look after the 
building of the steam-boat, and in December^ 1858, having 
received notice from him of a deviation, in substituting 
wood deck-beams and &quot;shelves,&quot; they wrote to the de- 
fendant, telling him that the responsibility of the vessel 
proving satisfactory to the Mayence Company would rest 
with him. He answered that the Mayence Company had, 
in their specification, required wood deck-beams, and that 
when wooden beams were adopted a wooden shelf was in- 
variably used to attach them to, not an iron one. The 
plaintiffs replied that they were glad the defendant knew 
these alterations would be satisfactory to the Mayen&apos;ce 
firm. When completed, engines were fitted in by the

plaintiffs. The steam-boat was then taken over to Rotter- 
dam, when it was found that some of the iron plates had 
bent and some of the wood-work was broken, and the 
vessel not being in a fit state to undergo the trials stipu- 
lated for by the Mayence Company, they refused to ac- 
cept it. 

The case for the plaintiffs now was, that, through the 
substitution of wooden ** shelves&quot; and beams for tron, the 
vessel had been so weakened that it had not strength to 
resist the action oF the waves, and had consequently bent, 
or &apos;&apos; buckled,&apos;* causing the injuries referred to, and which 
made her useless. 

But the plaintiffs admitted that the vessel, having been 
launched in December, 1859, had taken trial trips in April, 
1860, which were satisfactory, before the voyage to Rot- 
terdam, and that the injuries occurred in the course of the 
voyage^ which was in June, in rather rough weather. They 
declared, however, that they had not been fully aware of 
the substitution of wooden beams and shelves for iron 
until their arrival at Rotterdam — that is, that they were 
not aware ^&apos; of the full extent of the deviation,&apos;* though, as 
already stated, they themselves had fitted-in the engines. 

The plaintiffs further admitted that there had been time, 
between December, 1859, and April, 1860, to substitute 
iron stringers or beams for wooden, had they insisted on 
its being done, but they had not insisted on it. 

Harrington, the plaintiffs&apos; engineer, was called, and ad« 
mitted that he saw the vessel every week, and knew that 
the wooden beams were being put in, on which account he 
wrote the letter already alluded to. The company had 
sent over a director, and also their captain, to inspect the 
vessel, and they examined it three times and expressed no 
dissatisfaction. 

In July the agents of the defendant inspected the vessel 
at Rotterdam, and ascribed the injuries to weakness occa- 
sioned by the fitting-in of the engines and the violence of 



SITTINGS—QUEEN&apos;S BENCH.

the weather, the ship not being built for ocean naviga- 
tion (a). 

In August, I860, the plaintiffs gave notice to the defend- 
ant that the vessel would be hauled up and inspected, and 
in September an inspection took place. In December the 
vessel was sold to the Mayence Company for 1,450Z. The 
plaintiffs had paid to the defendant the whole price, 5,000Z. 
The contract price with the company was 12,000/., of 
which they had received 9,000/. 

There was a conflict of evidence between the witnesses 
for the plaintiffs and those which were called for the de- 
fendant, as- to whether iron &quot; stringers&quot; were better than 
wooden. The witnesses for the defendant said that this 
was only so as regarded sea-going vessels, and that the 
damage would have been greater if iron had been used. 
And there was a great contest of evidence also as to the 
cause of the &quot; buckling.&quot; 

The defendant insisted that his main plea was proved. 

CocKBUBN, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The defence is, in sub- 
stance, that the contract was departed from with the con- 
sent of the plaintiffs. It is clear that they knew of the 
alterations, and instead of rejecting the vessel, they ac- 
cepted it as it was built; and if so, and if they assented to 
the alterations, they cannot now complain. What is the 
fair construction of the letters which passed between the 
parties, and of their subsequent conduct? If the plaintiffs* 
assent to the alterations was absolute, of course they are 
now concluded. If conditional on the approval of the 
Mayence Company, was there not that approval ? If so, 
then the condition was satisfied, and the assent became 
absolute. And after the inspections by the agents- of the 
company, was it not clear that the company would have 
accepted the vessel as it was then built and launched? 
Supposing the plaintiffs assented to the substitution of

^&quot;^^ sponsible for the consequences of the substitution, even 
and Another assuming that it caused the injuries which occurred. And 
Samuda. 6ven if the assent was with a reservation of all responsi- 
bilities, or was conditional on the ultimate approval by the 
Maycncc Company, the plaintiffs had no right to retain 
the vessel, after the company&apos;s rejection of it, for six 
months, from June to December, 1860. If you think that 
was an unreasonable delay, and in that view, even sup- 
posing there was no assent to the alterations, the action 
would not be maintainable. If, however, you are of opinion 
thut there was neither assent to nor ratification of the 
alterations, and no unreasonable delay, nor acceptance of 
the vessel, then find a verdict for the plaintiffs, and then 
consider the question of damages, as to which there is a 
conflict of evidence, on which you must exercise your judg- 
ment. 

No doubt the defendant has departed from the specifica- 
tion, and unless there was assent or acceptance or ratifica- 
tion, you must find for the plaintifis for such damages as 
you think proper. 

The questions for you, then, are — 

1. Was the specification departed from? 

2. Was there consent by the plaintifis to the deviation? 

3. Was there acceptance by the plaintiffs of the vessel? 

4. Did the plaintifls retain it an unreasonable time? 
6. If not, what are the damages?

tenant to do tenant&apos;s repairs, and the landlord substantial 
repairs.

written agreement with the defendant Robert Faux, to let 
him the yard and buildings now in question, a portion of 
the first-mentioned premises for a year from old Michael* 
mas then next (11th October), and so from year to year at

party ; by a memorandum at the foot that he consented to 
transfer his interest in the premises to his brother. 

In December^ 1857, all the buildings demised by the 
second agreement were destroyed by an accidental fire, and 
neither party had rebuilt them, nor had the tenant paid 
rent since Michaelmas, 1857, and declined to do so. No 
notice had been given on either side to determine the te- 
nancy, but defendant had ceased to occupy. 

On the 26th December, 1859, the plaintiff wrote to the 
defendant to this effect: — &quot;Your term in the premises 
you took of me expired on the 11th October last, and as 
you have not paid any rent since the fire, I apply to you 
for arrears of rent to Michaelmas last, and also to restore 
the buildings or pay me the value, your contract being to 
leave them in good repair.*&apos; 

On the 27th March, 1860, the plaintiff gave defendant 
notice to quit at Michaelmas. 

Dighy Seymour called Edward Faux, who swore that in 
December, 1855, he saw the plaintiff, told him he was 
going to have the yard and buildings again, paid him 30/., 
taking a receipt, produced, in these terms : — &quot; Received of

Company, ^ere those of Messrs. Morley, and had been lighted by 
the gas of another gas company. The defendants had 
been engaged to supply gas for those premises, and their 
men on the day of the explosion were engaged on the 
work necessary to lay the gas on thereto. The pipe from 
the other gas company (&quot; the Chartered &quot;) entered the 
premises through a hole in the basement^ and they even 
had enlarged the hole, and also made a trench from the 
wall to their main about three hei distance. Before 
going further ihey asked the persons on Messrs. Morley&apos;s 
premises if it were necessary that the gas burners in the 
basement should be alight? and were told that it was. 
They then proceeded to tap a hole in the main, for the 
purpose of admitting the service pipe. There were windows 
in the basement, through a little hole on the level of the 
pavement. Close to the hole in the wall was the meter of 
the other gas company. A little before eleven o&apos;clock a 
strong smell of gas was observed in the basement ^ and soon 
after there was an explosion which set the house on flames 
and set fire to the plaintiff&apos;s house adjoining. 

The case o]l^ned for the plaintiff as regarded negligence 
was, that the operation of tapping the main to admit the 
service pipe, ought not to have taken place without a pro* 
cess called &quot; bladdering,&quot; which consisted in the insertion of 
a kind of wedge in the main, below the orifice cut for the 
admission of the service pipes, so as to prevent the escape 
of gas through that opening ; and it was suggested that 
there had been a current of gas along the trench and 
through the hole and window into the basement where 
lights were burning, which ignited and exploded ihe gas; 
that this was a result which might have been reasonably

and the simple precaution referred to would have prevented Bj^gj,|^,|^o^ 

all danger, its omission was nedis;ence which rendered v. 

The Grkat 
the defendants liable. But the witnesses called for the central Gas 

plaintiff could not go the length of saying that the precau- ^JmpajTy&quot; 
tion was general ; not that it was done in many instances. 
And skilled witnesses were called for the defendants to 
prove that it was 7iot a necessary or ordinary precaution ; 
on the other hand, some of the witnesses for the defend- 
ants admitted, that, under the circumstances, it would have 
been proper to adopt every precaution to prevent danger of 
ignition of the gas by means of the lights burning ; and 
that it would have been prudent to close the windows or 
any other opening into the house before allowing the gas 
to escape, as it would be certain to ignite afler a certain 
quantity of it had entered the place where lights were 
burning. 

Hawkins in reply relied chiefly on this. 

[There was some cross-examination of plaintiff&apos;s wit- 
nesses, with a view to show that there might have been an 
escape of gas from some of the burners of the other gas 
company, but the case did not turn on that.] 

Ck&gt;CKBURN, C.J. (to the jury). — ^There are two questions 
for you. 1. Whether the gas which exploded proceeded 
from the defendants&apos; main ; and 2. Whether in any thing 
which their servants did, or omitted to do, there was such 
negligence as to make the defendants responsible. The 
first point depends on the facts and mainly on this, whether 
the escape of gas was gradual or sudden, for if sudden, 
it probably was from the hole opened by the defendants&apos; 
servants in their main. 

As to the second, the real question, you have to deter- 
mine, is, whether there was negligence on the part of 
the defendants&apos; men, for if so, the defendants are respon- 
sible, that negligence may be either in omitting to do

COMFANY. 

The ground of negligence put forth in the opening ap- 
pears to have b^en either abandoned or not so much relied 
upon at the close of the case. The main ground now relied 
upon by the plaintiff appears to be this, that the whole 
thing was done with a careless disregard to the safety of 
the adjoining premises ; that care should have been taken 
to prevent the entry of gas into the premises where lights 
were knewn to be burning. And upon that the question 
is, whether the company&apos;s servants did what was necessary 
wiih reference to ordinary and reasonable care? That the 
operation was one of some danger cannot be denied, not 
only does the event prove it, but the witnesses all concur 
in this, that to allow a quantity of gas to escape into pre- 
mises where lights are burning was necessarily attended 
with danger of ignition, and must have been known to be 
so ; and those who carry on operations dangerous to the 
public are bound to use all reasonable precautions — all the 
precautions which ordinary reason and experience might 
suggest to prevent the danger. It is not enough that they 
do what is usual if the course ordinarily pursued is impru- 
dent and careless ; for no one can claim to be excused for 
want of care because others are as careless as himself; on 
the other hand, in considering what is reasonable, it is im- 
portant to consider what is usually done by persons acting 
in a similar business. Now it appears that the hole in the 
wall was stopped up, but the window was not closed, and 
this is the negligence now mainly imputed by the plaintiff; 
on the other side it is- contended, that it was not to be ex- 
pected that the gas would go through the window. Here 
two questions arise, first, did it do so? and, secondly, 
ought the men to have foreseen that it might do so ? Was 



SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 441 

there a want of proper care and caution in allowing the i860. 

escape of gas from the main without first closing that ^&apos;^&apos;^&apos;^^

answer to the action by the present plaintiff. It is for you 

to consider whether the defendants&apos; servants ought not to 

have either insisted on the lights being put out or have 

the windows closed. And if they did what was necessarily 

dangerous under circumstances, making it additionally 

dangerous, with a want of due care, find for the plaintiff, 

if not, for the defendants. 

The jury were directed as to whether the defendants&apos; gas 

caused the explosion, but were unanimous in finding that 

they used all reasonable precaution. 

Hawkins applied instantly for a nonsuit ; but

to receive a complete cargo, so far as the ship can reason- 
ably stow and load, and to receive it &quot; alongside the ship&quot; 
at that port. 

The cause was partly tried upon admissions, which 
stated, inter alia, that Larache was a port with a bar, inside 
of which it was impossible for the ship to continue long 
enough to load a complete cargo, by reason of the low 
depth of water, and that after loading as far as she could 
inside the bar, she went outside the bar, to the nearest 
place convenient for loading, which, however, was at a dis- 
tance from Larache. 

The felucca mentioned in the set-off had been employed 
to convey the rest of the cai^o alongside of the ship at that 
place, and the charges thus incurred formed the subject of 
the set-off. 

It was contended for the defendant that the master had 
contracted to receive the cargo at Larache^ and therefore 
must bear the extra expense of conveying it to another 
place ; but 

WiGHTMAN, J., thought Otherwise, and left the case to 
the jury.

(a) Gruy moved in T. T. but 
took nothing ; the Court being of 
opinion, on the construction of the 
charter, that the port of Larache did 
not necessarily mean inside the 
bar, or at the place called Larache, 
that the charter bound the master 
to receive the cargo alongside the 
ship, and that this meant wherever 
at the port of Larache she could 
safely be loaded, and that the char- 
ter could not reasonably mean that 



the ship was to be loaded inside the 
bar until she stranded, or that the 
shipowner was to be responsible 
for a natural obstacle which must 
be supposed to be equally in the 
knowledge of botli parties; that 
even if the freighter was not bound 
to load there he bad done to, and 
could not now throw the extra 
charge on the shipowner. See

In September he assigned these effects to the plaintiff. In 
November he left, and another person went into possession, 
and carried on the business until January. Haseldon, 
however, had left behind him some of these fittings,&amp;c., 
and subsequently, the plaintiff, having got from one Grove, 
the company&apos;s manager of the department, his assent to 
their removal, applied to one Thompson, a servant of the 
company, who had charge of that part of the premises, to 
let him have them, which Thompson declined to do, saying 
at first that he did not know him. Haseldon then went 
with the plaintiff to Thompson, told him of the assignment, 
stated who the plaintiff was, and that he was the owner, 
and appealed to Grove&apos;s letter. Thompson, however, still 
declined to deliver them unless Barnett would give a 
written receipt for them and show the bill of sale, which 
he refused to do, and the next day issued the writ in this 
action. Grove, after the writ, said, &quot; Why did he not de- 
liver them ?*&apos; but they had not been offered before or after 
the action. 

It was admitted that Grove had authority from the com-

Man, appeared^ aware. TLe plaintiff agreed to the letting, and 
desired the defendant to arrange it, which he did, the terms 
being a monthly rent payable in advance, the letting being 
for a year. Evans entered and paid two months&apos; rent as 
agreed, but then finding himself insolvent, proposed to 
give one or two months&apos; notice and to leave, but to this the 
plaintiff would not agree, and he left without paying any- 
thing more. The plaintiff said she had not been able to 
let the house for the remainder of the year. The defendant 
had sent her a bill for commission, at five per cent., on a 
year&apos;s rent, which she had paid. 

Upon these facts it was contended for the defendant 
that there was no cause of action, the plaintiff having 
been satis6ed with the defendant&apos;s statements, which 
were made bond fide ; that it was enough if a house-agent 
introduced a person to his employer bona fide, and that, at 
all events, he was not bound to make further inquiries in 
this particular case. 

Blackburn, J., left it to the jury whether the nature of 
the employment was such as that he was not bound to 
make inquiries, or whether it was such as did impose that 
duty. If so, then he told them the defendant was bound 
to use due care to discharge such duty, and left it to them 
to consider whether he had done so, and whether, by 
reasonable inquiries, he might not have found out the

chased wholesale, and supplied to the members accord- 
ing to their respective subscriptions. There was a secre- 
tary or manager, and trustees, and a committee; but the 
actual management was in the secretary. From the 
evidence of a member of the committee of 1857, it ap- 
peared that the subscriptions, as received by the secretary, 
were paid into a bank in the names of the trustees ; that 
the secretary ordered such coals as he judged would be 
wanted; that, if he could get the necessary quantity for less 
than the amount made up by the subscriptions, it was an 
&quot; off-set,&quot; but the witness could not say what became of 
the overplus of any coals obtained. And the witness and 
another, called for the plaintiffs did not know of any 
authority to the secretary to pledge the credit of the 
society ; on the contrary, stated that they never authorized 
coals to be ordered until the money had all been received 
by the secretary. He said, the very object of the club was, 

H h2 




448 CASES AT THE 

by paying ready money for the coals, to get them at a 
cheaper rate ; and that, consequently, the secretary had no 
authority to order coals except for ready money. At the 
same time, it was stated that the secretary sold coals on his 
own account, and that he bought coals where he pleased ; 
and, so that the club had what they wanted, sold as he 
pleased. 

In the autumn of 1857 all the subscriptions had been 
paid before the 29th September, and the secretary had 
then ordered a cargo of coals, which arrived in October. 

The defendant was one of the three trustees in that year, 
and they had opened an account at a bank in February, 
1867, which continued until March, 1858. 

The banker&apos;s books were produced, and it appeared 
that, on the 24th September, 1857, the account was 
reduced to 31Z. II5. llcf., having been reduced to that sum 
by payments of 86/. And, in the month of March, 1868, 
the account was settled by payment to the trustees of 19/., 
the balance due at that time. 

It did not appear, however, to whom the sums had been 
paid, which had been drawn out prior to September 29th, 
1867. 

And it came out that when the cargo arrived the secre* 
tary had sold coals out of it on his own account. 

There had been no communication whatever between the 
plaintiff and defendant.

uf the following case :— By the rules 
of a coal-club (duly certified), pro- 
vision was made for the appoint- 
ment of a chainnan, secretary and 
treasurer, the latter of whom was to 
receive all monies taken by the se- 
cretary, and to pay the coal-mer- 
chant as soon after every delivery 
of coals as he should receive an 
order signed by the secretary and 
chairman. It was then provided 
that certain weekly payments should 
be made by the members to the se- 
cretary, who were to be entitled at 
the end of twelve weeks to receive 
half a ton of coals for each share 
held by them. It was further pro- 
vided, that the secretary should, on 
the requisition of the members pre- 
sent at a meeting, apply for tenders 
to such coal merchants as they 
should direct ; that, when a tender 
was accepted at the following meet- 
ing, the secretary should agree with 
the merchant for the required sup- 
ply, — the coals to be paid for •&apos; on 
the next Thursday night after each 
delivery, by an order on the trea- 
surer, signed by the secretary and 
chairman.&quot; The plaintiff having 
tendered to supply the club with 
about 100 tons of coals, at 23s. 
per ton, the secretary prepared an 



agreement for&lt;* 100 tons, more or 
less,&quot; at that price, which was 
signed by himself and the plaintiff, 
but, through the default of the se- 
cretary, there were not sufficient 
funds in the treasurer&apos;s hands to pay 
for them. 

Held, that the secretary was the 
mere servan{ of the general body, 
and must be taken to have acted in 
that capacity in giving the order 
for the coals ; that, as the club 
never parted with their control over 
the money in the hands of the 
treasurer, or authorized the iecrc&apos; 
tuTjf to expend it, but gave him au- 
thority to order the coals for them, 
and did not furnish him with funds 
to pay for them, but authorized a 
contract on credit, the contract so 
made must bt taken to have tfeen 
made on their credit, and conse- 
quently the defendant, as a member 
of the club, was liable. Cockerell

of the defendant, in Cavendish Square, belons:ing to a

V, house of herSy let to one Deacon, on a term just about to 

TueCountess 

OP Oxford, expire. The plaintiff happened to be employed to rebuild 
adjoining stables, which he found it difficult to do without 
rebuilding those of the defendant, which were in a ruinous 
state. He therefore inquired at the house, and was re- 
ferred by Mr. Deacon&apos;s&apos; butler to one Harrison, who ap- 
peared to have done some jobs for the defendant in the 
employment of her agent, a Mr. Chichester, but who had 
no authority to order anything to be done for the defendant 
or for her agent, both of whom were at this titpe out of 
the country. At the suggestion, it should seem, of Har- 
rison, the plaintiff applied to the Metropolitan Building 
Board, from whom there soon issued an order to rebuild 
the stables ; the notices were sent to Harrison, who there- 
upon directed the plaintiff to do the requisite work, which 
he did. There was no communication between either 
Harrison or the plaintiff and Mr. Chichester, or the de- 
fendant; nor did Mr. Chichester know of the work having 
been done until the bill was sent in for 134/. He there- 
upon wrote to Harrison and received no reply, nor did he 
himself send any. 

Then the plaintiff&apos;s attorney wrote, and Mr. Chichester 
again wrote, to Harrison, but sent no answer. After a 
delay of some months the present action was commenced, 
and Mr. Chichester then went to the plaintiff&apos;s attorney and 
said that, although there had been no authority to have

any litigation the defendant would pay it. Costs had been 
incurred, however, and there was a difference on that head*

certificate of what was due, and lOZ. for costs.

Mr. Chichester was called, and his statement was not 
contradicted, and was to the effect above stated. 

Harrison was too ill to attend the trial, and had been 
examined on interrogatories, which were put in on the 
part of the plaintiff. 

WiGHTMAN, J. (to the jury). — ^There is no evidence of 
any authority given by Chichester to Harrison to order 
this work, or of Harrison being the defendant&apos;s agent. 
The sole question is, whether, after the work was done, 
Chichester, who had authority from him in such matters, 
adopted or ratified what had been done.

nothing to the plain tifi^, as it was 
for the defendant&apos;s agent to obtain 
it, if he desired it, or to satisfy him-

In May, I860, the plaintiff being with his ship at Car« 
diff, employed Ceriez k Co., ship-brokers there, to find him 
a charter, and they offered him one at 32s* 6d., and intro- 
duced him to defendant, a colliery owner, as chartered. 
On the 18th May, a charter-party, to the effect stated in 
the declaration, was signed by plaintiff and defendant, de- 
scribing defendant as &quot;agent for merchant;&quot; but it stated 
that the ship was to load a cargo of the defendant&apos;s coals, 




464 CASfiS AT THE 

1861. which the merchant bound himself to provide, the cargo to 
be delivered at Rio, the freight to be paid, one-third on 
signing bill of lading, by bill or cash, at the merchant&apos;s 
option, remainder by approved bills. The usual commis- 
sion of 5 per cent, was made payable, and the defendant 
stipulated with the plaintiff&apos;s brokers that they should only 
have one-third of it, and the defendant the rest. 

On the 19th May the defendant sent Eason a charter 
for the same, and on the 21st it was accepted by him un- 
known to plaintiff at 33^. 6d, per ton. In this charter 
Jones described himself as agent of the ship, and signed 
&apos;*by authority of Holten,*&apos; the plaintiff, but without, in 
fact, the plaintiff even knowing of it. 

On the 6th June, the plaintiff received a cargo, and gave 
bills of lading as for a shipment by one Eason. The cargo 
was in fact shipped by defendant, and plaintiff did not 
know of Eason until the cargo was shipped. Ceriez 
offered plaintiff a bill accepted by Eason for 186/., which 
the plaintiff received. The one-third of the freight would 
amount to 190/., but, deducting insurance, the amount 
would be 181/. Ceriez explained that Eason had re-char- 
tered the ship at a difference of \s. a ton, and that the 
plaintiff would be paid the remaining two-thirds at Rio at 
the rate of 33«. 6rf. per ton, showing him a copy of the re- 
charter, and asking him to give a note for 17/. for the 
difference of 1^. per ton, which the plaintiff did, and gave 
a receipt for 196/. as received from Eason per Jones by bill, 
on account of freight. 

In August the plaintiff arrived at Rio, and then heard 
by a letter, dated July 7th, that Eason had stopped pay- 
ment while the bill was running. 

The cargo was deliverable at Rio to Naylor&amp;Co., 
holders of the bill of lading, who offered to pay the two- 
thirds freight but not the one-third, which, however, they 
remitted to Todd&amp;Co., their agents at Liverpool, subject 
to the claims of the plaintiff. The cargo was then d0- 




SITTINGS—COMMON PLEAS. 456 

livered to them. They remitted to Todd&amp;Co. 196/. as ^^ 
deposit for the security of the owners of the vessel to claim 
their right in case the bill given by the shipper and char- 
terer (Eason) for one-third amount of freight should not 
have been duly honoured, which it was not. Hence the 
present action. 

Keating, J., made an order at Chambers, on summons 
by the plaintiff, that he should be allowed to inspect and 
take copies of all letters received by the defendant from 
Eason relating to the charter-party, and all letters written 
by defendant to Eason in any way relating thereto. 

The plaintiff being called, denied that he had read the 
second charter until he got to Rio, or that he had noticed 
the terms of the bill of lading. 

Eason was called for the plaintiff, and the letters between 
him and the defendant were put in, from which it appeared 
that Eason had employed him to procure a charter, and 
had received from him bills of lading, sending his bill for 
the one-third freight. 

He swore that he had never heard of the original charter 
until quite lately. 

Ceriez was likewise called for the plaintiff, and stated 
that the cargo was shipped by defendant, who had told 
him that the ship was re-chartered at Is. difference, and 
that this was the reason the note was given for the differ- 
ence; that he never agreed to cancel the first charter, 
and that the plaintiff&apos;s attention had been called to the 
fact that the second charter was in the name of Eason, 
but that the captain insisted on taking the first charter 
with him. 

Phinn, for the defendant, submitted : — 

1. (As to the first count.) That there was no warranty 

of an authority to contract on behalf of any third party, 

and that as the defendant might have sued on the first 

charter (a) he was contracted with as principal. And that^

,_ want of aathority, for that the onlv real damage was the

nonpayment by Eason of his bill. And further, that the 
bill was accepted by plaintiff in satisfaction on the second 
charter, taken in substitution for the first. 

2. (As to the second count) On a fraudulent represen- 
tation of authority. There was no evidence ot fraud on 
tlie part of the defendant ; and, even if there were fraud, 
no damage had resulted from it, nor had plaintiff shipped 
the cargo on the faith of the authority. 

3. (As to the claim under the common counts.) That 
Eason was shipper and charterer^ and so described, and 
that the plaintiff had notice of the second charter before 
the loading or signing of bills of lading. 

Honyman, for the plaintiff, answered : — 

1. That there was a clear warranty of authority; and 
that, if there was not, then that the defendant was liable 
under the common counts, the contract having been 
executed by the plaintiff. 

2. That there was no plea to raise the question of satis- 
faction or substitution, and no evidence of it. 

3. Tliat there was no answer to the claim on the com- 
mon counts, the evidence being that the cai^o was actually 
loaded brfore the plaintiff heard of the re-charter. 

Williams, J. — It seems to me that the question of fraud 
is immaterial, and that the primary question is for the 
jury; for, if there were a warranty of authority, the de- 
fendant would be liable; and if not, and the cargo was 
shipped under the first charter, then he would be liable 
under the common count. The plaintiff says, &quot; although 
there was a sub-charter, I was acting under the original 
charter ;&quot; that is, in substance, his case, whether as regards 
the right of action or the damage. Is it not, then, in the 
first instance, a question for the jury? reserving the points 
of law if they become material. 




SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS- EXCHEQUER. 457 

Phinn then called the defendant, who swore that, before 1861. 
the ship was loaded, he had told Ceriez, the plaintiff&apos;s 
broker, that he had re-chartered the ship at an advanced 
freight, and that when the bills of lading were signed the 
plaintiff agreed to adopt the second charter. 

Williams, J., left the case to the jury, on the question, 
whether the plaintiff had loaded and acted under the 
second charter or the first. 

By consent you are discharged from finding a verdict on 
the second count, as to fraud.

The defendant had obtained an order for better particu- 
lars of the breaches relied on, which were as follows : — 

That the contractors did not construct the Grove tunnel 
and Strawberry Hill tunnel of the materials specified in the 
contract and specification^ nor did they use in the con- 
struction of such tunnels materials of good or sufficient 
quality, nor put such materials together in a good, work- 
manlike or proper manner, nor construct the walls or 
arches according to the contract and specification, but con- 
structed the said tunnels in so unsafe and improper a 
manner that the plaintiffs were obliged to expend large 
sums of money in lining such tunnels with additional walls 
and arches, and that the contractors did not maintain the 
said tunnels, for the period required by the contract, in 
good and proper condition, as required by the contract, 
and left them during all that period so constructed as in 
these particulars above mentioned (a). 

These particulars being deemed too general, and Bram- 
WELL, B., and Martin, B., having ordered &quot; further and 
better,&quot; they were re-delivered as follows: — 

&quot; That the contractors, in constructing the Grove tunnel 
and Strawberry Hill tunnel, did not use bricks, mortar or 
cement of the quality specified in the contract and specifi- 
cation, or of good and sufficient quality, nor build the walls 
and arches of the tunnels in good and workmanlike, proper

(a) A general clause was added, 
reserving a right to the plaintiffs of 
availing themselves of any evidence 
of further breaches or damage 
which might transpire on the trial. 
But this was struck out by an order 



of Chan NELL, B., on the 29th 
June, ai\er notice of trial, and the 
learned Baron observed, that the 
particulars even as they would then 
stand were rather general, and 
scarcely sufficient.

and sufficient manner, nor of the thickness of four rings, as 
required by the contract and specification, nor with the. 
materials nor in the manner mentioned therein/&apos;&amp;c. 

WiLLBSi J., held these particulars still insufficient, and 
directed &quot; further and better&quot; to be delivered, which ran 
as follows : — 

&apos;&apos;That the contractors did not construct the walls or 
arches of the tunnels of the thickness of four rings, as re- 
quired by the contract, but of the thickness of one ring 
only, with the exception of some parts of the Strawberry 
Hill tunnel, in which the contractors put two rings, loose 
bricks and rubbish, without cement or mortar, being used 
by the contractors in the place of the other two or three 
rings,&quot;&amp;c. 

[The contract, as will be seen, required four rings of 
hrick&apos;Work in the walls and arches of the tunnels.] 

The plaintiffs declared that they could not give further 
or better particulars than the above, as they had not taken 
down the tunnels, though they had cut holes into them to 
inspect them, and had re-lined them with additional tiers 
or rings of brick-work. 

The contract provided that the tunnels should consist of 
a brick arch and side walls (of certain specified dimensions), 
both the arch and side walls to be of the thickness shown 
on the drawings, viz., four &quot; rings&quot; of brick-work. Where 
the nature of the ground would, in the opinion of the 
engineer, permit with safety a less thickness of brick-work 
to be used in the arch or side walls, a deduction to be 
made from the contract price of the amount of work saved. 

The contractors were, according to the contract, to do 
the work to the satisfaction of the engineer. &quot; And in case 
any materials not corresponding with the specification 
should be brought to the works, the engineer may require 
the contractors to remove the same,&quot;&amp;c. &quot; And in case 
any part of the works shall have been executed in an im* 



SITTINGS-EXCHEQUER. 



461 



proper manner^ as regards workmanship or maierialsy the 
engineer may require the contractors to remove and re- 
execute the same.&quot; 

By the contract, it was provided that the works should 
be executed under the inspection and control of the com- 
pany&apos;s resident engineer, and to the satisfaction of the 
engineer and resident engineer. Payments to be made on 
the certificate of the engineer. 

The works were executed under such inspection, and all 
the payments were made under such certificates of satisfac- 
tion, and there was a like certificate of final completion. 

There was a clause in the contract, &apos;&apos; that if the engineer 
of the company shall deviate in any respect from the spe- 
cification, or cause any deviations, the same shall not 
vacate the contract.*&apos; And further, that the contractors 
should not be permitted to make any deviations without 
an order in writing, and the value of any such additions, 
omissions or deviations should be ascertained according to 
the schedule of pi ices, and the amount thereof either added 
to or deducted from the amount of the contract. 

The first-mentioned tunnel was completed in February, 
1848, the other in December, 1849. 

The works were finished about August, 1851. During 
the whole time Mr. Barlow was chief engineer and Mr, 
Richardson resident engineer at the works, and two per- 
sons (both since dead). Buttress and Perch, were employed 
in the two tunnels referred to, under Richardson, to report 
to him weekly in writing as to the nature, quantity and 
quality of the work done therein. 

By the contract the works were to be maintained by the 
contractors for a year after completion, and during that 
period one Mr. Deane succeeded Mr. Barlow as engineer 
in chief; and he, in the early part of 1852, along with 
Richardson, inspected the works with a view to the 
final settlement of accounts. And in October, 1852, he 
certified about 8,500/. to be due to the contractors, &apos;^sub- 

VOL. II. I I F.P. 



1861. 




462 



CASES AT THE

ject to such counter claims as the company may have/&apos; 
but of which no more particular mention was made. In 
December, 1852, he increased his estimate of the amount 
due to the contractors to a sum of nearly 13,0002., and 
certified for that sum. 

On the 30th December, 1852, the contractors wrote to 
Deane thus : — 

&quot; We agree to accept your final certificate ; we abandon 
our claim to the sum of 3,000/., the balance of the 10,000/. 
(a kind of bonus which liad been promised by the com- 
pany); and we agree to have our claim for compensation, 
as per account, referred to arbitration. * * ♦ It being 
understood that the balance due under your certificate be 
forthwith paid, and that no counter claims on either side 
be advanced beyond our claim for compensation before 
referred to.&quot; 

Subsequently the certificate was increased to 13,397/., 
which was paid, and for which the following receipt was 
given :—&quot; Received of the S. E. R. C. the sum of 13,397/., 
being the agreed balance due from the company in respect 
of our claims against the company, except those mentioned 
in an account delivered by us to the company, and which 
claims are to be referred to arbitration, on the terms of our 
letter to their engineer. 30th Dec. 1852.&quot; 

There was, as will be seen, a contest of oral evidence as 
to what passed at the interview when this settlement took 
place. 

In April, 1854, the deed of submission to arbitration 
was executed (a previous deed to the same effect having 
proved abortive through lapse of time, in consequence of 
disputes which took place); and in 1855, before the arbi- 
tration closed, the writ in this action was issued, though 
npt served until April, 1856. 

In the course of the proceedings before the arbitra- 
tion, the company&apos;s engineer complained of the imperfect 
manner in which the works had been executed, and espe- 



SITTINGS-EXCU EQUER.

cially of the tunnels, which he said the company had been 
obliged to re- line. 

But no claims on the part of the company were, or 
could be, submitted to the arbitration in regard to these 
matters; the submission, as already mentioned, being only 
of claims on the part of the contractors. In 1865 the 
engineer inspected the tunnels, and re-lined them. 

In December, 1856, the award was made in favour of 
the contractors for 7,130/., to be paid on the 1st January, 
1866, when it was paid accordingly. 

The case on the part of the company at the trial was, 
that the engineer had not done his duty in seeing that the 
brick-work of the two tunnels in question was done ac- 
cording to the contract ; and that it had been found that 
there had been only one or two rings of iricA-work in the 
arches, the residue being made up of loose bricks, which 
would not hold together, and so not only did not add to 
the strength&apos; of the arches, but increased the dead weight 
thereon, for which reason they were unsafe, and the com- 
pany had to re-line them with additional brick*work, the 
cost of which, 4,750/., they sought to recover. 

Aslicroft, an engineer appointed in 1864, was called to 
prove the case, and the result of an inspection he had 
directed in 1865, by cutting down holes or shafts into the 
brick-work of the tunnels, at intervals along their whole 
length. His testimony was confirmed by that of various 
workmen who had assisted him in the inspection, and who 
had helped to re-line the arches. 

Deane was called, and accounted for his certificates by 
saying that he took as the basis of his estimates those of 
Barlow. 

Barlow, who was chief engineer up to the time of the 
completion of the works, was also called, and stated that 
Richardson, as resident engineer, had the chief charge and 
inspection of the works under him. He denied that he

bad ever authorized less brick-work in the arches than 
specified, 

Richardson had been dismissed l)y the company, and 
was not called. 

The defendant was calledj and stated that Richardson 
was daily at the works, as were the sub-inspectors, since 
dead ; that he had employed C. and others, by sub-con- 
tract, to do the brick-work according to contract, and had 
paid them on their producing certificates of the engineers 
that the work was done; and that there was no complaint 
as to the tunnels until the arbitration. But he did not 
slate that any engineer had authorized less brick work to 
be put into the arches of the tunnels. 

The replication of fraud was abandoned. 

Pollock, C. B. (to the jury). — The contract was for 
certain specified brick-work, unless dispensed with in a 
certain way, and then allowances would have been made 
accordingly. 

Collusion between the sub-contractor and the company&apos;s 
engineer or inspector would not alter the company&apos;s rights 
under the contract. 

As to the arbitration — the arbitrators could not have 
considered the present claim, and there is no evidence 
that they did consider it. 

There is no evidence of the release, or of the plea of 
substituted work, or of award and satisfaction, nor of the 
plea that the plaintifl^s prevented the performance of the 
contract. 

The engineer, Richardson, certified work to have been 
done which had not been done, and which he and the con- 
tractor for the brick-work well knew had not been done. 

That fraudulent and collusive certificate could not bind 
the principals (a). It was a mere juggle between their re- 
spective underlings. It matters not, as to the right of 
action^ whether the defendant was a party to the fraud or

not; but^ though tlie replication of fraud having been 
abandoned, you are not altogether relieved from that 
question. 

But if the evidence for the plaintiifs is true, the fraud 
was undoubtedly practised^ and the contract was broken. 

Then the question will be one merely of damages, as to 
which the question of the defendant&apos;s privity to the fraud 
might be very material. And it is for you to consider 
whether, as the plaintiffs* engineers knew of the sub-con- 
tract, if by their neglect or fraud the defendant&apos;s sub- 
contractors were allowed to cheat him as well as the 
company, that should not be deemed to diminish the 
damages as against the defendant? 

The defendant puts his case thus : — &quot; You, the company, 
had engineers, and I knew that you had. I had to pay 
for brick-work certified by them. My sub-contractor 
cheated me. I paid for work certified falsely by your 
engineers. Had they done their duty this would not have 
occurred ; and you are in reality responsible, at all events 
^o a great degree, for the injury which ensued&quot; (a). 

That is for you to consider with reference to the question 
oif damages, although as to the righi of action it is not ma- 
terial, for no man can stave off his own responsibility and 
shift it on another. 

WeUby excepted to the ruling that the neglect or fraud 
of the company&apos;s engineers couki be considered by the 
jury in the present action. 

Pollock, C. B. — They may consider it with regard to 
the question of damages.

He commenced his examination of the books,&amp;c. qu 
the 18th April, and concluded on the 16th June. lie 
worked with a clerk. He charged 179 days at 2/. 2s. a 
day, making no distinction between himself and clerk&apos;s 
charge, the same uniform rate for the total number of 
hours for which any of them had been employed, and at 
the same rate for his clerk&apos;s services when he was absent 
as when present. 

The amount of his claim was disputed chiefly on that 
ground, but partly, also, in regard to the time he bad been 
occupied. He gave evidence himself as to both points, 
and on the former case called the most eminent account- 
ants in London, to show that it was the usual custom to 
charge one uniform rate for the accountant and clerk, and 
that 2/. 25. a day was a low rate. 

They gave divers reasons why this should be, as, that 
the skill and expense of the clerk were acquired in the 
service of the master, that in the particular work be acted 
under the directions and the control of the master, and 
that the master was responsible for the result. 

On the part of the defendants it was contended, that

it is impossible to lay down any rule except this, that 
whenever a certain rate or way of charging is usual and 
general among the most large class of persons carrying on 
an employment, it may fairly be presumed to be just and 
reasonable. There has been here very strong evidence of 
such a usage in favour of tlie plaintiff&apos;s rate of charges,

470 CASES AT THE 

1861. hearing before the magistrates^ which was to take place ou 
Monday, the 14th November, the day following. 

Those charges had been first made on the 6th October, 
in a letter from the parents of the children to the Bishop 
of Winchester, of which his lordship had sent the now 
plaintiflTa copy, and had also sent it to the visiting justices. 
They had appointed the 28th to inquire into the matter, 
and on that day he had left home, having resigned his ap- 
pointment, and kept himt^elf in retirement until, a charge 
having been preferred before the magistrates, and n warrant 
ii^sued to apprehend him, he surrendered just before the 
bearing, and the now defendants were retained to defend 
him. On the day he had lefl, his wife had written to the 
prosecutors a letter, describing him as having left home in 
a distracted state, on account of the charges made, and 
begging them not to press them further. She saw the 
senior partner of the defendants* firm (who, throughout, 
attended to the matter), and, on retaining him, showed 
him a copy of this letter. He, as she stated, on looking at 
the papers, remarked at once, that ** the case must go for 
trial.&apos;* She now stated that she told him there were wit- 
nesses — persons inmates in the house at the time — who 
could refute the charges. He did not see or examine them, 
nor take any other steps before the hearing. The inmates 
were, in addition to the plaintiff and his wife, her mother, 
two servants, a governess and two young ladies, who hap* 
pened to be there at the time, and an &apos;&apos; adopted daughter,&apos;&apos; 
Lucy Hatch, a girl of eight or nine. 

The charges made by Eugenie Plummer against the now 
plaintiff were: 1. That while in the garden with her and 
Lucy Hatch, he had taken her and put her hand into one 
of his pockets with a hole in it,&amp;c. 2. That on the night 
of a certain party in August, he had indecently assaulted 
her. 3. That for almost every night during the fortnight for 
which the girls were left at his house by the mother, he had 
gone up into the room in which she slept (by herself), and 



SIITINGS-EXCHEQUER. 47l 

committed indecent assaults. 4. That on various mornings 1S61. 
during the same period, he had the girl in his bed when h^^ck 
his wife was up, and washing, and there had committed v. 

divers indecencies. There was a similar charge as to the 
younger girl Stephanie. The matters were alleged to have 
occurred in the fortnight previous to the 24th August, 
when the children were removed. 

The senior defendant attended the hearing before the 
magistrates and called, at the desire of the plaintiff and his 
wife, Lucy Hatch, the child who was in the garden at the 
time of the offence first charged, and in the bed-room on 
the occasion of the alleged familiarities in the mornings 
when the girl was in the plaintiff&apos;s bed. The defendant 
also called Mrs. Dillon, the plaintiff&apos;s mother-in-law, and 
two of the servants, but, except Lucy Hatch, they were not 
present on any of the occasions, and only spoke to collateral 
matters, and she so far confirmed the girl that she said they 
were both with the plaintiff* in the garden on the occasion 
of the offence first charged, and sometimes left Eugenie 
with him alone for a few moments while she herself was 
running about; and it was not disputed that the girl was 
repeatedly in the plaintiff&apos;s bed in the morning, while he 
lay in it. The magistrates determined to send the case for 
trial, and, there being no one to bail the plaintiff, he was 
committed to gaol. The defendants were then retained to 
defend him, and immediately obtained a copy of the de- 
positions. At their desire, the plaintiff had drawn up a 
long statement for the information of the defendants, his 
attornies, giving the names of those inmates of his house 
who could testify fo the facts he set forth. Of this state- 
ment the following are the most material portions. It did 
not state how far the charges were false, and implied that 
the child had been in his bed while he was in it. 

&quot;She said that Mr, and Mrs. used to have them 

in their bed. [Can be sworn to by Mrs. Hatch and MrSi 
Dillon.] 




472 CASES AT THE 

1861. &quot;As to the garden charge, the answer may be made 

that we were rarely, if ever, in the garden without some 
others of the party, and mostly Mrs. Hatch. Miss Howe&apos;s 
window, and Mrs. Dillon&apos;s, overlooked the garden; and 
they could state this (a). 

&apos;&apos;As to the bed- room charges: I used to go up very 
often to wash my hands; generally soon after the children 
had been put to bed; and Lucy generally called out, ^kiss 
me/ and Eugenie used to call out, &apos; come in to me too, 
Mr. Hatch/ At this time the doors were always wide 
open. 

*&apos; Lucy Hatch can state that she was always in my room 
as I finished dressing, and that she was in the habit of 
dropping my money,&amp;c., into my pockets,&amp;c.&quot; 

The defendants prepared and delivered to Mr. Serjt. 
Ballantine a brief for the defence of the now plaintiff, 
which commenced with a circumstantial statement of the 
circumstances preceding the hearing, and then gave in 
extcnso the plaintiff&apos;s own statement. They did not them- 
selves examine, or take the proofs of the witnesses men- 
tioned in that statement. They had a conference with 
the Serjeant before delivery of the brief, in which they 
found his opinion was strong not to call witnesses, and 
after he had perused his brief, they had a consultation, and 
found his first opinion strengthened (&amp;).

ccniber, 1869. The girls, Eugenie and Stephanie, were 1861 
examined, as was their mother; and Eugenie, in her exa* 
mination, fixed the garden charge on the^r^^ day she was 
lefl at tlie house. She also stated that, though the door 
between her room and the plaintiff&apos;s was left open, the 
outer door was locked ; it was not quite clear whether she 
meant always, or on those occasions. 

In deference to the desire of the plaintiff&apos;s wife the now 
defendants liad his witnesses in attendance at the trial (a) ; 
and, had either he or his counsel desired it, they could 
have been called and examined. 

But the counsel, after hearing the evidence for the pro- 
secution, adhered to his judgment noi to call witnesses, 
and the plaintifl&apos;did not insist upon it, but submitted to his 
counsel&apos;s judgment (&amp;). 

No witnesses, therefore, were called on his behalf, except 
as to character, and he was convicted. 

He did not, at the time, prefer any charge of perjury 
against either of the girls (c), nor any complaint against 
the defendants, but petitioned tlie Home Secretary for a 
remission of his sentence on the ground that the wit-

innocence (d).

CASES AT THE 



18G1. 




The Home Secretary declined to interfere, neither of the 
witnesses having been indicted for perjury (a). 

In April, 1860, the girl Eugenie was indicted for perjury, 
on assignments, on such of which, as went to the substance 
of the charges, she could only be directly contradicted by 
the plaintiff himself; and, on such as related to collateral 
circumstances, chiefly by himself or his wife(fc), partly 
confirmed by the other witnesses already alluded to. 

On this indictment (c) the girl, however, was con- 
victed (rf)- The plaintiff was then released, and, in No- 
vember, brought the present action. 

The case for the plaintiff now was, that in preparing for

V. Haydon, 1 W, Black. 404), pro- 
vided the conviction goes to the 
substance of the charge, and utterly 
destroys the evidence, for if it 
merely impeaches the credit of the 
witness, and the case otherwise ap- 
pears clear against the prisoner, 
there is no ground even for a stay 
of execution ; 7^ v. Oldroyd, R.&amp;R. C. C. 88. And so, even where 
a new trial is admissible, affidavit 
of new facts is not receivable ex- 
cept coupled with surprise; R. v.

Court will not in a civil case grant 
a new trial even on the ground of 
surprise, unless it is made manifest 
that the new evidence could not he

will remove all doubt ; Harlwright

his trial (the count as to the defence at the hearing before 1861. 
the magistrates not being [)ressed) the defendants had not 
examined the inmates of the house and laid their proofs 
before counsel, so as to enable counsel to form a proper 
judgment as to the propriety of calling them. And, to 
show that it would have been proper to call them, and that 
it was to be presumed that counsel would have so judged, 
liad their evidence been laid before him, they were now 
called and examined for the plaintifF as to the evidence 
they could and would have given at the trial. The plaintiff 
and his wife were examined as to the conduct of the de- 
fendants,&amp;c., but they could not have been examined at 
the original trial, and the other witnesses could and did 
only speak as to the garden charge, and as to the collateral 
point of the outer door of plaintiff&apos;s room being kept 
closed ; with the exception of Lucy Hatch, whose evidence, 
as taken at the trial of Eugenie Plummer, was by consent, 
on account of her tender years, read from the notes ; and 
who was in the plaintiff&apos;s bed-room in the mornings when 
Eugenie was in the plaintiff&apos;s bed. But, as regarded the 
substance of all the more serious charges, no witness was 
or could have been called to contradict the evidence of 
Eugenie, as the matters charged were repregented (o have 
occurred between the plaintiff and herself. 

To show that, if the witnesses had been called at the 
original trial, the result would have been an acquittal, 

Chambers proposed to call the jurymen who had tried 
the plaintiff on the original trial, and to ask them, having 
heard the evidence which had been now given as to what 
the witnesses could have stated, what verdict they would 
have returned had such evidence been given at the trial ? 
but. 

Pollock, C. B., after consulting the Judges, ruled that 
the jurymen could not be called for that purpose (a).

sBnl in the business of insurance, ticular facts would have enhanced 




476 CASES AT THE 

1861. Chambers then proposed to call eleven of the jury who 

had signed a memorial to the Home Secretary in favour of 
the plaintiff, and to ask them as to that memorial, and the 
giounds of it; or whether, if they had heard such evidence, 
they would have returned such a verdict; but, 

Pollock, C. B., refused to allow them to be called for 
any such purpose. 

Chambers proposed to call Sir G, Lewis, the Home Se- 
cretary, to prove the memorial presented to him for a 
remission of the sentence, and the ground on which he 
had refused to entertain it; and, 

Sir G. Lewis attended for the purpose of being exa- 
mined ; but, 

Pollock, C. B., having consulted the Judges, said they 
were of opinion that no such questions could be put, even 
assuming that the Home Secretary would not, as probably 
he would, object to answer on the ground of public 
policy (a). It could not affect this action. 

The clerk of Serjt. Ballantine was called, and proved 
that the Serjeant was retained on the 23rd November, that 
the brief was delivered on the 26th, and that there was a 
consultation on the 29th, two days before the trial, which 
was on the 1st December.

For the deFence, it was proved that the defendants saw 18GI 
the plaintiff more than once while he was in prison^ in 
order to confer with him as to his defence, and laid his own 
statement before counsel. 

&apos; One of the defendants, who had the conduct of the 
case, stated that, before the brief was delivered, he had a 
conference with Serjt. Ballantine at Westminster Hall, re- 
sulting in a resolution to call witnesses only as to character, 
and that the plaintiff said he &apos;&apos;must be guided by his 
counser* on that question. 

Various notes, from the plaintiff to his attorney during 
the course of his trial, were also put in, to show that he 
never insisted on witnesses being called, save as to cha- 
racter. 

Ballantine, Serjt., was called, and stated that he had 
been strongly of opinion that it would not be wise to call 
witnesses, and that he stated his reasons to the senior 
defendant, which he was ready to state now if the plaintiff 
waived the confidence of counsel ; but this 

Chambers^ on the part of the plaintiff, declined to do. 

Ballantine, Serjt., therefore, did not state his reasons (a). 
He stated, further, that he knew that the witnesses whose 
names were mentioned in the brief were in attendance, 
andh e also knew, substantially, all that they could prove. 
That he cross-examined the witnesses for the prosecution, 
and made up his mind finally and firmly in the course of 
the trial that it would not be wise to call witnesses. That, 
in this matter, he decided for himself, and exercised his 
own discretion, without reference to the defendants, deem- 
ing himself to be responsible. 

Pollock, C. B., said, in all cases counsel were respon- 
sible for the calling or not calling witnesses, having the 
conduct of the case in Court (J).

Pollock, C. B. (to the jury).— There can be no doubt 
that an attorney is liable to an action for any misconduct, 
or miscarriage/ which arises from his negligence. The 
present action h, so far as my knowledge goes, the very 
first that has ever been brought in a criminal case; and it 
raises questions of great gravity and difficulty (/). It re- 
quires, on that account, to be looked at with the more 
attention. 

Consider, first, the history of the case. Look at the 
mere dates and leading facts. The original charge was on 
the 8lh October, 1859. There was to be an inquiry before 
the visiting justices on the 28th October. On that day the 
plaintiff absconded, having first resigned his situation, so 
that the inquiry never took place. He remained away 
until a warrant was issued against him. 

The effect of this absconding was very strong, insomuch 
that within living memory it was a question to be tried on 
an indictment, whether the prisoner had &apos;&apos; fled from 
justice.**

480 CASES AT THE 

1861. Nextf there was the fact that the plaintifTs friends did 

not bail him, and he was therefore in prison until his trial. 
His trial was on the Ist December, 1869. The trial of 
Eugenie for perjury was in May, 1860. The first assign- 
ment of perjury was, that the alleged indecency in the 
garden had not taken place on the first day. In her 
original deposition she did not state that it had, but on 
cross-examination on the plaintiff&apos;s trial had been led to 
fix it on that day, a day on which several witnesses were 
able to give evidence to contradict her. That assignment 
went merely upon the precise time. The second was as to 
the hole in the plaintiff&apos;s pocket, as to which also witnesses 
could be called. But as to these charges it is to be borne 
in mind that the trial for perjury was in ilfay, 1860, as to 
matters occurring in August, 1859, not less than nine 
months before. The third assignment was, as to whether 
the outer door of plaintiff&apos;s bed-room was shut or fastened ; 
she swore it was, but not that it was always so ; and it may 
have been so at some particular time. As to these matters 
witnesses could be called in order to contradict her evidence. 
But as to the other, and all the more serious matters, 
involving the substance of the charges, it was not possible 
to call witnesses to contradict her, as they were alleged 
to have occurred when she and the plaintiff were by them, 
selves; and it seems strange that there should have been 
assignments of perjury on such matters. For instance, 
the fourth, as to the indecency in the bed-room on the 
night of the party. The fifth, as to what occurred in the 
bed-room on the second night The sixth, as to what was 
alleged to have occurred every night in the bed-room. 
The seventh, as to whether he was a quarter of an hour 
with her engaged as described. On all these and the 
other similar charges she could have been contradicted 
only by the plaintiff, who could not have been examined 
on his own trial. And it is strange that a child of eleven 
or twelve should have been indicted for perjury on such a 




SITl&apos;INGS- EXCHEQUER. 48 1 

matter as whether a man was engaged with her a quarter 18G1 
of an hour or ten minutes, a few minutes more or less ; or 
whether he hurt her. How could she have been contra- 
dicted on such a point as that? 

So as to other matters, too disgusting to mention, which, 
from their nature she alone could know of! And though 
on certain matters she was, on her trial, contradicted, it 
was mainly by the plaintiff and his wife, who could not 
have been examined on his trial; and the verdict on her trial 
having been general, on an indictment containing so many 
assignments of peijury, on roost of which it does not ap- 
pear that there could have been two witnesses to contradict 
her, nor anything but the oath of the plaintiff himself; it 
is impossible to tell on what assignments her conviction 
went. Therefore, for these reasons, it appears to me that 
her conviction has little bearing upon the present action. 
Neither is it material on the subject of the case, and es- 
pecially as to calling witnesses, and that he had communi- 
cated to the plaintiff the Serjeant&apos;s opinion, that it would be 
best not to call witnesses, for reasons which he also stated, 
to which the plaintiff replied, that he was sorry for it, as 
he should have desired to call witnesses, but that he must 
be guided by his counsel. 

A letter from the plaintiff to a friend was put in^ in 
which he said that the charge was one, it was so difficult 
to refute, that his escape depended on having a number 
of witnesses, whether on the evidence adduced on /ler trial, 
the plaintiff would have been acquitted, but whether on 
any evidence which could and might have been adduced 
on his trial, and was not adduced through the fault of the 
defendants^ it is probable that there would have been an 
acquittal. As to which it is important to observe, that 
the plaintiff himself does not appear to have had a very 
strong opinion, for having been convicted in December, 
1859, and released in May, 1860, he did not bring this 
action until November, 1860, about a year after his convic- 




482 CASES AT THE 

1861. tion, and five months after his release. Nor up to that time 
does it appear that he made any complaint of the conduct 
of the defendants. 

In the present action there is a twofold complatnti as 
to the healing before t)ie magistrates, and as to the trial. 
As to the first, I am of opinion that there is no ground for 
it, for that any one who saw the girl&apos;s depositions would 
say, as the senior defendant did say, that the &apos;^ case mast 
go for trial.&apos;&apos; And the defendants are not responsible for 
the plaintiflTs not being able to get bail. 

As to the second and chief complaint, with respect to the 
trial, it comes to this, that the defendants did not get np 
the case for the defence with sufiicient care and diligence, 
especially in examining the witnesses, so as to lay their 
proofs before counsel. 

The answer is, in efiect, that the plaintiff, by his own 
conduct, had placed himself in such a position, that any 
course was full of peril, and that everything was done which 
could be done, with any reasonable hope of doing good. 

You will have to consider, in substance, whether all was 
done which could have been done for any useful purpose, . 
and whether the not doing of anything which might have 
been done was the cause of the plaintiff&apos;s conviction. 

The declaration alleges, that by reason of the defendants&apos; 
negligence he was convicted. 

The charge divides itself into two parts : — First, the not 
calling witnesses at all. Secondly, the not examining the 
witnesses, so as to be in a position to instruct the counsel 
retained, and enable him to exercise a better judgment 
than he was able to do, as to the propriety of calling wit- 
nesses. But with regard to the first, the question of call- 
ing or not calling witnesses is entirely for counsel^ and the 
plaintifi^s counsel took the entire responsibility on him- 
self, and the plaintiff himself said, &quot;he must be guided 
by his counsel;&quot; he did not insist that his witnesses 
should be called) and his counsel at the time stated to 




SITTINGS— EXCHEQUER. 483 

him the reasons why he did not call them ; reasons in 1861. 
which he appeared to acquiesce, and which the counsel 
was ready to state on this trial. There were, it is easy 
to see, most grave and weighty reasons. Justice had 
been evaded ; the accused had absconded. When appre- 
hended, he had asked the officer what punishment could 
be awarded for such offences (the last question one can 
suppose an innocent ftian to ask) ; there was the evidence 
not of one girl only, but of two— and two of such tender 
age, that it is impossible to suppose they would have in- 
vented the dii»gu8ting circumstances to which they de- 
posed ; and though on some collateral points they might 
have been contradicted, on the main charge their testimony 
could not have been contradicted. Under such circum- 
stances it is not to be wondered at that Mr. Serjeant Bal- 
lantine advised his client not to call witnesses, who would 
have opened up a perilous cross-examination and given a 
reply ; nor is it to be wondered at that the plaintiff acqui- 
esced in that decision ; nor can he now complain of it. 

The charge against the defendants, however, resolves 
itself into this : that he did not make such inquiries as he 
might have done, nor make the best or mpst of the ma- 
terials for a defence at his disposal. Upon that the ques- 
tion for you is, whether the result of any further inquiries 
would have been to make it advisable to call Lucy Hatch 
and the other witnesses, except Mr. and Mrs. Hatch, who 
could not have been called. Upon that you must exercise 
your judgment on all the circumstances (a). 

It is to be observed, that the defendants had the wit- 

(cf) Where plaintiff&apos;s attorney rightly \e(t to the jury to determine 

suffered a cause to be called on for whether he had used reasonable 

trial, without baviug ascertained care in conducting the cause, and

attorney for negligence, it was 109. 




484 CASES AT THE 

18GI. nesses ia Court at the trial, ready to be called, so that had 
counsel determined to call them at the last moment, he 
could have done so. Mrs. Hatch states that the defend- 
ants did not examine Lucy Hatch, the principal of the wit- 
nesses, who might have been called, and yet she had been 
examined at the hearing. Mrs. Hatch says, she told the 
defendants that witnesses were in the house at the time, 
who could contradict all that was said against her hus- 
band ! But from the nature of the charges that was im- 
possible ; the main charges could not be contradicted, but 
only some of the details on collateral points, and then on 
such points the witnesses who might have been called 
might have contradicted each other, as two of them actually 
did on the trial for perjury. What counsel would have 
had to consider, therefore, even had the witnesses been 
examined by the defendants would have been, whether it 
was safe to hazard all for the sake of some collateral con- 
tradictions, leaving the whole substance of the charges un- 
contradicted. 

That is for you to consider. The great question is, 
whether the plaintiff&apos;s conviction was owing to the want 
of care and skill in the defendants, or was the result rather 
of his own conduct in placing himself in such a position. 

You must consider, also, the position in which the de- 
fendants found the case, when it was put into their hands. 
The plaintiff had absconded after resigning his situation ; 
and his wife put into their hands a copy of a letter she 
had written to the prosecutrix, imploring her not to press 
the charge. You must consider what effect at the outset 
these things roust have had upon their minds, as to the 
hopefulness of a defence. Nor was this all, the plaintiff 
admitted that the girl was accustomed to be in his bed in 
the morning while he was still in it, that was admitted; 
and it is impossible not to say that it was highly improper 
that a girl twelve years old should be in or on a man&apos;s bed 
while he and she were both undressed* All these matters 







SITTINGS— EXCHEQUER. 486 

had to be borne in mind| with regard to the hopefulness of ISCI 
a defence or the usefulness of calling witnesses to answer 
the charges. Above all, the plaintiff had absconded. 

That was a fatal step, and it had been taken some time 
before the defendants, were retained in the case. 

Even should you find for the plaintiff^ these things must 
all be considered with reference to the question of damages, 
for you must take into consideration how far the plaintiff 
himself contributed to the injury, if any, which he may 
have sustained, and how far his own conduct caused the 
mischief which is ascribed to the defendants&apos; negligence. 

The declaration alleges, that by reason of their negli- 
gence he was convicted. The plaintiff is not bound to 
prove that, in order to maintain his action. If the defend- 
ants&apos; negligence largely contributed to the result, they 
would be answerable for such damages as you might think 
just under all the circumstances. But if you think that 
either it would not have been wise to call witnesses, and 
that, under all the circumstances as they then appeared, it 
would have been useless or perilous to do so, then find for 
the defendants.

tion would equally have lain (sup- 
posing the facts had sustained it), 
although the defendants had not 
been retained, but liad volunteered, 
and that in neither case would it 
lie unless it were alleged and proved 
that the plaintiff was prejudiced by 
the alleged negligence, which in 
the present case was not otherwise 
alleged than by the averment that 
by reason of the negligence he was 
convicted. Hence that case con- 
firms those above cited, as show- 
ing that the averment was the gitt 
and gravamen of the declaration. 
If the plaintiff had been acquitted, 
it is not easy to see what damage 
there could have been. 

(a) In T. T., Chamben moved 
on the grounds of rejection of evi- 
dence and misdirection as to da** 
mages, but the Coort, upon con* 
sideration, refused the rule. It did 
not become necessary, therefore, to 
enter into the grave and serious 
questions which would have arisen 
had the plaintiff recovered substan- 
tial damages, and had the defend&quot; 
ants moved for misdirection, on the 
ground that no such action would 
lie, in a criminal case, where the 
accused had his witnesses in Court, 
acquiesced in the decision of coun* 



sel not to call them (a decision 
founded on hiiown statement of the 
case, and of their evidence), ami, 
finally, sued, without alleging bit 
innocence of the offence of which 
he had been convicted. Had he 
averred his innocence, then siip- 
podng the allegation to have been 
material (as, it is submitted, it 
would have been), it might have 
been traversed, and both the girls 
might have been examined, as well 
as the plaintiff and his wife, and 
the jury would at least have had a 
far fairer opportunity of judging of 
the matter than the jury who con- 
victed Engenie of peijoiy. And it 
is conceived that the omission of 
the averment was fatal, because on 
grounds of public policy it would 
be dangerous to allow a gu&apos;Uiy per- 
son, duly convicted^ to sue any one 
cither for malice in the prosecu- 
tion or negligence in his defence. 
He cannot sue for malice, and it 
seems a strange ground of action 
for a guilty man, that, by some 
Industry in dealing with witnesses, 
or taking legal objections, be might 
have escaped conviction, and thus 
defeated justice. Beyond all doubt 
a guilty man may be convicted 
through negligence, and, perhaps, 
to hold such an action to lie would 
be to open a very wide door.

were cited in the Divorce Court. In December, 1857, she 
had gone into furnished lodgings, and warehoused her 
furniture, payrag the warehouse rent. In August, 1859,

chased the goods were called to prove that she had bought 
them with her own money, or on her own credit, and, as 
to some of the articles, after the decree nisi. 

Chambers cross-examined the plaintiff to show that the 
goods were really Grover&apos;s ; and contended, at the close of 
the plaintiff&apos;s case (calling no witnesses to contradict her), 
that the form of the issue threw the affirmative on her, 
and that she had failed to sustain it, her marriage being 
admitted, and not being dissolved; that the execution 
creditor could set up her husband s right, and that he was 
the owner of the goods (if Grover was not), although he 
had done nothing to reduce them into possession, citing 
Gadsden v. Barrow (a).

Originally several actions were brought by the plaintiflT 
against the captains of the ships or the cotton brokers or 
warehousemen, in whose hands the cargoes had been 
placed ; but these actions were consolidated by an order 
made by consent, the parties to the other actions abiding 
theresulton each of the separate counts in trover respectively. 

The defendants had obtained delivery of all the cargoes 
except one, which had been stopped in the docks at Liver- 
pool, and which would await the result of the verdict in 
the present case. 

The action had been commenced in January, 1860, but had 
been delayed by commissions to examine witnesses abroad, 
and there was hardly any oral evidence in the case, except 
that of the plaintiff and DeVisser, the agent for defendants 
in the transactions in question. 

The defendants were merchants and commission agents 
in London and Liverpool, engaged in the cotton trade, and 
De Visser acted as their agent in America. The plaintiff 
was a cotton buyer, who had been engaged to buy cottons 
for Maconochie and Co., in the Southern States: and 
whose course of business had been to buy in his own name, 
draw bills on Maconochie and Co. for the price, and dis- 
count them with the bankers at New Orleans or elsewhere, 
wherever the cotton might be purchased, and with the pro- 
ceeds he would pay for the cottons. The bills would pass 
through the hands of the bankers to Maconochie and Co., 
who would accept and ultimately pay them. The cotton 
would meanwhile be shipped, and the bills of lading signed, 
deliverable to the order of the plaintiff, who would then in- 
dorse the bills of lading to Maconochie and Co., at New 
York ; the intention being that they should send the cotton 
to the defendants, who should sell the cotton under their 
orders. 

Maconochie and Co. would, when the bills of lading 
arrived at New York, draw bills on the defendants for the 
value, and would discount the bills so drawn in New York 



SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



495 



in order to raise funds for the payment of the bills so 
drawn on them for the price of the cotton, and then they 
would indorse the bills of lading to the defendants. 

In July, 1858, De Visser, being the agent of the defend- 
ants, with full power to represent them, and that being the 
second season for buying cotton since the arrangement had 
been entered into between the houses, there were bills to a 
considerable amount coming due on Maconochie and Co., 
which they were not prepared in funds to meet. De Visser 
then arranged with them to advance them funds for the pur- 
pose : and an arrangement was then entered into between 
him and the plaintiff as to the buying and shipping of 
cotton for the defendants, on which the present action was 
brought 

The plaintiff and De Visser who were both called 
differed entirely in their versions of the conversation which 
then took place between them, and in which the arrange- 
ment was entered into. The effect of it, according to the 
plaintifTs account, was that De Visser, on behalf of the 
defendants, gave the guarantie declared on, that they would 
see that funds were provided to meet the bills drawn on 
Maconochie and Co., for the cotton to be bought by the 
plaintiff at New Orleans and elsewhere, in his own name, 
to be shipped to Maconochie and Co., and by them con- 
signed to the defendants. It was admitted that, whatever 
the arrangement might be, De Visser acted in making it as 
the agent of the defendants, and was their agent for the pur- 
pose of making it. It was also admitted that the plaintiff, 
who purchased in his own name, was in the position of 
vendor, and had the rights of a vendor, including that of 
stoppage in transitu (a). 

The plaintiff stated that De Visser told him the arrange- 
ment by which he was to advance Maconochie and Co. 
money, and that they had a letter of credit for 10,000/.,

which they have never used, and which is still available. 
And that he, the plaintiff, then said to De Visser ** you 
must see that when Maconochie and Co. sell the cotton 
and send it forward&quot; ( to the defendants), ** they apply the 
money in taking up my drafls on them against the cotton ;** 
and that De Visser said, ^* I will see that your bills are 
paid.&quot; This latter part De Visser denied, admitting the 
former. It was not denied that Maconochie and Co. had 
been furnished with sufficient funds to meet the bills drawn 
by the plaintiff, for the cotton shipped to them, and by 
them consigned to the defendants, under the arrangement 
thus entered into between the plaintiff and De Visser. But 
Maconochie and Co. having failed after the cottons were 
shipped to the defendants, the bills drawn by the plaintiff 
bad not been met. The plaintiff came to this country, and 
gave notice to the captains of the ships, as they arrived^ to 
stop the cargoes, and the present action, brought nominally 
by him, but really by the original sellers of the cotton, under 
their indemnity, was brought to recover the value or pro- 
ceeds. The defendants having sold the cargoes after such 
notices from the plaintiff as above mentioned, which, it was 
admitted, was in time to operate as a stoppage in transilUf 
supposing he had a right to stop as against the defendants ; 
and on the part of the plaintiff it was contended that he 
was entitled to recover, either on that right, or on the 
guarantie. On the part of the defendants the guarantie 
was denied, and the right to stop disputed ; the defendants 
having taken the bills of lading bond fide and for full value. 
The case for the defendants was that De Visser only 
undertook to make advances on the bills of lading accord- 
ing to the usual course of business; and that he had done 
so to the full value of the whole : and that though 
Maconochie and Co. had not applied the advances to the 
payment of the bills drawn for the cotton, De Visser was 
no party to this misconduct on their part, and that the bills 
of lading were indorsed to the defendants bondjide, without 



SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



497 



notice of the inBolvency of Maconochie. It was not denied 
that the advances to the full amount had been made, but it 
was suggested that on the 22nd of November, 1858, when 
the bills of lading were indorsed to defendants, their agent 
had notice that on the day before one of the bills drawn on 
Maconochie and Co. had been dishonored ; and that De 
Visser all along was aware of their condition, and knew 
that the funds he supplied would not be appropriated to 
the payment of the bills for the cotton. De Visser swore 
that the advances were made in August, September, and 
October, to an amount exceeding the value of the cotton, 
and that he did not know to what purpose Maconochie had 
applied the advances. 

Maconochie having been examined by commission stated, 
that at or about the time the bills of lading were handed to De 
Visser, he told him that the cottons were not all paid for. 

As regards the last two of the cargoes in particular, the 
plaintiff contended that there was evidence from the cir- 
cumstances that the defendants* agent, when he took the 
bills of lading, knew that the bills drawn in respect 
thereof would not be met, and were in fact dishonored. 

At the close of the case Bovill abandoned the third 
count, (founded on misrepresentation,) as both parties it 
appeared knew the state of Maconochie and Co. equally 
well at the time of the transaction. 

CocKBURN, C. J., pointed out, that the count on the 
guarantie and the counts in trover, founded on the supposed 
right to stop in transitu, were distinct and independent 
grounds of action. 

Bovill admitted that this was so, but contended that 
if the guarantie, as alleged, was sustained, as it was not 
pretended that it had been carried out, the defendants 
could not set up the bills of lading. And that if the ad- 
vances were not bond Jide, the plaintiff was entitled to 
recover on that ground, dishonored bills not preventing 
stoppage in transitu (a).

Keane, contrk.— I was counsel in that cause for the 
defendant. The report in 1 Post&amp;Pin. conveys an in- 
accurate impression. What really occurred was this. The 
cause came on last at the assizes, and Mr. O&apos;Malley, who 
led for the crown, suggested to me that as I had sufficiently 
opened the nature of the defendant&apos;s case by the line of 
cross-examination I had adopted, I should not: make a 
speech to the jury in opening my case. To this I objected, 
on the ground that it was a criminal and not a civil case, 
and that I had no right to sum up ; and therefore if I

SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



499 



adopted his suggestion, I should lose my right to make a 
speech at all. 

The Lord Chief Baron, who was trying the cause, 
then made an observation to somewhat of the purport of 
his reported remarks (a), and gave me leave if I chose to 



1861. 




(a) The case of Regina v. Broke 
occurred in 1859 ; and if there were 
any difference between Reane&apos;s 
statement of it and the report 
furnished by counsel fronn notes 
taken at the time, the latter would 
perhaps be more likely to be correct 
But in truth there is no difference. 
The learned reporter states, in sub- 
stance, what Reane states as above, 
that &quot; at the close of the case for 
the prosecution, Reane for the de- 
fendant asked tbe Chief Baron if 
he should be allowed to sum up 
the evidence as in a civil cause&quot; 
(the words of the section of the C. 
L.P. Act, 1854, s. 18, being, *&lt;that 
upon the trial of any cavxt!^&amp;c.), 
and Reane states that the Chief 
Baron did say something to the 
effect reported, viz.,&lt;* This is in 
reality a cause, and the defendant 
ought to have the same rights as in 
a civil action.&quot; The report states 
the result of the case exactly as 
Reane states it, and merely gives 
the opinion of the Lord Chief Baron 
upon the point; in which, perhaps, 
there may be more difficulty, when 
it comes to be discussed, than 
appears to have been supposed. 
Beyond all doubt, in the more 
ancient writers the word &quot; cause,&quot; 
or &quot; action,&quot; included criminal as 
well as civil suits (vide Bracton, 
lib. iii. c. 1), and a very large 
meaning has been given to the 
word in statutes relating to pro- 
cedure. 



Hale, in his &quot; Pleas of the Crown/&apos; 
always speaks of indictments as 
*&apos; criminal cau»e$*\vo\, 2, p. 160). 
And in the Index there is this 
passage, under the he%d of Certio- 
rari : &apos;&apos; Criminal cataet not capital, 
as indictments for riots, may be 
removed into B. R. by certio- 
rari,&quot;&amp;c. No doubt, action and 
indictment are different remedies 
(Johnson v. Clay, 1 B.&amp;P. 
191), but so are different actions^ 
as replevin and trespass, the one 
being a specific remedy, the other 
only conpensatory. And an in- 
dictment for non-repair really 
comes to a specific remedy to 
enforce the repair, judgment being 
commonly respited until, or dis- 
charged upon, repair: or a nominal 
fine imposed on a plea of guilty 
(Reg. V. Ijuughto% 3 Smith, 575 ; 
Reg. V. Lutcombe, 2 Chitt 214). 
The Court will not entertain an 
application for setting aside an 
award founded on an indictment 
at the assizes for not repairing a 
road, though the question in dis- 
pute be of a civil nature (Reg. v. 
Cotetbach, 2 D.&amp;R. 265). But 
this implies no more than that, 
technically, it is not a civil cause, 
and does not show that, especially 
when in a civil court, it is not a caute. 

On the other hand, in indict- 
ments for misdemeanors in cases of 
private prosecutions, when both the 
defendant and the prosecutor have 
brought down their records and 



600 



CASES AT THE

reserve my remarks to the jury until after the examination 
of the clefendant*s witnesses. I found I could not safel j 
call some of them without opening their evidence to the 
jury, which I did very briefly ; but in the course of their 
examination the defence broke down, and the defendant 
yielded to a verdict against him. The right to sum ap 
was never asserted by me or in contest in the cause. 

CocKBUBN, C. J. — This is on the crown side of the Court, 
and the practice has been uniform. No such right as 
that contended for exists, nor did I ever know it either 



entered them with the marshal, 
and the defendant&apos;s name stood 
first, and the prosecutor&apos;s lowest in 
the list, it was held that the trial 
must be taken according to the 
order of entry in the marshal&apos;s list 
(Reg, V. Halie, 1 R.&amp;M. 20). 
This seems to illustrate a general 
principle that when a cause, civil 
or criminal, is removed by certiorari 
into a superior Court for trial, the 
procedure at the trial is the proce- 
dure of thai Court. The Court of 
NUi Print is as distinct a Court 
from that of gaol delivery as either 
of them is from the Queen&apos;s Bench. 

In the very decision on which it 
was held *&apos; that the 4&amp;5 Anne, 
c. 16, s. 8, does not apply to 
criminal cautetf*&apos; it is implied that 
they are cautet {Anon. 1 Burr. 252). 
And the words used in that enact- 
ment in actions brought in any of 
Her Majesty&apos;s Courto at West- 
minster, which could not possibly 
include indictments removed into 
one of those Courts by certiorari. 

A similar remark applies to the 
decisions that the statute 4 Anne, 
c. 16, allowing double pleading, 
does not apply to qui tarn actions, 
nor ** to actiont at the suit of the 
king&apos;* {Lord v. Crowther, 2 Wils. 



21 ; Reg. v. Caldwell^ Forrest, 57), 
and the terms used in the latter cass 
rather imply that indictments for 
misdemeanors are actions, though 
the word &quot;suit&quot; or &quot;cause&quot; is 
larger than the word ** action.&quot; 
Accordingly, in ^ the words&lt;* action 
or suit&quot; it was held that defendant 
in auditd querela might plead several 
pleas {Giles v. Uutt, 18 L. J.,

consider whether the plaintiff in this case removed the

The plaintiff and the defendants were shipbrokers in 
London. 

On the 13th December, 1856, the plaintiff agreed with 
the defendants to charter the ship by a charter in the usual 
printed form used by the plaintiff, with his name printed 
upon it in the usual way; and in the margin was a printed 
clause in these terms : — 

&apos;^ A commission of five per cent, on this charter to be 
paid to Hibbert and Co., to whom the vessel is (to be) 
addressed on her return to London.&quot; 

In the body of the charter was this clause :— &quot; The ves- 
sel is to be consigned to charterer&apos;s agents at the port of 
discharge.&quot; 

The charter was for the outward voyage only, for a 
lump sum of 2,700/. The parties had agreed to divide the 
commission, the defendants to have three-fifths of it. 

The ship was duly loaded and the stipulated freight duly

paid. She sailed from London to Port Pliillip, and having 
there discharged, sailed to Callao, and there loaded a cargo 
of guano wherewith she sailed to Falmouth for orders^ and 
was ultimately ordered to discharge in London. 

It appeared to have been known to the plaintiff before and 
at the time of the charter, that the defendants intended to 
send the ship to Callao or some port for a homeward cargo. 

When the plaintiff saw that the ship had arrived at 
Falmouth, he saw one of the dePendants, and as the plain- 
tiff stated, was assnred that the charter would be carried 
out by the ship&apos;s crews addressed to him if she came to 
London. A few days afterwards the plaintiff was told by 
one of the defendants that the ship was coming to London, 
and thereupon, as he stated, said to him, &apos;&apos; Of course you 
will give the captain directions to bring his papers to me, 
so that we can enter the ship inwards, as per charter-party?&quot; 
To which the defendant replied, &quot; Of course not, we are 
brokers ourselves ; and we can act ourselves ; I don&apos;t re- 
member that it is in the charter, but if it is, we will pay 
you the usual reporting fee.&quot; 

Thereupon, on the 1st April, 1868, the plaintiff addressed 
to the captain a letter in these terms : — 

*^ In accordance with the terms of your charter-party 
we have to request that you will, as early as possible, 
forward to us the news and any papers for entering your 
vessel and transacting the usual business of the ship.&quot; And 
likewise wrote to the defendants thus : — 

*&apos; We give you notice that we shall expect the terms of 
the charter-party to be adhered to, and request that you 
will direct the captain to bring the papers necessary for 
the transaction of the ship&apos;s business on to this office, on 
his making his appearance in London. The defendants, 
however, reported and cleared the ship themselves; and 
the plaintiff sent to the captain and the defendants a 
claim to the same effect and Amount, as in his present 
particulars of demand ; estimating the value of the

homeward freight at 6^500/. at two and a half per cent, 
167i 15*. 

The case for the plaiotiff was, that the clause indorsed 
on the margin of the charter meant that the charterer should 
not only report the ship, but do the ordinary business 
of the homeward cargo, ». e.^ make out the freight notes 
and collect the freight ; and that for doing this he was 
entitled, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, 
to brokerage, or ** address commissioB,&quot; at the rate of two 
and a half per cent on the amount of the freight 

On the part of the defendants, it was denied that this 
was the meaning of the memorandum; or that, even if it 
were so, it applied in the present case, the ship not having 
in fact returned from the port in Australia, but from a port 
in another country. 

The cause was originally tried before Cbowoeb, J., when 
the plaintiff called witnesses to show that the memorandum 
was usual, and how he ascribed to it ; and the defendant 
called witnesses to show that it was not acted upon when 
a return voyage was not mentioned in the charter, and the 
learned Judge left it to the jury whether it was part of the 
contract; and, if so, what were the damages. They found for 
the plaintiff, damages 1512. But this verdict was set aside 
on a rule, the grounds of which were, that the memoran- 
dum was no part of the contract; or that it was not 
applicable, the charter being only for an outward voyage ; 
or that, if applicable, the plaintiff would only be entitled to 
commission on 2,700/. (the amount to be paid by the 
charter for the outward voyage); that evidence to alter 
or explain the memorandum was not admissible, that the 
clause as to division of commission applied to the home- 
ward cargo, and that the verdict was against the evidence. 

The rule was to enter the verdict for the defendant, 
or a nonsuit, or to reduce the -damages, or for a new 
trial; and the Court made it absolute for a new trial on 
the ground that there was not si|flScient evidence to

CASES AT THE

tween the parties. Such evidence, therefore, was deemed 
not only admissible.but essential. On the present occasion 
ancuTiTother. ^^^ plaintiff stated that he had chartered in this case as 
principal, and that the defendant knew him as such, and 
that at the time of the charter he had heard from them 
that they were going to &quot; fix *&apos; the ship for a homeward 
cargo from Callao. That the terms were matter of dis- 
cussion at the time. Thatihe defendants asked for a di- 
vision of commission, but that the plaintiff said he roust 
insist on all the terms and clauses of his printed charter in- 
tact, but ultimatety he gave way, so far as to allow the 
defendants three-fiflhs of the commission on the outward 
cargo, but not for the homeward. 

On cross-examination the plaintiff stated that be never 
chartered for others, but that most brokers had a clause of 
this kind either in the margiR or in the charter. He admitted 
that, in the course of the discussions on the charter, nothing 
was said about ** address commission ;&quot; but also said that 
when not intended to be applied to the homeward cargo it 
was struck out. 

There were witnesses called for the plaintiff, who stated 
that the vessel being &quot; addressed&apos;* meant that it should be 
consigned to a certain party, who should transact all the 
business and collect the freight, for which he would be 
entitled to charge, by way of commission, on the gross 
freight. That the clause was common in the Austra- 
lian trade, and that in that trade it was common for ships 
chartered to Australia to return with guano from Callao. 
That the clause was common, and that it was common 
to have the ship addressed to a particular firm of brokers. 
And that, when the clause was retained, they had niever 
known the payment of two and a half per cent, commission 
on the homeward cargo to the broker, to whom the ship 
was addressed, objected to. 

In the course of the case, the jury intimated that they 



HiBBERT 



SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 607 

were clear that the memorandum was meant to be, and 1859. 
was part of, the contract between the parties. 

That point was not^ therefore, further controverted, and v, 

the case then turned upon the meaning of the memoran* ^^ Another, 
dum, as to which 

JBovill called witnesses to show that, according to 
usage, the word ** addressed &quot; merely meant that the 
broker should have a reporting fee, not collect the freight ; 
but some of them admitted that when the clause was re- 
tained, they had collected the freight, and that, if a ship 
was addressed to them, they should expect to collect the 
freight. And they admitted that the effect of the clause 
had been disputed. 

CoGKBUBN, C. J. (to the jury). — The question is as to 
the meaning of the memorandum in mercantile usage. 
Even if the defendants are correct in contending that 
it merely means that the ship shall be reported by the 
broker to whom she is addressed, as nothing has been 
paid or tendered, there has been a breach of contract, 
unless, by mercantile usage, the clause becomes in- 
operative as soon as a homeward charter is obtained. 

It has not been disputed that the clause would have 
applied had not the defendants happened to be owners 
who desired to collect their own freight. 

It is clear that the memorandum has been deemed of 
importance; for it is admitted that it has been combated 
and disputed, and sometimes struck out. This shows 
that it must have some meaning and operation. And the 
question is, what effect it has. 

To find for the plaintiff, you must be satisfied that its 
definite and known meaning is what he contends it is. 
If you think it was so understood, find for the plaintiff. 
If you are not satisfied of that, find for the defendants. 

There is some evidence that it does not apply to a 
homeward voyage.

and concerning the plaintiff as such calendarer, setting ig^i^ 
out a letter, written by the defendanti Secretary of the 
Protestant Alliance, to the Daily iVini;«, January 19, 1861, 
containing the following passages: — &quot;The ground on 
which the Protestant Alliance object to the employment of 
Mr. Turnbull to collate papers relating to the period of 
religious antagonism of the highest importance, was based 
upon the antecedents of Mr. T.and his remarkably strong and 
natural bias to the Jesuits, and his equally intense hatred 
to the Protestants. In proof of this statement I quote the 
following from our memorial, every word of which I am 
prepared to prove, as I made the extracts myself from 
Mr. T.&apos;s works : &apos; That Mr. Turnbull is not only a Roman 
Catholic, but an avowed defender and admirer of the 
Jesuits, for whom he expresses a natural bias, and holds 
them in the highest veneration, honour, and esteem ; and 
has in that work manifested this natural bias, calling the 
Jesuit priest Garnet, who was implicated in the Gunpowder 
Plot, a well-known martyr, and the conspiracy of Ba- 
bington against the life of Elizabeth and the State of 
England, a &apos;gallant confederacy.&apos; That in another 
work he designated the Reformation a mischievous event; 
and has declared that he would ratlier be condemned with 
a Papist than saved with a Puritan.&apos; The validity of our 
objections will, I apprehend, be admitted by most persons, 
after reading the foregoing extract. But when the deputa* 
tion waited on Lord Palmerston, his lordship received a 
letter from Sir John Romilly, justifying the appointment, 
in which he stated that he (Sir J. Romilly) had appointed 
Protestant gentlemen since the agitation on the subject, to 
examine and compare the papers prepared by Mr. Turn* 
bull, and to see that he had done his work fairly; and 
also another gentleman was appointed to examine the state 
of the original documents, on their being given to Mr. T., 
and on their being returned by him, to examine and see

1861. that they were whole and unmutilated, and to certify to that 
efiect. I write from memory, but I know that I have given 
the true effect of the letter. If Mr. Turnbull is perfectly 
qualified for his office, and his integrity be unimpeachable, 
what need of three gentlemen to watch him, and to put the 
country to the expense of employing four persons to do the 
work of one. The Protestant Alliance has not thrown out 
insinuations against the honesty and capability of Mr. 
Turnbull ; but they put forth clear proofs that he is not, 
from his peculiar opinions, a fit and proper person for such 
an office,&apos;&apos;&amp;c. 

Meaning that the plaintiff was such a bigoted and 
prejudiced Roman Catholic, and had such an intense 
hatred of Protestants, and a strong bias towards Jesuits, 
that, by reason thereof, he could not be trusted with the 
said State papers, that his integrity was impeachable, and 
that be would mutilate and deface, alter, or destroy, or 
was capable of so acting, or likely^to so act, and that Sir 
J. Romilly had considered it necessary to watch him, in 
order to prevent his so doing. 

The second count set forth another letter from the 
defendant to the same paper, stating that the Foreign 
State Papers contained many relating to the history of the | 

Reformation, or events connected therewith : and &apos;&apos;that | 

such papers are of the highest importance, and ought not to 
be placed in jeopardy. Their custody ought to be perfectly 
safe. The Protestant Alliance, and those who signed the 
memorial, entertain upon good grounds grave doubts as to 
their securityy as the following facts will show. On the 
presentation of the memorial a gentleman of the highest 
station stated, that when he spoke to a person of distin- 
guished literary merits on the appointment of Mr. Turn- 
bull, he thought at first that there was no danger to our 
national records : but, on making careful examination into 
the matter, he expressed himself satisfied that there was 
real ground for apprehension. Still further to show the

danger to our records^ in Mendham&apos;s Literary History 1861. 
it is stated that^ from a work in the Bodleian Library 
(Gesner&apos;s Bibliotheca), pages containing an account 
of Luther and others, with their works, have been cut 
away, and the lower part of the last of these pages 
so dexterously united, that the very catch word answers, 
and only the thickness of the pasted portion betrays the 
abstraction. The articles of Philip Melancthon, Martin

of the controversy respecting their criminal implication in 
the Gunpowder plot, had depended upon the fair effect of 
the original documents now to be Found in the State Paper 
Office, impartial readers might probably hesitate to form 
a decided opinion against them. It is a singular accident, 
that among so large a mass of documents, precisely those 
should be abstracted upon whose authenticity the questioa 
so hotly disputed between Catholics and Protestants mainly 
depended.&quot; It is indeed a singular accident that such 
papers should be abstracted ; and probably a similar acci- 
dent happened to the papers in the eventful reign of Queen 
Mary, so that the name of that archslayer of Protestants* 
Bishop Bonner, is not to be found among them (a). Pro- 
bably some one of those worthy Jesuits whom Mr. Turn- 
bull holds in such honour, esteem, and veneration, accident- 
ally burnt them, especially if he had a separate room and 
a large freijb). Even Sir J. Romilly has a hand list kept 



lome from the Harleian MSS in 
the British Museum, and others 
from the State Paper Office. 

(a) The onl)r documents in which 
his name would be found in con- 
nection with those events, are the 
commissions issued to him, in com- 
mon with other persons, clerical 
and la)r, from the Queen&apos;s Council, 
directing them to execute the laws. 
See Maitland&apos;s Hist, of the Ret 
See also the learned work of Mr. 
Foss, &quot; Livet vf the Judges&quot; in 
which there is frequent mention 
made of these commissions : which 
were issued not merely to prelates 
but laymen, and obeyed by the 
latter with just as much zeal as 
the former : and were issued by a 
council composed almost entirely 
of laymen, and comprising many 
of those who were in office 
under £dward, and in office or in 



fiirour under Elizabeth, and unscru- 
pulous men who cared for wither 
religion and professed either. See 
the Lives of Cholmley, Rich, 
Paulet,&amp;c. Mr. Hallam says, 
*&apos; The Privy Council were con- 
tinually urging the bishops forward 
in this persecution, though the 
latter bore the chief blame &quot; (Const. 
Hist. Eng. vol. 1 , p. 105). Hence 
it is clear that any one of the 
plaintifl*&apos;s opinions could only desire 
to preserve the official documents 
relative to this painful subject.

came to the hands of the plaintiiF as such calendarer were

lated and destroyed by the plaintiff, and that he was such 
a false, treacherous, and untrustworthy Jesuit in spirit,

cutting and tearing and making away with such papers,&amp;c.

The plaintiff and defendant were both barristers and

The plaintiff was a Roman Catholic, whose past works

The defendant was Secretary of the Protestant Alliance. 

In September, 1859, Sir J. Romilly, the Master of the

calendarer of the foreign papers in the State Paper Office,

documents which were delivered to him for that purpose. 

In May, 1860, the defendant, as Secretary of the Pro- 
testant Alliance, circulated a memorial to the Prime 
Minister against this appointment, which received numerous 
signatures, and which is cited in the first libel. 

In July, 1860, a deputation waited on the Prime Minister 
to enforce the memorial, when he read a letter from Sir J. 
Romilly, vindicatin the nomination of the plaintiflP. The 
defendant was present with this deputation and heard the 
letter read, which was the letter he alluded to in the 
letter of his, now complained of as the libel in the first 
count; and of which he stated from recollection, that the 
purport was, that the Master of the Rolls had appointed 
two Protestant gentlemen to examine and compare the 
papers prepared by the plaintiff, to show that he had done 
his work fairly; and that another gentleman was appointed 
to examine the state of the original documents,&amp;c. 

The passages in the letter of the Master of the Rolls to 
which the defendant had thus referred were as follows :— 

&quot; So far as I am acquainted with the documents they 
held out no temptation to make a false calendar, they con- 
sist principally of letters to and from ambassadors in foreign 
Courts, and deal little with religion. The documents which 
relate to religion are domestic papers which are confided to 
other gentlemen.&quot; 

&quot; However, since the matter has been agitated, I have 
requested two very competent Protestants, members of the 
Record Department, to inspect the papers intended to be 
calendared by Mr. Turnbull, and to make a report to me 
upon them ; and if I find that any of them have a religious 
tendency, I will take care, that every calendar of these 
papers shall be tested with the original documents by a 
gentleman without any Roman Catholic tendencies.&quot; 

After the deputation, at which the letter was read in the 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 615 

derendant&apos;g presence, the Alliance, and the defendant as 1861 
their secretary, continued to urge, through various channels, 
the necessity of a removal of the plaintiff from bis office. 

In the month of January, 1861, the Alliance published 
in the Daily News and other papers their annual address, 
making allusion to the appointment of the plaintiff, and 
their exertions against it as obnoxious. 

On the 16th January, the plaintiff addressed to the Daily 
News a letter to the effect that &apos;&apos; as the Alliance had thrown 
out insinuations against his honesty and capability as a 
calendarer of State papers, he requested them to send some 
persons to examine his work with the documents them- 
selves.&apos;* 

In answer to this, on the 19th January, the defendant 
published in the Daily News the letter which contained 
the libel complained of in the first count. 

On the 22nd January the plaintiff published in the 
same paper an answer, in which he charged the de- 
fendant with a misstatement of the letter of the Master 
of the Rolls. It turned out that the defendant&apos;s re- 
collection of the letter, which he had only heard 
ready was inaccurate ; and that what the Master of the 
Rolls had really written was to the effect, that, in conse- 
quence of the outcry made against the plaintiff&apos;s appoint- 
ment, he had desired two Protestant gentlemen to see how 
the work had been done. There was no reason to suppose 
that the defendant had in this respect made a wilful mis- 
statement, and he denied it upon his oath. 

The plaintiff however, in replying to this first letter of 
the defendant in the same newspaper, charged the defend- 
ant with stating as &apos;&apos; a positive fact of his own knowledge &quot; 
that three gentlemen were set to watch him,&amp;c., whereas, 
it will be observed, the defendant, so far from stating it as 
of his own knowledge, professed to quote a letter of the 
Master of the Rolls, and to quote it only from memory. 
The plaintiff in his reply went on thus : — *&apos; I challenge him 




616 CASES AT THE 

1S6I. to prove that statement. I charge him, in making it, of 
being guilty of deliberate falsehood/* and then went on to 
accuse the defendant of various misstatements. 

The defendant replied by a letter of January 22ndy in 
which he retorted these accusations, and pointed out what 
he deemed inaccuracies in the plaintiffs statements, show- 
ing his unfitness for the office of analysing and epitomising 
documents. 

On the 24th January the defendant published (in answer 
to a letter of the Rev, Mr. Brewer, in defence of the plaintiff, 
which stated that &quot; a hand list was kept of all documents 
given out to the plaintiff, so that any loss or mutilation 
would be instantly detected/*) another letter, containing the 
libel complained of in the second count, and the passage 
chiefly complained of, alluding to documents as being 
burnt, &quot; especially if he had a separate room and a large 
fire.&quot; 

On the 28th January, four days afler that letter, the 
plaintiff resigned his appointment. 

On the 29th January the resignation was accepted, and 
in February this action was brought. 

The plaintiff being examined as to the nature of his 
duties^ stated that they related entirely to Foreign State 
Papers, the domestic series having been entrusted to other 
persons, tmd nearly completed ; and that they related only 
indirectly, casually, and collaterally to the events of the 
Reformation, and rather to its political than its religious 
aspects (a). 

He performed his duties in the office, at which were en- 
gaged Mr. Hardy and Mr. Brewer, and in a separate room, 
which in winter had a fire; Mr. Brewer being engaged in 
the adjoining room. 

No restrictions were imposed on him which were not

duties (a). ^-^^^^^ 

TURNBULL 

The plaintiff stated, that had the controversy related only o. 

to his fitness or competence for the office on general 
grounds, he should not have resigned ; but that when he 
found it imputed to him that he was capable of acting 
in a felonious manner, by abstracting or mutilating docu- 
ments entrusted to him, he felt it necessary to throw up 
his appointment. 

The plaintiff said he had not seen the letter of the 
Master of the Rolls. 

Having stated that he had instructed a member of par- 
liament to bring forward his case in parliament, and seen 
the reports of the discussions, he was, on cross-examina- 
tion, asked divers questions upon statements reported as 
made by that member on the matter. 

The Rev. Mr. Brewer and Mr. Hardy were called on the 
part of the plaintiff, and confirmed his evidence as to the 
nature of his duties, and stated that the rules applicable 
to the use of the papers,&amp;c. were applied alike to all 
persons engaged upon them, and that there were none 
specially applied to the plaintiff. 

They stated that, in their opinion, there were no docu- 
ments of a controversial character among those with which 
the plaintiff had to deal, and that he had done his duties 
faithfully and fairly. 

Mr. Hardy stated that, on the 14th of February (some 
weeks after the libels complained of and about a week be- 
fore action), the defendant called upon him at the office for 
the first time, and desired to borrow the volume which the 
plaintiff had recently published, and which he did not 
appear to have seen. The defendant on that occasion, 
however, stated that he had no complaint to make of the

to him on general grounds, on account of the strong 
opinions he had avowed as to his admiration for the Jesuits 
and the like. Being asked as to a certain statement 
put forth by Lord Shaftesbury as to the plaintiff being 
employed to deal with documents relating to the Reforma- 
tion, and to write the history of the Reformation, he 
declared that he had never asserted so much, and that 
a statement to that effect in one of the recent reports 
of the Protestant Alliance was an oversight (a). The 
witness explained to him the nature of the papers with 
which the plaintiff had to deal, and of his duties in regard 
thereto. 

Divers passages from the plaintiff&apos;s published works 
were cited and commented on ; and, on the other hand, 
passages from well-known writers, such as Mackintosh, 
were cited in support of the opinions he had expressed, 
in favour of the Jesuits and the like, to show that candid 
and learned Protestants liad not hesitated to put forward 
similar sentiments. On the part of the defendant, an 
extract from Hobart&apos;s ** Mornings with the Jesuits*&apos; was 
tendered, but objected to on the part of the plaintiff, as not 
partaking of the character of a work of history, so as to 
entitle the defendant to read it. The objection, however, 
was not pressed, as there had been some latitude allowed 
on either side (b).

SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 



619 



The plaintiff was cross-examined in support of the state- 
ment of the defendant in his first letter, that the foreign 
papers he was employed to abstract contained documents 
received from foreign parts during the period in which 
occurred the important religious struggles on the continent 
and the &apos;&apos; treasonable attempts and plans of the Jesuits 
against the life of Qjaeen Eh&apos;zabeth and the safety of the 
realm of England/&apos; and that he approved of these at- 
tempts. He avowed his admiration of the Jesuits, but de- 
declared his disbelief in these attempts as against her life, 
and attributed the supposed plots rather to the schemes set 
on foot by crafty statesmen to ruin the Catholics (a). 

Bovill, on behalf of the defendant, put in and relied on 
the extracts cited by the defendant in the libels complained 
of, as historical works, confirming the view he had taken 
as to the danger of loss or injury to the documents. And he 
also cited a passage from Jardine&apos;s *&apos; Criminal Trials&quot; (6) 



1861. 



(a) Probably alluding to the 
disclosures in such cases as that of 
Parry; of whom Mr. Jardine says 
(Criminal Trials, vol. 1, p. 249) 
&quot; from his correspondence when 
abroad, it is manifest that his 
occupation was the basest and most 
odious espionage,&quot;&amp;c.; and that 
*&apos; the statements of so base a wretch 
can hardly be entitled to much 
credit&apos;&apos; (Ibid. p. 276). It was 
upon the statements of this man 
that the charges against the Jesuits 
were first brought forward ; and as 
regards plots for assassinations, they 
were always denied by persons of 
the plaintiflTs opinions. 

(6) This passage is as follows : 
and other passages from the same 
work are added : whence it will be 
seen how far it confirms or refutes 
the view taken by the defendant. 

Mr. Jardine states in his Criminal 



Trials,&quot; The most satisfactory means 
of enlarging the report of Garnet&apos;s 
trial have been derived from the 
documents in the State Paper 
Office. Most of the original letters, 
confessions, and examinations re- 
lating to the subject, are still to 
be found in that depository : and 
many of these, the originals of which 
are lost, are so fully abstracted in 
the various contemporary works in 
which Garnet&apos;s connection with the 
plot has been discussed, that their 
substance may be readily ascer- 
tained ♦ • ♦• it may be asserted 
with confidence that there is liuk 
of&apos; the material evidence against 
Garnet which is not now accessible 
to those who may have sufficient 
curiosity and patience to pursue 
the enquiry/&apos; (Jardine&apos;s Criminal 
Trials, vol. 2, p. 236.) The same 
learned writer states that *&apos; Garnet&apos;s 




620

defendant. 

connection with the plot forms an 
historical problem of very difficult 
tolutian,&quot; (Ibid. p. 196.) There 
was here therefore a material mis- 
statement, but it was not proved to 
have been so at the time : doubt- 
less it was not wilful. Thus Mr. 
Jardine observes in his comments 
on the papers used at Garnet&apos;s 
trial: &quot;but the above papers are 
still in existence at the State Paper 
Office in Garnet&apos;s handwriting; 
and no doubt can exist as to their 
genuineness. They contain nothing 
inconsistent with Garnet&apos;s state- 
ments on the trial : taken by them- 
selves, indeed, they rather strengthen 
his defence*&apos;* (p. 323). In Mr. 
Jardine&apos;s comments on what he 
calls the ** iniquitous &quot; use made, at 
the trial, of one of Garnet&apos;s exa- 
minations, he says, &quot;as appears 
from the original in the State Paper 
Office, it was garbled, so as to 
amount to a forgery of evidence 
against him&quot;(pp. 356—358). How 
could the plaintiff, or any admirer 
of the Jesuits, wish to suppress such 
papers? 

Then again, Mr. Jardine, in a 
note to the paper of Tresham&apos;s 
confession, upon the words &quot; I told 
your lordship to avoid ill usrige&quot; 
observes, &apos;&apos;This paper is taken from 
the original at the State Paper 
Office. The passage in italics is 
in the original marked for omission 
in reading it at the trial, in order 
that it might not appear to the 
public that any threats or force had 
been used to Tresham &quot; (p. 307). 
It is manifest that no one of the 
plaintiff*s opinions would wish to 



to show bona fides on the 



suppress these documents ; as tbey 
would a£Rird him the most powerful 
arguments, which similar observa- 
tion applies to aU the State papers 
relating to the events of those days, 
especially relating to State trials; 
for the same learned writer points 
out that the only evidence used 
was the confessions or examinations 
of the accused — usually wrung from 
them by torture : and the originaU 
of which, upon the face of theoi, 
often suggest the unfair means 
which has been employed to extort 
them, or the unfair use made of 
them. No one of the plaintiff&apos;s 
opinions could desire to get rid of 
them, but rather to preserve them. 
Other illustrations will be found 
in Mr. Jardine&apos;s comments on tlie 
trial of the conspirators for the 
Powder Plot ; in which he shows 
that the narrative published by the 
government is of no historical 
authority, and shows this by the 
interlineations and alterations ob- 
servable upon the originals (Cri- 
minal Trials, vol. 2, p. 5). &quot; A few 
instances of this dishonesty,&quot; he 
says, &quot; deserve to be noted. The 
declaration of Fawkes was pub- 
lished artfully without a date, hot 
the date appears from the original;&quot; 
and then he shows an interpolation 
made in the pretended copy : so in 
several other instances.&quot; So another 
instance occurs in the confession of 
Thomas Winter.&lt;*The original 
is lost, but in a contemporaneous 
copy of it in the State Paper Office, 
there is a marginal remark in the 
handwriting of the king, designat-

Bovillf on the part of the defendant, denied that the 1861. 
fair meaning of the passage especially complained of in 
the libel was, that the plaintiff would burn or destroy, or 
mutilate the documents, but contended that it was only 
an incidental historical illustration of a general argument, 
as to the danger of entrusting such documents to persons 
of strong views. And the case for the defendant in sub- 
stance was, that the matter was one of public interest, in 
which, in a newspaper controversy, which the plaintiff 
himself had begun, the defendant had a right to express 
his opinion ; that there was no actual or personal malice, 
and that the alleged libels, if defamatory, were privileged. 

In support of this defence the defendant was called, and 
stated that his attention had first been called to the sub- 
ject by a letter in the Athenceum of September, 1859, 
before which time he had not been acquainted with the 
plaintiff. In consequence of that article he laid the 
matter before the Protestant Alliance, and a memorial was 
resolved upon and prepared and presented under his auspices 
as already stated, the usual means being taken to procure 
signatures, by circulation of papers and the like. 

He explained as oversights the misstatements as to the 
nature of the plaintiff&apos;s duties, and as to the purport of the 
Master of the Rolls&apos; letter. 

He disclaimed all personal ill-will or desire to injure the 
plaintiff, and declared his only object was to discuss what 
he deemed a question of public interest.

Many other instances of interpo- upon the origino/ (/orumfn^t: which,

are sufficient to show that it ought disbelieved in the plot; not that he 

not to be depended upon as a approved of it. 




622 CASES AT THE 

1861. Nor was there any evidence of personal malice towards 

the plaintiff^ except so far as it might be inferred from the 
tone of the second letter, written after the imputation of 
&apos;&apos;deliberate falsehood/&apos; that there was some natural 
irritation on that score. 

It was admitted that the plaintiff was a gentleman of 
honour and high character, and incapable of destroying, 
mutilating, or purloining documents with which he was 
entrusted. But it was contended that it was a fit and fair 
subject for public discussion, how far he might be liable 
to temptation so to act, considering his polemical ante- 
cedents, and the strong feelings he had betrayed in former 
writings. 

Bovilly in order to support his case and show bona fides 
on the defendant, tendered articles in newspapers, seen by 
the parties, against the plaintiff&apos;s appointment 

Erlb, C. J., said, the question is, whether the occasion 
was one which would justify the publication of defamatory 
matter, which must depend upon the circumstances under, 
which the publication was made, not upon the opinions 
about those matters which may have been expressed at the 
time. It is for the jury to determine as to the absence or 
presence of malice in the defendant, and I am of opinion 
that it is entirely irrelevant to consider what was published 
on the subject at the same time. 

Bovill. — ^These articles are not offered as matters of 
opinion, but as matters of fact ; to show that there was, to 
the knowledge of both parties, a public discussion on the 
subject. 

Erle, C. J. — That no doubt will be admitted, and may 
be taken as an established and notorious fact. 

The defendant, in the course of his evidence, put in the 
&quot; Constitutions of the Jesuits,&quot; and referred to a passage, 
the purport of which is, that the rules are not obUgare 
ad peccatum, not to bind under (t. e., under pain of) 




SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. fi23 

silly unless by the express command of a superior; and 1861 
he stated that the meaning was, that the command of the 
superior would bind, even though it were to commit sin. 

Erle, C. J.f pointed out that this was a construction, 
not consistent with the whole character of the constitutions ; 
and suggested that it could scarcely be correct. 

There was no evidence that any persons of the opinions 
of the plaintiff had, in point of fact, ever destroyed or 
mutilated public documents of historical importance ; the 
instances mentioned in the historical works cited, not being 
proved to have attached to persons of such opinions (a)^ 
And it was proved on the part of the plaintiff, that no docu- 
ments had been lost from the office while he was there. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The case has taken up a 
great deal of time ; but not more than proportioned to its 
importance. 

The plaintiff complains of libels suggesting that he was 
capable of mutilating or destroying documents with which 
he was entrusted, and as it is mentioned that he has in his 
sitting-room at the office a fire; as if he were likely to 
throw any of them into it^ while he is sitting there 
alone. 

There is no doubt that the matter so complained of is 
libellous/fr) and would entitle the plaintiff to your verdict, 
unless the defendant can establish a defence. 

Now, the law is, that defamatory matter is presumed to 
be malicious, unless it is published in the performance of any 
duty, legal or moral, or in the exercise of any right. 

The defence, on the present occasion, comes under the 
last head, as a matter necessary to the protection of the 
public interests, or the exercise of a public right. 

And the law is, that a man may publish defamatory

is a matter on which the public have any interest, within 
the limits I will lay down, in accordance with decided cases. 

&quot; Every person has a right to comment on the acts of a 
public man, which concern him as a subject of the realm, 
if he do not make his comments the vehicle of malice or 
slander.&quot; 

The. defendant, in this case, contends that he comes 
within this rule ; that he, as a subject of the realm, having 
an interest in the Foreign State papers, with which the 
plaintiff was entrusted, had a right to refer to, and com- 
ment on, the plaintifTs employment, and the plaintiff&apos;s 
character in that office. 

And I am of opinion that the occasion would justify the 
comments, provided they can be brought within the limits 
laid down by the law in this class of cases. 

The rule in these cases is, that the comments are justi6ed, 
provided the defendant honestly {a) believed that they were 
fair and just. 

With that limitation the law allows the publication. 

The word &quot; malice&quot; in law means any corrupt motive, any 
wrong motive, or any departure from duty (J). 

And for the purpose of the present trial, I shall lay it 
down, that if you are of opinion that the defendant, in the 
comments that he made, was guilty of any wilful misrepre- 
sentation of fact, either by the exaggeration of what 
actually existed, or by the partial suppression of what 
actually existed, so as to give it another colour ; or if he 
made his comments with any misstatement of fact which 
he must have known to be a misstatement, if he exercised

ordinary care (a), then he loses his privilege, and the occa- 
sion does not justify the publication, which would then be 
actionable, and the verdict must then be for the plaintiff. 

Now the counsel for the plaintiff, in order to show that 
the defendant did not honestly beUeve his statements to be 
true, relied on several alleged misstatements or misrepre- 
sentations by him of certain matters of fact. And you are 
to consider whether this has been made out The misre- 
presentations thus relied on are, as to the nature of the 
documents entrusted to the plaintiff, or of bis duties in 
respect thereto, or to the precautions stated to have been 
taken against him ; and, chiefly, as to his being capable of 
the immoral acts imputed to him, or suggested by the 
defendant as likely to be committed. 

These are all matters for you to consider, on the issue 
which you have to decide. With regard to the first head, 
the nature of the plaintiff&apos;s duties, and the documents 
entrusted to him, the defendant admits that in July, 1860, 
the letter of the Master of the Rolls was read in his 
presence, and the plaintiff contends that this should have 
shown the defendant that his alarms were unfounded ; and 
that before he put forth any further publications on the 
subject he should have gone to the office and made 
further inquiries. This is for you to consider, with a 
view to forming a judgment as to the bona fides of the 
charges suggested in the defendant&apos;s subsequent letters, 
which form the libels complained of. 

Then, again, you are to consider the antecedents of 
the plaintiff, as they might have been known to the defend- 
ant, and to judge whether, under the circumstances, the 
continuance of these publications, down to the time of the 
plaintiff&apos;s resignation, was bond fide. And you are especially 
to consider whether, it being admitted by the counsel for

committed by him. It is for you to judge whether the 
misstatement was reckless, or made with a want of 
ordinary care and caution; and whether the comments 
made on the plaintiff&apos;s former writings were fair and 
just. 

The plaintiff has avowed that he admires the Jesuits, 
and it is suggested that they have inculcated duplicity, 
mental reservation, and tampering with truth. But, if so, 
it is not the less true that they have carried out the prin- 
ciples of Christianity with remarkable devotion, and that 
mankind are indebted to them for labours in science and 
in literature and religion all over the world. One man has 
as much a right to declare that he holds them in veneration 
for what they have done for mankind, as another has to 
hold them in aversion or in scorn. Some of them may 
have deserved one character, some of them the other. 
And if the defendant, in publishing of the plaintiff that 
he held them in admiration, put it forth as if the 
plaintiff approved of what was deceitful or &quot; Jesuitical,&quot; in 
the sense in which we use the word, that would not be fair 
or just, unless he honestly believed that the plaintiff really 
did approve of deceit and falsehood (a). The defendant 
in his letters alludes to the piaintiff^s mention of Garnet the 
Jesuit as the &apos;&apos; martyr.&quot; But his guilt has been matter of 
very grave discussion, among men who have looked into 
the subject with interest (&amp;).

and Stuarts, and in the time of James I., which any man „ ^^

capable of judging of evidence, or the principles of criminal v. 

judicature, must read with great pain (a); and, in re- 
spect of Garnet, there has been great controversy, some 
maintaining that he was wrongly convicted ; and it is 
manifest that the plaintiff is of that opinion. It is a 
question open to controversy (b). Was it fair towards the 
plaintiff to say that he was &quot; naturally biassed&quot; in favour 
of Garnet, *&apos; who was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot,*&apos; 
as if sanctioning that plot? Then the defendant alluded 
to the plaintiff&apos;s speaking of Babington&apos;s conspiracy as a 
&apos;&apos;gallant confederacy*&apos; (c). But if all which Babington 
confessed was, joining a band of gentlemen to liberate 
Mary, Queen of Scots, that might well be called a 
&apos;&apos;gallant confederacy.&quot; All these and similar matters 
are relied on by the defendant, as showing that he had 
fair grounds for publishing these statements of the plain- 
tiff, and it is for you to say if they do so. 
The matters they refer to are open subjects of controversy,

and on which oppoBite opioions may fairly be expressed. 
But what you have to consider is, whether, after what had 
come to the knowledge of the defendant^ he fairly and 
honestly, in the exercise of the privilege the law allows, 
put forth the passages complained of— chiefly that last — 
in which there is the allusion to the fire, and the sug- 
gestion of the danger of papers being destroyed by the 
plaintiff. 

Verdict for the defendant (a). 



(a) It was intended to move for 
a new trial, but the cause was 
settled by each party paying his 
own costs. The reporter has reason 
to believe that the verdict went 
upon a doubt as to whether the 
words mainly relied on by the 
plaintiff ftieant that he would bum 
the papers, or that some persons of 
his opinions might do so. This 
was clearly for the jury, although 
the Lord Chief Justice did not 
deem it necessary formally to leave 
it to the jury. And the following 
case seems in some respects to 
illustrate the present one. 

*&apos; In case for libel, the declara- 
tion stated that the plaintiff was a 
Roman Catholic priest, and priest 
of a chapel named, and that the 
defendant, intending to injure him 
in his said offices, published of him, 
in those offices, a libel, which was 
set out The alleged libel contained 
an account of a Roman Catholic 
having been seen performing a 
penance, which was suggested to 
be of a degrading kind, and added 
that the party performing the pen- 
ance said that his priest would not 
administer the sacrament to him 
till he had performed it, and that 
his priest was the plaintiff. The 



declaration also set forth certain 
comments of the defendant, ac- 
companying the publication, and 
in which the Roman Catholic dis- 
cipline was attacked. The libel was 
not otherwise connected with the 
plaintiff^ nor was there any allega- 
tion showing how the enjoining of 
such a penance would affect the 
character of a Roman Catholic 
priest. Judgment was arrested, 
the Court holding that the publica- 
tion was not, on the face of it, 
libellous, and refusing, even upon 
the assumption that the plaintiff 
was charged with imposing the 
penance, to intend that the jury 
had evidence before them of an 
injury to the plaintiff which the 
declaration did not show, though 
some evidence to that purpose was 
in fact given. Hearne ▼. Stawellt

&apos;* Held, that,if the publication had 
been libellous, it would not have 
been justifiable on the ground that 
it was promulgated at a public 
meeting called to petition Parlia- 
ment against making a grant in 
support of a Roman Catbdic 
college.&quot; lb.

which it has been to broadly laid 
down that any discussion on a ques- 
tion of public interest makes a bond 
Jide publication privileged ; and it 
has oeen held n^t to justify a 
report; DavUon v. Duncan, 7 E,&amp;B. 229. But it should seem 
that it is to be collected, as the 
general principle, lying at the 
basis of all the reported decisions 
in favour of the privilege of publica^ 
tion, whether in the way of report 
or criticism. See I&apos;arU v. Levy, 



ante, p. 71 (confirmed in 30 L- J., 
C. P. 11) ; and see per Willes, J., 
Eastwood V. Holmet, 1 Fos.&amp;Fin. 
p. 347. The words &apos;&apos;public in- 
terest,&quot; as an element of privilege, 
in criminal prosecutions, in the case 
of newspapers, were imported by 
Lord Campbell into his Libel Act, 
6&amp;7 Vict. c. 96, doubtless not from 
any mere notion of his own, but 
as derived from what that great 
lawyer deemed to be the law on 
the subject, as applicable to actions.

Action for wroDgful dismissal. 

Declaration^ that in consideration that the plaintiff would 
enter into the service of and give the whole of his services 
to the defendant and be subject to his advice and guidance, 
if necessary, for three years, in the capacity of buyer in a 
certain business of the defendant&apos;s at a yearly salary of 
600/., payable monthly, the defendant promised the plaintiff 
to retain him in the said service during the said period, 
in the said capacity, and on the terms aforesaid. 

Averment, that the plaintiff entered into the said ser%ice 
in the capacity and on the terms aforesaid, and so con- 
tinued until the breach, and was always ready to continue 
in it and give the whole of his services to the defendant, 
and be subject as aforesaid in the capacity aforesaid. 
Breach, that the defendant wrongfully dismissed the 
plaintiff from the said service. 

Pleas : 1. That the defendant did not promise as alleged. 

2. That the plaintiff did not enter into, nor was in, 
supposed service, in the capacity and on the terms afore- 
said.

service {a), wherefore the defendant dismissed him. 

Macaulay and Needham for the plaintiff. 

Hawkins and Aspland for the defendant. 

The defendants were warehousemen, and, wanting a 
lace- buyer, applied to the plaintiff to enter into their 
service as such, which he agreed to do, the following 
memorandum being given him : — 

•* Messrs. Mouatt agree to engage Mr. Price for three 
years at 600/. a year, payable monthly, he to give the whole 
of his services, and to be advised and guided by them, if 
necessary.&quot; 6th August, 1869. 

Both parties signed this ; which, it will be observed, did 
not mention the capacity in which he was engaged. 

The plaintiff stated that he acted as buyer ; and that, 
as such, it was his duty to purchase and see that the goods 
were properly sold. 

In September, 1869, the partner who engaged him re- 
tired, and the others seemed anxious to get rid of him, 
and proposed his leaving or taking a smaller salary, which 
he declined. 

In December the defendants told him they were not 
satisfied with his buying, and that in future another party 
would buy, and that he might go. The plaintiff declined, 
and claimed to continue in the capacity of buyer. 



(a) Quare whether this must be did import that, of course it was 

taken to import ** in the iaid eapa- disproved, as the order was clearly

if not, the plea was good? If it 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 531 

One day, in January, 1861, after this, being at his duty 1861 
in that capacity, one of the defendants said rudely to him, 
&quot;Can&apos;t you find a job?&quot; The plaintiff replied, civilly, 
&quot; If you will point out one, I shall be very happy.&quot; The 
defendant said, &quot; Card this lace.&quot; &quot; That,&quot; said the plain- 
tiff, &quot; is only work fit for boys ; I can&apos;t do that.&quot; The 
defendant then said, peremptorily, &quot;If you refuse, take 
your hat and go; leave the premises!&quot; The plaintiff 
thereupon left. 

It was no part of bis duty, as buyer, to card lace. 

He had left a good situation to come to the defendants, 
and had not since been able to find another; the em- 
ployment as buyer being very good, and not easy to 
replace. 

The action was brought in March, 1861 (a). He had 
not applied for employment, but stated that, if a buyer had 
been wanted, he should have heard of it. 

The defendants called no witnesses. 

Hawkins objected that the written memorandum did 
not mention the employment as buyer. 

The Lord Chief Justice overruled the objection. The 
memorandum was merely to satisfy the Statute. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — The material question is, 
did the plaintiff wilfully disobey a lawful order? For dis- 
obedience may not be wilful, even if of a lawful order. 

First, was it a lawful order ? 

Secondly, was the refusal a wilful disobedience of the 
order ? 

The question is for you. It is obvious that the de- 
fendants wanted to get rid of the plaintiff. 

As to damage, it clearly cannot be the whole amount, 
750/. ; for the plaintiff was bound to turn his talents to 
reasonable account. On the other hand, it appears that 
the employment was one of a peculiar character, not easily

Holmes Phipson (with him Lush) for the defendants. 

Worthing- ^^^ defendants were brewers and had stores at Birming- 
ham, where there was a crank for the purpose of hoisting 
barrels from the cellar to the ground floor. They had 
entered on the premises on the 1st January, 1860. 
The brewers having previously occupied them, and used 
the same machinery. There were two ropes used, called 
the cellar rope and the crank rope, which was worn, and 
the hook loosened. The plaintiff was defendants&apos; cellar- 
man, and it was his duty to sling the barrels in the ropes, 
and they were thus hauled up a kind of wooden framework 
laid on the cellar steps. Having attached the ropes by 
the hooks, he had nothing further to do, and the barrels 
were hauled up by a man above, at the top of the steps. 
Soon after the defendants entered he complained to their 
manager and to them of the state of the ropes and 
hooks. 

The defendants said that they should be seen to, and 
a new hook was put on the crank rope, but nothing was 
done to the other, the cellar rope, and while the plaintiff 
was using it in raising a barrel, it broke, and the barrel 
fell upon him. 

At the close of the plaintiff&apos;s case, 

Phipson, for the defendants, claimed a nonsuit : the 
allegation in the declaration that the plaintiff* used the 
machinery without notice of its state, not only not being 
proved, but being disproved. The plaintiff cannot recover, 
according to the decided cases (a).

cbinery is in an unsafe statei and the servant goes on 
using it under a reasonable belief that it will be set right 
by the employer, and it is not set right and he suffers an 
injury, he cannot sustain an action. The master may 
choose to be too chary of repairs for the sake of economy. 
No doubt if, knowing this, the servant chooses to use the 
machine, he may lose his remedy ; just as in the case of a 
man taking employment at a gunpowder factory. But 
there may be a case in which he relies on the master&apos;s 
getting the repairs done, and I will take the opinion of 
the jury on the matter, reserving leave to the defendant to 
move, as the case may turn out. 

Phipson then called the foreman or manager, who said 
the plaintiff had complained of the ropes, and that the 
defendants had promised that the matter should be looked 
to, but that the rapes did not require repair. It transpired, 
however, that there had been a new rope ordered imme- 
diately afler the accident, and the ropemaker being called 
said the ropes had been changed, because of the accident. 

The plaintiff had sworn the defendants were told that the 
ropes were unsafe, and that they had promised to see to it, 
and they were not called to contradict this. 

WiLLBS, J. (to the jury). — If the defendants knew of the 
defect and undertook to repair it, and the plaintiff went on 
working, relying on their repairing it, then they may be 
liable. If the plaintiff complained of the defect, and the 
defendants promised that it should be remedied, he is not 
to be deprived of his remedy, merely because, relying on 
their promise, he remained in their employment. You 
must, however, be satisfied that they were aware of the 
defect, and that the accident arose from it, and not from 

plaintiff&apos;s want of care. 

Verdict for the plaintiff, 100/. 

Phipson thereupon applied for leave to move for stay 
of execution, contending that the issue as to notice must 
be found for the defendants ; but

WiLLBS; J. — It must be read either as alleging that the 
plaintiff did not use the ropes with proper care, but so care- 
lessly as to contribute to the accident, in which sense it 
only raises the same defence as arises tinder the general 
issue, and must be found for the plaintiff; or, if it is merely 
a negation that he was ignorant of the defect, and a 
general averment that he used the ropes carelessly, which 
would be a bad plea, as such it must be proved tn onint&amp;M, 
and the latter part is not proved. Moreover, I am disposed 
to think that the jury might even find the first part of the 
plea for the plaintiff, for if knowledge may mean belief on 
sufficient grounds, as he had his master&apos;s assurance that 
the defect should be remedied, he might well be said to 
have had no knowledge at the time of the accident that 
the defect existed. But at all events the allegation as it 
stands &apos;in the declaration is immateiial ; and if I am asked 
to do so, I will strike it out, and you may bring error if 
you like, but I will not stay execution.

The plaintiff being examined, and he having stated that 
he was on the board at the time, and that it was pushed 
from under him, and this not agreeing with the declaration 
as it stood, he was cross-examined as to a statement he 
had made at the time of the accident, which was in

after having been drawn in accordance with the statement 
of the plaintiff, and then amended. Moreover, I am not 
aware of any case in which an amendment has been allowed 
after an amendment made on demurrer. My difficulty 
is, that the declaration is in a state in which the cause of 
action is doubtful, and then it is proposed at the trial to 
amend it in accordance with the plaintiff&apos;s evidence so as 
to make a good cause of action, but at variance with the 
declaration as previously drawn on his own statement.

CASES AT THE 

Oq the Ist June, 1857, a letter in the Dame of 
Davis and Co. was written to the North-Eastern Railway 
Company in these terms : — &apos;&apos; We are in a position to renew 
the bond for three years, at five per cent interest, and 
one quarter commission to us.^ To this the secretary 
replied, by a letter addressed to Davis and Co., to the effect 
that four and three quarters per cent, was their maximum 
rate of interest, &quot; and as to your claim for commission, we 
never allow it for renewal of loans.&apos;&apos; This was communi- 
cated to the plaintiff by a private letter from his brother, 
who asked, &apos;^ Shall I offer it to the Great Western at five 
percent.?&quot; To this the plaintiff replied, &quot; If you think 
there is any probability of their doing it, you can try the 
effect of a letter to the secretary, Sec,&quot; On the 6th 
June, 1857, a letter in the name of Davis and Co., was 
then written to the Great Western Railway Company, who 
replied in a letter addressed to Davis and Co., and assent- 
ing to the offer. A copy of this was communicated to the 
plaintiff by his brother, in a private letter from himself. 
And on the 10th June the plaintiff replied to him thus : — 
&quot;Arrange with the Great Western,&amp;c.,&amp;c , you can ex- 
plain that the 4,000/. is payable on the 15th,&amp;c.,&amp;c.&apos;&apos; 
There had been another similar offer in the letters from 
Davis and Co. as to another sum of money : and this also 
having been assented to on the 12th, the secretary of the 
Great Western Company sent Davis and Co. an order on 
Glyn and Co., their bankers, to receive that sum. On the 
13th June this was acknowledged in a letter from&apos; Davis 
and Co. ending thus : &quot; We can now let you have 4,000/., 
at five per cent., payable about the 15th next month, and 
a quarter per cent, commission to us.&quot; On the 15th June 
the Great Western Company wrote to Davis and Co. 
agreeing to this : and this was at once communicated to the 
plaintiff and his brother, as before, in a private letter 
ending thus: &quot;The parties named in the debenture will 
have to sign a receipt on the document when it is about

due. You can send it to me, when I will make the neces-- 
sary money exchange.*&apos; On the 18th June the plaintiff 
was informed, by a letter from the secretary of the North- 
Eastern Railway Company, that the debenture would be 
paid on the 15th July, &apos;&apos; if presented at Glyn&apos;s, with a 
receipt in the subjoined form indorsed thereon.&quot; The form 
subjoined was as follows : — 

&apos;&apos; Form of Receipt to he indorsed on the Bond and signed by 
the Mortgagee* 

&apos;&apos; Received this day of 1859, of the 

North- Eastern Railway Company, the within-mentioned 
principal sum of £ , and I do hereby acknowledge 

to have received all interest due thereoq.&quot; 

(When taken by the defendant the debenture was in- 
dorsed with such a receipt signed by the plaintiff.) 

The plaintiff, on the 23rd June, wrote to his brother : 
&apos;&apos; I have had a letter from the Company that the 4,000/. will 
be paid at Glyn&apos;s, on the debenture being presented there,, 
with receipt indorsed. Shall I send the debenture with the 
receipt indorsed to you, or how ?&quot; 

The plaintiff^s brother wrote back : ** You had better 
send it to me, or the Great Western Railway Company 
may do me out of my commission.&quot; 

For the brother to secure this commission, however, it 
was necessary for the reason already stated, (he not being a 
broker,) that the transfer should take place in the name of 
Davis, The plaintiff, on the Uth July, sent the debenture 
to his brother at Davis&apos;s with a receipt indorsed in the 
form before mentioned, being inclosed in a private letter to 
his brother. 

On the 13th July the plaintiff^s brother acknowledged 
the receipt of the debenture in a private letter to the plain- 
tiff, in which he said &quot; it will be attended to.&quot; 

On the 15th July, the day before the debenture was due, 
Davis wrote to the North- Eastern Railway Company to

koow where it was to be presented, and they telegraphed&lt;&lt;present at Glyn&apos;s.&quot; On the 16th July it was taken to the 
defendants by a clerk of Davis&apos;s (not the plaintiff&apos;s brother, 
but another), and being shown to them with the telegraphic 
message, they were asked to &quot; cash&quot; it : and they agreed 
to do so for 5/., one eighth per cent, commission. And 
they accordingly paid Davis on that day the amount due 
upon it (less 6/.) on a cheque drawn on them, signed 
&quot; Davis and Co.&quot;—&quot; Pay 4,000/. to me or bearer.&quot; The 
debenture was then handed to the defendants, who sent it 
to their agents, Barclay and Co., in London, and through 
them received the amount from Glyn&apos;s; they handing 
Glyn&apos;s the debenture, and being credited in account for 
4,000/. Davis then remitted 1 ,000/. to Glyn&apos;s, to be placed 
to the credit of the Great Western Railway Company, on 
account of the proposed debenture, but he paid no more. 
The plaintiff and his brother were not aware of this until 
August, when Davis died insolvent. Had the transaction 
been completed, according to the intention of the plaintiff, 
they would have simply transferred the amount to the 
credit of that Company : from whom the plaintiffs, through 
Davis, would have received their debenture. In September 
the debenture was demanded of the defendants on behalf 
of the plaintiffs, who then disavowed any authority to 
Davis. The defendants declared that they had paid it in the 
regular course of business, and denied any liability. The 
plaintifis claimed the amount of the debenture, except the 
1,000/. received by the Great Western Company. 

The plaintiff was called, and swore that he did not know 
that the business was being carried on by Davis and Co. : 
that he had in May verbally instructed his brother to see 
to the re-investment of the money ; and that on the 5th 
July, knowing that Glyn and Co. were the bankers of both 
Companies, he told his brother (by word of mouth) that all 
he would have to do would be to transmit the debenture to 
Glyn&apos;s, with directions to pay the money to the Great

Western Companyi and that Uiis was the only instruction 
he gave him about it. He further stated, on cross-exami- 
nation, that though he knew his brother was not in 
business on his own account, his impression was that he was 
allowed to transact business for his own relations. The 
plaintifTs brother was called, and confirmed his evidence 
as to the instructions he received, and stated that he gave 
the debenture to Davis, and told him to send it up to Glyn 
and Co., (which Davis promised to do,) and that he had 
heard nothing more about it until towards the end of the 
month : and that he was not aware, until after Davis&apos;s death, 
that the debenture bad not been sent to Glyn&apos;s, 

There was some little discrepancy between the evidence 
of the clerk of Davis, who took the debenture to the de- 
fendants, and the defendants&apos; clerk who received it, as to 
the precise terms employed by the former ; whether it was 
that he asked that it should be&apos;&apos; cashed&quot; or &apos;&apos;discounted,&quot; 
or paid and transmitted to Glyn&apos;s. One of the defendants 
was called, and stated that their charge for commission 
would have been the same, had they waited to hear that the 
debenture was paid in liOndon before themselves paying 
for it; but that, where they knew the person, they gave the 
money at once. As already stated Davis banked with them, 
and most of the money (less the 1,000/. remitted to the 
Great Western Company) had been placed to his credit in 
their account. 

On the part of the defendants it was contended that there 
was an implied authority to him to deal with the debenture 
as he had done. 

The LoBD Chibf Baron was of opinion, that, as the 
instrument was not negotiable nor payable to bearer, and 
there was no authority from the plaintiff to Davis, the 
latter had no authority to receive the money, but reserved th^ 
point, and directed the verdict formally to be entered for 
the plaintiffs, for the balance of the amount of the deben-

claiming it, the defendant disputing the claim ; and the 
point being reserved, neither party asking that it should 
be submitted to the jury. 

Verdict for the plaintiff, 3,000/. (a). 



(a) Sir F. Kelly, on the part 
of the defendant, obtained a rule 
TMi to set aside the verdict on the 
ground that it was not proved that 
the defendant converted the deben- 
ture to his own use, or that he de- 
tained the plaintifis&apos; debenture; or 
bad received money to the use of 
the plaintifis, and also as to in- 
terest. Against this rule, cause was 



shown by BomU and Tondinson 
and the Court came to the con- 
clusion that it was a question of 
fact&apos;toAe/Aer the debenture was ptU 
tn/o the handi of Davis by the 
plaintiff or with his authority ; and 
ultimately, the etidenee on that 
point not being satisfactory, ordered 
a new trial : but the case was 
settled.

Brahwbll, B. (to the jury). — Did the defendant autho- 
rize the auctioneer to put down his name as bidder? and 
was he the real buyer? With that view consider whether 
the auctioneer knew that he was foreman of Smith, and 
whether he might have reasonably understood that He 
was bidding for Smith ? Even if there were an original 
contract with Barton, was there a subsequent implied 
contract with Smith, arising out of the delivery of the 
goods to and acceptance by him, with the knowledge of 
both parties? In either of these views find for the

ference to an advertisement of an advowson that he had &apos;^&apos;&apos;&apos;^wiia. 
for sale. The plaintiff gave the defendant a printed list 
of the advowsons that he had for sale, upon which was 
printed the plaintiff&apos;s terms, viz., that he was to be paid a 
commission of one and a half per cent, by both buyer and 
seller, but he did not call the defendant&apos;s attention to these 
terms. The negotiation proceeded, and ultimately the 
defendant offered, by letter, the sum of 11,0002. for the 
advowson, this offer the plaintiff accepted on behalf of the 
vendor. 

At the close of the plaintiff&apos;s case the defendant&apos;s coun-

Martin, B., said : — It was formerly the practice for a 
judge at Nisi Prius, not to inquire into matters which were 
admitted on both sides, but I know Lord Campbell has 
decided such a course to be wrong. I must therefore have 
the fact of the sale proved in the regular way before the

It appeared that in April, 1860, Arrowsmith, one of the 
partners in the firm of Cunard and Co., had entered into a 
speculation with Lamb, the acceptor, for the exportation 
and sale of 12,000 muskets to the Garibaldians at Naples. 
The muskets were shipped and sold, and a bill was drawn 
by Arrowsmith, in the names of Cunard and Co., upon 
Lamb, and accepted by him, to provide for the freight, in- 
surance,&amp;c. of the muskets. Afler several renewals (of 
which the bill in question was one)&gt;it became necessary to 
provide for payment of the bill for 550/. That bill was 
then in the hands of the Bank of Loudon, and Lamb con- 
sulted Sunley, one of the plaintifis, as to the best mode of 
dealing with it Sunley, at Lamb&apos;s instance, called on 
Arrowsmith, and not being able to get him to provide for 
the bill, Sunley and Lamb proceeded together to the Bank 
of London. They there saw the manager of the bank, 
and Sutiley paid the amount, and obtained possession of 
the bill, the bank agreeing to indorse, but to prevent their 
liability, with the addition of the words &apos;&apos; sans secours.&quot; 
It was now contended for the defendants, that Sunley 
having paid the bill for Lamb, the acceptor, the bill could 
not be sued upon, but was defunct. On the other hand it 
was contended that Sunley, by such payment, had pur- 
chased the bill of the bank and stood in their shoes.

the next that will be tried. Moreover, the defendant stated 
to the plaintiff&apos;s attorney, so long ago as the 23ixi of last 
October, that he only signed the note as a witness. There 
has therefore been plenty of time for the defendant to 
have pleaded this defence before ; and an amendment now 
would be unfair to the plaintiff, and ought not to be 
allowed. 

Cromfton, J. — I think I ought not to allow the amend- 
ment, without the strongest affidavits of the truth of the 
matter proposed to be pleaded. It is inconvenient to make 
the amendment now ; and possibly the plaintiff is unpre^ 
pared to try the issue sought to be imposed upon him at 
the last moment. 

Hayes, Serjt. — The course now taken has been adopted 
because it was conceived that it would be a saving of 
expense. The plaintiff is perfectly aware of the proposed 
defence, which indeed has been insisted upon by the de- 
fendant from the very first, and is perfectly prepared to 
try that issue. 

Crompton, J. — Would it not be better to refer the 
matter to some competent person, who should have power

man of straw signing his real name. Qu^Bre, whether, if the acceptance had been the genuine 
acceptance of a man of straw, the directing the bill to George Smith, draper, Birmmgham, 
with the fraudulent intention of inducing those to whom the bill was inaorsed to suppose 
that the acceptance was the genuine acceptance of the last-named George Smith, amounted 
to a forgery of the acceptance. 




MIDLAND CIRCUIT. 555 

There was a second count, charging the prisoners with isei. 
uttering the said bill, knowing it to be forged. 

Boden and Bristowe appeared for the prosecution. 

Macaulay and Merewether defended White. 

O&apos;Brien defended Davis. 

It appeared from the evidence^ that White was in busi- 
ness with bis brothers, as lace manufacturers, under the 
name of White, Brothers, and that Davis was a commer- 
cial traveller in their employment. In the early part 
of 1860, Davis received from White the following 
letter : — 

&quot; Dear Sir, — We dare not accept your kind offer, as 
your name is known here. You could do us a great ser- 
vice, if you could get us a lot of blank 3c/. and 6c/. bill 
stamps signed, so that we could pay them away occasionally. 
We could fill up the amounts to suit us. Now such men 
as which your samples about town would do it or any 
friend, because we never let them go back. Our name 
need never be mentioned. Mr. Benson has accommodated 
us, but as he is leaving us we cannot ask him. If we could 
work about 2,000Z. in this way, it would enable us to give 
extended credit to our customers. Now if you can manage 
this department, it will be most valuable, and no risk to 
yourself; and I shall be at home to see all right. You 
can buy any quantity of bill stamps. Send them all 
addressed to me privately. Destroy this note. 

&quot; Yours faithfully, 

&quot; Robert White.&quot; 

In May, 1860, Davis received other letters in the hand- 
writing of White, of which the following are copies : — 

&apos;&apos; Nottingham, May 4th, 1860. 
^* Dear Sir, — I forwarded account to you to bank. I 
received the bill all right — do very well. Let me have 
the inclosed done the first opportunity — you only need let

&quot; Yours truly, 

•&apos; Robert White.&quot; 

On the 23rd of June, the bill, the subject of the present 
indictment, was indorsed by the prisoner White to a Mr. 
Whaley, by whom it was paid into the bank, whence it 
was returned dishonored. Subsequently on being charged 
with forging the bill in question, Davis admitted that he 
had got it signed by a stranger, and produced the above 
letters as proving his innocence. 

A Mr. George Smith, a draper, at Birmingham, was 
called, and proved that the words ** George Smith&quot; in the 
acceptance were not in his handwriting, and that he had 
made inquiries personally, and could not discover any 
other George Smith, a draper, in Birmingham, that he had 
also searched the directory, and that there did not appear 
to be any other George Smith, a draper, in Birmingham, 
from that. 

Macaulay submitted that there was no case to go to the 
jury. — The prisoner is indicted for forging this bill of ex- 
change. There is proof that the words &quot; George Smith&quot; in 
theacceptance are not in the handwriting of the George 
Smith who has been called ; but there is no proof that they 
are not written by some other George Smith, or that the 
George Smith whose name is written across the bill is not a

real person. From the letters that have been put in evidence 
it would appear that Davis was instructed by the prisoner 
White to procure genuine written acceptances, the accept- 
ances of men of straw signing their own names. If Davis 
carried out these instructions, the bills in question would 
not be forgeries, they being accepted by real persons in 
their own names. If the signature is genuine, it is no 
forgery either of the acceptance or of the bill to address it 
to some person, not the acceptor, but bearing the same 
name, with a view to induce others to suppose that the 
person to whom it is addressed is the acceptor. Such con- 
duct would perhaps amount to a false pretence, but could 
not be said to be a forgery of the bill. The real acceptor 
would be liable upon the bill. To direct a bill to 
Mr. Oeorge Smith, draper, Birmingham, such direction 
being nopart of the acceptance, cannot amount to a forgery 
of the acceptance. 

He also submitted that there was no sufficient evidence 
that the acceptance was not the acceptance of another 
George Smith, a draper in Birmingham. Birmingham 
contained 250,000 inhabitants; and it was not sufficient for 
a witness to say that he had made personal inquiries, and 
examined a directory. 

Boden contended that there was primd facie evidence 
that the signature ** George Smith,&quot; in the acceptance, was 
altogether fictitious, and was not the real name of the 
person signing. He also submitted that, assuming the 
signature to be genuine, the directing the bill to Mr. George 
Smith, draper, Birmingham, for the fraudulent purpose of 
inducing others to believe that he was the acceptor of the 
bill, amounted to forgery. In Reg v. Blenkinsop (a), it was 
held, that the adding of a false address to the name of the 
drawer of a bill, while the bill was in thecourseof comple-

tion, in order to make the acceptance appear to be that of a 
different existing person, was a forgery. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — I think that there is a case to go to the 
jury. There is some evidence that the George Smith who 
has been called is the only draper of that name living in 
Birmingham. If there is another George Smith, a draper 
there, he might have been called as a witness for the 
prisoner. I am also of opinion that there is some evidence 
that the name &quot;George Smith&apos;* in the acceptance was 
fictitious, and that the acceptance was not the genuine ac- 
ceptance of a man. of straw signing his real name. With 
regard to the other point more difficulty may arise ; and, if 
the jury find that Davis got the genuine acceptance of a 
real George Smith, and that White, in conjunction with 
Davis, converted it into the simulated acceptance of another 
George Smith, a draper at Birmingham, with the fraudulent 
intention of inducing those to whom he indorsed the bill to 
suppose that it was the genuine acceptance of George 
Smith, the draper, T will reserve a case. 

The jury found that the prisoners got the acceptance 
signed in the name of George Smith, by a person not of 
the name of George Smith, and that the bill was filled up 
by White, and uttered with intent to make it appear that 
the signature was that of George Smith, draper, Birming- 
ham. 

His Lordship directed a verdict of Guilty to be entered.

(a) BeoMiey got a rule in C. P.

or an arrest of judgment Wbere 
Uie date of a contract, as a bond 
or bill, is material, it is taken to be

Strange, 21 ; and the note or bill 
as set out, is admitted if not denied, 
Bevis T. Linsell, Ibid. 1149; and 
that therefore is in issue, (/&apos;denied. 
But the count on a biU does not 
state the date ; and though it states 
that on such a date the bill was 
made, that is clearly not material. 
The question then is, whether the 
allegation that Uie defendant made 
a note or bill, &quot; which is overdue,&quot; 
is not in effect put in issue by the 
plea denying the making or accept- 
ing. Whether that is part of the 
deacriplion of the note or bill, or 
an independent allegation of the 
lapse of time, as in an action of 
covenant for rent, when the fact 
that rent is in arrear, was put in 
issue by a separate plea nens in 
arrere, and was so even before the 
new rules; and was not in issue 
under non demisit, though it would 
have been under nil debet in an 
action of debt. See Gaskin v. Davis, 



ante, p. 295. As the date of the 
bill is not stated in the count, 
can the judgment be arrested? 
BM it cannot appear on the re- 
cord, whether the bQl was or was 
not due before writ And assum- 
ing that the date is not stated 
in the count, a plea that the bill 
was not overdue as allied could 
hardly be deemed a bad plea, for 
it would raise a substantial defence. 
The count, however, only aOeges 
that the bill&lt;*is overdue,&quot; i. c, at 
the time of declaration; whereas 
the old forms allege tliat the &apos;&apos;biU 
became due,&quot; which, without more, 
would import that it became due 
before suit. The present form of 
allegation, however, equally points 
to a time subsequent to the accept- 
ance, and therefore it should seem

but to the lapse of time.

On the 29th January the defendant, the drawer, was at the 
office of the plaintiffs, and stated that the acceptors. Plant

able to meet the bill, for which reason he asked if the 
plaintiff would object to renew it. He was told that the 
directors would consider of it, and on the next day Plant 
called and made the same inquiry, and being asked if

told to call on the Monday, the 4th February, the day 
on which the bill became due, on which day he did call, 
and was told that the directors would renew the bill, but

was sent up to the London and Westminster Bank on the

No notice of dishonour was ever given. The question 
was, whether there had been, on the part of the defendant,

business, between 7th February and 15th April, 1861, and 
the ground on which it was sought to charge the other 
defendant was, that a partnership had existed between 
them, or that he had held himself out, or allowed the other 
to hold him out, as partner with him. 

The defendant Thompson, in January, 1861, had entered 
into negotiations with Blakey, as to a partnership with 
him in his business of cotton spinner, and an oral agree- 
ment was entered into by them on the 26th January, under 
which Blakey was to advance capital, and have a share of 
the profits, and in effect to become a partner.&apos; It was then 
understood, however, between them, that the agreement was 
to be reduced to writing; but the defendant Thompson 
wrote to the plaintiffs informing them of it. Blakey next 
day came to the place of business, and continued there till 
the end of March, being in the counting-house giving 
orders, stopping workmen, and doing all other acts which 
might either be those of a partner, or of a manager, using 
and writing the name of ** Thompson and Co.,&quot; but not 
Thompson and Blakey. On the 2nd February, however, 
Blakey told Thompson he had altered his mind in one 
respect, that he meant to be clerk not partner, and this 
agreement, it was understood, should be put into writing. 
On the 6th February new books were opened in the name 
of Thompson and Co.,&quot; Blakey himself being present 
when the books were bought. On the 14th February the 
agreement in writing was signed ; which stipulated that. 
Thompson should pay Blakey a salary equal in amount to 
one-third of the net profits ; the agreement was to make 
them partners ; but Thompson, at the end of three years 
to admit Blakey as partner. 

The goods sued for were partly and principally, supplied 
after this written agreement, the first item being 9th 
February ; the third on the 15th February, and the rest 
of the supplies between that date and 15th April.

CASES ON THE 

The defendant Blakey, as already mentioned, remained 
on the business premises till the end of March, doing 
acts which might be done either by a partner or a 
manager. 

The other defendant, Thompson, introduced Blakey as 
partner to various persons, but not to the plaintifl^. 

Some of the orders for the goods were by Blakey signed 
&quot; Thompson and Co.&quot; 

It was proved that some of the persons to whom the co- 
defendant had introduced Blakey as his partner had told 
the plaintiffs of this. 

But it was not proved that the defendant Blakey was 
aware of or had authorized any such representations, or 
that the plaintiffs knew of the original oral agreement. 

Martin, B. — ^There were only two ways in which the 
defendant Blakey can be liable, as partner in fact, or as 
having held himself out as partner with the other de- 
fendant. As to a partnership in fact, the written agree- 
ment is what you must regard as the real agreement be-

should be reduced into writing. Then, as regards an 
ostensible partnership, there is no evidence of it ; for there 
is nothing to show that the defendant Blakey authorized 
Thompson to hold him out as partner or held himself out 
as such. And the learned Judge therefore directed a

his house for a week for 14s. The prisoner then said he 

was short of cash, and asked the prosecutor to lend him 6e/. 

which he did. The prisoner remained some days at the

The defendant claimed the goods under a bill of sale. 
On the 13tb December, 1869, the bill of sale was ex- 
ecuted to the defendant by the insolvent for a valuable 
consideration. 

The defendant was father-in-law of the insolvent 
On the 29th July, 1860, a fi.fa., issued against R., the 
insolvent, at the suit of L., one of his assignees; and when 
the officer entered under the writ to seize the goods, tbey 
were claimed under the bill of sale by the defendant This 
was communicated to the attorney and the judgment 
creditor, and the officer thereupon withdrew. 

The insolvent, however, remained in possession until the 
arrest of the insolvent under a ca. sa. at the suit of the same 
creditor. Under that ca. ea. he went to prison, and on that 
imprisonment proceeded the insolvency under which the 
assignees now claimed the goods as having been in ** the 
order and disposition of the insolvent&quot; with the consent 
of the true owner, the defendant. 




NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 569 

On the other hand, it was contended that the claim 1861. 
under the fi. fa. known to the creditor and his attorney, 
took the case out of reputed ownership, as against the 
* assignees. 

The^ defendant was called, but his son-in-law, the in- 
solvent, was not. 

The defendant swore that, on the 28th July, the day 
before the officer entered under the^./a., he bad put a 
man in possession, although he permitted the insolvent to 
have the use of the goods. 

There was no evidence that any creditor did not know 
of the bill of sale. 

Martin, B., without leaving any question of fact to 
the jury, told them that the claim to the goods before the 
insolvency, known to one of the creditors and to the 
attorney, and to the sheriff&apos;s officer, was notice to all the 
creditors, and the assignees, of the real ownership, which 
prevented, as against them, at all events, any reputed 
ownership from arising, so that they could not recover. 
And he told the jury that they must find for the de-

(a) Reported by J. B. Rowley, Esq. 




WESTERN CIRCUIT. 671 

General Highway Act, favours this part of the argument. 1861. 
Wicket gates and stiles are common on footways, which 
exclude by their very existence any notion of wheel 
carriages. A perambulator, though small and light enough 
to be carried, is intended to be wheeled, and with its three 
wheels may make indentations on the ground wherever it 
goes. If a perambulator be admitted on a footway, where 
is the line to be drawn, as to what carriages shall be ex- 
cluded from it— could butchers&apos; and bakers&apos; handcarts be 
excluded ? When a man had granted a right of way on 
foot over his property, it was going beyond his grant to use 
hand carnages or carts. The perambulator, in this case, 
was a small one adapted for one child. But supposing a 
large one capable of holding several, would that be 
excluded, if this were admitted ? Is the time of the Courts 
to be occupied by discussions as to the precise limits of 
size and weight, at which these vehicles may, or may not, 
be used. The question is one of law for the Court. • 

Karslake for the prosecution. — ^The question is a mixed 
one of law and fact for the jury. There is no English autho- 
rity on the subject, but in the second edition of Gale on 
Easements (a), there is a reference to the civil law, in which 
a right vehiculum ducere is spoken of, but the manner in 
which it was exercised does not appear. There arc 
privileges appertaining to the use of a footway. It is clear 
that a person may use a stick, or carry a parcel, or basket, 
or drag one along the ground after him. It is to be presumed 
that the dedicator intended that the public should have the 
enjoyment of the right in the ordinary and usual way. A 
perambulator is not a carriage in the ordinary sense of the 
word. It is used by a pedestrian, and may be taken up 
and carried, as it was here on the occasion of the assault 
Such a vehicle may be reasonably used on a footway. As 

(a) Page 201. 




672 CASES ON THE 

1S61. well might the defendant object to a child wheeling its toy 
cart along the footway. It is admitted that vehicles of 
this description are in common use throughout the country. 
There is no sufficient reason for excluding their use on a 
footway dedicated to the public. 

Byles, J.— As at present advised, I think this is a mixed 
question of law and fact, and that it must go to the jury. 
Ify however, the Court should be of opinion that the ques- 
tion is for me, and that I ought to have decided it for the 
defendant, I reserve leave to move. 

After Montague Smith liad addressed the jury for the 
defendant, 

Btlbs, J. (summing up). — This case involves the 
proper mode of using a footway, and the question for your 
consideration upon this indictment is, was this perambulator 
a vehicle, the use of which would justify the defendant in 
removing it, and assaulting the prosecutrix for that purpose. 
It is a question of general importance, because it may 
apply, not merely to this particular footway in Clifton, but 
to all the footways in the kingdom, including those in 
large and populous towns. The defendant was armed 
with a double set of rights upon this occasion. First, he 
had, as one of the public, a right to remove a nuisance to 
the highway, and next, as owner of the soil, he had a right 
to remove anything encumbering it. As to the first, sup- 
pose the case of a ferocious dog, or wheel carriage, used 
by horses, or a steam carriage on a footway, as a jury 
would probably find these to be nuisances, any one of the 
public would have a right to remove them. But there 
might be many things on a footway which ought not to be 
there, but not being nuisances, interfering with the conve- 
nient use of the way by passengers, one of the public would 
have no right to remove. If you should think that this 
perambulator ought not to have been tiicre, but that it did 




WESTERN CIRCUIT. 673 

not aroouDt to a nuisance to the way, the defendant, as one 1861. 
of the public, had no right to remove it But next, he is 
owner of the soil, and as such has a larger right than one 
of the public merely would have. For as owner of the 
soil of the footway he had a right to remove, not only 
nuisances to the way, but anything thereon, the presence of 
which was not justified by the nature of the easement. 
The easement in this case is a public right of &apos;&apos; footway.&quot; 
But it is not easy to furnish a definition of that word. It 
cannot certainly be taken literally. 

But to go a little further. There are what are called 
go-carts, consisting of three sticks, with very small wheels, 
the child&apos;s feet touching the ground, and propelling itself, 
or being propelled. Would this be a proper use of a foot- 
way ? Or take the cases already put, of a toy-carriage, or 
horse on wheels. A man might probably carry another 
along a footway, but a woman might certainly carry a 
child. And, if so, may she not put it in a go-cart or per- 
ambulator ? My direction to you is, that the owner of 
the soil may remove anything that encumbers his close, 
except such things as are usual accompaniments of a large 
class of foot passengers, being so small and light, as 
neither to be a nuisance to other passengers or injurious 
to the soil. I do not by this imply that he may remove 
things that are large. It is difficult to draw the line, and 
I don&apos;t intend to do so, as it is not necessary that I should. 
I confine myself to the present case. If you are of opinion 
that this perambulator comes within the description of the 
things, as to which I have just directed you, you will find 
for the prosecution, if not for the defendant. 

The jury retired, but could not agree. On their return 
they requested an explanation of the word &quot; nuisance.&quot; 

Byles, J. — A nuisance to a way is that which prevents 
the convenient use of the way by passengers. — [A Juror. 
I don&apos;t object to them, but I think the owner of the soil

must take the law from me. If you find that this 
perambulator was within the description I mentioned, I 
tell you as matter of law he had no right to object. I will 
put the propositions separately. 

1. As to its being a usual accompaniment. 

2. As to the size and weight, with reference to nuisance. 

3. As to its injuring the soil. 
The jury again retired, and on their return said that they 

had only agreed to the affirmative of the first proposition. 

Bylbs, J. — Now you have said so, I will say there 
is really no doubt at all about it. 

Ultimately the jury not agreeing were discharged, being, 
it was said, equally divided.

The plaintiff claimed, as mortgagee of Edward Done,

John Done, in 1823, devised the property to his son 
John, as the plaintiff alleged, in fee tail, who had devised 
the property to two persons named Heath and Eardley, 
in trust for the benefit of Edward Done and his issue. 
The defendant was the heir at law of the testator, and dis-

that enactment (a)y and its only object being to remedy a 
mere mistake as to the names^ not to cause a new title. 



in ejectment (unless it be s. 221), 
there is no power to amend at the 
trial at all in such case, unless 
either under these clauses or the 
clause just referred to, which pro- 
vides, that the several Courts and 
Judges shall and may exercise over 
the proceedings the like jurisdic- 
tion as heretofore exercised in the 
action of ejectment, so as to ensure 
a trial of the title. Before the 
C. L. P. Act, there was a power of 
amending by introducing demises 
by other parties, and there must at 
least be as great a power now. 
Before the act it was no doubt held 
that, under the stat. 3&amp;4 Will. 4, 
c. 42, s. 23 (still unrepealed), the 
Court could not amend by striking 
out the name of the wife in a joint 
demise by her husband and herself, 
but the reason given was, that it 
would be in fact amending the title, 
or the name of the plaintiff, for it 
would appear from the record that 
the husband only claimed in right 
of his \rife ; and the defendants 
came to contest that the wife had 
the legal estate : whereas, by the 
amendment, he would claim it in 
his own right: and so on some 
title totally different ( Doe d. Wilton 
V. Beck, 22 L. J., C. P. 6), and 
the v.ery reason for the decision 
implies that even under ihatjormer 
act, still in force, the Judges have 
the power of striking out or adding 
names of parties, provided the 
variance is not ** material to the 
merits.&quot; At all events, that case 
only shows that the amendment 



could not be made under thai 
statute, where it evaded the ques- 
tion the parties came to try, and 
introduced a wholly new title. 
Nor, under the present act, could 
that be done, either by amending 
to the extent of getting rid of the 
parties (plaintiffs) on the record 
altogether, or altering them so as 
to bring in a new title, not the 
title which the parties came to try. 
For it has been held that the names 
of parties cannot in nay action be 
altered, if it appears that the non- 
joinder or misjoinder was not by 
mutak€f but by design, &apos;^o try the 
right ( Wickens v. Steel, 26 L. J., 
C. P. 241). And so in ejectment, 
if it appears that the object of the 
insertion or omission of the names 
was to try a question of title, and 
that the object of the amendment 
is to try another and a different 
title, no doubt the application 
would be refused. 

No doubt the sUt 3&amp;4 Will. 4 
does not apply where the amend- 
ment is material to the merits, 
whether or not it is material for 
the ** real question in contro- 
versy between the parties ;&quot; but 
if the question is one of mere 
mistake in a name more or less, 
and the title is the same, it should 
seem not to be material to the 
merits. If, howe.ver, the question 
must be decided on the terms of the 
C. L. P. Act alone, it is to be ob- 
served, that, although it has been 
held that ejectment does not come 
under the term **per9onal actiont&quot;

{Doe d. GUlett v. Roe, 1 C, M.&amp;R. 19), BO that it clearly would 
not come under the^s^ part of the 
C. L. P. Act, where that phrase is 
used. The expression is carefully 
altered in the second part of the 
act, in the preamble to sect. 34, 
&apos;*with respect to the joinder of 
parties to ar f loni r&quot;— &quot; at the trial 
of any action.&quot; And it is to be 
added that the preamble to sect 
41, seems to embrace the action 
of ejectment, which is carefully 
excepted in the enactment itself. 
And so, sect. 46, as to special case, 
seems, for the same reason, to in- 
clude that action. And ejectment 
was held not included in the clauses 
of the Act of 1854, as to equitable 
pleading, simply because there are 
no pleadings in ejectment {Neave 
V. Avety, 16 C. B. 328) ; for which 
reason, of course, the action cannot 
be comprised in that section of the 
Act of 1852, which relates to plead- 
ing. But it clearly is included in 
all the other sections as to notice to 
produce and admit, trial, judgment, 
execution, and the like. And so 
in the Act of 1854, as to discovery 
or interrogatory, and the procedure 
at fiMt prtm. The scope of the 
C. L. P. Act seems to be first to 
give such enactments as are appli* 
cable to all actions, and then such 
as are peculiar to paWioi^r actions. 
For which reason there is no par^ 



tkular provision as to amendment 
in ejectment, by adding or omitting 
parties, except as aforesaid* So 
that it should seem either under 
the old jurisdiction of the Courts, 
or under the act of 3&amp;4 Will. 4, or 
under the above enactment, there 
if power to add or omit names of 
plaintiffs in ejectment, provided it 
does not alter the title to be tried. 

(u) If it shall appear to the 
Judge that such misjoinder or non- 
joinder was not for the purpose of 
obtaining undue advantage, and 
that injustice will not be done by 
such amendment, and that the 
person or persons to be added con- 
sent (either in person or by writing) 
to be so joined, or that the person 
or persons to be struck out were 
originally introduced without their 
consent, or that they consent to be 
struck out,&amp;e. The &apos;* injustice &quot; 
here, it is obvious, must mean In- 
justice to the defendant^ for the 
plaintiffs on the record apply ; and 
the parties to be added must conseni. 
And the injustice to defendant 
must mean such injtutice as pointed 
out in the cases cited supra, of 
being suddenly called upon to meet 
a new title, and try a different 
question from that which he came 
to try; which cannot be, if there 
was even a mere mittakef and the 
title is the same. See Wkkent v. 
Ste ,26L. J., C.P.241.

Grove did not assent to this ; and 

Bramwell, B., said he should allow the amendmeDt 
by adding the names of the trustees^ reserving the question 
of costs. 

Grove objected that there would then be a misjoinder, 
aSy if the legal estate was in the trustees, Blake ought not 
to be joined, and his name should be struck out, the 
result of which would be an entire substitution of the 
trustees for Biake, which was not within the power of 
amendn)ent given by the Common Law Procedure Acty 
1862. 

Bramwbll^ B., said he should make the amendment. 

The defendant&apos;s case was then gone into, and the main 
question was left to the jury, who found a 

Verdict for the pIaintifF(a). 



(a) In Sawyer y. Ottley, I Post.&amp;Fin. 037, Erlb C. J., allowed 
an amendment to be made, at the 
trial of an action of ejectment, by 
adding the name of a person having 
a joint legal interest with the plain- 
tiff Here, however, Blake, the 
only original plaintifi^ had no legal 
interest at all. The writ, however, 
may contain the names of all the 
parties in whom the title is supposed 
to be, and verdict be entered for 
&quot; some one or other of them &quot; 
(C. L. P. Act, 1852, sect 169), and 
here Blake&apos;s name was not struck 
out, so that the action continued 
to be by Blake, and the only amend- 
ment required or made was by 
addition. The scope of the C. L. 
P. Act, as to amendment at the 
trial, seems to be to allow at the 
trial such amendments as might 
take place before trial ; as to which 
the general principle is laid down 



(as regards other actions) in Gibaon 
V. Varley, 26 L. J., Q. B. 79, vit, 
that names of plaintifis may be 
added to remedy mistake in the 
name*, and to carry out the original 
intention of the plaintiff. And 
this is the principle applied to all 
other amendments ( Wickem v. 
Steei, 26 L. J., C. P. 241). The 
question whether there is any power 
in ejectment to amend by adding 
at the trial names of plaintiffs 
omitted by mistake, is quite distinct 
from that of amending so as to 
raise a different title. The title of 
cestui que trust is in equity the 
same as his trustees, and in law 
their titles are not adverse (Gar^ 
wood V. Tuck, 8 C. B. 231). 

In M. T., Grove got a rule fiisi 
in the Exch. but it was dischai^ed.

They were traced walking towards London on the llth^ 
and would have reached London probably on the I2tb| 
the day on which the prisoner, with a foreigner, were 
found entering London, fatigued and in search of washing 
and refreshment, as if they had been out all night. And 
the prisoner&apos;s things were tied with a string, which tallied 
with that found about the corpse, and both pieces were 
identified by the maker, who had sold string to the seller, 
at Reigate, who .had identified the prisoner as the pur- 
chaser of string from him just before the murder. 
The prisoner called no witnesses (a). 

Blackburn, J, — The first question is, has the crime 
been committed? That must be determined before you 
can say whether the prisoner is guilty of it. You will 
hardly have a doubt here that a murder has been com- 
mitted by some one. As matter of law, if you are satisfied 
that when the deceased met her death from violence by any 
person or persons to enable them to commit a burglary (or 
any other felony), although those who inflicted that degree 
of violence might not have intended to kill her (probably 
you think so here, and merely to stop her outcry in calling 
for assistance), all who are parties to that violence are guilty 
of murder. 

You need not take on yourselves the responsibility of 
that. I take that on myself. The great question for you 
is, whether, taking all the circumstances, it is made out to 
your satisfaction that the prisoner was one of those who 
inflicted that violence. 

The whole case turns on circumstantial evidence ; i. c, 
no eyes have witnessed the act. You are to weigh each

On the 12th of Jane, two days after the niurdery the 1861. 
prisoner and another foreigner were in Whitechapel| where 
they went to a lodging-house, and where the other left 
him. 

On the 16th or 17th of June, the prisoner (as it appeared 
by his subsequent statement) had heard that twoGrermans, 
Franz and Kron, were suspected of the murder. 

On the 23rd of June, the prisoner, being in Newgate for 
some offence, was there told of this charge with the usual 
caution, and gave a false name, stating that he had come 
from Hull through Leeds, and had lost his papers. 

On the 27th of June, being brought up for the first time 
on this charge, he gave the false name, and declared he 
had never been at Reigate. 

After a remand, he was brought up again on the 1st 
July, and the discovery of the pocket-book,&amp;c. was stated 
in his presence. On the 8th he was brought up again, 
after a week&apos;s remand ; and, after hearing all the evi- 
dence, he made a stateoient (a). He declared that he was 
thus robbed both of his pocket-book and ** pass,&quot; his papers, 
and some of his clothes ; and he accounted for his identi- 
fication by suggesting that the murderer had worn his 
coat and dropped his pocket-book and papers on the 
spot. 

He said one of the foreigners was called Kron, and 
among the papers found in his pocket-book was a letter to 
Kron. 

He did not in his statement make any allusion to the 
foreigner with whom he had gone to the lodging-house on 
the 12th June. 

Many witnesses swore to seeing two foreigners at or 
near the place about the time of the murder, and identified

Not guilty (a). 



(a) This case, apart from the 
question of law as to constructive 
murder, is one of the most remark- 
able instances of presumptive evi* 
dence, as to wbich Hale says, *&lt;In 
some cases presumptive evidences 
go far to prove a person guilty, 
though there be no express proof of 
the fact to be committed by him, 
but then it must be vety warily 
prestedy for it is better that five 
guilty persons should escape un- 
punished, than that one innocent 
person should die (vol. ii. 288) 
And it is remarkable that the illus- 
tration which Hale gives, is that of 
a man, who was found with stolen 
goods in his possession, soon after 
the robbery, and, not being able to 
account for their possession was 
condemned and executed, whereas 
in fact, as it afterwards turned out, 
the real robber had passed the 
stolen property to him, under some 
pretext, in order to facilitate his 
own escape. This was precisely 



the defence set up in Reg, ▼. 
Manzano, ( Vide ante, p. 64.) 

With regard to the point of law 
as to which the learned Judge di- 
rected the jury, it will be observed, 
that he implied that the prisoner 
must either actively or passively 
have been a party, not only to the 
burglary, but the personal injury, 
and did not put the case on the old 
doctrine laid down in Hale (vol. i. 
439) but long since exploded, that 
the merely being a party to a bur- 
glary, even though absent from the 
actual scene of violence, may, in 
the event of death ensuing, make 
the crime of murder. The learned 
Judge, however, laid it down, that 
although neither party had the 
design to kill, and the evidence (as 
he appeared to think) clearly in- 
dicated they had not, yet the vio- 
lence being unlawful, and in the 
prosecution of a felony, and death 
ensuing, the offence amounted to 
murder.

to amount to absolute deprivation of necessaries, nor any authority°&gt;n

had left voluntarily. They put themselves under the pro- 
tection of the plaintiff, an attorney, who opened a commu- 
nication with the defendant on their behalf. He then de- 
nied that he had been married to the lady, and disclaimed 
all responsibility for her, but entered into negotiations as 
to a provision for her and her daughter, on condition of the 
latter separating from her. The daughter, however, refused 
either to separate from her mother or to return to her father, 




686 CASES ON THE

had been making advances to the ]ady and her daughter 
for their support, which the daughter proved, the money 
having been chiefly paid to her^ though she stated that it 
bad been applied and expended by her mother for their 
joint support. It did not appear distinctly that the defend- 
ant had been informed of these advances, but it rather 
appeared that he was aware that some advances were being 
made during the negotiations, and in February, when the 
negotiations were broken off, he declared that he would 
not sanction advances, except on condition of the daughter 
leaving her mother. The money paid into Court was suffi- 
cient to satisfy these advances. But they went on up to 
shortly before action, and to the amount of nearly 180/., at 
the rate of about 5/. a week. 

Early, however, in the course of the communications, 
the plaintiff informed the defendant that they were main- 
tained at his cost, but, except on the condition before 
mentioned, the defendant never assented to their being so 
maintained, and on cross-examination his daughter ad- 
mitted that the plaintiff had so stated to her, that her 
father had declared he would not assent to it. It further 
appeared that the daughter and her brother were entitled 
to some property, and that the plaintiff had taken an 
assignment of the brother&apos;s reversionary interest for the 
advances. The letters contained no authority to the 
plaintiff to make advances, beyond what is above stated. 
The mother was not called, nor was the plaintiff, and the 
case rested on the evidence of the daughter, and the letters, 
in proof of a conversation in which the defendant&apos;s former 
attorney was informed that the plaintiff was providing for 
his wife and daughter, and stated that he was sure the 
defendant would act honourably. This, however, was 
merely in the course of the negotiations. 

It appeared, also, that the lady had stated she had an 
allowance of 80/. a year from a former husband.

HOME CIRCUIT. 687 

At the close of the case for the plaintiff, there being no 1861. 
actual proof of a marriage, 

JBovill submitted that there roust be a nonsuit. — Even 
assuming that the lady is the wife of the defendant (though 
there is no proof that she is), she was a wife living apart 
from her husband, and with a separate maintenance. There 
is no authority implied, even to contract for necessaries, 
under these circumstances, but this is not an action for 
necessaries, nor by the person who supplied her, but it is 
an action for money lent to her ; and there is no authority 
in a wife, living apart from her husband, to borrow money 
on his credit. There is here no attempt to show an actual 
authority, and there is no implied authority, at all events 
beyond the time up to which the money is paid into Court. 
Moreover, there is no evidence that the advances were 
made on the credit of the defendant, and there is evidence 
that they were no/, but upon the credit of the son*s rever- 
sionary interest. 

M, Chambers for the plaintiff. — There is evidence that 
the defendant turned his wife out of doors, and there is an 
authority implied in law to contract for what is necessary. 

Williams, J. — The action is not for necessaries, nor is 
it brought by a person who has supplied necessaries. 
There is no proof of any authority to borrow money, be- 
yond the time up to which money is paid into Court. 

Chambers. — The defendant knew that they must be 
supported somehow, and that they were being supported 
by the plaiutiff. That is suflBcient as an authority. 

BovilL — There is no proof of any turning out of doors. 
On the contrary, it is alleged that they left voluntarily. 
There is no proof of ill-usage, and they refused to return 
to him. 

Williams, J. — I am of opinion that there is no case. 
But then there is the issue on the plea, denying that she 
is his wife. I cannot direct a verdict on that, and unless

On the 24th April, 1860, the plaintiff, an aged female,

severe iniuries. Her original statement was that her feet •• 

. .1 II 1 LiL The London 

had caught, but her evidence now tended to show that both and 

heel and toe had caught, and so she had been tripped up. ^li^^^^ 
The case on her part was that the stairs of deal had been Company. 
lately mended with slips of oak nailed on the front of each 
step, which being stronger than deal, and therefore less 
worn, left a kind of groove on each step, in which the 
toe of the foot was likely to catch, while the heel was likely 
to catch on the projection of the oak slip on the preceding 
step. And several witnesses, some of whom had them- 
selves fallen in the same way, gave evidence to this effect. 

There was evidence that the steps had been on the 
morning in question somewhat wet, dirty, and slippery, 
by reason of the weather. 

Witnesses were called to show that the steps had been 
repaired in the usual manner ; and on the other side, to 
show that they should have been all of one wood, or faced 
with zinc. 

Williams, J. (to the jury). — The question is, whether 
the injury was owing to the steps being in an improper 
condition, by reason of the negligence of the Company. 

It is not enough that the stairs were of improper con- 
struction, or repaired in a mean or improper manner, un- 
less they were of such a construction, or in such a con- 
dition, through the fault of the Company, as would be 
likely to, and did, cause the plaintiff to fall down them. 
And you must be satisfied, before you find for her, that 
they were in such a state, through their fault, that by 
reason of that she fell as she has described.

The steward was the chief witness for the plaintiff, and 
stated that it was his duty to examine the meat, and 
report it if bad, and that to his knowledge no bad meat 
had been received from the plaintiff, though he admitted 
the fact of some complaints, and also of* one or two boys

On the 1 9th September, I860, the contract between the

60/. was to be paid on signing the agreement, 300/. on the 
houses being roofed in, and 300/. on the floors being laid, 
and 200/. on the completion. 

On the same day the defendant wrote to the plaintiff the 
guarantee declared on : — &apos;^ Mr. Leddiatt has contracted to 
build for me two houses for 860/., and I guarantee to pay 
to you, on the production of his orders, 200/. ; 100/. out of

Leddiatt must be entitled to his second draw, and there- 
fore that the first instalment of 100/. was due. 

On the 28th March the defendant wrote to the plaintiff,

In May this action was brought 

The defendant was called, and he swore that afler the 
sale Leddiatt had nothing to do with the work, and that he 
bad completed it himself, at a greater expense than the 
contract price. But he admitted that it was completed in 
a better manner; and it appeared that Leddiatt had given 
some kind of assistance in the way of advice or suggestion 
while the houses were being completed. 

On the part of the plaintiff the case was, that the 
transfer of the work and plant by Leddiatt was merely 
colourable, and it appeared that the bricks had been

xHE plaintiff sued as public officer of the London 
and County Banking Company, and the declaration stated 
that on the 23rd July, 1856, in consideration that the Bank- 
ing Company would advance to one E. Smith, 6,000/., from 
time to time,as he should require, the defendant promised the 
Banking Company that he would guarantee and hold them 
harmless from any loss that might arise to them, in conse- 
quence of such advances, and that it should be a continuing 
guarantee, to the extent of 6,000/. 

Averment, that the co-partnership, relying on the 
guarantee, afterwards advanced to Smith divers sums, 
amounting to 6,000/., and that in consequence of such 
advances a loss had arisen to them to that amount. 

Breach : that the defendant had not held them harmless 
from the loss. 

Plea : for a defence on equitable grounds — ^that E. Smith, 
when the defendant gave the guarantee, carried on business 
as a contractor, and kept a banking account with the co- 
partnership, and owed them a large sum. That the defendant 
also kept an account with the co-partnership, and had a 
large sum in their hands. That it was proposed that the 
defendant should become a partner of Smith in his said 
business, and that Smith represented to the defendant that 
he had large and lucrative contracts in hand, and wanted 
capital to carry them out, and that he owed the co-partner- 
ship a sum of 18,000/., and he referred the defendant to the 
co-partnership and to the plaintiff, as the manager, in order 
that the defendant might make inquiries from him as to 
the pecuniary affairs of Smith, and the state of his account 
and his liabilities. That thereupon he applied to and 
made inquiries of the said co-partnership, and of the plain- 
tiff as such manager, for the purpose of ascertaining the

know whether he dealt in them extensively. And that he

The defendant began, and being called in support 
of his f)lea, stated that having, in June, 1866, been intro- 
duced to Smith, and a partnership being proposed, and 
both banking with the plaintiff&apos;s co-partnership, it was 
agreed that they should mutually make inquiries there ; 
and accordingly the defendant applied to the plaintiff for 
information, when the plaintiff made the statements set 
forth in the declaration. In addition thereto, the plaintiff

Netley, for which the plaintiff said the bank had agreed to 
advance him 5,000/. The defendant foand that Smith 
had eight contracts on hand at Pembroke, Netley, Ports- 
mouth, Shoreham and other places, which the defendant 
visited, and inspected the works, and where he was 
satisfied as to the value of the contracts. Soon after his 
return from this inspection, he saw the plaintiff and in- 
formed him of this, and of this disposition to form a part- 
nership. He also saw Smith and inspected his balance 
sheet, whence it appeared that (as the plaintiff had stated) 
he was worth 24,000/. 

On the 7th July, 1856, after all this, the defendant lent 
Smith 2,000/., taking his promissory note for the amount 

Shortly afterwards the Netley contract was put into 
defendant&apos;s hands to conduct, and he lent Smith 2,000/. 
more. 

The defendant continued in charge of the Netley con- 
tract until September, 1857, when it was completed. 

On the 23rd July, 1856, the defendant saw the plaintiff, 
who said the bank wanted him to give a guarantee, as 
otherwise they should stop advances to Smith. Defendant&apos;s 
version of the interview was, that he told plaintiff that 
the partnership was not formed, and that he asked, if it 
went off, how the guarantee was to be dealt with? to 
which the plaintiff replied, ^* If the partnership does not 
go on, we will give back the guarantee,&quot; and that the 
defendant on that understanding then gave the guarantee, 
which was as follows : —

that may arise to you in consequence of such advances, issi 
and tHis shall be to you a continuing guarantee to the 
extent of 6,000/.&quot; 

The defendant, as already mentioned, was in charge of 
the Netley contract until September, 1867, when it was 
completed. 

On the 4th October, 1866, the defendant lent Smith 
2,000/. more, taking another note. 

On the 4th November, 1866, the defendant being at the 
bank, the plaintiff complained that the partnership was 
not confirmed, and intimated that Smith&apos;s account had 
increased to 25,000/., that there was another large sum 
owing, a covered debt of 26,000/. According to the de- 
fendant&apos;s account, this was the first he had heard of the 
covered debt, as additional to the uncovered debt, and that 
he told the plaintiff so, who however denied it. 

In January, 1867, the defendant employed an attorney 
to look into the matter. 

Further interviews took place between the parties, but 
the partnership was not confirmed. 

On the 21st April, 1 867, the plaintiff wrote to the de- 
fendant to know when it would be completed, and the 
defendant replied by a letter to the effect that the valuation 
of the stock was going on, and would necessarily take a 
long time, and that the affair could not be hastily con- 
cluded. 

In September the Netley contract was completed. 

On the 6th October, 1867, Smith died, and it turned 
out that he was insolvent. 

Shortly before this the defendant was present at a 
meeting of the directors, at which the guarantee was 
alluded to, and the defendant mentioned his impression of 
the oral agreement with the plaintiff, that if the partner- 
ship did not take effect, the guarantee should be given up, 
which the plaintiff denied.

particulars of all securities,&amp;c. And the plaintiff there-

Securities were specified, and among others the defend- 
ant&apos;s guarantee. 

On the 6th October Smith died, as already mentioned, 
the partnership not having been completed. 

On the 18th October, 1857, the defendant wrote to the 
bank to the effect that as the guarantee was to be given 
up, if the partnership did not take effect, and Smith had 
died, he demanded that it should be returned. 

The bank denied the statement, and declined to give up 
the guarantee. 

It did not appear that the defendant up to this time 
had complained of the alleged misrepresentation by the 
plaintiff as to the state of Smith&apos;s account. 

The bank took proceedings in Chancery for the adminis- 
tration of Smith&apos;s estate, and proved for upwards of 
60,000/. 

In May, 1861, they wrote to the defendant to the effect 
that the result of the administration had not been to re- 
duce the debt to less than 5,000/., and that therefore 
they must call on the defendant to can*y out his guarantee. 
He refused, and the present action was brought 




HOME CIRCUIT. 699 

The plaintiff was called, and contradicted defendant, 1861 
both as to the alleged misrepresentation and the alleged 
undertaking to return the guarantee. 

As to the former, he stated that the sum of 18,000/. 
was mentioned merely as the current account, apart from 
the loan or &apos;^ covered*&apos; account. 

As to the alleged undertaking to return the guarantee, 
the plaintiff denied it in toto, and stated that on the faith 
of it advances had been made to Smith far beyond 5,000/. 

The plaintiff&apos;s version of the matter was, that on the 
23rd July, 1856, he told the defendant that the directors 
had already allowed Smith to overdraw largely, and would 
not allow him to overdraw further without a guarantee, 
and that on the guarantee being given, he, the plaintiff, 
told the defendant, that it would be fair that it should 
rank after the amount to which they had already allowed 
him to overdraw. And the plaintiff said, that on the 
faith of the guarantee Smith had been allowed to over- 
draw until the debt on the current account reached 
25,000/., of which the defendant had been made aware. 

There was no proof that the statement of Smith&apos;s affairs 
had been seen by the defendant, though it had been sent 
to his attorney. 

The defendant was not asked, whether, if he had known 
the state of Smith&apos;s affairs, he would have given the 
guarantee. 

The attorney for the defendant being called, Bovill^ in 
cross-examining, asked him when he first heard of the 
guarantee, whereupon 

Chambers asked from whom he heard it ; and the answer 
being, that he heard it from his client, the defendant, 
proposed to ask, &apos;&apos;What did he say to you at the time? &quot; 

Bovill objected to the question, and 

Williams, J., disallowed it. 

The attorney for the plaintiff being called, denied, in 




600 CASES ON THE 

1861. the course of cross-examination, that the attorney for the 
defendant had told him at a certain time that bis client 
had complained of misrepresentation, whereupon 

Chambers proposed to recal his client&apos;s attorney to con- 
tradict this. 

JBovill objected that it would be collateral, but 

Williams, J., thought otherwise, as it bore upon the 
main subject of inquiry ; the contention on the part of the 
plaintiff being, that the alleged misrepresentation was a 
mere afterthought 

The plaintiff admitted that, before June, 1857, the de- 
fendant had reproached him with not having given the 
state of Smith&apos;s affairs correctly, but not that he had 
declared that he had given his guarantee on the faith of 
that statement, and the defendant himself was not asked 
that question. 

Williams, J. (to the jury). — The defence consists of two 
parts, and it is for you to say whether either or both, or 
neither, are made out. As to the first, you will have to 
say whether either the plaintiff made the alleged mis- 
representation as to the state of the banking account, and 
whether the defendant, by reason of it, was induced to 
enter into the guarantee. And, upon the second point, 
consider and state, separately and distinctly, whether there 
was the alleged undertaking that the guarantee should be 
returned, in the event of the partnership not taking 
place. 

The evidence of the defendant seems to me to make out 
the plea in both its parts. It is for you whether you can 
rely upon it. And, if you believe the plaintiff, the plea is 
disproved. 

Nothing is said by the defendant as to the alleged mis- 
representation until the conversation with the plaintifl) 
shortly before the interview with him before the directors, 
when he reproached him with it ; and even then he does 




HOME CIRCUIT. b-Ql 

not appear to have said that he had given the guarantee on 1861. 
the faith of the plaintiflTs statement. And, in answer to 
the letter of the directors after Smith&apos;s death, the defendant 
makes no mention of the alleged misrepresentation. The 
defendant&apos;s attorney was recalled to prove some previous 
complaints about it, but they were quite general, and do 
not appear to have amounted to what is now set up, viz., 
that the defendant was induced to enter into the contract 
by the misrepresentation of the plaintiff. 

You must say — 

1st. Whether there was the misrepresentation alleged 
by the defendant, and whether he was by reason of it in- 
duced to give the guarantee. 

2nd. Whether the guarantee was given on condition to 
be returned, if the partnership went off. 

During the absence of the jury, the learned Judge said : 
&apos;&apos; Supposing the jury find that there was not the mUrepre^ 
sentation, but that there was the conditioUf I shall reserve 
the point whether the plea is proved or whether it is a bad 
plea (a), because I doubt if it is good. It is a double plea, 
and the inclination of my mind is that, if the latter part of 
it stood alone, it would be bad. So that, if the jury find 
that latter part alone for the defendant, I shall give the 
plaintiff leave to move to enter the verdict (6). I have grave 
doubts whether the plea would disclose a good defence on 
equitable grounds, if the former part of it, as to the alleged 
representation, were struck out or disproved, leaving only 
the latter part — that it was understood that the guarantee 
should be returned if the partnership should not take effect 
I very much doubt if that would be a good defence whether 
at law or equity. Indeed, I doubt whether, in this case, 
there would be any difference between law and equity. In 
the case of a surety, the only difference between law and

the surety is established, and that a Court of Equity will 
protect that equity. But I haye yet to learn that there is 
any difference between law and equily^ as to terms or eSect 
of a written instrument. Therefore/ I have much doubt 
whether the plea is good without the ^«&lt;part of it; so 
that, if the jury find that part disproved, the plaintiff 
should have leave to move to enter the verdict. 

^ovtU contended that the plea must be proved tn toto. 
He also contended that, in the event of the jury finding 
for the plaintiff, he was entitled to interest (at the rate 
mentioned in the statement of Smith*8 affairs) from the 
date of the guarantee, and which would amount to 9581 
And for this purpose he should, if necessary, apply to 
amend the declaration by increasing the claim from 6,0001. 
to 6,000/. 

Williams, J., said he did not see that the plaintiff 
would be entitled to it, there having been no letter claiming 
interest ; but he would reserve the point if it turned out to 
be material 

The jury found, 1. That there was no wilful misrepre- 
sentation. 

2. That the guarantee was not induced by any mis- 
representation. 

3. That there was not sufficient evidence to show that 
the guarantee was given conditionally. 

In answer to the learned Judge, they said that they 
meant there was no misrepresentation at all.

BROWNLOW AND OTHERS V. THE METROPOLITAN 
BOARD OF WORKS and JOHN AIRD. 

X HIS was an action against the Board of Works and their 
contractor, jointly, for alleged negligence in the course of 
the execution of certain works on the Thames. 

The first count stated that the defendants wrongfully 
placed, in a certain common navigable river, and highway, 
viz., the River Thames, certain piles and pieces of timber, 
and works, and wrongfully kept the same therein, and 
thereby greatly obstructed the due and proper navigation 
of the river, by reason whereof the plaintiffs&apos; ship then 
lawfully navigating the river, ran and struck upon the 
piles, kc, and was by reason thereof greatly injured,&amp;c. 

Second count, that the plaintifis were lawfully possessed 
of a ship, then lawfully navigating a certain common public 
navigable river, and the defendants were constructing cer- 
tain works in and upon the bed of the river, and in a part 
of the river along which ships were in the habit of navi- 
gating, and had a right to navigate ; which said works 
interfered with the free navigation of the river; of which 
the defendants had notice. 

Averment, that the defendants so negligently conducted 
themselves in the construction of the works, and so care- 
lessly constructed them, without taking due and proper 
precautions to protect ships passing along the river, and so 
carelessly omitted to indicate to ships the existence and 
extent of the works, that by reason thereof the ship of the 
plaintiffs, while navigating the river, struck upon the works, 
and was injured,&amp;c.

Chambers, Denman, and Raymond for the Board of

In 1859 the Board resolved, under the powers of their 
acts, to make a new outlet for a certain sewer, and carry it 
out 200 feet into the Thames, by means of an iron pipe, 
laid in the bed of the stream, protected by wooden piles. 

They entered into a contract with the defendant Aird to 
do the works ; he to be responsible for ih^ protection of the 
works, and all needful precautions, in the way of lighting, 
fencing, and the like. 

The act provided that no work, in the bed of the river, 
below low water-mark, which might interfere with the 
navigation of the river, should be commenced, without the 
same having been previously approved of by the Commis- 
sioners of the Admiralty, which had not been obtained ; but 
which, it was alleged by the defendants, was not required 
in this instance, because (as their case was) the work did 
710^ &quot; interfere with the navigation&quot; of the river. 

One of the defendant&apos;s witnesses, however, admitted that 
it did, and so the jury found. 

The act also provided that no person should work in or 
upon the bed or shore of the river (&apos;&apos;shore&apos;* being defined 
to mean between high and low water-mark), or to drive any 
piles therein, or in the river, without the permission of the 
conservators.

1861. The plans laid before the consenrators by the Board, and 

BaowKLo&lt;^Ppro¥ed of, showed that piles were to be driven into the 

and Othen river, and where; the Thames conservancy having seen the 

Tbe Metso- plan of the works, including the ptles, approved thereof, 

subject to the condition, that the piles should be cut off 

level with the foreshore. 

The defendant Aird proceeded with the works, and in 
the progress thereof fixed certain piles in the bed of tbe 
river, to protect the sewer pipe. After this, the plaintiffs&apos; 
vessel, a steamer, going down the river, with a barge 
and spars lashed to her side, was steered over the piles, 
grounded and settled down on them, and was much 
damaged thereby. 

There was a great contest of evidence as to whether, or 
how far, the piles came above the water, or how&amp;r they 
were visible. 

It was suggested that the grounding on the piles was 
owing to the negligence of the master, in sailing over them. 

There was no barge, buoy, or other signal to indicate the 
piles, nor had the master noticed the works. 

The case for the plaintiffs was, that, but for the piles, the 
vessel would jiave grounded on soft mud, and have gone 
off with the next tide, without any material injury, but 
that, as it was, the ship&apos;s bottom became fixed, and fastened 
on the piles, and thus the water went over her, and the 
serious injuries ensued. 

The plaintiffs&apos; witnesses stated that, even if they had 
known of the piles, they could not have got the vessel off; 
but she would have swung round on the bank. 

There was a contest whether the steamer should have 
steered inside a certain tier of vessels, and also whether 
the spars had not obstructed the steerage. 

To fix the Board (it being proved by their own letters, 
that the defendant Aird was their contractor) a foreman of 
Aird&apos;s was called, who proved that he had worked for Aird

trad drawings. 

It appeared that the sewer pipe running out into the ■n*^ Others 
river was sunk into the bed of it, between the piles which The Metro- 
were on each side of it, and the heads of which were cut &apos;boariT 
oflF to the level of the ground, on each side of the pipe, ^^ 
and somewhat above the pipe. and 

The working drawings attached to the contract showed 
that piles were to be driven in. 

The acts of parliament allowed this, provided that the 
piles were cut off level with the foreshore, and above low 
water- mark. 

The act required that piles should not be driven in, un- 
less with the approval of the Thames Conservancy Board, 
and the plans approved by the Board showed that piles 
were to be driven in, and where. 

In the course of the plaintiffs&apos; evidence it was disputed 
whether the piles had been driven in according to the plans 
approved of, viz., above low water-mark. 

At the close of the case for the plaintiffs — 
Chambers^ for the Board, objected that there was no case 
against them, it appearing that there was a contract by 
Aird, the co-defendant, as an independent contractor; 
JRapson V. Cubitt (a). 

They therefore are not liable for his negligence, assuming 
that it is so. 

Williams, J. — That depends on whether the contract 
was to do this particular thing (i). Some of the cases 
show, indeed, that, if there is any negligence collateral to 
the performance of the contract, the employer of the con- 
tractor would not be liable. If, however, I order a man

to put up a post ID the middle of a highway, it is immaterial 
whether the man does it by contract or not. 

Chambers. — But the Board are not bound by the par- 
ticular manner in which the contractor chose to do the 
work. All that appears is, that they ordered the work to 
be done ; i . e., properly done. For anything improperly 
done, they, therefore, are not liable, unless there is proof 
order to do this particular thing. 

Williams, J. — I have a strong opinion that there is 
evidence to go to the jury that the Board employed the co- 
defendant, Aird, by contract, to put down these piles. But 
I will reserve that and all other points of law which may 
arise. 

[Ultimately it appeared to be admitted that in substance 
the piles had been driven in according to the plans.] 

The defendants called evidence to show that the piles 
were properly cut off, and that the pilot was in fault in the 
course he had taken. 

But it appeared, on cross-examination, that, by the plans 
submitted to the Thames Conservancy Board, the piles 
were to be driven in nearer the shore, so that their tops or 
heads would have been visible even at low water ; though 
it did not appear that they would have been plainly seen 
from vessels navigating, and the defendants* witnesses said 
it was usual in cases of sewer works to drive piles into the 
river, the tops of which were about level with low water- 
mark. And this appeared to have been the case in this 
instance. 

Witnesses for the defendants gave it as their opinion, 
that the piles were not an obstruction to the navigation. 

The reason they gave for this opinion was, that the 

heads of the piles, not being above the level of the fore- 

. shore, a vessel drifting over them would not touch them, 

unless it should have touched the ground. (This, it will 

be observed, was not disputed on the part of the plaintiffs,

but it was contended that the soft shore could not have 
injured the vessel as the piles had injured it.) 

The witnesses for the defendants gave it as their opi- 
nion that the vessel should not have been steered so near The Mbtro- 

POLITAN 

the shore, but should have taken a course more towards 
the centre of the river, the proper navigation being nearer 
the mid-channel. 

Williams, J. — That appears to me to be immaterial, 
for the case for the plaintiffs is, that there was a tier of 
vessels which prevented their steamer from taking a course 
nearer the mid-channel, so that the abstract question, 
which U the proper course of navigation, does not really 
arise. The plaintiffs had a right to navigate any part of 
the river, and although the master made an indiscreet 
choice in the course he took, if the defendants have put 
piles into the bed of the river, which prevented him from 
using it, as he would have otherwise been able to do, the 
defendants are answerable, unless they can show that he 
had notice of it. If you put a post up on the highway, 
it is immaterial whether or not the driver took the proper 
course, for, unless he knew of the post, you are answerable 
for the consequences ; though if he saw it or knew of it, 
and drove against it, he would be the author of his own 
injury. Of course, if a man sees a post and drives or 
rides against it, he cannot complain, but if he does not 
see it, even although he is on the wrong side of the road, 
or riding at an imprudent pace, and supposing that had 
nothing to do with his not seeing it. If it appears that 
the plaintiffs were, through the course taken by their 
servant, the master, the authors of their own wrong, of 
course they cannot recover. Some of the defendants&apos; 
witnesses admitted that piles projecting as these did might 
be a nuisance to the navigation, and that if done by a 
stranger, or a private person, for instance, in front of a 
wharf, it would be complained of as a nuisance. There

&quot;&quot;^^^ which must have been heard and seen by masters of

Works ^^^ ^^^ Statutes of course will be reserved for the Court. 

and Upon the statutes, however, some questions of fact arise, 

JohkAird. ; ., , , , 

on the one side and the other. 

For the defendants it is contended, that even though 
there were no act of parliament authorizing these works 
the plaintiffs could not recover, because their servant, the 
master, or pilot, by the course he took, contributed to or 
caused the injury. 

But as to that I have already declared my opinion, 
that negligence in the master is no answer, unless it con- 
tributed to cause the injury; and here I think, that on the 
evidence, it did not do so. Nevertheless that is a ques- 
tion of fact, on which I will take the opinion of the jury. 

Then on the other hand, on the part of the plaintiffs 
it is contended, that even although the act of parliament 
authorized the works, that does not protect the de- 
fendants, because the works were not constructed accord- 
ing to the act, the piles not having been cut off level with the 
foreshore. That raises another question of fact for the jury. 

As regards the point that the Board are not liable, 
because the work was done by a contractor, as it is now 
not disputed, that the piles were driven in according to 
the working drawings and the contract, it makes no dif- 
ference whether the work was done by Aird as contractor, 
or as the servant of the Board, because the exact thing 
they ordered was done. And the only ground on which 
Aird, the contractor, could be liable, as distinguished 
from the Board, would be in not having placed some 
barge or buoy, to mark where the piles were, which will 
cause another question of fact. 

There is also the question, under the statute, whether 



HOME CIRCUIT. 611 

the works interfered with the navigation, which will raise 1861. 
a question of fact for the jury. &quot;&quot; 

On the part of the defendants jointly it was contended, and Others 
that they were not liable, as the Board had acted under the Metro- 
the authority of the acts of parliament, on plans approved &apos;board 
by the Thames Conservancy Board. And on the part&lt;&gt;&apos; 

of the Board it was contended, th&apos;at they at all events and 

were not liable. But, at the close of the case, it did not ^^^^ &apos;*&apos;&apos; 
appetfr to be disputed that the piles had been driven in 
at the place shown by the plans, sanctioned by the Board, 
though it was still contended by the plaintiff, that the 
pile heads ought to have been cut off, and by the Board, 
that for that they were not responsible. 

At the close of the case 

Williams, J. (to the jury). — ^The rule, that a person who 
contributes to his own injury by negligence cannot re- 
cover, has no application here, because the negligence in this 
case was not the proximate cause of the injury. If the 
master had known of the piles, the doctrine would have 
applied. It is not enough to say that if he had not 
steered the vessel there, it would not have grounded on 
the piles (a). 

Still, I will leave the question to you. Was the pilot 
guilty of want of ordinary skill or care in taking the 
course he did ? 

You have also to consider whether the piles interfered 
with the navigation of the river, navigation not meaning 
merely the going up and down the river, but sailing in 
security, so that any one who interferes with the security of 
the navigation, interferes with the navigation. And this 
case is an illustration of that principle ; for if the pilot 
might have grounded the vessel with safety but for the 
piles, they would interfere with the navigation, because 
they interfered with its security and safety. 

I shall likewise leave to you the question whether there

was any neglect of duty in not putting up some buoy or 
signal to mark where the piles were, but I think that 
immaterial, because the pilot, according to the plaintiffs&apos; 
evidence, could not have altered his course, as be was 
powerless to do so, even if he had known of the piles. 

Still it may be better for you to answer, as a matter of 
fact, whether you think there was any duty on the defend- 
ants to give notice of the piles in some way. There ia 
evidence that the conservators were used to give *sach 
notices, and I think there is no evidence of duty in the 
defendants to do so. 

You have further to consider whether the piles were 
driven in above or below low water-mark, with reference 
to the plans as approved of, which show that they were to 
be below. 

There are, therefore, four questions of fact for you : — 

1. Whether the roaster contributed to the accident by 
taking the inside instead of the outside course. (To this 
the jury answered, No.) 

2. Did the works interfere with the navigation ? (An- 
swer. Yes.) 

3. Were the pile-heads cut off level with the foreshore? 
(Answer. They projected from the shore at one end.) 

4. Were they driven above or below high water-mark ? 
(Answer. Three above, one below.) 

5. Was there negligence in not giving notice of the 
piles ? (Jury said, We think that precautionary measures 
ought to have been taken, but there was no evidence by 
whom.) 

Williams, J. — ^That last finding amounts to this, that 
they find no negligence in fact, on thut head, on the part 
of the defendants. It will be matter of law on whom the 
duty lies.

The particulars claimed 104/. 6s. Qd. for the plans and 
estimates, prepared in July, 1660, for the buildings in 
question. 

In March, 1860, a committee being formed for the 
building of the schools, of which committee one of the 
defendants was honorary secretary and the others were 
members, the secretary invited the plaintiffs to send plans 
and estimates of cost. . The letter ran thus : — 

&apos;&apos; They will require accommodation for 100 boys and 
150 girls and infants, with a proper class-room for boys 
and two class-rooms for girls and infants. As it is the 
wish of the committee to introduce the industrial element 
into the schools, the plans for the girls&apos; school should 
embrace a laundry and drying-room, together with a 
small kitchen and bakehouse, and those for the boys a 
carpenter&apos;s shop. Estimates might be added for a proper 
gymnaste apparatus, in the play-ground, and also for a 
bath-room. The boys and girls school-rooms should be so 
planned as to be capable of being thrown into one, and 
available for public meetings. While the committee are 
desirous of having good substantial buildings, of tasteful 
and pleasing exterior, they feel it their duty to avoid any 
unnecessary expense in architectural ornament.&quot; 

A plan of the ground was enclosed, whence it appeared 
that the site for the schools lay between the vicarage gar- 
dens and the vicarage meadows, and premises of a Mr. Cook. 

The plaintiffs were informed that the plans would have 
to be approved by the Education Committee of Privy 
Council, in order to, obtain a grant in aid of the building. 



SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH- 



615 



On the 25th May^ 1860, the committee resolved to erect 
a wall to separate the vicarage gardens from the school 
site, and also from the premises of Mr. Cook. 

On the 2nd June, 1860, the plaintiffs sent plans, Sec. to 
defendants, with a letter, called the particulars or report, 
stating that there were benches and desks, and warming 
and ventilating apparatus, and bath-rooms, and that the 
cost of the buildings, including the master&apos;s and mistress&apos;s 
residences, and the boundary fences, was estimated at 
1,485/., and the cost of the bath-rooms to 502. The details 

of the estimate were — 

£ 

Schools 750 

Boundary fences . . • . 250 
Residences .... 485 
Bath-rooms,&amp;c 60 

£1,545 

The plaintiffs&apos; estimate, therefore, for the whole was 
1,645/. 

On receiving the above estimate, the defendants wrote 
to the plaintiffs to inquire whether it included the laying 
out of the gardens, and gravelling the play-grounds, and 
likewise asked to be informed of the latest works executed 
from the plaintiffs&apos; designs — with the amount of their esti- 
mate, and the actual cost of completing the work in each 
case. To this the plaintiff replied, that their estimate did 
include the laying out of the gardens, and the gravelling 
of the play-grounds, and he added ** There is no instance 
of any building erected under my superintendence, where 
contracts have been exceeded unless additions or altera- 
tion have been authorized by the parties themselves. This 
is the plan we invariably follow, and it is the best security 
against a building costing more than it was originally in- 
tended to do.&quot;

a meeting of the sub-committee^ when he was asked if 
the buildings could be carried out for the amount of his 
estimate* He and the members of the committee present 
did not agree as to the answer; his version of which was 
that he believed they could. He was then told of certain 
alterations required, as to the position of the industrial 
schools, and the substitution of a wall for a fence, (as 
provided in the estimate,) next to the vicarage gardens. 
The plaintiff, Innes, said these alterations could be effected 
for an additional expense of 60/. 

On the 7th June, the plaintiff Innes attended another 
meeting of the committee, at which one or two other 
alterations were suggested, and he was asked whether 
they could be carried out within the estimate. There 
was here again a contradiction in the evidence; but on 
the one hand it was sworn that the plaintiff Innes said 
that they could, and on the other hand he did not say that 
he had stated that they could not; and the effect of the 
evidence appeared to be that he said he thought they 
could or might be, and that, at all events, they were led to 
believe that such was his statement. 

The plaintiffs were told by the defendants that they 
resolved to carry out his plans, with the above alterations, 
and he was asked his charge, to which he answered that it 
was the usual rate of five per cent, commission. 

The minute made by the committee was (a), Mr. Innes 
was in attendance to receive the suggestions of the com- 
mittee. Several important modifications were proposed by 
the committee, and adopted by Mr. Innes. It appeared 
that the whole cost of executing the plans, excluding 
architect&apos;s charges, would be about 1,545/. 



(a) Blackburn, J., bad made 
an order in the present action, that 
the plaintiffs should be allowed to 
inspect and take copies of the 
minutes of the meetings of the 



committee, of which the defendants 
are members, and the entries in 
the minute-book, so far as they re- 
late to the plaintiffs and the matters 
in difference in this action.

As the committee could not yet count on more than 
l|350/.y a question arose whether they should adopt the 
course of omitting for the present the teachers&apos; residences. 
It was resolved to accept Mr. Innes&apos;s plans, with certain 
modifications, and to proceed at once to [make the neces- 
sary inquiries, ad to practicability and desirableness] of 
carrying them into execution. (It was suggested for the 
plaintiff, that for the words in brackets, should be read 
&quot; to obtain tenders from builders, for the purpose of 
carrying them into execution,^&apos; the words being written on 
an erasure.) 

Mr. Innes again met the committee, when the chair- 
man informed bfm of the adoption of his plans, and 
requested him to make copies, and prepare the detailed 
specifications. 

On the 26th June, the plaintiff Innes took out the 
quantities. 

On the 27th June he prepared an advertisement for 
tenders, stating that the plans and quantities could be 
seen at the plaintiffs&apos; offices. 

On the 11th July the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs, 
informing them that the lowest tender was 2,056/. 

On the 12th July, the defendants informed the plaintiff 
Innes that they had determined not to accept any of the 
tenders, and not to carry out his plans. The plaintiff 
Innes said that the estimates could be reduced, but this 
was refused. 

There were eleven tenders, of which the average was 
2,321/., and the committee resolved, that the lowest 
builder&apos;s estimate was so greatly in excess of that of 
Mr. Innes, that they entirely abandoned his plans. Of this 
the plaintiffs were informed. 

On the 23rd July the plaintiffs wrote to the committee 
in these terms : —

tliink that several reductions may be made, and we suggest

In December, 1860, this action was brought.

On the part of the plaintiffs, evidence was given to show 
that these additions would have cost 250/. 

On the part of the defendants, evidence was given to 
show that the cost of alterations was counterbalanced by 
some savings.

the expenses, and that he said they would not,

it is evidence

whether he

Bavill, Luih^ and Oarth, for the plaintiff. 

Hawkins, Couch, and Holl, for the defendants. 

On the 23rd April, 1860, Mr. Pym, the deceased, was a 
passenger by the railway ; and,&apos;when^the train was passing 
through the Hatfield station, through a siding on the 
down side, the train went off the line at a spot where a 
rail was under repair, on account of some defect in it; 
and from that cause the injuries ensued, of which he had 
died. 

The rail was seen to break as the engine went over it, 
and the carriages then went off the line in different di- 
rections, and it appeared that the deceased had been 
thrown violently out of the one in which he was. 

The negligence relied on by the plaintiff was, that the 
rail was in such a damaged state, through wear and 
tear, that it was dangerous to allow it to remain on the 
line. 

And, in support of this case, scientific witnesses were 
called, who said that, when a rail was in such a state, the 
permanent way could not be considered as in good and 
proper working order, nor safe for the high speed at which 
the train in question was going. 

In addition to this, the rail had been &apos;&apos; turned&quot; two or 
three months before ; and the evidence showed that it was 
damaged even then. And it was proved that there was a 
criick in it at that time, notwithstanding which, it was left 
to a mere foreman of plate layers to decide that it should 
be turned, as it accordingly was, without any report or in- 
spection by a superior officer. 

The engineer of the Company could not explain why 
the rail broke ; but thought it was on account of the flaw 
or crack, which appeared in the rail. His opinion was, 
that the fractured rail was safe but fur the flaw, and that 
the flaw had taken place since the turning. 



SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



621 



Mr. Bidder, the eminent engineer, however, gave strong 
evidence on behalf of the Company to negative the alleged 
negligence, and to the effect that the rail was fit to be 
turned, and that the fracture had occurred since. 

The main question, however, was as to damage. 

The deceased was possessed of an estate in fee to the 
value of about 4,000/. a year. He was forty-one years of 
age. There was a jointure of 1,000/. a year settled on his 
wife, and the whole 4,000/. a year went to his eldest son, 
who was ten years of age. There was a sum of 20,000/. 
settled on the younger children, giving them 100/. a year 
each. The ages of the children varied from ten years to 
two months. There was, besides, personalty to the amount 
of 3,000/. 

It was objected, on the part of the defendants, that 
there was no evidence of legal damage under the statute. 

That point, as a question of law, was reserved. 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury). — Railway Companies 
are not insurers of their passengers&apos; lives. They are only 
bound to use the care and caution which may be reason- 
ably expected by reasonable men. 

If you should be of opinion that the accident was owing 
to the fracture of the rail, and that the use of the rail was 
negligence on the part of the Company, the plaintiff is en« 
titled to your verdict, provided it is established that the 
plaintiff and her children, or any of them, have sustained 
pecuniary loss by the death of the deceased. No loss not 
pecuniary &apos;can be considered, in such a case. 

The loss of a father&apos;s care and advice cannot be re- 
placed ; but you cannot give compensation in respect of it, 
nor to the widow, for the loss of her husband&apos;s society and 
affection for the rest of her life. The eldest son is out of 
the question ; for, so far as pecuniary considerations are 
concerned, he is a gainer by the death of his father. As 
regards the others, the widow having 1,000/. a year and 
the children their shares in the interest of 20,000/. (at the

rate of four per cent.), that gives 1,800/. a year; deducting 
which from 3,870/. (the exact amount of the father&apos;s in- 
come), it leaves 2,070/. a year, which primA facie is the 
pecuniary loss the family have sustained ; because, instead 
of the sum of 3,870/. being divided among the family or 
expended for their benefit, the whole goes to the eldest 
son, and accumulates for him. 

But, of course, it cannot be taken that the 2,070/. a year 
is all a dead loss to the widow and her children, because 
the deceased would, doubtless, have expended a portion of 
it on himself. 

On the other hand, it is fair to consider that he would 
not have expended the whole difference upon himself, but 
would have taken care that his children should have 
the benefit of a first-rate education, and some proper 
provision. 

You will say, therefore, whether you are led to the con- 
clusion that a certain portion of his income, beyond the 
1,800/. a year (which the widow and children would have 
after his death) would be laid aside for the benefit of his 
family, or applied for their benefit and advancement in 
life. And if you think the CSompany liable in this action, 
and that the family have sustained pecuniary damage in 
that respect, you will estimate the amount. 

You will bear in mind, as to the personalty, to the 
amount of 3,000/., the widow will get her third, and all the 
children their shares of the residue. It is fair to suppose 
that, if the father had lived, he would have made pro- 
vision for his younger children out of this fund. 

The real question for you is, whether you think that 
when the father of a family, having an ample estate, is cut 
off in the prime of life, that his widow and children — in 
this case, especially the children — have not sustained a 
substantial pecuniary loss by the cessation of the income 
which they would otherwise have enjoyed ? 

It is not a mere question of what he would have given 



SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH.

them ; but whether he would not have eospended upon them 
in their education and advancement in life considerable 
sums of money out of his income, and which they will now 
lose? If so, that would, I think, be a pecuniary loss 
within the statute.

Chief Justice reporting that the ver- 
dict was satisfactory. The Court, 
however, granted a rule on the 
point reserved, as to whether there 
was pecuniary damage within the 
statute. 

The case is reported, although 
thus pending on that question, partly 
because of the opinion of the Court 



as to the evidence of negligence, 
partly because it appeared to be ad- 
mitted that the ruling of the Lord 
Chief Justice was correct, as to the 
question of fact to be left to the 
jury as to damage, (assuming that 
there could be legal damage in 
such a case ;) and partly that the- 
profession may have early and cor- 
rect information as to the facts on 
which the important question of 
law has arisen.

ZimA and Mathews for the defeodaDt. * 1861. 

The plaintiff was secretary of the Royal Benevolent 
Society for the Protection of Women and Childrepi and 
the Sleaford Hospital, for the reception and reformation of 
unfortunate women. 

The defendant was lady superintendent of the Christian 
Young Women&apos;s Society, and a subscriber to the hospital, 
and had also promoted subscriptions to its funds. 

In August, I860, Mrs. B , the mother of Ada 

B , mentioned in the libels, was residing with the 

defendant, at the house of the last-named Society, and 
was recommended by her to the plaintiff as matron of the 
Sleaford Hospital, in which capacity she was forthwith 
engaged. 

At that time there was residing at the young women&apos;s 

home the Mrs. J , mentioned in the libels, who was 

also a daughter of Mrs. B • 

In June, 1861, the plaintiff made complaints of the 
accounts of Mrs. B , as matron. 

In August, 1861, Ada B , the other daughter of 

Mrs. B , was at the hospital, and the plaintiff got her 

a situation at the Crystal Palace. 

In September, 1861, Ada B had left the situation, 

and was again with her sister Mrs. J , at Sleaford. 

On the 20th September the plaintiff heard that Mrs. 

J.-..^ had accused him of improper conduct to Ada B , 

and he went to the defendant and denied it. 

On the 27th September the plaintiff made formal com- 
plaint to the committee of the accounts of Mrs. B , 

the matron. At this time the defendant wrote the letter 
to the committee which formed the first libel. 

On the 30th September the charges against her were 
gone into before the committee. 

The result was her dismissal. 

At the same meeting of the committee, a sub-com* 
mittee (comprising the Dr. Wright mentioned in the de* 




626 CASES AT THE 

1861. claration) was appointed to consider the defendant&apos;s letter 
to the committee. 

The &apos;^ admissions/&apos; alluded to by the defendant in the 
libels, were in the conversation which she had with the 
plaintiff on the subject of the charges. 

The sub-committee wrote to the defendant desiring to 
see her on the subject, and, in answer, she wrote the letter 
which formed the libel in the second count. 

An interview then took place between the sab-com- 
mittee and the defendant, at which the slanders alleged in 
the other counts were uttered, in answer to inquiries or 
observations made by various members, and in the course 
of the discussion and investigation which ensued. 

On this occasion the defendant said, that Mrs. J 
had made certain statements to her. 

The plaintiff, being called and cross-examined as to the 
charges, was asked, in re-examination, whether there was 
any truth in any of the charges, which he denied. 

Lush proposed to put in the minutes of the meeting 
of the committee ; but 

Btlbs, J., held them inadmissible. 

Dr. Wright, the person to whom the second libel was ad- 
dressed, was called for the plaintiff, and proved what took 
place before the sub-committee. It appeared that the de- 
fendant had taken her statement from Mrs. B , and that 

she believed them to be true. Before the committee she 
declared that she had &quot; every confidence&quot; in her. There 
was no evidence that the defendant had any reason to doubt 
the truth of the statements when she made them, except 
that, when asked by the committee whether she had any 
evidence of the truth of her statements she said she had 

not, further than the statements of Mrs. B , which she 

was aware had been derived from her daughter, Ada 

B , who, it appeared, was a girl of loose character. 

The defendant had likewise told the committee that she 
placed great confidence in Mrs. J . 




SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 627 

Lushy for the defendant, contended that her communi- 1861. 
cations were privileged, although founded on hearsay ; the 
conduct of the plaintiff, as an officer of these charities, 
being a matter of public interest ; or, at all events, to the 
members of the committee, to whom alone she had made 
the communications (a). 

The defendant was called, and was asked as to state- 
ments made by Ada B . 

Parry, Serjt., objected ; but, 

Btles, J., admitted the evidence. 

It appeared that the defendant had been told by Ada 
that she had been with the plaintiff, and that she had 
slept out more than once while at the Young Women&apos;s 
Home, saying she had been with friends. The defendant 
stated that she had gone to the plaintiff and expressed 
her fears about the girl, and then it was that the expressions 
which the defendant alluded to in her letters as indicating 
indifference, or implying an admission of the charges, 
were made use of. 

The defendant also swore that Mrs. J bad told 

her Ada had said that the plaintiff had led her astray, and 

that Mrs. J said also, the plaintiff had taken liberties 

with herself. 

It appeared that the plaintiff had first introduced the 
girls to the defendant. 

Mrs. J and Mrs. B were called for the de- 
fendant, and confirmed her evidence. 

Ada B was likewise called for the defendant ; but 

Parry, Serjt., declined to examine her as to the charges 
concerning her. 

Lush, in summing up, contended that the sole question 
was, whether the defendant, at the time she made the 
statements, believed them to be true. 

(a) Vide TumbuU y. Bird, anie, p. 508. 




628 CASES AT THE 

1861. Parry, Serjt., in reply contended that the defendant 
had recklessly made herself the vehicle of false and ma- 
licious charges trumped up by Mrs. B in revenge for 

her dismissal, and that the defendant ought reasonably to 
have seen that there really was no credible evidence in 
support of the charges she had chosen to make. 

Btles, J. (to the jury). — If the defendant and the com- 
mitttee had an interest in the matter, she was privileged in 
making the communications to them. The commiitee of 
course were interested, and, if she either subscribed or 
got any one to subscribe, then she was interested. If 
you think that she stepped forward herself to vindicate 

the character of Mrs. B as a servant whom she bad 

recommended, then her communication was privileged. 

The question then is, whether she reasonably (a) believed 
in the truth of her statements, and whether she made tbem 
honestly ? 

The truth of the charges is not now in issue (as there is 
no plea of justification), although as the plaintiff was cross- 
examined about them, I allowed him to deny them. 

You have not to inquire whether the charges were true ; 
but whether the defendant when she made them reasonably 
and honestly believed them to be so ? 

As regards the second letter, it was in answer to the 
committee. 

As regards the oral statements, they were in the course 
of the investigation before the committee. 

If the defendant spoke maliciously, and desiring to injure 
the plaintiff, then she would not be privileged. 

But if her motive was pure and honest, and merely to 
promote the interests of the hospital to which she sub- 
scribed, or vindicate the character of a servant whom she 
had recommended, then she was privileged.

— ^ Term, 

JJECLARATION, that the defendant was possessed of a An action 
steam traction or locomotive engine, and had long used the a person who^ 
same for the purpose of drawing trucks and carriages in Jln^i^jury****** 
and along the public streets and highways; and the said ^^&quot;&apos;^^^^^

and for the cause alleged to frighten horses, as alleged. 

3. That the defendant did not know the premises as 
alleged. 

Lush and Joseph Brown for the plaintiff. 

Piffottf Serjt., and Prentice for the defendant. 

The defendant carried on the business of a contractor, 
and was the owner of an engine called &apos;* Bray&apos;s Traction 
Engine,&quot; used for drawing heavily-laden trucks and 
carriages along the public highway. 

The phtintiff was the driver of a Highgate omnibus, the 
horses of which, while the plaintiff was driving, became 




630 CASES AT THE 

1861. frightened by the noise, smokey and appearance of the 
defendant&apos;s engine as it passed on the Hampstead Road ; 
in consequence of which the plaintifT was thrown, and 
suffered severe injury. 

The defendant was using the engine for the purpose of 
removing a large quantity of earth, in the execution of a 
contract he had entered into with the New River Company. 

The defendant relied on the 24&amp;25 Vict. c. 70,— &apos;&apos;An 
Act for regulating the use of Locomotives on Roads,&quot; and 
the tolls to be levied on such locomotives,&amp;c. ; which 
recites, &apos;&apos; That the use of locomotives is likely to become 
common on turnpike and other roads :&quot; and that the turn* 
pike and highway^acts do not contain any provision for re- 
gulating the use of locomotives on the roads to which they 
respectively apply,&amp;c., and then proceeds to provide &apos;&apos; as 
to the size and weight of locomotives.&quot; Sect. 3. &apos;* Every 
locomotive propelled by steam, or any other than animal 
power * * * drawing any waggon or carriages shall have 
the tire of the wheels thereof not less than nine inches in 
width, but no locomotive shall exceed seven feet in width 
or twelve tons in weight * * * and the owner of any loco- 
motive used contrary to the foregoing provision shall, for 
every such offence, forfeit 6/., provided that, whereas it may 
be desirable that locomotives of a greater width than seven 
feet, and of a greater weight than twelve tons, should be 
allowed to be used under certain circumstances. Any 
person desiring to use any such locomotive on any street 
or highway within the limits of the metropolis, as defined 
by 18&amp;19 Vict, (the Local Management Act), shall apply 
to the Lord Mayor ♦ ♦ * or other person having the 
charge of any such street,&amp;c., who shall have power to 
authorize such locomotive to be used.&quot; 

By sect. 5, there is a power to the Secretary of State to 
prohibit the use of locomotives destructive to highways, or 
dangerous to the public. 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 631 

By sect. 8, locomotives propelled by steam are to con- 1861. 
Bume their own smoke. 

By sect. 9, no locomotive must be used without at least 
two persons to drive and conduct it. 

By sect. 11, no locomotive is to be driven along any 
turnpike or public highway at a greater speed than ten 
miles an hour ; and any person acting contrary hereto is 
to forfeit a penalty. 

By sect 13, nothing in the act contained shall authorize 
any person to use upon a highway a locomotive engine 
which shall be so constructed or used as to cause a public 
or private nuisance ; and every person so using such engine 
shall, notwithstanding this act, be liable to an indictment, 
or action, as the case may be, for such uses where, but for 
the passing of the act, such indictment or action could be 
maintained. 

The accident occurred on the 19th June. 

The engine had been used more than a month previously ; 
and without any accident, otherwise than by frightening 
horses several times, without actual injury. 

It was going at the time at a speed of six miles an hour. 

There was evidence that the noise made by the wheels 
was likely to and had frightened horses of passing vehicles, 
but no evidence that this could be avoided. 

The plaintiff proved that his horses had been before 
frightened by the engine, though actual injury had not 
occurred. 

Parry, Seijt., submitted that there was no case, as there 
was no evidence of a scienter; and this was material, as the 
statute authorized the use of the engine. 

Eblb, C. J. — If the scienter is material, is there not 
evidence of it ? as there is evidence that the horses were 
frightened by the engine; and as the defendant&apos;s men 
must have known this, is that not evidence that he 
knew it ? 




632 CASES AT TIfE 

J^^^ Lush contended^ citing sect. 13 of the statute (vide ante), 

that as the action was grounded on a nuisance at common 
law, the scienter was not material. 

Erlb, C. J., said he should ask the jury* whether the 
defendant did not know that the use of the engine was 
dangerous on public roads. 

Parry, Serjt., then went to the jury, admitting thai 
care was necessary to prevent injury to the public; and 
he called witnesses to show that such care was taken by 
the defendant, and to show that no accident, that is, no 
actual injury, had ever been caused by the engine before. 
It was not, however, denied that it had been very nearly 
causing an accident with injury,and had actually frightened 
horses, and compelled the drivers of vehicles to get down 
and hold their horses&apos; heads. 

The defendant&apos;s evidence, however, went to show that 
this was rather the exception than the rule, and that the 
majority of horses went by unfrightened. But the de- 
fendant&apos;s witnesses admitted, on cross-examination, that 
they had seen horses shy at the engine. 

As regards the care of the engine, it was shown to be 
under the control of several competent persons acquainted 
with it, and no carelessness in its management was shown ; 
on the contrary, it appeared that the engine had been 
repeatedly driven through crowded thoroughfai-es without 
accident. 

The weight of the engine was ten tons ; and it did not 
appear that any express requisition of the statute had been 
disregarded. 

One witness for the defendant said, ** My usual practice 
is to let off the steam when I see horses timid.&quot; He added, 
however, &apos;* I have seen persons hold their horses&apos; heads, or 
turn out of the road.&quot; 

Another witness, foreman of engineers of Bray&apos;s Traction 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 633 

Engine Company, proved that the engine had been used 1861, 
three or four years. 

The defendant was called, and stated that before he 
engaged the engine he enquired if it had ever caused an 
accident, and found that it had not. And that he also 
enquired as to its safety of construction, and had no reason 
to believe it dangerous. 

This was the only evidence as to the construction of the 
engine. 

No evidence was given by the plaintiff to prove that it 
could have been constructed otherwise, so as to avoid the 
noise or other alleged causes of danger : nor that by being 
managed otherwise they could be avoided. Nor that any 
precautions which might have been taken had not been 
taken. 

On the other hand, no evidence other than above men- 
tioned, was given by the defendant to prove that precautions 
had been taken ; and the strength of his case seemed to 
be that though the engines had been used for years, no 
injury had ever been caused by it before. 

On the other hand, all his witnesses admitted that they 
had known horses to shy at it. 

The defendant, however, was not expressly proved to 
have heard or known this, otherwise than as an inference 
from the knowledge of his servants and the other wit- 
nesses. He himself was not asked the question, although 
he was asked generally whether he knew it to be dangerous, 
and denied that he did so. 

Parry, Serjt., in summing up, relied chiefly on the 
absence of any evidence of scienter, and on the long use 
of the engine without accident 

Lushfin reply, insisted that the scienter was immaterial, 
and that it was admitted that the engine wa attended with 
danger, and therefore was a nuisance on the highway. But 



634 



CASES AT THE 



1861. 




there is evidence of the defendant&apos;s knowledge of the 
danger. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — The plaintiff is entitled to 
your verdict, if the engine was calculated by its noise and 
appearance to frigliten horses, so as to make the use of the 
highway dangerous to persons riding or driving horses. 
For the defendant has clearly no right to make a profit at 
the expense of the security of the public. 

Besides this, however, which is the main question, I 
desire you to find separately (as there is an issue on the 
scienter), whether, before the accident, the defendant knew 
of the danger, supposing you find it to exist. If he knew 
it from his men, or other persons, it would be sufficient. 
So, if he knew it from the nature of the engine itself. (The 
jury found this in the affirmative.)

SITTINGS- QUEEN&apos;S BENCH, 635 

on the lOtb Aprils 1854, your Majesty&apos;s suppliant, by ig^j 
letter, addressed to the Comptroller of the Navy, tendered v^*v-^ 
to deliver,&amp;c., meadow or upland hay at the ports of ^°** 

London, Liverpool, or Dublin, in quantities not exceeding ^&quot;* Quben. 
52 tons weekly, at the price of 6/. 10^. per ton for meadow 
hay, and 7Z. lO*. per ton for upland hay, during twelve 
months from the date of the letter. 

That on the 25th April, 1854, J. W. Woodley, one of 
your Majesty&apos;s Deputy Commissary-Generals, and an 
agent duly authorized for the purpose, accepted the said 
offer of your suppliant, and thereupon a contract was 
made between the said J. W. Woodley, so authorized as 
aforesaid, and your suppliant, and that your suppliant 
should deliver to your Majesty&apos;s agent at Liverpool, ap- 
pointed for the purpose, compressed meadow hay, in 
quantities not exceeding 50 tons weekly, for and during 
the period of twelve months from the 10th April, at and 
for the price of 6/. lOs. per ton, and that the said agent 
at Liverpool should receive the hay, and pay for the 
same on delivery. And the said Woodley thereupon 
gave orders to your suppliant to commence delivering 
the hay, according to the contract, at Liverpool, to 
one F. Bevis, an agent duly authorized to receive the 
same. 

Averment, that suppliant was afterwards ready and 
willing, and offered, to deliver the hay, according to the 
contract; but that Woodley, so being such agent as afore- 
said, refused to allow the same to be received by the said 
Bevis, and required that suppliant should substitute a cer- 
tain portion of compressed upland hay, at the price of 
71. 105. per ton, in lieu of a certain similar portion of 
compressed meadow hay, so agreed upon as aforesaid; 
that suppliant did so, and that it was then agreed by and 
between him and Woodley, being such agent as aforesaid, 
that upland hay should be substituted for meadow hay, 
and that all the terms and conditions of the contract 




636 CASES AT THE 

1861. hereinbefore mentioned^ should apply to the upland hay, 
and that suppliant should deliver upland hay at Liverpool, 
in quantities not less than 62 tons weekly, at the price 
of 7L lOs. per ton, for and daring the period before agreed 
upon. 

Averment, that afterwards, in January, 1855, while 
suppliaqt was ready and willing, and had offered, to supply 
said upland hay, according to the contract, the said Bevis, 
so being such agent as aforesaid^ and duly authorized in 
that behalf, absolutely refused to receive any more hay 
from suppliant, although he had done all things neces- 
sary to entitle him,&amp;c. That one of the terms of the 
contract was, that, if necessary, to put an end to the 
contract before the end of twelve months, reasonable 
notice should be given. 

Averment, that no such notice was given. Allegations 
of damage.

not, nor is any of them, true in fact. Issue. 

Lush, Digby Seymour, and Oibbons, for the suppliant

The question was, as to whether the contract was, as 
stated in the petition, to deliver 50 tons a week for twelve 
months; or only for 150 tons, to be delivered in weekly 
quantities of 50 tons. 

The petitioner was examined at great length, in support 
of his version of the transaction. 

Woodley, being abroad, had been examined on commis- 
sion, and his evidence was read in explicit denial of the 
petitioner&apos;s statement of the contract 

The correspondence was voluminous, and the evidence 
extensive ; the trial lasting several days. 

On the lOth April, the tender was made, in terms as 
stated. 




SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 637 

On the 17th April, Mr. Julyan, the Deputy Com- 1861 
missary-General at Manchester, wrote to Scott, the sap- 
pliant, and ordered 150 tons of compressed meadow hay, 
at 6/. lOs., subject to approval by the military officers at 
Belfast. 

The Board of Officers rejected the hay as being meadow 
hay merely, and not upland hay. 

The suppliant then went to Manchester and saw Wood- 
ley, who then was Deputy Commissary-General there, (in 
place of Julyan, removed,) and showed a bale of the re- 
jected hay. The contract stated in the petition was said 
by the suppliant to have been entered into by Woodley, 
orally, on the occasion of this interview. 

The suppliant sent some more meadow hay for in- 
spection, but it was rejected as before. Woodley then 
ordered 100 tons of upland hay, at 71. 10s., which was 
what the suppliant stated as the substituted contract. 
Finally this hay was likewise rejected, and subsequently 
the suppliant had an interview with Sir Charles Trevelyan 
(then at the Treasury), who ordered 160 tons of upland 
hay, as the suppliant represented in pursuance of the 
substituted contract; but according to the case on the 
part of the Crown, simply, in pursuance of the original 
contract Shortly after this the suppliant signed some 
memorandum, which, on the part of the Crown, it was 
desired to put in, as containing a statement or settlement 
of the true contract. 

Sir W. Atherton, A.-G., cross-examining the suppli- 
ant, put into his hands a paper, and asked him if he had 
not signed such a memorandum, which the suppliant ad- 
mitted that he had, whereupon (the paper being a copy of 
the memorandum in question) Sir W. Atherton, A.-O. 
was proceeding to cross-examine the suppliant, as to the 
contents, when

&quot;7^ produced. 
The Queen. ^^^ ^&apos; ^^^^^on^ A.-G., said he was not prepared to 
produce the original, as it appeared to have been lost; 
but he apprehended that, as according to the doctrine of 
Slatterie v. Pooley (a) he might have proved an admis- 
sion by the suppliant, as to the terms of any document 
he had signed, so he might take such admission now in 
Court, from the suppliant&apos;s own mouth. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — I doubt whether that can be done 
without giving some evidence to account for the absence 
of the original, as it is a document which, from its nature, 
would be in the custody of the Crown. If it be in exist- 
ence, clearly the suppliant is entitled to see it. And, if it 
is not^ surely it should at least be in some way accounted 
for. 

Digby Seymour also relied on the fact that an order 
had been made at chambers, that a list of all documents 
to be put in by either side should be given to the other, 
and that the document in question was not in the list 
delivered on the part of the Crown ; but 

CocKBURN, C. J., thought that this, even if it were a 
ground for an attachment for disobedience of the order, 
would not preclude the Crown from putting in the docu- 
ment; and, at all events, not so if (as appeared in this case) 
the document had been discovered after the order and the 
delivery of the lists under it. But the Crown must give 
some evidence as to the original. 

Sir William Atherton, A.-G., then called Bevis, who 
stated that, to the best of his belief, the document was 
sent to the Treasury ; but that it was not in his custody, 
when, in 1858, he handed over the papers to his successor 
under the Admiralty.

Mr. Robson, solicitor to the Admiralty, and who had J^ 
the conduct of the defence, was then called, and stated 
that he found the paper now produced, (the copy), among 
the official documents delivered to him ; and he believed 
it came from the Victualling Department. He had searched 
for the original, and had not found it among the Admiralty 
papers. 

Digby Seymour contended that this search was not suffi- 
cient, not having been made at the Treasury, and 

CocKBURN, C. J., was inclined to be of that opinion, but 
intimated that he should not allow justice to be defeated, 
through mere defect of evidence, and should allow the 
case to be adjourned to enable the Crown to prove a 
proper search (a). 

Digby Seymour thereupon consulted with his client, and 
admitted the document, which was put in and read.

AlAerton, A.-G.,in stating the case for the Crown, was pro- 
ceeding to notice the evidence as to damage, when 

CocKBUBN, C. J., intimated that he might safely reserve 
his observations thereon for his summing up. 

Sir W. Atherton, A.-G., doubted whether this right 
would extend to comments on the evidence given for the 
suppliant, but 

CocKBXJRN, C. J., said it certainly would so far, as was 
necessary or convenient for the due application of his com^

driven recklessly across the road, and so ran his omnibus gbmbbal*&apos; 

up against the plaintiff&apos;s. Omnibus 

For the defendants their driver was called, and swore 
that he had driven up against the plaintiff&apos;s omnibus 
wilfully. 

Martin, B. — That is a question which ought hardly to 
have been asked, without cautioning the witness, as it 
amounts to a charge of a criminal offence. 

&apos; Hawkins. — He has been convicted summarily of reck- 
less driving. 

Seymour. — Not of wilful violence. 

The defendants put in their printed rules, issued to their 
drivers, prohibiting any such driving ; and, on the evidence, 

Hawkins contended that as the act was wilful, the Com- 
pany were not liable. 

Seymour contended that the rules were colourable ; and 
that the act was not really wilful in such a sense as to 
exonerate the defendants, though it was so far intentional 
that it was not accidental; for it was in pursuance of the 
defendants&apos; system, though no doubt rash and reckless. 

At the close of the case, 

Martin, B. (to the jury). — The question is, whether the 
act of the defendants&apos; driver was wilful and deliberate? 
If so, the defendants are not liable. But then you must 
be satisfied that it was so in such a sense, as that, if the 
plaintiff or any one else had been killed, the defendants&apos; 
driver would have been guilty of murder. 

For so he undoubtedly would have been, assuming the 
act of driving up against the other omnibus to have been 
wilful and deliberate, as it has been represented. The 
mere fact that the defendants&apos; driver was guilty of mis-

conduct, would not exonerate them ; and if the driving up 
against the plaintiff&apos;s omnibus was only done recklessly, 
they are liable. 

But if it was done designedly, and with the intention 
of striking against the omnibus and injuring it, then they 
are not liable. If the act was wilful in that sense, find for 
the defendants ; if only reckless, find for the plaintiff.

Plea : never indebted, except as to a small sum paid 
into Court, in respect of a separate bill. 

Hawkins and Karslake for the plaintiffs. 

Collier, J. J, Powell, and Charles Boyle, for the 
defendants. 

The claim in dispute was a bill of costs to the amount 
of about 70/., in respect of the defence of an action by one 
Kingston, against the defendants. In that action Kingston 
had claimed coinpensation for wages earned in, and also for 
a wrongful dismissal from, the defendants&apos; service, in the 
capacity, as he alleged, of accountant, employed at the 
rate of 2/. a week; whereas they contended that he had 
been engaged only as a clerk at 1/. a week. They had 
paid into Court the amount which would be due for wages 
at that lower rate, and denied any further liability. 

One of the now plaintiffs, Surtees, had the conduct of 
the business, and had prepared briefs for the defence, 
instructed and retained counsel in the usual way. The 
witnesses briefed for the defence were the two defendants, 
who spoke to the terms of the retainer; and two other

ployment, and the value of the services. Duwm 

The briefs, containing their proofs, however, being put &quot;* Another 

in, it appeared that one of them would have stated that he Hallbn 

and Another, 
should have given at the rate of 70/. or 80/. a year for such 

services as those which Kingston had rendered. 

On the day of trial the cause was entered on a second 
count, and low down on the list, but through other causes 
going off it was called on suddenly, and neither of the now 
plaintiffs, nor any of their clerks, were in Court. 

The defendants were walking in the outer hall, and only 
heard by accident that their cause was called on. They 
went into the Court at once, and were barely in time to 
have their evidence taken in what they termed a &apos;&apos; hurried 
way.&quot; The other two witnesses were not in Court, but it 
did not appear that they were called outside, and Mr. Serjt. 
Pigott, the defendants&apos; counsel on that occasion, was now 
called on the part of the plaintiffs, and stated that he had 
not intended to call them, and did not believe it would 
have been for the advantage of the defendants to call them. 
The jury had found a verdict in favour of Kingston for 25/. 
beyond the sum paid into Court. 

Upon this evidence, 

Bramwell, B., said, although, no doubt, it was, strictly 
speaking, the duty of the plaintiffs, the attomies, to have 
been present in Court with their witnesses, yet, under all 
the circumstances, their absence was a very excusable or 
venial default, and at any rate they would not be precluded 
from recovering, unless the jury thought their absence had 
not only caused the defendants any real damage, but had 
made the whole of their services in the defence utterly 
useless and of no value at all ; which surely could not be 
contended. 

Collier, however, went to the jury, contending that if

the plain tiiTs had been in Court with the two absent 
witnesses, the defendants might have got the verdict. 

(There had been an order to refer the bill to taxation.) 

At the close of the case, 

Bramwell, B. (to the jury). — ^The plaintiffs are entitled 
to recover unless it appears that their services were wholly 
useless and valueless. Can yoa say so, after the evidence 
of my Brother Pigott? It rather appears that the evi- 
dence of the absent witnesses would have been worse than 
useless to the defendants. 

No doubt it was the duty of the plaintiffs to have been 
present in Court, either in person or by their clerk, to 
marshal the witnesses, and answer the questions of counsel. 
But the question here is, what was the real consequence of 
their absence, and whether it made all their services value- 
less ? If not, it merely disentitled them to the costs of 
that day&apos;s attendance, to be disallowed on taxation. In 
that case find for the plaintiffs, subject of course to 
taxation.

as A 1, which had been obtained by trickery on the part of an agent of the vendor : — Held,

pay money* the amount claimed being admitted, and the only plea, fraud, drfendant was 
entitled to begin.

instalmentSi of which 150/. had been paid down, and the 
residue was to be paid by a certain day elapsed, or when 
the ship should sail, whichever should first happen. 

The particularsi however, (the ship having been repu- 
diated and resold), claimed only a balance of about 950/. 

Plea : fraud and covin. 

In the second action the declaration contained two 
counts for false representation. The first count set forth 
that the defendant Tindalli knowing that his ship was not 
in such a condition as to be entitled, according to the 
rules of Lloyd&apos;s, to be entered and classified, in order to 
deceive the plaintiff, and induce him to become the pur- 
chaser, caused it to be falsely and fraudulently represented 
to the said society^ that certain repairs required by them, 
in accordance with their rules, to be done, in order to 
entitle the ship to be registered and classified, had been 
done, and thereby falsely and fraudulently procttred the 
said society to register and classify the ship under the 
class known as the best of ships of the second description 
of the first class, and entered in the registry book as A 1 
in red, for seven years, and represented to the plaintiff that 
the ship was so registered, whereby he became the pur- 
chaser,&amp;c. 

The second count stated that the defendant, in order to 
induce the plaintiff to purchase the ship, falsely and frau- 
dulently represented to the plaintiff that the ship had 
undergone a certain amount of repairs then required by 
the society, and by their surveyor, in order to entitle the 
ship to be classed as above mentioned, and that the ship 
was then in a certain state and condition, fit to be so 
classed ; relying on which representation, the plaintiff 
purchased the ship, whereas, in truth, she was not in such 
state and condition, and had not undergone such repairs 
as the defendant well knew her. 

Third count, on a warranty, that the ship had received 
the required repairs.

Bovill suggested that, as the question in both actions 
was substantially the same, they should be tried together, 
to which 

Lush assented, and the jury were thereupon sworn in 
both actions. 

Bovill then claimed the right to begin in the first action, 
in which he was for the defendant, the only plea being 
fraud, and the burden of proof upon him. 

Lush contended that, as the action was for unliquidated 
damages, and the amount due was in dispute, he was en- 
titled to begin. 

Bovill thereupon declared that he admitted the amount 
claimed in the particulars, whereupon, 

Erlb, C. J., ruled that he should begin. 

In March, 1861, Tindall, who occasionally bought and 
sold ships in London, had the ship in question at Leith, 
and sent one Thomas, as his agent there, to superintend 
some repairs, with a view to obtaining a certificate of 
classification from Lloyd&apos;s, as A 1, of the second class. 
For that purpose it was necessary to have the ship sur- 
veyed by Lloyd&apos;s surveyor there, and she was so surveyed, 
and certain repairs directed by the surveyor, which were pro- 



SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 



647 



ceeded with. He directed that the ship should be &quot; bung*^ 
(t. e, held up, so as to show the state of her bottom); and 
re-trenailed and re-caulked. Having to leave Leith for 
a few days, while the repairs were going on, Thomas 
pressed him to sign the necessary report before he left ; 
promising that the ship should be *&apos; hung&quot; as directed, and 
the repairs duly executed. The surveyor accordingly 
signed the report, dated on the 30th March, which was 
forthwith sent to Lloyd&apos;s, where it was received on the 
2nd April. On the surveyor&apos;s return, he found the ship 
tarred inside and outside, which prevented his seeing how 
far the required repairs had been done. In point of fact 
the ship was re-trenailed from the wales to the bilge (i. e. 
to the water-line), but not from the bilge to the keel, on the 
bottom. She was also re-caulked in a manner, although, 
as it turned out, not properly and eifectually. The report 
stated that the ship was well repaired, re-trenailed and re- 
caulked from wales to keel, her timbers sound and good, 
her bolts firm, and her condition in general so good as to 
entitle her to be classed A 1, of the second class. On the 
2nd April, Lloyd&apos;s, in this report, granted a certificate of 
such a classification. On the 5th April, Thomas was in 
London, and saw Tindall, the owner, who had been ex- 
amined on interrogatories, in answer to which, being asked 
whether he had not had an interview with Thomas, and if so, 
what had passed as to the ship and the repairs, answered, 
that he had not had any such interview ; but who now ad- 
mitted, on cross-examination, that he had seen Thomas 
then on the subject, and that Thomas knew the ship 
would be sold. He avowed that he had designed to have 
the ship classed, and had first applied to Lloyd&apos;s, in London, 
to send down a surveyor for the purpose, but was told the 
local surveyor must be employed, and the letters from 
Thomas to him during the repairs, contained these pas- 
sages on the subject : —

by being careful. • • • I shall have to put some few 
planks in the wales, far class^ as I believe that will be 
all. If you class the ship, it will be all it will cost to you.&quot; 

&quot;March 2, 1861. — We had the surveyor hereto-day, and 
he has been to survey the ship. We shall have the class 
we want for her. He is quite satisfied with her and the 
work we are doing for her, and has not ordered anything to 
her more than what I told you I thought she teanted, t. e. 
the planks in the wales. ♦ * • The timber is quite sound. 
* ♦ * I had to get a few more planks for the wales.&quot; 

There was no other letter from Thomas produced in 
the period between this and the 20th April, during which 
the report of the surveyor was sent to London (on the 2nd 
April), and the certificate of classification obtained, and 
Thomas himself had been to London, and seen the plain- 
tiflf Tindall about the ship. On his return to Leith he 
wrote several times, thus : — 

&quot;20th April. — I have been busy getting the hold cleared 
up, to pay with tar before we put water in the hold. We 
are all finished now but paying her, and the caulking is all 
done.&quot; ♦ * * There were letters from the captain to the 
plaintiiFTindallput in, in one of which, Feb. 13, he wrote: 
&quot; The ship shows very little considering her age. ♦ ♦ * I 
think there will be no difficulty in getting her a class. 
Mr. Thomas intends trying it.&quot; On the 17th March the 
captain wrote to Tindall that he could have a ship fit for 
any trade, after the repairs. On the 19th April he wrote: 
&quot;The ship will be nearly finished to-morrow. * ♦ ♦ Mr. 
Thomas says she is sure to be sold on her arrival in 
London.&quot; 

Tindall was not himself at Leith. 

The surveyor at Leith stated that Thomas had applied 
to him for his report (on which the certificate was given), 
and that he had no communication with Tindall. The 
rules of Lloyd&apos;s did not require that a ship should be 



SITTINGS-COMMON PLEaS. 



649 



&apos;&lt;hung/&apos; but the surveyor had directed it to be done^ the 
better to get at the keel and do the caulking, and he said 
it might be done sufficiently for the purposes, without its 
being completely done. It appeared from the evidence of 
Innes, the shipwright employed, that the ship was to 
some extent hoisted up but not completely &apos;^ hung,&apos;&apos; so as 
to have every part of her bottom raised up and exposed. 
The surveyor did not know the ship had not been hung 
when he gave his report He declared, however, that he 
had the ship ripped open according to the rules, and that 
Lloyd&apos;s surveyor in London ripped her np more than the 
rules required. He admitted, that had he known what he 
knew now, he would not have sent such a report as he 
had done. 

He had directed what he deemed necessary to be done, 
and thought it had been done, from what Thomas told 
him. When he signed the report (dated 30th March, and 
sent next day) he had only been over the ship once, and 
the repairs, it will be seen from the letters, lasted until the 
end of April. He had been over the ship altogether above 
twenty times and had not found any reason to retract his 
report. He said that he .relied on Thomas (whom he re- 
garded as the accredited agentof Tindall), and that Thomas 
had &apos;&apos;broken faith with him&quot; and deceived him in the 
matter. (The report stated that the ship had been *&apos; Aung,*&apos; 
and re-trenailed, and re-caulked throughout, and that all 
the timbers were sound,&amp;c.) He did not think the tarring 
was unusual. 

The repairs were finished about the end of April or 
beginning of May, and then went out of dry dock to re- 
ceive a cargo. 

In June the ship came from Leith to London laden 
with coals, and Tindall advertised her for sale, and got one 
Forester to look out for a purchaser. Through him 
Baskett was introduced, and he, having looked at the 
ship while lying loaded in dock, but not having gone over

her or examined her on the 18th June, entered into a con- 
tract to buy her for 2^470/. *&apos; with all her faults, and in her 
then state and condition,&quot; the vendor to metal and re- 
caulk her at his expense. At this time an inventory was 
handed to the vendee, in which the ship was described as 
classed as A 1, red (second class), and lately repaired and 
re-trenailed ; and he was told by Tindall that she had been 
repaired at the cost of 800/., and that the ship was classed 
as above mentioned. As to the expense of the repairs, the 
shipwright&apos;s bill only came to 600/1, but according to the 
evidence of the vendor, Tindall, they came to 800/. On 
the 20th June the bill of sale was executed, and a re- 
assignment by way of mortgage to secure the purchase- 
money. The vendee swore he had not gone over the ship 
before the purchase, and bought her on the faith of the 
classiBcation. He stated that he had bought the ship, as 
the vendor was aware, for the conveyance of emigrants to 
Port Natal, and for that purpose it was necessary to have 
the certificate of the Emigration Commissioners, who re- 
quired a report from Lloyd&apos;s surveyor that the ship was 
sound and seaworthy. There was evidence that Tindall 
and Thomas were together at this time, looking ader the 
ship, and that the latter directed it to be felted, with a 
view to her being metalled, before her bottom was &apos;* scraped*&apos; 
in the usual course, and it was suggested that this was 
with the view of concealing the defects in the caulking and 
the unsoundness of the trenails and timbers before the 
surveyor came. Through some accident, however, this was 
not done, but on the 26th June, Lloyd&apos;s surveyor began to 
examine the ship, and found her so unsound that they not 
only declared her disentitled to her class, but doubted 
whether she could be made so, and estimated the repairs 
required for that purpose at from 1,600/. to 1,800/. Lloyd&apos;s 
thereupon gave notice to withdraw the certificate of classi- 
fication, but consented to suspend it on Tindall&apos;s pledging 
himself to have the required repairs executed. He had

since resold her as he said for 1,500/. to a person who 
had advanced him 1,200/. just before he bought her, and 
who was to have shared the profit of aay resale. 

Tindall had been examined upon interrogatories under 
an order of Willes, J., and in his answers denied- that he 
was informed of the repairs required to entitle the ship to 
receive the class she had acquired. 

Q. Did you entrust Thomas with the carrying out of 
the repairs, and give him directions and instructions re« 
specting the same ? 

A* I did not entrust him with the carrying out of the 
repairs. I may have given him some directions or instruc- 
tions respecting the same, but I do not remember. The 
shipwrights and Lloyd&apos;s surveyor at Leith carried out the 
repairs. 

Q. Had you any personal interview with Thomas upon 
the subject of the said repairs or classification ; if yes,

informed that Lloyd&apos;s surveyor required that the ship should

A. I had no such interview. 

Innes, the shipwright at Leith, was called for Baskett, 
and stated that he did such repairs as Thomas ordered, 
and he ordered none which the surveyor had not directed. 
It appeared that Innes acted on Thomas&apos;s orders. There 
were no letters from Innes to Tindall, nor from Tindall to 
him before the work was done, put in, but only after it. 

Tiudall was now called, and stated that he had bought 
the ship in March, 1860, and had altogether, including re- 
pairs, expended nearly 1,400/. upon her. In January, 1861, 
he heard that she had received damage and had put into 
Leith, and he sent down Thomas to superintend the repairs 
and see what was necessary, Thomas, he said, was a 
practical shipwright and quite competent He denied 
speaking to Thomas about the classing of the ship before

he went down, but be admitted tbat early in April, Tlioixias 
knew it was to be sold, and, as already mentioned, be 
admitted that about the 6th April, the surveyor&apos;s report 
having been received at Lloyd&apos;s, and the certificate of 
classification issued, Thomas was in London and saw him, 
and spoke to him about the ship and the repairs. 

He had not been himself at Leith. (He was not asked 
whether he had never spoken to Thomas about the classi- 
fication at that time.) He produced and put in the letters 
from Thomas and the captain to him about the repairs, 
and also some between him and Innes, the shipwright at 
Leith, after the repairs. But he denied having kept copies 
of his letters to Thomas. 

Thomas was proved to have been lately in communica- 
tion with Tindall, and to have been in Court during the 
trial, but he was not called on his behalf (a). 

In the course of the case for Baskett, a witness was 
called, who, on cross-examination, staled that Baskett bad 
been to look at the ship before the 20th June, the date of 
the bill of sale, whereupon 

Bovilly in re-examining, proposed to ask the witness, 
with a view to contradict him, by one Ives, whether he 
had not said to Ives, that Baskett had not been to see the 
ship before the 20th June. 

Lush objected, as the witness was not adverse, but 

Erle, C. J., thought that he was(&amp;), and allowed the 
question. 

The surveyor at Leith being examined as to the means 
by which Thomas had obtained his report. 

Lush objected that Tindall, the principal, could not be 
affected by the fraud of Thomas, his agent, unless shown 
to have authorized or approved of it (c).

Bwill urged that the principal, Tindall, was, in his 
action, now seeking to enforce the contract obtained by 
the means of Thomas&apos;s agency. 

Erlb, C. J., admitted the examination, but said TindalKs 
complicity must be shown. 

Bavill also put in letters from Tindall to Innes, the 
shipwright, as to the amount of repairs. 

Lush, in proving his case, claimed to put in letters from 
Thomas to Tindall, to show that Tindall had given direc- 
tions for due repairs, and supposed that his directions were 
being followed out. 

Erlb, C. J., ruled that, as the question would be as to 
Tindall&apos;s complicity with Thomas, what was conveyed to 
the mind of Tindall would be material ; and therefore 
admitted the evidence. 

Bovill, in cross-examining Tindall, proposed to read a 
paragraph in an affidavit of his in answer to interrogatories, 
with a view to contradict a statement he bad now made on 
oath. 

Lush claimed that the whole affidavit should be read. 

Bavill insisted that this was not so when he merely pro- 
posed to contradict 

Erle, C. J. — The principle is, that so much shall be 
read as may be necessary to make the question and answer 
fairly intelligible. 

Bovill then read one of the interrogatories and the 
answer (already alluded to), and cross-examined upon it 
to contradict the witness. And so of another interrogatory. 

At the close of the case, 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — The question in both 
actions is substantially the same, viz., whether Tindall, 
the principal, was guilty of, or party to, any fraud, or 
fraudulent representation? The only representations

brought home to him appear to be as to the repairs, 
and as to the classification of the ship. As to the 
former, repairs to the amount stated were executed ; and 
the ship was to a great extent re-trenailed and re-caulked. 
As to the classificaticiiy in point of fact it had been ob- 
tained : and the question, therefore, appears to come to 
this, — whether Tindall, the principal, was privy to the 
means by which Thomas obtained it ? 

At the time the report was given, on the faith of which 
the certificate was obtained, no fraud had actually been 
committed, however it may have been contrived by Thomas. 
For the surveyor knew that the repairs had not then been 
done, nor the ship hung, and he relied on the promise of 
Thomas that these things sliould be done. If Tindall was 
an accomplice in a contrivance by Thomas fraudulently to 
get the report, in order to get the certificate, find for 
Baskett ; if not, and if Tindall was not a party to any 
fraudulent representation, then find for him.

September, 1858. 

[The cause had been tried before Erle, C. J., without 
the comnxon count, when of course the defendant had 
begun.] 

Hawkins, for the defendant, claimed the right to begin, 
as the action was substantially on the bill ; and the second 
count was merely added for the purpose of gaining the 
right to commence by means of a colourable claim. 

Btles, J. — Does the plaintiff intend to give evidence on 
the second count, independent of the bill? 

M. Chambers. — Yes. A substantially different case. 
[But he did not deny that it was all one transaction.&apos;] 

Hawkins referred to the claim in the declaration to show 
that the claim was only for the amount of the bill and 
interest. 

M. Chambers. — The plaintiff claims 5,000/. as money 
lent, apart from the bill, as shown by the particulars of 
demand. 

Bylbs, J. — Then in that case your claim would have 
been 11,600/. 

M. Chambers. — The claim is merely formal. 

Bylbs, J. — I cannot allow the addition of the indebita- 
tus count to alter the right to begin, and the onus of 
proof. The defendant must begin (a). 

A loan of 5,000/. with a premium of 1,000/., and interest 
at 10 per cent, had been negotiated by Chard, the drawer, 
agent, as was alleged, for the defendant, with one Roy, as 
attorney and agent of the plaintiff; and the bill given for 
the amount as part of the same transaction. 

It was admitted that 5,000/. had been advanced by the 
plaintiff to Chard ; and that, as regarded the plaintiff him-

The case for the defendant was, that Roy was privy to 
the alleged fraud. 

The defendant&apos;s case being closed, Roy was called for 
the plaintiff. 

Hawkins replied on the whole case (a). 

Byles, J. (to the jury). — If Chard was the defendant&apos;s 
agent to receive the money advanced upon the occasion in 
question, there is the sanae issue in fact on the count for 
money lent, as upon the bill itself. 

No doubt 5,000/. was handed to Chard ; and if he teas 
defendant&apos;s agent in the transaction^ then defendant is liable 
on the bill. 

Therefore I suspect that the second count on the money 
lent, was added merely to get the right to begin. 

No doubt it is a most important point in a case of this 
kind ; for it is a great disadvantage to a plaintiff to have 
to put his case before a jury already prejudiced perhaps by 
the case for the defendant. And the defendant has had a 
very great advantage in beginning. 

Defendant must satisfy you that there was fraud, and 
that his attorney, Roy, (as it is admitted that personally 
the plaintiff was not privy to the fraud,) had notice of it. 

The main questions for you to consider are : — Was the 
bill originally affected with fraud, and never authorized or 
ratified by the defendant ? 

Did the plaintiff advance valuable consideration ? and 
was 5,000/. lent to the defendant? 

Had Roy notice of the fraud ?

On the 1 6th July this action was brought.

the deponent stated that he had on a certain day duly

Keane then contended that his proof had gone far 

enough, that the order was primA facie sufficient, and that 

in the proceedings there was some evidence of notice, 

which it was for the plaintiff to get rid of. 

Honyman contended that there was no proof of notice. 

Keating, J. — If it is necessary for the defendant to 
prove notice, I do not think it is proved. If it is necessary 
for the plaintiff to disprove it, I don&apos;t think it is dis- 
proved. But if it is to be pressed, it is a question oF fact 
for the jury. 

Honyman contended that, as the plea did not state that 
the discharge was after action, it must be taken on the 
record to have been before: Common Law Procedure 
Act, 1852, s. 68 : and therefore the plea was disproved. 

Keane applied to amend, as it was a mere pleader&apos;s 
blander. 

Honyman objected, that there ought to be no amend- 
ment, because, by Pleading Rule 22, H. T. 1853, if the 
discharge had been truly stated, the plaintiff might have 
discontinued without costs (a).

tember, 1869 {a), by one Aikman, of the 6rin of Foley and 
Aikman (the plaintiffs), brokers, on behalf of the owner, 
one Law. Previously to the policy, Foley had chartered 
the ship for &apos;^ lawful merchandize &apos;&apos; to one Gull, to the 
Cape and Kurrachee, the charter containing a clause that 
she should not carry beyond her registered tonnage, of iron. 
The registered tonnage was 1,022 tons. The ship was 
strongly built, only two years old, A 1 class, and admitted 
to have been sound and seaworthy at the time of the 
charter and of the original insurance. 

On the 24th September, 1869, the policy was originally 
underwritten by one Hislop and several others, including 
one Hooper, on behalf of and for the defendant, who sub- 
sequently subscribed again ; and also io October, sub- 
scribed another policy for l,500Z.(a). The co-plaintiff, 
Aikman, swore that when he effected the policy he did not 
know of the clause in the charter as to a cargo of iron. 
He knew the ship was to carry iron, but he did not know 
the weight or quantity : and his partner, the co-plaintiff, 
Foley, who had to do with the charter, had nothing to do 
with the policy. It was generally known at that time 
among underwriters, that as railways were being made in 
India, ships to Kurrachee usually carried out iron. Nor 
was there any objection to iron properly stowed, i. e., so 
loosely, and with such a proportion of lighter goods occu- 
pying larger space, as that the average should approach 
the standard of good stowage, forty cubic feet of measure- 
ment to every ton of weight. Although there were 1,107 
tons of iron, only 800 tons were strictly speaking dead 
weight, t. e., iron in bars, the rest being railway plant

Tabor. Aikman, the co-pIaintifT, said he had told the underwriters 

that the ship would take a &apos;^ general&apos;* cargo. He admitted 

that he had not mentioned the iron, and he was not asked 

about it. 

The ordinary rate of premiums for Kurrachee was 40s. 
per cent. ; and cargoes even of iron had been insured at 
even lower rates, direct to Kurrachee. 

But Aikman admitted that had it been known that the 
ship was to carry as much as 1,000 tons of iron, he should 
have found a difficulty in effecting an insurance on the 
ship at less than 80^. per cent. He stated, however, that 
he conceived the rate at which the policy was effected, viz., 
50s. per cent., was estimated with reference to some in- 
crease of risk, as the ordinary rate was 40s.; the rates 
even for iron varying from 40*. to 80s. The policy was 
expressed to be upon any kind of goods, and on the ship. 

The policy having been effected, the ship proceeded to 
load, and on the 19th October another policy for 1,500/. 
was underwritten by other underwriters, not including the 
defendant. [It had been ordered by consent that all 
actions on this and the other policy should abide the 
event of this action : vide ante, p. 655, n. (a).] 

On the 13th November the ship sailed, and on the 15th 
November the first return of the nature of her cargo was 
made to Lloyd&apos;s. Next day, on the 16th November, 
several of the first underwriters, not including the de- 
fendant, nor Hislop, whose name was at the head, 
declared off and returned their premiums (a).

On the 14th November, the defendant underwrote the 
first policy. There was evidence that when the ship was 
laden, and before she set sail, she was too deep in the 
water ; and there was a contest of evidence as to whether 
her free-board, i. e., her depth above water, was, as it ought 
to have been, 5 ft. 6 in., or, as on the part of defendant it 
was sworn to have been, 3 ft. 6 in. There was evidence 
that ships of her class took 50 per cent, more dead weight 
than the registered tonnage; and she loaded 1,100 tons of 
iron (of which at least 800 or 900 tons were dead weight), 
and above 800 tons of general measurement cargo, packed 
above the iron, and to be discharged at the Cape. With 
respect to the stowage of the iron, the two stevedores who 
stowed it were called, one for the plaintiffs, the other for 
the defendant, and both stated that it had been well-stowed. 
Nor was any person skilled in stowage called on the part 
of the defendant to prove that it was t7/-stowed. 

There was a great contest of evidence of surveyors, both 
as to whether the ship was overloaded and ill-stowed. 
But no complaint had been made to the brokers or owners 
before she sailed, that she was*] either overloaded or ill- 
stowed, though there was evidence that it was usual to 
make such complaint if any ground for it was observed. 

It was proved, however, that it was very material, with 
regard to the navigation of the vessel, in what manner 
iron or other heavy weight was stowed, and that bad 
stowage of it would tend to make the vessel pitch, roll, 
and strain. The log was produced to prove that during 
the voyage to the Cape, even while the weather was not 
foul, the ship did pitch, roll, and sail heavily. On reach- 
ing the Cape in February, some rough weather ensued,* 
and the ship struck upon a rock before she got safely in^o 
port When there, the 800 tons of general cargo being 
discharged, there was a claim by the owners of the general 
cargo against the owners of the ship for damage, and the 
ship was surveyed several times by surveyors of the under-

writers^ and their reports were put in. It did not appear 
that any part of the iipn had &apos;* started &quot; or ** shifted^&quot; save 
about 50 tons ; and it did not appear that this had any- 
thing to do with the loss of the ship. 

The first report of the surveyors stated that though the 
water had come in through thehatchway,and the car^o had 
been damaged, they were unable to discover any serious 
injury to the ship, and that there had been no straining of 
the bully but only at the masts, which, it was suggested, 
was caused by the rolling of the vessel ; though on the 
part of the defendant it was urged that the rolling was the 
result of bad stowage or overloading. 

The surveyors, however, proceeded to say that having 
considered &apos;&apos;the dangerous way in which the ship was 
loaded,&quot; some hundred tons of the iron should be taken 
out and re-stowed, which was done. 

A second report stated that though some sheets of 
copper required repair, there were no symptoms of strain 
on the hull, and that the seams were all close and firm ; 
that there was only some strain about the hatchway ; and 
a diver declared that the bottom was not strained. 

On the 1st May, the void created by the discharge of 
the 800 tons having been filled by 200 tons of deal, and the 
re-stowing of some hundreds of tons of iron in a looser 
manner, the surveyors reported that the ship was &quot;in Bfit 
state to prosecute her voyage.&quot; She accordingly sailed ; 
but in a fewjdays, the weather not being rough, began to 
leak, the water rose rapidly, the crew had to leave her, and 
she soon after sank. The surveyors being now examined, 
stated that when the vessel sailed there had been, by 
&apos;reason of overloading, a &apos;&apos;severe straining of the entire 
fabric of the ship,&quot; and that she was not in a fit state to 
sail on her voyage. [To account for the variance between 
this evidence and their reports, it was suggested that the 
reports had mainly reference, not to the ship, but to the 
cargo.&apos;]

claimed either of them. 

Hooper, who had subscribed on behalf of Tabor, was 
prevented by illness from being called ; but neither he 
nor Tabor, the defendant, had disclaimed, nor ever, till 
now, set up that they had been deceived. 

In the course of the case for the plaintiffs, a yvitness 
being asked whether other ships, about the same period, 
were taking iron, 

JBavill objected, that what other ships were taking was 
irrelevant; but 

Eblb, C. J.— It may be material, as showing what was

Erlb, C. J., held it relevant to the issue upon the plea 

of concealment.

who had underwritten the second policy in October, was 

called, and asked whether the rate of premiufh for iron 

was then greater than for general cargo ? 

Lush objected ; but 

Erlb, C. J., admitted the question, the co-plaintiff, 
Aikman, having been examined on the subject. 

The witness was then asked, whether there would be a 
difficulty in insuring the ship with liberty to carry iron for 
less than 80s. per cent. ?

The witness was asked, whether 60s. was the current

answered it in the negative. 

The witness having stated that he thought the co- 
plaintiff, Aikman, had offered him this risk, — it was 
asked, did you know whether the ship was going to 
Kurrachee ? 

Lush objected, that as the question related to a different 
and subsequent policy, it could not be asked, as it must be 
irrelevant. 

Bovill contended that as the actions in both policies 
were consolidated, the question was admissible ; but 

Erlb, C. J. — The actions are consolidated thus : that 
the others are to abide the event of this action (a), i. e. an 
action on ihe former policy. The question is inadmissible.

evidence that the first underwriters, in particular the 1861. 
defendant, did not know that the ship was taking iron ; ^^ 
while, on the other hand, the plaintiff, who effected the and Another 
policy, while he could not say that he told them so, swore Tabor. 
that he did not at the time he did it know of the terms of 
the charter, or the weight of iron to be carried. Nor was 
there any evidence that he knew of the quantity or weight 
of iron which was to be carried ; but he was told it was to 
be a general cargo.] 

He was then asked (having stated that he knew of a 
charter, but had not asked its terms), whether he was told 
that the ship was to be at liberty to carry iron to the 
amount of its registered tonnage. 

Lush objected ; and the question was withdrawn. 
At the close of the evidence, 

Honyman, in summing up for the defendants, relied on 
both the grounds of defence — unseaworthiness and con- 
cealment. 

Lush, in reply, contended, as to the first, that the sole 
question was, whether the ship was seaworthy with refer- 
ence to her own safety, not as to the safety of the cargo. 
And as to the second ground of defence, concealment, he 
contended that the insured was not bound to communicate 
to the underwriter, unasked, any fact, touching either ship 
or cargo, occurring before the risk commenced, even 
although it affected seaworthiness or rate of premium ; 
for as to seaworthiness, there was an implied warranty 
without inquiry, from the opening of the risk ; and as to 
other matters, it was for the underwriter to inquire. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — There are two defences 
relied on— unseaworthiness and concealment. 

As to the first, the assured warrants that the ship is sea- 
worthy ; and seaworthiness is a word of which the import 
varies with the place, the voyage, the class of ship, or even 
the nature of the cargo. In this case, the unseaworthiness 

Y T 2 



672 CASES AT THE 

1861. relied on bad reference to the cargo^ and is rested on 

&quot;^^^^ two grounds. — that the ship was overloaded, and that the 
Foley » 

and Another cargo was badly stowed* And you are to take this as the 

Tabor. &apos;^^ ^^ ^^^ subject, — that a ship will be unseaworthy if 

the risk is materially increased by reason of difficulty in 

navigating the ship, caused either by overloading or by 

bad stowage of the cargo. There is a conflict of evidence 

on both points, which it is for you to consider. 

It is not necessary for the insurer to make out that the 
loss was caused by the unseaworthiness relied upon. The 
question depends upon the state of the ship at the time 
when she sailed upon her voyage. All that happened after- 
wards is important only with regard to the retrospective 
light it may throw on the state of the vessel at that time. 
Was she unseaworthy by reason of her being either over- 
loaded or badly stowed ? If so, find for the defendant. 

Secondly, as lo concealment. This ground of defence is, 
that a material fact known to the assured was concealed 
from the underwriter. The contract of insurance is one 
which requires the most perfect good faith on the part of 
the assured. And the general rule of law, as applied 
to this case is, did the assured neglect to communicate to 
the assurer any fact known to the assured, and not known 
to the insurer, material for his guidance, in respect of the 
premium to be demanded ? Both parts of the question 
must be answered. The material fact must have been 
known to the assured, and unknown to the insurer. As to 
the latter point, actual knowledge is not essential if the 
insurer knew he had the means of knowing the feet, and 
it was within his knowledge. If, for example, he knew 
that he could learn the exact cargo at Lloyd&apos;s, and 
chose not to ascertain it, knowing or believing it would 
include iron, it was within his knowledge (a). The

First, was it material ? As it is admitted that the premium 

would have been 80s. instead of 60^., if that fact had been 

known, it must have been material, within the rule of law 

I have laid down. Next, did the assured know of it? If 

the co-plaintiff, Aikman, knew of it, they did know it. 

Then, did the defendant know of it, or might he have 

known of it if he chose (&amp;) ? It is strong for the plaintiffs 

that the defendant underwrote, not once but twice, and 

after other underwriters knew what the cargo was to be. 

All these matters are for you ; and if either there was 
unseaworthiness or concealment, find for the defendant ; 
if neither, for the plaintiffs.

does not appear to conflict with it.

White, for the defendant, put in the record of the pro-

an award of execution, to which there was no seal. 

Bovill pointed out this, but

White then called the defendant, who stated that he had 
been for years the broker, both of Melas and Co., and of 
the plaintiffs, and this was known to both firms. He had 
ro6nthly accounts with Melas and Co., settled on the 15th 
of each month, and in July he owed them a small sum 
(about 70Z.) which he paid shortly afterwards. It was 
known at Lloyd&apos;s when policies were to be paid, and that 
the day for paying was Saturday. The day for paying the 
policies in question was on Saturday, the 26th July, and 
at three o&apos;clock on that day he received the money. On 
the same day the attachment had issued, and he produced 
the notice served upon him. The balance due from him to 
plaintiffs was 753/. lis, 4d., and he swore he did not know

he had not told them. It appeared from his accounts that

at the suit of Melas, on which he had paid a large amount 
into Court. At the meeting of creditors the defendant 
found that the firm of the plaintiffs consisted of five in- 
stead of two persons (as supposed), and he had informed 
Melas and Co. of this, when the notice of attachment was 
served in the name of the two. He admitted that Melas 
had given the usual securities to restore the money, if he 
were forced to pay it over again, and had also indemnified 
him in this action. He swore that he had no interest in 
the matter (except not to have to pay it twice over), and 
that it was a matter which only concerned Melas and O). 
The judgment was on the 21st August, and there was an 
award of execution. The defendant had paid the money 
into Court on the 4th December, the plea being dated the 
3rd December. [There was no proof that execution had 
issued, save the indorsement on the record of an award of 
execution. The writ was not produced.] 

Erlb, C. J. — ^There is no proof of fraud. A preference 
of one creditor for another is no fraud, except in case of 
bankruptcy (a). And here the plaintiffs did not become 
bankrupts. 

J3oviU, — This is not a case of preference of one creditor 
for another ; because Melas and Co. were not creditors of 
the defendant to any but a small amount, paid almost im- 
mediately. It is a case of a debtor choosing to pay his 
creditor&apos;s creditor rather than his creditor, and colluding 
with the other creditor for that purpose. It is for the 
jury. 

Erle, C. J. — Assuming evidence of collusion, of course 
it is for the jury. And, if the balance of account as be- 
tween Melas and Co. and the defendant had been against 
Melas and Co., and it had appeared that the attachment 
had been a trick practised between them to pay their debt 
to the defendant, at the expense of the plaintiffs, there

would have been a case for the jury. But what evidence 
18 there of that ? The evidence is the other way, that the 
balance was in favour of Melas and Co. If I leave any 
question to the jury, it can only be whether they believe 
the defendant, and no witness being called to contradict 
him, what reason is there why they should not believe 
him? 

Bovill said he did not deny the truth of the defendant&apos;s 
evidence, but contended that it was sufficient to leave to 
the jury on the replication. 

Erle, C. J. — Taking his evidence to be true, I am of 
opinion that there is no case for the jury. 

BovilL — Still the plea is disproved. It alleges payment, 
and is dated the 3rd December, whereas the payment 
proved was on the 4th December, after pleading. [And 
of course after suit (a).]] 

White asked to amend, but 

Bovill pointed out that the time for pleading, after 
having been renewed again and again, expired on the 3rd 
December, so that the defence could not have been 
pleaded; and on the morning of the 4th, plaintifls might 
have signed judgment, and the attachment would then 
have been no answer, as there must be execution executed 
to avail against a judgment. 

Erlb, C. J. — Assuming that to be so, then I do not see 
how I can amend. If it had been a mere question of dis- 
continuing without costs (a), that might have been a matter 
for terms of amendment. But as the case now stands it 
seems to go to the defence itself.

wards delayed to examine a witness by commission as 
unable to attend. The rule was only for delay, and the 
cause ought to be tried {a). 

WiLLES, J. — I am of that opinion. The serving the 
rule for a special jury after the previous delays, and serving 
it so lately, could only have been for delay, and was an 
abuse of the process of the Court. 

The cause then proceeded. In the course of the case

him under a commission, but he declined, until his fees

held that he was justified in claiming his lien. 
Ultimately the cause ended in a

The bills of lading, (bearing the condition stated in the 
special plea,) were indorsed to Kearns and Co., wharfingers 
and warehousemen, the real plaintiffs. 

The ship&apos;s agents were Smith and Co., who had before 
unloaded cargoes of Kearns and Co. at the docks. 

On the 22nd January the ship arrived at the docks. 
About eleven o&apos;clock in the forenoon she was at her 
moorings, and began to discharge about noon, but it did 
not appear that any of the plaintiffs&apos; goods were unloaded 
on that day. 

Kearns and Co. were not aware of the ship&apos;s arrival 
until about two o&apos;clock on that day, and could not get the 
Custom-house clearances until about three. As it would 
have taken an hour to get a cheque for the freight cashed 
and pay it to the agents, and get back to the docks, which 
closed at /our, nothing more was done on that day ; but 
Kearns and Co. wrote to the ship&apos;s agents, telling them 



SITTINGS^QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



681 



that next morning they should be at the ship to pay the 
freight and receive their goods into their craft 

The ordinary hours for discharging cargoes at the docks 
in winter were from nine till four. 

On the 23rd January, however, the ship began to un- 
load as early as seven. It did not appear whether any of 
plaintiffs&apos; goods were unloaded before Kearns arrived. 
At half-past nine he came to the dock quay where the 
ship was unloading, brought bis craft alongside ready to 
receive the goods, produced the bills of lading to the 
master, and tendered 250Z. in cash for the freight, the 
total amount of which as claimed was less than 240/., 
and the real amount of which ultimately turned out to 
be 220/. 

The master refused to receive the freight or deliver the 
goods, without the orders of the ship&apos;s agents, who had 
no one else there to receive the freight. 

At that time the plaintiffs&apos; goods were being unloaded 
on the quay, and in spite of Kearns&apos; protest they con- 
tinued to be so unloaded. Shortly afterwards, however, 
the ship&apos;s agents sent to Kearns and Co., offering to deliver 
the goods on payment of freight at estimated weights. To 
this Kearns and Co. assented, the unloading ceased, and 
the goods which had not been landed, and some of those 
which had been were put on board the lighters of Kearns 
and Co., they paying an estimated freight. Next day, 
on the 24th January, Kearns and Co. wrote to the ship*s 
agents that they were paying freight in excess, declining 
to pay longer on an estimated freight, and requiring that 
the rest of the goods should be weighed for freight. Of 
this no notice was taken. 

On the 29th January, plaintiffs&apos; attornies wrote to the 
defendant, the shipowner, demanding the goods, and 
offering to pay the freight. Of this no notice was taken. 

On the 6th February, Kearns and Co. wrote to the 
superintendent of the docks demanding the goods, and he

682 CASES AT THE 

1861. replied that he could only deliver them on production of 
the ship&apos;s agents&apos; release and on payment of dock charges. 

On the 9th February, the defendant, the shipoumer, told 
Kearns and Co. that they could have the goods on pay- 
ment of the freight. On the same day, Kearns and Co. 
demanded the goods of the superintendent of the docks, 
who, however, referred them to the ship&apos;s agents. 

On the 11th February, Kearns and Co. demanded the 
goods of the ship&apos;s agents, who said that Kearns and Co. 
could have them on payment affreight. Kearns and Co. 
asked what the freight was, and Smith and Co. said tkeg 
knew. This Kearns and Co. denied, and required that 
the goods should be weighed. On the same day Kearns 
and Co. wrote to Smith and Co., that they were ready 
to pay whatever was required, and that though they had 
asked that the goods might be weighed, they would, if 
that were refused, pay whatever was claimed. 

On the 14th February, Smith and Co., the ship&apos;s agents, 
sent the freight notes, showing what freight remained due, 
and on the same day Kearns and Co. tendered the amount 
to their clerk, who from some misapprehension refused to 
receive it. On the same evening, however, Smith and Co. 
sent a letter to Kearns and Co., enclosing an order on the 
dock company to deliver the goods to Kearns and Co. 
&quot; free of charge,&quot; on payment of freight only. 

This letter, however, was not received until the next 
day, and on that day, before it was received, the writ in 
this action issued. 

The goods had not been received. The dock charges 
would have come to less than 10/. 

[In the course of the plaintiffs&apos; case, when the main facts 
of the transaction had appeared in evidence, 

CocKBURN,C. J.,said: — The goods having been delivered 
up and the charges waived, there is really no substantial 
claim remaining. The action cannot be grounded on con- 
version, nor are the goods now detained ; and, as to the 



SITTINGS-QUEENS BENCH. 683 

special county there can hardly be real damage. The 1861. 
charges claimed were trifling in amount, and the proper . 
course would have been to pay them under protest, and and Another 
bring an action to recover the money as paid under duress robimson. 
oF goods (a)y and so raise the question of the lawfulness of 
the charges. But it does not seem to be an admissible 
course to refuse to pay the money and then sue for all the 
damage caused by the delay in the delivery, when the 
delivery might have been obtained immediately on payment 
of a trifling sum of money.] 

On the part of the defendant, evidence was given of a 
usage that cargoes of fruit especially, coming by steamers^ 
should he discharged immediately the vessels were ready 
to discharge, and discharge on the dock quays, if the 
consignees were not there with their crafl ready to receive 
the goods. And that it was for the consignees to discover 
when the ships were about to arrive, and be ready to re* 
ceive the cargoes so soon as the vessels were ready to 
discharge. And the ship&apos;s agents were called to prove 
that they knew the day before the ship arrived, that she 
was about to arrive, and that it was known also at Lloyd&apos;s. 
Moreover, they proved that for several seasons their ships 
had unloaded at the London Docks, where this ship dis- 
charged. On the part of the defendant, it was contended 
that Kearns and Co. were too late according to the con- 
dition in the bills of lading. 

On the part of the plaintiffs, it was contended that 
Kearns and Co. were in time with their tender of freight 
on the 23rd, their goods not having then been unloaded, 
and that the ship&apos;s agents were in default in not having 
any one at the ship to receive the freight at that time. 

At the close of the case, 

CoGKBURN, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The great question 
is, whether the condition in this contract, that the goods 

(a) AthmoU V. Wainwright, 2 Q. B. Rep. 837. 



684 CASES AT THE 



1861. shall be taken from the vessel imwudiatefy sbe was ready 

*^&apos;^^ to dischai^e, has been satisfied or not? — for, if not, then 

and Another the defendant was to be at liberty to land the goods at the 

RoBiiisoH. expense of the consignees. And the defence is, that the 

condition was not complied with, and that therefore that 

coarse was taken. 

The first point is, what is the effect of the word &apos;&apos; im- 
mediately&quot; here ? Under ordinary circumstances, when a 
man is called npon by a contract to do an act, and no time 
is specified, he is allowed a reasonable time for doing it ; 
and what is a reasonable time may depend on all the cir- 
cumstances of the case. But here the word used being 
&apos;* immediately,&quot; it implies that there is a more stringent 
requisition than what is ordinarily implied in the word 
*&apos; reasonable&quot; (a). Still, it must receive a reasonable inter- 
pretation, so far that it cannot be considered as imposing 
an obligation to do what is impossible. 

For instance, it could not be reasonable to require that 
the consignee should have craft ready by day and by night, 
and, if the vessel arrived in the night, no doubt it would be 
deemed sufficient to have tlie craft ready at a reasonable 
hour the next morning. And again, there must be time to 
receive the necessary documents and make the necessary 
entries at the Custom-house, and the like. Such is the 
interpretation which, apart from any evidence of actual 
usage, you probably would be disposed to put upon such a 
contract (6). 

In this case, however, it is sought, by extrinsic evidence, 
to give a precise meaning to the term, and it is contended 
that, by tlie practice universally prevailing in cases of 
such contracts as this, the term ** immediately&quot; must be 
taken to mean, that whenever the ship is ready to dis- 

(a) See Hyde ▼. Waits, 12 M. M.&amp;I^. 1()5, as to teDder of goods&amp;W. 254. at a reasonable time, and not by

SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 



685 



charge, the merchant must be there with his craft ready to 
receive the cargo. 

At first sight that might appear to be unreasonable {a), 
the time of arrival being as uncertain as navigation by 
reason of the weather, the winds, or the tides necessarily 
must be, and the shipowner receiving earlier intelligence 
from the master of the expected arrival than the merchant 
is likely to have. But then, on the other hand, it is to be 
borne in mind that this condition is inserted in cases of 
consignments of cargoes perishable in their nature, such 
as fruit, and requiring to be cleared quickly (especially 
when conveyed by steamers) ; and that the shipowner or 
master cannot know to whom the bills of lading have been 
assigned. And perhaps, therefore, practically, it is not 
unreasonable in such cases, that the merchant, making use 
of such means as he may have for hearing of the arrivals 
of vessels, should be bound to get his papers and his en- 
tries passed, and have his craft ready alongside the. ship 
when she is ready to discharge. Such is the usage which 
has been given in evidence, and it is for you to say, 
whether it has been made out, and whether you think it 
reasonable. 

The first question, then, being, what is the construction 
of the term used, whether with reference merely to what 
is reasonable or with reference to the alleged usage ? The 
next question is, whether the plaintiffs complied with it ? 
It is contended for the defendant, that the consignees were 
bound to have been ready when the ship began to dis- 
charge, at noon, on the first day. But it does not appear 
that any part of the plaintiffs&apos; goods were discharged on 
that day, or th^ next morning, before the consignee came. 
The unloading commenced two hours before the regular 
time, of which be was not bound to be aware. And again, 
the ship&apos;s agents had notice that he was coming to tender

the freight and receive the goods, and it is for you whether 
the ship was not being unloaded out of the regular course, 
and whether, on the whole, the consignee did not comply 
with the condition. And even, assuming that he did not 
strictly do so, and was not at the ship so soon as he should 
have &apos;been, it is for you to say whether the defendant, or 
the ship&apos;s agents, took the course which he was entitled to 
take under the circumstances, in having the goods landed, 
when the consignee was ready to receive them. 

Supposing that you consider that the ship&apos;s agents were 
no^ justified in taking that course, and therefore that the 
plaintiffs are entitled to recover, the question remains, to 
what amount of damages are they entitled ? The re^d 
plaintiffs are Kearns and Co., who were entitled to receive 
the goods. Part were received, and the rest might have 
been received on the day the writ issued. Indeed, the 
whole might have been received on payment of the petty 
sum claimed for dock charges, which might have been 
paid under protest, and recovered back, if not justly due. 
And, although it is true that the market had fallen in the 
meantime, and that, ordinarily, the parties entitled to re- 
ceive the goods might recover the loss of profit accruing 
from the fall in price ; yet it is for you to consider whether 
the plaintiffs might not have obtained the goods at once 
on payment of a very small sum, and whether, if so, they 
are entitled to claim the full damages which they might 
otherwise have justly recovered. The freight could have 
been ascertained by them, and the freight and chaiiges 
tendered. If the goods had then been refused, no doubt 
the plaintiffs would have been entitled to the full amount 
of damages ; but, doubtless, the goods would have then 
been delivered, and the injury arising from the delay 
would not have ensued. As it is, it is for you to say 
whether the delay and injury were not brought about 
partly by the course taken on the part of the consignees. 
The jury found the usage as set up by the defendant ;

The question in the cause was, whether a debt of 100/. &quot;^&quot;P&quot;&quot;**^^*&quot; 
due from the father of the defendant, and which had been 
brought into his account, could be recovered by the plain- 
tiff under the circumstances. 

For the plaintiff, it was proved that the defendant took 
to his father&apos;s business, of a fish dealer, in November, 1855, 
and continued to deal with the plaintiff, fish factor, from 
that time. That the course of business was to send in 
weekly invoices : that the first invoice charged the father&apos;s 
debt, 102/. 68. as a balance due, and the invoices for two 
years continuously carried in the account ; the invoices, 
however, being made out simply to &quot; Mr. Nash.&quot; 

In May, 1857, the account stood thus, and it was proved 
that at that time the defendant paid 16/. 3«. 6d., ** in order 
to make an even balance,&quot; and that he promised to pay the 

balance.

Promises by the defendant to pay &quot; the balance&quot; were 
proved by two witnesses, and upon this evidence (a). 

JoycCy for the defendant, submitted that there was no 
case. As a matter of law, no doubt, where several debts 
are due to a creditor, and money is paid generally, he can 
appropriate it. But there is no case which decides that 
a creditor can appropriate monies paid by his debtor to the 
debt of a third party, and that is this case, for there is no 
evidence of any authority to appropriate. 

Shee^ Serjt., for the plaintiff.— This is like the case of a 
partner leaving a firm without notice. It must be taken 
that the defendant being charged with the father&apos;s debt, 
and that being continued as a debt against bim,and the pay- 
ment being credited generally, coupled with the promises 
to pay, he imputed that the monies paid should be taken 
in discharge of his father&apos;s debt ; if he did they were well 
appropriated. 

Joyce, in reply. — ^The defendant never paid more money 
than the goods he received amounted to. He is not re- 
sponsible for the mode in which plaintiff keeps his accounts. 

Blackburn, J, — If the jury are of opinion that the 
money was paid in discharge of the father&apos;s debt, and the de- 
fendant intended that the plaintiff might so appropriate it, 
and that he did so, there being no money left to meet the 
defendant&apos;s debts, the plaintiff must succeed. 

Joyce then called the defendant, who denied that he 
ever assented to the appropriation, or consented to pay the 
balance.

had surcharged against the plaintiff one of the sums paid 
by him to liquidate the loan, although he afterwards 
allowed it. The plaintiff&apos;s evidence was that the defendant 
had used the words in the declaration as equivalent words. 
The defendant&apos;s case, as suggested by the cross-examina- 
tion, was, that the defendant used the words except *&apos; has 
applied them to a private use,&quot; and that his language only 
pointed at an expenditure of parish monies, not authorized 
by the vestry. Both parties agreed that the defendant,

him as honourable and punctual in his dealings.

At the end of the plaintiff&apos;s case,

privileged occasion, but a privileged statement in itself. 
The law requires express malice to overcome the privilege; 
and when the occasion is privileged, and the statement, in 
its matter, privileged also, the law requires evidence of 
malice aliunde, that is, other than the very words com^ 
plained of. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — I shall tell the jary that the occasion 
was privileged ; but that the statement though made on 
such occasion will be unprivileged, if the making it was a 
malicious abuse of the occasion. &apos;They have a right to 
ascertain the real meaning and intention of the plaintiff in 
the words complained of, notwithstanding other words of 
courtesy and kindness. 

If the defendant simply meant to censure the conduct of 
the plaintiff as overseer, in relation to the law proceedings, 
and to the money borrowed for them, and repaid out of

the rates, his statement was privileged by the occasion, 
ir, on the other hand, he availed himself of the oppor- 
tunity afforded him, by the meeting of the ratepayers, to 
bring forward a charge against the plaintiff, not merely of 
exceeding his duty, but of corruptly violating it, by ap- 
plying the parish money to his own private purposes, the 
statement was not privileged, nor was it protected by the 
occasion. If the language of the defendant was entirely 
disproportioned to the circumstances under which he would 
be privileged by the occasion, the jury would be justified, I 
think, in inferring malicious motives, for they only would 
be the motives which would prompt such language; but, if 
it he plain to the jury that the defendant&apos;s language de- 
scribed only the excess of duty without imputing private 
corruption, then I shall tell them, the occasion and state- 
ment were privileged. 

Evidence was then given on the part of the defendant, 
and eventually the plaintiff submitted to a

evidence of a scientific and speculative nature, it might pouibly have been detected, but 
whether practically and by the use of ordinary and reaianable care it ought to have been ob- 
served.

The immediate cause of the accident was, the breaking 

CouHTm*&quot; ^^ ^^^ *y^® ^^ ^^^ ^^^^ leading wheel of the engine. The 
Railway alleged negligence was, in using a tyre which was defective, 
either by the fault of the company originally in the welding 
of it, or which had become defective, in the course of its 
use, so as to have become visible or capable of being de- 
tected on proper examination, and also in not using suf- 
ficient break-power or not properly applying it. 

There was evidence of a longitudinal flaw in the original 
making of the tyre, and also of a transverse flaw or defect 
in the welding. 

It was agreed, however, that the^rs^ defect was not the 
cause of the accident, and that the true cause was, the 
giving way of the iron at the other or transverse flaw — a 
flaw in the welding. But it was suggested that the former 
or longitudinal flaw ought to have attracted attention to 
the tyre, as a sign of weakness. 

And it was suggested also that the use* of the tyre after 
it had been worn down to a certain degree of thinness was 
negligence which had led to the catastrophe. The thinness 
of the tyre of course was apparent, and the evidence was 
contradictory as to whether it was dangerous. As to whe- 
ther the other flaws or defects were visible, there was a 
great contest of testimony. The evidence that they were 
so was scientific and speculative. The evidence that it was 
not so was practical and positive. The accident occurred 
on the 26th of February. The last time the tyre was 
&apos;&apos; turned&quot; was in October, and the wheel had ran constantly 
since without any sign of weakness which had actually 
been seen, or was proved to have been actually visible. 

The trial lasted six days. 

At the close of the case, 

CocKBURN, C. J., thus summed it up to the jury.— The 



SITTINGS- QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 693 

question is, whether the breaking of the tyre resulted from i860, 
any negligence in the defendants or their servants, for ^^&apos;^^ 
which they are responsible ? First, as to the defects in the and Othen 
tyre. They did not manufacture the iron ; the defect in tbe Eabtbrit 
the iron itself was unknown to them, and it is not safd that r^^^&quot;^&quot; 
they are responsible unless the flaw had become, in the Compamt. 
course of use and time, visible. Of this there is no positive 
evidence but such as is purely speculative. It is for you to « 
say whether you are satisfied with it You must deal with 
a case of this kind as practical men. You are entitled to 
expect at the hands of a railway company all that skill and 
care and prudence can do to protect the public against 
danger and accidents, but you must carry that principle 
into application as reasonable men. It is one thing for the 
microscopic eye of science, with the aid of instruments and 
measurements, to detect inequalities or pick out flaws, but 
the practical working of railway business is quite another 
thing, and you cannot expect that a railway company shall 
be from time to time measuring with accurate scientific in- 
struments, or taking down scientific persons to see if there 
is a little inequality here or there. The business of railways 
and of Ufe could not go on if this were required. You 
must, therefore, look at the matter in a reasonable and 
practical point of view, and judge if the indications were 
such as a competent railway servant should and ought to 
have seen ? 

It is indeed admitted that the transverse flaw — the flaw 
in the welding of the tyre — was the cause of the accident. 
It is said that if any part of the machinery used by the 
company has proved defective, the company are bound to 
show its history. But their not being able to do so is not 
in itself evidence of negligence. And this part of the case 
involves two questions. Was the tyre welded by the com- 
pany ? Was there negligence in the welding of it? Can 
it in all cases be concluded that, because there is a defect 
in the welding, that defect implies negligence in the party 



694 CASES AT THE 

1860. who has welded ? If you are of opinion that the cQmpany 

^^^^ welded the tyre, and that there was negligence in the 

9iid Others welding, then^ as the defect in the weld was the cause of 

The Eastern the accident, you can trace it clearly and connect it with 

Railway negligence of the company, and the plaintiffs would be cq- 

CoMPANY. titled to the verdict. 

If they are not responsible for the existence of the flaw, 
then comes the question whether it was visible? The evi- 
dence that it was not so is positive, and it is the evidence 
of the men who had charge of the engine and examined it 
the night before the morning on which the accident oc* 
curred. If you are of opinion that the flaw or crack had 
become visible prior to the accident ; that upon careful ex- 
amination, not with the aid of highly scientific authorities 
and scientific instruments, but on an ordinary, reasonably 
proper and careful examination, such as all feel ought to 
be made before engines are used, on which the safety of a 
whole train may depend, this flaw might have been dis- 
covered, and that either the examination did not take plfice, 
or, if it did, and the flaw was discovered, but the man, 
with careless disregard of his own safety and the safety of 
pthers whose lives and limbs might be involved, treated all 
this with supine or reckless indifference, then undoubtedly 
there is negligence established for which the company are 
and ought to be responsible. It cannot be denied that the 
company are bound to have these examinations conducted 
carefully and properly, and to see that the macl^inery they 
usd&apos;are in working order. But unless you are satisfied that 
the flaw was capable of being detected on such proper exa- 
mination, you ci^nnot hold them liable on this ground. 

Then there arises the question, did the company continue 
to use the tyre after it had been reduced in strength and 
substance below the point at which it was proper to ^8e it ? 
This depends on the former question whether thq flaw was 
visible; for if it were, then a reduction of the thickness and 



SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 696 

substance of the tyre, which would otherwise have been iseo. 

consistent with safety, would, with reference to the flaw, ^^v-^-&apos; 

Stoxkb 
have been improper. Assuming that the flaw was not and Othera 

visible (for if it were it is needless to go further, that being jn^ .eaiterit 

evidence of negligence), was there negligence in using the CouHxiEa 

tyre after it had been so reduced in substance? If there Company. 

was, then, even although they did not know of the latent 

cause of danger, yet as their negligence gave efiect to it, it 

would be, though not the proximate, yet the efficient cause 

of the accident, and would be negligence for which they 

are liable. 

As to whether the tyre had been reduced to an unsafe 
thinness, the evidence that it had been was rather scientific 
and speculative; the evidence that it was not so was 
rather practical. And the general practice in any depart- 
ment of business embracing a large area of practical 
experience, if found up to a given time to have been un- 
attended with danger, is strong evidence that it is a proper 
one. And if you think the practice has been as repre- 
sented, can you say that because in the present instance 
it turns out that the tyre has been pared down to too great 
a degree of thinness, that this is evidence of negligence ? 
If, however, you think there was that degree of thinness 
which made it improper to use the tyre, then you will find 
for the plaintiffs. 

Lastly, even assuming that the accident was not caused 
by negligence of the company&apos;s servants, might it have 
been prevented or mitigated by a better use of break- 
power ? It is not to be disputed, because the universal 
practice of railway companies is an acknowledgment of its 
necessity, as a matter of proper caution and care, that 
break-power ought to be used. Are you of opinion that 
the absence of a second break-van, or the not putting 
the single one in the rear, was negligence on the part of 
the company ? You must consider the question as prac- 
tical men ; and if you think that there was a neglect of 



696 



CASES AT THE 



1860. what might fairly and reasonably have been expected 

^^^&apos;^ froni the railway company for the protection of a train, that 

and Others would be negligence. But then the question would remain 

The Eastern whether it conduced to the accident, i. e. in the sense not 

Railway of baving caused it, but of not having prevented it. This 

Company, depends upon whether, assuming the break-power had 

been better used, it would have prevented or mitigated the 

catastrophe. 

The jury, in answer to specific questions, found, that 
there was no evidence that the tyre was negligently 
welded ; that the neglect had not become visible ; that 
there was no negligence in using the tyre after it had 
become thin; that there was no negligence in not pro- 
viding better break-power; and that, if it had been 
applied, it would not have averted or materially mitigated 
the catastrophe.

CASES AT THE 

1862. In January, 1857, she left Englanc) for Calcutta, an4 
from that time was employed in sailing between Calcutta 
&quot;&quot;p.&apos;*&apos; and China until February, 1859, when the present policy 
BATHLEY. ^^^ entered into, a time policy for a year. In March she 
sailed on a homeward voyage, with a cargo of indigo, 
saltpetre and jute, a species of hemp. At that time it 
appeared that the mast was rotten, that nearly all the 
&apos;^ gear &quot; standing or running were rotten and unsafe, and 
that the deck required re-sheatliing ; that the wood-work 
generally was in a bad state, and the iron-work rusted and 
corroded. In the first two months of the voyage the 
vessel sustained some damage, and in May put into Algoa 
Bay to refit. [Algoa Bay is on the south-east coast of 
Africa, about 600 miles from the Cape, and about the 
same distance from Port Natal. It is an open roadstead, 
the nearest port to it being Simon&apos;s Bay, distant about 
4t30 miles.] While there, it was found that damage had 
been sustained, for which 25 per cent, had been paid by 
the insurers. In July the captain, finding that thorough 
refitting was necessary, requiring a larger outlay than he 
thought proper to incur without consulting the owner, 
went to England for that purpose, leaving the vessel 
riding at anchor in the open roadstead. On the 2nd and 
16th of October heavy gales blew, which sent some vessels 
on shore, and in the log-book, on the 1 7th of October, 
there was an entry that the ship&apos;s deck leaked; but no 
other similar entry occurred, and there was no mention 
that the ship had &quot; strained.&quot; In November the captain 
returned to Algoa Bay, bringing masts, spars,&amp;c. to the 
value of 5,000/., and thereupon the repairs proceeded. 
On the 27th of December the captain&apos;s attention was 
called to a leak, which he said he saw &apos;* abaft the engine- 
room, just inside one of the after compartments,&quot; and 
which he described as a hole- of the size of a small rivet, 
ragged in shape, with a crack going from the upper part, 
and from one of the sides.&quot; This hole the captain caused 




SITTINGS— QUEENS BENCH. |599 

to be plugged with wood, but he said he saw that the iioa 1862. 
plates and rivets in the bottom of the ship were injured ; 
that some of the rivet-heads were off, some near where the 
hole waS| and others under the engines and boilers ; and 
some of the plates were apparently started. The captain 
at once had the ship surveyed^ and the surveyors&apos; report 
recommended that the cargo should be unshipped, and 
the vessel ^&apos; hove down/&apos; in order the better to inspect the 
state of her plates and rivets. The captain then (in 
February) had the cargo taken out and again surveyed, 
and the surveyors reported that, from the bad state of the 
rivets and plates it would be absolutely necessary to have 
the bottom examined externally, before any opinion coulcl 
|t)e formed of the ship&apos;s seaworthiness, and that she could 
not go to sea without being hove down and examined. 
The captain then had her boilers taken out, and advertised 
for tenders for heaving the ship down. Only one tender 
was sent, for the sum of 3,000/., which the surveyors 
advised him not to accept. An offer was made of a hul)c 
for the purpose of heaving down for 1,000/., but this offer 
also the captain declined, even when it vyas repeated 
gratuitously. It appeared from the surveyors&apos; report that 
the operation of heaving down a vessel in an open road- 
stea() would be attended with great danger, and that was 
one of the reasons they urged for not accepting the tender* 
No further survey was made, but the captain applied to 
Lloyd&apos;s agent at Algoa Bay for advice, which was de- 
clined. It did not appear that any one there had recopi- 
mended that the ship should be taken to Simon&apos;s Bay, 
which would have been a safe port. 

No attempt was made to take her there, and on the 1 9th 
February the captaii&gt;made his protest of abandonment, 
and thereupon the hulk of the ship was set up for sale 
and sold for^OO/. The captain came hop^ieand placed him- 
self in communication with the underwriters, several of 
whom had since paid, but the greater number had resisted 




700 CASES AT THE 

1862. ^^^ claim for a total loss, and the other actions had been 
consolidated to abide the reHult of the present one. The 
captain^ after waiting for four months in this country, 
during which time he had not been examined by either party, 
went abroad^ and was there examined by commission. 

The great contest in the case was as to the nature and 
extent of the injury the ship had sustained. The strength 
of the case for the plaintiff was, that the rivets were torn 
and wrenched and the plates loosened by reason of strain- 
ing ill the heavy gales of October, and it was not, on the 
part of the plaintiff, denied at the end of the case, that the 
hole alone might have been repaired ; at all events, sufB* 
ciently so to have reached Simon&apos;s Bay in safety. On the 
part of the defendants, the loosening of the plates and 
rivets was denied, and it was disputed that there had been 
any symptoms of straining. The purchaser of the ship 
was examined on their behalf, and stated that the only 
injury was the hole, and that it could have been repaired 
for 100/. or less. 

But it did not appear that he had attempted either to 
repair or to remove the vessel. The witnesses for the 
defendants placed the hole at the bottom of the well-hole, 
and ascribed it either to the action of the sounding-rod or 
to the corrosive effect of bilge-water. But no satisfactory 
cause was assigned for the hole by the evidence on either 
side. And at the close of the case it seemed to have be- 
come of little importance, seeing that it was not then dis- 
puted that it might have been repaired. The witnesses 
for the plaintiff relied chiefly on what they alleged to have 
been the wrenched state of the rivets and plates, as at once 
showing a deadly injury to the vessel, and one which must 
have been caused by straining and so by perils of the seas. 

The witnesses for the defendants denied that the rivets 
and plates were wrenched, though they stated that they 
were toorn ; and they on the other hand insisted that the 
hole could not possibly have been caused by straining, and 




SITTINGS— QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 701 

that there was nothing which might not be aacribed to 1862. 
wear and tear or to the causes before mentioned. They 
particularly urged that one of the sure signs of straining 
was leaking, and that there was very slight evidence of 
leaking, and none which might not be accounted for by a 
general weakening of the vessel caused by wear and tear 
and general want of repair. And above all, that it was 
impossible that there should be strong straining in the 
plates beneath the engine-room, when there were no signs 
of it elsewhere. 

On all these points there was great contrariety of opinion 
and a great body of contradictory evidence. The trial 
lasted five days. 

At the close of the case, 

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury). — This is one of the most 
important insurance cases ever tried. It raises the ques- 
tioUy under what circumstances a captain is entitled to 
abandon a vessel, so as to give the owner a claim upon 
the underwriters for a total loss ? There are two great 
points for your consideration : — First, whether the captain 
was justified in abandoning the vessel ? Secondly, whether 
the damage which she had sustained arose from ^&apos; perils 
of the seas ?&quot; The plaintiff must satisfy you on both those 
points. 

Upon the first point, the question will be, in effect, 
what would a prudent owner, uninsured, have done in 
similar circumstances ? or, in other words, what would the 
insurers have done, or desired to have done, had they been 
present ? 

There are two cases in which a captain is justified in 
abandoning a ship, and claiming as for a total loss (though 
the ship remains in specie^ and has not been destroyed or 
wrecked), i.e. what is called a con$tructive total loss. 
One case is, where the vessel has been so damaged that 
she cannot proceed, with a due regard to the safety of the 
vessel, or of thosei who have to navigate her, and repairs 




&apos;^02 CASES AT THE 

1862. are physically impossible at the place where she is. The 
other case is, where the repairs, though possible, will, from 
their extent, cost so large a sum that the value of the 
vessel, when repaired, will not be equal to the costs of the 
repairs. Thid latter case, however, does not here arise; 
and the case for the platntiflT is, that the repairs from the 
circumstances were physically impossible. And the ques- 
tion you will have to consider is, whether this was so? 
Thd first question will be as to the extent of the damage: 
the next, what were the means of repair? — First, as to the 
extent of the damage. It has been ascribed partly to the 
hole in the ship&apos;s bottom, but chiefly to the straining of the 
rivets, and the consequent looseness of the plates. The 
evidence as to the leak or hole seeniis clearly to show that 
it could have been repaired, and the counsel for the plain- 
tiff in his reply did not dispute it. The great question, 
therefore, is as to the other head of damage: was the 
ship strained, as alleged on the part of the plaintifiT, so as 
to loosen her rivets and plates ? The surveyors certainly 
recommended that the ship should be &quot; hove down,&quot; to see 
the state of the ship&apos;s bottom ; and one of their reports 
mentions leaking, and speaks of the &apos;&apos;bad state of the 
plates.&apos;&apos; That, however, is consistent with the theory of 
the defendants— that the leakage, except that which arose 
from the hole, arose from the general weakening of the 
vessel owing to wear and tear. Beyond all doubt the case 
must turn on the state of the rivets and plates; and there 
is the evidence of the captain that he saw that they were 
injured from the place where the hole was as far as to tlie 
boilers, and under the engines and boilers. But another 
of the plaintiff&apos;s witnesses described the plates as &apos;&apos;worn,*&apos; 
and said that the state of the rivets might have arisen from 
causes going over some months, and did not ascribe their 
state to straining. It does not appear clearly that any of 
the rivets were started, though there was certainly some 
evidence that they had, and that this would so loosen the 




SITTINGS-QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 703 

plates as to let in water. There id also some evidence that 1862. 
this could only be ascribed to straining of the vessel in a 
storniy and that some of the rivets were off. Next, as to 
the means of repair. Now there is very strong evidence 
that the plates could not be repaired, nor indeed their 
state fully known without heaving down the vessel^ and 
that this was an operation which could not have been 
safely effected at Algoa Bay ; that it could not be done 
without enormous expense and very great peril and risk. 
The surveyors advised the captain not to accept the 
tender^ but it will be for you to say whether he ought to 
have at least availed himself of the free offer of d hulk for 
the purpose? or whether he ought not to have taken the 
ship, or try to take her to Simon&apos;s Bay? No doubt this 
must greatly have depended upon the degree of damage 
done to the ship. But suppose you come to the conclu- 
sion that the ship required thorough examination and re- 
pairs, and that such examination and repairs might have 
been obtained at Simon&apos;s Bay, are you of opinion that the 
captain was right in abandoning the vessel without taking 
her there ? If the vessel required effectual repairs, no doubt 
they could not have been done at Algoa Bay, where it 
could have been impossible to keep the ship hove down, 
without great risk of her going to the bottom. So that if 
the ship required such repairs, they could not have been 
done at Algoa Bay ; the question, therefore, whether the 
captain should have taken the ship to Simon&apos;s Bay de- 
pends partly on the extent of the damage ; partly, also, 
on the means oftahing the ship there, and on the means 
of repairing her there. It is for yon to consider whether 
he should have tried to have her towed there,&amp;nd 
whether, if he got her there, the repairs required could 
have been done. It is for you to consider whether it was 
unsafe to take her to Simon&apos;s Bay, so as to leave the 
captain no alternative but to abandon her where she was. 
It is of great importance that captains and owners should 




704 CASES AT THE 

1862. understand that vessels are not to be lightly abandoned, 
but that it is the duty of the captains to use an honest 
energy, and all possible means to bring the vessel on her 
voyage, and that they are bound to do the best, which a 
prudent owner, uninsured, would have done under the cir- 
cumstances. Did the captain, in this case, do rightly, and 
in the exercise of a sound discretion, in abandoning the 
ship ? If so, the underwriters are liable, if otherwise, they 
are not so. Observe, that the question is, whether the 
captain acted in the exercise of a sound discretion ; not 
merely whether he acted honestly. Are you satisfied that 
he acted rightly, in the exercise of a sound discretion under 
all the circumstances, and after doing all that he ought 
reasonably to have done ? 

But supposing the captain was not wrong in abandoning 
the vessel with reference to the interests of the owner, the 
question remains, whether the damage which the vessel 
had sustained was caused by perils of the seas. The case 
for the defendants is, that the state of the rivets and plates 
arose from wear and tear, for which the underwriters are 
not liable. Whether the injuries arose from external or 
internal causes, they may have been the result of wear and 
tear. Ships will wear out, and it is not against wear and 
tear that the underwriters insure. Therefore, if some of 
the plates and rivets were worn off otherwise than through 
the ship&apos;s being strained by the winds and waves, then, if 
it were by striking against a rock, it would be by perils of 
the seas; if by the action of the sounding-rod, or by the 
corrosive effect of the. bilge- water, it would not be so. 
Observe, the case for the defendants supposes that the 
only leak was in the well-hole; but the case for the 
plaintiff, that there was leakage arising from external 
causes, may equally be true, wherever the leakage was 
elsewhere. Certainly there is evidence for you that the 
damage was caused by perils of the seas; and, lastly, 
assuming that it was so, was it a partial or a total loss? 



SITTINGS— QUEENS BENCH.

There are, therefore, two main questions for you. First, 
whether, (with reference to what a prudent owner, uninsured, 
would have done,) the damage which the ship had sus- 
tained, and the circumstances in which she was placed, 
were such as to justify the captain in abandoning her? 
Next, whether, if so, the damage was the result of perils 
of the seas ? 

Under the second head several questions arise — 

(1). Could the ship have been repaired at Algoa Bay so 
as to proceed, if not to England, at all events to Simon*s 
Bay? 

(2). In the latter view, then, having regard to the means 
of repair at Simon&apos;s Bay, ought the captain to have taken 
the ship there? 

(3). Was the damage the result of wear and tear or 
perils of the seas? 

(4). If you should find that it was the result of wear and 
tear, was it while the vessel was lying moored at Algoa 
Bay after the month of June? That is, in consequence of 
the detention there.

The dispensary had been established in 1851 by volun- 
tary contributions and subscriptions, and the defendants put 
themselves forward as the medical officers, and appeared to 
have been, in fact, the principal promoters. They were not 
elected or appointed by any body of subscribers, but Uiey, 
in effect, appointed themselves, and they concurred in ap- 
pointing others, who attended to the ordinary internal 
jinanagement, they themselves acting as visiting medical 
officers. There was a committee of management formed 
by all the medical officers, of which the defendants con- 
tinued to be members until 1857. There was a banker&apos;s 
account opened in 1854, upon which, by a letter signed 
by the two defendants, cheques were to be drawn by any 
two directors, countersigned by the honorary secretary.* 
One of the defendants had been honorary secretary and 
the other honorary treasurer. Orders for drugs,&amp;c. were 
written on printed forms, headed &quot; Blenheim Street Dis- 
pensary,&apos;&apos; signed by the resident medical officers on behalf 
of the committee, and addressed to the plaintiffs, who had 
supplied all the drugs from the commencement. No orders 
were produced signed by the defendants, but there was an 
order-book in which duplicate orders were written, and 
this book was seen from time to time by the defendants 
and the other members of the committee, who also saw 
the banker&apos;s book from time to time. It was not denied 
that the defendants were aware of the course of business, 
and of the supply of drugs by the plaintiffs on orders 
written as above mentioned, *&apos; on behalf of the committee.&quot; 
Sums had been paid to the plaintiffs on account of drugs 
supplied in 1851 and 1852; but a balance remained due 
on the account for 1 852. No further payment was made 
until the end of 1856 ; and frequent applications were made 
by the plaintiffs for payment ; the defendants replied that 



SITTINGS^QUEEN&apos;S BENCH. 707 

they had no funds of the institution in hand ; in answer to i862. 
which the plaintifTs from time to time suggested a recourse ^-^&quot;^v-^^ 
to balls, concerts, fancy fairs, and the like. Resort had and Another 
been had to such means, and a sum of 400/. raised, which, ashton 
however, had been applied to the payment of a sum of *nd Another. 
money for the purchase of the lease of the premises, for 
which the defendants had made themselves, in writing, 
personally responsible. It appeared that the subscriptions 
and donations had not left funds available to meet the 
demand in respect of drugs. In various printed circulars, or 
appeals, the defendants represented that there was a large 
debt due for drugs. 

In January, 1857, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendants 
a letter, inclosing their account, commencing with a 
balance due on the account for 1862, and expressing 
jthemselves in these terms: &apos;&apos;This state of things is at 
variance with all hunnessy and we have decided to decline 
supplying your institution from this year, unless a satis- 
factory arrangement can be made for an early payment for 
the future, and for a gradual but certain liquidation of the 
outstanding debt.&quot; The defendants thereupon paid 30/. 
generally on account, and signed the following memo- 
randum : &apos;&apos; We, the undersigned medical officers,&amp;c. 
hereby guarantee and engage to pay you for any drugs 
you shall supply to this institution within one month from 
the end of the quarter/&apos; - No further payment, however, 
{laving been made on the old account, the plaintifis, in 
November, 1861, brought the present action. 

For the plaintiffs it was urged that the defendants had 
never said a word to negative personal liability. 

For the defendants it was urged that the plaintiffs had 
never intimated that they looked to their personal liability. 
It was contended, on behalf of the defendants; that the 
plaintiffs must be taken to have looked to ihe funds of the 
institution. 

The defendants acted all along gratuitously.

G&gt;CKBUHNy C. J. (to the jury). — It is not disputed that 
the defendants were aware of the course of dealing, so 
that they must be taken to have been parties to the orders 
given to the plaintiffs &apos;&apos; on behalf of the committee/&apos; of 
which the defendants were members. 

It is not denied that primd facie this would make them 
liable to the plaintiffs. 

The defence is, that though the committee gave the 
orders, the understanding of the parties was that those 
who gave the order should not be liable, but that the 
plaintiffs should look only to the funds of the institution, 
they knowing that the defendants acted gratuitously and 
with only casual sources of supply derived from public 
charity. 

Do you see your way to that conclusion ? That is, that 
the defendants were only to be liable out of such funds as 
they might have in their hands for the purpose of paying 
for these supplies. 

The plaintiffs deny that they supplied the goods on 
such an understanding. And what is there to show that 
they did? On the other hand, do not the letters, kc 
rather imply the reverse ? The engagement entered into 
in 1857 is for an ** early&quot; payment for future supplies, 
not merely for payment. There is nothing to militate 
against the plaintiffs&apos; claim, in the fact that they should 
have suggested in relief of the defendants some appeals to 
public charity to raise funds. This was natural enough; 
knowing, as the plaintiffs did, that the defendants were 
acting gratuitously, but it is far from implying that they 
looked only to the funds (a). The same remark applies to,

there had been any orders by or oo 
behalf of the defendant, and must 
be supposed to have been meant of

On the 19th of May the derendants found that their

informed the plaintiffs of this, and desired them to charter 
another vesseL 

On the 12th of August the plaintiffs accordii^ly char- 
tered the Angnste at Riga, a ship which would carry 477 
loads, the freight being 24«. per load. 

There was positive evidence on the part of the plaintiffs 
that they could not have got a smaller vesseL 

There was some proof on the part of the defendants that 
there were a great number of vessels at Riga, but no 
positive proof that the plaintiffs could have got a smaller 
one. 

On the 5th of August the Wittaw, the ship originally 
chartered, sailed from Cardiff for Riga, so that she would 
not have got to Riga before September. 

The AugusU was a month loading at Riga, during 
August and September. 

The plaintiffs did not give the defendants any notice of 
the substituted charter. The post would have taken about 
a month to have brought an answer; but there was a 
telegraphic communication, by which an answer could 
have been got in a day or two. It did not appear that 
the defendants could or would have used .the surplus 
space on board the substituted ship; nor did it appear 
that they could not have done so. 

In October the Auguste reached Liverpool, and the 
defendants were informed of the tonnage of the substi- 
tuted ship, and compensation was claimed, on the footing 
of the difl&apos;erence of freight, not only on the tonnage of the 
first ship, but on the whole tonnage of the substituted and 
larger vessel, giving credit for the profit on the sale of the 
surplus cargo carried.

CocKBURN, C. J. (to the jury).~The utmost which the 
plaintiffs can claim is the difference of the freights on the 
whole of the cargo of the substituted ship, giving credit 
for the profit on the surplus cargo carried. To that they 
are entitled, If you are satisfied that they could not have 
found a smaller ship ; for in that case they could not get 
the 300 tons carried, except at the cost of the freight of 
the 477 tons ; and it was for the defendants* freight that 
the space should be used (as the freight would have to be 
paid)j so that they might have the benefit of the profit on 
the sale of the surplus cargo carried. If you think either 
that the plaintiffs might have got a smaller vessel, or that 
they improperly neglected to give the defendants notice of 
the substituted charter, so as to give him the option of 
using the surplus space, you may find for th^ defendants ; 
otherwise, for the plaintiffs, for the sum claimed.

the words related.] 
Plea : not guilty. 

Shee^ Serjt., and C. Russell for the plaintiff. 

Brett and Aspinall for the defendant. 

In September, 1860, the plaintiff^ as owner, insured the 
ship and cargo at Liverpool for 3,500/., on a voyage to 
Madras, and the defendant was among the underwriters. 

On the 8th of September she sailed, and on the 9th re- 
turned, making water. From that day till the 18th of 
September she was under repair, and then re-started on 
her voyage. In February she was at Rio, having put in 
there in distress, and the captain made a protest as to her 
condition, describing her as having made water the very 
day she set sail. The plaintiff then claimed to abandon 
her, as a total loss, on the ground that the cost of repairs 
would exceed her value. Correspondence ensued, in which 
the underwriters acknowledged a liability for a partial, but 
refused to recognize a total, loss, or to accept the proposed 
abandonment. Thereupon the plaintiff wrote to his agent 
at Liverpool the letter referred to by the defendant, in 
which, after stating that the cost of repair would be greater 
than the value of the vessel, he went on thus : &apos;&apos; Therefore 
if the underwriters will not consent to the abandonment, 
they will ultimately be more out of pocket, because their 
risk does not cease until after the vessel reaches Madras, 
and in the meantime other disasters may occur. Please 
explain this to the underwriters, and let us know their re- 
ply and what they propose to do. In case they refuse, ask 
for funds to pay the expenses for repairs.&quot; This letter was 
shown to the underwriters, and, among others, to the de- 
fendant. They declined to accept the abandonment or pay 
for expenses, and a sum of 4,500/. was taken up on bot- 
tomry, out of which the ship having been repaired, in April, 
3ailed for Madras. She was forced to put in at Port Louis,

pairing, and abandoned. The plaintiff then claiming as for 

a total loss, sent the papers to one Horton at Liverpool, in 

order to receive the money. The underwriters disputed the 

claim, and in June, 1861, Horton saw defendant about it. 

The defendant was disposed to pay seventy-five per cent, 

but denied a total loss. After this he spoke the words 

complained of in the first count, when speaking to Horton 

on the subject. The plaintiff then came to ask him for an 

explanation, and the defendant, no one else being present, 

said to him, &quot; You refer to your letter to Munns. Well, 

you did write to that effect. I have seen the letter and I 

have a copy of it.&quot; When challenged to produce it he 

said he had mislaid it. This was the utterance charged in 

the second count. 

It appeared that, since the speaking of the words, the 
underwriters had not settled the claim, requiring the plain- 
tiff to give up all claim, whether as to ship or cargo, for 
seventy-five per cent., and to guarantee them against any 
claim of the bottomry bondholders ; the ship having been 
saved. 

Horton, being called for the plaintiff, and having stated 
that the defendant had desired to see all the documents 
relating to the ship, 

JBrett was cross^xamining as to whether the defendant 
had not desired to see the plaintiff&apos;s letter to his agent 
(with a view to set up the point as to privileged communi- 
cation); but 

CocKBURN, C. J., said the defendant had no right to re- 
quire that ; it was not like a letter from the master to the 
owner ; it was merely a letter from the owner to his home 
agent, and would be, moreover, in the possession of the 
agent Moreover, the defendant professed to have not only 
seen it, but to have had a copy of it. 
At the close of the case for the plaintiff, 
CocKBURN, C. J., pointed out that there was no proof of 




714 CASES AT THE 

1862. the special damage. The settlement had stood still afUr 
the slander, but it was post hoc, nan propter hoc. 

Aspinall objected that, as the words were laid, there 
being no innuendoes nor inducement, it did not appear 
whether they were actionable, nor how they aftecled the 
character of the plaintiff as a merchant, and the special 
damage was negatived. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — ^The want of innuendoes or induce- 
ment can be aided by amendment, as the evidence shows 
that the words were spoken under such circumstances as 
clearly to convey an imputation that the plaintiff meant, 
by dishonest means, to get a sum of money as for a total 
loss, to which he was not fairly entitled. 

Brett submitted that there was no publication to support 
the second count, no one but the plaintiff baring heard the 
words. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — No doubt the substantial question is 
as to the first count, as to the words spoken to Horton. 

Brett submitted that the words were privileged. Horton 
was acting as agent for the plaintiff; the defendant for 
himself and the other underwriters; and in the course of the 
discussion between them the defendant stated a supposed 
fact, detrimental to the plaintiff&apos;s claim, and which was 
strictly relevant, and so privileged. 

CocKBURN, C. J. — There may, no doubt, be such a pri- 
vilege, but when a man makes a pecuniary claim on 
another, the other has no right to traduce his character in 
order to get him to lower his demand. However, as the 
question of privilege will depend on the whole character of 
the case as it appears upon the whole evidence, I shall re* 
serve my ruling upon it until the evidence is closed. Do 
yon call witnesses ? 

Brett desired to have the ruling on the case as it stood ; 
but

but in that way they appeared to have come a little into 
collision, and there was a coolness between them ^vhen 
they met, which, however, seemed to disappear, and in 
consequence, just before the plaintiff left the hotel, he 
sent the book as a gift to the defendant. The plaintiff 
heard nothing more about it until he found the &apos;&apos;protest&quot; 
published in the Medical Circular, and sent also to the 
College of Surgeons, of which he was a member. There 
was no evidence as to how this protest came to be drawn 
up, nor by whom ; and though it purported to be signed 
by several persons (not including the defendant), none of 
them were called as witnesses. It was proved that after 
the publication the defendant had said at the hotel, &quot; If he 
(the plaintiff) had written of me what I have written of

conveyance, making it by some mistake a conveyance only 
of the equity of redemption. The draft was sent by him 
direct to tlie plaintiff, who observed the mortgage, and 
was told that it would be paid off out of the purchase- 
money before the conveyance was completed, and there- 
upon the mistake* was corrected, and the amended draft 
taken by the defendant himself to the plaintiff himself 
The draft assignment recited the leases on which the lands

were held&gt;showing the dates of them, whereby, by means 1861 
of computation, it could be ascertained how much of the 
respective terms would be then unexpired. It did not 
appear, however, that the plaintiff had made any such 
computation, nor that he had read the draft ; and although 
his daughter, who was present on the occasion when the de- 
fendant brought it, asked some questions, it did not appear 
that her attention or her father&apos;s had been directed to this 
particular matter, or that either of them asked any ques- 
tion about it; nor did the defendant allude to it. 

Tbe advertisementf it will be observed, represented the 
lease as having twelve years to run from Lady-&lt;lay, 1860; 
i. e. eleven years from Lady-day, 1861. 

The agreement (which was for 251. lees than the sum 
asked by the advertisement) mentioned the lease as having 
about eleven years unexpired. 

In point of fact the leases had then only about nine years 
to run. 

The defendant having mortgaged tbe leases in 1866, had 
not seen the deed since then, i. e. for a period of about 
five years. 

But, on the other hand, it appeared in the course of the 
case that he had on a former occasion put up the leases 
for sale by an advertisement, making tbe same misstate- 
ment as to the duration of the term, and bad been informed 
of the mistake, but had (it will be seen) tyain put forward 
the same misrepresentation. 

The purchase was completed and the full price paid. 

In July, 1861, the plaintiff found out the true facts, and 
claimed compensation from the defendant, which was re- 
fused (on the ground that the leases had been disclosed on 
the draft deed), whereupon this action was brought. 

It appeared that on the oral negotiations previous to the 
agreement, the defendant had said that the term to run 
was &quot; about eleven years.** 

The plaintiff could not deny that he had read the draft 




720 CASES AT THE 

1861. deed, but believed he had not And his evidence was, 
that on the completion of the purchase the deed was not 
read over. 

The plaintiff had no other attorney in the matter than 
the company&apos;s solicitor, who prepared the deed ; the evi- 
dence for the plaintiff being, that the defendant told them 
he would state ail particulars to him, and that they, the 
defendant and his daughter, need not trouble themselves 
about the matter. 

The party who had told the defendant the true duration 
of the term was called for the plaintiff and stated, that 
thereupon the defendant asked him to name a price, and be 
offered only 225Z., being lOL less than the plaintifF had 
now paid. The defendant, however, denied that he had 
been told the term was less than eleven years, and swore 
he did not know it 

The attorney for the company was called on behalf of 
the defendant, and stated that his attention was never 
called to any complaint as to the duration of the term, and 
that he had sent the draft to the plaintiff, that he might 
consult an attorney. But it appeared that the attorney 
did not see the agreement until the assignment was exe- 
cuted. 

Shee, Serjt., on behalf of the defendant urged, that there 
was no evidence that the plaintiff made the purchase on 
the faith of the representation, having an opportunity of 
ascertaining the truth. 

Hayes, Serjt., for the plaintiff contended, that the only 
question was, whether the defendant made the representa- 
tion, knowing it to be false ; but 

CocKBURN, C, J., left to the jury three questions : — 

1. Was the misrepresentations made as alleged? 

2. By means of it, was the plaintiff induced to give a 
greater sum of money ? 

3. Was it made by the defendant with a knowledge that 
it was false ?

CocKBURNy C. J.y ruled that as the memorandum was 
wholly silent as to what work it referred to, that was a 
latent ambiguity which required to be explained by parol 
evidence. 

Such evidence was accordingly given on both sides, and 
it appeared that the plaintiff^ who could not read writing* 
did not understand that the memorandum applied to both 
the cellars, but that the defendant understood that it 
did ; and both the cellars, which were contiguous, were 
paved in precisely the same way, at the same time, and so 
the same job. 

Supposing the memorandum applied to the whole of the 
work, nothing would be due to the plaintiff in money ^ ex-

the defendant told him he was coming to seize his goods

in writing, requiring payment within half an hour of the 
time when it was served. The plaintiff protested against 
the notice, and pressed for time until the next day, at least 
that he might get the money. But the defendant would

them. The plaintiff&apos;s business was then stopped^ and he 
had been oUiged to assign his effects in trust for creditors. 
It did not appear whether, or how soon, the plaintiff could

(o) Thb seems the general rule, 
even where vindictive damages are 
not admissible. Where, indeed, the 
defendant was etUitUd to seise, and 
it is a mere question of taking the 
wrong goodi, as in the case of a 
distress on goods privileged, the 
damages may be merely nominal 
{Harvey v. Pocock, 11 M.&amp;W. 
740). But where the defendant 
had no right to take the goods at 
all, even although the plaintiff had 
already directed them to be sold, 
he may recover the full value, and 
nut merely the sum they realized 
{LockUy V. Pye, 8 M.&amp;W. 133). 
So where the goods might have 
been taken if tktwhert^ as where 
they are taken out of the jurisdic- 
tion, the owner may recover the 



full value, and not merely the da- 
mage he has sustained by their 
being taken in a wrong place 
(Sawell V. Champion^ 6 Ad.&amp;E. 
407). And a similar principle 
would seem to apply, where, 9b 
here, they were taken at the wrong 
time^ for non comtat^ that if proper 
notice had been given, they would 
have been taken at all. And it is 
not for a mere wrongdoer to put 
the plaintiff to the proof that he 
could have got the money. (The 
case of a distress within the five 
days is exceptional, by reason of 
the statute.) If there were, more- 
over, circumstances of harshness in 
the case, the jury roigKt give vin- 
dictive damages far beyond the full 
value ( Williams v. Currie, 1 C. B.

(except that the notice was defined

the assignor cannot (apart from pin- 
dktioe damages) recover even the 
?alue of the goods, but only the 



measure of bis limited interest 
therein {Brieriy r. KeadaU^ 17

SOLOMON V. BARKER. 

Action against brokers for carelessly selling the 
plaintiff&apos;s goods under a proper price. The first couot 
stated that the plaintiff employed the defendants as brokers 
for reward to value and sell certain feathers in the usual 
and customary manner. 

Averment: that the defendants received the feathers 
to sell on these terms. Breach : that they did not value 
the same, nor sell them in the usual and customary manner, 
but sold them without valuing them, and not in the usual 
and customary way, but so negligently, that they were 
sold at a much less and lower price than they otherwise 
could and ought to have sold for. 

Second count, that the plaintiff employed the defendants 
for reward to get certain feathers properly valued, and to 
submit the valuation to the plaintiff; and if the valuation 
were approved of, then to sell them at a price not less than 
that at which they were so valued. Breach: that the 
defendants sold them without a price being first put 
upon them, or approved of by the plaintiff, and so that 
they sold for a less price than they ought to hav6 been 
sold for. 

Third count, that the plaintiff employed the defendants 
for reward to value the feathers, and submit the valuation 
to him. Breach : that they did not value,&amp;c.

On the 6th of August the plaintiff saw the defendants, 
colonial brokers, and engaged them to sell the feathers in 
question, [There was a contest of evidence as to what 
then took place, he stating ^hat they were to make and 
submit to him a valuation or estimate of the price before 
selling, and they stating that he left them to do the best 
they could.] On the 12th of August he sent them the 
feathers, which were in two cases, fastened up. Next 
day the cases were opened in his presence, and the feathers 
were weighed. They were of various kinds, white, grey 
and black, of which the white were the most valuable* 
There were some of each colour in each case, and in dif- 
ferent proportions. They were not weighed separately in 
his presence, but previously to the sale the quantity of 
each kind was weighed by the defendants&apos; foreman, and a 
note of the weights, made. The defendants had a sale on 
the 14th, and put the feathers in the catalogue for that 
sale, sending the plaintiff notice of the sale, which, how- 
ever, he denied receiving. The sale was, as usual, by 
public auction, and the feathers were exposed for the 
inspection of the buyers on the morning of the sale, in the 
usual way. The defendants did not make any particular 
valuation of the feathers, though they stated that they 
formed a kind of notion in their own minds as to the pro- 
bable selling value. They admitted that it was usual to 
make and send to the seller an estimate of the value in 
order to enable him to fix a reserved price, and he swore 
that they had promised in this case to do so. The feathers 
were sold in the usual way, not by weight, but in the 



728 CASES AT THE 

1862. bulk^ the buyers looking at them as they lay exposed, 
^^&quot;^ each kind by itself, forming their own notion of the weight 
V. and value, and bidding for each lot of each different kind 

or colour at so much for the lot, taken in the lump. 

The sale produced 121/., and a sale note was seat to 
the plaintiff on the same day. He at once complained of 
the sale, and (as he swore) complained that an estimate of 
the value had not been sent to him. The defendants pro- 
mised to try if they could get the feathers back from the 
buyer, if the plaintiff would pay what he wanted for his 
bargain. But the buyer, next day, resold to other persons 
for 200/., and they wanted 20/. for their bargain. The 
feathers, therefore, could not be got back, and the defend* 
ants, on the 22nd of August, sent in their account of the 
sale to the plaintiff, charging 1/. 9«. for commission, and 
making the net produce 119/, On the 26th of August 
the plaintiff&apos;s attorney wrote to the defendants, declining 
to accept the sale, and demanding compensation, on the 
ground that they had sold much under the real value, and 
also without sending to him before the sale an estimate of 
the value, so as to enable him to fix a reserved price. 
[The buyer was now called for the defendants, and stated 
that he had estimated the value of the feathers at 170/. 
This, however, was his estimate not of a buying but of a 
sellinff price, and he said he should not have given so 
much. He admitted that he had got the feathers at a 
lower price than he had expected to have to give for them, 
and accounted for this by the fact that they had not been 
freed from the pepper which was always put in foreign 
feathers (to preserve them from vermin), and which was 
usually beaten out before they were sent to the brokers 
for sale. He accounted for having so soon resold the 
feathers at such a great advance of price by supposing that 
there was some sudden demand for them.] It was ad- 
mitted on both sides that the price of feathers varied very 
frequently and very suddenly, in consequence of changes 




SITTINGS--QU££N&apos;S BENCH. 729 

of fashion and other causes. The plaiDtiflTs witnesses, 
however, valued the feathers at between 300/. and 4002. 

The total weight of the feathers was about sixty-four 
pounds; and though there was some difference in the 
evidence as to the weights of each kind, there were between 
seven and eight pounds of white, the value of which ap- 
peared to be about 16/. per pound, which alone would 
come to 120/., or about as much as the whole were sold 
for. [There was an error in the first advertisement, which 
stated the total weight to be sixty-four ounces instead of 
pounds.] The defendants had not endeavoured at all 
to estimate the value of each kind or colour of feathers, 
and their rough estimate of the value of the whole was 
140/. When the plaintiff remonstrated with them for 
selling at so low a price, without sending him an estimate 
or catalogue, they said something about a &quot; mistake,&quot; but 
it was not clear whether this referred to the omission to 
send the estimate or the catalogue, or the selling at such 
a price. 

Blackburn, J. (to the jury). — Whether the defendants, 
as brokers, did their duty in the sale depends, in the first 
place, upon the terms on which they were employed to 
sell. If nothing was specially stipulated or directed, then 
it must be taken that they were employed to sell upon the 
ordinary terms. In that view, they were bouiyl to employ 
due care and diligence, but would not be liable for mere 
mistake without negligence. They would not be liable, 
therefore, merely for a mistake in not understanding that 
they were to send the plaintiff an estimate. But if they 
were directed to fix a price, and did not fix any, then they 
would be liable. And so, if there was nothing said on the 
subject, but it is part of the ordinary duty of brokers to 
fix a price before a sale, as they did not do so, they 
would be liable. Of course, if the defendants were em- 
ployed absolutely to sell at the next sale, there would be 
no obligation to send the plaintiff a catalogue or estimate. 




730 CASES AT THE 

But even in that case the defendants would be bound, as 
brokers, to use ordinary care and diligence. And they 
would be liable if they sold the goods at a sacrifice, and 
threw them (so to speak) away. Hence diey were boand 
to make some estimate of the price or value for their own 
guidance in the sale. And if they did not do so, and thus 
sold under the fair value, they are liable. The question is, 
whether they used due care and diligence when they sold 
the goods for the price they took. It is not a question 
merely of price or value, but whether they were guilty of 
negligence in not getting a better price, and in not using 
the ordinary care to do so. If you think they did not use 
due care and diligence, what damage has the plaintiff 
sustained ? 

The jury found a verdict for the 
plaintiff, damages 93/.

The accident happened on the 28th of January, 1861. poao 
The train was an express train, which consisted of ten ^^^ iI^hdon 
carriages and a break-van. The break-van, instead of and South 
being placed at the end of the line of carriages, was placed Railway 
between the fourth and fifth. The train (which was going ^^^^^^&apos; 
at the rate of thirty miles an hour) proceeded on its journey 
safely until it arrived at a part of the line between Wim- 
bledon and Maldon, near the Epsom Junction, when one 
of the wheels of the tender got off the line, and upon 
going round a curve which is in the road at that spot three 
carriages flew off the line and fell down the embankment, 
and shortly afterwards two flew off in the opposite direc- 
tion. In one of those carriages the plaintiff was sitting, 
and he was thrown about very violently. Two of his ribs 
were broken, his shoulder was put out, his bladebone had 
suffered a severe blow, and he was otherwise materially 
injured. The grounds of negligence of which the plaintiff 
complained were, first, that the tyre of the wheel which 
went off the line was in an improper state ; secondly, that 
the train was going at too fast a rate ; thirdly, that the 
gauge between the two lines of metals at the curve was in 
some places wider than at others ; and, fourthly, that the 
break-van was in an improper place. 

The defence was, that twelve minutes before the trains 
passed in safety the place where the accident occurred, 
and therefore that the line there could not have been in 
an unsafe state. That the accident was not occasioned by 
the wheel of the tender getting off the line, but by one of 
the carriages flying off. As to the second ground of com* 
plaint, the defendants contended that the train was an 
express train, and was not going at a greater speed than 
thirty miles per hour. As to the third, that the metals 
would always vary, and that on the best managed railways 
they would always be found to vary ; and fourthly, that it 
was only a matter of opinion where the break- van should

V. put nearer to the end than it had been. 

AND South ^^ evidence for the plaintiff was, for the most part, 
Rai&apos;lwat scientific and speculative; the object being to show 
CoMPAMT. that the accident arose from the shifting of tbe tyre 
(through its being loose and worn down), combined with 
the irregularity of the gauge, and the speed at which the , 

train was going over it ; neither ground being relied on by i 

itself: but the case for the plaintiff being that there was | 

negligence in each matter, and that all three combined to &apos; 

cause the accident, which was aggravated by the defect of 
break-power. 

For the defendants it was proved that, as regarded the 
tyre, practical experience had proved that it need not be , 

replaced until worn down below seven-eighths of an inch, 
and that it had not been worn below an inch. Every car- i 

riage, at the end of each journey, was examined and 
sounded. And the engineer who had charge of this engine 
was called, and proved that it had worked down to this | 

journey in question without any indication of danger. As 
regarded the state of the line, evidence was given on the \ 

part of the company to show that they had every portion 
of it constantly inspected, to see that it was in good work- 
ing order, and that this particular portion had been recently 
so inspected, a train having also passed in safety over it a 
few minutes before the one in question. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — The action is grounded on 
negligence. Negligence is not to be defined^ because it in- 
volves some inquiry as to the degree of care required, and 
that is the degree which the jury think is reaeonahly to be 
required from the parties, considering all the circumstances. 
The railway company is bound to take reasonable care; to

the safety and convenience of their passengers. If they 
have done so they have done their duty, and are not guilty

oF negligence ; if they have failed in their duty^ and their 1862. 
negligence has caused the injury^ then .they are liable in 
the action. You are to consider what is reasonable care, . «. 
and whether they have used the proper precautions. They ^^^ south^ 
are entrusted with most important interests, with human r &quot;i^™** 
lives, and a jury may reasonably require an amount of care Compamt. 
proportioned to those interests. At the same time a jury 
would not be entitled to expect the utmost care that could 
possibly be conceived, or the highest possible degree of 
skill. It is to be borne in mind that railways themselves 
are of recent introduction, and that their management is a 
matter of experience and of practical knowledge which 
increases day by day. It is not to be expected that the 
directors shall at once have in use every invention or dis- 
covery of science. It is sufficient if they use every pre* 
caution in known practical use, for the safety and conve- 
nience of the passengers. Both objects must be looked to. 
It is easy to conceive a precaution, for example, a slower 
rate of speed, which would add a very small degree of 
security, while it would entail a very great degree of incon- 
venience. And a company ought not to be found guilty 
merely because they possibly might have done something 
more for safety, at a far greater sacrifice of convenience. 

It has been said that the mere fact of an accident is 
some evidence of negligence, until the company show that 
they have done all that was reasonably possible to do to 
avoid it (a). That question does not arise here, for there is 
express evidence of negligence, amply sufficient to call for 
an answer^ and there has been a great deal of evidence in 
answer. 

The case has been rested on several grounds of negli- 
gence, and if any one is sustained the plaintiff will be en- 
titled to the verdict; but, on the other hand, as several

grounds, each insufBcient, will not, put together, suffice, 
unless you find that one or other of them is sustained, you 
ought not to find for the plaintiff. First. Was there negli- 
gence in using the centre wheel, and if so, did that negli- 
gence cause the injury? Secondly. Was there negligence 
in the speed of the train over that part of the line where 
the accident occurred, and if so, did that negligence cause 
damage? (a) Thirdly. Was there negligence in respect of 
the break-power, either as being insufficient or badly placed, 
and if so, did that negligence cause damage? If you are 
satisfied on any one of these grounds of negligence, find for 
the plaintiff. 

As regards the state of the lines, it seems to me that, as 
far as human precautions can go, the company have agents 
to act for them who would find out if the way was out of 
order. There seems to be abundant supervision. 

As respects the alleged inequalities in the gauges, you 
must draw a distinction between mathematical accuracy 
and practical utility. It seems to stand to reason that a 
variation of half an inch, spread over 100 yards, beginning 
and ending in n6thing, could hardly be perceptible in re- 
spect of the trains passing over the line. But these are 
matters for you to judge of. 

If the line was in fair working order there was no negli- 
gence in allowing the trains to go over it With regard to 
the break-power, weigh what is the known practical use 
with reference to safety and convenience.

6tore8,&amp;c., valued at 13,000/.&quot; There were no formal words 
of delivery on the policy, nor are such words usual in the 
execution of policies by the company. 

On the 25th April, the plaintiff&apos;s broker efiected policies 
on the ship for 5,000/., which, however^ were cancelled. 
He then, by the plaintiff&apos;s order, proposed, by his manager, 
one Fenn, to effect a policy for 2,000/., at eight guineas 
per cent. Before the policy was made out, he, on the 30th 
April, applied to alter his proposal to 1,000/., at ten guineas 
per cent. This was accepted, and a &apos;&apos; slip&quot; was accordingly 
handed in for the policy. This was the policy in question, 
which was made out and duly signed and sealed by the 
directors, and given out to a clerk in their office ready for 
delivery to the broker, who was, on the date of the policy, 
the 1st May, debited with the stamp and premium in his 
account with the company. No application was ever made 
by the broker or by the plaintiff for the policy until the 
day of the settlement of the monthly account, and it re- 
mained in the possession of the company. The company 
were used to make up their accounts with the broker every 
month, and the premiums were deemed due on the 8th of 
every month ; and on the 8th June, the company, in due 
&apos; course of business, sent to the plaintiff&apos;s broker a dehU note 
—&apos;&apos;To premiums for May, 1861, 100/, less by 10 per cent 
discount, 90/.; adding stamp, 2/.; 92/. due June 8th, 1861.&quot; 
To which was added, ** The discount will be forfeited in

the &apos;&apos;Blip&quot; should be carried out, or the policy effected. 1862. 
The company&apos;s manager thereupon (on the 14th June) 
agreed to cancel the policy and return the premium ; and 
it was arranged that the broker&apos;s clerk should have it for the 
purpose of getting a return of the spoiled stamp, previously 
to which the cancellation was to be indorsed on the back 
of the policy, in accordance with the usual practice of the 
company, in order to avoid an objection raised by the 
Stamp Office to erasure or defacing of the deed. Accord* 
ingly, the defendant&apos;s manager drew a cheque for 90/., 
the amount of the premium (less discount), and passed it 
through the cash-book to the credit of the broker ; and 
then indorsed a memorandum on the back of the policy in 
these terms :— &quot; Settled ; and a return of the whole of the 
premium on the within policy, and cancelled this in- 
surance; no risk attaching thereto. 1,000/.; viz. 1,000/. 
at ten guineas per cent; less discount, 90/.&quot; This was 
signed by two directors in the usual way ; and it appeared 
by the evidence for the defendants that this was the mode 
of cancelling the company&apos;s policies always adopted. 

The broker&apos;s clerk had the policy given up to him to get 
the stamp allowed, as was alleged on behalf of the com- 
pany ; but he took no steps for that purpose, and retained 
the policy until the 2nd September, 1860, when the loss 
was known. On that day the broker applied at the office 
that the risk might be considered as *^ on ;&quot; the cancella- 
tion having (as he said) been owing to ftn error in con- 
founding it with the prior policy for 2,000/. The secretary 
assented (as he said), provided the ship was safe, and the 
policy was left with him ; but shortly afterwards, on the 
same day, the company received a slip from Lloyd&apos;s, 
stating that the ship was lost. The company then refused 
to give up the policy, alleging that it had never really 
been delivered or issued at all. The plaintiff, on applying 
for it, declared that his broker had been settled with for 
the premium.

738 CASES AT THE

^^^^^ mentioned. 
WicKiiAM. f ijg ^j^gQ fQ,. ^jjg plaintiff was, that the policy had been 
duly ex&amp;iutedj and that the cancellation was a mere error. 

The case for the defendants was, that the policy had 
never been issued ; or if it had, that it had been cancelled, 
and the alleged mistake never set up until after the assured 
knew of the loss. 

The plaintiff&apos;s broker was called, and stated that the 
company&apos;s usage was to give the broker of the assured 
credit for the premiums. On the 1st May, the date of the 
policy, he received from the plaintiff an acceptance for 
premiums due on the insurances for 4,000Z. effected on the 
ship (cancelled), and a small sum for other insurances (the 
latter not including the one in question) ; and it was sug- 
gested that this bill covered the amount due for the present 
insurance, and really amounted to payment by the plaintiff 
to him. He denied any authority to disclaim or cancel the 
policy now in question. He admitted that the premium 
was due on the 8th June, and did not say he had ever 
settled for it with the company. 

It appeared that on the 2nd September a telegram was 
received at Lloyd^s at 8-20 a,m., to the effect that the ship 
was lost. 

The plaintiff admitted receiving a similar telegram on 
the evening of that day ; but, 

On the part of the plaintiff, it was insisted that the in- 
ference was, that he had received it at his office about the 
sakne time as Lloyd&apos;s. 

On the morning of the same day, after the receipt of the 
telegram at Lloyd&apos;s, the plaintiff&apos;s broker called at the office 
of the defendants and desired to renew the policy, and was 
told that he could do so if the ship was safe ; but time was 
taken to consider. 

There was some contradiction in the evidence as to this 



SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 



739 



interview ; but if the company agreed to renew the policy, 
there was to be a memorandum added to the memorandum 
of cancellation, &apos;^ cancelled in error.&apos;* 

Before, however, anything was done to show that the 
policy was renewed, the defendants heard of the loss, and 
it never was renewed. 

On the part of the defendants it was contended, that the 
policy never was entered into, because never accepted (a), 
and that it had also been duly cancelled. 

It did not appear whether the clerk of the defendants, to 

whom the policy was originally handed out after being 

^signed and sealed, was authorized to deliver it to the 

&apos; broker; but it appeared that the accountant who agreed 

to cancel had not such authority. 

There was evidence on the part of the defendants that 
it frequently happened that policies were cancelled, and 
that they were always cancelled in this way ; not by can- 
celling the slip, but the policy. 

Erlb, C. J., proposed to leave to the jury whether 
they believed the evidence for the defendants ; if so, there 
was sufficient evidence to support the plea of cancellation, 
and he should direct a verdict for the defendants, with 
leave to move; and liberty to the defendants to sustain 
the verdict on either ground.

CARALl V. XENOS. 

XHIS was an action by merchant against shipowner 
upon bill of lading. 

The declaration stated that one A. B. shipped on board 
the defendant&apos;s ship (bound for London) 117 &apos;&apos;skeleton 
packages&apos;* of fruit from Smyrna, to be delivered at St. 
Petersburgh (freight at 71. iO«. per ton, payable there, at

Lush and Hannen for the plaintiff. 

Montague Smith and Honyman for the defendant. 

On the Nth of October, 1860, the ship arrived at 
London, and on the 15th began to discharge. The defend- 
ant had given directions to discharge as soon as possible, 
being anxious to have the ship free. There were, how- 
ever, no particular directions as to the plaintiff&apos;s packages, 
which being &quot;skeleton &quot; (i e. large crates, each containing 
a great many packages), were much larger than others. 

There were in all about 80,000 packages in the ship, 
with about 400 diflerent marks. 

The plaintiff&apos;s packages were in the /ou?^ hold, scattered 
among those of all the other marks. 

On the 18th of October there was a steamer to St. 
Petersburgh, via Hull. 

On the 19th of October the discharge was completed. 

The packages were then sorted, first in the alphabetical 
order of the initial letters of the marks, and then by being 
resorted according to the marks of the different merchants, 
according to the manifest and the entry. 

Most uf the goods were for London, and some of the 
merchants sent their lighters for such of their&apos; goods as 
were not to be transhipped for export, in order to receive 




742 CASES AT THE 

1862. them more qnickly, it not being necessary in such cases 
to wait until the sorting was completed. 

But no goods could be transhipped until the sorting was 
completed, because the merchant could not make his 
entries until he had from the dock company the total 
weights of his consignments. 

On the 22nd of October, on the 27th of October, and 
on the 30th of October, there were steamers to Cronstadt, 
a port about eighteen miles from St Petersburgh, and the 
usual port of discharge for large vessels bound to that 
city ; but it appeared that in these vessels the &quot; ice clause,&apos;&apos; 
as it was called, was required to be inserted in the bills of 
lading, a clause which ran thus : &apos;^ That in the event of 
the navigation being impeded by ice, the goods may be 
landed at Revel, Riga, or any other port to which the 
vessel can get, and be forwarded by land at the shipper&apos;s 
expense and risk.&quot; And it was suggested, on the part of 
the defendant, that it was not for the interest of the mer- 
chant that the transhipment should be subject to this 
condition. 

There were other steamers which called at Hull, and 
did not go direct to St. Petersburgh, 

The sorting was not completed before the end of 
October, and before that time no goods were transhipped. 

After that time there were no vessels to St Petersburgh. 

It would have been quite practicable, however, to have 
selected and put by the plaintiff&apos;s packages, as they were 
discharged, for the purpose of transhipment, though this 
would have impeded the discharge for some days, which 
it was the shipowner&apos;s interest to get over as quickly as 
possible. To the dock company it did not matter whether 
they put on more men to the work and got the sorting 
done by four men in two days, or eight men in one day. 
And they would have expedited the business if pressed to 
do so. But no particular directions were given by the 
defendant to sdect and put by the plaintiff&apos;s packages. 




SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 743 

and the plaintiff swore (and this was not denied by the 1862. 
defendant) that on the 27th of October the plaintiff told 
him that his goods had been shipped on to St. Peters- 
burgh. 

There was evidence that between the 19th of October 
and the 30th of October the defendant could have sent on 
the plaintiff&apos;s goods by several ships, but that he objected 
to pay the freight demanded, viz. 40«. per ton. 

The season had passed ; hence the plaintiff&apos;s goods, 
which, being fruit, were of a perishable nature, did not 
get to St. Petersburgh, and were practically lost to him. 

On the 6th of November, 1860, the present action 
was commenced. 

. Jf . Smith, for the defendant, contended that there was 
no negligence or default before that time; that the 
usual course of business had been followed by the dock 
company in discharging and sorting the cargo ; that the 
shipowner was not bound to use extraordinary exertions, 
or take unusual measures; and that there were good 
reasons for not sending on the goods by the only steamers 
which could have been had before the action commenced. 

For the plaintiff it was contended, that the defendant 
had hurried the discharge of the cargo to get his ship the 
sooner ready for another voyage ; had taken no means to 
quicken the sorting of goods for transhipment; and that 
he had neglected to send on the goods merely to save 
something in the freight. 

The plaintiff would have sent his own lighters for his 
goods had they been set aside for transhipment, as they 
might have been. 

On the other hand, it was suggested, on the part of the 
defendant, that the sorting was partly delayed by the 
search for a missing package not sent. 

There was no evidence of any other delay in the sorting 
beyond the usual time for discharging such a number of 



744 



CASES AT THE

packages, and it appeared that the ordinary course of 
business had been pursued. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The action is on the clause 
in the bill of lading, &apos;^the goods to be forwarded by 
steamer direct from London (to St. Petersburgh) at the 
shipowner&apos;s expense.&apos;&apos; And the question turns on the 
plea, that the defendant used due care and diligence to 
forward the goods, according to the terms of the bill of 
lading. Did he do so? According to the plaintiflTs 
evidence, he did not do so. If, for instance, he delayed 
the transhipment in order to save money he had to pay 
for freight, that would not be using due diligence, for he 
had no right to delay the goods for that reason. Again, 
the plaintiff might have even sent his lighters for the 
goods, had they been set aside, as they might have been, 
for transhipment. If, however, the delay was caused by 
the search for the missing package, and the defendant 
otherwise used due diligence, he would be entitled to the 
verdict. It is for you to say whether the defendant did 
use due diligence, seeing that he seems to have taken no 
steps to procure ships before the season closed, and gave 
no particular directions to the dock company to hasten 
tlie sorting of the plaintiff&apos;s goods. 

Verdict for the plaintiff.

A trader hav- X HIS was an action (of trover and for money had and 

over wine war- received) by the assignees in bankruptcy of one Green- 
rants to the de- 
fendant, a 

creditor, on the occasion of a sudden stoppage of payment, caused by the unexpected with- 
drawal of assistance ; the transfer being preued tor by the creditor in a hostile spirit, and 
concurrently with other steps taken for his own protection, and the trader assenting to it 
with reluctance and struggling against bankruptcy several weeks afterwards in the hope of 
surmounting his difficulties : — Hetd^ that it was for the jury whether there was not a transfer 
of the property in the warrants for the benefit of the creditor, under pressure from him and

On the 9th of April, the bankrupt being indebted to 
Bedell and Heading, and also to one Lamb, had certain 
wine warrants deposited with the Bank of London as 
security for a loan account, on which he stood indebted to 
the amount of 1,360/., and had a cash balance of about 
600/., against which he had drawn a cheque for 460/. ; 
so that when the cheque was presented he would only 
have had a cash balance of about 40/. On that day, the 
9th of April, he had tried to get Bedell and Lamb, who 
was an auditor of the bank, to induce the bank to assist 
him, by letting the wine warrants stand as a security for 
the loan account, and making some further advance. On 
the 10th the parties met at the bank (where one or more 
bills of the bankrupt&apos;s had been dishonoured the same 
morning), and in the interval it appeared that Bedell had 
acquired through Lamb some information as to the con* 
dition of the bankrupt&apos;s cash account, and had also dis- 
covered that the bankrupt had dealt with a certain bill 
with what Bedell deemed a breach of faith. Thereupon* 
Bedell, having first seen the bank manager alone, they 
came out to him, and the manager told him he could do 
nothing for him, that he had, in fact, stopped payment, 
and that he must wind up. The bank had carried the 
cash balance of 600/. to the credit of the loan account, 
and so left the bankrupt without a farthing to meet the 
cheque or the bills which were thus dishonoured. The 
defendant Bedell then said to the bankrupt, &quot; You had 
better give the wine warrants to me ; they are as well in 
my hands as in any one else&apos;s;&quot; and then brought pen 
and ink, and dictated to him an order, addressed to the

bank^ to this effect, ** Deliver to bearer ibe wine wammts 
you hold, as payment of the debt for which yoQ have a 
lien thereon.&quot; This the batikrupt wrote and signed, and 
the defendant Bedell paid the bank the 950/. remaining 
due to them, and received the wine warrants. He had 
afterwards sold the wine for about IfiOOL, from which 
deducting the 950/., the sum he had paid the bank, there 
remained 695/., the sum for which titiis action was brought, 
but which he claimed to retain for his own debt, far greater 
in amount. The defendants, just after the interview of 
the 10th, wrote to the bankrupt an angry letter, threaten- 
ing that unless he gave security for the debt due from him, 
they should at once commence proceedings against him. 
On the 25th of May Greenwood filed his declaration of 
insolvency, and on the same day he was adjudicated a 
bankrupt. 

The case for the plaintiffs was not that there had been 
a transfer of the wine warrants by way of fraudulent pre- 
ference,, but that there had been no transfer of them to the 
defendants, and only a depont of them, not for the benefit 
of the defendants, but merely as a ** pledge &quot; (as the bank- 
rupt phrased it) that he should wind up. 

The case for the defendants was, that there had been a 
transfer of the wine warrants to them, and a transfer under 
pressure, so that, although voluntary, it was not a fraudu- 
lent preference (a). 



(a) Id order to render a prefer- 
ence on the eve of bankruptcy 
valid, it is not necessary that there 
should be a threat or pressure ; with 
the immediate power of rendering 
it available, by taking legal steps 
to defeat the transfer, it must be 
shown to have been voluntary and 
in contemplation of bankruptcy, 
and if it is in consequence of pres- 
sure by the creditor, it is not volun&apos;

certainly the trader did not con-

the contrary, was indignant at the 
idea of it, and struggled against it, 
so that he did not succumb until 
six weeks af^rwards, and the trans- 
fer was not voluntary, for he was 
most reluctant to submit loit.

According to the testimoDy of the bankrupt, who was 
called for the assignees, botli he and the defendant Bedell 
were most excited and indignant at their interview of the 
10th of April, the defendant being angry at what he 
deemed the bankrupt&apos;s breach of faith, the bankrupt at 
what he deemed the defendant&apos;s breach of promise ; and 
although the defendant and bankrupt differed a little as to 
their accounts of what passed, it appeared that the bank- 
rupt was most reluctant that the warrants should pass 
into the hands of the defendant, and that the attitude 
assumed by the defendant on that occasion was most 
adverse. This was further shown by the letter written 
just after, and also by the fact that, on the same day, the 
defendants placed an attachment on certain funds of the 
trader, who it was evident did not intend bankruptcy, and 
still struggled to the last against it, nor yielded to it until 
several weeks afterwards. And it was obvious, on the 
other hand, that Bedell, the defendant, was pursuing to the 
utmost his own interests, and intended to take a transfer 
for his own benefit. 

In the course of proving the case for the defendants, 
Erlb, C. J., pointed out that in. urging the intention to 
take a benefit for themselves, they must take care not to 
fall into the mischief of a fraudulent preference. 

Lloyd, in summing up for the defendants, urged that 
the transaction was obviously adverse and under pressure, 
and that the creditor, having better information than the 
others, had a right to use pressure to obtain a preference. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — The question is, whether 
the defendants have proved to your satisfaction that the 
property in these warrants was transferred to them by the 
trader on the pressure referred to. The case for the plain- 
tiffs is, that they were deposited with them merely to hold 
for the body of the creditors. The case for the defendants 
is; that they were transferred to thein for their own benefit.

It IS clear they were pursuing their own interest, and 
desired to get the warrants for their own benefit. It is 
plain that Bedell complained bitterly of the trader for a 
supposed breach of fiEiith, and was acting adversely ; and 
it is for you to say whether, knowing what the defendants 
did of the circumstances of the trader, and that bank- 
ruptcy was impending, it would have been any object with 
them to hold these warrants for the general body of tbe 
creditors. Unless the transfer was for their own benefit, 
the question of fraudulent preference would not arise; and 
as the plaintiffs deny the trtuufer^ they did not rely on 
that doctrine ; but it is for the defendants Xjq make out if 
there wcu a transfer for their benefit, that it was not 
fraudulent. If the warrants were obtained by the defend- 
ants by pressure, and the trader handed them over against 
his own will, to transfer the property to the defendants, 
find for them. If otherwise, find for the plaintiffs.

Horace Lloyd for the defendants. 

Before the transaction in question, the defendant Price 
had been concerned in shipping for the plaintiffs a quantity 
of wine, made up of various other wines, not including 
Madeira, but shipped by the plaintiffs to Demerara as 
Madeira wine. 

On the 3rd January, 1860, the plaintiffs had desired 
that a similar consignment should be made up and shipped 
by the defendants, and the invoice, dated on that day, was 
headed as follows : — &quot; Invoice of 14 pipes of Madeira, 
shipped per Harbinger^ for Demerara, by Smith and Lax- 
ton of London, for their account and risk, to be sold if 
possible at Demerara, or to be reshipped in another vessel 
for Liverpool or Bristol, consigned by Price k Co. for ac- 
count of Smith k Co.&quot; The total amount of the invoice price 
was 665/. The bills of lading were made out in the names 
of the defendants. The plaintiffs desired the defendants 
to effect an insurance on this shipment, and they professed 



750 CASES AT THE 

1862. to do BO ; and on the 8th January, debited the plaintiA 
^^^^&apos;^ with the premium in their books. They made the ship- 



and Another ment, however, without effecting any insurance, and the 
Price&amp;hip Struck on a rock at Weymouth before the end of the 
and Another. n,onth. On hearing of it, the plaintiff Smith saw the de- 
fendant Price, and asked if the consignment was insured ; 
to which the defendant replied evasively, that he had a 
general insurance on the ship : in truth some brandies of 
the defendants and the wines of the plaintiffs were the 
only goods on board which were not insured. 

The ship was got off with some amount of damage to 
the cargo, for which there was a general average. 

On the 6th February the ship was brought round to the 
West India Docks, but most of the pipes of plaintiffs&apos; 
wine were on shore at Weymouth. 

On the llth February, the plaintiff Smith, not having 
seen the wine, had an interview with the defendant Price, of 
which they gaye rather different versions. The plaintiff&apos;s 
account was, —&lt;^ He asked me what the wine cost, and what 
I would take. He offered 400/.; we at last agreed for 
600/. ; he gave me 200/., and I gave a re&lt;5eipt, which ran 
thus: — * llth Feb., 1861. Received of Messrs. Price&amp;Co. 600/. in full, for our claim on the loss of 14 pipes of 
Madeira per the Harbinger, as per invoice of the 3rd 
January, 1861.&apos;&quot; There was added this memorandum : — 
&quot; Received 200/. to-day, 1 1th Feb., the balance to be paid 
on Saturday next.&quot; The version which the defendant 
Price gave was, that the plaintiff assured him that the 
wine was worth the invoice price, and that it was so 
damaged as that there was a total loss. The plaintiff de- 
nied this, though he admitted be stated his belief thai the 
wine was damaged, and also that he should be a loser by 
the bargain, and that the wine cost him more than 460/. 
and would fetch more than he was to be paid. 

At this time there were negotiations going on, unknown 
to the plaintiffs, between the defendant Price and the agent 



SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 761 

of Lloyd&apos;s, as regarded the value of the saWage, and the 1862. 

amount of general average was being estimated. The ^&apos;^&apos;&quot;&apos;^ 

average statement was made up, on information furnished and Another 

by the defendants (they appearing as owners on the bill ykke

only 650Ly and the defendants&apos; brandies at only 2s. 6d. a 

gallon, so as to make a far higher average on the plaintiffs&apos; 

wines than on the defendants&apos; brandies. And about the 

same time the defendants agreed with Lloyd&apos;s agents to take 

the wines at 12/, a pipe, whereas their own estimate of 

their value was now 25L per pipe, and the sum of 600/. 

which they had agreed to pay» was at the rate of 35/. per 

pipe. It appeared that, according to the usage of Lloyd&apos;s, 

the whole of such a consignment would be regarded as 

salvage, if, as was admitted to be the case, one pipe was 

utterly spoilt, and others partly damaged. At this time 

Lloyd&apos;s report had not been received, but it was suggested 

that the defendants being in communication with Lloyd&apos;s 

agent knew what it would be, and that, for the reasons 

they mentioned, they desired to be off their bargain with 

the plaintiffs, and to prevent the wines from being included 

in the sale of salvage. 

On the 13th February, two days after their agreement, 
the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs this letter : — &quot; We 
have received the report of Lloyd&apos;s surveyor, your wines 
are free from damage, and cannot therefore be included in 
the salvage sale of damaged goods ; the portion of goods 
saved being returned to the owners, the underwriters pay- 
ing all average. This will prevent an intended arrange- 
ment&quot; 

The report of Lloyd&apos;s surveyor was dated the 18th 
February (several days after the above letter), and it did 
not describe the wines as free from damage. On the 
contrary, it was admitted that one pipe was wholly spoilt 
and several others partially so, by reason of salt water ; 
the evidence being contradictory as to the precise extent 



752 



CASES AT THE

of the damage, and all the witnesses more or less differing 
as to the exact number of casks into which the salt water 
bad so far entered as to spoil the wine, the matter being 
one of taste and opinion rather than of definite positive 
fact. 

On the 18th February the defendants wrote, that the 
samples of the wines had been examined, that they were 
not of the invoiced value, and were not Mcukira wines at 
all. The defendants refused all further payment except as 
to the one pipe totally spoilt, in respect of which they had 
paid into Court 40/. 

The plaintiff Smith swore, and it was not denied, that 
the wines actually cast him 4602. and were worth to him 
at least 500/. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — ^The question on which your 
verdict must turn is this, whether the bargain between the 
parties was obtained by the fraud of the plaintiffs ? If iio^, 
then find your verdict for the plaintiffs for 300/. If it was 
obtained by their fraud, then, as the defendants not having 
obeyed their duty to effect an insurance, are liable to the 
same extent as underwriters would have been, find for the 
defendants, if you consider the sum of 40/. sufficient to 
satisfy the damage sustained by the goods : for the plain- 
tiffs if you consider it is not sufficient. With regard to the 
question of fraud, if the plaintiff Smith asserted, as of his own 
knowledge^ any matter of fact which has turned out to be 
false, and by means of such assertion obtained the contract, 
then that would be a fraud on his part, which would vitiate 
the contract. For if a man for his own object and his own 
benefit asserts a, fact as known to himself to exist, which 
does not exist, he is guilty of fraud, whether or not he 
hnows it does not exist, because he asserts it as of his own 
knowledge when he does not know whether it exists or 
not. This principle does not, it is obvious, apply to 
matters of mere opinion, but only to assertions of matters 
otfactf on which it may be supposed that the other party 



SITTINGS— COMMON PLEAS. 753 

lias relied. Now I cannot find that the plaintiff Smith 1862. 
made any statement of any definite matter of fact on which ^^&apos;^^^ 
the defendant Price could reasonably be supposed to have and Another 
relied. For instance, this could hardly be supposed of the p^j^E 
plaintiff&apos;s mere assertion of his belief of the value of his *&quot;^ Another, 
wines. Nor of his alleged statement as to the extent of the 
damage ; for he had not any better means of knowledge on 
that matter than the defendants, nor perhaps so good. He 
had not seen the wines, nor did he pretend to have done so. 
Had he indeed asserted that he had seen them, and that 
they were damaged to such an extent, it would have been 
otherwise. He might well have believed that the wines were 
worth what he was to get for them, or even the amount of 
the invoice price (supposing that he said so, which he 
denies), for it might be that they would have sold for that 
amount As to the mixing of the wines the defendant 
knew all about it; was he really deceived by the plaintiff?

In February, 1860, the firm had fallen into great dif-

when they stopped payment showed the greatest distress 
from want of money to meet their engagements. 

On the 3rd of May, 1860, the firm had no funds to pro- 
vide for payment of a demand of 60/., and shortly afker^ 
wards they dishonoured a bill for 2302. 

The 18th of May and the 2nd of June were the dates of 
the invoices of the two parcels of goods now in question, 
but there were suspicious circumstances as to the entries 
and the deliveries. 

On the 18th of June the firm stopped payment, and on 
the 20th a proposal made at a meeting of creditors was 
rejected. 

On the 4th of July they were adjudicated bankrupts,

last entry in their stock-book, and they were insolvent ever

aflTecting the ^rm. 

Hammersley, the other bankrupt, was also called, and 
stated that the defendant was to have the goods, and he 
had ordered some of them to be put up. 

They stated that in May negotiations had been pending 
with one Edmondson to take him into the firm, with an 
accession of capital to the extent of 3,000/., and that these 
negotiations were not broken off until the end of June. 

The defendant was called, and swore that he had lent 
the money on the terms that he should be at liberty to 
take it out in goods if he could not be paid in money, and 
that he had repeatedly pressed and applied for the pay- 
ment as early as April, and was told the firm were short of 
money. 

But there was no evidence of pressure, beyond mere ap- 
plication by the defendant. 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — To find for the plaintiffs, the 
assignees, you must be satisfied that the transfers of these 
goods were in contemplation of bankruptcy, and also by 
way of fraudulent preference. 

There is hardly evidence that at the end of May, the 
time of these transfers, the firm contemplated bankruptcy. 

There was, no doubt, at the end of May or the beginning 
of May, great embarrassment, but perhaps not contempla- 
tion of bankruptcy. The decision to stop payment takes 
some days to grow up in the mind of a trader, and ripen 
into a resolved intention. 

On the 18th of June, beyond all doubt, the firm had 
bankruptcy in contemplation.

were in contemplation of bankruptcy and by way of fraudu- 
lent preference; and secondly, because there had been no 
wrongful conversion. 

Erle, C. J., overruled, but reserved, both points. 

The defendant was called and stated that in April, 1860, 
she had applied to her brother, the bankrupt, for payment, 
and he had referred her to the other bankrupt, to whom 
she said she had threatened that &apos;&apos; if she were not paid 
she should take proceedings.&quot; (But there were no appear- 
ances of pressure beyond mere applications.) 

She stated that her brother sent her the bills, for which 
she gave no receipt, and which were sent in an envelope 
without any written communication. 

There were various suspicious circumstances about the 
entries as to the dates of deliveries of the bills. 

After Edmondson&apos;s bill was delivered to her, her brother 
had told her that Edmondson would be prepared to pay 
her. 

Edmondson was called to support her case, by showing 
that in May, and down to the end of June, he was nego- 
tiating for a share in the firm, to which he was to bring 
3,000/., of which this bill for 600Z. was to be considered 
part ; but, on cross-examination, it turned out that he was

never in a position to bring capital into a concern ; and that 
in May and June be had received from the firm goods to the 
amount of 1,400/. (to sell for them on commission), which 
they had just before purchased, and not paid for, and out 
of the proceeds of which the bill was paid. 

Bovillf in reply, denounced the transactions with Ed- 
moudson as grossly fraudulent. 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — ^Were these bills transferred 
to the defendant in contemplation of bankruptcy, and out 
of a desire to favour and prefer her, and not by reason of 
any pressure on her part ? The nature of the transactions of 
the firm just before that which is in question, must hare a 
great bearing on both these questions. For if traders are 
not dealing in a fair mercantile way, they cannot hare any 
honest hope of continuing to carry on business, and so 
may be taken to have contemplated bankruptcy. Then, 
as to whether the transfers were voluntary? 

It is said there were applications which amounted to 
pressure. But it is not enough that there has been pres- 
sure. The very pressure may be pre-arranged. The ques- 
tion is, whether the transfers were really by reason of the 
pressure, or merely from a desire on the part of the trader 
to prefer the particular creditor ? 

Verdict for the plaintiffs.

In 1855, one S. died intestate, leaving a widow and HAnaifOK 
children, and administration was granted to the widow. •&apos;&apos;** Anpther. 

In 1857, C, the uncle of the children, instituted a suit, 
as next friend, on their behalf, to recover certain monies in 
which they were interested. In this suit the defendants 
were solicitors for the plaintiffs, and B., as their managing 
clerk, had the conduct of it. It appeared that he had his 
name on the door of a room at the defendants&apos; oflSces, and 
was the only one of their clerks who had this privilege. 

The suit was amicably ended by an agreement, under 
which a sum of money was paid to the plaintiffs, as trus- 
tees for the children. 

B. then proposed to the plaintiffs to invest it on mort- 
gage, and took them to see certain property, which he 
pretended was to be mortgaged to them. Ultimately the 
money was paid over to him by the plaintiffs, by their 
cheque, in his favour. 

The plaintiffs did not, throughout the transaction, inquire 
for or appeal to the defendants, nor ask for the deeds ; nor 
were any deeds executed. The transaction did not appear 
in the defendants&apos; books at all. And B., though he had 
authority to receive money for them when paid by clients, 
for costs, in the ordinary way of business, had no autho- 
rity to receive money by way of investment, nor did it 
appear that he had ever so received money in any instance 
before the present 

Shortly after he received the money he absconded ; and 
the defendants were then, for the first time, applied to, and 
then became first aware of the transaction. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury).— It requires a special autho- 
rity, beyond that of a mere managing clerk, to entitle 
him to receive money, so as to bind his employers, for 
the purpose of investment. It does not appear here, that

6. had any such authority. Did the derendanto hold him 
out as having such authority? It does not matter that the 
plaintiffs believed he had such authority. The question is, 
did the defendants hold him out, or allow him to hold him- 
self out, as having such authority ?

reason of the non-compliance with the warranty, the ship 
was prevented from proceeding with all possible despatch 
direct to CardiiF, according to the charter, and was com- 
pelled to put back in the course of her voyage to Cardiff, 
i.e. to Liverpool, and there to be made Hight and fit for 
the voyage,&apos; and did not arrive at Cardiff until a long and 
unreasonable time after she ought, and could, and would 
have arrived there, had the warranty been complied with.&quot; 

LusljL and Honyman for the plaintiffs. 

Bovill and W. Williams for the defendants. 

On the 13th October, 1860, the charter was entered into 
containing the clause pleaded, &quot; That the ship, being war&apos; 
ranted now tight, staunch and strong&quot; shall, with all pos- 
sible despatch, proceed to Cardiff, and there load,&amp;c. 

It was admitted that, at the time of the charter, it was 
necessary, in order to fit the ship for the chartered voyage, 
to execute certain repairs, which were done with all pos- 
sible despatch ; that, for the purpose of such repairs, it was 
necessary that the ship should go into dry dock. On or 
about the 19th October, the ship was accordingly put into 
dry dock at Liverpool for these repairs. 

On the 31st October a conversation took place between 
the plaintiff and one of the defendants, as to which they 
varied in their evidence; but of which the plaintiff&apos;s version 
was, that he mentioned that certain repairs were required, 
and that when they were completed accounts should be 
sent to the defendants (in order to inform the under- 
writers), and that the defendants assented to this course. 
And although the defendant gave a different version, it did 
not appear that it was at that time intimated that the de- 
fendants would refuse to load the vessel on the ground 
that the ship had not been able to sail direct to Cardiff. 

On the 14th November the ship left the dry dock, but 
was twice forced to put back into the Mersey by stress of 
weather.

On the 20th November it was known at Lloyd&apos;s that this 
was so. 

On the 23rd November the ship reached Cardiff, and 
was ready to load a cargo. 

On the same day the defendants wrote to the plaintifik, 
that in consequence of the non*performance of the charter, 
to proceed direct to Cardiff, and the breach of the other 
conditions and warranties in the charter, they declined to 
load a cargo. 

To this the plaintiffs replied, that &quot; they had not delayed 
the repairs which they had stated were required, and that 
the delay was owing to the weather.&quot; 

It was suggested, on the part of the plaintiffs, that the 
clause, ** the vessel being tight,&quot;&amp;c., was part of a printed 
form, to which attention had not been drawn, and which 
had been left in by mistake ; but there was no proof that 
both the parties had mistaken or overlooked the clause (a); 
and the plaintiffs&apos; main reliance was upon waiver by the 
defendants of the condition, which it was admitted had not 
been complied with. On the other hand, the defendants&apos; 
breach of the contract was not denied. 

Eblb, C. J. (to the jury). — As to the first point, it be- 
hoves you to be very cautious how you allow the words of 
a contract, which a paKy has signed, whether written or 
printed, to be got rid of by oral evidence, as to its not 
having been understood or adverted to at the time the con- 
tract was entered into. But the main point in the case is 
this — whether the defendants, knowing that the ship was 
not seaworthy at the time of the charter, nevertheless 
treated it as a valid contract ? T*here is evidence for you 
that they did so treat it. There is the evidence of the 
plaintiffs, which shows that the defendants knew that the 
ship was to enter a dock and be repaired for the voyage, 
and that the warranty, literally, could not be complied 



(o) Which would be neceasary to raise even an equity. 




SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 763 

with. Yet it does not appear that, when the parties met I862&lt;about the matter (whether or not the defendants auented 
to the repairs being done), the defendants declared that on 
account of the breach of the condition they did not intend 
to load the vessel. If you think that, after knowing the 
breach of the warranty, the defendants treated the charter 
as still subsisting, find for the plaintiffs. 

Verdict for the plaintiffs.

Coleridge, Q. C, and Pearce, for the defendants. 

In November, 1859, the plaintiffs, having in London 
chartered the ship referred to, put her up to load. On 
the 6th January, 1860, one of the defendants saw the 
plaintiffs, said he had some soap to ship for Calcutta, and 
asked the rate of freight. This was agreed upon, and the 
plaintiffs made the memorandum on the back of one of 
their cards. 

&apos;M5 tons boxes soap, 39s. per ton of 40 feet, payable 
here.— 3. L.&amp;S.&quot; 

The soap was accordingly shipped on board without any 
further communication between the plaintiffs and the de- 
fendants. It was in fact shipped by Gray k Co., but of 
this the plaintiffs had thereof no knowledge; the defend- 
ants not having said anything as to their being agents or 
acting for any one else. And though they were brokers, 
the plaintiffs did not know it at the time. 

In the course of business bills of lading were sent to the 
offices of the plaintiffs made out in the name of Oray ^ 
Co., stating, &apos;&apos; freight to be paid in London, ship lost or 
not lost.&quot; These bills of lading got into the hands of 
Gray&amp;Co., but not with the plaintiffs&apos; knowledge. 

The ship having sailed on the 10th January, the plain- 
tiffs then sent to the defendants account of freight made 
out to them. 

The ship was soon afterwards lost. 

The plaintiffs applied first to the defendants for pay- 
ment and then to Gray k Co., who referred them to the 
defendants, stating that they had paid the money to theoL 
The plaintiffs then again applied to the defendants, who 



SITTINGS-COMMON PLEAS. 765 

did not pay, but according to the plaintifTs&apos; evidence pro- 1862. 
mised to do so, and the plaintiffs then (2lBt August, 1860) ^^^^ 
wrote to Gray k Co. in these terms :— &apos;&apos; We have applied and Another 
without effect to Perrin&amp;Co., your agents^ for your freight, Perrin 
and have now to give you notice, that unless it is paid &quot;^ Another, 
we shall apply to the County Court for our remedy, we 
think you should see we get our due,&amp;c.&quot; To this there 
was no answer. But in a day or two one of the defend- 
ants called and tendered the sum due for freight, disputing 
the primage. The tender was refused, and a plaint levied 
in the Sheriffs&apos; Court against the defendants, on the trial of 
which Gray being called, stated, *&apos; He had not employed 
defendant as an agent. He called on me and said he 
heard I had some soap for Calcutta, and he could take it 
cheaper than I could do it elsewhere. I told him I had 
soap to ship. He told me the rate of freight by the ship 
in question. I agreed to ship the goods. I saw theplain^ 
tiffs after the goods were on board, and asked for bilk of 
lading in the name of Gray ^ Co. : a day or two after- 
wards I obtained them, made out in the name of Qray ^ 
Co. I had paid the defendants money on a gejieral ac- 
count (having had many transactions with them) both 
prior to and after the 5th January. There is a balance 
now due to them. I never gave them special directions to 
appropriate any money in payment of this freight.&quot; [It 
appeared that Gray k Co. had since stopped payment, 
and hence it was important for the plaintiffs to fix the 
defendants.&quot;] 

On this evidence, the Judge of the Sheriffs&apos; Court 
directed a nonsuit, which the Court of Common Pleas in 
Michaelmas Term, 1861, set aside; being. of opinion that 
there was evidence to go to a jury of a contract by the 
shippers, the defendants, to pay the freight. The cause 
was then removed by certiorari by an order of Willbs, J., 
and now came on for trial.

The plaintiffs, ship-brokers, were called, and stated, that 
they had told the defendant they had orders to charter 
some ships, and proposed to charter one of his ships, the 
Indus. He had Jive ships, and proposed that they should 
charter all of them. One of the plaintiffs then (on the 12th 
October) went to Spicer to see if this could be arranged. 
There, one Bolton, the broker of one Lee, was introduced 
to the defendant by Spicer, and Lee also was present, and 
arranged to charter three of the other ships. As Lee&apos;s 
partner, however, would not accept, these charters were 
not carried out The defendant, on the day when they 
were entered into, asked what was to be done as to the 
Indus (the ship in question) as he intended to charter it ? 
The plaintiff said, that whatever was done in respect of 
the Indus he should expect his commission. The def^^nd* 
ant replied, that he did not recognize him in the transaction.

The plaintiff beard nothing more of the transaction until a 1862. 
few days after, when he heard that the Indus had been ^^^^^ 

* GlBtOM 

chartered to one De Mattos, and that Spicer and Bolton and Another 
were to share the commission. The charter was from New- ceick. 
port to Bordeaux. Bolton was called, and it appeared that 
it was Lee who had mentioned the ships to De Mattos,and 
thus led him to determine to charter the Indus. Lee had 
an interest in promoting the trade in coal from Newport, 
and agreed to advance money on the adventure. Having 
got De Mattos to agree to it, Lee went to Bolton and told 
him, if he could get the defendant to agree to the charter, 
he should be paid his commission; and then, in the usual 
way, Bolton and Spicer, as agent Of the defendant, the 
shipowner, agreed to divide the commission. The plaintiff 
and De Mattos were never in communication, nor did the 
plaintiff ever meet or know Bolton as the agent or 
broker of the charterer, De Mattos, nor was the plaintiff 
at all aware of what was going on, nor had he any know- 
ledge of the negotiation for the charter between Bolton 
on behalf of De Mattos, and Spicer on behalf of the ship- 
owner, the defendant. 

No custom or usage was proved or proffered in evidence 
as to a right to commission under such circumstances; 
but,

question, — ** What is the custom with regard to payment

770 CASES AT THE 

1862. monthfiy and a receipt for 3/. for interest from 19th March 
to 19th May, 1861, was produced. 

On the 30th April, 1861, the defendant, with several 
other persons, went to the plaintiff&apos;s house, and shortly 
before two o&apos;clock served him with a written notice to pay 
the money by two o&apos;clock on that day. The plaintiff re&gt;monstrated, and pressed for at least an hour or two to go 
and get the money, to which the defendant appeared to 
assent, and the plaintiff went away for the purpose, but in 
his absence the defendant seized his stock, ice. on the pra- 
mises and removed it. 

There was some attempt to prove an implied assent to 
this course in the event of the plaintiff not being able to 
get the money, and it appeared that he had not got it by 
the time the removal was completed, just as he returned. 

The goods were afterwards sold, and 2L 2#. paid to the 
plaintiff as the balance. 

The value of the goods was shown to be 200/., and there 
was evidence that they were sold carelessly and under the 
proper value. 

There was evidence also that the defendant&apos;s men be- 
haved with violence and rudeness in the plaintiff&apos;s dwelling- 
house and premises, and towards his wife and the other 
inmates (a). 

It appeared, also, that the removal of the stock,&amp;c. put 
an end to the plaintiff&apos;s business as a farmer, and that the 
taking away his furniture deprived him of his dwelling (i).

That the question of reasonable 
notice is for the jury, whether it 
means a reasonable time to do the 
particular act, or what is reason- 
able under all the circumstances, 
vide Goodwyn v. Cheveiey, 28 L. J., 
Exch. 298. The Court appeared 
to be strongly of opinion that some 
reasonable notice was required, and 
that the rule to be laid down as to 
what was reasonable would proba- 
bly be, the time necessary to en- 
able the plaintiff to get the money; 
and supposing him to be able to do 
so, either by recourse to his bankers, 
or by borrowing it from a neigh- 
bour, it not being reasonable to ex- 
pect that he would keep the money 
about his person, or even locked up 
in his house; and the natural 
meaning of the word &quot; notice,&quot; es- 
pecially coupled with the words 
•*Uft at the place of abode,&quot;&amp;&amp;, 
was, that was to be something be- 
yond a mere demand, and to pre- 
cede^ by some reasonable time, the 
actual seizure of the goods, and 
what would be reasonable was for 
the jury. But as they thought that 
the debt should be deducted from 
the damages, they suggested that 
the defendant should be content 

3f 



with a reduction of the damages to 
that amount, to which both parties 
acceded. This point, however, was 
not argued ; and though in Ciliard 
V. Batet, 8 M.&amp;W. 575, it was 
held, that in an action for a debt 
for goods sold, the defendant could 
not plead a re-taking of the goods 
by the plaintiflT, that was a mere 
plea of the tort ; and in Jonei v. 
Sttwkim, 5 C. B. 142, it was held, 
that it was a good answer in debt, 
that the plaintiff had taken goods 
wrongfully, and retained them in 
tatisjitction. It should seem, there- 
fore, that in this case the plaintiff 
was entitled to retain the full da- 
mages, the defendant being a 
wrongdoer (vide Keen v. Priest, 28 
L. J., Exch. 157; ted vide Chu- 
nery v. Vialt, 29 L. J., Exch. 180, 
which, however, was only trover, 
and the price was due), even apart

damages, as to which, vide Vol. I ,

(6) Still it would be for the jury, 
because the circumstances of vio- 
lence,&amp;c. not amounting to any m^ 
stantive trespass (such as the break- 
ing of outer doors,&amp;c.), would be 
mere matter of aggravation, as- 
suming any right to enter and 
seize, although it is otherwise of a 
personal assault, which ex vi ttr»

cludes licence or assent. Chritto*

Steele

Low 
and Another. 



The plaintiff stated that rrom 1848 to 1866 serial 
actions had been defended by him on the orders of Young, 
and several bills of costs sent in and paid by cheques 
iigned by the defendants ; but it was admitted that they 
had been signed in blank, and filled up and delivered by 
Young, Nor did the plaintiff say that he had received 
orders or directions from the defendants as to these costs 
or suits. 

The bill of costs now claimed commenced in 1856 and 
closed in 1867. It was then sent in \not headed to amy 
one&quot;] to the defendants. During the course of the suit the 
plaintiff received no order or direction about it from tbe 
defendants, nor were they, in fact, aware of it until the 
trial. After the bill was sent in, the plaintiff received from 
Young a cheque for 100/., signed by the defendants in 
blank, and filled up by Young; and subsequently he re- 
ceived 350Z. from them out of the assets of the estate. At 
a meeting on the subject, in which they agreed that be 
should have this sum out of the estate, they protested 
against any personal liability, i. e. against any liability 
except out of the funds of the estate in their hands. And 
it was not opened for the plaintiff that they had any funds 
in their hands out of the estate ; and it was stated on their 
part, and not denied, that they had, in fact, none; tbe 
paper barely paying its expenses. Several letters were put 
in, in which the defendants spoke of costs as to come out 
of the estate. 

On this evidence, which formed the whole case for the 
plaintiff, 

Martin, B., expressed his doubt if there was any case 
for the jury, but was strongly of opinion that there was no 
personal liability in the defendants. The deed certainly 
did not contain anything which imported a personal liabi- 
lity, though he could not say that there was not any evi- 
dence for the jury; in the rest of the evidence, it did not, 
in his view, carry the case any further. The deed merely 



SITTINGS-EXCHEQUER. 776 

empowered the defeadanU to pay out of the funds derived 1863. 
from the estate, and there was nothing io any letter or ^ 
other communication of theirs to the plaintiff which im* «. 

plied any contract for a pers&amp;nal liability ; i. e. a liability ^nd Aaother. 
at all events, and out of their own pockets. He, however, 
left the whole case to the jury, asking them whether they 
thought there was any such understanding between the 
parties ?

was not, and were about to find a verdict for the de-

It appeared that the defendants and the plaintiff had 
bought some cattle together, the plaintiff having nine and 
the defendants two ; that the plaintiff had engaged a truck 
for his cattle, the truck only being large enough to hold 
his, and that the defendants had put in their two oxen. 
The result of which, on the plaintiff&apos;s evidence, was, so to 
crowd the plaintiff&apos;s cattle that they were found, at the 
end of the journey, very much injured and deteriorated in 
value. 

At the close of the case for the plaintiff, on the first two 
counts, no evidence having been given on the third, 



SITTINGS— EXCHEQUER, 777 

Overend Bubmitted that there was no cause of action. ^^^2- 

Martin^ B., held that there was a case for the jury (a). Raymoe 

Overend then applied, on the part of the defendant Pru- ^^ Another, 
dence, for leave to add a plea of the defence founded on 
the award ; but 

MAKTiNy B., refused the leave (unless on condition of 
paying all the costs), the case having been on the paper a 
week, and thus a great expense caused to the plaintiff in 
keeping his witnesses in town, so that the application was 
much too latel 

The defendants&apos; case was then gone into. 

The submission to arbitration was conditioned for the 
making of an award on or before the 3 1st October; and a 
document bearing that date, and purporting to be an award 
for 8/., was put in, and proved by the arbitrator. 

The cross-examination went, however, to show that the 
arbitration had not been really completed, nor the award 
delivered, on that day; and the stamp on the award, a 
28. 6d. stamp (b), was dated the 27th February. 

Martin, B., pointed this out; suggesting whether a 
stamp could be affixed (without a fine) more than six 
weeks after the making of the instrument (c). 

[The award being dated the Slst October, the action 
was commenced on the 6th December, and the pleas were 
pleaded on the 6th January ; the stamp bearing date the 
27th February.]

4, That there was an alteration in the risk near to the *• 

premises insured, so as to increase the nsk, viz., by stowing 
rice-chaff in or near to the premises insured. 

Sir William Atherton, A.-G., and Udall for the plaintiff. 

Hawhim and Keane for the defendant. 

The policy was effected in 1867. For some years pre- 
viously part of the premises had been used as a mill&apos; for 
the grinding, not only of corn but of the &quot;offal&quot; of corn, 
i.e. the pollard or finer part of the husk, and also of rice- 
chaff, the husk of rice. In that year, however, and after 
the policy, the other part of the premises, previously used 
as a chocolate mill, was applied to the grinding of rice- 
chaff. The business had been always carried on openly 
and publicly, and it appeared to have been always known 
in the neighbourhood that rice-chaff was ground at the 
mill. One Barker, the agent for the company at the place 
where the mill was, went to look at the premises when the 
proposal was made, he made no particular inquiries, but 
appeared to know what the mill was. No questions were 
asked as to rice-chaff or what was ground at the mill, 
and no statement on that point was made by the assured. 
The proposal was simply to insure the stock in trade at the 
plaintiff&apos;s water corn-mill. 

Hawkins contended that this was not a true description 
of a mill at which the offal of corn was ground, at all events, 
where rice-^haff was ground. And he called scientific 
witnesses to prove that rice-chaff was far more inflammable 
than pollard, and also officers of insurance companies to 
prove that the risk was on that account deemed greater 
and the premium required higher. But these witnesses 
only spoke from hearsay or vague impression, and the 
scientific witnesses only from analysis of the substance of 
rice-chaff as compared with flour, not with pollard. There 




780 CASES AT THE 

1862. was DO practical witness on behalf of the defendants to 
prove that the grinding of rice-&apos;chaff was more perilous 
than the grinding of pollard^ nor that a mill for the grind- 
ing of pollard as well as corn might not be fully and truly 
described as a corn-mill. On the other hand, various 
practical witnesses on the part of the plaintiff proved that 
a corn-mill was properly for the grinding both of the corn 
and the husk, and that the grinding of the pollard or corn 
husk was not more dangerous than that of rice-chaff. 

MartiNi B., thought that the only plea which the de- 
fendants could possibly rely upon was the third. 

Hawkins, as to that, contended that as it was not pre- 
tended that the plaintiff, the assured, had stated that rice- 
chaff was to be ground, there had been an omission to 
communicate ** a matter material to be made known to the 
company;&quot; but 

Martin, B., told the jury that this condition cleariy 
meant something was material to be known to the com- 
pany and which was not known to them or their officers. 
Here, however, the matter was known to them. The mill 
had been used for years for the grinding of rice-chaff, and 
used publicly and openly, and the company&apos;s officer resident 
in the neighbourhood well knew the mill. Did the plain- 
tiff, then, &quot;omit to communicate the matter which he 
might well presume they knew V It all turns on that, for 
there is no pretence for imputing misrepresentation, as the 
defendant made no representation at all. Was the matter, 
however, material to be known ** to the company ?&quot; Unless 
it was material there could be no defence on any ground. 

Verdict for the plaintiff.

the produce of the seven acres could be distinguished, the 
deFendant, finding that (as he said) the seed was so &apos;&apos;com-

for the defendant was, that the tender was fraudulent. 
There was, on the part of the plaintiff, an attempt to set 
up a subsequent tender of the right quantity ; but 

Bramwell, B., told the jury that the sole question for 
them was, whether the first tender had been fraudulent ; 
for if so, then, as against the plaintiff, a reasonable time 
had then elapsed for him to make a tender, and a subse- 
quent tender would be too late; did the plaintiff then, 
wishing to force the defendant to take more than he had 
bargained for, unfairly tender the large quantity ? If so,

consequences &quot; 

fed^^Mi^&apos;&quot;^ The plaintiff was a farmer and grazier, who used to feed 
his cattle with oil cake, and had bought some from the de- 
fendant for that purpose before. The defendants were 
«eed-crusher8, and sold the refuse cake produced in the 
process of seed-crushing in its crude and natural state, 
just as it came from their mills, to farmers as oil cake, 
but without any description as cattle food, or any express 
or actual warranty as such, and without so far as appeared 
anything being said as to its use. The plaintiff had bought 
a quantity of this refuse oil cake, without saying that be 
wanted it for the feed of cattle, and without its being de- 
scribed as such. It did not even appear that the defend- 
ants knew that the plaintiff was going to use it as food for 
cattle, at all events, in its crude state, as he bought it from 
them. He did, however, so use it, and several of the 
cattle died. It was proved that they had died in conse- 
quence of the crude, harsh, nature of the cake, the particles 
of which, not being triturated or softened, acted injuriously 
on the coats of the animals&apos; stomachs, and so, not by 
chemical but mechanical action, caused their deaths. 
There was nothing in the cake, in any other way than this, 
of a deleterious character.

Upon this evidence^at the close of the plaintiff&apos;s case, i862. 

Pollock, C. B., said, there was no evidence of any 
warranty. The case was very different from that of a per- 
son who professed to manufacture and sell food for cattle, 
or sold cake expressly for that purpose. The defendant only 
sold the cake, the refuse of his crushing-mills, just as it 
was after the oil was expressed from the linseed. It was for 
the plaintiff to see if it was fit for feeding his cattle or not. 
There must be a verdict for the defendant. 

On this the plaintiff yielded to a

Pigott^ Serjt., and Holland for the defendant. 

The plaintiff had been a passenger on the Eastern 
Counties line, in a train which met with a collision, in 
which he was somewhat hurt. At the station he was sent 
by the railway company&apos;s servants to the defendant, their 
surgeon, who asked him where he was injured, to which 
the plaintiff answered in his face and arm, his face being 
then bleeding from a blow which did not turn out to be 
serious. The defendant made the usual applications for 
those visible hurts, and on his next visit, considering that, 
as he said, he was more frightened than hurt, he sent him 
to certain of the company&apos;s authorities, who gave him 6/., 
for which he signed a receipt as taken in satisfaction. 
Next day he came again, and got the defendant to examine 
his abdomen, where he professed to have been injured, 
and on this it was discovered that he was ruptured. The 
plaintiff applied for further compensation, which was 
refused, and he then sued the company for the injury. 
They pleaded the receipt of the 5Z. in full discharge, and 
he replied fraud. The case was tried before Martin, B., 
who directed the jury that there was no evidence of fraud, 
and the company had a verdict. Thereupon the present 
action was brought against the defendant, the surgeon,

who had never been paid or retained by the plaintiff^ nor 1862. 
agreed to tell him what his injuries were ; nor did it appear 
that he had been told by the plaintiff before the receipt of 
the 51. that he had any external hurt, otherwise than what 
was visible ; and although the plaintiff said he had com- 
plained of his bowels, he did not say that he had told the 
defendant there was anything apparent in his abdomen, or 
any external symptoms of injury. And at the former trial 
the case for the company was, that the rupture was an 
old one. 

On the plaintiff&apos;s evidence, 

Bramwell, B., said there was no proof, either of a 
contract toith the plaintiffs nor of any injury sustained by 
him, as a result of any neglect on the part of the defendant 
to examine him (the only duty laid or proved). There 
was, therefore, no ground of action, and consequently the 
plaintiff must be 

Nonsuited {a). 

(a) This case is not at all at va- the result of it. Even assuming a 
nance with those which show that duty to the plaintiff duly to examine 
if a stranger retain a surgeon to him, there was none even alleged 
tend a person, the surgeon is liable to tiaie to him the result ; and it 
to that person for want of due and was to the want of knowing the re- 
proper care. But that action would suit, (even supposing his injuries 
be founded on injury, the result of were as he stated,) that his accept- 
negligence, of which, in this case, ance of the 5/., on his own thowing, 
there was no evidence ; i. a. neither was to be ascribed, 
of the negligence nor of any injury,

Issue being on the defendant. 

The defendant had ordered a gun to be made on a 
certain principle of his, for the purpose of exemplifying 
it, with a Tiew to experiments upon it by the Ordnance. 

The gun was made upon his principle, and in the course 
of making it the plaintiff informed him of some minor 
defects in it. When it was made, the defendant came 
down to look at it, but as the rifling machine was in it, he 
could not see its inside. 

On the 2nd of July it was sent by his orders to Wool- 
wich, and on the 5th of July he sent the bill of exchange. 

The gun was fired several times, and answered satis- 
factorily, and served to exemplify the defendant&apos;s prin- 
ciple. It was afterwards fired six times, with increasing 
charges of powder, in order to test it ; at the seventh it 
burst. 

And evidence was offered to show that this was through 
a flaw in the gun, into which a plug had been found 
inserted. [There was no evidence when the plaintiff 
became aware of the flaw.] 

Upon this evidence being opened.

to an action on a bill for it, as there . 
might he if there were a breach of 
warranty, or the artide was not 
what was bought, as if not according 
to sample ; Camac v. Warriner, 1 
C. B. 356; Hooper v. Trtffrey, I 
Exch. 17. But this has never been 
held oiwowndneu; and temble, that 
there is an implied warranty of 
soundness, by the maker of any- 
thing, and against flaws he knows of; 
and here the plug showed that the 
flaw was known and concealed. 
The flaw ordinarily would sustain an 
action for a breach ot warrant j^f apart 
from fraud, if it made the gun unfit 
for ordinary use ; for there is always 
a warranty by a maker, that the 
article is sound and fit for cT&apos; 
dinary use ( Brown v. Edginton^ 2 
M.&amp;G. 279; Shepherd v. Pybut, 
Ibid. ; 4 Sc. N. R. 434) ; but not that 
it is fit for the purpose for which 
the buyer designed it, even although 
the maker knew it (Ibid.); and of 
course this must be H multo for^ 
tiori, where, as here, the gun was 
made on the buyer*s plan and prin- 
ciple. For it is so even when the 
article is made on the teUer&apos;t prin- 
ciple, if it is a specific article ; Pri- 
deaux v. M* Murray , auU, p. 225. 



Now, here, there was no proof that 
the gun was unsound to such an ex- 
tent as to be unfit for ordinary use ; 
on the contrary, there was proof 
that it was not so ; for it was fired 
six times, and burst onl}&apos; on in- 
creased charges of powder, and this 
might have been through the fault 
of the buyer* t own principle of con- 
struction ; and if so, then, though 
the maker even knew it, there was 
no defence. In regard to fraud, 
there must not only be evidence of 
fraud, but that thereby the buyer 
was induced to purchase. There 
was no proof of firaud, for the 
reason above stated, (for conceal- 
ment does not prove fraud); and 
there was no evidence of any false 
statement to defendant, still less of 
any which induced him to accept. 
See Clark v. Holmes^ p. 79, as to 
the onm of proof. 

(o) It could not possibly be 
proved that it burst by reason of the 
flaw, as it might have been if it 
had burst the first time, or the 
charges had all been ordinary. 
There was only, at utmost, an im- 
plied warranty that it was sound 
for ordinary charges ; vide supra,

±N this case the magistrates had refused to commit the 
prisoner on a charge which was within the provisions of 
the 22&amp;23 Vict. c. 17; and the prosecutor thereopoo&apos;, 
under the 2nd section of that act, required the magistrate - 
to take his recognizance to prosecute on the chaise, in 
order that he might prefer his indictment before the grand 
jury at the assizes (a). 

Wheelhouse now applied to discharge the prosecutor&apos;s 
recognizances herein on the part of the prosecution. 

Keating, J.— Under the 2nd section of the statute, 
notwithstanding the magistrate refuses to commit, the pro- 
secutor insists on going on; and under that section, on 
entering into his recognizances, the magistrates are by 
that statute bound to take them, and he cannot now be 
discharged from his recognizances ; he must either go on or 
have his recognizances forfeited. To hold that be might 
be dischaiiged from his recognizances would be defeating a 
yery useful act of parliament.

WELLOCK V. CONSTANTINE. 

JLHE declaration Btated, that the defendant assaulted 
and beat the plaintiiF, and forcibly violated her, and car- 
nally knew her (a), whereby she became with child,&amp;c. 



(a) This is not an indictment 
Ar rape, (even though the words 
*&apos; forcibly violated&quot; were in substance 
of the same effect as &apos;&lt;rapuit,&quot; and 
the word *&apos; feloniously&quot; only a tech- 
nical term, where the rest of (he 
indictment charges the faett ne- 
cessary to constitute the ofTeuce;) 
for it claims damage ; and so there 
was jurisdiction under the commis- 
sion oin&apos;uipr&apos;mi to try it, (i. e. as an 
issue of damages, which is neces- 
sarily incident to a civil suit), whe- 
ther or not there was also jurisdic- 
tion to try it under the commission 
of oyer and terminer, as an in- 
quisition or presentment prelimin- 
ary to an indictment. It cannot, 
therefore, be said, the nonsuit waa 
wrong; as if the Judge had no 
jurisdiction to direct a verdict, 
|hen, on the same principle, the 
Court could have no jurisdiction 
to direct a new trial. In caxes 
where the defendant justifies upon 
a felony by the plaintiff, it has 
been held, that the verdict for 
the defendant operates as a pre- 
sentment or indictment by a grand 
jury. There, as here, there is 
jurisdiction to try the issue, as 
a crime of another may be a de- 
/ence. That the point arises on 
the general issue (whether or not it 
alto arises on the record) appears 



from this, that the declaration 
always implies, what formerly was 
expreued in the allegation, that the 
tort was to the damage of the plain- 
tiff, i. e. under such circumstances 
as to give a claim to damages, 
which, indeed, is of the essence of 
the civil action. And if by a rule 
of 1^ it is not so, this will sustain 
a verdict for the defendant, the al- 
legation of right to recover damage 
being disproved ; just as where, in 
cases of slander, privileged, the al- 
legation of malice is disproved, or 
the allegation of special damage is 
essential, and it is not shown. And, 
even putting it no higher than that 
an action is premature, the case 
would resemble that of credit unex- 
pired, which, whether or not it arise 
on the record as it may^ can also be 
raised on the general issue. So of 
an action for malicious prosecution 
brought before the criminal pro- 
ceedings are ended ; whether or not 
it u alleged and denied that they 
are, so, on a principle of public 
policy, it would appear that there 
* was no right of action. It is no dif- 
ficulty that a verdict for the defend* 
ant on that ground would hejinal^ 
as the plaintiff may avoid such a 
verdict by electing to be non- 
suited.

792 CASES ON THE 

1862. Plea: not goilty. 

Wellock Overend and Jones for the plaintiff. 

CoMSTAMTiNB. Price foT the defendant. 

Overendf in opening the case for the plaintiff, did not 
state it as a case of rape, but said that probably she would 
go beyond the mere charge of an assault, and that a gross 
and barbarous assault no doubt had been committed, re- 
sulting in childbirth, and thus causing great damage. 

The plaintiff was called, and stated that the defendant 
had seized her, thrown her down, and at once violated her. 
She described it as all one continuous act, and swore 
positively that it was against her will. On cross-exami* 
nation, she said it was a rape, but admitted matters which 
went to discredit this statement, as she not having at once 
complained,&amp;c. 

The father of the plaintiff was called, and it appeared 
that when she had complained to her mother a conversation 
. took place between all parties, in which he stated that if 
a child did not come, he would say nothing more about it ; 
but that if his daughter had a child, he should expect 
some amends. 

Upon this evidence, 

WiLLES, J., said that the charge was one of rape, or it 
was nothing; and though, as there was no corroborative 
proof, most likely in a criminal court the defendant would 
be acquitted, yet, as the charge was clearly one of rape, it 
was contrary to public policy to allow it to be made the 
subject of a civil action until it had been the subject of a 
criminal prosecution. The plaintiff, on her own showing, 
can only recover by proving a rape; for if she consented, 
then it is clear that she cannot sue for seduction (a). But 

(a) That if she consented at any for the attaull he/ore her cootent 

time, it was not a rape. See R. v. See Detborotigh v. Holmes, Vol. 1, 

Fletcher, 28 L. J., M. C. S5. p. 6. Sed qumre, even as to that; 

Tliat if it was not so, she could sue the act being entire. 



NORTHERN CIRCUIT. 



793 



if she did not consent, and it was all against her will, then 

it is a rape, and it is contrary to public policy to allow it 

to be made a matter merely of civil suit for damage. The 

plaintiff, therefore, must be called, or I roust direct a 

verdict for the defendant. 

Thereupon Overend yielded to a 

Nonsuit (a). 



(o) In Easter Term, Ocerend got a 
rule in the Exch , vthxch was argued

deny the general principle, that, in 
a case of felony, there cannot be a 
civil suit against the Jelon before a 
criminal prosecution {Crosbjf v. 
J^ng, 12 East, 409), but doubted 
whether the question arose on the 
general issue, and whether the pro- 
per course was to direct a verdict 
for the defendant^ or to discharge 
the jury and strike out the cause. 
As to the first point, it is conceived 
that the matter is not one of mere 
defence on the part of the defend- 
ant, but is to be raised by the 
Judge in the interests of public jus-

tice, — paramount to both parties, 
and— the very mischief being the 
compromise of criminal charges,— 
it is obvious that the defendant, the 
felon, is not likely to plead it; and 
in ancient times, when all felonies 
were capital, parties were still less 
likely to do so. There is no in- 
stance of any plea raising the ques- 
tion, and it is always stated as a/H 
pearifig to the Court upon the evi- 
dence. And, it is conceived, it is 
for the Judge whether there is • 
charge of rape (not whether it is 
proved) ; and that, if so, it is for 
him, as a matter of law^ to direct • 
verdict, even though he has a du*

It appeared that the charter was made on the 24th of 
October, and that on the 30th of October the ship, having 
gone to Newcastle to get her coal, the master saw the 
manager of the Marly Hill Colliery^ and told him he 
was to load there coke. On the 7th of November (he 
master, having taken the coals on board, saw the manager, 
and told him so, and that he was ready to receive the 
coke. The coke was not loaded, and on the 2nd of 
December the master saw the manager again, and asked 
why it was, and was told there were several ships on the 
&apos;&apos;turn&quot; before his, which were in course of being loaded. 
He was also told that several ships which had not been 
ready had now got ready, and that his could not be loaded 
that week, nor the next. He saw the manager again on 
the 15th of January, but could not get loaded, nor did he 
begin to receive his cargo until the 20th of January, nor 
complete it until the 25th. [Demurrage was claimed 
from the time the coal was in, and the ship ready to 
receive the coke, i.e. from the 7th of November to the 
20th of January, deducting a fortnight] 

The plaintiflfs evidence was, that it was usual to be 
loaded within a fortnight. The master, however, could 
not say what was the reasonable number of vessels to be &apos; 
loaded, and admitted that the &quot; turn&quot; varied according to 
the number of vessels ready to be loaded, and the time 
was sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. He knew 
there was a book kept at the colliery, in which were 
entered the names of the ships to be loaded, but he had not 
looked at it to see what ships were entered. He had only 
asked the usual time, and was told it was about a fort- 
night. He took in the coal, without making any inquiries

as to the number of ships waiting to be loaded. The 1862. 
book was kept by the colliery for its own purposes. It 
did not appear that it was generally known, but evidence 
was tendered for the defendant that it was so, and the 
witnesses for the defendant stated that it had been&apos; kept 
for twenty years, and that vessels had, during all that 
time, been loaded in their ^&apos; turn/&apos; according to the order of 
their entry in the book. But it appeared that ships were 
entered therein, not only before they were ready to load, 
but before their arrival at the dock, or even at the port, 
and that if a ship was not ready in its turn, it was allowed 
to come in when it was ready, even before others which 
bad been ready before it. The defendant&apos;s witnesses, 
however, denied any preference or priority. And it ap- 
peared that the Marly Hill Company were the only 
makers of the Marly Hill coke, and that they only allowed 
vessels to load it at their &quot; spout,&quot; according to the &quot; turn&apos;* 
in their book. 

WiLLES, J. (to the jury).— What is the meaning of the 
words &quot; regular turn ?&quot; Common sense implies what is 
rectsonable, &quot; first come, first served.&quot; Does the colliery 
book make any difference ? Consider what is the reason- 
able order of loading, whether it is according to the book, 
or in the order in which the ships are ready? If the 
latter, then the book goes for nolhing. There may be 
another question — What is a reasonable time? AH the 
circumstances are to be considered. First, was the vessel 
loaded in its regular turn? If not, how much time was 
lost? 

The jury found that the ship was loaded according to 

the colliery order, but that the usage was not known and 

established, and that ** regular turns&quot; meant the order in 

which the ships were ready, not according to the colliery 

book.

paper was badly packed ; but this defect of paper package 
&apos;was visible and apparent, and might have been remedied

The goods, when delivered to the plaintiff, were much

At the close of the case for the plaintiff, 

Temple submitted that there ought to be a nonsuit ; but 

Crompton, J., thought there was a case for the jury, 
though there was no direct evidence of any act of negli-

At the close of the case for the defendant, 

Crompton, J. (to the jury). — ^The question for you is, 
first, was there any damage to the goods while they were 
in the defendands&quot; hands as carriers ? [To this the jury 
answered in the affirmative.] Secondly. Was such damage 
owing, partially, to the state in which the goods were 
delivered to the defendants? [To this, also, the jury 
answered in the affirmative.] 

The learned Judge thereupon directed the jury that 
they should find for the plaintiff for such damages as they 
thought had been caused by the want of care on the part 
of the defendants* servants. 

The jury accordingly found a 

Verdict for the plaintiff, damages 40/. (a). 



(a) In Hil.Tern, 1862, Temple 
moved, in the Exchequer, on the 
ground of misdirection, and also 
that the verdict was against the 
evidence. But the Court refused a 
rule on either ground, conceiving 
that there was evidence of damage 
to the goods through want of due 



care on the part of the defendants, 
and that the learned Judge had 
given them the full benefit of any 
want of care in the packing, which 
went merely to the damage, and 
not to the cause of action ; the da- 
mage having only been partially 
caused thereby.

This closed the case for the plaintiffs. 

HayeSf Seijtj then submitted that there was no case for 
the jury; no legal damage. It was slander of a married 
woman, by which it was alleged that she had lost the

from the defendant&apos;s slander. If a person made use of 
slanderous language and a third person repeated it, it was 
not actionable; Ward ▼. Weeks {a). The husband heard 
nothing of the slander except through the report of the 
wife; the damage, therefore, was in consequence of the 
repetition of the slander, and not of the slander itself. 

Williams, J. — ^Although the general law is as you state,

(a) That is, maintenance in con- 
sideration of money to be paid. 

(h) Not merely claimed^ but 
held and possessed by her, and of 
\rhich she was seised. Mainte- 
nance no doubt may be by main- 
taining a tenant as well as a de- 
mandant; but it is defined as 
maintaining a suit *&apos;to the hin- 
drance or disturbance of right&quot; 
(2 Inst. 208) ; therefore it will be 
maintenance in any one who un- 
hwfidfy sustains or supports a 
tenant or demandant in a cause 
pending in a suit, by word, writing, 
countenance or deed (2 Inst. 208 ; 
Co. Lit. 368 b). And strangers 
retaining counsel may be guilty of 
it (2 Rol. 77), but not the coumel 
himielf, merely by supporting the 
client ; at all events, if not from an 
improper motive, unless the coun- 
sel knows that the client has no 
right. But even if the client had 
not, as in this case, gained judg^ 
ment, it would hardly be in the 
client&apos;s mouth to say that she had 
been maintained &quot;against right.&quot; 
And though, even after judgment, 
the opposite party might indict or 
sue for maintenance against a 
stranger who has supported the 
successful litigant, it would never 
be possible for the successful litigant 
to set it up unless as an answer to 
a claim for remuneration for the 
maintenance. That would come 
within the defence of maintenance 
(although it would be something 
more than maintenance) in the case 
of a stranger. But counsel cannot 



be deemed legally a stranger to a 
suit, or as unlawfully maintaining, 
unless the bargain for reward be 
BO. That is something quite dis- 
tinct from mere maintenance : in 
which the offence lies is the maiit- 
taining ;. so that if that is not 
per se, or by reason of the motive, 
unlawful, the offence of maintenance 
is not committed. The question, 
therefore, on this plea, would be, 
whether the agreement by counsel 
for money to be paid after, upon 
and dependent upon, the event of 
^he suit being in favor of the client, 
makes counsel&apos;s maintaining the 
suit &quot;unlawful,&quot; which would 
otherwise be clearly lawful. There 
was no evidence in this case of 
anything else to make it unlawful. 
It by no means indeed is a con- 
clusion of law, at all events in 
considering the question of main- 
tenance, from the fact that the 
event of the suit was in favor of 
the client, that therefore there was 
no legal wrong or injury to the 
other party ; and in law the suc- 
cessful party might set up the de- 
fence to an action founded on a 
contract for money as the reward 
of mainteuance, though she could 
hardly sue or indict for the 
maintenance itself. But the yery 
mischief of maintenance is the 
encouragement of litigation, which 
though legally, as far as the 
evidence in the suit goes, is pre- 
sumed to have reached a right 
result, yet, through defects of evi- 
dence, death or absence of wit-

nesses, and the like, the result may 
not be in accordance with justice 
and truth. And there was strong 
reason, from the evidence of the 
plaintiff himself, to suspect that that 
was so in the suit in question ; since 
the success of his client, it is pretty 
clear, was the result of the absence 
of two witnesses, whose cross-ex- 
amination would very likely have 
been fatal to his client. But though 
this might prove that the evil and 
mischief of maintenance had in fact 
arisen in this case (so far as re- 
gards the injury to the other party), 
there was no evidence that the 
result was owing to any contrivance 
of his; so that on that ground 
there was no evidence that his 
maintaining his client was *&apos; un- 
lawful.&quot; And therefore the case 
would seem to have come to this, 
whether a bargain or understanding 
by counsel, pending a suit for reward 
to be paid by his client in the event 
of the suit being in favor of the 
client, made his maintaining her 
cause unlawful. And that, it will 
be seen, was the point on which 
the Lord Chief Justice put the case, 
and, as it is conceived, correctly. 

(a) This allegation, however ma- 
terial to the pUiit as one of mere 
maintenance, had little to do with 
the real ground of defence ; and on 
the other hand, the allegation that 
there was no reasonable ground 
for the suit as regards the client&apos;s 
claim, which of course was not, as it 
could hardly have been, made on 
her behalf, would seem from the 
later authorities to be material to 
the plea as one of maintenance 



(vide post); though, quare, as to 
the more ancient cases, which seem 
to show that the offence and mis- 
chief of maintenance are the same, 
whether the suit were will or ill 
founded in law. 

(b) This again, however material 
to the plea as one of mere main- 
tenance, was, rather beside the real 
defence, which was, that the plain- 
tiff* had an interest in the land, in 
this sense, that he had an interest 
in maintaining the client&apos;s title to 
it ; for assuming this alleged agree- 
ment to have been valid, he was 
her creditor; and, as a creditor, 
had an interest to insure his debtor&apos;s 
life, and so had an interest to main- 
tain his debtor&apos;s title. Here again 
the question would come to this 
therefore, whether the original 
agreement for reward to depend on 
the event or result, was contrary to 
public policy : and that question of 
course turns on whether it is con- 
trary to public policy that counsel 
in a suit should have a direct per- 
sonal pecuniary interest in the event. 
But the plea does not allege that 
the plaintiff* acted and made the 
agreement atcounielf or that he was 
counsel in the suit ; although, per- 
haps, it would be open to i-aise the 
question under the allegation that 
he unlawfuUjf maintained his client 
the defendant, or that he illegally 
agreed ; the generality of a plea is 
no ground of objection after verdict, 
if on any fair construction of it on 
the facts found or admitted by the 
plaintiff* it raises a defence. 

(c) That is, to public policy, by 
reason of the agreement virtually

little whether the case be regarded 
as it arises on the general issue, or on 
special plea {ut tttpra), or whether 
the plea he regarded as one of main- 
tenance or champerty. If there 
were no precedent agreements for 
money, or no valid binding agree* 
ment, there could have been no- 
thing of which to state an account, 
which is always (see the old forms) 
of debts and demands already ex- 
isting, and this would arise on the 
general issue. If there were (as 
the plaintiff stated) any such agree- 
ment, then it must fall within the 
mischief either of maintenance or 
of champerty, or of something con- 
trary to public policy, and worse 
than either. The maintaining by 
counsel, as already shown, could only 
here have been unlawful by reason 
of the previous agreement, as, per 
ie, it is lawful (Bro. Abr., Maynie&apos; 
nance; 17 Com. Dig., ibid. A.). 
That agreement might or might not 
amount to champerty, which is the 
worst kind of maintenance (Ibid.), 
and implies it, though non 2 conter$o 
(Bro. Abr., Mayntenancef 19 ; 15 
Hen. 7, c. 2), and as champerty it 
maintenance, a party may raise the 
defence of maintenance on facts 
showing champerty ; ( Ibid. c. 3 ; 9 
Hen. 6, c. 64). But as regards 
counsel, the essence of the offence 
of champerty would seem to be the 
making a reward depend upon the 
result of a suit. For the offence is 
not committed merely by conveying 
to counsel a portion of the estate, 
unless it were the estate to be re- 



covered, and the gift were to be 
ajler recovery and in pursaaoee of 
a previous bargain ; (Bro. Abr., 
Champertie, 3; 12 Hen. 4, c 26); 
and, on the other hand, the oflfenoe 
would seem to be committed, if 
moiiey, the produce or proceeds of 
the suit, is contracted to be received 
as a reward for service in the suit; 
(Ibid. 6 ; 15 Hen. 7, c 2). And as 
the only reason for delaying pay- 
ment can be that the ability to pay 
directly or indirectly appears to de- 
pend upon the result of the suit, it 
is obvious that a contract to pay 
connsd money after the result of a 
suit, must, if it ever could be a con- 
tract at all, contain in it the esseaee 
and the miaekiefoi the (^enee of 
champerty, for it would make the 
reward depend in effect upon the 
result But though there is ample 
authority for contracts to pay coon- 
■el, and plenty of cases of suck 
contracts, there is not a vestige of 
authority for, nor a solitary instance 
of, any contract to pay counsel for

imported only advice, because it 
was always held that the client 
must attend the counwel to get it, 
and that the counsel was not bound 
to attend, and it was not necessary 
to show that he gave counsel if he

were ready to give it when required, 
(Ibid. 23; 9£dw.4, c48; Ibid., 
Condition, 133). And thougb the 
not giving couniel when required 
might forfeit the annuity, (Ibid. 
*61), that was by way of condition 
subeequent, and the grant was 
always present and absolute, and 
in no way dependent upon any 
remit, but took immediate effect. 
So that, even if they had related 
to suits at law, they would be free 
from any taint of champerty, just 
as much so as the payment of fees 
would be. No trace can be found of 
eontracti to pay fees to counsel for 
their exertions in and abomt a suit 
or suits. There are many cases 
in which their retainer in suits is 
alluded to (20 Hen. 6, c. 35); but 
it is clear that the word retainer 
always implied the pre-^ymeai of 
the fee (Bro. Abr. Mayntenanee, 
34; 6 Edw. 4, c 5; Ibid. c. 44; 
81 Hen. 6, c. 9). It would hate 
been clearly contrary to public po- 
licy to allow counsel to soe for their 
reward, because it would lead surely 
to champerty and something worse. 
The mischief and ofience of cham- 
perty lay only in the encourage- 
ment of Utigation, although even 
in a legal sense just. Indeed the 
ofience rather implied that the liti- 
gation kept up was legally just, or 
else there could be no mischief to 
the party against whom it was kept 
up. And at all events it did noi 
imply that the litigation was kept 
up by bad or unfkfr practices. 
But to have allowed counsel to 
bargain for reward to be paid or 
rendered after the result, and there- 
fbre to make their reward depend 
on the result, would have been 



to give them a direct interest in Kbmmedt 
the result, and thus tend to in- Broun 
duce them to act contrary to their et Uxor, 
duty to public justice. This mis- 
chief would be all the greater, be- 
cause in ancient times the counsel 
had in effect the whole conduct of 
the suit, (since Serjeants are a far 
more ancient order than attomies, 
and originally pleadings were oral), 
and to this day have the cAi^^ con- 
duct of it, and the $oU conduct of 
it in court ; in all stages of it, at- 
tomies acting by their advice, and 
under their authority. Hence our 
greatest judges, in every age, have 
laid it down, that counsel are a kind 
of ministers of justice and right 
(Holt, C. J., 6 Mod. 137); i. e. 
to this extent, that they are open 
to censure if they act wilfully 
against truth and justice (Ibid.). 
There is the well-known instance 
in Savndert, where that learned 
counsel was severely rebuked for 
artifice; and there was a similar 
case before Lord Mansfield. Thus 
it was on principles of public policy, 
far wider than the mere scope of 
the ofience of champerty, that it 
was always held that counsel could 
not sue for their fees as such; 
Charley t. Boycott, 4 T. R. 317. 
And this principle would apply d 
mnito Jbrtiori to any exertions of 
theirs not as counsel, in the course 
of, and in aid c^, a suit. For the 
motive and interest being the same, 
the mischief would be all the greater, 
in that their agency would be more 
secret and latent, and beyond the 
light and cognizance of the Court. 
Thus, for example, it might lead 
counsel, in their anxiety to obtain 
a verdict in which thev bad a direct

Kbnnbdt pecuniary iDtere$t, to resort to such 
&quot;• means of influencing a jury — by 

ec Uxor ^^^ publication of pamphlets or the 
like — as might, even in the party 
himself, be an offence against jus- 
tice and an indictable misdemeanor ; 
Rex V. Joiiffe, 4 T. R. 285 ; and 
would of course in counsel be an 
offence all the graver, on account 
of his peculiar duty to justice. 
Thus it has been laid down in our 
own times, by the most eminent 
judges, ** that as it is of importance 
to the public that counsel should 
act with integrity and independ- 
ence, therefore it is that they can 
maintain no action for their fees, in 
order that their emoluments may not 
depend on the retuit of the cause ; 
Morris v. Hunt, I Chitty&apos;s Rep. 
544. As already observed, this 
principle applies d muUoJbrtiori to 
services by counsel in and about 
and in aid of a suit, though not 
strictly or properly within his pro- 
vince as such ; and this for many 
reasons. He cannot properly do 
anything in and about and in aid 
of a suit save as counsel, and it 
does not lie in his mouth to say 
that he has done so. If he could, he 
would only fall more surely into 
the offence of maintenance or cham- 
perty; for there would (in the 
case supposed) be a pecuniary mo- 
tive for his aid; and that, in a 
stranger, would amount to that 
offence ; the privilege of counsel, 
of course, not attaching to anything 
beyond his province or duty as such. 
Nor could it be competent to coun- 
sel at his pleasure to denude him- 
self of his character of counsel in 
a suit If he could do so for one 
purpose he might for others; and 



what would become of the seal of 
secresy, and obligation of confi- 
dence ? In anything he might as- 
sume to do in a suit, not as coansel, 
he would act with all the know- 
ledge acquired as counsel ; with all 
the skUl of counsel ; with the mo- 
tive acting upon him in his cha- 
racter of counsel ; in pursuance of 
one entire purpose and object ; all 
with the same intent^ and all there- 
fore within the same mischief. 

Although, therefore, it baa been 
held, that counsel may sue on con- 
tracts for reward in respect of ser- 
vices not as counsel, nor in aid of a 
suit {Egan v. The Guardians&lt;f 
the Kensington Union^ 3 Q. B. Rep. 
935), it has never been so held of 
services in aid of a suit On the 
contrary, the opposite principle has 
been recognized in the cases where 
it was held that counsel in a suit, in 
which he has acted as such, cannot 
be called as a witness; Dunn v. 
Packwaod, 11 Jur. 242; Stones. 
Byron, ibid. 44 ; 16 L. J., Q. B. 32. 
And of course there is an additional 
objection where the services are such 
as are properly within the province 
of an attorney ; Doe d. Bennett v. 
Hall, 15 Q. B. 171. These prin- 
ciples were all recognized in the 
case of Swinfen v. Lord Chelmrford, 
5 H.&amp;N. 89t&gt;, so closely con- 
nected with thepresent(oM/eVol. I., 
p. 610) ; and it is conceived that the 
practical result is, that counsel can 
maintain no action for services in 
and about and in aid of a suit at 
law or equity. If so, this of course 
would be a defence on the general 
issue. See per L. C. J., post.

sufficient to sustain this form of 
action. This is quite apart from 
the question of illegality, whether 
on the ground of maintenance, 
champerty, or anything contrary to 
public policy. As to which, vide

to preclude recovery on the account

was sworn and gave evidence, and at the close of the case 
replied. 

The plaintiff was a barrister. The alleged account had 
been stated with Mrs. Swinfen before her marriage with 
Mr. Broun. 

In 1856) Mrs. Swinfen was in possession of the Swinfen 
estate (where she had resided for some years) as devisee 
under the will of her late husband&apos;s father. A suit had 
been instituted against her by the heir at law to recover 
the estate, and an issue demsavii vel nan had been directed 
by the Court of Chancery to try the validity of the decree, 
which the heir impeached on the ground of undue influ- 
ence on her part over the testator. By the form of this 
issue Mrs. Swinfen was made plaintiffs but in reality, as 
she was in possession, the heir was claimant or demand- 
ant, and she was tenant. In March, 1866, the issue came 
on for trial, and, chiefly from dread of the evidence of two 
of her own witnesses, Mrs. Lishman and Mrs. Charles 
Swinfen, her counsel compromised her claim for an annuity. 

The plaintiff was soon afterwards introduced to Mrs. 
Swinfen. She was still in possession of the estate, and she 
had always continued to be so. She told him of the com- 
promise which her counsel had entered into, and she con- 
sulted him about it He disapproved of it, and ultimately, 
by his advice, she determined to resist it. According to 
the plaintiff&apos;s evidence she told him that she desired that 
he should conduct her case, and he conferred with her 
attorney about it, the plaint}^ stipulating that he should

was engaged in the suits, and who did the usual business 
of an attorney, and the plaintiff received briefs from him in

(a) There would, it is conceived, 
be nothing in this going beyond 
the province or duty of counsel; 
on the oontFury, it is believed that 
in ancient timet the control exer- 
cised by counsel in the course and 
ceuduet of a ease was&amp;r greater 
than it is now ; for which reaeoo it 
was deemed so essential that their 
reward should not depend on the 
result, vide ante, p. 804. 

In andeni times, at already 
mentioned, &apos;* deeds granting an- 
nuities to counsel pro connlio were 
very common; and although no 
doubt, in tome cases, these deeds 
were to nl/tmief, who were often 
called * counter learned in the law&quot; 
(tee catet cited, Chelmiford v. 
Swin/eth 29 L. J., Ex. 388, ta 
fiolif), yet, on the other hand, it it 
clear from the context of the catet 
and from contemporary workt — 
toch at the PaUon Leiten — that 
tuch deedt were often to teijeantt 
or barrittert, and equally dear that 
the *&apos; counter* might be required 
by the dient in or about a tuit, 
and that the countd ioa« given 
direct to the elienit withomt the in- 
tervention qf an attorney. This it 
dear from all the catet, and the 
contemporary writert, from Chaucer 
down to the time of the Lord 
Keeper North; and of course it 
would follow that the attorney 
would be, — at be ought to be, at the 
mandatory of the client, who acted 
under the advice of countel,— con- 
trolled by countd in the coune and 



conduct of the tuit, instead of conn- 
ed being the mandatories of the 
attomiet,at appeart to have been 
contidered by thote who approved 
of the action of Swinfen v. Lord 
Chelmtfordf vide mpra, and 5 H.&amp;N. 896. In that cate, however, 
the original and correct doctrine 
wat revived and broadly laid down, 
per Pollock, C. B. And in Doe 
d. Bennett v. Hale^ 15 Q. B. Rep. 
171, it wat laid down that there 
wat no rule of law even agalntt a 
party in a civil tuit having the 
atdttance of countel inttructed by 
himself, inttead of by an attorney, at 
it oonttantly the practice in cri- 
minal catet, although the Court 
thought it not,4M a general prac- 
tice, tatitiactoiy, and no doubt 
it it not. But that it a very dif- 
ferent thing from the dient having 
the advantage of the direct advice 
of the countel at to the conduct of 
a toit in or out of Court, the coun- 
tel not of courte taking any ttep 
or doing any businett usually done 
by attomies. It did not appear that 
the plaintiff in the present cate had 
done to ; on ihe contrary, the attor- 
ney did all the usual buuness as such. 
And (except, perhaps, in seeing 
tome of the witnetses) it did not 
appear that the plaintiff had done 
an3rthing at all out of the proper 
province of counsel, as illustrated 
by the cate above referred to, and 
anything which he would not have 
been bound to do under a grant of 
an annuity pro comilio*

conversation with her respecting his remuneration, which, 
as he represented, was to this effect, &apos;&apos; that she could not 
remunerate him now, but would amply hereafter,** and that 
he said he must wait. 

In December, 1856, the case came on in the Common 
Pleas, and the plaintiff conducted it for Mrs. Swinfen. He 
received fees in the usual way. The Court were divided, 
and did not enforce the compromise. 

After this there were proceedings in Chancery to set 
aside the compromise. These also he conducted on her 
part with success. In April, 1856, the Court set aside the 
compromise, and ordered a second trial of the issue as to 
the validity of the devise. Pending these proceedings, the 
plaintiff said, he, at her request, made the acquaintance of 
Mr. and Mrs. C. Swinfen, the former of whom was one of 
the witnesses to the will, his wife being the witness, a 
statement by whom to the attorney having been the main 
reason of the compromise which had been entered into. 
Both of them she deemed doubtful or dangerous witnesses, 
and on this account desired that he should become ac- 
quainted with them. He desired to know a certain state- 
ment she was said to have made to the attorney on the 
subject, and was informed of it. He saw Mrs. Charles 
Swinfen and learned certain statements of hers as to the 
matter (a). These he deemed very unfavorable to her 
cause, and he represented that he had advised her to accept 
an offer on the part of the heir of an estate for her life. 
Mrs. Swinfen, however, had desired him to press Mrs. 
Charles Swinfen to come forward at the second trial as a 
witness for the will, and to urge upon her, in order to in- 
duce her to do so, that she would otherwise be involved in

The plaintiflf said he had met her as an acquaintance at 
Mrs. Swinfeu&apos;s. And so as to the other witnesses he saw. 

After the now plaintiff had seen and conversed with 
Mrs. Charles Swinfen she was placed in confinement as 
a lunatic. It did not appear who was the promoter of 
this proceeding. The result, however, was, that an order 
was obtained to read her evidence at the trial. A similar 
order was also obtained as to Mrs. Lishman (whose cross- 
examination had on the first trial&apos;proved so dangerous) on 
the ground of illness. The now plaintiff said he told Mrs. 
Swinfen that her prospects were much improved by this. 
And he saw Mr. Charles Swinfen on the eve of the second 
trial, and also saw Dr. Rowley, and spoke with him respect- 
ing his evidence as to&apos;the state of the testator&apos;s mind. 

The plaintiff stated that at this time Mrs. Swinfen was 
constantly talking of the suit as one in which they were 
both interested, and in which success would be to his ad- 
vantage as well as hers. Expressions, such as &quot; We will 
stand or fall together,&quot; and the like, were used (&amp;). She 
said, in alluding to his loss of time and business, that she 
&apos;&apos; would make it up to him(c) ;&quot; and, as he himself stated, if 
she had failed she would not have had the means of do-

There was an application in Chancery against it, on 
which the plaintiff conducted her case, and the verdict was 
confirmed. 

In February, 1868, after the suit was thus settled, in 
consequence of a letter from Mrs. Swinfen&apos;s attorney (upon 
the occasion of the taxation of costs) about fees, the 
plaintiff wrote that he had undertaken the case without 
fees, out of friendship, but that as he knew if ke did not 
receive fees the other side would not have to pay them, he 
would accept fees. 

He accordingly received above 700/. for fees, such as 
would be allowed as between party and party.

In March, 1869, as he stated, occurred the conversation 
he relied on as evidence of the account stated, viz., he said 
to her, &apos;&apos; You have several times mentioned 20,000/. ; do 
you consider yourself as owing me that amount?&apos; She 
answered, ** Certainly, but that he could not have it at pre- 
sent;&quot; on which he pressed for security, and ultimately a 
deed was agreed to. 

In May, 1859, this deed was executed, reciting that the 
plaintiff had rendered her services for which she desired to 
remunerate him, and charging the estate with 20,000/. (c). 

In November, 1861, Mrs. Broun repudiated this deed 
as obtained unfairly, and proceedings were pending in 
Chancery as to its validity (&lt;/). 

Although, as will be seen, she was called as a witness 
and denied any agreement, before the deed, as to the 
amount of remuneration, or any mention of any particular 
sum prior to the deed, yet, as the jury found in favor of 
the plaintiff, it must be taken that the facts were as he

might be the reward it was to be after the result of the 
suit (a). 

At the close of the plaintiff&apos;s evidence, 

Macaulay,:(oT the defendant, proposed that he should 
not go to the jury on the plea of maintenance (ft), but 
that it should be reserved for the Court upon the facts, and 
he submitted that there was no case for the jury, as there 
was no evidence of any debt of which an account could be 
stated (c). 

CocKBURN, C. J. — There is evidence for the jury of an 
aciual accounting. Whether the substratum of the account 
was a debt, and can be maintained, is another question, 
and a question of law. I shall direct the jury, that, as far 
as the fees for counsel are concerned, there was no suffi- 
cient consideration. I have a very strong opinion that the 
fees of counsel constitute only an honorarium, and cannot 
be recovered at Iaw((/). There may be cases in which 
counsel could sue on contracts for their services (e), but 
this is not one of them. Under any circumstances {/) the 
point must be reserved ; the only question for the jury is,

There is no claim for the services originally rendered. The 1862. 
plaintiff&apos;s case is, that at the lady&apos;s request he undertook 
her case ; that from the commencement they were both 
aware of the risk ; that he knew she had not the means of 
remunerating him (a) unless she succeeded ; that she was 
willing, after she had succeeded, to make him a liberal 
remuneration ; that before the cause was finally won she 
stated the amount, and that afterwards she acknowledged 
the debt (i). 

All this is denied by the defendant, who, in particular, 
denies that she ever promised any amount. That is for 
you to determine. 

In this case you cannot take into consideration the 
services originally rendered. The claim is based on no 
such ground. The only claim is on the ground of an 
account stated. To prove that, it must be shown that 
the account has been admitted by the defendant. 

Whether your verdict, if for the plaintiff, can be upheld, 
is another question — a question of law, which is reserved 
for the Court, but on which I have a strong opinion, 
adverse to the plaintiff. 

Whatever he did as attorney of course falls to the 
ground. 

Whatever he did as counsel, I am bound to tell you 
cannot be the ground of an action at law. And this ap- 
plies to all that was done in the character of counsel, how- 
ever much it may have been in breach of professional 
etiquette. 

It has always been the rule of law that a barrister can- 
not bring an action to recover his fees (c). Emphatically

I say may it ever be so ! And if we wanted an illustration 
of the dreadful results which would follow the removal of 
that rule— fencing the honorable duties of the profession 
against temptations to dishonor— by preventing his reward 
from depending on the result of the suit, it would be 
impossible to find a more convincing one than we have 
seen to-day.

bad found for the defendant, the 
question of law could not have 
arisen ; and, further, as the Judge 
could not direei a verdict on the 
special pleas (ut ftipra), probablj 
the jury took the direction to mean 
that they were to determine whether 
there had been an accounting or 
admission of the demand in point 
of/act, the question as to whether 
there was any demand of which an 
account could be stated being re- 
served as one of law, beamte de- 
pending on a question of public 
policy, which, as the above case 
shows, is always for the Court. 

(a) Macauiay got a rule in Easter 
Term, but not, of course, for misdi- 
rection on the main question. 

That the control of the conduct 
of counsel, in the conduct of suits, 
is a matter of public policy (quite 
apart from any question, either of 
maintenance or champerty), seems 
clear, because all that relates to 
the administration gfjuttiee is so. 
&quot;The institution of the Bar is 
principally to a$$ist the Court in 
dispensing justice&quot; (per ALDsasoN, 
B., Moicatti ▼. Lawion, 1 Moo.&amp;Rob. 455) ; and so learned Judges 
have always upheld, and constantly 
act upon the principle that the Bar 
are bound to keep themselves inde- 
pendent, in order the better to be 
able to assist in the administration 



of justice. Hence it is that all 
their powers and privileges arise. 
With a view to the adminittratian 
of juUieCy counsel are privileged;

not allowed to sue for their fees 
( AfoiTM V. Hunt, 1 ChiL Rep. 504), 
** in order that no temptation may 
induce them to endeavour to get a 
verdict which, in their consdenoes, 
they think they are not entitled to.*&apos; 
&quot; It is for the purpose of prunoting 
the honour and integrity of the Bar, 
that it is expected that their fees 
should be paid, and that their com- 
pensation shall be equally the same 
whether the event be snecessfbl or 
unsuccessful.&apos;* &quot;There is nothing 
which has so great a tendency to

One Smith had been the tenant of Stafford Farm, on 
which there was a mill, with a house adjoining it, in which 
his bailiff had lived. He himself had not been in occupa- 
tion, and had allowed the defendant, who had acted as a 
sort of steward, to use the mill and three fields of grasi 
adjoining it, and also to occupy a few rooms in the house, 
the&amp;ai7t^ still residing there. 

On the 16th December, 1861, Smith agreed to let the 
defendant the fields in question, mentioned in the first 
count, for the remainder of his own term, and being in- 
debted to the defendant, gave him a receipt for rent of the 
*^mill and premises he now occupies^* up to Lady-day 
next. 

On the 18th December, 1861, Smith entered into the 
agreement with the plaintiffs mentioned in the second 
count, i. e. to sell him the crops and tillages at a valua- 
tion (a), agreeing orally to let him have possession of the 
farm for the purpose of cultivating and reaping the crops. 

The valuation was made in the usual way, the plaintiff 
going over the farm with Smith and the valuers, and 
claiming the fields in question, which defendant also 
claimed, and refused to give up. The plaintiff paid the 
valuation. Plaintiff said, that Smith said ** I give you

September, 1861, the following meinorandum was signed 1862. 
by the parties. 

** In re Stafford Farm, Mr. Bond wishing to have the 
grass-land adjoining the water and also the field of eight 
acres [one of those mentioned in the declaration], Mr. 
Edwards will not molest him in the same; Mr. Bond 
giving quiet possession of the farm*&apos; [and house]. The 
latter words had, it was contended, been added by the 
plaintiff (and the jury found against him as to that), and 
the defendant retained the fields and also the house. The 
plaintiff had exercised various acts of ownership on the 
farm, and attempted to do so in the fields in question, but 
had been resisted, and he had not entered the house, but 
the bailiff appeared to have acknowledged him. 

In January, the plaintiff brought ejectment for the house 
and lands in question, but soon afterwards discontinued 
that action (a) and brought the present one, suing, it will 
be seen, in trespass, and also on the agreement. 

It did not appear what was the duration of Smith&apos;s 
tenancy, but it was taken that it was subsisting. 

The case for the defendant was, that he was lessee of 
mill, house and fields adjoining thereto. 

The case for the plaintiff was, that he had been put in 
possession of the entire farm, and that if the defendant had 

(a) Doubtless, because there was entry, the lessee does not &apos;become 

no legal estate or title in the plain- tenant, so as to enable the landlord

agreementy but that he had no prior right, and that it was 
only by the agreement he had acquired a right to the 
eight acre field, which the plaintiff&apos; thereby consented to 
give up ta him. 

Smith was called for the plaintiff; and confirmed his 
case ; and stated that the plaintiff* wanted, and he agreed 
that he should have, the whole farm, but that the defend- 
ant was in possession of the mill; and as to the house, all 
he could say was, that he had let him occupy a few rooms 
there, for which it did not appear that any rent had been 
paid previous to the receipt referred to. 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury).~Did Smith let to the de- 
fendant the whole of the house and the fields in question. 
The case for the defendant is, that he did. If so, did the 
defendant agree to give up any or what part of the pre- 
mises in dispute ? 

The case for the plaintiff* is, that he was put in posses- 
sion of the whole farm except the mill. The miller or 
bailiff* was in occupation of part. Was he the plaintiff&apos;s 
agent or bailiff? If the defendant was entitled to and 
in possession of part of the house, then he would be 
entitled to a verdict as to part (a).

In March, 1851, the plaintiff became tenant of the farm 
under the demise by indenture, which being only for a 
year, he became tenant from year to year on the terms of 
that demise. 

In 1854, he took the underwood of a wood called Buck- 
ney Wood, adjoining his farm, and separated from it merely 
by ordinary hedges and fences. 

In March, 1855, the landlords by memorandum in writ- 
ing, not under seal (a), agreed to let to the plaintiff the 
right of shooting on the farm and wood for that year, on 
receiving from him 25/., and he agreed to take the shoot- 
ing (&amp;) on those terms. At the same time the plaintiff 
entered into a written agreement (a) with one of the de- 
fendants (Edward Green), that the latter should have the 
shooting (i) for a year, until Lady-day, 1856, employing 
the plaintiff to look afler it for him, and agreeing to pay 
him for game and rabbits hilled at a certain rate specified, 
in a sort of schedule set forth, in which the rate to be paid 
for the first hundred of i-abbits was 6d. a head, for the 
second hundred 9d. a head ; pheasants,&amp;c. being provided 
for in a similar way» as that the total estimated amount as 
specified came to about 40/. (c). 

At the expiration of the year, under this agreement, the 
defendant Green complained that he had not enough game 
or rabbits, and did not renew it, but agreed to pay the 
plaintiff 25/. per annum for the shooting on the farm and 
wood, and engaged one Vigis as gamekeeper. Shortly 
afterwards the defendant Green was joined in the shooting

by his son, and also by one CoUyer, the landlord&apos;s son 
(the other defendants), and the three formed a abooting 
fund, out of which thenceforth all expenses were paid. 

There was a deposition by Vigis, taken when in hifi last 
illness, to the effect, that by the directions of Green and 
Collyer he had, in the first year of his service, i. e. before 
March, 1867, obtained and turned on to the farm or wood 
some hundreds of rabbits, and that the former paid him 
money for the purpose. The other two defendants did not 
join in the shooting fund until about the latter time ; but 
there was slight evidence that, prior to then, they had 
occasionally joined in the shooting, and that they had 
actually on one or two occasions been present when 
rabbits had been obtained or turned on, or directed to .be 
obtained. The deposition of Vigis was confirmed by the 
evidence of his widow and son, who spoke to sums received 
by Vigis for the procuring of rabbits. And other witnesses 
spoke to a great increase of rabbits after Vigis eame. It 
appeared that most of the rabbits were put into Bockney 
Wood, which being of a wet, clayey soil, they would not 
burrow there, and burrowed in the hedges all around it, 
and that the damage to the farm was chiefly in the vicinity 
of the wood. There was also evidence that, in 1867 and 
1868, the plaintiff complained of the damage they did, and 
that it was intimated to him that if he could not agree with 
the defendants he must quit The result was that in 
Michaelmas, 1868, he received notice to quit at Michael- 
mas, 1859, and did so; previously to which, in April, 1869, 
he made a claim for compensation to the amount of above 
600Z. for damage done by the rabbits in 1856, 1867 and 
1868 ; and also a claim of 12/. for damage done by the 
defendants to a field of clover while beating there for 
game in September, the value of the crop being stated at 
30/., and the sum realized for it only 18/. The plaintiff, 
however, was present at the time of the occurrence, and 
did not object. The present action was not brought until

February, I86I9 the alleged reason for the delay being, 
that the plaintiff had not until then obtained the evidence 
of Vigis, and so was not in a position to prove that rabbits 
had been turned on to the farm. 

The case for the defendants consisted in an entire denial 
of any authority to Vigis to turn rabbits on to the farm, 
and of any knowledge that they had been so turned on. 
And as to the clover field, they alleged that they had done 
no more than the ordinary and necessary damage. 

The case had been tried here at the last Summer Assizes, 
before Williams, J., who told the jury, as to the alleged 
trespass in the clover field, that the defendants had no 
right to do damage to the standing crops ; and as to the 
turning on the rabbits, his Lordship left to them two 
questions — 1. Whether any were turned on with the ex- 
press or implied directions of the defendants (if not, he 
said, they were entitled to the verdict); and, 2ndly. 
Whether rabbits were so turned on to an unreasonable 
extent, looking to the terms of the grant or reservation. 
The learned Judge added, that there was no evidence of 
leave and licence. The jury were discharged, being unable 
to agree. 

On the present occasion, 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — As to the alleged trespass to 
the clover field, there is not any dispute as to the facts, 
except as to the amount of damage; and the question 
turns on the conflicting rights of the sportsman to his 
game, and of the farmer to his crops, a question &apos; which 
you must determine by the light of your practical expe- 
rience, as it is hardly capable of legal definition, except 
thus far, that the defendants had no right to do unnecessary 
damage ; that is, they were only justified in the exercise 
of their privilege, in the usual manner, and with the care 
usually taken by sportsmen in regard to standing crops ; and 
it is for you to say whether, if you are satisfied that the 
amount of damage was as stated, such an exercise of the

CASES ON THE 



1662. 




right could be usual, reasonable, or necessary, or such as tbe 
farmer could have contemplated when giving tbe right to 
shoot. If not, then the determination of value will be a 
good definite measure of damage. 

As regards the alleged leave and licence, no doubt tbe 
plaintiff, being present and silent, standing by and not 
objecting, would be evidence of such licence ; but on tbe 
other hand, you must consider whether a person in his 
position, a tenant from year to year, might not have been 
deterred from objecting by a dread of offending his land- 
lord, the sportsmen being his landlord&apos;s friends, and one 
of them his landlord&apos;s son. 

Then as to the rabbits, observe, that the defendants can 
only be liable for rabbits turned on, or for the growth and 
progress of rabbits turned on, and not for the mere natural 
increase of rabbits already on the farm ; for it is no ground 
of action that rabbits are not destroyed. The ground of 
action is the turning on rabbits ; and the defendants can 
only be liable for rabbits turned on with their express or 
implied authority, or with their sanction and approbation, 
or for the increase of rabbits so turned on. And tbe de- 
fendants can only be jointly liable for rabbits turned on 
with the sanction of all of them ; and you cannot, in this 
action, find against them for damage done by some rabbits 
turned on by orders of one of them, and by other rabbits 
turned on by orders of another of them (a). 

Then again, you can only in this action find against the 
defendants for damage done by rabbits turned on to the 
famif not as to rabbits turned into Buckney Wood, which 
was no part of the plaintiff&apos;s holding (&amp;). For if rabbits

the defendants would not be liable for the injury they 
caused (a). But as regards rabbits turned on to the /arm 
by the direction of the defendants, they would be liable, 
because the leave to shoot on the farm implied no right to 
put rabbits into the farm. That hundreds of rabbits 
were turned on to the farm there can be no doubt. The 
question is, whether they were so turned on with the sanc- 
tion and authority of the defendants.

THE QUEEN v. EAGLE. 

JxLURDER. The prisoner, a tall and very powerful 
man, had met the deceased, an old umbrella seller (to 
whom he did not appear to have been known), idling 
about a public house. The prisoner took hold of one of 
his umbrellas and asked what it would be, and the de- 
ceased said a shilling. The prisoner said he would give 
fourpence for it; and thereupon some idle talk took place, 
which was not given very fully by the witnesses, but in 
which some of the expressions seemed to show that the 
deceased was annoyed at the trifling value set on the um- 
brella, and the prisoner annoyed at some remarks of the 
deceased. It appeared that they twitted or taunted each 
other as to their having been soldiers, the deceased saying 
that he had been in the army, and the prisoner saying, in 
answer, that he also had been so. The deceased was 
going away, when he tripped ; and though the witnesses

did Dot see the prisoner put out bis foot to trip him up, it 
appeared that he had done so, for that the deceased angrily 
said that if he did that again he would knock him down, 
or something to that effect The deceased then was again 
going away, when he again tripped, and, as would appear, 
from the same cause (a). Thereupon the deceased turned 
round, and struck the prisoner as hard as he could upon 
the head with an old umbrella, the handle of which (not 
very strong) was broken with the blows. The prisoner 
said nothing while the blows were being given, nor was he 
seen to draw anything, nor was it seen whether he had 
a knife in his hand before; if not, he must then, or the 
instant afterwards, have drawn it out of his pocket and 
unclasped it, for immediately after he was seen to strike 
out at the deceased, and the latter staggered away, and 
was found to have sustained a wound in his stomach, in- 
flicted with such force, that the weapon went right through 
to the spine, severing an artery, and so causing death in a 
short time. The prisoner was found to have an open clasp 
knife in his hands, and a minute after said (showing it), 
*^ I have given him this.&quot; 

WooUett, for the prisoner, urged that it was a case of 
manslaughter. 

Erle, C. J. (to the jury). — The essence of the crime of 
murder is malice prepense (6), and the law implies malice 



(a) This repeated aggression on 
the part of the prisoner was not 
pressed at all on tlie part of the 
prosecution, and did not appear to 
be taken much notice of. 

(I) But it was left to the jury 
whether there was not malice pre* 
pense, and they were not told that, 
merely because of the blows, there 
was not such malice. Shortly be- 
fore these asaiias there had been 
dissatisfaction in the public 



mind in consequence &apos;of certain 
ptraons, charged with homicide, 
arising out of a sudden affray, hav- 
ing been acquitted of murder, and 
convicted only of manslaughter. It 
seemed to be supposed that the law 
had been laid down as if homicide, 
arising out of a sodden quarrel or 
affray, could not be murder; and 
there is not wanting tome sort of 
colour for that nodon, even in leamad 
works; as, for instance. Reeves*

where one has killed another by the use of a deadly 
weapon, unless the circumstances rebut the inference, and 

the taunter gives the fatal blow, 
the proverb, that &quot; it is the tecond 
blow which makes the affray,&quot; may 
apply, and the act may be only man- 
slaughter. The same reason would 



1862. 



Hist. Eng. Law, vol. 2, p. 537, 
where the learned author speaks of 
the act of killing, on a sadden 
quarrel, as one which could not, 
consistent with the feelings of the 
mind, as well as the dictates of 
plain sense, be stigmatised with the 
name of murder. Such a doctrine 
has never, however, been laid down 
by any Judge, and it would be 
dangerous if it ever were received. 
Beyond all doubt it has always 
been recognized that deadly malice 
may arise, out of a sudden provoca- 
tion, given to a person of malign 
and murderous disposition, and be 
shown in the use of a deadljf toeo&apos; 
pon, and that mere suddenness, 
though necessary to disprove malice 
prepense, does not per se prove it 
&quot; When one kills another volun- 
tarily, without any provocation,&quot; 
[i. e. as the context shows, without 
any legally sufficient,&apos;} *&apos;it is murder, 
for the law presumes it to be ma- 
licious ; it remains, therefore, to be 
inquired what is such a provocation 
as will take off the presumption of 
malice in him that kills another&quot; 
(1 Hale, P. C. 4M). And then 
Lord Hale gives instances, all of 
sudden quarrels, but in which it has 
been laid down, as matter of law, 
that mere words of slight or insult 
are not sufficient provocation to re- 
duce it to manslaughter ; but that 
any actual assault, or even menace 
of an instant assault (such as might 
sustain an action of assault), might 
be sufficient; and A fortiori, blows 
or beating. He also lays it down, 
that if, upon bare words of taunt, 
the party taunted strikes, and then 




apply, if, as in this case, the de- 
ceased were not only taunted, but 
actually tripped or lightly assaulted 
before he struck a blow, unless, 
indeed, there be evidence to show 
that the taunting or the tripping 
np, or the like, were &quot;deliberate 
artifice, thereby to take occasion to 
kill the other&quot; (Ibid. p. 456). Of 
this there was some reason for suf- 
picion in the present case, but no 
sufficient evidence of the intention. 
The case which caused discontent 
was one at the Central Criminal 
Court, coram Pollock, C B., and 
Martin, B., in which it was laid 
down, a sudden blow with a knife, 
by a drunken man, might be man- 
slaughter; in entire accordance with 
previous cases establishing that, 
&quot;although voluntary drunkenness 
cannot excuse from the commission 
of crime, yet when, as upon a 
charge of murder, the material 
question is, whether an act was 
premeditated or done only with 
sudden heat and impulse, the fact 
of the party being intoxicated has 
been held&apos; to be a circumstance 
proper to be taken into considera- 
tion;&quot; HoLROYD, J., Rexr, Grind&apos; 
ley, 1 Russ. C.&amp;M. 8; Parrs, 
B., Res V. Thomas, 7 C.&amp;P. 
817. The Imo certainly is, and 
is laid down as matter of law, 
that the killing of a person in 
an afiray by another who is in a 
violent heat and passion at the time, 



830 



CASES ON THE 



1862. 




reduce the offence to manslaaghter. The circumstanoet 
of the case do rebut the inference of malice, if they show 



and without any previoat malice, 
is not murder, but manslaughter 
(Rex V. RankiR^ IL&amp;R. C. C. 43); 
and that if, on a sudden quarrel, 
blows pass without any inlemtion to 
kill or injure any one maUrialljf, 
and in the course of the scuffle, 
after the parties are heated by the 
contest, one kill the other with a 
deadly weapon, it is only man- 
slaughter ; Rex ▼. Snow, 1 Leach, 
C.C. 151; 1 East, 244. But then 
it is equally the law, that it is not 
every iligkt protocation, even by a 
blow, which will, when the party 
receiving it strikes with a deadly 
weapon and death ensues, reduce 
the crime from murder to man- 
slaughter; Rex ▼. Lynch, 5 C.&amp;P. 324. And it is also the law, 
that it is a question for the jury, 
under the circumstances, whether 
it u murder or manslaughter (K. 
▼. Wiggt, 1 Leach, C. C. 379); 
i. e. whether the provocation was 
really such as did cause a violent 
heat and passion in the mind of 
him who struck the stroke, and 
whether the blow was struck under 
the influence of such heat and pas- 
sion, and without any deadly malice ; 
i. e. without any intention to kill or 
injure grievously. And this must 
depend upon the most minute cir- 
cumstances, which can only be 
matter of fact for the jury. Thus, 
though it has been laid down as 
matter of law, on matter of fact 
clearly proved, that if, after blows 
struck, one of the parties, on a tud- 
den and without any iuch intention 
at the commencement of the affray, 
snatches up a deadly weapon and 



kills the other party with it, aich 
killing will only amount to man* 
slaughter; Rex t. Anderwn, I 
Russ C.&amp;M. 447. But that very 
direction implied that it was a ques- 
tion ot/itct, as, of course, it must 
be, whether .there was or was not 
such intention. And so it was laid 
down as law, on the other hand, if 
a party, under colour of fighting 
upon equal terms, usetyhMi the 
beginning of the contest a deadly 
weapon without tha Inowledge of 
the other par^, whom he kills with 
such weapon ; or if at the begin- 
ning of the content he prepare a 
deadly weapon, so as to have the 
power of using it in some part of 
the contest, and accordingly does 
so and kills the other party; the 
killing in both these cases will be 
murder; Rex v. WhiUiey, Lew. C. 
C. 173. Here, again, it is equally 
implied, that it is matter of fact 
whether the weapon toat so pre- 
pared from, or at, the commence- 
ment of the afiray ; and also im- 
plied that the deliberate preparatioii 
of it at ally time, even in the course 
of the afiray, with the design of 
using it in a deadly way, would 
make the crime murder. And so, 
in the present case, if the prisoner 
had drawn the knife before the 
blows were struck, and while he 
was taunting or tripping up the 
deceased, there would have been 
clear and conclusive evidence of 
murder; but still it would have 
been only evidence, and the matter 
would have been for the juiy. It 
very rarely happens (if ever), in 
of this class, that the Judge

that the blow was given in the heat of passion, arising on 
a sudden provocation, and before the passion had time to 



can lay it down, as matter of law, 
that the act is murder. What evi- 
dence there teas, however, was lefl 
to the jury, in the general direction, 
to consider whether there was ma- 
lice prepense. And though the 
language of Lord Halr would ap- 
pear to imply, in the passage re- 
ferred to, that it was always a ques- 
tion of law, the modern cases clearly 
show that it is matter of fact for 
the jury where there is a sudden 
affray, and (he effect of the evi- 
dence is doubtful. In^the cases he 
cites the facts are stated as clear, 
and absence or presence of an in^ 
teni is stated. But where, as in 
most cases of this kind, that is the 
very point in doubt, it must be 
matter of fact. The law has been 
well settled, and has always been 
laid down as above by the Lord 
Chief Justice. An assault, though 
illegal, will not reduce the crime of 
the party killing the person assault- 
ing him to manslaughter, when the 
revenge U dUproportionate and har^ 
baraut; and that it is so may be 
matter of law, when it is clear it 
was revenge; Rex v. WiUoughby, 
1 Russ. C.&amp;M. 437 ; 1 East, P. C. 
288. So even blows previously re^ 
ceived will not extenuate homicide 
upon deliberate malice and revenge; 
especially where it is to be collected 
from the circumstances that the pro- 
vocation was sought for the purpose 
of colouring the revenge ; Rex v. 
Mason, 1 East, P. C. 239. But 
whether it was so or not must be 
matter of fact for the jury, whether 
they find a special or general ver- 
dict. In the case of killing by 



shooting or stabbing, all that is 
necessarily matter of law is, that, 
primdjacicj the act implies an in- 
tention to kill, and so is murder. 
But, even in a case of death by 
stabbing, it has been laid down, 
that *^ if the jury are of opinion 
that the wound was inflicted by 
the prisoner while smarting under 
a provocation, so recent and so 
strong that the prisoner may be 
considered as not being at the mo- 
ment the master of his own under- 
standing, the offence will be man- 
slaughter; but if there had been 
after the provocation sufficient time 
for the blood to cool, for reason to 
resume its seat before the mortal 
wound was given, the offence will 
amount to murder ; and if the pri- 
soner display thought, contrivance 
and design in the mode of possess- 
ing himself of the weapon, and in 
again replacing it immediately afler 
the blow was struck, such exercise 
of contrivance and design denotes 
rather the presence of judgment 
and reason than of violent and 
ungovernable passion ;&quot; Tindal, 
C. J., Rex V. Haywardf 6 C.&amp;P. 
157. But all these Are/acts to be 
found by the Jury, or proved be- 
yond any doubt or dispute, to enable 
the Judge so to lay down the law. 
It is always, in all cases, civil or cri- 
minal, matter of law whether there 
is any evidence of a legal ground of 
defence ; and as it may be matter 
of law that a blow is not sufficient 
to excuse homicide (and was so laid 
down in this very case vide supra), 
so it may be matter of law, that a 
blow is not sufficient to reduce the

cool. This you are to judge of. In the present cmse the 
quarrel was sudden ; the knife was a clasp knife, snch as 
might be naturally carried about the person, and was not 
fetched for the purpose ; and the deceased struck the first 
blow, and struck repeated blows. Those blows were not 
severe enough to excuse the use of a deadly weapon (espe- 
cially as the prisoner was so much the more powerful man, 
and had not used his natural weapons) ; but if they excited 
a passion, in the heat of which the prisoner gave the fatal 
blow, then you may find him guilty of manslaughter, a 
crime which greatly varies in intensity, and may come very 
nearly up to murder.

be matter of law that it may be to, 
tuppoung the jury find, as a matter 
of fact, that it did produce a pa»- 
sioD, which, as a matter of law,, it 
was legally sufficient to provoke. 
And so it has been laid down, that 
if A. kill B. under provocation of 
a blow not sufficiently violent in 
itself to render the killing man-

panied by very aggravating words

B., Reg, v. Sherwood, 1 Car.&amp;R. 
556. But it could hardly be laid 
down, as matter of law, that three 
violent blows were not enough to 
put a man in a passion, and reduce 
the crime to manslaughter. But, 
on the other hand, that it might be 
murder, and that whether it is so 
or not, is matter of fact for the 
jury, is implied in the Judge leav- 
ing the question to the jury, other- 
wise it would be biji duty to with* 



draw it from them, and tell them, as 
matter of law, either it is not mur- 
der, or U U murder. It would 
have been clearly murder if there 
had been clear evidence that, after 
taunts had passed^ the prisoner 
drew his knife, and, in order to 
provoke the deceased to strike bim, 
tripped him twice, with intent then 
to use his knife. But then all the 
facts, and e^teeiolfy the Uet, would 
have to he found by the jury, for 
although, deimded of aU drciim- 
stanoes, the bare fact of using a 
knife implies, fn law, an intent to 
kill, when the circumstances an 
shown, and die affiny turns out to 
be sudden, and the act after blows 
given, it must be a question of 
actual intent, and that ia always 
and neceuarUy matter oi/act for 
the jury. Therefore it was left to 
them by the Lord Chief Justice, and 
(as will be seen) in exact accord- 
ance with all the aotboritica.

particular whether she had been at Colchester on July

Philbrick objected that the statements were inadmis-

the same inducement, it being all part of the same pro- 
ceeding on the part of the police (&amp;). 

Erle, C. J., consulted Wightman, J., and intimated 
that his learned Brother and himself were of opinion, that 
though the former statement was inadmissible, there did

The prisoner*s statement was to the efiect that the fiither 
of the child (which was illegitimate) had written for it, and 
that she had sent it to him, at Ipswich, by a woman, at 
the railway station, Colchester. 

The only other evidence was, that she had been seen on 
the 4th of July going in a direction which might be towards 
the river or towards the station, with something which, to 
the witnesses, seemed like a child, of about the age of the 
missing infant (sixteen months), and that, on the next

you should be satisGed that the body found in the Colne 
was the body of the prisoner&apos;s child, and put there by her. 
It is most important, as laid down by Lord Hale, that on 
an indictment for murder it should be shown that the body 
found is the body of the murdered person (fr), as otherwise 
persons might be convicted for the murder of a person 
who was alive. It has been suggested, on behalf of the 
prisoner, that the child supposed to be murdered was sent 
away by her, and is, or may be, alive. That is not for her 
to prove, but for the prosecution to disprove. To disprove 
it, her answers to the questions of the police superinten- 
dent on the second occasion are relied upon. To put such 
questions without any caution was most improper, espe- 
cially since the prisoner does not seem to have been aware 
of their drift or object And an unmarried woman might 
naturally be reluctant to answer fully as to her illegitimate 
children. On the whole evidence, are you satisfied that 
the body found in the river was the body of the prisoner&apos;s 
child, and that it was put there by her ?

physical disorder of the system. Still, when the month&apos;s im-

his wife, it was doubted whether she ought to be sent home. 
However, she did so on the 14th of January, after spending

the day with her husband&apos;s parents. While there, they 
were reading the Bible together, and in making remarks 
on Christ&apos;s temptation, she said that she had been tempted 
by the devil sometimes to cut her husband&apos;s throat, or her 
own, and should do so very likely some day. They went 
home in the evening, and early next morning she roused 
her mother, telling her at first that some one had cut her 
husband all to pieces, and then that she had killed him ; 
and she subsequently said she had killed him with a chop- 
per as he lay asleep, and afterwards killed the child ; and 
that while she was doing it, she heard the devils blundering 
up and down the stairs, and making a dreadful noise, kc. 

Upon this evidence, without calling on the prisoner&apos;s 
counsel,

prisoner was in a state to know that she was doing what 
was wrong (a) ? There was morbid action of the brain :

(a) This case well illustrates a 
real, as contrasted with a colourable, 
defence, on the ground of insanity, 
and also, the proper evidence to 
sustain it. To establish a defence 
on the ground of insanity, it must 
be clearly proved, that, at the time 
of committing the act, the party 
accused was labouring under such 
a defect of reason, from disease of 
the mind, tu not to know the nature 
and quality of the act hewai doing, 
or Of not to know that what he was 
doing woM wrong; Macnaghten&apos;t 
case, 10 CI.&amp;Fin. 200. And again, 
in a later case, to entitle a pri- 
soner to be acquitted on the ground 
of insanity, he must, at the time of 
the committing of the offence, have 
been so insane that he did not know 
right from wrong ; Maule, J., Reg, 
T. Higginson, I Car.&amp;K. 1 29. If, 
to 1 charge of felony, the da- 



fence set up be insanity, the ques- 
tion for the jury will be, whether 
the prisoner was labouring under 
that species of insanity which satis- 
fied them that he mu quite unaware 
of the nature, character and come&apos; 
quences of ike act he was committing; 
or, in other words, whether he was 
under the influence of a diseased 
mind, and was really uncomcious, 
at the time he wag committing the 
act, that it wat a crime ; Reg. v. 
Ojford, 9 Car.&amp;P. 625-^per 
Demman, C. J., Alderson, B. and 
Pattebon, J. But the question is 
quite distinct, and is one of law for 
the Judge, whether there is suf- 
ficient evidence to leave to the jury 
to sustain the defence thus defined. 
And although in Macnaghten*t case 
it was laid down that, where an 
accused person is supposed to be 
insane, a medical man, who has

there waa a state of disease resulting from childbirth, 
and other causes, which might lead to insanity; and 

and must be taken on the account 
of the person accused. And there 
is not any case in which the de- 
fence has been sustained without 
some facts, however slight, capable 
ot proof, and showing insanity pro- 
bable. In the case of Mrs. Brough, 
tried at the Surrey Summer Aa- 
sizes, Guildford, 1854, ofram EaLS, 
C. J., for the murder of her chil- 
dren ( Bodkin and Ro6&lt;jmoji for the 
crown, James and Hawkint for the 
prisoner), tlie only evidence of ac- 
tual or probable insanity (L e. 
founded on facts prior to the act 
itself) was, that she had sustained 
some injury in the head, which, 
according to the medical eyidence, 
was such as might have led to in- 
sanity. But not only was there no 
evidence that it had, but all the 
evidence was the other way, inas- 
much as down to the time of the 
act she had been in charge of her 
household, and brought up her 
whole family, as far as appeared, 
quite sensibly. Upon this slender 
evidence, coupled with the circum- 
stances of the act (which of course 
can never be ejrchtded), and her 
irrational accounts of it, a theory 
of &quot; homicidal impulse&quot; was set up 
for the defence. In a very remark- 
able charge, the Lord Chief Justice 
condemned this theory, apart from 
evidence of real and actual insa- 
nity, and impressed upon the jury 
very forcibly, that persons, by the 
long indulgence of bad passions, 
might make themselves subject to 
homicidal impulses, which at last 
became, in a certain sense, irresis- 
tible, but which, so far from being 



been present in Court and heard 
the evidence, may be asked, as a 
matter of science, whether the facts 
stated by the witnesses, supposing 
them to be true, show a state of 
mind incapable of distinguishing 
between right and wrong, — this 
assumes that there are facts which 
the Judge deems sufficient so to 
leave to the jury, and also that the 
medical man is to give his opinion 
as on a matter of science, i. e. on 
matters within his proper cogni- 
zance as a medical man, and what 
they are this can well illustrate. 
The medical man, whether he 
speak as to facts he has himself ob- 
served, or as to facts stated by 
others, is to state his opinion, as a 
skilled witness, on the, facts; his 
opinion as to the probable state of 
the prisoner&apos;s mind at the time, 
founded on the facts; (Regina v. 
Richards, ante. Vol. I., p. 87.) 
Unless they are facts purely of 
medical cognizance, as the effect of 
exhaustion of vessels of the brain, 
as in the present case, it should seem 
that his opinion is not that of a 
skilled witness, and so not evi- 
dence ; unless he speak as a per- 
son skilled in the phenomena or 
symptoms of lunacy, from treat- 
ment of lunatics, and even then it 
seems, from the decisions of the 
House of Lords in Ferrer&apos;s ease 
and Macwighten*s case, it is for the 
jury to form their judgment on the 
opinions expressed on such phe- 
nomena or symptoms. The dan- 
ger of relying on merely mental 
phenomena, as delusions, or the 
like, is, that they may be simulated.

there were, before the act in question^ delusions of the 
unseSf which the medical men considery and might well 
consider, symptoms of insanity. She seems to have fancied 
she saw and heard devils, even when no one was in the 
house alive but herself. If so, that was a delusion of such 
a nature as to indicate insanity. Her killing her child at 
the same time was no doubt under the same influence. 
It is for you to say whether, upon such evidence, you 
consider she was in such a state as to know the nature of 
her actions, and to be aware that she was committing a

proper ground of excuse or defence, 
were at once the result, and the 
proof, of long continued depravity. 
As regarded the evidence of in- 
sanity — sh&apos;ght as it was — the Lord 
Chief Justice left it to the jury (of 
course defining insanity, in a legal 
sense, according to the authorities 
above quoted), with strong obser- 
vations on the medical evidence as 
to its probability. It was of course 
hardly possible to withdraw it from 
the jury (if it were practically pos- 
sible to do so), for in some cases 
the only mode of showing that there 
was actual insanity at the time is 
by showing physical or other causes, 
making it probable that it did so 
exist. But the remarks of the 
Lord Chief Justice, as to the un- 
satisfactory nature of such evidence, 
and the danger of acting on it, were 
well illustrated in the history and 
result of that case. The jury ac- 
quitted the prisoner on the ground 
of insanity, mainly, no doubt, on 
the supposed absence of any rational 
motive for the act. But after- 
wards, there was an action for 
adultery by the prisoner&apos;s husband, 
in which he recovered damages, 



and it was stated at the time, that 
the husband&apos;s ditcovery of the 
adultery, and threat of expulsion, 
had excited the unfortunate woman 
to the murder of her children in a 
paroxysm of revenge. So in a 
later case ( R. v. Haynetf ante^ Wq\, 
I., p. 606) the theory of homicidal 
impulse was condemned by BaAii- 
WELL, B. — ** The act, being appa- 
rently motiveless, is not a ground 
from which you can safely infer the 
existence of such an influence. 
Motives unknown may exist A 
morbid thirst for blood would itself 
be a motive urging to the deed.*&apos; 
In that case there wtrt no facts to 
show insanity, and the prisoner waa 
convicted. In a case before Black- 
BuaN, J., at the Surrey Summer 
Assizes, where a woman had got 
up from bed and cut her sister&apos;s 
throat, without any proved or appa^ 
rent motive, there was evidence of 
some injury to the head sustained 
in India, and some medical evi-» 
dence that it might suddenly give 
rise to insanity, and the learned 
Judge left the case to the jury as 
above, and the prisoner waa ac- 
quitted, on the ground of insanity.

1862. Ballaniuie, Serjt., and J7b// for ibe defendant. 

Id January, 1860, the defendant had given to a sdiool 
agent particulars in writing (lost, and not put in evidence), 
whence he had prepared and published in a school journal 
an advertitieroeot of the school, as to be disposed of, de- 
scnbing the number of boarders at twenty-two, and the land 
which could be let off at twenty-five acres. Premium 1502. 
Possession to be given at Lady-day next. Just before Lady- 
day, on the 17th March, the plaintiff entered into negotia- 
tions with the defendant and his agent, upon the basis of 
this advertisement. The negotiations continued during 
April and May, and the advertisement was kept standing 
all that time. The agent stated, however, that he had told 
the plaintiff that he must not depend on the advertisement 
as correct in all respects. But it did not appear that 
either the defendant or his agent had told tiie plaintiff 
what was the fact, that at Lady-day the number of boarders 
had fallen to seventeen. 

On the other hand, it did not appear that the plaintiff 
had asked the question whether the number of scholars re- 
mained the same. 

A prospectus was put into his hands which stated the 
number of acres to be let off at less than twenty-five, and 
the defendant said he had never measured the land, and 
did not know exactly how much there was. In point of 
fact there were only about twenty acres altogether. It 
did not appear, however, that on this point the plaintiff had 
made any particular inquiries. 

On the 24th of June, the plaintiff signed the agreement 
and paid the premium, which bad been reduced to HOL 
(for a reason which had no regard to the present question 
between the parties), and on that day he took possession. 

Only twelve scholars came back from the vacation. 

A return of part of the premium had been claimed and 
refused. 

A plaint had been brought in the County Court for 50^

and removed by certiorari. And the claim in the declare- 1862. 
tion was for 100/. 

WiGHTMAN, J. (to the jury).— There is no doubt the 
representations were false. But the plaintiff alleges that 
he was induced by these representations to enter into the 
contract. Was that so ? Possession was to be given at 
Lady-day^ and the representation must be taken as refer- 
ing to that time. Was he told that there were then only 
seventeen scholars? No doubt nothing can be more 
precarious than the good-will of a school, and the number 
of scholars must fluctuate, especially in prospect of a 
change. And there was no guarantee that the numbers 
should heep up to the number stated. The question is, 
was the number wilfully misstated by the defendant at 
Lady-day ? The advertisement, for all that appears, was 
true when he penned it. But it was kept standing, and 
the question is, first, whether he told the plaintiff that 
the number of scholars had fallen to seventeen, and next, 
whether the plaintiff made the contract on the belief that 
there were twenty-two? Of course he could not if he 
were told otherwise. Was he told otherwise? He was 
told not to rely on the advertisement as correct. Did he 
purchase on the faith of the representations made in it ? 

Verdict for the plaintiff, damages 140/. 

i9au?/a7W applied to amend the declaration by increasing 
the claim to 140/. 

iTb// opposed the application, on the ground that the 
original claim had been only for 60/., and further, that the

WiOHTMAN, J., said, if it were to be assailed on that 
ground he would make the amendment. If not, he did 
not feel disposecf to do so, looking at the original claim in 
the County Court.

It appeared that, in I SSO, Whitehall Road was madei 
before which there ran, somewhat in the same direction, a 
&apos;^ glade&quot; or opening, in the forest; but it was suggested, 
on the part of the defendant, that the glade run over the 
locuB in quo towards his house, which lay beyond the 
plaintiff&apos;s, towards Chingford. At the making of the road, 
however, a ditch had been dug (probably for drainage) on 
the locus in quo (a), on the side next to the road. Prior 
to 1830 the whole land was unenclosed, and the green had 
been an open space in the forest, void of trees and covered 
with furze, of which, in course of time, it had been cleared, 
still remaining unenclosed. There was evidence — nor was 
it disputed — that people had always been used to go over 
the locus in quo, as over the rest of the forest, wherever 
they liked, and whenever they could ; but there was no 
distinct evidence of any definite way in any particular 
direction, and though there were *&apos; tracks,&quot; from time to 
time, which might last for a few weeks or months, there 
was no beaten or enduring track in any one direction, 
which had lasted for years. And it further appeared that 
the green, like the old forest glades (one of which it was 
suggested had gone across it), was in wet weather or 
winter impassable for travellers on foot, who would then 
be forced to go along the hard road, called Whitehall 
Road. 

Hawkins offered to prove that the inhabitants were used 
to play games on the green (ft), but

defence, and the evidence was not pressed.

as there were all over the forest, but no beaten, worn, or 
permanent track or footway. 

The witnesses for the defendant did not say that the 
supposed path was passable in wet weather, and even the 
defendant said he &quot; could not say that there was a defined 
path.&quot; 

Bovilt, in reply, urged that this kind of evidence 
would not establish rights in the public, or in the in* 
habitants of a place, as otherwise the owner&apos;s right of 
property would virtually be divested in all open unenclosed 
lands, over which the people were allowed to wander and 
ramble as they pleased, but that such evidence merely 
showed a species of permissive enjoyment (a). 

WiGHTMAN, J. (to the jury).-*The question is, whether 
there was a way over the spot where tlie hurdles were put 
up. In one sense there was a way there and everywhere, 
for it appears that the green was part of the ancient forest, 
and the effect of the evidence is, that people went wher- 
ever they liked. All the witnesses seem to concur in that, 
that everybody went wherever they pleased. And so, in 
that sense, the whole forest was one great way. But that 
is not the sense in which the word is used in the plea ; it 
must be taken in some more definite sense, or else the 
entire forest must be deemed to be a way. Was there any 
defined way, in any particular direction ? It has been 
attempted to prove that there was ; and it appears that, 
from, a certain point, the course of the alleged way would 
be the nearest course to Chingford. But it appears also

that though there were many tracks in diflerent directions, 1862. 
none of them were enduring; and that they would be impass- 
able in winter. Before Whitehall Road wad made persons 
would have to force their way through furze, and bushes, 
and swamps ; and it does not plainly appear where the 
alleged way would have led, or why it should have been 
used. Since Whitehall Road was made the supposed way 
seems to have been convenient, when passable, to avoid a 
comer, and save a slight distance in going to houses built 
since then. The question, then, on the first special plea 
is, whether there was a right of way on the spot where the 
hurdles were placed? If you think there, was no regular 
way there, but that people merely went where they liked, 
find for the plaintiiF. 

Then as to the alleged custom^ it is laid in the in- 
Jlabitants ; but the proof is wider than the plea, for it 
appears that all the world went wherever they pleased. 
It may be a question whether that would be a good custom 
in law ; and of course if, in point of fact, it is proved as to 
all the world, it is proved as to the inhabitants. On the 
other hand, if the plea be taken to mean that the right is 
only in the inhabitants, it is disproved, for the /^r^^q/* shows 
it to be, if it exist at all, in all the world. Supposing, 
however, that the plea only alleges that the inhabitants 
have the right, then was there such a custom as is laid ? 

As regards both pleas, observe that the question is, 
whether the alleged user was as of right ; for if they were 
merely permissive usages, the pleas are not sustained. 

The jury found that there was not a way, and that there 
was not a custom, as alleged.

A dying declaration of deceased cannot be admitted by the Judge merely from his own

the time, believed himse^ about to die), unless, at all events, it be shown to have been such 
as must neeeuarily have caused death in a short time, and such as all men reasonably must 
suppose to be so.

Erle^ C. J., thought the evidence inadmiBsible. 



1862. 



Roupell pressed that the nature of the wound itself was The Queen 
such as to show that the deceased must have been under cle^ary. 
the expectation of imminent death. 

Erle, C. J.y said he could not, in the absence of evi- 
dence, presume that a man who had been shot through 
the body must necessarily feel that he was about to die (a). 

The declaration of the deceased was therefore rejected. 

[It was, that the man who shot him was a soldier.] 

Roupell then proposed to put in the deposition made by 
Bedford before the coroner (he having since died), the 
deposition containing some stronger evidence that the 
deceased was in expectation of immediate death. 



(a) Because the question is, in 
such a case, whether the declara- 
tion was made by the deceased 
under an Impression on h&apos;u mind 
of almost intmediate dissolution; 
and it is not enough even that he 
should have thought that he should 
ultimately never recover. Rex v. 
Van Butchell, 3 C.&amp;P.629— Hul- 
LocK and Littledale. And this 
depends, of course, chiefly on what 
the deceased utid respecting the 
danger in which be eomidertd him^ 
telf to be; and it will, vpon ihis, be 
for the Judge to decide whether 
the deceased then had that impres- 
■ion on his mind which would ren- 
der his declaration admissible. Rex 
V. John, 1 East, P. C. 357 ; S. P., 
Rex V. Wellboum, 1 East, P. C. 
358; 5. P., Rex v. Htukt, I 
Stark. 523. And though it .is no 
doubt true that the apprehension 
of danger may appear either from 
the express declaration of the de- 
ceased at the time, or may be in- 
Jtrredjrom ihe $tate of the vsound,

or illness, or other circumstances 
indicating the same ; Rex v. John^ 
1 East, ?. C. 357 ; yet, as, if the 
deceased had been told that his 
recovery was just possible, and that 
his wound was not necewirily mor- 
tal, and that there had been an 
instance where a person had re- 
covered after such a wound, he 
after this had made a statement, it 
has been held that it would not be 
admissible as a declaration in or- 
t&apos;tculo moriiSf for the deceased, being 
told that the wound was not necet- 
iarily mortal, might still have a 
hope of recovery ; Rex v. Chriuiej 
Car. C. L. 232— A bbott and Park ; 
so, as the Judge, here, could not put 
the case as worse than that, or, on 
the evidence, presume that the de- 
ceased, at the time, thought it was 
worse, or that he had not such a 
hope o/&apos;pouible recovery, the decla- 
ration was not more admissible than 
if the deceased had been actually 
told as much as in the case cited.

he left tbe barracks, and there was strong evidence that ^ «- 

he had taken a rifle and ammunition with him. In about 

balf an hour a shot was beard near tbe college, and some 

one, by the light of the flash, saw a man dressed in what 

seemed a soldier&apos;s great-K:oat and cap running away (a). 

There was no other evidence as to who fired the shot, but 

the theory of the prosecution was, that it was an attempt 

by the prisoner to shoot one of his officers (a). There 

was no evidence, however, of any of them having been 

walking near the spot at the time. He had not returned 

to barracks, and a man, described as dressed like him, in a 

soldier&apos;s coat and cap, with a musket, had been seen by 

more than one witness next night, near the place where 

the deceased was shot, standing under the hedge. And 

this man was so seen there just before the shot was fired. 

Not far ofi* from the spot the prisoner&apos;s rifle was found, 

loaded, laid down half covered up under a hedge. The 

prisoner was seen next day, the 17th, three or four miles 

oiF, without his rifle. And when arrested on that day he 

was at some distance from Chichester, going towards 

Petworth. He ran away when he saw the officer, and 

said he was a deserter, and had left Chichester two days 

ago. When told of the murder, he said, &quot; I had nothing 

to do it with.&quot; When told that there had been a rifle 

found, he said, &quot; How do they know it was taken out of 

the barracks ? Have they found one ?&quot; When told that 

it had been found, he said, ** It is not mine.&quot; After his

J^^^^^^&quot;^ occasion said he doubted not the major would hang him if 
V, he couldy and that he hoped the major would have him 

drummed out. He also said that the major had been shot 
at twice before in China, and that he knew who did it. 
It came out that several soldiers were out of barracks the 
night before the murder, but on the night of the murder it 
did not appear that any other soldier than the prisoner 
was out, or that more than one rifle was missing. There 
was, however, no evidence that the major or any other 
oflScer would be likely to be in the lane about the time of 
the shot, or that any of them had been there. 

At the close of the case, 

Ehle, C. J. (to the jury).— There are two questions for 
you: — First, was the deceased murdered? Secondly, was 
he murdered by the prisoner? On the first question there 
can be little doubt, for if the shot was fired by accident, 
and with no intent to kill ant/ one, the person who fired it, 
and who must have heard the shriek uttered by the de- 
ceased, would have gone to his assistance. It is plain that 
whoever fired the shot meant to kill some one, and to leave 
his victim to die (a). Then the second question arises, was 
the prisoner the person who fired the shot (a) ? Now there 
is no express evidence that he was, and it is only to be 
inferred from circumstances. Partly from the evidence of 
identity ; partly from the suggested motive or intent of the 
prisoner to kill some other person. As to the evidence of 
identity, it is doubtful and slight, and no one speaks clearly 
to having seen the prisoner near the spot at the time, but 
only to a person dressed like him, i.e. in the common dress 
of a soldier. It is true that one or two speak to having 
seen a man dressed like a soldier, and with a gun. And if 

(a) This the Lord Chief Justice matter at whom, he was guiltj of

HOME CIRCUIT. 865 

you are -satisfied that the prisoner took a gun with him, 1862. 
then that would bear strongly against him, not only as to 
the identity, but as to the falsity of the statement he made 
that he had not a gun with him, and also as to the Jinding 
of a gun near the spot in the way he took. But even 
assuming that he had a gun, that would not be coitclusive 
that he was the man who fired the fatal shot. It is sug- 
gested that it is to be inferred that he was so from the fact 
that he had uttered angry words or threats against any one 
who had to do with his being ordered to drill next day. 
But there is no evidence that he had found out who had 
had to do with it, or that he had conceived enmity against 
any particular person, or that any person against whom he 
might be supposed to have an enmity was or would be 
likely to be at the spot at or about the time of the fatal 
shot. The angry words have a double bearing; they go 
against the prisoner if they could be taken as denoting 
enmity against any particular person; but they arc rather 
perhaps in his favour in this view, that they denote a design 
to desert. The question comes to this : on the whole of 
the evidence, are you satisfied that Jie fired that shot? That 
is, fired it intentionally (a), for the theory of accidental 
firing seems (for the reason I have given) untenable. 

Verdict, not guilty (a). 

(a) A verdict which met the ap- the gun fired, and he was the man 

proval of all lawyers, although who fired (which no doubt may be 

great doubt and dissatisfaction was taken as facts, in substance the 

expressed among laymen. It was same) must depend, as the Lord 

said that there was no moral doubt Chief Justice pointed out, partly on 

of the man&apos;s guilt. Nor was there, evidence of identity, which was 

if all the facts were taken as clearly doubtful, and partly on the assumed 

proved, on which the theory of the or suggested theory of motive and 

prosecution was based. But then intent, as to which, not only was 

the great fact it required, that the there doubt, but there was an utter 

prisoner had Jired the ihot, was not blank and defect in the evidence ; 

clearly proved ; even assuming that for it was not proyed that any 

it was proved that he took a gun officer who had had to do with the

gnpposed to have had to do with it 
(Major Bush, for instance), was or 
would be likely to be on the spot 
at the time the shot was fired. 
The case for the prosecution went 
upon the theory that one man had 
been shot by mistake for another, 
and the evidence of identity was 
so doubtful, that though, if it had 
been clearly proved that the pri- 
soner had fired the shot wilfully at 
any one, it would not have mat- 
tered whether he fired at the de- 
ceased; yet, as the evidence of 
identity was so doubtful, and it was 
sought to eke it out by a presump- 
tion that the prisoner was the man 
who fired the shot, beeause he had 
a design to shoot some ottCy it was 
essential to prove that the man 
whom he meant to shoot was or 
might be supposed to have been on 
the spot, otherwise, it is obvious 
there could be no greater reason to 
presume that the prisoner had fired 
this shot than any olher shot, or that 
the prisoner had fired it rather than 
any other person. The verdict was 
supposed to have- gone on the 
notion, that if one man is shot by 
mistake for another, it is not mur- 
der! a notion quite contrary to the 
clear meaning of the charge, and 
probably to the common knowledge 
of all men. But the verdict went 
upon this, that if the main proof or 
main part of the proof, that the 
prisoner fired the shot, is, that he 
meant to kill some one else (which, 
per se, rather negatives the idea 
that he did so,) it must at least be 



clearly proved, that the penoa 
whom he meant to shoot was on the 
spot, or might have been supposed 
to be so. This was not only not 
proved, but there was no evidence 
of it, so that the case broke down 
on what turned out to be its vital 
point. For, striking that out, the 
case for the prosecution, even aa- 
suming an intent to kill an officer, 
and even assuming an attempt to 
do so, on the part of the prisoner, 
was quite consistent with the theory 
that he had abandoned the attempt, 
laid aside the gun, and gone away, 
and that some other person had 
fired the shot, either against the 
deceased or some one ebe. The 
only person who spoke to the 
personal identity of the prisoner, aa 
distinguished from the mere com- 
mon likeness of a soldier&apos;s dress, 
saw him three or four miles off and 
without a gun. The case for the 
prosecution, therefore, did not bring 
itself within the definition of good 
presumptive proof, vix,^ proof leav- 
ing place for any rational tbeoiy 
of innocence. And the case, as 
reported, as a useful illustration 
of the doctrine of presumptive 
proof, aa an instructive instance of a 
case defective in evidence, and aa a 
comment or limitation on the legal 
rule that evidence of a particular 
intent is not necessary in bomicade 
(as it is not in the alntrmot or 
always, but is, it will be seen, 
practically, in some cases), as well 
as for the collateral pointa of evi- 
dence decided.

^ spring AtHz€t^ 

J. HE prisoner, a station-master of the Brighton Railway Although man- 

Corapany, was indicted for the manslaughter of divers per- be imaiiftoinS 

sons killed in consequence of a collision between two trains 1^^^ ^^^ . 

in the Clayton Tunnel. The representatives of the persons result of the 

killed &quot;had brought actions against the company, under ^ence of the 

Lord Campbell&apos;s Act, for compensation, and in all of them oihe«ryeHt 

the company had paid money into Court, and so admitted must have been 

the negligence on the part of their servants. The prisoner suit, wholly or 

was a porter at the Brighton Station, and it was his duty ^^j^mer** 

on the day in question to start the trains. It being an nfi?l&gt;gcnce,and 

excursion day, three up-trains came in succession, all of must have been 

them late, so that none of them could be started at the part the protu 

proper time. There was a rule of the company that under ^&apos;&apos;^&quot;cauge 

such circumstances no train should be started at intervals of the death,&lt;•! 1 /. . ft 1^ 1- mi anditisnotso 

of less than five mmutes after the preceding one. The case where the neg- 
for the prosecution was, that the prisoner had started the o^^enon^^ 
trains so that there was only an interval of three or four 5&quot; mtenrened 

■^ ^ between Am act 

minutes between the second and third. The first train oromissionand 
arrived safely at the Clayton Tunnel (seven miles from 
Brighton), and passed through safely, and the man at the 
south or Brighton end of the tunnel, when it entered, 
telegraphed &apos;&apos; train in,&quot; but owing to some improper work- 
ing of the signal at his end, became confused, and on the 
arrival of the second train, not feeling certain that he had 
received the signal which authorized him to send on the 
second train, again telegraphed &apos;&apos; train in,&quot; just as the 
second train had gone into the tunnel. Fearing that the 
signal might be misunderstood, and that mischief might 
ensue, he showed the red flag, which he imagined the 
second train had not seen, but which had the efibct of 
pulling up the second train in the tunnel. He again tele- 
graphed to ask, &apos;&apos; Is that train out?&quot; upon which the man 
at the north end of the tunnel, supposing that this referred

CASES ON THE

to the first train, telegraphed, &quot; train out,&quot; whereupon the 
porter at the south end of the tunnel, imagining that ali 
was clear, sent the third train into the tunnel, and this ran 
into the second, which had come to a standstill in conse- 
quence of seeing the red flag, the danger signal. 

The grand jury had thrown out the bill against the 
prisoner, in accordance with the opinion expressed by the 
Lord Chief Justice in his charge (a). 



(a) His Lordship said the grand 
jury mast be satisfied, before they 
found the bill, that there was a 
prm&amp;facie case of such criminal 
negligence as had been the proid- 
mate and efficient cause of the 
catastrophe. The negligence im- 
puted appeared to be the tending 
on one train after another in a 
shorter interval of time than, ac* 
cording to the rules, he ought to 
have done. There had been, how- 
ever, some mistake on the part of 
other of the company&apos;s servants in 
regard to the signals. A mistake, 
indeed, was said to have arisen 
from the negligence of the defend- 
ant. Still, if the particular negli- 
gence imputed to the prisoner ap- 
peared not to have been the proxi- 
mate and efficient cause of the ca- 
tastrophe, the bill for manslaughter 
ought not to be found ,* and if it 
appeared that other causes had in- 
tervened, the prisoner&apos;s negligence 
would not have been the proximate 
and efficient cause of the deaths 
which had occurred. That this was 
in entire accordance with the au- 
thorities will appear from the most 
recent cases. The case is to be 
clearly distinguished from that of 
joint negligence. It is, indeed, 
well settled that it is no defence in 
a case of manslaughter that the 



death of the deceased was caused 
by the negligence of othen as welt 
as by that of the prisoner ; for if 
the death of a deceased be caused 
partly by the negligence of the pri- 
soner and partly by the negligence 
of others, the prisoner and all those 
others are guilty of manslaughter ; 
per Maule, J., Reg, v. Haines, 2 
Car.&amp;K. 368. If it be the duty 
of a person, as a ground bailiff of a 
mine, to cause-the mine to be pro- 
perly ventilated by caonng air- 
headings to be put up where neces- 
sary, and by reason of his omission 
in this respect another be killed by 
an explosion of fire-damp, such 
personals guilty of manslaughter, 
if by such his omission he was 
guilty of a want of ordinary and 
reasonable precaution, and if it was 
his plain and ordinary duty to have 
caused an air-heading to have been 
made, and a man using reasonable 
diligence would have done it ; Ibid.

charge of an engine which was

Ballantine, Serjt., objected that she could not, without 
express authority, bind her husband in a criminal case. 

Erlb, C. J. — No doubt (a); but whether she had that 
authority must depend upon the whole of Uie evidence in 
the case, and be left with the main question for the jury. 

It appeared that the receipt in question was in the 
pri$oner*8 own writing. It purported to be the receipt of 
one Towne, to whom the prisoner&apos;s employer was indebted, 
and to whom the prisoner had professed to his employer 
to have paid it, by handing him the receipt. 

But it also appeared that, at the time, ft was doubtful

ARCENY. The Judge, in 

The prisoner had been arraigned and given in charge to Sa^o^amiKll^&apos;

J: .,, 11 adjournment . 

Lumley Smith, for the prosecution, had opened the case, (i.e.to«ito/A«r 
when it appeared that neither the prosecutor nor bis wit- coum of^e 
nesses were present. It was suggested that, as this was ^^^&apos;^^^ 
the second Crown Court formed at the close of the day, cutor and hit

having heard of the second Court, though the officer stated 
that he had given due notice of it in the first Court. 

Under these circumstances counsel applied for an

late to wait till the witnesses were sent for. (To the 
jury.) — ^There is no evidence against the prisoner, and as 
he has been given in charge to you, I cannot order an

will be discharged in due course of law.

(a) That is, until next day. The 
proper meaning of the word ad-

only cases to be found of so-called 
adjournment in cases of mere defect 
of evidence are cases of suspension 
of proceedings for a short time, the

WiGHTMAN, J., held it &quot;suflBcient description of the

Afterwards, 

Hawkins, in addressing the jury, urged that the address 
was not sufficient, on which 

WiGHTMAN, J., said : — I shall not leave that to the 
jury. It was a matter for me to determine, on putting in 
the bill of sale, and I have determined it (a). 

It appeared that the bill of sale was of all the assignor&apos;s 
effects, and that there had been no valuation. [It did not 
realize enough to satisfy the claimant, but it was suggested 
that some goods had been removed.] 

Hawkins, in going to the jury, urged that the object was 
not to protect the goods for the claimant, but against all 
creditors, and that therefore it was invalid. 

WiGUTMAN, J. (to the jury). — Was the object really to

Plea (a) : that there was of right a common and public 
highway over the said land for all persons to go and return, 
pass and repass, on foot, at all times of the year at their 
free will and pleasure ; wherefore the defendants, having

Issue. 

itf . Chambers^ Hawkins and Brown for the plaintiff. 

Shee^ Serjt., for the defendants. 

The onus being on the defendants on the above plea, 

SheCf Seijt, began, and the case on their behalf was, 
that the land originally was open, as part of Tunbridge 
Wood, and that Lord Camden had purchased it about 
twenty years ago, and had been since clearing and enclos- 
ing it, and had let portions of it on building leases, and 
had so let a portion to the plaintiff. That on the land as 
it originally existed there were divers ancient footways, 
which, though they had not been repaired, were public 
highways. And that the fence in question was erected 
across a road, which had been laid out, on the site of one 
of these ancient footways. It led to several other places 
and highways. 

Erle, C. J. — That is not material, the question being, 
whether it is itself a highway. 

Shee^ Serjt., said, as matter of evidence it might be 
material on that question. 

The witnesses for the defendants proved that in point of 
fact the alleged way led to other places and public foot- 
ways, and that it had itself been used as a footway for 
sixty years past. About thirty years ago it was cleared 
and grubbed up, and adjoining land, so cleared, was let 
to cottagers for allotments. About twenty years ago the 
carriage road was made on the site of this way, and it then 
was gravelled and hardened, and gates were set up at the 
ends. Before the carriage road was so made, a small 
stream ran along the way, and &apos;the footpath was on one 
side of it. The old footpath lay among the trees till the

and the defendants&apos; witnesses described it as &apos;*a way 
leading to the allotments.&quot; They said, indeed, it was 
always a footway^ but admitted tliat it was not pass- 
able at all times, but only in favourable weather (a). 
Moreover, it clearly appeared that the supposed way was 
in the wood, and the language the witnesses used was, 
they used to play there, and that people used to &quot; wander 
about the wood/&apos; and the like. It further appeared that 
for tlie last sixty or seventy years the wood had been in 
gradual process of clearance. The effect of the evidence 
seemed to be very much (in the language of one of the 
witnesses) that people used to go where they liked in the 
wood. Some of the witnesses said that there never was 
any made path, and it seemed to have been merely a track 
in the woods, passable only in dry weather, or at all 
events not easily passable in wet weather. In fact, one of 
the defendants&apos; witnesses said, ** it was a little track, about 
eighteen inches wide.&quot; There were other paths, or tracks, 
through the wood, all of the same kind. Another of the 
witnesses said it was a &apos;&apos; sort of blind path,&quot; and he had 
hot considered it as a public path. Another called it a 
&quot; blind track among the stubs.&quot; It was plain that there 
had never been any repairs of the old footway, and no 
attempt was made to prove that there had been. 

Chambers called witnesses on the part of the plaintiff, 
who proved that the wood had been where the way was 
claimed, and that since it was grubbed it had not been 
used as of right, or without interruption, but thaf rough 
characters&quot; were often turned back. They said, more- 
over, that the ** way &quot; was but a mere track, like many 
other tracks in the wood, and led nowhere but through 
the wood. Thirty years ago, when a building estate was

formed, called Camden Park, there was a roadway made, 
a lodge, and lodge-gates put up at one end, leading into 
the park, and since then the user bad been constantly 
interrupted by lodge-keepers. The person who had had 
charge of the estate for more than twenty years was called 
to prove this, with many other witnesses. 

In the course of this evidence, 

The jury intimated that they were satisfied there was no 
way. 

Shee^ Serjt, in reply, on the part of the defendants, 
urged that there was evidence of a dedication to the public 
of the old footway, and if so, then no amount of inter- 
ruption could deprive the public of their right over a 
highway. 

Erlb, C. J. (to the jury). — ^That is so, if there was once 
a highway. But the question is, whether there ever was 
a highway. There could not be without a dedication by 
the owner to the public for the purposes of a highway. 
No doubt user by the public may be evidence of such a 
dedication ; but then it is only evidence, to be considered 
with a view to the nature of the case, and all its circum- 
stances. There was a wood; this was a path or track 
through it, like many others, leading in different direc- 
tions. People wandered wherever they pleased in the 
wood, and of course made tracks, and when the weather 
was dry used these tracks. But they were never repaired, 
and in wet weather were hardly passable. Are you of 
opinion that there was a dedication by the owner to the 
public for the purposes of a highway, or that the user was 
merely permissive, to wander where they pleased in the 
wood 7 If there was no dedication for the purpose of a 
highway, find for the plaintiff. 

Verdict for the plaintiff.

allowed at the trial, so as to get rid of the demurrer, and also to evade a variance 
arising on the evidence of the party applying to amend. Farrer v. Corft, 336. 

APPRENTICE, discharge of, justification for, plea of, allowed to be amended at 
trial. If an apprentice, whose master&apos;s business lies in precious articles constantly 
lying about, is an habitual thief, the master may discbarge him ; and charges of 
theft made to his father will be privileged, but the master will be liable in slander 
for false charges made to third parties. Cox v. Muthewn^ 397. 

absenting by, action for. In an action on an apprenticeship deed, against the father, 
the breach being that the son absented himself, the plaintiff can only recover da- 
• mage for the loss of service up to the time of action. And the action is not for an 
alleged wrong within the C. L. P. Act of 1860| s. 34, as to costs. Btrri v. How- 
ard, 403. 

when an apprentice has absented himself, the fact that the master declined to have 
any trouble taken to find him and described him as worthless, though it will not 
sustain a plea of leave and licence, may be material in mitigation of damages, and 
the jury can only give the real value of his services up to the time of action. 
Russell v. Shinn, 395. 

APPROPRIATION, evidence of, assent to transfer of debt. Burland v. Nash, 687. 

ARBITRATION, reference or submission to; compulsory reference to. An action 
for non-repair, the only plea being payment into Court, and the only question as 
to the sufficiency of the amount, turning merely on the facts, is fit for reference to 
arbitration under C. L. P. Act, 1854. s. 3 Pell v. Addison, 291 (a), 
may be at Nisi Prius. There may be a reference of a cause or of matter of account 
thereon by the Judge at the trial, on the application of either party, under sect. 3 
of the C. L. P. Act of 1854, and this, although the ** matter of account&apos;* is not be- 
tween the plaintiff and defendant, but between one of the parties to the cause and 
a third party, provided it is by plea, or otherwise mixed up with the cause of 
action or defence. Adams v. Yeoman^ 92 (6).

chequer ; but as to the power to refer at tiisi prius, vide pmu

the preceding case. Pelt v. Addison, decided by Willfs, J., so that though the Kxchequer

in litigation in Chancery, held not liable for the acts of a person acting as her

but not her general attorney, and without her privity or actual authority in the 
particular matter. Oxenkam v. Collim, 1 72.

the part of the owner, and contrary to an agreement, he supposed he had authority

liability of, to action for negligence. In an action against an attorney, alleging that 
he was retained to conduct the defence of the plaintiff on a criminal charge, and 
that through his negligence the plaintiff was convicted (not alleging that he was 
innocent) : — Held, that the plaintiff, to recover more than nominal damages, must 
prove that he was convicted mainly through the defendant&apos;s negligence, and the 
negligence charged being, not taking the proofs of witnesses who were in Court 
ready to be examined, but whom the counsel, on the plaintiff&apos;s own statement, 
did not wish to call, and whom the plaintiff did not insist on calling :— Heldy that 
the question for the jury was, whether the defendants had done everything which, 
under all the circumstances, was likely to be of any use ; and quare, whether the 
action was maintainable at all. Hatch v. Leirif, 467. 

rights of, as to cost?. An agreement with an attorney, that he shall get his costs 
out of the fund in the suit, implies the condition that he is continued in the con-

premises of the defendant, by a person professing to act in his behalf, though 
having no authority to do so, may be ratified by the defendant&apos;s agent, even after 
action, and it is enough that there is an offer to pay, not only without any ac- 
knowledgment, but with a disavowal of the authority. Richardson v. Oxford

before the Court was finished, when they were discharged by the presiding Judge, 
and the prisoner remanded: — Held, that the dismissal of the jury was not equiva- 
lent to an acquittal, and that the prisoner might lawfully be put upon his trial a 
second time. The same rule prevails, whether in cases of misdemeanor or felony.

in an action of trespass by a tenant against his landlord, who justified under a clause 
in the lease allowing a notice to quit, which had been given, and the plaintiff had 
only denied it, and had not pleaded a waiver of it, but sought to set up such waiver 
in consequence of something that occurred during the trial:— Hc/&lt;/, that the 
waiver could not be shown on the pleading as it stood, but should have been 
specially, pleaded, and that the fact that it had not been so pleaded, and was not 
only set up as an after-thought in the course of the case, was strong to show that 
it had never taken place, but if it really had, leave would have been given to 
amend by pleading it, supposing it to have appeared the real question in contro- 
versy between the parties before the trial. Evans v. Whittingstall, 175.

in an action upon a contract in which the consideration was a bill of exchange given 
by the plaintiff to the defendant, who had notice to produce it, hut as the wnr dire 
stated that before the notice he had discounted it with his banker. Held, that it 
must be proved either by production or secondary evidence under the notice to 
produce ; but quttrey whether such secondary evidence was admissible ; semble, 
that it was not, and that the plaintiff&apos;s course was to have had a discovery of its 
custody and served the banker with a subpana duces tecum. Ibid.
