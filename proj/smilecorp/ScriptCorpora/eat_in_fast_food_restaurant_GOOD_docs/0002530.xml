Best Take-Out

Pronto
2955 E. Speedway
 READERS&apos; PICK: Pronto emerges as the readers&apos; favorite
for the fifth year running. It&apos;s certainly quick and easy--it
has a special phone line for call-in orders, so unless you live
right next door, chances are your food will be ready when you
get there. The menu continues to please, with demi-gourmet twists
on the classic categories: burgers, sandwiches, salads and pastas.
Such ingredients as sun-dried tomatoes, tangy Gorgonzola and creamy
buffalo mozzarella cheeses, caramelized onions, delicious slabs
of roasted green chiles, rosemary, basil and garlic set Pronto
apart from its pedestrian competitors. But they still cover the
basics, like good ol&apos; peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. New
this year are the collage-topped cafétables, elegantly
set aglow with votives, illuminating this writer&apos;s favorite take-out
strategy: Don&apos;t call ahead; linger at the counter and order a
Fat Tire ale. Pocket a sumptuous cookie, choose a cool table--like
the one with Elvis&apos; own recipe for deep-fried dill pickle chips;
sit, sip and nibble. Your food will be ready to go before you
are.
 READERS&apos; POLL RUNNER-UP: Boston Market , Four Locations
 A REAL SCREAM: Samurai , 3912 N. Oracle Road, is
a family owned and operated Japanese fast-food restaurant that
kicks ass. Quite possibly, it&apos;s the best meal served in Styrofoam
you&apos;ll ever have. A packed menu of flavorful meals over rice includes
the Yakiniku (sautéed vegetables with lean beef), daily
combination specials and the ever-popular Teriyaki chicken bowl.
Teppan, curry and yaki-soba--you name it, they&apos;ve got it covered
(or more accurately, freshly steamed, grilled or rolled to order).
Snap those chopsticks and dig in!
 A REAL SCREAM: Owner Rudy Lira usually works the counter
at Tania&apos;s , 614 N. Grande Ave. He&apos;s earnest, friendly,
efficient and genuinely concerned about your satisfaction and
well-being when it comes to take-out. Courtesy is the hallmark
of the whole Tania&apos;s experience. Tania&apos;s, with a second location
at 2856 W. Drexel Road, serves up fast, cheap, tasty Mexican
food seven days a week, breakfast lunch and dinner. With Tania&apos;s
party packs and&quot;cold-for-less&quot;carry out, you can feed
yourself, your family or an army for just 99 cents per person.
(Faxed orders receive a 10-percent discount.) Among Tania&apos;s stand-out
items are the seven soups featured daily, including red and white
menudo. If you don&apos;t order from Tania&apos;s at least a couple of times
a week, you probably cook too much.
 A REAL SCREAM: Paco&apos;s Mexican Food , 2645 E. Speedway,
is our take-out/eat-in, fast and fabulous food-dream come true.
Located in the building many townies refer to as the&quot;old
eegee&apos;s store&quot;(near Speedway and Tucson Boulevard), Paco&apos;s
is a relatively new addition to that strip of Speedway; and it&apos;s
holding its own with consistently good, clean, cheap, REAL food.
Real means finely shredded tangy, yellow cheddar, savory grilled
pork and beef, juicy tomatoes, thick and peppery refried beans
and all those yummy gringo condiments (sour cream, guacamole and
mild salsa verde) you&apos;d be embarrassed to order anywhere but through
the anonymity of a drive-thru speaker.
