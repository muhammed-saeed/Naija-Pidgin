 posted 25. April 2005 09:11 PM                      DAYTON, Ohio - A man is suing a fast-food restaurant operator for more than $50,000, claiming he found a slice of skin on his chicken sandwich.



David Scheiding filed the lawsuit in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court on April 1 after rejecting a settlement offer from GZK Inc., his lawyer said. GZK owns the Arby&apos;s restaurant in Tipp City where he bought the sandwich.

At the restaurant that I work at, one of the cooks (who happens to be an owner) put a plate down too hard on the line where the food is prepared and the plate broke in half. He immediately closed down that part of the kitchen and threw out all the food, whether it was covered or not, so that there would be no little piece of glass in any of the food.

How is it ok to slice the skin off of your finger and just toss the little pieces that were around the slicer? IP: Logged  |

The skin was both in the lettuce, and not in the lettuce. Hello. Good morning. Nice to see you.

 posted 25. April 2005 09:47 PM                    I understand that that is disgusting, but why is he suing for $50,000? Once, in high school, I found a piece of raw meat in my salad (and it was not the kind of salad that was supposed to contain any meat at all), and I didn&apos;t even complain - I just did not finish the salad.

For $50,000, I would be willing to endure a lot more than a piece of someone else&apos;s skin in my food. Posts: 3745 | From: New York City | Registered: Jan 2004  | IP: Logged  |

If he&apos;s anything like me, every time he goes out to eat (if he ever does again), he&apos;ll probably have visions of someone&apos;s flesh on his burger.

Yeah, I know there are going to be roach bits and whatnot in some of my food (as allowed by the FDA), but as long as I don&apos;t see it, that&apos;s fine. If someone spits in my food and I don&apos;t know, there&apos;s no harm done, really (unless I catch some funky disease). But if someone tells me about it afterwards, I&apos;d be freaking out.

The law allows you some leverage when it comes to such pain and suffering, though I&apos;d be surprised if they simply don&apos;t settle this out of court.

 posted 29. April 2005 07:53 PM                      When I was a teen, I was in charge of slicing up the lettuce mix for the place I worked.

We used a chef&apos;s knife, nothing so elaborate as a slicer. Anyway, I chopped off a little skin/tip of a finger.

ALL the product I&apos;d worked on was tossed, the stainless table wiped down and dissenfected.

I don&apos;t believe what the manager said, that they discarded anything.

Regardless, finding the skin of someone&apos;s thumb in your food can be pretty traumatic. It&apos;s gross, but it&apos;s also a health hazard.

Xia Once when I went out to eat with my parents at Outback my mom ate a salad with glass in it. Evidently one of the glass salad bowls broke and glass got in her bowl. She ordered a chicken dish that didn&apos;t come with salad but she ate my dad&apos;s since he usually doesn&apos;t care for resturant salads (with the exception of Staley&apos;s where he gets them to give him hearts of letuce rather than the shredded stuff and Olive Garden). Anyway about halfway through my mom wasn&apos;t enjoying it and thought it was gritty/maybe frozen so my dad decided to try it. I should note my dad is a picky eater. We don&apos;t let my dad have things like cucumber or berries in public because he will spit out every seed and line them up on the side of his plate. Anyway, when my dad took a bite he picked out some hard pieces. On his second bite he looked at the bits and realized they were glass. At this point my mom&apos;s feeling worried and ill and I&apos;m not feeling too good myself since I just finished my salad. We let the manager know there was glass in our food. He was only conserned about a lawsuit (never us). We informed him that we had good health coverage, we realized accidents happen, we&apos;ve always had good experiences there before and we weren&apos;t going to sue them. However we didn&apos;t feel much like eating (we were more conserned for our health and saftey at the time and not feeling very hungry anymore). Anyway they deducted the price of my mom&apos;s chicken (not my dad&apos;s more expensive meal that the glass was actually served with), we paid for the other two meals and took them with us. A day or two later we got a call, not asking if we were ok but asking about legal stuff and if we were filing suit. No one ever asked if we were ok. I am not the suing type but that kind of insensitivity really made me want to sue their ass off. Of course we didn&apos;t and we had no real damages but its pretty scary to know you ate (or in my case, could&apos;ve eaten) glass. My mom was really terrified at the thought of what glass might do to her system. Even after she was given the ok on her health she still had chilling thoughts of being cut up internally. I know a resturant probably can&apos;t admit fault for legal reasons (although Outback did with their broken bowl explaination) but they could at least try and show some compasion. Also we were fairly regular customers so they should&apos;ve known we weren&apos;t just trying to scam them.

I don&apos;t like lotto like pay offs for simple mistakes but I do think companies occasionally need a wake-up call. I think there are some customers just looking for a hand out but I think there are others that were just pushed passed the breaking point by the company that wronged them.

That doesn&apos;t change the fact that the restaurant manager, as well as any employees involved, were negligent.

Whatever damages were suffered by Mr. Scheiding should be determined by a factfinder. Not everyone is the type of person who would simply suck it up, pull the half eaten roach out of his burger, and finish his meal. This isn&apos;t a case of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, it&apos;s not about who can eat the grossest thing to win $50K. This will be about what the reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances would do.

Nor did I imply that.

This will be about what the reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances would do. I think you misread my post. I didn&apos;t directly comment on the negligence issue, but implied there was negligence because I said compensation was likely in order. But $50K? Good grief, I hope someone puts some skin in my sandwich so I get a nice bonus if that&apos;s the going rate these days...

 posted 02. May 2005 07:04 PM                      Well, it would be up to you to prove that the skin caused you $50K worth of damages. It&apos;s not supposed to be like a lottery jackpot. I would imagine that this person has to produce some evidence to the fact that he: a) can&apos;t sleep, b) can&apos;t eat, c) suffers from some sort of emotional attacks, etc...

It&apos;s not as if people go to court and are handed a check. Maybe he should have settled. But since neither of us know the extent of his injury, it would be naive for us to comment on whether he has a great chance of winning or losing.

Believe me, if that happened to me, I would not be able to sleep, eat, and would suffer many emotional attacks. Not because of the skin in my food, but because of all the excitement thinking of all that money coming my way...
