You&apos;ve decided that you want to run an Indian restaurant - now decide how you will achieve this. Will you:

 buy an existing business purchase a franchise start up a new business from scratch 

The course of action you choose will affect the costs you will incur and may also affect how soon you start to receive income from the venture.

 This Business Guide will help you to complete your cash flow. The topics listed under Income and Expenditure relate to fields in the cash flow section of the Business Plan. 

Cash sales

&apos;Cash sales&apos; means all income from your main business activity which you receive at the time of sale. Although some customers may pay you in cash, remember that Cash sales can also include:

 cheques debit and credit card payments vouchers - for example Luncheon Vouchers - if you decide to accept these 

To prepare your cash flow, you will need to estimate how much income you will receive over the next 12 months, including VAT. To do this you will have to estimate how many meals and drinks you are likely to sell, and at what price.

There are a number of things to consider when you make your estimates, depending on the type of business you are planning:

Type of business

 who will your customers be? Will you target a particular category of customer or will you aim to appeal to a broad cross-section how many seats will your restaurant have will you offer a take-away service will you offer a delivery service will you sign up to an online take-away ordering service such as Just-Eat will you cater for private functions will you open at lunch-time what will your evening opening hours be - this will affect the number of sittings you can have will you have live music and a dance floor where will you find trained and skilled staff - you may have difficulty in bringing specialist chefs into the country will you apply for a licence to sell alcohol 

Your products

 will you offer a traditional range of meals, or will you introduce new, lower fat dishes will you offer a specific type of cuisine such as Punjabi, Nepalese and so on who will plan your menus, decide on portion sizes and draw up recipes will you make everything from scratch, or will you buy-in sauces, ready made doughs and so on will you have daily &apos;specials&apos; will your menu change to take advantage of seasonal produce how will you monitor which are popular and unpopular meals will you offer Fairtrade products how will you control and monitor wastage will you have seasonal surges, for example at Christmas time what range of alcoholic drinks will you stock (if you decide to do so) 

Pricing

 what will your pricing policy be - will you target the cheaper &apos;after pub&apos; end of the market or will you charge a higher price for your meals and aim to attract a less price-sensitive clientele what gross profit rate will you aim to achieve on food and drinks will you charge extra for vegetables and accompaniments or will these be included in the price of a main course will you offer any discounts, free meals or drinks to any customers will you have a buffet offering &apos;all you can eat for...&apos; will your prices include a service charge how often will you review your prices what will your policy on staff tips be - for example, will tips be put into a central pool, or &apos;tronc&apos;, and distributed to staff by a &apos;troncmaster&apos;? It&apos;s against the law to use tips and service charges to make up your employees&apos; wages to the National Minimum Wage level 

Competition

Competition for Indian restaurants is intense and in recent years has led to price wars and to very low margins. Your competitors will include:

 other Indian restaurants in your area all other catering and leisure outlets pubs, particularly those which have decided to offer curry dishes. Many pubs have weekly &apos;curry nights&apos; 

You also face competition from the huge range of Indian home ready meals which are available from supermarkets, as well as prepared sauces which enable customers to quickly prepare an authentic Indian meal themselves.

This makes it essential that your proposed restaurant has a &apos;unique selling point&apos; or USP - in other words something special that will attract customers to your establishment rather than to your competitors.
