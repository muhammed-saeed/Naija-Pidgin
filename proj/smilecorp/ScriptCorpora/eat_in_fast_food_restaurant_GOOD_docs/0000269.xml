 Workers Compensation for Bars and Taverns 

 by bruce »Wed Jan 18, 2006 12:44 pm
 I&apos;m looking for a WC market in California besides that State Fund that will entertain Bars and Taverns, i.e. more than 40% food sales - class 9079. Any suggestions? bruce Insurance Journal Fan   Posts: 1 Joined: Wed Jan 18, 2006 12:32 pm Location: San Rafael, California

 I have an A rated employee leasing market. Typically works well with bars and taverns due to high turnover. Call me if you would like to discuss in more detail. Staff Brokers Inc.
