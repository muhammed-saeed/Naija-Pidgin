The Northern Premier

Next season FC United will be playing at Step 4 of the non-league pyramid. Following restructuring of the non-league pyramid at this level The Northern Premier League now consists of 22 teams in the Premier Division and 18 teams in each of the First Divisions North and South. The clubs joining us in the Northern Premier League First Division North will be:

Bamber Bridge, Bradford Park Avenue, Bridlington, Chorley, Clitheroe, Curzon Ashton, Garforth Town, Harrogate RA, Lancaster City, Mossley, Newcastle Blue Star, Ossett Albion, Radcliffe Borough, Rossendale United, Skelmersdale United, Wakefield, Woodley Sports.

When the FA announced the details of the restructuring a number of clubs complained that a 34 game season was too short. To address this perceived shortfall the clubs decided to have an extra eight games; four to be played at home and four to be played away.

To facilitate these additional games each division will be split into two groups of nine clubs:

Group A - Bamber Bridge, Chorley, Clitheroe, FC United of Manchester, Lancaster City, Radcliffe Borough, Rossendale United, Skelmersdale United, Woodley Sports.

When the fixtures are announced we will be playing the teams in Group A three times (four at home twice and once away plus four away twice and once at home)

(Further details on the restructruing can be found at www.tonykempster.co.uk)


A New Home Kit
http://fcumfiles.co.uk/images/newshirt200708newsitem2.jpg

The decision to have a new home kit was taken at the last AGM by all club owners, a contest was opened for designs, then after a selection process, a short list drawn up with the winning design voted for by club owners.

The decision for no shirt sponsor was taken a few AGMs back


The Great Season Ticket Challenge

Supporters may have seen the club has announced season ticket prices for next season and at the same time presented you, our supporters with a challenge.

The club has stated that if a thousand season tickets can be sold before the 16th July, matching last seasons sales, then the price will be frozen for the third season running at 6 per game for adults and just 1 per match for under 18s.

Also, in acknowledging that for some a months notice may prove too short, we have offered adults the option of paying a 50 deposit at first, with the remaining balance paid nearer the start of the season, with all deposits counting towards the challenge total.

Full details and how to apply here http://fcumfiles.co.uk/story.php?story_id=1003

FC United General Manager Andy Walsh explains: At a time of escalating prices throughout football we felt it important to continue to offer our supporters a cheap alternative. At six quid a game and only a pound for under 18s we believe we do that.

Not only that, but by effectively offering an all-too-rare instalments option with the deposit scheme, we are addressing the common problem of supporters having to find the whole amount of their season ticket at one go.

He continued: It has been a frustrating few weeks whilst we awaited confirmation from the League of how many games we would play next season which has caused the delay in this announcement, but its all systems go now and everyone at the club cant wait for the new season, a new league and a new challenge.

Much talk from the community based club that any new ground should be a prtnership project including (my suggestions) schools, health and fitness centre, NHS walk ins centre, tie in with the Universities.

Some talk I have heard that a future ground would be be initially two stands with space to expand at the remaining side/end if necessary.

Sensible and not so sensible suggestions about the what and where of Stade de FC. gothicform June 26th, 2007, 04:17 PM im not a big football follower, partly because its being raped by big business but things like this restore some of my faith in it. TheGrand July 3rd, 2007, 01:20 PM Margy&apos;s reaction to FA Trophy draw

FC United of Manchester have been drawn away to Bradford Park Avenue in the Preliminary round of the FA Carlsberg Trophy with the match due to be played on Saturday 6th October 2007.

If United win they will progress to the First Qualifying Round where they will face Sheffield FC at home which is scheduled for Saturday 20th October 2007.

Manager Karl Marginson knows that the West Yorkshire club, who narrowly missed out on promotion to the Unibond Northern Premier Division last season after losing in a play off to Eastwood Town, will present a tricky task.

He said: Its a tough one. Theyre throwing a lot of money into it this year so they should be a good side. Its one well look forward to though as always and I imagine, providing we do the business, they will be rivals for the title this season so itll be a good insight into where we stand.

If the Reds are victorious they will enjoy the chance to renew acquaintances with the oldest football club in the world, Sheffield FC, who edged a 1-0 victory over Margys men in July 2006 at the Don Valley Stadium during a preseason friendly. TheGrand July 3rd, 2007, 01:21 PM Margy&apos;s reaction to FA Cup draw

FC United of Manchester have been drawn away against Trafford or Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the Preliminary Round of the FA Cup with the match scheduled to take place on Saturday 1st September 2007.

If the Reds win they will progress to the First Qualifying Round where they will face Fleetwood Town away on Saturday 15th September 2007.

Manager Karl Marginson was pleased to be guaranteed to begin the clubs inaugural FA Cup campaign against a familiar team after competing against and beating both Trafford and Atherton LR last season en route to the North West Counties Division One title.

He said: We know all about Trafford and LR so well go into that one with plenty of confidence. With the up most respect we should be able to win that, but if we do itll be a tough one against Fleetwood as theyre in the division above and theyve been pushing for promotion for the last couple of years.

Margy is fully aware that a trip to Fleetwood and the Fylde coast would go down very well with the clubs army of travelling supporters who enjoyed a similar seaside excursion to Blackpool in the first season. He added: Hopefully well be able to do the business against Trafford or Atherton and everybody will be able to have a good knees up in Fleetwood. JonH July 3rd, 2007, 01:58 PM Great to see FC in the same league at Chorley and Bamber Bridge, means two games near me. Also good to see them playing Lancaster City, will be some much needed funds for that club. heatonparkincakes July 5th, 2007, 02:53 PM Where would people have the FC United ground.It could a major sporting arena, that could also offer some area regeneration as well as being an interesting architectural and engineering work.

It is obviously governed by a number of factors.

1. That FC United is not United Fc and doesnt have a huge amount of money. So I cant see it being build on where Boddingtons was and Granada is for the moment.

2. Even though a 70,000 seater stadium isnt the answer, any new ground will ahve to occupy a serious size piece of land. Where is that in Manchester?

3. It will ahve to be a prtnership with a council, its educatio dept, a university, NHS, etc. So it needs to be in an accessible and community centred space.

4. I would hope (unlike Salford RLFC) it is accessible by public transport and eco friendly.

Any suggestions. TheGrand July 6th, 2007, 12:50 AM MANCAT and FC United of Manchester Announce Link

FC United of Manchester and MANCAT are to work together in developing local young football talent.

The new partnership will offer the young people of Greater Manchester an opportunity to develop both their footballing and educational abilities.

MANCAT is holding a Football Training Development Day on 9th July from 4.30-7pm to allow Year 11 pupils the opportunity to sample the colleges Sports Academy before the new academic year starts in September.

Those who attend the event will also have the chance to impress FC United scouts, as representatives from the club will be watching the session hoping to catch an early glimpse of the talented young players who plan to join MANCATs Sports Academy in September.

The Sports Academy is exclusively open to MANCATs sixth form students and provides them with expert football coaching and the opportunity to play in a successful college team whilst studying on a full-time course.

MANCATs link with FC United will give its highly talented Sports Academy students the chance of progressing into the FC Uniteds own youth team.

Any players interested in going to the Football Training Development Day at the Nicholls Community Football Centre of Excellence in Ardwick should call the MANCAT Schools Liaison Team now on 0161 953 2267 for an application form.

In welcoming the partnership FC Uniteds General Manager Andy Walsh said

Both FC United and MANCAT are committed to working across all the communities of Greater Manchester to improve the quality of sports coaching and education. Our coaches will be working with MANCAT staff to develop individual coaching development plans for both coaches and players.

FC United will continue to compete in the North West Youth Alliance with the MANCAT/FC United team competing in the National Youth Conference Football League.

Plans to develop the relationship further in the longer term include a womens team and opportunities volunteers to gain qualifications. TheGrand July 12th, 2007, 04:09 PM http://www.fcumfiles.co.uk/images/yourclubneedsyou3.jpg

Two first half goals from FC Uniteds player of the 2006/07 season, Rory Patterson were enough to get the Reds pre-season campaign off to a winning 2-1 start against Studley FC and secure the Jimmy Davis Memorial Cup.

The match was played in a competitive but friendly manner as the main purpose of the day was to raise money for the memorial fund which helps young, up and coming footballers.

United had virtually two different teams in the first and second halves as manager Karl Marginson seems keen to give run outs to as many different players as possible before the start of the season.

Former Salford City midfielder Dale Whitehead and ex-Flixton striker and Bolton Wanderers trainee Anthony Hargreaves were both given debuts and a number of the clubs youngsters were given the chance to show what they can do in the first team.

Young forwards Lee Ellis and Gary Edwards both had opportunities to seal the game in the second half before Studley threatened to get back into things late on by converting a penalty. But it wasnt enough and United saw out the game at 2-1 to lift the cup, rounding off a good work out for the players old and new and another good day out for Uniteds army of travelling supporters who enjoyed some rare July sunshine. TheGrand July 19th, 2007, 08:42 PM Exeter City director in key election

FC United are pleased to hear that the Vice Chairman and Sporting Director of Exeter City, Julian Tagg has been elected onto the Board of Blue Square Premier (formerly Conference) for the forthcoming season, becoming the first member of a supporters owned club to achieve this.

As many FC United fans will be aware, Exeter City Supporters Trust saved the Grecians from near extinction in 2003 when they took over the running of the club from chairman, John Russell and vice-chairman, Mike Lewis who had seen debts rise to around 3million and had both been arrested over concerns of financial irregularities.

Julian was one of three people who took over the day-to-day running of the Devonshire outfit four years ago but he has been at Exeter City since 1997 when he started out as a youth team coach.

Julians passion for the Grecians, the city and for the players he had coached over the years made him determined to help save the club. Its that enthusiasm, resolve and experience he is hoping to bring to the Board which governs the Blue Square Premier as well as the North and South divisions.

He told FC Uniteds official website: Its the first time a director of a supporters owned club has been elected to the Board and hopefully it will be the first of many because I believe its the way forward.

Theres so much boom and bust in football, lots of clubs are on a real rollercoaster ride. Many people feel that they own their football club but they dont because anyone can come in and buy it. Supporters have always been too far away from the running of their football clubs and its not right.

Julian hopes being on the Board will enable him to pass on the experiences he has had at Exeter City to other football clubs around the country. The Board should carry some clout too as one of the other directors for the forthcoming season is Mancunian peer and Labour Party politician Lord Richard Faulkner.

Julian said: Ill be able to bring the experience of where the club has come from and hopefully help other clubs avoid the same situation because that sort of thing doesnt help the fans, the football clubs or the city.

Julian agrees that Exeter benefited in the end from the club being on the brink because the supporters were able to gain control, but he doesnt believe that would be a good way forward for other clubs. He added: Im not saying our way is the only way to do things, far from it, the key thing is that football clubs listen to their supporters and let them have a say. skyhigh247 July 20th, 2007, 11:23 AM Bearing in mind this is a skyscraper site and this thread is for a small football team, why not have a private blog, rather than a thread on a skyscraper site. Especially since, out of the 10 messages here, you are responsible for 7 of them.

I thought it would be better to keep the skyscraper forum just to what it says on the tin.

Isaac Newell July 20th, 2007, 01:02 PM FC United should be treated as a new construction, they are a recent creation and will eventually build a small stadium.

It would still be so small as to be more of a shed than a stadium. It&apos;s hardly Arsenal and a 400 million huge stadium is it?? That was why i thought, unless there is a huge stadium going for planning, then this forum wouldn&apos;t really be ideal for this kind of thread. heatonparkincakes July 20th, 2007, 01:44 PM Could we keep some relevance to these boards in relation

I will ignore the shed reference. Erm.

FC is a supporters run club and doesnt have the financial clout of the various sporting franchises/tax dodging/money laundering/assett stripping schemes sorry football clubs that exist elsewhere in manchester.

As its been said before a new FC ground would be an interesting community based development that might have some impact on other socially conscious and useful developments and how it should be financed and run. skyhigh247 July 20th, 2007, 02:43 PM FC is a supporters run club and doesnt have the financial clout of the various sporting franchises/tax dodging/money laundering/assett stripping schemes sorry football clubs that exist elsewhere in manchester.

I think bets are being taken as we speak as to how much longer Leeds Utd can exist. I hope FC United never fall into that hole. Chorltonred July 20th, 2007, 03:10 PM FC United are the epitome of the anti-establishment spirit that makes this city great. You should treasure them as such even if you don&apos;t support them.

While the Scousers, Citeh and Chelski do fuck all but spread their butt cheeks wide when the new foreign &apos;owners&apos; arrive, SOME united fans have tried to provide an alternative which sees the fans in charge and not being ripped off and messed about by the likes of Sky. TheGrand&apos;s enviable passion for the cause is most admirable.

And has been said, it&apos;ll be interesting to see whether they find a new ground and whether their progress up the leagues carries on.

And lets be honest, only a minority of threads on here are about buildings, never mind tall ones!

Keep up the good work. TheGrand July 21st, 2007, 12:36 PM This topic is now in its third year, Andy Simmo started the first one after his Big united one got hijacked, I started the second one, and this is the third one.

And in every one this subject has cropped up, basically you should look around this forum and have a look at the various threads which have no link with construction or skyscrapers whatsoever, but instead have a connection with Manchester in another way, and show Manchester off culturally instead.

And yes Im pretty much the only one posting, but look at the view count, it obviously interests people how this Manc experiment is doing and progressing.

You should also remember that if its not your cup of tea, you dont have to open up :)

FC United is quite unique and quite something else in football, this is basically 3,000 Mancs (with a few out of towners) coming at it in the good old Manc tradition of saying&quot;nah that&apos;s bollocks, we should do it this way&quot;.

And of all the three threads created for this club/movement, this season is the one to watch. There will be news on the ground this year, there will be news on the training fascilities, and fuck me, we could really make our mark this year with us entering the FA Cup (we could play Leeds in the first round :lol: ) Imagine that.

So in closing, blogs are shit, people read this, skyscraper forum but also a culture forum, this topic isnt new on here, and anyway, its weekend! :banana: skyhigh247 July 21st, 2007, 01:46 PM The only point i was getting at is, this isn&apos;t a &apos;Manchester&apos; forum, it&apos;s a forum about construction developments on a large scale in Manchester.

All three teams WANT investment, thanks. Your bitter lot are whining because of the debt.&quot;The Scousers&quot;chose new investers well, turning down several offers whereas you lot got their buttcheeks firmly parted against their will (unlike City, Chelsea and LFC) and thus FCUM came of it.

If Liverpool didn&apos;t want investment, I&apos;m sure they&apos;d be just as angry.

By the way, the reason why I come on here is because I love Manchester and want to know whats going on in my city.

I&apos;m not clicking on all these links. Personal attacks at myself are well out of order. This is not a forum about everything in Manchester, it is about large construction projects or buildings in Manchester. I also know what is going on in the city i was born and bred in, but what that has to do with a football club that has nothing to do with large construction projects in Manchester i don&apos;t know. TheGrand July 21st, 2007, 02:24 PM All three teams WANT investment, thanks. Your bitter lot are whining because of the debt.&quot;The Scousers&quot;chose new investers well, turning down several offers whereas you lot got their buttcheeks firmly parted against their will (unlike City, Chelsea and LFC) and thus FCUM came of it.

If Liverpool didn&apos;t want investment, I&apos;m sure they&apos;d be just as angry. I know of hardly any who opposed Hicks and Gillet&apos;s arrival.

Im not sure United did get dry shafted against their will, as the majority of United supporters couldnt give a monkeys, though thats changing gradualy as the screw is turned on ticket prices. Even Bobby Charlton apologised to the Glazers on our behalf :ohno:

So on the surface, you wouldnt know many who were opposed to Glazer&apos;s investment (if you can call it that), its just United fans were more organised in the direction of trying to block a takeover, whereas Liverpool fans have been slightly preoccupied with getting the title back and the Justice for the 96 campaign. So 3,000 did something about it and formed FC, and a few pissed off Liverpool fans went back into the woodwork. TheGrand July 21st, 2007, 02:26 PM I&apos;m not clicking on all these links.

FC United got their pre-season campaign off to a winning start at the weekend when they beat Studley FC 2-1 to clinch the Jimmy Davis Memorial Cup, but the hard work of training had already begun in earnest. Mark Swanwick catches up with manager Karl Marginson to get the all the latest pre-season news from the training ground...

The recent smoking ban may be dividing opinion across the country, but it is certainly having a positive effect on the health of the FC United first team squad as they return for pre-season training.

Simon Carden has cut down on his fags now weve gone smoke-free! exclaims Margy. Which is great news for both the lungs of the talismanic midfielder and for fans who have come to rely on Carden at the heart of a double-winning Reds side.

The first couple of weeks are never much fun as its all about fitness work, but Ive been really impressed with the work theyve put in. Theyre looking hungry for the new season.

The summer break has seen big changes off the pitch for some of the squad. Scoring sensation Rory Patterson has netted himself a new baby girl and Alex Mortimer has returned bearing an unlikely tan. Normally he looks like he sunbathes in a submarine! jokes Margy about the pale-skinned full-back. Even the sun-shy skin of Rob Nugent has received a new lick of bronze paint. He should be careful though, warns Margy. Its a bit dangerous, what with his hair colour!

Getting back to business, new trialists Dale Whitehead and Anthony Hargreaves had a first run out at Studley and the manager is confident the newcomers are good enough to be pushing for places in the first team: Hopefully, theyll be giving me a headache when it comes to selection over the coming months.

The boss is also happy to report that theres no lingering injuries left over from last season: Dave Swarbrick is back in training too, which is great news as itll be like having a new signing after his long lay-off.

A fully fit squad will be needed as the Reds have a busy pre-season schedule. Four more friendlies lie ahead, with trips to Trafford, AFC Wimbledon, Ashton United and Kidderminster.

Kidderminster will be a tough one, admits Margy. But FC fans can rest easy knowing that the boss is working hard to combat a side three divisions higher up the ladder than United. His cunning masterplan? Oh I dunno, Ill just wake up on Saturday morning and take it from there! he reveals. Harriers beware. TheGrand July 25th, 2007, 04:07 PM FC United North Trafford Tournament

FC UNITED&apos;s season ticket sales have risen by a third as the club prepares for life in the UniBond League first division next month.

The Rebels have frozen the price of season tickets at the equivalent of 6 per match and 1 per match for under-18s after challenging supporters to break the 1,000 barrier by July 16.

That target was reached as sales of season tickets rose by 33 per cent, and a club spokesman said:&quot;This is a phenomenal achievement and we&apos;d like to thank all our supporters for showing their commitment to the club.

&quot;It was a magnificent response to what was an ambitious challenge, but as usual supporters have come through for their club.

&quot;Season ticket sales are up 33 per cent on this time last year and with a month still to go before the start of the season we hope that the figure rises even higher, which will help us to stick to our philosophy of providing affordable football.&quot;

FC&apos;s proposed friendly at Kidderminster on Saturday was a victim of the wet weather and is now scheduled for Sunday at 3pm, 24 hours after they send a team to Nantwich for a friendly.

Postponement of the Kidderminster match meant a stronger team than planned took to the field at Blackpool Mechanics last Sunday and goals from Jerome Wright and Rory Patterson gave the Rebels a solid 2-1 win heatonparkincakes July 27th, 2007, 02:36 PM FC UNITED OF MANCHESTER VISIT GIANT AXE FOR THE FIRST GAME OF THE NEW SEASON ON SATURDAY 18th AUGUST 2007 KICK OFF 3.00pm

If the Jimmy Davis Memorial Cup at Studley two weeks ago was the most fulfilling friendly of our pre-season schedule then this Sundays match has to be the most testing. Craig Phillips provides this preview

Our next opponents are Blue Square Premier (formerly the Conference) side Kidderminster Harriers in a rearrangement of the friendly that was called off last weekend due to a waterlogged pitch. It should be a real assessment of where Margys squad is at the moment as it sets out to face a club not only three divisions above but also one that was playing in the Football League as recently as 2005.

For United, the friendly could have shades of last seasons encounter with fellow Conference side Halifax Town, when he Reds beat the Shaymen 4-2 at their Shay Stadium. Uniteds first ever goal scorer Steve Torpey impressed so much in the game, including scoring a superb solo effort, he was signed by the West Yorkshire outfit just days later.

Supporters will no doubt be hoping that lightening doesnt strike twice in that respect but no-one could begrudge any of the players moving on to a much higher level if they were given the opportunity.

Kidderminster are a club steeped in history having been established since 1877. They were involved in the first professional match to be officiated by three women back in 1999 when they lost 2-1 to Nuneaton Borough and they also hold the record for the furthest FA Cup run by a non-league team.

In the 1993/94 season, the Harriers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup by beating Birmingham City 2-1 at St Andrews and Preston North End 1-0 at home before being narrowly edged out of the competition 1-0 by West Ham in front of almost 8,000 people at their Aggborough stadium.

The West Midlanders also added another impressive accolade to their history books earlier this year when they were involved in the first club match at the new Wembley stadium in front of a bumper crowd of 53,262, although they did lose the FA Trophy final 2-1 to Stevenage Borough.

The match will also be good for Harriers as they prepare to start their league campaign against Aldershot on August 11. They will be looking to put last seasons success in the Trophy into their league from this season and improve on their finishing position of 10th last year.

Margy will probably look to field the same team for most of the match and there wont be wholesale changes like in the Studley and Blackpool Mechanics matches. Its a good chance to benchmark our current squad and should provide an entertaining day for all.

The game will take place at the Aggborough Stadium in Kidderminster at 3pm on Sunday. Supporters can pay on the gate and admission prices are 10 adults, 5 senior citizens and 5 under-16s. TheGrand July 30th, 2007, 12:28 PM United boss makes it a special night

DELAMERE Rangers under 13s had a special guest helping them prepare for the new season in a new league.

Karl Marginson, team manager of FC United, took the Gorton and Openshaw clubs regular Tuesday training session in Abbey Hey as they got set to embark on their first season in the Stockport Metro League after several successful years in the Reddish and District League.

Former Macclesfield Town striker Karl said: Delamere Rangers are a great example of what ordinary people can do for their community. In their relatively short existence they have grown from one small team to have 10 teams, and it is an honour to have them as an associate club.

AdvertisementClub secretary and coach Paul Peters said: Karl was superb. His professionalism was obvious, but his enthusiasm is what impressed me most.

Karl, in partnership with Delamere coach Lee Rattigan, and Manchester City Council, has recently been involved in delivering coaching sessions to youngsters on the Ryder Brow estate in Gorton.

The next scheme there is due to run in the school holidays.

I just reckon it will be in Manchester City Council boundaries, Sir Richard Leece was at our last home game last year for example.

It cant really happen in Trafford for obvious reasons, it cant happen in Tameside as their non league scene is saturated. It wont happen in Salford because I dont think we want to go back there after that first Willows game but you never know of course.

So that leaves Manchester City Council, and I just think it will be in the North of the city, as to the west is Salford, East is City and South is United, so yeh, Newton Heath for me, romance isnt dead after all Isaac Newell July 30th, 2007, 01:26 PM I think anywhere in the City boundary close to the centre will be too expensive.

Giggs and co draw blood
By Peter McKinney

Kidderminster Harriers 1 FC United of Manchester 1

HARRIERS were held by an attack minded FC United side in an entertaining draw at Aggborough on Sunday afternoon.

The home team took on a Manchester based team which had the likes of Giggs and Hargreaves playing for them - unfortunately they were midfielder Anthony Hargreaves and Rhrodri Giggs -brother of Red Devils winger Ryan.

However, the visitors certainly played with Manchester United&apos;s attacking style and constantly worried a strong Harriers side.

Manager Mark Yates was able to give towering defender Mark Creighton, a key player from last season, a useful 45 minute run out that will blow the cobwebs off his joints.

The only trialists on display were Jon Munday, who has been given an extended time in the side because of captain Stuart Whitehead&apos;s injury, and former Cinderford player Matthew Williams.

Striker James Constable, enjoying his first start in pre-season, headed Brian Smikle&apos;s cross at keeper Sam Ashton in the third minute.

Scott Bevan showed alertness when he was forced to rush out and block Rory Patterson, who had beat Harriers&apos; offside trap when chasing Rhrodri Gigg&apos;s high pass.

The experimental strike partnership of Constable and Richards showed glimpses of promise.

Constable&apos;s slide rule pass released his strike partner down the left wing, and Richards sped past Steve Spencer and delivered a good cross that Alex Mortimer headed off the line.

Richards was left cursing himself in the 24th minute when he stretched for Smikle&apos;s cross and but could only knock it to Ashton.

But his self frustration almost spurred him into a spectacular opener a minute later, when he collected Constable&apos;s pass with his back to goal, spun and let fly with a shot that Ashton did well to acrobatically turn away.

Worryingly for Yates, Harriers&apos; confidence going forward seemed to ebb away and the home side sat back and lost its way in midfield, allowing United to control the game in the last 15 minutes of the first half.

The visitor&apos;s pressure paid off in the 40th minute when Rory Patterson opened the scoring.

The striker was off side when he controlled Shaun Roscoe&apos;s long ball but the linesman&apos;s flag was not raised and he slotted it past Scott Bevan.

Harriers enjoyed some good fortune and were back on level terms three minutes later.

Ashton spilled Alex Mortimer&apos;s back pass and Smikel was on hand to roll the ball into the back of the net.

The lively Patterson had the first shot of the second half but this time Bevan was more than equal to his rising effort.

Munday caused a few Harriers fans&apos; hearts to flutter when he directed a stray pass to striker Jerome Wright, but he made up for his error by tracking back and forcing him into a speculative cross in the 51st minute.

United, who were backed by a small but vocal travelling army of 176 fans, had to replace Anthony Hargreaves after he was injured by Munday&apos;s sliding challenge from behind.

A flurry of substitutions by the home side broke up the flow of an entertaining game.

Brian Smikle, who was alert throughout, almost scored an own goal on the 64 minute mark but steered Wright&apos;s incisive pass just past the left hand post.

Substitute Matthew Barnes-Homer and Russ Penn combined well to set up Constable but the striker was a fraction offside.

Penn should have done better when Ferrell found him in the box but he hesitated and tried a speculative cross/shot that was headed away.

Howarth headed Jeff Kenna&apos;s free-kick over and Barnes-Homer flicked a shot wide but Bevan spared Harriers&apos; blushes late on.

Rhrodri Giggs showed some of his illustrious relation&apos;s skill when he skipped past the giant keeper, who stuck out a long arm to deny the winger.

All in all it was a decent workout for Harriers, who will need to step up a higher level for Tuesday&apos;s home friendly against Walsall.

HARRIERS: Bevan, Harkness, Hurren (Munday, 81mins), Creighton (McGrath, 45mins), Constable (Boukhalfa, 81mins), Richards (Barnes-Homer, 61mins) Blackwood (Howarth, 81mins), Smikle, Munday (Penn, 51mins), Ferrell, Bignot (Williams, 68mins).

Adam Derbyshire

Rebel club FC United are offering kids in Tameside the chance to watch the team for free this season.

The local supporters branch has four tickets available for each and every match just waiting to be snapped up.

The club, which was set up by protesting Manchester United fans opposed to the takeover by American businessman Malcom Glazer, is keen to forge strong links with youngsters and is determined not to see them priced out of football.

Successive promotion in their first two seasons will see the club locking horns with Mossley and Curzon Ashton in the league next season. Kind hearted kit man George Hayden, of Old Road, Ashton, bought two extra junior season tickets to give out free and the club has matched his generous offer.

George, 42, said:&quot;The idea to buy additional season tickets on top of our own renewals and then offer them out to kids across Manchester came from a supporters meeting we held.

&quot;So we now have four and are offering them to kids in the area on a match-by-match basis to whoever wants them.

&quot;The only criteria is that they have to live in Tameside and be under 18.

&quot;We initially have four tickets per match to offer, but if any schools or youth groups are interested it might be possible to get more from a larger pool&quot;

Fellow volunteer Vinny Thompson added:&quot;This is just another example of the work the club is doing with communities across Manchester.

&quot;Here in Tameside, the club is looking to extend their work with St Peters Youth, Tameside Youth Prevention Services and Dovestones at Tameside College&quot;

Anyone interested in the offer should log on to www.tamesideisred.co.uk TheGrand August 2nd, 2007, 12:47 PM A Wombling welcome awaits

Saturday is set to be another fantastic occasion in the short history of FC United as the club reaffirms its excellent sporting relationship with AFC Wimbledon by returning to The Fans Stadium in Kingston-upon-Thames for a pre-season friendly.

Two years have past since officials from the supporters-owned London club helped members of the FC United Steering Committee transform our club from an idea to reality within a matter of days and as a small token of appreciation the Reds sent a team to Kingston to compete in the Supporters Direct Trophy.

Despite some excellent keeping from Uniteds young shot-stopper Barrie George, Manchesters newest team were defeated 1-0. But regardless of the scoreline, the majority of people who attended the match on that sunny July Saturday in 2005 were convinced they were witnessing the start of something very special.

And the believers were right to be optimistic. Since that day, United have gone from strength to strength, with two successive promotions, both as champions, and last season they completed a sensational double for good measure by winning the North West Counties League Challenge Cup. Record breaking average crowds in the North West Counties of more than 2,500 have also helped to ensure that the last two years have indeed been rather special.

So, with more than a hint of nostalgia in the air, tracing footsteps back to how it all began, its unsurprising that this fixture has been eagerly awaited by many of the travelling Red army who are sure to be out in force contributing to a sizeable and no doubt raucous crowd at the 4,500 capacity stadium.

And the football promises not to be too bad either. Formed three years before FC United, AFC Wimbledon are in the Ryman Premier Division one step higher in the football pyramid than the Reds. The Dons narrowly missed out on promotion in their inaugural season, but came back emphatically the following year with a league and cup double whilst remaining undefeated in the league all season.

The following year, in the 2004/05 season, they were at it again another league and cup double saw them Wombling into the Ryman Premier Division with ease. Gaining a third promotion has been a little bit tougher though, beaten in the play-off semi-finals in 2005/06 and 2006/07 both times by the eventual winners.

Two years ago isnt the only time United have faced Wimbledon of course. This time last year, United further strengthened its relationship with the Dons by inviting them up to Gigg Lane. The Reds won that day 2-1 with Dave Brown heading the decisive goal. That puts the record between the two clubs at one victory each, so no doubt both teams will be hoping to record their second victory in the fixture this Saturday. Whatever the result though, its sure to be a great footballing occasion.

The game is to be played at The Fans Stadium, Kingsmeadow, Jack Goodchild Way, 422a Kingston Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, KT1 3PB. Admission is pay on the gate. Prices are:

Seats
9 Adults
5 Concessions
3 Under 16s

Terrace
7 Adults
4 Concessions
Under 16s Free (under 12s must be accompanied by an adult)

FC UNITED went down 2-1 to Trafford in a potential dress rehearsal of next month&apos;s FA Cup clash.

The breakaway club are due to meet Trafford or Atherton LR in the preliminary round of the famous competition on September 1.

But manager Karl Marginson will not be unduly concerned about the result after fielding a select XI in Tuesday&apos;s night&apos;s friendly defeat.

The Gigg Lane outfit, who drew with Kidderminster on Sunday and were in action again last night against Atherton Collieries, continue their pre-season preparations with a trip to AFC Wimbledon on Saturday ahead of the start of the start of the new season on August 18. TheGrand August 8th, 2007, 12:38 PM United beaten by Wombles

An out of sorts FC United went down 2-0 away to AFC Wimbledon, but if truth be told the defeat could have been a lot heavier if it wasnt for some good keeping from Reds shot-stopper Sam Ashton.

The former Bolton Wanderers trainee pulled off some real heroics including a great penalty save midway through the first half. However, he could do nothing to stop Daniel Webb breaking the deadlock 40 minutes in and salt was rubbed in the wounds when Anthony Finn doubled the lead on the stroke of half time.

Manager Karl Marginson called in the cavalry at the interval with Rory Patterson, Rhodri Giggs and Josh Howard being introduced into the action. Together with the seemingly always dangerous Jerome Wright, the trio gave United some fresh impetus.

Patterson went close on a couple of occasions including one audacious volley from a corner kick that soared wide and Giggs could have scored with a header at the death. But the Dons defence stood firm and keeper Andy Little made some good stops without ever looking too overly troubled.

The day provided another good work out for United against a team one division higher in the football pyramid and the 800 or so travelling supporters seemed unperturbed by the scoreline, singing their hearts out as usual throughout the match. TheGrand August 8th, 2007, 12:40 PM Local derbies complete pre-season

http://www.fcumfiles.co.uk/images/friendlies07b.jpg

FC United travel to near neighbours Abbey Hey and Ashton United this week in the final two pre-season warm ups before the season gets underway a week on Saturday at Lancaster City. Craig Phillips provides this preview...

The Reds know all about Wednesdays opponents, Abbey Hey after beating them three times last season and scoring no fewer than 14 goals against them in the process. The two clubs have also forged a good relationship off the pitch with Uniteds reserve side playing their home games at the Abbey Stadium.

The match should provide a good midweek work out whilst giving a number of fringe players another chance to prove themselves in the first team in what should be a proper friendly environment.

Saturdays game will probably prove to be a little bit more competitive. Originally formed as Hurst FC in 1878, Ashton United are currently preparing for the new season in the UniBond Premier Division, one step up from United.

The game will be the final chance for both teams to iron out any creases and work on tactics and fitness before the season kicks off. Margy will be looking for his team to bounce back after suffering defeats to Trafford and AFC Wimbledon in the past week.

Theres also the matter of local bragging rights as United face the Robins for the first time in their short history. Ashton should provide a tough test but after they narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier Division last season in 18th place, the Reds shouldnt be overawed by them.

Their pre-season hasnt been as good as they would have hoped either. Although they have had a 2-2 draw with Blue Square Premier side Droylsden, the Robins have lost their last two games away to Salford City 4-1 and at home to Mossley 2-1.

On the current playing staff is former FC United captain Bill McCartney, who faced United last season with Trafford in the epic 4-4 draw towards the end of the season, scoring the late equaliser.

United are without the injured Stuart Rudd who will be out for around four weeks after suffering a broken wrist in a domestic accident. Other than that Margy should have a full squad to choose from and there will possibly be a return to action for Matty Taylor.

The game is at Hurst Cross in Ashton on Saturday and is a 3pm kick off. Admission is pay on the gate and prices are 5 adults and 3 for senior citizens and under-16s. TheGrand August 8th, 2007, 12:44 PM Members Vote

As owners of the club, current members are invited to vote on the following three matters: A vote on gate prices for the following season, a vote on season ticket prices and a vote on the issue of league sponsor patches on our shirt.

Only current 2007/08 members can vote and all members can vote once and once only.

The closing date for voting is Tuesday 14 August 2007 at 3pm.


Gate prices 2007-2008

The board are recommending that adult gate prices be increased from 7 per match to 7.50 per match. It is the boards view that at a time of increased off-field costs and inflation, in order to aid stability and help the club progress, that an increase for adults paying at the gate is necessary.

However the board remains committed to our philosophy of providing affordable football and as such will always strive to keep prices at their lowest, rather than follow the all-too common practice throughout much of the rest of football of raising them as far as the market will sustain.

As such the board are recommending a 50p increase rather than anything higher. The board believes that as we enter our third season, this first ever increase is in keeping with those ideals.

As a further commitment to providing affordable football to those in most need, the board also recommends that under-18s gate prices remain at 2 per match and that OAPs and unwaged prices remain at 5 per match.

Season Ticket prices 2007-2008

Following the stunning response from supporters to the challenge set over the summer the board are recommending that season ticket prices be frozen. The challenge was that if a thousand sales could be reached by mid-July then prices would be frozen at the equivalent of 6 per match for adults, less than 4.50 for OAPs and the unwaged and only 1 per match for under-18s. As the challenge was met, then the recommendation from the board is an obvious one, however the final say will rest with the members and therefore the vote is included accordingly.

If supporters would like to take advantage of these considerable savings on gate prices, there is still time to do so.


UniBond Sleeve Patches

Rule 7.7 of the Unibond League requires that competing clubs wear a competition logo on the sleeve of their playing kit incorporating the name and logo of the league sponsor. In March 2006 at the General Meeting of FC United the membership carried resolution C which stated&quot;that no FC United of Manchester playing strip will carry shirt sponsorship&quot;. The League Management Committee have informed FC United that sanctions, financial or other, as a result of our refusal to wear the competition logo would be severe.

The board therefore requests direction on this matter for the coming season.

It is anticipated that this issue will be revisited at this years AGM for a formal resolution on the matter TheGrand August 15th, 2007, 02:35 PM Wednesday, August 08, 2007
Sealing Giggs swoop

Source: Tameside Advertiser

CURZON Ashton have moved quickly to snap up former Mossley winger Rhodri Giggs after he parted company with FC United on Monday.

Giggs (pictured) scored 15 goals in his 37 appearances during FCs title-winning campaign last season which saw them secure promotion into the UniBond League along with Curzon.

However, Giggs arrival was quickly followed by one player going through the exit door as the former Stalybridge Celtic and Hyde United defender Dave German departed the Tameside Stadium.

Curzon manager Gary Lowe said: When I heard Rhodri had parted company with FC, I knew that I would have to move quickly to secure his signature as I felt sure that there would be interest in him from a number of other clubs.

Not surprisingly we know a lot about Rhodri having come up against him as we did last season as well as watching him in one or two other games, and with a couple pre-season games to go before the season starts, hell obviously figure very heavily in those games.

Unfortunately it wasnt working out with Dave and so we both agreed that it would be best if we parted company now rather than later.

It gives him the chance to find another club and for us to find a replacement before the kick-off to the season. We wish him well.

Curzon, who lost 2-0 at UniBond South newcomers Quorn last weekend, come up against Sheffield FC at the Tameside Stadium with the visitors who won last seasons Northern Counties East League Premier Division reputed to be the oldest club in football, formed almost 150 years ago in October 1857. The game kicks off at 2pm with admission 5 for adults and 2 concessions. TheGrand August 15th, 2007, 02:38 PM Thursday, August 09, 2007
Swarbrick and FC United ready for new challenge

Source: North West Evening Mail

BARROW footballer Dave Swarbrick is stepping up another level this season with his league-storming FC United of Manchester team.

The former Barrow AFC and Holker Old Boys attacking midfielder will line-up in Unibond League Division One North as the supporters spin-off team look to continue their march up the tiers of English football.

And Swarbrick is optimistic for both his own and his teams fortunes ahead of the new campaign.

Pre-season has gone really well. Its my first full pre-season in a while so Im feeling good, said the 23-year-old, who trains twice a week with the squad in the Manchester area.

The training has been really hard, but all the lads have naturally high levels of fitness.

Im confident in myself and the team are definitely confident.

We recently drew with a strong Kidderminster side and they are a Conference team.

FC United, formed in 2005 by supporters angry at Malcolm Glazers takeover of Manchster United, have shown well in their pre-season friendlies and Swarbrick believes that promotion is a realistic target.

Weve played friendlies against teams from higher divisions and weve coped well, said Swarbrick, whose 2006/07 season was disrupted by a knee problem which required an operation.

I think were capable of challenging for the title this season.

One player Swarbrick will not be lining up alongside this season is Rhodri Giggs brother of Ryan who was recently released by the Red Rebels and is rumoured to be joining rivals Curzon Ashton. The opening fixture in FC Uniteds league campaign is on Saturday, August 18 with a trip to Lancaster City. TheGrand August 15th, 2007, 02:40 PM Saturday, August 11, 2007
This year I&apos;ll ride the snake like a soccer shaman
By Russell Brand

Edited from: Guardian Sport Blogs

When caught up in the magic of live football it&apos;s easy to believe that the power of the crowd is what ultimately matters; the inherent unity feels like socialism but each of the screaming 34,000 has been taxed on entry and however loud they may sound their voices are seldom heard. It is apparently futile to resist progress although tiny victories are occasionally achieved: disenchanted Manchester United fans have established FC United, a collectively financed club that truly belongs to its supporters. Presumably, though, were the club to clamber through the multitude of leagues to penetrate the national consciousness and challenge for trinkets the inevitable tide would also consume this idealistic vessel.

United start life in the UniBond

The new season in the UniBond Division One North finally begins this Saturday as FC United travel to Lancaster City to start the quest towards achieving an extraordinary three successive league titles. Craig Phillips provides this preview

After consecutive titles and promotions in the first two seasons many supporters and curious onlookers may be forgiven for expecting the same success this season for the Reds. What we have to consider though is some of the clubs United will face this year are vastly experienced and should provide a much sterner challenge than the North West Counties.

Theres no doubt that United will be the main attraction due to our army of supporters, however rival clubs will definitely be doing their best to make sure that the Reds dont have it all their own way on the pitch and they certainly wont be happy to let the new boys show up and storm their way through the league. One thing is for sure - the season will be full of highs and lows once more.

There have been a few changes on the playing side of things, with a few players going and few coming in and manager Karl Marginson will be looking for the team to hit the ground running and get off to another good start like last seasons 12 match winning streak.

Defeats at Trafford and AFC Wimbledon and the sudden departure of Rhodri Giggs threatened to blot the pre-season campaign, however an impressive 4-1 victory over UniBond Premier outfit Ashton United on Saturday added nicely to the two wins at Studley, Blackpool Mechanics and the well earned draw at Kidderminster Harriers.

The Reds make their way to the Giant Axe in Lancaster for what will be the first of three league meetings against Lancaster City. If Saturday is seen as the beginning of a new chapter for United, then for their opponents it must be the dawn of a new era. Lancaster finished bottom of the Conference North last season with one point amid financial troubles and doubts over the future of the club. The club took the unprecedented step of asking for a double relegation due to financial reasons and were granted permission to do so.

On 25th June this year the club were taken over by Lancaster City FC Ltd and its felt the new ownership of the club can lead to a bright and successful future. Club chairman Ian Sharp was excited about not only Saturdays fixture, but the coming season this week when we spoke to him.

He said: We, at Lancaster City FC, are looking forward to our encounter on the 18th August, a curtain raiser to the 2007- 08 season, in what must be the match of the day in the Unibond Division One North. Our trials and tribulations of last season seem a distant past as we look forward to a new era.

&quot;In the close season, work on and off the field has been rather hectic to say the least. A new company was formed, plus a new board of directors, who with the help of a new commercial manager have transformed the financial affairs of the club. We will extend a warm welcome to the supporters, officials and players of FC United of Manchester and hope that your visit to the Giant Axe is a pleasant one.

Lancaster City were formed in 1905, known then as Lancaster Athletic Football Club, which changed to Lancaster Town in 1910. In 1937 they became known as City as the town was given city status. The club are affectionately known as The Dolly Blues due to their original shirts matching the colour of the old Dolly Blue washing tablets. Their home stadium is known as the Giant Axe, because when it was built it was part of a sports complex which from aerial viewing resembled the shape of an axe.

Dolly Blues manager, Barry Simpson has said that many of the young players that helped them during last season will be given their chance to show what they can do and hes also added old favourites Steve Skinner and Mark Thornley to the playing staff for the forthcoming season.

After such a traumatic and disappointing season it seems the football buzz is back in Lancaster and we hope Saturdays game will be as exciting as the enthusiasm around it.

Supporters are reminded that the game is pay on gate but are advised they purchase their tickets in advance to avoid congestion at the turnstiles. The ticket office will be open from 10am on Saturday morning and free parking will be offered at the stadium. Tickets are priced Adults 8 (seating) 6 (standing) and concessions 6 (seating) and 4 (standing). TheGrand August 16th, 2007, 01:33 PM 16 August - 6 Days To Go!

FACT 2: Former league teams who we may meet during our time in the Northern Premier League include Gateshead and Bradford Park Avenue.

Gateshead were originally based in South Shields but the club moved to Gateshead in 1930 in an attempt to draw more support. They were a league team from 1919 until they failed to secure enough votes for re-election in 1960.

The current Bradford PA side was re-formed in 1988, but the club originally existed as far back as 1863, and played league football from 1908 until 1970. They were in the First Division of the Football League as recently as 1921.

Channel M pulls the plug on FCUM.TV

Posted by mike box on August 16th, 2007
Despite a frantic round of last minute talks regarding next seasons FCUM.TV show, Channel m have unexpectedly pulled out of the deal citing exposure to legal challenges. This shock announcement comes after a positive round of negotiations between Channel m, Unibond Northern Premier League, InVision (who recently acquired the leagues filming rights), Box Productions and FC United - all of whom had verbally agreed a deal that resulted in lawyers being instructed to draw up contracts. But Channel m called time on these negotiations with the new season rapidly approaching.

Box productions Mike Kirwin says talks started late, .the delayed announcement of the league restructure left a shorter time frame to start and conclude a deal between the different organisations involved.

FC Uniteds general manager Andy Walsh explains we invested a lot of time and effort into obtaining agreements with InVision and Unibond and were confident that we had an understanding with them that would result in an enforceable written license to use the rights in a very short period of time.

Mike Kirwin continues, It is unfortunate that Channel M couldnt commit to allowing the time we needed to conclude the legal aggreements as we had reached a filming rights agreement with all concerned. But FC fans should rest assured that we are working hard to find ways of continuing our FCUM.TV service at www.fcum.tv. TheGrand August 16th, 2007, 09:54 PM Striker blow for FC United
Stuart Brennan
15/ 8/2007

RORY Patterson is set to miss eight FC United matches next month after being reported for a red card during a pre-season friendly.

The Rebels&apos; star striker, named as non-league Young Player of the Year last season, has picked up a 35-day suspension for&quot;violent conduct&quot;during the 2-1 defeat by Trafford two weeks ago.

The club is planning to appeal but, unless they are successful, the ban is expected to start on September 5 which means Patterson would miss a big FA Cup clash with Fleetwood Town should FC battle through their preliminary round tie against either Atherton LR or Trafford.

News of the ban for Patterson, who has scored 58 goals in 78 games for FC, is a third big blow to the club just days ahead of their debut in the UniBond League when they travel to play Lancaster City on Saturday.

The club has lost last season&apos;s top scorer, Stuart Rudd, for the opening three weeks of the season with a broken hand, although a special cast may allow him to return before Patterson&apos;s ban kicks in.

And Rhodri Giggs, who would have partnered Patterson up front, has left the club for Curzon Ashton following a dispute with manager Karl Marginson after the player turned up late for the pre-season friendly at AFC Wimbledon.

That means new boy Anthony Hargreaves, a former Flixton and Cammell Laird striker, is expected to make his FC debut at Lancaster.

Meanwhile, many fans will have fond memories of Clitheroe, where FC United were playing a friendly when our first ever league title was clinched.

Whether we play all our away games at the host clubs own grounds remains to be seen. However, if we do then the largest ground that we shall be visiting will be that of Newcastle Blue Star with a stated capacity of 10000 (Newcastle Blue Star share the Kingston Park stadium with the Newcastle Falcons Rugby Union team).

Yorkshires Brazil come to town

FC United will be hoping to bounce straight back from the disappointment of suffering a 2-1 opening day defeat to Lancaster City on Wednesday night when they take on West Yorkshires Brazilian-influenced Garforth Town at Gigg Lane in the first home game of the season.

Garforth are a club with real ambitions though and they will look to spoil the night for the Reds by building on Saturdays 2-1 victory over Mossley in front of 237 supporters, the divisions third highest attendance of the day.

This is Garforths first season in the UniBond League having been promoted under the re-structuring after finishing fourth last season in the Northern Counties East League.

The club is well known for being able to claim Lee Sharpe and Brazilian international Socrates and Careca as former players and has been hitting the headlines since Simon Clifford bought the club during the 2003 season. When he bought the club he eliminated its previous 100,000 debts and made it clear that he had strong ambitions for the future with hopes of climbing up the league pyramid.

Clifford is well regarded in the football industry and is known for his strong connections to Brazilian football; he has brought Brazilian coaching methods to the United Kingdom with his string of ICFDS (International Confederation of Futebol de Sal footballing academies. The programme, like Cliffords Brazilian Soccer Schools, is running throughout the UK. Theo Walcott and Micah Richards are players who have both graduated from Simon Cliffords BSS system.

Despite the Yorkshire clubs low level in terms of leagues, they gained massive press attention at the start of the 2004/05 season with the signing of Brazil legend Socrates on a one month deal as a player-coach and he played for Garforth against Tadcaster Albion. The same season, former England and Manchester United winger Lee Sharpe also played for the club. Another former Brazil international, Careca, came out of retirement and spent time at the club during the 2005/06 season.

Though these players have now been and gone they were indicative of Garforths intentions and the clubs general manager, George Williams is excited about the prospect of life in the UniBond League. He said: Like FC United, we have been promoted a couple of times in the last few seasons.

We have not played any of the UniBond Divison One North teams before, as the other promoted NCEL teams were placed in the Southern section. However, we will be looking to establish ourselves and it will be great to see some of the ICFDS graduates included in the squad.

23/ 8/2007

RETURNING FC United striker Stuart Rudd was sent-off as his side&apos;s poor start to the season continued with defeat at the hands of Garforth Town.

The Reds hit the bar and had a goal disallowed for off-side in the final minute but the visitors hung on for victory in front of 2,216 fans at Gigg Lane.

Before his sending off, following an innocuous-looking incident, Rudd had already headed wide just after half-time and then fired past the post soon afterwards.

But as the rebel Reds pressed forward in search of an opening goal, the visitors suddenly broke away and midfielder Chris Kamara netted from close-range to the delight of the 60 strong travelling army.

FC United substitute Chris Bagguley fired a 30 yard free-kick just wide as the Reds went in search of an equaliser and Rob Nugent then hit the bar with a header before Simon Carden&apos;s strike was ruled out in the last minute.

However, despite that pressure the visitors held on and the result leaves FC pointless after two games. TheGrand August 24th, 2007, 05:48 PM Reds hungry for victory

Manager Karl Marginson still has every confidence in his squad of players and says they are champing at the bit to get a first victory of the new season under their belts this Saturday against Bridlington Town at Gigg Lane.

Rory Patterson may feature in the action as his foot is just badly bruised rather than broken, Stuart Rudd will be available and Simon Carden may be recalled to the starting line up after impressing as a substitute against both Lancaster City and Garforth Town.

Margy said: Well wait and see with Rory how bad the pain is, but it isnt broken so thats really good news. Stuarts fine and well see what the referee has put in his report (about Wednesdays red card) before deciding whether to appeal. Simon is definitely pushing for a start and hes ready for it. Hes adamant that he was on-side on Wednesday for the goal and he was unlucky not to score against with that volley against Lancaster.

Margy has also been very impressed with former Oldham Athletic midfielder, Chris Baguley. He said: Chris situation is pretty similar to Nicky Platt in that it took Nicky a few weeks to settle in last season, but once he did he put in some tremendous performances at the back end of last season. Thats the road we want to go down with Chris.

Speaking about the 19-year-olds free-kick which curled just past the post on Wednesday, Margy added: That shows a lot of character; to come on as a substitute with your team one-nil down and to take that free-kick with ten minutes to go. Were very lucky to have Chris - hes going to be a real belter.

And despite the two defeats Margy has been reasonably pleased with the way his side has performed and doesnt see the need for bringing in new personnel. He said: Im sticking to what I said at the start of the season; weve got the players to do the business. Ive heard the opinion that we need a meathead in the middle why? I want footballers who can pass the ball and not be bullied. I dont think we were bullied on Wednesday night, their players got away with a few things, but we werent bullied.

Well match fire with fire when we need to but until then well carry on playing football, thats the United way and thats what Ive been brought up, so were not going to change it. In both games weve created enough chances, weve not really carved anyone open yet but that will come. I think someones going to be on the end of a hiding very soon.

Live match commentary from 2.45 on the radio section of www.fcum.tv TheGrand August 27th, 2007, 11:12 AM The joy of six kickstarts Reds&apos; season

With Manchester United and FC United going five games without a win between them, Reds havent had a lot to cheer about recently, but it was a case of The Joy of Six as FC United blitzed Bridlington Town 6-0 on Saturday.

Rory Patterson scored four with Anthony Hargreaves and a Matty Taylor penalty completing the rout in front of a crowd of 2,253.

The Gigg Lane PA blasted out 24 Hour Party People before the match and the raucous home support witnessed an impressive United performance.

The Reds flew at Bridlington like a boxer at the sound of the opening bell and dominated the early stages without translating their possession into goals.

That changed on 15 minutes. Jerome Wright played a well-designed pass through to Rory Patterson. He chested it down and turned before lashing the ball into the back of the net.

He made it two seven minutes later with a composed finish from a lofted through ball from Rob Nugent. Almost midway through the second half, Patterson made sure the match ball was his after he converted Stuart Rudds fizzing cross.

Shortly afterwards, he made it four. The industrious and classy Jerome Wright sent in a cross from the left which Patterson bundled across the line.

Outside of Patterson, Wright was Uniteds outstanding performer. Playing on the left-wing, he linked up well with full-back Shaun Roscoe. The majority of Uniteds attacks emanated from this side of the pitch and he was
a constant threat throughout.

The fifth goal was the pick of the bunch - incisive, fluid, counter-attacking football culminating in a well-taken goal for substitute Anthony Hargreaves - his first for the club.

The move was as quick as it was deadly and a welcome
riposte to anybody who doubted these players could make the step up to the UniBond.

In the 87th minute, Matty Taylor - who combined a solid defensive performance with some threatening forays down the right wing - scored a penalty.

Bridlington were hit for six and the scoreline reflected Uniteds dominance. Comfortably the better team, they effortlessly repelled any Bridlington attacks and always looked in control.

Manager Karl Marginson claimed in the week that someone would be on the end of a hiding very soon and how right he was. He can be pleased with six goals, three points and a clean sheet while the 24-Hour Party People look forward to Mondays Bank Holiday game against Rossendale. The boys are back in town. And how.

Rossendale ready for Reds

The August Bank Holiday represents a great day on the football calendar and for FC United thats no exception. The Reds make the short trip to Rossendale United on Monday fully aware they need to get some points on the board to get the season started. Craig Phillips provides this preview

Manager Karl Marginson wont be overly concerned about the points situation at the moment as his team have shown they are definitely not out of their depth in the UniBond Division One North through their performances against Lancaster City and Garforth Town.

United will be without Rory Patterson who begins the first of a three match suspension after being sent off against Trafford in the pre-season friendly, but Stuart Rudd will be eager to open his account this season after scoring no fewer than 45 last season.

The Stags, as Rosendale are known, have made a good start to the season. They opened with a good 1-0 victory at home to Harrogate Railway last Saturday before coming from behind in midweek to take a 2-1 victory away from Radcliffe Borough. They will be looking on improving on last seasons ninth position in the league and many at the club felt they could have reached the playoffs last year if it wasnt for a slight drop in form in February and March.

The Lancashire outfit were initially formed in 1898 and were founder members of the North West Counties Football League back in 1982. They enjoyed two good FA Cup runs in the 1970s, making the second round proper in 1972, before losing 2-1 to Bolton Wanderers at Gigg Lane.

The Stags fell on hard times in the mid-90s and it looked like time had been called on their long history, but under new ownership in the centenary season the club began something of a renaissance. They won the NWCFL Division One in 2001, and have found themselves pushing for playoff spots in this league for the past two seasons.

Mondays games will be accompanied by a host of fun activities and entertainment at the ground. Stags chairman Steve Hobson said: We are looking forward to the game on Bank Holiday Monday and are set to offer the player, officials and supporters of FC United of Manchester a right old Rossy welcome - apart from 90 minutes on the pitch.

We have an Irish band on from noon and a barbeque, speed shot, beat the goalie and laser shot, all to entertain the crowd and create a fan friendly atmosphere. And of course let us not forget for those amongst us with a taste for real ale Moorhouses Pendle Witch. Im told nectar to the more discerning beer drinkers palate.

Hobson also spoke of the clubs ambitions for the coming season, saying: The players loyalty to the club and, of course, manager Derek Egan cannot be brought into question. Most of last seasons team have returned for the coming campaign and we welcome several new faces who we hope will settle in quickly. All in all cause for optimism this season.

Supporters are reminded the game is all ticket and tickets can be purchased before Saturdays game at home to Bridlington. Tickets are priced Adults 10 (seating) 8 (standing) and Concessions 7 (seating) and 5 (standing). Kick off is the usual 3pm. TheGrand August 28th, 2007, 12:27 PM Rossendale 1 FC United 2

FC UNITED had striker Stuart Rudd to thank for their second successive victory as they won 2-1 away at Rossendale.

The big number nine scored one and won the penalty for the second as FC triumphed in the UniBond First Division North clash.

A bumper bank holiday crowd of 2,023 at Dark Lane saw Rudd crack in a 25-yard free-kick before the home side equalised before the break through Mark Drew.

But Rudd was impeded in the box with 10 minutes left and Nicky Platt put the penalty away to make it two wins from four games for United. TheGrand August 28th, 2007, 12:31 PM http://fcumfiles.co.uk/images/traffordfa.jpg

Reds on the road to Wembley

FC United make their debut, and hopefully kick off their inaugural campaign, in the oldest cup competition in the world when they meet local rivals Trafford at Altrinchams Moss Lane on Sunday in the Preliminary Round. Craig Phillips provides this preview

The Reds kick started their season over the weekend with a 6-0 win at home to Bridlington on Saturday with four goals from Rory Patterson, one from Anthony Hargreaves and a penalty from Matty Taylor. On Monday, they picked up their second win in three days with a hard earned 2-1 away win over Rossendale United, goals coming from Stuart Rudd and a Nicky Platt penalty.

United will of course be without Rory Patterson for the game who serves the second match of his three game ban but all the other players should be fit and available for selection.

In three meetings with Trafford each team has a win and there was the memorable 4-4 draw at the end of last season at Gigg Lane, in which former FC United captain Bill McCartney equalised with a late penalty for to cap a remarkable comeback for the visitors who had been trailing 4-1.

When the two met at Moss Lane last season United took home a 1-0 win with a Steve Smith goal. But in the most recent clash in pre-season this year Trafford took a 2-1 win as Uniteds Rory Patterson was sent off.

Most fans will know about Trafford by now due to last seasons encounters with them. United manger Karl Marginson believes that the familiarity of Sundays opponents should be a good thing, saying: We know all about Trafford so well go into that one with plenty of confidence. With the up most respect to them, we should be able to win that.

The match will be Traffords second in this seasons FA Cup, after they beat Atherton LR 1-0 in the extra preliminary round. This season theyre currently unbeaten in all competitions, and are occupying third place in the North West Counties Division One; just behind Flixton and Ramsbottom United.

After drawing their opening fixture 1-1 at home to Nelson, they went to Congleton and got a good 2-2 draw, before giving Bacup Borough a 3-1 beating. Last weekend they hosted newly promoted Runcorn Linets and came away 2-1 winners with an 87th minute winner.

Non-league teams have strived to try and make the competition proper and cause some giant killing. Although no team from the UniBond Division One last season made it past the third preliminary round last season.

The winner of the Sundays game has an away trip to Fleetwood to look forward to in two weeks time. If we dare look that far ahead, there could be another day out by the seaside.

Supporters are reminded that the game is to be held at Altrincham FCs Moss Lane ground and is pay on gate with admission prices at 7 adults and 4 concessions. Kick off is the usual 3pm.

A little moment of history will be made this weekend in the North West of England.

The vast majority of attention in Manchester will be focused on Roy Keanes return to Old Trafford with his Sunderland side on Saturday night.

But almost a day later, and a few miles away, FC United will be playing Trafford FC at Moss Lane.

And why is this significant, you ask? Because it will mark FC Uniteds debut in the FA Cup, the worlds oldest cup competition and the trophy Manchester United have won 11 times.

It may only be the preliminary round of the competition almost, but not quite, as early as you can embark on the road to Wembley. But it marks another milestone for the little club born two years ago, and forged out of protest and anger.

Victory at this stage of the competition is worth 1000 to a club nothing if youre the Premiership champions, but a hell of a lot to sides further down the pyramid.

At this level of the cup, the names may be unfamiliar but the stories arent. London ASPA won their extra preliminary replay against Sporting Bengal last week making them the first Asian team to make the preliminary round.

For the sides taking part in this weekends fixtures, theyre just 11 rounds away from the final.

Both teams were founded from passion and a disenfranchised community be it at the semi-pro level, as players wanting to be a standard bearer for Asian football in the UK, or at the top of the Premier League, left out in the cold by Uniteds takeover by the Glazer family and the direction of the club.

And both now find themselves, like around 600 others, on the road to Wembley.

Forget all the hype, all the media glitz and glamour. Thats the real magic of the FA Cup. TheGrand September 4th, 2007, 02:49 PM Firstly from The Torygraph, then from The Times

FC United to rekindle history after FA Cup win

Source: Telegraph.co.uk

By Ricky George

It may have been a Manchester Derby with a difference, but for sheer excitement and some spectacular finishing, yesterday&apos;s FA Cup Preliminary Round tie between Trafford and FC United of Manchester would have graced Old Trafford itself. The two non-league sides - Trafford play in the Vodkat NW Counties League whilst United have climbed to the Unibond Division One North on level four of the pyramid - produced a thrilling and combative encounter at Altrincham&apos;s Moss Lane stadium.

In beating their local rivals 5-2, the breakaway fans&apos; club, playing in their first ever FA Cup match, earned the right to play Fleetwood Town in the First Qualifying Round of the competition.

Over a century ago, the fledgling Newton Heath FC (who became Manchester United in 1902) entered the FA Cup for the first time against the very same opponents. Football does occasionally throw up strange coincidences, this one almost defies belief.

It is only two years since a group of disenchanted Manchester United supporters abandoned their beloved side in protest against the sale of the club to the Glazer family.

On the premise that membership of the new club would attract a minimum of 1000 fans, the organisers, in receipt of four times that figure, moved in to share League Two Bury&apos;s Gigg Lane stadium. FC United quickly won successive championships, playing to average crowds of nearly 3000.

They could have been 3-0 up inside the first 10 minutes, but took the lead a minute later following Josh Howard&apos;s corner; central defender Rob Nugent thumping home a header from just inside the penalty area.

Howard, a former Manchester United youth player, made it 2-0 from close range shortly after. In front of a huge home attendance of 2,238, Chris Mackay reduced the arrears with a delicate chip as Trafford battled their way back into contention. They deservedly levelled the scores when Andy Lundy forced his way through.

It was fast and furious as FC United went back in front a minute before half-time when Nicky Platt converted a penalty following a Trafford handball in the box. The pace dropped in the second half as FC United resumed control, Simon Carden restoring their two-goal advantage with 21 minutes left.

Fittingly, in the final minute, a player named Hargreaves (Anthony) topped off the performance with the fifth and final goal, leaving FCUM with just six more rounds to play before entering the draw alongside their Almer Mater.

&quot;It&apos;s a FCUM Love thang&quot;read one of many banners around Moss Lane.&quot;Making friends not millionaires&quot;, said another.

The other Uniteds Cup dream begins

Mark Venables

FC United of Manchester made their debut in the oldest cup competition in the world yesterday when they defeated local rivals Trafford FC 5-2 at Moss Lane, the home of Altrincham, in the preliminary round of the FA Cup.

After the Malcolm Glazer takeover at Old Trafford, a group of Manchester United supporters undertook to reject the corporate megalith that their club had become and thus FC United were born. Now in their third season, that workers revolution mentality remains, with directors preferring the local hostelry to the board room at their Gigg Lane base for entertaining visiting teams directors. The tone of the club is perfectly summed up by a banner hung behind the goal proclaiming FCUM, making friends not millionaires.

FC United rose from the North West Counties league to a berth in the UniBond League northern division, four promotions away from Football League status. After two seasons during which they barely suffered defeat, they opened this campaign with two losses, but normal service was resumed with two victories, including a six-goal mauling of Bridlington Town.

Roared on by the bulk of the 2,238 crowd, FC United raced in to a two-goal lead courtesy of a powerful header from Rob Nugent and a close-range shot on the turn from Josh Howard.

United relaxed and allowed Trafford to restore parity through Chris Mackay and Andy Lundy, but, just before the interval, they were in front again with a penalty from Nicky Platt. Simon Carden added a fourth midway through the second half before Anthony Hargreaves concluded the scoring.

Next stop is a trip to Fleetwood, the venue for the first FA Cup tie played by Newton Heath, Manchester Uniteds predecessors, in two weeks.

More cup action for United

With three wins out of the last three, FC United now turn their attentions to the UniBond Challenge Cup on Wednesday night against Division One South side Alsager Town at a home tie that will be staged at Radcliffe Borough. John Freeman provides this preview

Nicknamed The Bullets, Alsager were promoted to the UniBond league in 2006 from the NWCFL after finishing third behind Cammell Laird and Skelmersdale United. Last season, their first in the UniBond, Alsager finished in a comfortable mid-table position and they have made a cracking start to this season, winning their first three league matches.

The merger of Alsager Institute and Alsager United formed Alsager AFC in 1965. The merger came about due to the lack of pitches in the village. They acquired the Wood Park facility in 1967 that was then seeded ready for the following season, where it was first played on in 1968/69.

By Christmas 1998 the club decided that they would apply for the North West Counties League. Alsager AFC successfully passed the criteria necessary to gain entry and a second place in the Springbank Vending League was enough to gain promotion. Their first season in the football pyramid system got off to a great start as early form took them to the top of the league well into September. Good cup runs also followed with Alsager reaching the semi-final of the NWCFL Second Division Trophy, where they were beaten over two legs by Tetley Walker and they also reached the quarterfinals of the NWCFL Cup, where they forced first division title contenders Mossley to a replay. The Bullets made a creditable 12th spot in their first season, improving to 7th in their second season.

Alsager were promoted from the NWCFL Division Two in the 2001/02 season after finishing runners-up to Stand Athletic and subsequently enjoyed a good first season in the first division. They had another good season in 2005/2006, keeping place with Cammell Laird and Skelmersdale throughout, and as the league structure was to change yet again Alsager gained promotion to the UniBond League along with the Lairds and Skem.

The clubs player-manager is Dean Stokes. A former Port Vale and Rochdale professional, who once marked Italian striker Vincent Montella at Wembley, Dean is looking to build on last seasons showing. Dean and Assistant Manager, Richard Mitchell, have been in charge since January.

The UniBond is a tough league, you have to raise your game for every match. I think the South and North Divisions are evenly matched. We have some new players, who will need time to adapt but we are quietly confident that we can improve on last season, said Dean.

On Wednesdays match, Dean offered a the hint of an off-field competition: Alsager have a small but hard-core set of supporters. They will be looking to match the FC fans in the vocal stakes it should create a good atmosphere. As for the match, he simply added: It is just another game for us we play to win!

MUSIC and football are natural bedfellows, with one culture inevitably feeding off the other and a new afternoon event arranged by FC United brings the two closer than ever.

Course You Can Malcolm is a pre-match entertainment spectacular laid on at Gigg Lane prior to home games at the club formed in response to the Glazer’s Manchester United takeover.

After a trial run with Chorlton’s Little Engine a few weeks ago the series continues with a visit by akoustik anarkhy’s latest discoveries LA Pals this Saturday prior to the fixture with Woodley Sports.

Each band selected will have only 22 minutes to impress what promises to be a packed crowd every week, that’s one minute for every player taking to the pitch.

Chief organiser Rob Brady said“After two seasons, and football issues sorting themselves out very nicely on the pitch, it’s time to sort out the other important matters. Your loved ones, friends, beer, music and football should always go together.

&quot;We now have an opportunity to make it so.”

The first gig was raucously well-received with entry to the gigs being free to anyone paying into the ground for the game along with a club membership. Doors open at 1pm and if you don’t hold a membership you can obtain one on the day.

As rock and roll and sport collide, nobody is expecting the experience to be too healthy and there’s the promise of cheap food and a fully stocked bar to complete the experience of seeing some of Manchester’s brightest new talents on and off the pitch. TheGrand October 14th, 2007, 10:36 AM Rebels sign ex-Reds hotshot

11/10/2007

FC UNITED crashed out of the FA Trophy on Wednesday night - but announced news of a remarkable new signing.

The Rebels suffered a record 4-1 home defeat to Bradford Park Avenue but completed the capture of last season&apos;s Manchester United reserve team top scorer Aaron Burns.

The 19-year-old striker was released by Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer and joined Championship side Cardiff, only to be edged out by the signings of Robbie Fowler and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

But a contractual restriction means Burns cannot play for a club above UniBond League level until the January transfer window, so FC have stepped in to pick him up until then.

That was a much-needed boost for FC fans who have this week lost last season&apos;s top scorer Stuart Rudd with a knee injury which could keep him out for the season.

They had to suffer again as Park Avenue produced a fine display.

The visitors took the lead at Radcliffe Borough when a defensive mix-up allowed centre forward Paul Gedman in for an easy finish.

As FC pushed for an equaliser they were blitzed on the counter-attack and Liam Flynn, Gedman again and sub Mike Moseley worsened the agony before Cayne Handley rifled in his first FC goal. TheGrand October 14th, 2007, 10:39 AM FC Feature in Futsal

F C Uniteds youth team will be taking part in the Manchester County Football Association Futsal League.

Futsal is an indoor version of the game played between two teams of five players including a keeper with each team able to use substitutes. One notable difference is that a Futsal ball is slightly heavier and smaller than the size 5 ball used in regular football. The size and weight of the ball dictates that a player takes more touches leading to improvements in individual skills and technique.

Futsal is relatively new to this country but has been played in Brazil from a number of years with the name Futsal derived from the Portuguese phrase for indoor football. FC old boy Steve Torpey had trials for the England national team whilst at the club.

The league will take place on Monday nights at Salford Sports Village the club will publish fixtures when available.

The development has been welcomed by F C United Manager Karl Marginson said This is a fantastic opportunity for the young players at the club to experience this exciting new game. It is accepted by almost everybody in Football that futsal really does help in the development of close control and speed of footwork.

F C under 18s manager Chris Simms is equally enthusiastic adding The chance for these lads to compete in this league can only be good for there football development, it will give them the opportunity to compete against teams who are more experienced at this form of the game, everybody is looking forward to it. heatonparkincakes October 18th, 2007, 02:18 PM Grand, I believe some talk is about to happen at the Club&apos;s AGM about a new ground.

By the way, I may have asked you this before, you what is your stance of where a FC United ground should be?

THERE was no floodlight failure for Clitheroe to answer to on Tuesday night, just a strong, well organised FC United of Manchester and defeat in front of an 800-strong crowd.

The Blues had no solution to the visitors&apos; three goals despite having numerous half chances in the opening 45 minutes and an array of shots go wide of the mark.

In fact Clitheroe struggled to hit the target, even though they had plenty of opportunity around the United box to level before the break thanks to former Rossendale striker Neil Zarac making his debut alongside Gary Jackson.

It proved a tale of two strikers in the end, and it certainly didn&apos;t help that FC United were quick out of the blocks thanks to former Manchester United reserves top scorer Aaron Burns also making his debut.

The 19-year-old striker was picked up in the close season by Cardiff City having been released by Alex Ferguson in the summer, but Robbie Fowler and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbank have left him out in the cold.

So FCUM took advantage of FA rules, which dictate he can&apos;t play above UniBond League level until the transfer window re-opens, due to contractual restrictions preventing him from moving on to a league club before January.

Clitheroe were left to bare the brunt of this remarkable signing with a goal in each half from the eager striker, either side of a Rory Patterson penalty.

Captain Patterson was equally as impressive for the visitors as he put Burns in for his first strike inside the first 10 minutes.

And after being pulled down by Kieron Fletcher in the second half, he netted from the spot to put United 2-0 up.

Clitheroe went to three at the back as a result, bringing on a third striker in Sam Heap for Adam Koslowski, only to see a mistake let Jerome Wright in down the left wing to craft a cross for Burns to volley home United&apos;s third at the near post.

Zarac and Heap saw further chances in the box closed out by the visitors&apos; defence and further shots from distance by Craig Sargeson went over the bar. A goal just wouldn&apos;t fall, as even when Will Exton replaced Jackson near the end, it just wasn&apos;t Clitheroe&apos;s night.

Clitheroe: Mann, J. Osborne, Koslowski (Heap), Fletcher, Clarke, Fisher, Sargeson, P. Osborne, Jackson (Exton), Byrom, Zarac.

Labels: Clitheroe Advertiser TheGrand October 24th, 2007, 11:06 PM FC UNITED showed no mercy for a makeshift Droylsden side as they dumped the holders out of the Manchester Premier Cup at the Butcher&apos;s Arms.

Bloods boss Dave Pace carried out his threat to rest several first-team regulars, including skipper Steve Halford and strike duo Jody Banim and Chris Denham, ahead of Saturday&apos;s big FA Cup fourth qualifying-round clash at Corby.

And FC, who play three divisions below Droylsden, seized on that advantage over their struggling Blue Square Premier hosts to record a famous victory.

Cayne Hanley gave the Rebels a head-start when he rose above the Droylsden defence in the 12th minute to nod in Jerome Wright&apos;s cross.

And the tie was effectively settled when the visitors struck twice in a minute just before the hour to leave the Bloods trailing 3-0.

Nicky Platt was the architect on each occasion, first sending Aaron Burns clear to score and then starting the move which culminated in Burns squaring for Rory Patterson to add FC&apos;s third.

Gavin Salmon pulled one back in the 72nd minute, firing home from Robbie Talbot&apos;s cross.

Terry Fearns further reduced the arrears with a 90th-minute penalty, but it was too late.

Burns looks to fire up Rebels

26/10/2007

AARON BURNS, the ex-Manchester United starlet, will be bidding to catapult his new club FC United into second spot on Saturday.

The former Old Trafford reserve released by Cardiff has already notched three goals in two starts for the Rebels. And he is in line to make his home debut for Karl Marginson&apos;s side, currently in fourth spot, who play second-placed Ossett Albion.

Marginson said today:&quot;It&apos;s a chance to leapfrog Ossett and put pressure on the leaders Curzon Ashton.

&quot;We have hit top form now after a sticky patch and with new signings such as Aaron the team has been reinvigorated.&quot;

FC UNITED recovered from a nightmare start to leapfrog Ossett Albion into second place in UniBond division one north.

Shane Kelsey stunned the Rebels as he ghosted in behind their defence to side-foot Ossett in front after just 35 seconds.

And it took a slice of good fortune to get Karl Marginson&apos;s men back on terms in the 40th minute when Chris Baguley&apos;s blocked shot hit Rory Patterson on the side of the head and went in.

Patterson squeezed in his 15th goal of the season to give FC an advantage they rarely looked like conceding and Peter Thomson added the third.

FC UNITED&apos;S bid to build their own stadium has received a major boost from Manchester City Council.

The Rebels, who hope to have their own home within five years, have been commended for their&quot;vision&quot;by the council, which is now trying to find a site for a 5,000-capacity ground.

FC general manager Andy Walsh and board member Adam Brown recently met leader of the council Sir Richard Leese and town hall officers to discuss ways forward for the club formed by dis- affected Manchester United supporters in 2005.

And Sir Richard told the recent conference of Supporters Direct - the government body set up to give football fans a greater say in the running of their clubs - that,&quot;we were really convinced by the vision that FC United set out.&quot;

Important

The importance of building their own ground was laid bare at FC&apos;s annual meeting at the weekend, when it was revealed that the club lost 40,000 in the last financial year.

Attendances have dropped since the club&apos;s inaugural season, despite two successive promotions and the fact that the Rebels are now riding high in the UniBond League&apos;s first division north.

But the club now has a hard-core support of around 2,200, and believe they can only start to fulfil their dream of becoming a community club once they get their own ground after three seasons of sharing with Bury.

The ground-share has been a big drain on resources, to the point that some home cup games - like tomorrow night&apos;s President&apos;s Cup clash with Bamber Bridge - have been switched to Radcliffe Borough&apos;s cheaper stadium.

Outlining plans for a new stadium at the club&apos;s meeting, Brown said:&quot;Absolutely essential to what we are trying to do is the community approach of this football club.

Access

&quot;We are renting a ground and have access to it only when there is a match on, which means we don&apos;t have a base from which to work and that all the income we get is not being re-invested in the club but is going out to other organisations such as Bury Football Club.

&quot;We have a very clear rationale. Any money that comes into the club needs to be reinvested into the club, and we can&apos;t fulfil our ambitions of being a community club if we are constantly nomadic.&quot;

As to the 40,000 loss, Walsh explained:&quot;In our first year we had a surplus and decided we would employ a club development officer as we needed to show community funders that we were serious.

&quot;We also wanted to set up reserve and youth teams and all of those things cost us 75,000 which, with grant funding, came down to about 60,000.

&quot;A significant part of our outgoings are matchday operating costs which are far in excess of those faced by other clubs at our level because we play at such a large ground and need to employ 40 staff. But we still expect to hit something like break even for the current year.&quot;

The board kept reiterating that this is all rough at the minute, and not concrete

The board have been working closely with a Manchester based architect who has experience in this field. The vision at the moment is this......

- A 5,000 capacity stadium, 3/4 terracing
- Oval Shaped sunk into the ground to lessen environmental impact, looked top by the way if we could pull that off we will have seriously outdone ourselves
- Ground to be part of a mixed use development to cater for community needs, models of such builds; Leyton Orient, Warrington and Telford
- Education fascilities for all ages (possibly linked to MANCAT)
- All weather pitches for community use, including for local schools
- Function Rooms for community use as well as club use.
- Health Fascilities for the community.
- All Week access

- Looking at a 6.5 acre site
- Land value for such a plot close to the city centre = 30 million pound, so out of the question of playing in Piccadilly Gardens.
- Estimated value of stadium without land = 8 million pound
- Board confident that it can get to 4 million with asistance from other parties and partners.
- 4 million shortfall and land value not resolved yet, however developers can apply for grants if community aspects of a new build are catered for, so there are other means.

Good working relationship already developed with Manchester and Salford City Councils, as well as Tameside and Trafford with regards to FCs community work and ventures

Contact made with Manchester City Council with regards to the ground, as Mr Brennan has said. Similar talks to start with Salford City Council and Trafford in coming weeks.

Quote from one senior figure - Its nice to see a football club saying all these things about community and actually fullfilling them.

Cup clash with promotion rivals

With four wins out of the last four and 11 goals to boot, FC United will go into Wednesdays Presidents Cup encounter at Radcliffe Borough against Bamber Bridge full of confidence and looking to test themselves against another promotion contending team.

Although the Presidents Cup may not be as prestigious as some of the other knock-out competitions, it is still a coveted prize for clubs in the UniBond Football League and has been established since the 1981/82 season with some of the big names of nonleague football winning it in the past including Stalybridge Celtic, Droylsden and even Macclesfield Town.

The Bamber boys even won it themselves as recently as 2005 so they know how it feels to go all the way and they will certainly be eager to advance to the next round whilst putting one over the Reds just two weeks before the sides meet for the first of three scheduled league matches on 17th November.

The Brig have been in fine form in the early part of this season, being in the play-off zone right from the off with Ryan Salmon in particular banging the goals in. However, their last two outings have not lived up to that. They were unceremoniously dumped out of the FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round at the weekend 4-1, although it should be noted their opponents, Histon are riding high in the Blue Square Premier League. What will be of more concern to Bamber is the way they buckled at home to midtable Harrogate Railway Athletic the week before, by two unanswered goals.

Despite the possible dip in form, manager Phil Entwistle is more than happy with the way the season is going, in particular how his fledging team have started to mature into possible promotion contenders. He said: This set of lads has been together for about three years. They came to us from clubs such as Morecambe and Burnley as 17-year-olds. Nonleague was tough for them to start with, but they are stronger now and are producing performances consistently.

Phil is a self confessed Manchester City fan but holds no grudges FC United and in fact was very complimentary about the club and its ethos. Thinking ahead to the first league encounter two weeks on Saturday, he said: Bamber Bridge is a good family club and we will welcome FC United. I have spoken to people from Padiham and Colne who told me what great memories they have from your visits. Every football club should be run like FC United.

FC United versus Bamber Bridge is this Wednesday at Radcliffe Borough, kick off 7.45pm. Its pay on the gate with admission fees at 6 for adults and 2 concessions. Get yourself to that football ground. TheGrand November 3rd, 2007, 11:45 AM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMc5ifO4wDY

You heard the man :lol: TheGrand November 3rd, 2007, 11:48 AM Rebels go goal-happy

1/11/2007

GOAL-happy FC United gave Bamber Bridge the Hallowe&apos;en horrors as they ended their cup hoodoo with a 5-0 victory at Radcliffe last night.

Young midfielders Chris Baguley and Jerome Wright led the rout, giving Bamber a torrid time in a scintillating first-half of the UniBond League&apos;s President&apos;s Cup clash.

They were both hauled off by manager Karl Marginson, in an almost sympathetic substitution early in the second-half after helping the Rebels open up a five-goal lead.

FC went into the game on the back of four straight wins and hoped to put down a marker for the league clash with fellow promotion contenders Bridge in just over a fortnight.

Bamber lie two points behind FC in the league with a game in hand and have the best defensive record in the division but that statistic was made to look sickly as Marginson&apos;s side ripped into them from the off.

Chief tormentor was Wright, who made his intentions known in the second minute when he scored with an emphatic drive.

Options

Eight minutes later, Wright was at it again as he fed off raking passes from Chris Baguley, himself in imperious form, alongside brother Jamie, making his first start for the club.

This time Wright left Telford for dead and weighed up the options before squaring it for Chris Baguley to stroke in the second.

The younger of the two Baguley brothers curled in a trademark free-kick on 20 minutes to virtually wrap the tie up.

It was four by half-time as Jamie Baguley got in on the act, slipping a smart pass through for another midfielder, Nicky Platt, to steal through and smash his shot past hapless keeper Graham Bennett.

Strikers Peter Thomson and Aaron Burns played a full part in the first-half rout without scoring, but former United reserve Burns made it four goals in four appearances with a thumping far post header from a corner.

Stuart Brennan


FC UNITED have top spot in their sights after racking up a sixth successive win and pulling off their first league double of the season.

The Rebels can edge ahead of leaders Curzon Ashton on goal difference if they win at Clitheroe next week, as the Tameside outfit are involved in the FA Cup.

And FC manager Karl Marginson says there is a healthy rivalry growing with Curzon, who were promoted with his team last season and lost a tense League Challenge Cup final as the Rebels did the double.

&quot;We haven&apos;t played them yet, but they have done really well so far and are still unbeaten in the league. But I saw them at Bamber Bridge recently when they were lucky to get a result,&quot;he said.

&quot;We have already had a form blip, and it will be interesting to see how they cope when their comes. They also have three of our old players in Rhodri Giggs, Alex Mortimer and Joz Mitten, so that all adds a bit of spice to the rivalry.&quot;Against Bridlington, who were hammered 6-0 at Gigg Lane in August, Aaron Burns made it five goals in five games since he joined FC on a temporary basis to set them on their way to another victory, and Jerome Wright added a second shortly after the interval.

That set the stage for the Rebels&apos; own showman Rory Patterson, who confirmed himself as top scorer in the UniBond League first division north with his 16th of the season, a classy lob over the keeper with the outside of his foot.

&quot;That was typical Rory,&quot;said Marginson.&quot;He had his back to goal, and just sneaked a little look over his shoulder, saw the keeper off his line and came up with a great finish. He comes up with unexpected goals like that all the time.&quot;

Now FC are sweating on the results of the scan on last season&apos;s top scorer Stuart Rudd, who damaged knee ligaments a fortnight ago and may be out for the season.

The scan had to be delayed until the swelling on the knee reduced, and there has been a further delay in waiting for the specialist&apos;s report, but Rudd is expecting a result later today.

FC United v Clitheroe
UniBond League Division One North

FC UNITED could hit top spot for the first time this season when they take on struggling Clitheroe.

The breakaway club, chasing a third successive title, suffered a stuttering start to the new campaign.

But the Rebels are now back to their best after moving up to second after a sixth straight victory.

And the Gigg Lane tenants could move ahead of leaders Curzon Ashton on goal difference if they win at Clitheroe on Saturday, with the Tameside table-toppers in FA Cup action.

&quot;It would be a great psychological boost if we can achieve it,&quot;said FC boss Karl Marginson, whose team thrashed Bamber Bridge 5-0 in the President&apos;s Cup last Wednesday to complete a fine four days.&quot;The lads have responded well to the little blip and in the last two games they have been excellent.&quot;

United cut the gap at the top of the table to three points with a 3-0 victory at Bridlington Town.

Former Manchester United striker Aaron Burns led the way with his fifth goal in five games since joining the club, before a fine solo effort from Jerome Wright and captain Rory Patterson&apos;s 16th of the season completed the rout.

And Marginson hailed his in-form strike duo of Burns and Patterson as one of the reasons behind the Reds resurgence. He added:&quot;Aaron came at the right time for us and gave everybody a lift at the club, while I can&apos;t remember the last time Rory didn&apos;t score.

&quot;The two have formed a really good partnership. Apart from the goals, their movement is superb and they are an absolute nightmare for defenders.&quot;

Marginson, though, is waiting anxiously on the fate of last season&apos;s top-scorer, Stuart Rudd, who will discover whether he will play again this term.

The striker suffered a knee injury last month, but the severity of the problem will not be known until he receives the results of his scan tomorrow. If, as the club fear, it is a cruciate problem, then Rudd could be sidelined for up to a year.

By Staff Copy

DESPITE losing 3-0 to FC United of Manchester, Bridlington Town had a day to remember as a crowd of over 1,000 was recorded at Queensgate.

The revenue that went Towns way will help keep them going for some time, while the town as a whole benefited from the hundred of fans that travelled across the Pennines, with many vowing to comeback for another stay.

And while the football clubs coffers were boosted, many businesses in the town will have noticed a big difference in what is usually a quite time of year.

Many hotels and guest houses were booked up with fans making the most of the game on the east Coast making it a weekend break, while shops, restaurants and many others will also have had a peak in trade.

Bridlington Town chairman Peter Smurthwaite said: I trust many local hotels, boarding houses, restaurants, cafes, shops and taxis benefited from the visiting fans over the weekend which shows the value of this football club to the town.

It would be nice if some of these businesses could help the football club with much needed sponsorship to raise their own profile, especially with highlights from the game also being shown on the UniBond League TV channel, which can still be accessed on www.unibondleague.com this week.

The chairman was also pleased with how the club coped with such a spectator boom, with the gate up around 600% on usual weeks. I would like to thank my committee and staff who did a marvellous job to make sure the day was a success, I also thank our own fans, East Riding of Yorkshire Council, Insp Steve Jackson at Bridlington Police and the Free Press for their help and support.

Any businesses that may be interested in sponsoring a game, taking an advertising board, an advert in the match day programme or on the club website, can contact myself, the Free Press or the club website www.bridtownafc.co.uk for further information.

Here are just some of the views the Free Press received from visiting fans, with many leaving comments on our website http://www.bridlingtonfreepress.co.uk/

Thanks to everyone at Bridlington for their hospitality. Also a big thanks to the Beaconsfield Arms who made us very welcome.

A great weekend all round. Many thanks to Lyndsey, Simon and the staff at the Beaconsfield Arms, Patsy, Adie and staff at Ye Old Star Inn, Sue and the Staff at The Expanse and to all at Bridlington Town FC for their tremendous efforts.

Thanks Bridlington. We had a superb weekend both before the match at the Greyhound pub, during the match and after match party at Ye Olde Star Inn. Also big thanks to Trevor and Christine at the Ivanhoe Guest House who were friendly and welcoming hosts. We even had breakfast with the Brid Town manager and some of the players. We hope to be back and wish you all the best for the rest of the season. Anyone fancy a weekend way then Brid is the place to go.

We had a fabulous time this weekend. Comfortable stay at Radcliffe House. Good atmosphere at the game and in the social before, and yes the staff worked very hard. Cheap beer in the Old Town before the FC party.

Even managed a walk round the lighthouse at Flamborough to blow away the cobwebs. We shall definitely return.

FC United have received an invitation to participate in the eighth Annual International Hong Kong Soccer Sevens tournament, to be held in May 2008.

The worlds oldest football club and fellow UniBond League members Sheffield FC played in last years tournament alongside teams such as PSV Eindhoven, Spurs, Celtic and Aston Villa.

The FC United board are currently considering the invitation and working through the details and implications of the trip. It is anticipated that should we accept the invitation; the cost of the trip will have no financial burden on the club itself.

The invitation offers our players a tremendous opportunity to play in such a prestigious tournament and end of season trips such as this and our earlier trip to Leipzig helps with player recruitment and retention. FC does not pay the biggest wages but along with our large and passionate support we do offer players opportunities that would not be readily available elsewhere.

It goes without saying, nonetheless the board is keen to stress that the motive for going would not be to sell shirts or promote the brand but to give our players a unique opportunity to play in, and supporters the chance to watch their team in a prestigious tournament.

The board are aware that the trip will be beyond the reach of many supporters and the club are currently working on other offers that would involve a European trip next summer.

We would repeat that no final decision has yet been made and that supporters should await an official announcement before making any arrangements. TheGrand November 10th, 2007, 11:31 AM Let your hair down and give us a smile!

9/11/2007

RORY Patterson has been given some odd advice by his FC United boss Karl Marginson:&quot;Grow your hair and smile a bit more!&quot;

The Rebels&apos; leading scorer - with 16 in 15 games this season - is also top of their bookings chart, with eight yellows, just two short of a two-match ban.

Patterson has already missed four games through suspension this season, three for a red card in a pre-season friendly and one for totting up five bookings.

And Marginson believes that body language may be the key for the 23-year-old Ulsterman, who is leading the chase to be the first player to rack up 100 games for the club - he is currently on 95, three ahead of defender Rob Nugent.

&quot;I have had a chat about the way referees will perceive him,&quot;said Marginson, whose side will go top of the UniBond League first division north if they win at Clitheroe tomorrow.

&quot;Body language is something he can address. He can still have aggression and a will to win without being so demonstrative towards the officials.

&quot;A lad I used to play with in the youth ranks at Manchester United called Gary Vaughan used to wear his hair really long, and whenever he had it shaved off, he would pick up more bookings, so appearance plays a big part in it.

&quot;Also when you see Rory running up to refs, shoulders back, arms pumping, it influences whether they reach for a card or not. A little smile, a word and a handshake for the opponent, can go a long way.&quot;

Vice-captain Patterson, who is 23, has been donning the captain&apos;s armband in the absence of the injured Dave Chadwick, another ploy by Marginson to calm him down.

FC UNITED boss Karl Marginson is considering making changes for Wednesday&apos;s home clash with in-form Rossendale following a shock 2-1 defeat at Clitheroe which he described as&quot;a wake-up call.&quot;

Chris Baguley&apos;s superbly-executed free-kick failed to save the off-key Rebels as they fell to lowly opponents who had previously won just two from nine in UniBond division one north.

FC had a stroke of bad luck when keeper Sam Ashton was harshly adjudged to have conceded a penalty and, though he then saved it, Joel Byron followed up to score.

Paul Fildes seized on a defensive mix-up to double Clitheroe&apos;s lead on the hour and, although FC pushed hard for an equaliser after Baguley had reduced the arrears, their efforts came to nothing.

Marginson said:&quot;Defensively, we were poor and I&apos;ll be looking at a few things before naming my team to face Rossendale.

&quot;We struggled to adapt to the difficult conditions, but I&apos;m sure our younger players in particular will learn from this defeat and, hopefully, we can bounce straight back on Wednesday night.&quot; TheGrand November 15th, 2007, 11:26 AM Burns hat-trick keeps Rebels on the up

AARON Burns struck a 12-minute hat-trick as FC United blew Rossendale United away after the break to move up to second in the Unibond League Division One North table.

The former Manchester United reserve striker hit a stunning treble as FC scored five times in 23 second-half minutes to cut the gap behind leaders Curzon Ashton to three points at Gigg Lane.

Karl Marginson&apos;s team suffered a disastrous start when defender Rob Nugent was caught in possession and Ben Lloyd squared for Phil Eastwood to tap home in the second minute.

After squandering several chances, the Rebels equalised six minutes after the restart when the division&apos;s top scorer, Rory Patterson, hit his 17th goal of the season. Then Burns took over with two goals inside a minute.

His first, on the hour, put FC in front and he effectively wrapped up the points with a magnificent solo effort less than 60 seconds later.

The United hit man completed his hat-trick with a fine header on 72 minutes - his eighth goal in seven games - and Chris Baguley added a fifth two minutes later to seal the breakaway club&apos;s seventh win in eight games.

Tony Howard
15/11/2007

FC UNITED are setting up a scouting team to trawl the north west for talent with a defender first on the wanted list.

The reds boss Karl Marginson has been disappointed with his teams defensive frailties in recent weeks, culminating in FCs six-match winning streak coming to an end at Clitheroe on Saturday. And he admits it may be time to strengthen that department.

Despite brilliant performances from his strikers Aaron Burns and Rory Patterson plus winger Jerome Wright, which saw United cruise to some impressive victories over the likes of this Saturdays opponents Bamber Bridge, Margy is less impressed with his back line.

FC are in the play-off places in the UniBond North with Bamber Bridge waiting to strike below them. They have games in hand and are smarting from a 5-0 defeat to FC in the Presidents Cup two weeks ago.

Margy said: I think the front three or four have got us out of trouble recently and if they have an off day, like at Clitheroe last weekend, we need the defence to step up and be counted.

I think we have been a bit lax at the back in recent games and we may be need to address that in terms of personnel. We have missed captain Dave Chadwick through injury and I may think about playing new boy Colin Bell in the middle of defence to see if that helps.

We have struggled with injuries and when weve gone to people, who we thought were our friends in the game, weve been let down and no one has wanted to help us by loaning players.

We need to do something about that so first team coach Darren Lyons is going to oversee a scouting network with help from my assistant Phil Power. Daz hopes to get his own team in place to watch sides at our level and younger players with a view to bringing them to the club.

Tony Cullen, who was the reserve team manager, has been brought into the first team set-up as a coach and he has already made an impact with his excellent coaching methods and his ability to raise the team spirit and get the banter flying in the dressing room.

United were beaten 2-1 at Clitheroe on Saturday in a stormy encounter. The home side went 1-0 up in the first half and added a second from a disputed penalty in the second.

Chris Baguley scored another great free kick to give the reds hope but they ran out of time.

Following a 5-1 defeat of Rossendale United on Wednesday night, Bamber Bridge now lie in wait for United and they will have revenge on their minds.

Margy added: They will be fired up and ready to prove that the last result wasnt a true reflection on them.

Apparently, they rested a few players last time so those that missed that game will be chomping at the bit to get at us.

We have to rise to it because Bamber Bridge are one of our promotion rivals and this game could have an impact later in the season.

The match on Saturday, November 17, kicks off at 3pm at Brigs Irongate ground and ticket information is available by calling: 0870 626 0295.

Labels: Prestwich Advertiser TheGrand November 16th, 2007, 02:14 PM Fans divided over FC United

15/11/2007

AN AWFUL lot of people seem to be getting their knickers in a twist about non-league football these days.

Some fans in Manchester, who once saved their wrath for the likes of lucky&apos; Liverpool, dirty Leeds and boring, boring Arsenal, now prefer to target their angst at a side in third place in the Unibond First Division North.

Were talking, of course, about the breakaway side FC United.

Time, it seems, has done little to heal the wounds caused by the painful split when some United fans decided to form their own club in the wake of Malcolm Glazers take-over at Old Trafford in 2005.

There is a vocal minority among United fans who come to see the self-styled Rebels as the enemy with some even going so far as to print stickers bearing the slogan: Love United, Hate FC: Judas Scum. Even Sir Alex Ferguson has had a pop, labelling FC fans as self-publicists.

The views of many FC detractors were neatly summed up in the letters page of last weeks Reporter by Terry Medford of Withington.

Mr Medford accuses FC of being a club born out of spite and bitterness and accused its fans of revelling in knocking up cricket scores against teams with comparatively tiny resources.

As a season-ticket holder at Old Trafford, I had my own reservations about FC. A breakaway club was always going to divide fans whose strength had always come from beingwell, united.

But curiosity soon got the better of me and I went along to my first FC game.

It was really quite something to be stood there that day shoulder-to-shoulder with thousands of people all sharing a deep passion for something that hadnt existed just a few weeks earlier - something they had worked together to build from nothing.

And nor had they forgotten what brought them together in the first place - their love for Manchester United.

Among the newly-created FC anthems ringing around the stands that day were old Stretford End favourites celebrating a love for United that was and remains undiminished.

Since that day, Ive tried to go to FC as often as I can while at the same time still holding on to my season ticket for Big United.

There are two main charges critics often level at FC fans: they are splitters who turned their backs on their team during a time of adversity and that they are the Chelsea of non-league football with resources and attendances dwarfing those of their rivals.

Well, yes, FC do have larger crowds (around 2,500 for a home game) and consequently more money and greater player-pull, but why should they apologise for that? Their record - after last weekend - of eight wins, one draw and four defeats, hardly suggests an all-mighty force crushing all before it.

The labelling of FC fans as glory hunters seems to me the most ludicrous charge of the lot.

It is a strange kind of glory when you find yourself sat in the stands on a freezing pea soup winters evening, as I did last year, watching FC battle their way to victory over Atherton Collieries in a bog in Leigh - especially for fans more familiar with watching European giants such as Juventus, Barcelona and Bayern Munich on their visits to the Theatre of Dreams.

From day one, FC has been a broad church. Some fans see it as a way of protesting against Glazer rule, others as a way of enjoying football the way they used to before the terraces were replaced by sanitised all-seater stadiums.

But what all FC fans have found is a way of remaining as United fans in an age of soaring ticket prices and the relentless commercialisation.

Moving to another club was never an option. Supporting a team involves more than just watching football. It involves buying into an identity, a history, a brotherhood and a way of seeing the world.

Following a Premier League team is an expensive business these days, especially if you have children. But when the day comes that I am finally priced out of Old Trafford or forced to look elsewhere for regular football, I know Ill have somewhere to go, somewhere where I belong.

Not all fans curdle with resentment at the thought of FC. The club has forged close links with the breakaway AFC Wimbledon, formed when their mother club moved from south-west London to Milton Keynes, and even groups such as Red Action opposing an attempted buy-out at Arsenal.

It took a Leeds fan to bring home to me what had been achieved at FC. After spotting my FC United away shirt during a recent five-a-side game, he told me that he had been hoping his club would do something similar following a summer of boardroom turmoil, but concluded: We havent got the nous.

In his letter, Mr Medford rightly warns that the future of football will depend on true supporters. But if he thinks fans are doing the game any favours by blindly shelling out for astronomically priced tickets or merchandise, he is wrong.

The creation of FC has sent out a message that there is another way. One that doesnt mean giving up who you are.

And in the process they have struck a blow for football fans everywhere. Its just that not everyone can see it yet.

Burns fires a warning
Stuart Brennan in the MEN
16/11/2007

ROBBIE Fowler and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink beware - Aaron Burns is after your jobs!

The FC United striker struck a classy hat-trick against Rossendale in midweek, and is aiming for more in the clash with promotion rivals Bamber Bridge.

Watched by Premier League clubs, Blackburn and Everton on Wednesday, as well as Chesterfield and Huddersfield, Burns showed why he was Manchester United Reserves&apos; top goalscorer last season, and why Cardiff moved for him in the summer.

A registration foul-up means Burns can only play at UniBond League level or below until the transfer window re-opens in January, and he is making the most of his time at FC with eight goals in his seven games.

And that form could see a change of heart from Cardiff boss Dave Jones, who allowed Burns to drift away from the club - which still hold his registration - after signing Fowler and Hasselbaink.

FC boss Karl Marginson said:&quot;What Aaron did on Wednesday was the sign of a good forward, because he kept going, even after a bad miss in the first half. Cardiff haven&apos;t been scoring too many, so Fowler and Hasselbaink watch out.&quot;

FC are again tucked in behind leaders Curzon Ashton, but Bamber Bridge are a tough proposition at home.

By John Hill

Bamber Bridge cruised to a 3-0 victory over league favourites FC United in a record league crowd of 1435 at Irongate.

After losing to the Manchester United breakaway club 5-0 last month, you would have expected Phil Entwistle&apos;s men to be in for a tough afternoon but it was far from the case.

Brig were on top all afternoon in all areas of the pitch, out battling United, to send out a clear message to the rest of the division.

It took 11 minutes for the opening goal of the game. Stephen Brown&apos;s cross from the right should have been easily caught by Sam Ashton in the FCUM goal but he dropped the ball right into the path of Brig&apos;s leading tallies man Ryan Salmon, who was never going to miss from close range.

Bamber Bridge almost doubled their lead just minutes later. Brown&apos;s cross found Alex Porter unmarked in the box, his shot was terrifically saved by Ashton in the United goal, to make up for his previous howler.

FC United did respond in the last ten minutes of the opening half and showed a bit of class that you would expect from the side flying high in the division. However, the Brig weathered the storm to hold on to their lead going into the interval.

If the message at half time from manager Phil Entwistle was to kill the game off then they certainly did that in the opening ten minutes of the second half.

Brig came out after the break like a house on fire. They were rewarded with their second of the game after 51 minutes, David Eaton opening his Bamber Bridge account, drilling home from 12-yards.

Then just three minutes later, it was effectively game, set and match. Brown who was terrific all afternoon whipped a free kick in to the box and there was Salmon to flick home comfortably for his second of the game.

In all fairness Bamber Bridge could have had more but with an impressive display and result to go with it, this can now be a catalyst for their season ahead.

FC Uniteds recent inconsistency has seen them fall six points off the pace of leaders Curzon Ashton. The situation is something manager Karl Marginson wants to address immediately and he has ordered his players to stand up and be counted against title rivals Bradford Park Avenue this Saturday.

After five defeats in the league already this season, two on the last two Saturdays, Margy knows that the Reds cannot afford to drop many more points if they want to keep alive their aspirations of sealing three back-to-back titles by being crowned champions of the UniBond Division One North come next April.

Despite the defeats, only one has come at home in the league and that was during a controversial encounter with Garforth Town back in August. Gigg Lane remains something of a fortress for FC United, particularly on a Saturday afternoon.

Margy is aware of this fact. He said: Its a huge game against one of the best teams in the league on Saturday. Weve got to bounce back from last weekends defeat at Bamber Bridge and the lads need to stand up and be counted.

Itll be good to get back to Gigg Lane at three oclock on a Saturday, its been nearly a month since we beat Ossett Albion there and we never underestimate how much playing in front of our home supporters can spur us on. With our fans behind us, we can beat anyone in this league.

Park Avenue will be keen to spoil the party and silence the home fans though. After dishing out a 4-1 thrashing in the FA Trophy at Radcliffe Borough last month they will be confident of teaching United another footballing lesson.

Due to the FA Trophy defeat Park Avenue will have a psychological advantage over the Reds, however manager Benny Phillips is aware that United could easily have won the original fixture which finished 1-1. He said: FC were better than us on the Saturday and we got away with it. The poor performance gave us a kick up the backside and we put in a much better display for the replay.

Benny was brought in during the summer and its been no secret that he has had a decent budget to revamp the clubs squad. Hes confident of that his players have got what it takes to secure promotion but he believes that FC United definitely pose a threat.

He added: The league match against FC United will be a tough match. They have some exciting players and the crowd spurs them on hopefully the atmosphere will also lift our players. I can see us, FC United and Newcastle being up there at the end of the season.

FC United of Manchester versus Bradford Park Avenue is this Saturday at Gigg Lane with kick off at 3pm. Get yourself to that football ground. TheGrand November 23rd, 2007, 02:21 PM Avenue face tough Gigg Lane test

By Ian Whiting

Avenue&apos;s run of consecutive UniBond Division One North victories will be under severe threat on Saturday when they take on FC United of Manchester.

The promotion contenders briefly swapped second place in the table last week, with Avenue currently occupying the runners-up spot but only on goal difference as the pair trail leaders Curzon Ashton by just three points.

Avenue are hoping most of their core supporters will follow them over the Pennines to Gigg Lane, home of Bradford City&apos;s league rivals Bury. FC United have been tenants at the Coca-Cola League Two ground since being formed by disgruntled Manchester United supporters.

They have a huge following for a non-league club and Avenue&apos;s three or four hundred loyal fans face being outnumbered by as much as ten to one - but club captain Steve Connors feels the venue will bring the best out of the players in the Bradford squad.

&quot;The lads will be up for it in the first place because it is against one of the teams in and around us in the table,&quot;said Connors, who began his career at Bury&apos;s neighbours Oldham Athletic.

&quot;But I know they are all looking forward to playing in a stadium like Gigg Lane and the playing surface is very good.

&quot;This will be one of the biggest tests of the season but we have won five on the trot, one of those against the league leaders, so we are confident.

&quot;I know we have the quality in the squad to go and get a result against FC United but at the same time we all know how tough this game will be.&quot;

The teams have already met twice this season but not for league points. Avenue had home advantage in the FA Trophy preliminary round and although the clash at Horsfall Stadium ended all square, Avenue won the replay 4-1 and Connors was one of the scorers.

Paul Gedman started the rout that night at the beginning of October but Avenue boss Benny Phillips has confirmed his joint top scorer is facing a protracted lay-off following the injury he suffered in the 3-0 home win over Bridlington Town last Saturday.

Phillips said:&quot;Paul&apos;s leg is still very swollen. I went to BRI to see him after the game and was pleased to find out that it wasn&apos;t a broken bone.

&quot;We haven&apos;t seen much of him this week due to the fact that he can&apos;t drive because of the swelling and until that goes down the medical staff won&apos;t be able to tell how much ligament damage there is.

&quot;If Paul is going to be out for a long time I will look to bring in another striker, either on loan or a short-term deal. He had seven stitches in an open wound so we are looking at a minimum two to three weeks before he gets back into full training.&quot; TheGrand November 24th, 2007, 07:55 PM http://img2.putfile.com/thumb/11/32713494053.jpg (http://www.putfile.com/pic.php?img=7156712)

:cheers: TheGrand November 27th, 2007, 12:13 PM Fans play part as Avenue dig deep

By Ian Whiting

FC United 3, Bradford Park Avenue 4

Avenue put daylight between themselves and one of their major rivals for promotion from UniBond Division One North with a superb victory in an incident-filled match at Gigg Lane.

The Coca-Cola League Two ground of Bury FC, which will be visited by the other Bradford side on the first Saturday of the new year, was a fitting venue for such a close-fought contest.

&quot;It was a high-scoring game and I would have thought it was a very entertaining one for the big crowd,&quot;said Avenue boss Benny Phillips of the clash in front of 2,283 spectators, which equalled FC United&apos;s record this season.

&quot;There was fantastic support from our fans, who really made themselves heard and contributed to a great atmosphere in the stadium. It was very enjoyable from my point of view.

&quot;I was disappointed with their third goal because there was a foul on Tom Baker before they broke to get the penalty. It was a foul in the area, I&apos;m not disputing that, but play should already have been stopped.

&quot;We conceded two goals from set-pieces, which is unlike us, but take nothing away from FC United as they are a top-quality side.&quot;

Phillips, a former professional with Bury at Gigg Lane, added:&quot;Ben Jones is going through an unfortunate little spell. He had a goal disallowed here and two in the last home game. He is certainly putting the effort in.

&quot;Mike Moseley was fantastic in this game and Steve Connors was awesome but I wouldn&apos;t like to single anyone out because it was a real team performance.&quot;

Avenue got off to a wonderful start by taking a first-minute lead. Liam Flynn powered through to prevent a wayward pass going out of play and his cross was converted by a Moseley header.

The home side responded in some style and by the 16th minute they were 2-1 in front.

Their first came from a corner, central defender Adam Turner heading in, and Avenue keeper Jon Worsnop then made a fine save only to see Chris Baguley sweep the ball home.

Avenue were back level by the break after skipper Connors curled a low shot from distance into the bottom corner in the 38th minute - and the visitors got their noses back in front just after the hour mark.

Moseley was pushed over in the area by Turner and the referee immediately pointed to the spot, Darren Hockenhull stepping forward and making no mistake.

Just six minutes later Jones collected a Worsnop kick out and crossed for Moseley to add the fourth Avenue goal.

FC United hit back again just into stoppage time when former Avenue player Rory Patterson netted from their own penalty.

A ball into a packed area caused confusion and Avenue defender Matt Daly was singled out as the man who made the foul challenge.

That was just into the second minute of the four that were added and the home side, backed by their huge following from the terraces, ensured the visitors endured a tense ending.

Stuart Brennan
26/11/2007

KARL Marginson will be happy to stick by his makeshift back four as his team head to Mossley for a derby match on Tuesday night.

The Rebels&apos; defence, including debutant Danny Jarrett and 21-year-old Adam Turner who made his first start, shipped four goals against a team which is emerging as favourite to clinch the one automatic promotion spot in the UniBond League&apos;s first division north.

It was the second time in six weeks that the Yorkshire outfit - reputed to be the division&apos;s biggest spenders - had scored four on FC turf, after their surprising 4-1 FA Trophy rout last month.

But Marginson had nothing but praise for his injury-hit team, which was without four of their six contracted players including goalkeeper Sam Ashton and defensive rock Dave Chadwick.

&quot;I was proud of the way we kept going, and thought a draw would have been a fair result,&quot;said the manager philosophically.

&quot;Given all the injury problems we had, I thought we played some excellent football, but I&apos;m afraid you don&apos;t always get out of a game what you put into it.

&quot;The defence did well considering it was thrown together at training on Thursday night, and only had 45 minutes to work together before coming up against a team as dangerous as Avenue.

Problem

&quot;We brought Adam in from the reserves, where he was player-of-the-season last term, and I thought he was possibly man-of-the-match, especially as it was his first start in such a big match.

&quot;He grew in stature as the game went on. We will have to see how Rob Nugent is before picking the team for tomorrow night - he was suspended but has a cartilage problem and his ankle strapped, but this game proved to me that we have more than capable replacements with the two lads who came in.&quot;

Avenue hit FC with a sucker punch in the first minute, centre forward Mike Moseley heading in the first goal but the Rebels hit back as Turner headed the equaliser from a corner and Chris Baguley forced the ball home to make it 2-1 on 15 minutes.

But Avenue were level before half-time through Steven Connors and went ahead through Darren Hockenhull&apos;s spot-kick on 63 minutes when a dubious penalty was awarded against Turner.

Marginson was furious with the decision.

He said:&quot;The lad just ran across Adam and tripped over - no way was it a penalty.&quot;

Avenue made it 4-2 on the counter-attack through Moseley again, but FC replied with a Rory Patterson penalty in the dying seconds after battling Simon Carden had been brought down.

Just click below TheGrand December 2nd, 2007, 01:16 PM Community News - FC United and MANCAT Initiative

FC Uniteds links with MANCAT were put to use with a session organised for a group of young people from Newton-le-Willows and St. Helens who enjoyed a fun day of football training and life coaching with Karl Marginson on Friday 23rd November.

The session was arranged to take place at MANCAT who very kindly made the excellent football facilities, classrooms and IT suites at their Nicholls Street site available for the day.

The young people who came are pupils at Newton-le-Willows High School, St. Aelreds Catholic Technology College in Newton-le-Willows and St. Cuthberts Catholic College for Business and Enterprise in St. Helens. They were accompanied by learning mentors from school and staff from Haydock Pupil Referral Unit who had organised the trip.

The day started off with some football training which in turn led to a match with staff and pupils taking part. The morning was rounded off with a session where pupils discussed the importance of setting targets in life and listened to Karl give an insight into the challenges faced by professional footballers and the way in which players and coaches use targets to achieve their objectives.

After lunch in the canteen, where the secondary school pupils were astonished to see that chips were available, the group went into the IT suite where they went onto MANCATs website to do some research into the different courses available that might be of interest to them. For all the pupils, it was the first time they had been to a college or even thought about what a college might look like. Several pupils were able to identify a course that they would like to do and found out what GCSE grades they would need to achieve to make that possible.

The day was rounded off with a free kick challenge, another match and DVD highlights from FCs 8-0 victory over Glossop North End from last season. Several pupils were impressed by the quality of football they saw on the DVD and they were even more impressed when they heard that it only cost two quid to get in.

Asked what he had learned from the day, one youngster replied, I need to track back and defend more and I need to get five GCSEs including Maths and English to get onto a BTEC course in IT!

One of the teachers involved in setting up the day, Robin Pye, himself an FC member, said, Its been a great day. I am very grateful for the generosity of MANCAT and the friendliness of their staff. Karl was brilliant with the youngsters. They will have got a lot out of it. I hope that pupils from other schools can benefit from these sessions with Karl. I think our club could play a big role in a lot of young peoples lives through these types of sessions.

We are looking to extend this type of activity to other groups of young people. If you work with young people who would enjoy this type of activity, or know a group that would benefit then please do not hesitate to contact Karl via the club office to see what we can arrange.

Kids go free this Saturday

After getting back to winning ways at the weekend with the 2-1 defeat of Rossendale, FC United will be hoping to put on a more convincing display against Chorley at Gigg Lane this Saturday where the crowd should be boosted by scores of young Reds for under-18s go free day.

Back in September, United put Chorley to the sword with a 3-0 victory and they will be hoping for more of the same in the reverse fixture. It was the Reds third trip to Victory Park in three years but the first time they actually got to play the owners; previously they had defeated Daisy Hill 3-0 in the inaugural season and Atherton LR 7-0 there last season.

After stopping the rot of three straight defeats, United will be looking to kick on to the busy festive period which sees no fewer than six games in just over three weeks including tricky away ties to Ossett Albion and league leaders Curzon Ashton.

First though, Margys men must deal with the visit of Chorley who are known as the Magpies due to their long-standing colours of black and white stripes. The Magpies were formed as a rugby club in 1874 before switching to football in 1883, which will means their 125-year anniversary will be celebrated in 2008.

Chorley are struggling at the foot of the table this season and manager Gerry Luczka, who was appointed in October 2006, says that the club are still in a period of transition.

Gerry took what had become a managerial hot seat and he seems to have sparked a turnaround with more quality players joining Chorley and attendances have increased as the fans turn out to back the managements efforts to rejuvenate the club.

However, its still a work in progress. Last season, Chorley finished in 23rd spot but avoided relegation and results have not been much better so far this season. Gerry said: When I joined the club, the footballing set-up was poor. Last season was simply about damage limitation. During the pre-season I brought in 18 new players which doesnt help continuity and I am still learning about some of them. However, I relish the challenge to turn this club around but people will have to be patient.

Gerry added: It was clear that FC United were buoyant that day, playing free-flowing football with lots of confidence. The match at Gigg Lane will be a great occasion, it is fantastic venue for UniBond football. We hope to give a good account of ourselves.

FC United of Manchester versus Chorley is this Saturday, 3pm at Gigg Lane. Its 7.50 adults, 5 concessions and under-18s gain entrance for absolutely nothing just turn up on the day. Get yourself to that football ground.

As a result of the inclement weather a pitch inspection took place at 1:00pm this afternnoon (Friday 7th January) and as a result tomorrows game against Chorley FC has been postponed due to a water logged pitch.

We would like to apologise to supporters for any inconvenience caused. TheGrand December 12th, 2007, 11:50 PM League change Curzon kick-off time for TV - CLUB STATEMENT

We have been informed that the League Management Committee has switched the kick off time of our fixture against Curzon Ashton from 3pm to a lunchtime kick off to accommodate the game being televised on the Leagues Internet TV channel.

FC United and Curzon Ashton had informed the League prior to the League Management Committee meeting that both clubs would be opposed to the switch but the League have chosen to ignore our views. We have written to the League and asked them to reconsider but they are standing by their decision.

When our club representatives discussed the new NPL TV deal with League officials over the summer we received assurances that no game would be moved for TV without the agreement of both participating clubs. The League also circulated all clubs in November with reassurances that Saturday games would not be televised live.

As a result of these assurances not being maintained and that the League Management Committee have gone against the expressed wishes of both clubs, the board of FC United and club officials will not be present at the fixture. In line with that position the board requests that supporters exercise their power to influence decisions, by also not attending. For those that do not and that seek an alternative it is hoped that an event at our reserve fixture against Eagle Sports at Abbey Hey on the same day at 2pm will be held.

An FC United board spokesman said:

TV exposure and the revenue it generates are important to football. There are times when moving a fixture is unavoidable and you only have to look at Harrogate Railways recent televised FA Cup game to see that in some cases it is even desirable. But to renege on previous assurances, seek the views of clubs about a change to the kick off time and then disregard the views of the competing clubs and its supporters in this manner is unacceptable.

The board of FC United is asking supporters to show their opposition to the Leagues decision by not going to the game against Curzon. It is regrettable that Curzon Ashton may suffer financially from the consequence of this change to the kick off time, especially given their support in opposing the switch. However the board feel that it is important that a message is sent to the League that the views of the match-going fan must take precedence and those fans should not be inconvenienced in favour of a potential Internet audience

All supporters are free to make up their own mind as to whether they support the call not to attend but the board of FC United believes that this particular issue is intrinsically linked to the disillusionment with top-flight football shared by many fans, that led to the formation of our club and as such a strong message needs to be communicated to the League. TheGrand December 15th, 2007, 04:10 PM Rebels kick off boycott

13/12/2007

FC United have urged their supporters to boycott the crunch promotion clash at Curzon Ashton on December 29 after a row with the UniBond League.

The league&apos;s management committee has insisted that the fixture between the teams currently top and fifth in the first division north, be switched to a 12.45pm kick-off.

The move is to enable the transmitting of the match by the league&apos;s own broadband television broadcaster NPLTV, which claims an average of 15,000 viewers globally a week.

Both clubs opposed the idea of the kick-off time being switched but the league says that the commercial advantages of the 100,000 paid for TV rights by Invision outweigh the concerns of the two clubs involved.

FC claim that the switch is against one of the founding principles of the club, which is that TV companies should not be allowed to dictate kick-off times.

The upshot is that a festive fixture which might reasonably have drawn a crowd of over 2,000 will probably now only get a three-figure attendance.

A statement put out by the club said:&quot;The board of FC United is asking supporters to show their opposition to the league&apos;s decision by not going to the game against Curzon.

Switch

&quot;It is regrettable that Curzon may suffer financially from the consequence of this change to the kick-off time, especially given their support in opposing the switch.

&quot;However, the board feels that it is important that a message is sent to the league that the views of the match-going fan must take precedence and those fans should not be inconvenienced in favour of a potential internet audience.

&quot;Curzon secretary Graham Shuttleworth said:&quot;We were asked our views on a 12.45 kick -off and our response was that we wished to stay at three o&apos;clock.

&quot;We are opposed to it but are also mindful that within the UniBond League there is NPLTV, and that the league&apos;s management committee has the right to vary times and dates of fixtures.

&quot;FC insist that they were given assurances that no fixtures would be switched for TV purposes without the agreement of both clubs, and that only midweek games would be shown live, with Saturday games being shown in a highlights package.

The league say this is the first Saturday game to be televised live this season.

Assistant league secretary Alan Allcock stated:&quot;The only assurance given was that we would never change the date of a fixture to accommodate televising of a game.&quot;

Wednesday 12th December

Fans of FC United of Manchester are ready to become the first set of football supporters in the country to boycott a game which has been shifted to suit television schedules.

FCUMs Unibond First Division North clash with local rivals Curzon Ashton was due to kick off at 3pm on Saturday, December 29, but will now kick off at 12.45pm to allow the game to be shown live on the Leagues own internet TV channel In-Vision.

Both clubs had informed Unibond League officials that they were strongly opposed to the switch, and had subsequently sent strong letters to that effect but were completely ignored.

And that despite the fact that during the summer club representatives received assurances no game would be moved for TV purposes without the agreement of both participating clubs. As recently as November, the League Management Committee had also told clubs Saturday games would not be televised live.

Consequently, both the board and club officials of FC United have decided not to attend the fixture and have requested that supporters exercise their power to influence such decisions, by also not attending.

FC United spokesman Jules Spencer told the FSF: This is not a case of us trying to act all big time, because we recognise TV exposure and the revenue it generates are a very important part of football - but to renege on previous assurances, seek the views of clubs about a change to the kick off time and then disregard the views of the competing clubs and their supporters in this manner is completely unacceptable.

So the board of FC United is asking supporters to show their opposition to the Leagues decision by not going to the game against Curzon Ashton. It is also regrettable they may suffer financially as consequence of this change to the kick off time, especially given that we had their support in opposing the switch.

However the board feel that it is important that a message is sent to the League that the views of the match-going fan must take precedence and those fans should not be inconvenienced in favour of a potential Internet audience

All supporters are free to make up their own mind as to whether they support the call not to attend but the board of FC United believes that this particular issue is intrinsically linked to the disillusionment with top-flight football shared by many fans, that led to the formation of our club and as such a strong message needs to be communicated to the League.

And the FSFs TV Contracts and Revenue Distribution spokesman Mark Longden fully supported the proposed boycott, saying:

Its like the thin end of the wedge, but in reverse, if you like because its certainly a first to see a football club representing the rights of its supporters by standing up against a TV company, and it sets a very positive precedent.

We all recognise that TV has a major part to play in the game of football, but the balance has swung way too far in the TV companies favour - and too far away from the match-going, admission paying, regularly attending football supporter.

That balance may take a long time to address, but I believe this is at least a step in the right direction and, as the ancient Chinese proverb says, even a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.

For those supporters choosing to back the boycott and seeking an alternative game, it is hoped that an event will be staged at FCUM&apos;s reserve fixture against Eagle Sports at Abbey Hey, on the same day at 2pm. TheGrand December 18th, 2007, 11:34 PM 30 minutes in

In respect of Invision Broadcast Medias request to the board of the UniBond League to feature the fixture between Curzon Ashton and FC United of Manchester with a 12:45 kick off on the 29th December 2007 and the subsequent statement issued by the board of FC United of Manchester, the board of Invision would like to make the following statement.

To feature this game was a decision taken in line with the full programme of games, some of which will be shown live early Saturday afternoons throughout late December and January

Prior to the start of the current football season, John Warrington of Invision met with FCUM chairman Andy Walsh and Mike Kirwin, whose attendance was to represent the interests of FCUMTV. This meeting was to discuss how NPLTV could affect the development of FCUMTV and how the club and its TV channel could work with Invision. At this meeting John Warrington was also informed that the club were worried that live screenings of FCUM home fixtures could cause a reduction in attendances of FCUM home games which in turn, would have an impact on its commercial arrangements with Bury FC in respect of its ground lease deal.

During this meeting and subsequent discussions Invision agreed with FC United the following.

1. That it would assist FCUMTV in helping to keep their programme on Channel M

2. That NPLTV would not cover any home FCUM games before Christmas.

The board of Invision would like to stress that it worked hard to help FCUMTV keep its show on Channel M and gave the channel permission to use at no cost, footage of FCUM matches as long as NPLTV could have access to the same footage.

The board of Invision has also kept its promise not to broadcast any home FCUM games before Christmas.

Further, Invision also granted permission to Mike Kirwin for FCUMTV to film FCUM away fixtures and broadcast them on FCUMTV, subject to certain conditions.

Therefore the board of Invision is dismayed at the attitude of the board of FCUM and that no proper discussions were held before the board of FCUM released its statement and called for a boycott of this fixture, particularly since Invision has shown nothing but a spirit of cooperation to FCUM and FCUMTV.

The board of Invision would like to categorically state that at no time were any promises made in respect of changing kick-off times on a Saturday. The only assurances made in respect of transmission times were

1. A fixture would not be moved from a Saturday to another day of the week for television purposes

2. No Saturday 15:00 games would be screened live.

This second assurance had to be given because of UEFA rule 48 which bans the transmission by any medium of a game kicking off at this time.

Therefore the key point put forward by the board of FCUM against moving kick-off times and broken promises is invalid simply because no promises were ever made. If either Andy Walsh or Mike Kirwin had requested such assurances, the board of Invision would like to state unequivocally that such assurances would not have been given.

Invision received a copy of two letters sent out by the Unibond league to all clubs in August and November. Neither letter contains anything that could be even closely interpreted as a promise that kick off times would not be moved to accommodate NPLTV.

For the record, Mr Warrington met with Alan Allcock and Mark Harris of the Unibond League in early November to choose the matches for broadcast in December. It was agreed that the time was right to introduce live Saturday matches into the NPLTV schedule.

Generally match selections are decided by broadband connectivity at grounds and how many times a club has appeared. It has been a policy when selecting matches that as many clubs as possible share in the revenue and that no one club becomes a regular on NPLTV.

For live Saturday broadcasts, it was also decided that only matches between two neighbouring teams would be selected. This was to negate the impact of different travelling times for supporters as much as humanly possible.

The preferred game that fitted all of the criteria on the 29th December was the game between Curzon Ashton and FCUM. At no time during this meeting was there any discussion about potential publicity because the game involved FCUM. The game was picked solely because it was the only one that fitted the criteria for the screening of a live game on a Saturday and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong and without foundation.

The board of Invision would far prefer not to have to request changes to kick-off times. But until UEFA rule 48 is changed there is no alternative. However Saturday games will only be selected for transmission if the criteria meet that as set out by the Unibond League.

For the record Mr Warrington was contacted by Andy Walsh when the league had notified FCUM that the kick off time was to be changed. At the time Mr Warrington was out of the country and requested that they have a discussion upon his return. Mr Warrington is disappointed that Andy Walsh did not wait for him to return to the country to have this discussion when the background to the decision to select this particular fixture could have been properly explained.

The board of Invision is disappointed that FC United have recommended to their supporters to boycott attending the fixture at Curzon Ashton. However while recognising and respecting the ethos of the club, it feels that the reasons for this boycott are groundless because the supporters of FCUM have not been made aware by its board of all of the facts surrounding not just this game, but the agreed timescale of the development of NPLTV which were set in motion long before FCUM gained promotion to Unibond League North.

Invision would like to publicly express its thanks to the UniBond League for its support in this matter. Invision works very closely with the Unibond League and its various committees which are all made up of individuals who have dedicated a huge amount of time for the development and the betterment of the UniBond League.

NPLTV has proved to be extremely successful since its launch as Unibond TV in January of last year and is now attracting 15,000 visitors per week from all around the world. This has enabled us to keep the service totally free since August and in closing the board of Invision would like to thank the many, many supporters who have taken the time to write to us and express their support of this initiative. TheGrand December 20th, 2007, 08:23 PM Board response to Invision statement

The board of FC United wishes to respond to the press release posted on the official league website on behalf of Invision and to comments made by John Warrington of Invision, on BBC London non-league show on Monday 17 December.

Invision firstly state that no assurances were given that fixtures would not be moved for television. Supporters will note that in our original statement this claim was not even made and instead refers to assurances of prior consent. It is disappointing that Invision have sought to deflect attention from the real issue at hand, by denying an allegation that was never made.

Secondly Invision state, no promises were ever made by anyone at Invision. Supporters will also note that we do not refer to Invision when talking of assurances but league officials.

The League rules give the Competition Secretary the right to amend scheduled fixtures and kick off times to meet television requirements as necessary.

FC Uniteds objection is that club representatives were told by a senior League official that no games would be moved for the purpose of television without the prior consent of both clubs.

Contrary to the comments made by John Warrington the Leagues Assistant Secretary has not denied that assurances were made he has instead claimed in the Manchester Evening News that a different assurance was given:

The only assurance given was that we would never change the date of a fixture to accommodate televising of a game.

This is not a true representation of the discussions held.

On 10 July 2007 representatives of FC met with league officials to discuss a number of matters including the Invision deal. At this meeting FC United asked the specific question would matches be moved for TV? In response The Leagues Assistant Secretary explicitly stated that games: would not be moved without the agreement of both the competing clubs.

In late November both Curzon Ashton and FC United were contacted separately by the League and asked if we would agree to the kick off time of our fixture on December 29th being changed to accommodate a live TV broadcast, both clubs said that they would not wish for the kick off time to be changed.

Not unreasonably given the assurances that FC United had been given by the League we believed that this would be the end of the matter. Subsequently we were surprised to be informed that the League were to impose a decision to change the kick of times.

John Warrington stated on BBC London that Curzon Ashton only objected to the change of kick off time after FC Uniteds board asked supporters to attend the reserve game, this is a lie and a deliberate attempt to mislead supporters.

FC United have no further desire to become embroiled in who said what to whom, as we are certain of our facts and confident of our position.
However we will not accept anyone accusing the board of misleading our supporters and if these false accusations continue they will be swiftly countered.

FC United believes that the club has been slandered by the Managing Director of a League sponsor who is claiming to do so with support of the League and as such FC United have lodged a complaint with the League Management Committee (LMC) against John Warrington for bringing the League into disrepute.

To compound the problem the LMC has seen fit to allow Invision to post an inaccurate press release explicitly attacking a member club, the press release has been published on the Leagues official website and circulated to member clubs. It is inappropriate that this has been done without asking for FC Uniteds comment or offering a right of reply and we have asked for the immediate removal of this statement.

FC United of Manchester believes that our club, its board and Curzon Ashton are due an apology for the false statements made by Invision and John Warrington and have requested that the League secures this apology on our behalf.

Finally FC United wish to make it clear that we support the League Management Committee in its efforts to secure additional sponsorship for the League and its member clubs. The greater exposure offered by TV is undeniably a good thing but moving kick off times to accommodate a TV broadcast has to be handled very carefully so as not to alienate the Leagues existing supporter base or place clubs in a financially disadvantageous position.

None of the League member clubs has seen the agreement between the League and Invision. None of the clubs were aware that the agreement between the League and Invision allowed for the change of kick off times to accommodate Invisions demands FC United have asked that the details of the agreement and any undertakings given on behalf of member clubs is circulated to clubs without delay. TheGrand December 21st, 2007, 10:54 PM From the Unibond League website, posted 21 Dec 07.

http://www.unibondleague.com/news.php?nid=6292

The Unibond League are disappointed that a member club, FC United of Manchester, have made the decision to publish on their Official Website a statement which brings in to question the integrity of the League and serving officers.

The Unibond League confirm that the fixture Curzon Ashton v FC United of Manchester will remain as published to kick off at 12:45 on the 29th December. At a meeting between Mr John Warrington of Invision and League Officers, Mr Warrington, mainly due to concern relating to threats he had received against his TV crew and their equipment, made the offer to stand down from broadcasting live the Curzon Ashton fixture, but the League did not agree to this suggestion. Curzon Ashton FC have been made aware of their responsibility to ensure the safety of all people attending the game. This includes FC United supporters who have expressed concerns that they do not support the boycott but are frightened for their personal safety from a minority who wish to take aggressive action against anyone who doesnt share their views.

FC United of Manchester Football Club have made reference to a meeting between itself and two of our league officers. This meeting was facilitated by Mr Andy Walsh at the request of the club to discuss the commercial operation of FCUM TV and how the Unibond Leagues agreement with Invision would impact on the ability of FCUM TV to transmit pre recorded or live transmissions via their own website.

The Terms of Reference for this meeting could not have included any dispensation to League Rule 8.13 which states The Competition Secretary reserves the right to amend scheduled fixtures and kick-off times to meet television requirements as necessary.

The league officers attending the meeting on July 10th categorically refute the accusation made by FC United of Manchester that a verbal agreement relating to kick off times was made. Had they done so, then these officers would have been acting outside their authority. However, by accepting promotion to the Unibond League, FC United of Manchester, like all Unibond League member clubs are obliged to accept unconditionally the articles and rules of the competition.

These rules are not subject to negotiation by any one member club. FC United of Manchester have not lodged any official document to the Unibond League stating they have a problem with rule 8.13. If they had done so it would have been dealt with through the due processes of the league and would have been recorded in the minutes of the meeting the correspondence was considered.

FC United of Manchester also make reference to a document distributed to all member clubs as a Frequently Asked Questions [FAQ] that was sent to clubs in November. This FAQ is a document that makes no reference to kick off times which are covered in rule 8.13.

FC United of Manchester have stated that the Unibond League ignored the wishes of both clubs after having initially consulted them over the change to the kick off time. As with all matches that are subject to being covered by NPL TV the home club is consulted as to the operational logistics to being visited by the TV crew. Curzon Ashton FC was consulted to ensure there would be no operational difficulties with regards to bringing the kick off time forward.

FC United of Manchester FC were told of the change to the kick off time as part of a telephone conversation covering other matters of league business. FC United of Manchester did state they were not happy with the proposal, and as is the position for all clubs they are entitled to have their case considered by the League Management Committee. This was done on the 5th December and is recorded in the minutes of that meeting. The decision was that the game should be played with a kick off of 12:45. Both clubs in accordance with league rules were informed of the change to the kick off time.

The Unibond League is disappointed that FC United of Manchester have advised their supporters not to attend the away fixture at Curzon Ashton as this action only harms one of their fellow member clubs. It does not put any pressure on the league to change rule 8.13 as this could only be done through a process involving all clubs nationally at Steps 1-4 [Conference National to NPL/SL/IL First Divisions].

It also does not give FC United of Manchester FC any leverage in making them an exception to rule 8.13.
The Unibond League have the right to conclude that, by taking promotion to the league, FC United of Manchester accept unconditionally the rules of the competition. However, if they believe that the ethos of their club has difficulty embracing those rules then the club must seriously consider at which level of football they wish to play.

Unibond League Chairman Peter Maude adds: The decision of FC United of Manchester to contest the kick off time of their game at Curzon Ashton on Saturday 29th December, a FIFA requirement to enable the game to be televised live, has led to a number of unwelcome issues and allegations which constitute a total negation of the sporting ethos of the Unibond League and its member clubs.

Different recollections of what was said and what was meant at an informal meeting in July between League representatives and FC United of Manchester officials seem to be at the centre of the problem, and without notes of the meeting, there can be no satisfactory conclusion.
However, the Unibond League Board of Directors have every confidence in their League Officers and individual members of the Board to carry out their duties for the express benefit of our member clubs without fear or favour and their integrity is without question !

Boycott Backing

27/12/2007

FC UNITED manager Karl Marginson has backed his fans’boycott of the team’s visit to Curzon Ashton this Saturday, December 22.

The club’s board requested the action after the Unibond League moved the kick-off time from 3pm to 12.30pm to accommodate their internet live TV coverage.

The move has angered members of the club, which was partly formed with a remit to counter the ills of modern football, including the changing of kick-off times to the detriment of supporters.

Marginson said:&quot;I fully support our fans in this action and I did even consider pulling the team out to show people that you cannot treat football supporters with such disregard as this. We decided that the punishments that would be imposed on the club meant it was advisable to play the match but that doesn’t alter the fact that I support the boycott.

&quot;It will be a good test for our players to play without the vocal backing and a wake up call to some of them who have got used to having 2,000 supporters singing their name.

&quot;Maybe some of our squad will realise again how lucky they are to have the support that they do and that has to be a good thing.&quot;

An event will take place the same day at FC’s reserve game against Eagle Sport at Abbey Hey’s Abbey Stadium, kick-off 2pm. For more details visit: www.fc-utd.co.uk.

Also what would happen if FC had a match moved in the FA Cup, would they withdraw, what happens if/when you get to conference level, would you refuse to take part? TheGrand December 27th, 2007, 02:48 PM I can understand why it&apos;s such a politically charged issue for FC Utd but deeply unfair on Curzon Ashton who will lose out on 10k or so, which at this level is an enormous amount of money. Also what would happen if FC had a match moved in the FA Cup, would they withdraw, what happens if/when you get to conference level, would you refuse to take part?

Each home club is entitled to take the switch, as has happened in previous years for more commercial reasons, now as happened then, you would expect that some fans would whinge and boycott the game, but you would never get our board putting in a suggestion to do so, as its the home clubs call.

The issue here is that both clubs said they didnt want to change the kick off time, and the league over ruled this (ignoring all the who said what stuff mentioned in all four official statements). So we are complying with their rules and fielding a team and fullfilling the fixture, there is no rule to say how many people should turn up.

And Im sure that a friendly with Curzon in the summer will help their coffers, as they have been working closely with FC over this issue I believe. This matter in no way is an attack on Curzon, and I for one would welcome a friendly with them.


With regards to a FA Cup switch, well if we&apos;re away, again this is the call of the home side, the response is difficult to predict if it was at Gigg Lane, as is the response to a home league game being switched for TV...... I think it would be protest gallore though, but I doubt a full on boycott would be on the cards due to the amount of money needed to break even at Bury, thats my view though, the membership and board may take a different view and alternative action taken TheGrand December 27th, 2007, 08:41 PM From the FC United of Manchester Official website, posted 27 Dec 07.

Curzon Update

The board would like to thank supporters for the incredible number of messages of support the club has received giving backing to the stand taken over the change to Saturdays kick off time.

Despite the depth of feeling expressed by supporters and, in the face of all reason Invision and the League have insisted the match goes ahead at lunchtime this Saturday, inconveniencing match-going fans and costing Curzon Ashton potential revenue.

In looking forward to the game Karl Marginson has given his backing to the stand taken by supporters:

I fully back the calls to boycott as I think the powers that be need to see that the supporters wont be messed around as they have been in the past for the benefit of television coverage.

If I was a fan I wouldnt be going, as I think its a wrong move on the Leagues part. Its strange that the first time they move a kick off time for TV its when were involved!

As a team, however, we have obligations to play the fixture because if we didnt the penalties imposed on the club would be very harsh.

Were therefore going to treat the game as a big test and wake up call for our players. Some of them have never played at this level without your backing, so it will build their character and improve them as people. It will also make some of them remember how lucky they are to have you lot backing them the way you do and I think that it will make for a very good exercise in putting things in perspective and appreciating what we have.

We really do appreciate your support, but also fully understand the decision to call a boycott.

Instead of looking for a solution Invision have instead now claimed that their staff face possible threats to their safety.

The League have asked FC United to put out a message to supporters that threats against Invision staff are unacceptable.

Invision have not supplied any evidence of potential threats or any indication that threats have come from anyone to do with FC United but as the League is obviously concerned FC United is happy to state that threats to the safety of anyone are unacceptable.

FC United is a democratic club and as such we respect those who do not share our view of the world. All supporters are free to make up their own mind as to whether they support the call to attend the reserves match at Abbey Hey.

The club is aware that there has been some talk of a protest at Curzons ground with banners and leafleting etc but we would respectfully suggest that the best possible protest and the best way to register any opposition to the decision to change the kick off time is to stay away from Curzon Ashtons ground on December 29th altogether and attend the reserve fixture at 2pm instead.

Saturday 29/12/07, kick off @ 2.00pm.

After the postponement of the last kids for free day, FC United are pleased to announce that we will be holding a Kids for Free Day on New Years Day. This is our home local derby against AFC Mossley, kick off 3pm at Gigg Lane.

Alan Hargrave of FC United said It was a great shame that the last Kids for Free Day on December 8th was called off due to the bad weather. I personally met several families who turned up on the day who were very disappointed, so its brilliant that we have been able to offer this to our young fans so soon after that event.

Prices are:
Under 18s Free
7.50 adults
5.00 over 60s and unwaged

So help introduce the next generation of FC fans to the game as we continue our commitment to fair priced football for all.

We all remember our first United game, being taken there by an elder. The nervous excitement of going through that turnstile and the realisation that this is where you wanted to be and be part of. The thrill of being on that terrace and singing your heart out for the lads even though you didnt know all the words yet.

For many young people these days that thrill has been replaced by the flick of a TV remote - FC want to change that.

If your child is already coming to games then get them to bring along their mates and let them see what it is you love about this club. TheGrand January 12th, 2008, 12:57 PM No show FC fans cost club 10,000

Boycott sparked by kick-off time switch

CURZON ASHTON 0 C UNITED 2

Tony Glennon

FC United fans voted with their feet to boycott their team&apos;s key promotion battle at Curzon Ashton - and left their top-of-the-table hosts counting the cost.

Just 297 paying spectators, at least 1,000 fewer than might otherwise have been expected, turned up at the Tameside Stadium to witness FC reignite their UniBond Division One North title challenge with this victory over the leaders.

That followed a request by FC chiefs for the supporters to stay away in protest at the League&apos;s decision to switch the kick-off to 12.45 p.m. so that it could be shown live on the Internet on NPLTV.

Curzon officials estimate the fans&apos; no-show cost them 10,000 in gate money, a vast sum for a club of their size.

And, while accepting FC&apos;s reasons for the boycott. Curzon chairman Ham Galloway. whose club also opposed the kick-off time being brought for*ward from 3 p.m.. said he was&quot;disappointed&quot;it had taken place and blamed the League for having failed to stop it.

Galloway said:&quot;It&apos;s written into FC United&apos;s constitution that they are not going to be pushed around by TV companies over kick-offs, but I would never support a boycott from our supporters on this issue. I think it could have been prevented by the League. There was no need for it to come to this.

&quot;Of course, we are disappointed by the gate because we were expecting at least another 1,000 on top.&quot;

FC United&apos;s general manager Andy Walsh defended the boycott, saying:&quot;We are aware of how important television is to football, but our objection is that assurances we believe we were given by the UniBond League that games would not be moved for TV without the agreement of the clubs have been reneged upon.

&quot;As a result, and also because the League ignored the express wishes of both clubs, we reluctantly asked our support*ers not to attend the game but instead watch our reserves play Club AZ at Abbey Hey.

&quot;As a members&apos;-owned club, it&apos;s not surprising that our fans heeded the call, with 467 at*tending the reserve team fix*ture and just a handful travelling to Curzon.

&quot;We have been accused of being narrow minded, but we are not burying our heads in the sand and recognise that some disruption to kick-off times is the inevitable price paidfor the money given to football by the TV companies.

&quot;But the wishes of the match-going fans must be paramount, otherwise what are we here for?&quot;

John Warrington, spokes*man for the UniBond League&apos;s TV partners Invision, insists his company made no pledges to FC United- He said.&quot;We are disappointed about this boycott because at no point were any promises made in respect of changing kick-offs on a Saturday.

&quot;Had such assurances been requested by FC United, they would not have been given. We feel the reasons for the boycott are groundless.&apos;

Goals by Simon Carden and Rob Nugent secured FC a victory which takes them back up to fifth place.

They trail Curzon by nine points and also have a game in hand on them.

By Nick Jackson

FC United leave for a mini-tournament in Germany on Friday buoyed by successive victories in the festive campaign which have put them within six points of league leaders Curzon Ashton.

They overcame hosts Curzon 2-0 on Saturday before romping to a typically buccaneering 5-2 win over Mossley at Gigg Lane on New Year&apos;s Day in which Rory Patterson came off the bench to score a hat-trick.

Jerome Wright gave the rebels a 13th minute lead, but that was cancelled out just before half-time by Gareth Hamlett&apos;s header.

Nicky Platt then missed a penalty before Patterson&apos;s introduction at the break sparked new life into the game.

His treble was added to by Platt, who atoned for his earlier error with a neat finish. Lee Connor grabbed a fine consolation for the visitors.

The form of FC has pleased manager Karl Marginson after a phase of erratic results which caused their credentials as table-topping candidates to be questioned.

He said:&quot;We got back to doing the right things against Curzon, which was a particularly pleasing result. We just have to keep that level of performance and consistency going.&quot;

With most of their rivals in cup action at the weekend, Marginson is taking his side to Germany for a seven-a-side tournament at the weekend.

They will next kick a ball in anger here when they host Flixton in the Manchester Cup on Wednesday.

Source: Edited from main article:

The police state quote is evidently an exaggeration only three fans have been ejected for standing at Uniteds past three home matches, with the club left to decide whether their season tickets are to be confiscated but United fans frequently express dismay at the match-day atmosphere, citing various factors.

These include poor acoustics in the Stretford End since it was rebuilt, the number of corporate seats and day-trippers, the pricing-out of many hard-core supporters, particularly since the Glazer familys takeover in 2005, and, uniquely to United, the formation of a breakaway club, FC United of Manchester, whose regular 2,000-plus attendances consist mostly of fans disenfranchised from Old Trafford.

Some of those fans raucous individuals who continue to follow United away from home boycott matches at Old Trafford because they do not want to line the Glazers pockets.

Ferguson has never hidden his contempt for those who jumped ship to set up a new club and he went farther in an interview on Tuesday when he criticised the unfair protests against the Glazers. Some of the fears expressed at the time of the takeover have not come to pass, but supporters are entitled to be upset by an aggressive ticketing policy that has priced many of them out of the ground.

Reds look to make it three in a row

Margy and the boys are looking to make it three wins on the trot this Saturday when the Reds entertain Chorley at Gigg Lane weather permitting, of course. Rob Pett provides this preview...

Having already beaten the Magpies on their own turf at Victory Park back in September, and with the recent victories at Curzon and against Mossley still fresh in the mind, you might forgive FC United boss, Karl Marginson, a degree of confidence going into Saturdays game. However, Margy remains adamant that there are no easy games.

He told the official website: The match against Chorley will be another tough game as they have signed players since our last game. These are the type of games you need to win.

We need to continue our run and notch up a few straight victories to stay nicely in the play-off places. I want us to prove were the best side in this league and that starts on Saturday against Chorley.

FC UNITED boss Karl Marginson conceded his off-key Rebels had been fortunate to beat 10-man Chorley to stay in the slipstream of UniBond First Division North leaders Curzon Ashton.

The lowly Magpies stunned Marginson&apos;s men when Stephen Burke gave them an eighth-minute lead, but the visitors then had Gavin Lee-Ellison sent off after he appeared to push Jerome Wright in the face.

Rory Patterson&apos;s 41st minute free-kick put FC back on terms, but they then had a series of lucky escapes and were relieved when substitute Simon Carden finally killed off Chorley with a 76th minute headed strike securing a win which takes them up to fourth.

&quot;We were certainly not at our best,&quot;admitted Marginson, whose FC side have now taken 13 points from the last 15 to restore hopes of a third successive promotion.

Victory keeps the Rebels six points behind leaders Curzon, who ended their mini-slump in style by thrashing Bridlington 6-0, with Mike Norton helping himself to a hat-trick.

Howards knee has responded well to the 20 minutes he was given as a substitute in the 2-1 victory over Chorley last week, his first appearance since United beat Trafford 5-2 in the FA Cup way back on September 2nd, and Margy believes Rudd and Chadwick are not far behind.

He said: Theyve all been back in training, Josh is doing well, touch wood Chaddy will be involved (in a game) in the next two weeks and, with a bit of luck, we might be able to give Stuart 20 minutes against Flixton.

Itll be great to have them back. Theyve done really well in rehab and theyve had to do a lot of it on their own, during their free time and their family time. I know from my own experiences how difficult that is and theyve done fantastic, so Ive got nothing but admiration for them.

Last seasons top scorer, Rudd has been absent with a cruciate problem since limping out of the 1-1 draw at Bradford Park Avenue on October 6th and Chadwick sustained cartilage damage exactly a week later in the 2-1 defeat of Wakefield at Gigg Lane.

The return of three of the most influential players in last seasons double winning team is likely to provide Margy with a selection headache but its one he is relishing. He said: Its the best way. I had it for the first two seasons and it was great. Ive been in a very privileged position and I cant wait to get back to it.

Although hes glad to finally have more options available to him, Margy was full of praise for the players who have provided cover in recent weeks: For the last few months Ive been looking for people to fill in and unfortunately Ive had to throw them in the deep end. A load of credit has to go to the lads who have come in and kept us in the promotion chase.

And the boss was clearly enjoying the prospect of having his squad bolstered by the experienced trio when he added: If these three get back to form theres no reason why we cant kick on and win the league. Who knows we might have a couple of cups to go with it too. A treble wouldnt be bad would it? TheGrand January 25th, 2008, 10:52 AM United into the semis in style

FC United cruised into the semi-finals of Manchester FA Premier Cup by dispatching Flixton 4-1 at Valley Road and the biggest cheer of the night was when substitute Stuart Rudd marked his comeback by grabbing the Reds fourth goal.

The evening started in sombre mood with an impeccably observed minutes silence for Flixtons reserve team player, 20-year-old Halton McCollin who tragically died in hospital on Tuesday after being shot in a Stretford takeaway on Saturday night.

In reflection, the importance of the match paled into insignificance to the loss of another young life to gun crime on the streets of Manchester but both teams were determined to mark the occasion with a good footballing contest.

Flixton, who although playing at home were officially the away team on the night due to a change in venues, were quicker out of the blocks and it was largely due to the agility of Sam Ashton on more than one occasion that United did not find themselves going down to an early goal.

The home side-cum-visitors did begin to press though and the first half was quite an end-to-end affair. It wasnt until the stroke of halt-time that the deadlock was finally broken though. Adam Carden was brought down in the box and captain Rory Patterson converted with aplomb for his 24th goal of the season.

United nearly doubled their lead within seconds when virtually straight from the restart Nick Robinson when racing clear, rounded the keeper but was somehow prevented from getting his shot off by a piece of solid defending by a covering defender.

Winger Josh Howard was back in the line up for the first time since September but it was Bradley Howard who made the biggest impact of the night. The left back brought the ball from inside his own half and looked to be trying to play Robinson through but when the Flixton defence backed off and backed off Howard just kept on going and unleashed a rasping drive in off a defender.

That goal seemed to settle the nerves and United began to play the better football. Substitute Chris Baguley put the result beyond any doubt in the 67th minute when he curled a free-kick low around the wall.

Flixton did grab a consolation goal with ten minutes to go through Greg Brickell but Rudd, who was wearing heavy strapping on his recovering knee, sent the FC United fans home happy by capping his 25 minute run out with the final goal of the night.

With barely two minutes to go Patterson reached the dead ball line and knocked the ball back to Rudd who slotted it home, immediately banishing the memory of nearly four months out on the sidelines and sending United into the semi-finals.

Stuart Rudd came off the bench to add to Rory Pattersons goal as FC United booked their place in the Quarter Finals of the Presidents Cup with a hard earned 2-1 win over Rossendale United at Gigg Lane.

As the game opened United had two good chances in the opening six minutes, the first a Patterson volley which just went wide and then his strike partner for the day, Simon Carden had a rather tame effort saved by Stags keeper Lee Bracey.

With two good chances early on the 1,554 in the Main Stand could have been forgiven for thinking it could have been a repeat of the 5-1 victory over the Stags back in December.

But what prevailed was more like the other two fixtures in the league, where United were made to work hard by a good defensive unit that didnt allow much to get past them.

Maybe it had something to do with the eerie emptiness of the Manchester Road End, but United werent firing on all cylinders in the first half. After a messy first half, the Reds took to the field fafter the interval knowing theyd have to improve to see off their opponents and they did just that.

Patterson signalled his intent by firing a vicious shot at goal, which was well saved by Bracey. And soon the opening came; a route one ball over the top found Patterson and the Irishman managed to lift the ball over the onrushing Bracey and into the Stags net to put United 1-0 up.

With less than 20 minutes remaining Margy moved to give Rudd another run out and he re-paid the manager with his second goal in four days.

Patterson broke on the right and squared the ball to Rudd, who simply slotted the ball home and put United into the quarter finals.

Rossendale did try to get back into the game and in the 84th minute got more than a consolation goal when left winger Matt Edgington rifled in off the cross bar from 25 yards out. A goal which received a well deserved applause from the FC United faithful.

The Reds saw out the remaining minutes and booked an away trip to our old friends Nantwich Town; who won their cup game today against Cammell Laird 5-1. The teams meet a week on Saturday for a place in the semi-finals.

The performance wasnt awe inspiring but the signs are looking good, United worked hard for a good victory other tough opponents and even though the Reds have won all four meetings between the sides, Margy will be thankful that he wont have to face a resilient Rossendale again this season.

Supporters of FC United have pledged over 30,000 per season to the clubs Development Fund.

Over 300 Reds have now set up standing orders direct to the fund following an appeal at the start of the season.

The Development Fund was set up in 2005 to help FC United achieve its aim of building its own stadium and facilities. In November last year a target of 30,000 a year via monthly standing order contributions was set by the clubs fundraising team. The target was broken ahead of schedule at Uniteds home game with Rossendale on Saturday 26th January.

It doesnt stop there. An FC Board member urged United fans to get involved with fundraising wherever possible the Development Fund is essential to the clubs ambition of owning our own ground, so please do your best to support the clubs fund raising activities and we will turn ambition into bricks and mortar. We still have a long way to go if were to do that. Overall were on target to get 60-80,000 in the bank this season but we still need the help of every supporter because we need to raise over 500,000.

The determination of FC fans to see the club in its own ground has seen many events take place; amongst them are after-match parties, raffles, auctions, race nights, over 50 supporters will be taking part in the Manchester 10k run in May to boost funds even further you name it, FC fans are doing it and all in the name of their own ground!

FC UNITED and potentially 900 travelling fans will flood Station View tomorrow, with chairman Rob Northfield predicting a miserable trip back to Manchester for the visiting hoards (3pm kick-off).

Despite their lowly position Northfield envisions a 2-1 win for Vinnie Brockies side and a passionate performance by Rail to avenge their 2-0 defeat at Gigg Lane earlier this season.

Northfield is in bullish mood as is manager Brockie after Rails 3-1 County Cup quarter-final victory over NCE Premier outfit Thackley on Wednesday night.

Carl Fox, Richard Marshall and Byron Littlefairs last minute strike set-up a mouth-watering semi-final against arch rivals Harrogate Town at Wetherby Road in March.

Neil Aspins men will enter the contest desperate to set the record straight after their 1-0 defeat in the FA Cup Battle of Harrogate last October.

First for Rail though is the anticipated visit of United with Northfield expecting a monster gate packed with passionate home and Mancunian support.

United have been in dominant form this season particularly in front of their partisan home crowd.

The rebel side, formed in the aftermath of Malcom Glazers takeover at Manchester United, are eyeing their third straight promotion despite only forming in 2005.

Karl Marginsons men are in scintillating form and in 25-goal hit man Rory Patterson boast one of the most fe ared strikers in the division.

Its a big game for the club and I had a meeting this week with Vinnie, Dave Morgan and the rest of the management team about it and were all positive, said Northfield.

Weve heard loads of different reports on how many fans theyre going to bring but I think there will be a crowd of about 1,200 here with about 200 to 300 of our fans who are interested in the game.

They look to be bringing in the region of 900 which will make for a great atmosphere but Im sure our players will rise to the occasion.

They have some good players and Rory Patterson is one but Im sure Vinnie has someone in mind to cope with him.

But were all confident and I think the players will be able to up their game. I think we will win the game 2-1.

The one disadvantage they have is theyre used to playing in front of big crowds every week but our team is not.

I think our players will be more up for the game playing in front of a big crowd than them and I am sure we can use it to our advantage.

Munich and the Making of Manchester United

The Archive Hour - BBC Radio 4 FM
Saturday, 2 February, 2008 - 20:00-21:00

Michael Crick recalls the Munich air disaster of 6th February 1958, in which 23 people, including eight players of Manchester United’s Busby Babes team, lost their lives. Survivors, family members and key figures remember the events of a black day in European soccer history.

The programme also looks at the creation of the Busby Babes and the Manchester United Junior Athletic Club (the MUJACS) and how the club was rebuilt after Munich and has become the biggest football club in the world.

The documentary features rare archive footage, and original comments from the five remaining players who survived the crash: Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Harry Gregg, Albert Scanlon and Kenny Morgans.

Other interviewees include Busby Babe and former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness; Gordon Taylor of the PFA; Matt Busby’s son, Sandy Busby; sports sociologist Dr Gavin Mellor; Mike Jackson, son of the Manchester Evening News journalist, Tom Jackson who died (and is credited with first using the phrase‘Busby Babes’); Andrew Cullis, whose father Stan Cullis, managed Wolves and was a close friend and rival of Matt Busby; former Manchester City goalkeeper, Steve Fleet, who was a close friend of Busby Babe, Eddie Colman.

As the Busby Babes carry on

On Wednesday night FC United will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster with a minutes silence before the match against Woodley Sports at Gigg Lane and Karl Marginsons team will endeavour to play the same style of fast, attacking football that made the Busby Babes famous throughout the world. John Freeman provides this preview

Back in September, this weeks visitors Woodley Sports gained a point in a 1-1 draw at Gigg Lane Rory Patterson scoring the equaliser for FC United. But Woodley have had a patchy first half to the season with a run of indifferent form in the league and currently lie 14th and have won just six games.

As a club they have plenty of potential though. In the 2005/2006 season the Steelmen finish fourth, their highest UniBond League position to date, which gained them a play-off place. However, they lost out against Gresley Rovers in the semi-final.

The Cheshire club finished 10th last season but it was their cup exploits that provided an indication of their true potential. They had their best ever runs in the FA Cup, getting to the Third Qualifying Round and FA Trophy First Round Proper beating Conference North teams Leigh RMI and Moor Green in the process.

Last season also saw a dramatic semi-final exit in the Presidents Cup after a 8-7 defeat on penalties after extra-time away at Premier League side Matlock Town, despite playing over an hour of the game with ten men.

However, last season ended with manager, Ally Pickering departing the club to be replaced by the new management team of Chris Willcock and former Manager John Flanagan.

Recent form has seen Woodley lose the last two to Clitheroe and Newcastle Blue Star but before that they held highflying Bamber Bridge to a 2-2 draw at home, beat Radcliffe Borough 1-0 at Stainton Park and annihilated the self-styled Samba Boys Garforth 4-0 away.

FC United meanwhile come into the game on the back of one of their best runs of the season; winning five out of the last five. With Stuart Rudd, Josh Howard and David Chadwick all making good progress, there is renewed optimism in the camp that the Reds can kick on now for promotion and possibly even, say it quietly, the title.

FC United of Manchester versus Woodley Sports is Wednesday 6th February at Gigg Lane with kick off 7.45pm. Its pay on the gate and usual ticket prices apply. Get yourself to that football ground.

They were knocked out of the FA Trophy by Newcastle Blue Star and by Curzon Ashton in the UniBond Challenge Cup. However, a good run in the FA Cup was ended in the 3rd Qualifying Round by Kendal Town after earlier wins against Mossley, Hallam and Horden.

Two years later the Steelmen won the Second Division Championship in thrilling style on goal difference from Curzon Ashton, winning 12 of their last 13 matches and drawing the other, to take a place in the top flight of the NWCFL.

During the 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 seasons, Woodley consolidated itself in the top half of the NWCFL First Division. However, season 2003/2004 proved to be one of Woodleys best ever, winning the Cheshire FA Senior Cup by beating Witton Albion in the final the first ever NWCFL side to get to the final. And due to FA restructuring they were promoted to the UniBond League in fourth place.

Pyramid also gave Woodley the opportunity to gain promotion by finishing 4th in the League. Having had the Lambeth Grove stadium passed for the UniBond League, the Club became a Limited Company as of 1st August 2004.

In July 2005, the club installed the very latest synthetic surface field turf which reduces postponements and also provided much needed income streams for the club by the hiring of the facilities but means that any home FA Cup matches need to be played elsewhere. Future projects include new floodlights, additional seating and covered standing accommodation as well as a new perimeter fencing along with new treatment rooms for use by players and spectators.

The 2005/2006 season saw Woodley finish 4th (their highest Unibond League position), to gain a play-off place only to lose out against Gresley Rovers. TheGrand February 6th, 2008, 04:10 PM Detail of Postponement

NANTWICH Town boss Steve Davis vowed the club will do all it can to make sure Friday night&apos;s huge clash against FC United goes ahead.

It&apos;s been a frustrating start to 2008 with a combination of the weather and pitch problems forcing nine postponements at the Weaver Stadium.

The Dabbers hope that run doesn&apos;t extend to double figures with a crowd of 1,500 expected for their Presidents Cup quarter-final meeting with the rogue Red Devils.

Trevor Baxter


FC United fans were denied a chance to remember the Munich dead after their Unibond League game against Woodley Sports at Gigg Lane was postponed.

The Rebels believe landlords Bury breached the ground-share agreement between the two clubs.

But Shakers director Iain Mills defended the League Two side&apos;s decision to call off the fixture.

FC United officials attempted to move the Division One North clash to Woodley.

But this proved impossible because of lack of time.

The non leaguers issued a statement last night that said:&quot;The referee declared the pitch fit to play and the match was due to go ahead as scheduled.

&quot;However, a director of Bury FC unilaterally took the decision that he would call off the game.

&quot;FC United believe this to be a breach of our ground-share agreement and we will be seeking further advice.

&quot;A minute&apos;s silence for the 23 people who perished in the Munich tragedy had been planned.&quot;

The club was also denied an opportunity to collect their Unibond club-of-the-month award for their four straight wins in January.

Board member Jules Spencer told M.E.N. Sport:&quot;It was annoying enough that a Bury director took a unilateral decision to postpone the game after the pitch had been passed fit.

&quot;But it was exacerbated by the fact that it was February 6 and supporters had been looking forward to paying their own tributes.

&quot;We know Bury&apos;s games take precedent and Tuesday night&apos;s match had been re-scheduled.

&quot;But we&apos;d been given assurances the club could turn things round within 24 hours and get the ground ready.

&quot;We have a good relationship with the majority of Bury officials who have been helpful to us in the past. But we feel this could have been avoided.&quot;

Bury director Mills insisted the decision was taken for the benefit of both clubs.

Mills said:&quot;It was unrealistic to play three games in five days on the pitch at this time of year.

&quot;At the end of the day, we are the landlords and that gives us the right to cancel games.

&quot;It was taken in the best interests of Bury Football Club and, hopefully, in the best interests of FC United. We have good relations with FC United and I sincerely hope this hasn&apos;t soured them.&quot; TheGrand February 7th, 2008, 04:18 PM Next Stop Mars - (You Cannot Make This UP)

The BBC are reporting that the Premier League are considering extending the league season so that teams can play a match abroad.

This from the BBC website:

The English Premier League is considering playing some matches overseas, BBC Sport has learned.
At a meeting in London on Thursday, all 20 clubs agreed to explore a proposal to extend the season to 39 games.

Those 10 extra games would be played at venues around the world, with cities bidding for the right to stage them.

It is understood the additional fixtures could be determined by a draw but that the top-five teams could be seeded to avoid playing each other.

It is unlikely that any decision will be taken before the Premier Leagues annual summer meeting in June.

Should the proposal get the go-ahead, cities in Asia, Middle East and North America are likely to show a strong interest in hosting the extra games.

BBC Sport believes there would be five venues, with two games - on a Saturday and Sunday - taking place at each one.

By Marc Iles
The Bolton News

FC United could face a points deduction, or even expulsion from the league, in the midst of a bitter row with landlords Bury.

The Rebel Reds are likely to face an enquiry from the UniBond League to assess whether they failed to fulfil their midweek game against Woodley Sports.

League chiefs will meet on Sunday to look into the matter, which has already descended into a potentially repairable war of words between the two clubs.

FC United allege that Bury were in breach of contract after postponing Wednesday night&apos;s fixture - scheduled just 24 hours after the Shakers&apos; League Two clash with Stockport County - at the last minute.

Bury director Iain Mills claimed his club sent confirmation that the game would be called off 15 days earlier, because of the need to reorganise their own tie with Stockport, and that the decision was completely within the realms of their original agreement.

His words, issued in an official club statement, prompted an acidic response from the Rebels, who branded his claim&quot;categorically untrue.&quot;They also asked that the story be removed from the official website.

Bury stuck to their guns, and are now understood to have provided official correspondence to the UniBond League to help with their enquiry.

League secretary Phil Bradley said:&quot;We will review the situation on Sunday. If we find that FC United have failed to fulfil a fixture, then there are several options available to us.

&quot;The worst case, though extremely unlikely, would be expulsion. We could also, if found guilty, impose a fine or points deduction.&quot;

Mills defended the decision not to allow the fixture to be played, claiming the pitch could not stand up to two games in 48 hours at this time of year.

He said:&quot;The damage at this time of year takes a lot longer to repair. We saw last year what a mess the pitch got when a game was allowed against Barnet on December 30 and that was to the detriment of both clubs.

&quot;We know the pitch better than anyone. We are the custodians of that ground and it is up to us to make sure it is playable all year round.

&quot;I sincerely hope FC United can sort this situation out, but we will not be blamed in this matter.&quot; TheGrand February 11th, 2008, 01:43 PM Cancellation of 6th February Fixture

FC United have spoken to Bury FC about the events leading up the game being called off on Wednesday 6th February.

FC United now accept that an email was sent on January 22nd and therefore retract the accusation, made in all honesty at the time that such a claim was categorically untrue.

The reason for the error was that subsequent to receipt of the e-mail, assurances were received that the pitch would be available for our match against Woodley Sports; weather and pitch condition permitting. Given the relevance of the date of the fixture and concern about Burys game on the 5th of February, FC United sought yet further clarification. Assurances were repeated that both the pitch and the ground itself could be prepared in time.

In accepting that Bury FC did contact FC United by email on January 22nd and if, as is being claimed, this email represents communication of the decision to cancel our game FC United would like answers to the following questions:

- Why were subsequent assurances given?
- Why was there no indication of this postponement given to FC United officials by our Bury counterparts at our Gigg Lane fixture on 26 January?
- Why were Bury stewards only informed of the postponement during Burys fixture on February 5th?
- Why was the pitch inspection allowed to go ahead?
- Why was the 22nd January decision not mentioned to FC United representatives at said inspection?
- Why is there no reference to the 22nd January decision in the letter from Bury FC dated February 6th, in which the match is formally called off by Bury FC?

On the morning of the 6th February the referee passed the pitch fit to play and Burys own staff were as surprised as we were when the game was called off.

It is now in the interests of both clubs that this matter is resolved quickly and a meeting between FC United and Bury FC is scheduled for early next week.

Now, we all know how over-excited that particular marketing department gets, but then again there are pundits and players a-plenty queuing up to repeatedly inform everyone that England boasts the&quot;best league in the world&quot;.

If that&apos;s the case, then God help us all.

In this match - one which summed up all that is wrong with modern football - there were more holding midfielders on the pitch than central strikers. Javier Mascherano, Lucas and Claude Makelele negated each other in the centre of the park, Nicolas Anelka and Peter Crouch stood and watched. Both teams had clearly set themselves up first and foremost not to get beaten; if either nicked a goal, then all good and well.

Avram Grant and Rafael Benitez&apos;s tactical plans obviously worked: there was one shot on target in the entire match. Well done, Avram! Well done, Rafa! But there is a reason televised chess never took off. When sport becomes this tedious, something has gone horribly wrong somewhere down the line.

Liverpool, for example, may care to consider the attitudes of holding players of yore: Graeme Souness scored roughly one goal in six. Steve McMahon roughly one in seven. Mascherano has never scored a club goal in his career; two goals for Argentina, and that&apos;s it. Though whether this is Mascherano&apos;s fault is moot: you can bet your bottom dollar Souness and McMahon didn&apos;t have to suppress any attacking instinct to the whims of a tactical&quot;genius&quot;moving their pawns around from the bench.

This defence-at-all-costs attitude is ruining everything. Shall we compare and contrast the&quot;best of the Premier League&quot;with the African Cup of Nations, where midfielders pushed on, teams fielded at least two up front, and the wingbacks pressed forward? Actually let&apos;s not. It&apos;s far too depressing. Players were beating men and taking shots, for goodness sake.

There have always been terrible games. But it didn&apos;t matter when fans could get in for a fiver, stand up, sing and enjoy the banter. As scales fall from eyes across the country, surely the popularity of splinter clubs such as AFC Wimbledon and FC United will become ever greater.

Let&apos;s not be totally negative, though; some good can come of this. A couple more seasons of matches cut from this cloth, and fans in Bangkok, Bangalore or Beijing will rather chew tin foil than want any of our teams coming over and stinking the place out. So perhaps the integrity of our league will be saved after all. Shame the action isn&apos;t likely to get better any time soon. TheGrand February 18th, 2008, 06:04 PM Rebels march on

18/ 2/2008

FC UNITED manager Karl Marginson challenged his rampant Rebels to secure a third successive title after they&apos;d knocked Skelmersdale off the top of UniBond first division north.

Two Rory Patterson goals followed by a late strike by sub Nick Robinson saw FC step up their championship assault with a resounding 3-0 triumph over the league leaders in front of a Gigg Lane crowd of 2,168.

That enabled Bamber Bridge to replace Skem at the summit with a 2-1 victory over fellow title hopefuls Bradford Park Avenue which means Marginson&apos;s men can now overtake all of the six teams ahead of them.

&quot;It&apos;s a tall order because we have a massive fixture backlog, but I firmly believe we can do it,&quot;said the Rebels chief, whose on-song side visit Nantwich in the UniBond President&apos;s Cup quarter-finals tonight at 7.45pm.

Meanwhile, Curzon Ashton&apos;s hopes of returning to pole position were thwarted when their derby date at relegation-haunted Radcliffe was postponed.

It was a miserable day for Vodkat League title contenders Salford City, who crashed out of the League Cup, beaten 2-0 at Winsford, and were also replaced at the top by Newcastle, thumping 10-1 winners over hapless Nelson.

By Liam Chronnell

IT is unusual for a footballer to embody what their club stands for quite as much as FC United&apos;s Rob Nugent.

The Atherton-born defender has made the second highest number of appearances for the breakaway club, formed in 2005 by disenchanted Manchester United supporters following the takeover by American billionaire Malcolm Glazer.

Nugent was one of those fans who took to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction at the Premiership giants.

From the ashes of those protests rose FC United and, following two title-winning seasons, the UniBond League Division One North outfit are now chasing a third successive promotion.

The 25-year-old centre-back, a former Sheffield United trainee, has played a central role in that success; the only player in the current squad who figured in the Rebels&apos; first ever game - a friendly at Leigh RMI on July 16, 2005 - and one of only two, Rory Patterson being the other, to make more than a century of appearances for the club.

And Nugent, a former Bolton School pupil, is delighted to have played such a significant part in the Reds&apos; short history.

&quot;It&apos;s a dream really,&quot;he said.&quot;As a young lad growing up you want to play for Manchester United if you are a United fan. This is the next best thing.

&quot;When it was announced the Glazer&apos;s were taking over at Old Trafford I was involved in the protests, and I was there from the first meeting when there was talk of FC United being formed.

&quot;I put my name down to be involved in any capacity I could, but it wasn&apos;t until one of my friends mentioned I used to play for Sheffield United that (FC manager) Karl Marginson got in contact.

&quot;The whole thing was very close to my heart because I was a big United fan. I was not happy with the way football was going in general, not just at United but at other Premiership clubs with lots of foreign owners coming in and pricing normal fans out of the game.

&quot;At FC it&apos;s 7 to get in and 2 for children; obviously it&apos;s not the same level of football but it&apos;s a better atmosphere.&quot;

Nugent, whose father, Steve, used to play for Atherton LR, looked to have a bright future in the game after spending four years at Sheffield United.

But after being released from Bramall Lane at the age of 20, he spent two seasons playing for Ossett Town in the UniBond Premier Division. However, he had little hesitation in making the switch to FC when the chance arose.

He explained:&quot;When the opportunity to play for FC United came, even though it was four levels below what I was playing at, I jumped at the chance.

&quot;I used to play in front of 60 people at Ossett, now it&apos;s 2,000 every week. I remember the last game at home in our first season; there was 6,000 there. It was phenomenal.&quot;

The Rebels, who play their home games at Bury&apos;s Gigg Lane, are eight points behind leaders Bamber Bridge with three games in hand.

Through to the semi-finals and quarter-finals of two cup competitions, United look set for another trophy-laden season - but it wasn&apos;t always that way.

Back in November, after an unprecedented four defeats in five games, FC&apos;s critics were quick to suggest the club had reached its plateau. After successive promotions, it was suggested the Reds&apos; balloon had finally burst.

Nugent, a trainee accountant at Trafford Borough Council, admitted:&quot;It was the first blip we&apos;d really had but it coincided with us coming into the UniBond.

&quot;The teams are bigger and more physical in this league, but we&apos;ve got the players to play at this level. A lot of our players have dropped down the leagues to play for FC so there&apos;s no reason why we shouldn&apos;t do well in this league, or the leagues above.

&quot;This club can go as far as the fans want to take it. We&apos;ve had two promotions in two seasons; who&apos;s to say we can&apos;t make that three in three, four in four.&quot;

And has Nugent been back to watch his beloved Manchester United?&quot;I&apos;ve not been this season at all,&quot;he said.&quot;I went once or twice last year, but it just wasn&apos;t the same buzz as when I used to go when I was growing up. It&apos;s the same at a lot of modern-day grounds. I&apos;m from Bolton, and you only need to look at some of the crowds Wanderers are getting at their home games - they should be much bigger with better atmospheres, but they&apos;re just not.&quot;

A true believer in what FC stands for, Rob Nugent is surely the ultimate clubman. TheGrand February 20th, 2008, 08:50 PM Rebel Reds aiming to kit out overseas poor

By Staff Reporter

STAFF at Bury-based football club FC United of Manchester are asking kind-hearted soccer fans to do their bit to help poorer people overseas.

The team, who play their home games at Gigg Lane, want fans from all teams to donate their old football kits so they can be sent to children and adults from some of the poorest parts of the world.

Anyone wanting to help has plenty of time to get their kits ready - they will be collected at Gigg Lane between 1pm and 3pm on March 15, before United play Newcastle Blue Star.

Kits are also being collected at the club&apos;s office at 5th Floor, Hope Mill, 113 Pollard Street, Ancoats, Manchester, during business hours on the week of the game.

FC&apos;s general manager Andy Walsh said:&quot;In 2006, our supporters donated more than 300 shirts to KitAid and we want to do even better this time around. We are appealing to our supporters to clear out their cupboards and donate any clean unwanted football kit, including shirts, shorts and socks to the appeal.

&quot;KitAid is a registered charity, created in 1998, which donates unwanted football shirts to children and adults across Africa, India, Eastern Europe and other developing countries.&quot; heatonparkincakes February 22nd, 2008, 12:03 PM Grand and other football architecture people If and when FC United have their own ground, is this project in Leigh the future.

And given that there is very few plots of land in Manchester that are big enough or cheap enough, FC&apos;s membership will go for somewhere which will also be within a re-gen area.

Cant see FC being reduced to be a re-gen project, but I can see how the club can enormously benefit if it is the focus of such a development.

FC UNITED chief Karl Marginson was left frustrated as the Rebels were held by 10-man Bamber Bridge.

Marginson&apos;s men dominated for long spells of a tense UniBond First Division North promotion battle.

Yet it was Brig who came closest to snatching an against-the-odds victory after they had been hit by Matt Mahoney&apos;s 59th-minute dismissal.

FC&apos;s best opportunity fell to Rory Patterson, but his superbly-struck free-kick was brilliantly saved by home keeper Terry McCormick.

&quot;It was a useful point but under the circumstances, we&apos;d have liked all three,&quot;Marginson said.

&quot;We just didn&apos;t have enough about us to make the extra man count.&quot;
The Irongate stalemate keeps FC lurking dangerously in seventh place, while enabling Curzon Ashton to leapfrog Bamber Bridge into second.

Rebels look for crucial win

By Neil Bonnar

FC United will aim to put Monday night&apos;s horror show at Nantwich behind them when they meet Clitheroe at Gigg Lane tonight.

Karl Marginson&apos;s men crashed out of the UniBond League President&apos;s Cup with a 5-1 quarter-final mauling.

But they must bounce straight back tonight to put the momentum back into their bid for promotion from the UniBond Division One North.

FC drew 0-0 with fellow promotion hopefuls Bamber Bridge in the league on Saturday to leave them two points adrift of the play-offs with games in hand.

The Rebels will be favourites to beat fourth-bottom Clitheroe at home tonight, but they will have to avoid a repeat of the defensive frailties which saw them crumble after taking the lead at Nantwich. TheGrand February 27th, 2008, 12:01 PM http://fcumfiles.co.uk/splash_pics/yud.jpg

AN eighth minute Simon Carden strike accompanied by a Rory Patterson brace, over-shadowed Clitheroe&apos;s endeavour at Gigg Lane on Wednesday night.

FC United were as impressive as ever on the counter attack with their sweeping, accurate play, but not three goals better than the Blues who had their own fair share of chances on goal.

Scott Redhead was in impressive form again with balls from the wing, and before the home side took the lead, Gary Jackson had a header tipped away by Aaron Grundy.

But again Clitheroe conceded another poor early goal when a ball over the top wasn&apos;t dealt with at more than one opportunity, flicked forward to the byline and then laid across the box for Carden to tuck away and leave the Blues in disarray.

The rest of the first half proved even enough between the two sides. Redhead had successive crosses into the box, one of which saw Joel Pilkington have a chance cleared off the line.

Then after United&apos;s Stuart Rudd crossed perfectly for Jerome Wright only for the forward to put wide from six yards out.

And James Mann warmed himself up for a starling second half display by keeping out Chris Baguley at his near post.

Carl Lomax struck a solid volley from the edge of the area that Grundy had to tip out for a corner.

Gary Jackson made way for Danny Toronczak at half-time, the forward suffering from a swollen knee, but it was United striker Patterson who found the net in the 60th minute with a well-driven free kick.

The Gigg Lane leading scorer lamped the ball home from just outside the area with a clear sight of goal, straight past an ineffective wall and a rooted Mann.

FC United continued to be rampant on the break and would have netted more if not for Mann pulling off some fantastic saves.

But the Blues sustained their own period of pressure in the home half and should really have done better when a move involving the fresh legs of substitute John Osborne, Redhead, David Hankin and Lomax resulted in the latter having a shot cleared off the line.

The Blues almost tried to walk the ball into the back of the net in the second half, while United swept forward with inch perfect balls that their pacey strikers thrived on. One, two three passes was all it took to unlock a path on goal as Jonathan Smith, Paul Osborne and Russ Clarke were kept busy.

A fantastic right wing cross from 14 traversed the width of the pitch to find its man, Chris Bauley at the back post, whose shot on goal was blocked out by Mann who then dived across goal to deny Patterson what should have been an easy rebound.

And the Clitheroe keeper almost denied Patterson again for his second goal when another raking move resulted in Wright laying the ball across goal for his strike partner at the back post. Mann got a hand to it but couldn&apos;t prevent United&apos;s 90th minute third goal. TheGrand February 28th, 2008, 03:20 PM FC United General Meeting 2008

FANS of Goole AFC are being urged to turn out in huge numbers with FC United of Manchester visiting next weekend after a change to the cup draw.

At a UniBond League Cups&apos; Committee hearing last Thursday, Nantwich Town - who Goole were set to play against in the Presidents Cup semi final - have been disqualified for fielding an ineligible player in their quarter final tie against FC United of Manchester.

As a result they will now visit the Victoria Pleasure Grounds on March 8, in what will be one of the biggest attendances seen in Goole for years.

And assistant manager Mick Norbury is calling on the whole of the town to attend the match to support the team.

He said:&quot;They will bring a minimum of 800-1,000 fans and it will an amazing atmosphere with it being a semi final.

&quot;We need all our fans behind us because with the number of fans they bring it will be like a home tie for them.

&quot;But our fans can be fantastic and there was a group of 20-30 away at Sheffield who never shut up singing, even when we went a man down and that is what spurred the lads on to get a result.

&quot;It gives you an extra ten per cent and we need everybody to get behind the lads, because they deserve it.&quot;

Spice has also been added to the game with Mick revealing that interviews following the match with fans and players of FC United of Manchester, after they lost to Nantwich, labelled Goole a long ball side.

He explained:&quot;They said they didn&apos;t want to come to Goole anyway because we were a side of cloggers.

&quot;That is disrespectful to the players and I think people assume that because me and Nigel Danby are in charge.

&quot;But that is not the case and it gives us even more motivation to beat them and play them off the park.&quot;

The winners of the tie will face Ossett Albion or Radcliffe Borough.

Mick added:&quot;It is not about the money and revenue but the opportunity for the lads to play in that kind of atmosphere.

&quot;I remember coming to Goole 20 years ago when Terry Curran was manager and they were in the equivalent of the Conference league.

&quot;We want to bring back the glory days and Goole has been up there so lets have another crack at doing it.&quot; TheGrand March 1st, 2008, 01:56 AM Curzon boss warns Rebels

CURZON Ashton boss Gary Lowe has warned FC United that they have a big fight on their hands if they&apos;re to capture a third successive league title.

FC are back up to fifth in UniBond Division One North after Wednesday&apos;s 3-0 win over Clitheroe and will be seeking to make further headway when they entertain third-placed Bamber Bridge tomorrow.

But Curzon, who trail leaders Skelmersdale only on goal difference, boast a nine-point lead over the Rebels ahead of their home clash with Newcastle Blue Star, in which they&apos;ll be looking to post a third victory in eight days.

And, even though FC would go top were they to win the games in hand they have on Curzon and the rest of the teams above them, Lowe believes that&apos;s asking a lot of Karl Marginson&apos;s men given the fixture glut they now face.

Lowe, whose team tried and failed to catch the Rebels when the roles were reversed in the North West Counties League last term, said:&quot;FC United are a good side, but it&apos;s nevertheless going to be tough for them playing catch-up at this stage of the season.

&quot;We know from experience how hard that is and, with respect to the North West Counties, it&apos;s a lot more difficult stringing wins together in this division, as FC United are now faced with doing, than it is in that league.&quot; TheGrand March 1st, 2008, 01:58 AM http://fcumfiles.co.uk/images/bbh.jpg

Preview: FC United v Bamber Bridge

29/ 2/2008

STRIKER Rory Patterson may not have made the grade as a teenager at Rochdale, but FC United&apos;s manager Karl Marginson is convinced the 23-year-old has a future in the professional game.

He hopes that will be with the Rebels, who have already won back-to-back titles with Patterson in their ranks and are chasing a third.

Their hopes of landing the Unibond first division north began to look shaky after a 0-0 draw with rivals Bamber Bridge, which was then followed by a 5-1 defeat at Nantwich in the President&apos;s Cup on Monday.

But a 3-0 win over Clitheroe put them back on course ahead of tomorrow&apos;s home clash with Brig.

It helps having a striker as prolific as Patterson, who has scored 29 goals in all competitions this season. Those goals have proved crucial in the absence of Stuart Rudd for much of the campaign.

&quot;Anybody who watches us regularly knows Rory is a special talent,&quot;said Marginson, whose side are unbeaten in eight matches in the league.

&quot;He creates goals, scores goals, links play well, he&apos;s strong, quick, good in the air and has got two good feet.

&quot;I have no doubt that if he wants to, he could play in the League. He was at Rochdale as a junior and was their young player of the year as a 17-year-old, but for some reason they released him.

&quot;After that he was having some problems dealing with life outside football and it has taken a couple of years to get him back on track, but he&apos;s been a dream to have in the side.

Tomorrow&apos;s game at Gigg Lane will have free admission to under-18s, with the club also promoting healthy eating. TheGrand March 4th, 2008, 12:14 PM FC United 2 Bamber Bridge 2

FC UNITED&apos;S hopes of a third successive league title suffered a body-blow as they were held by UniBond Division One North promotion foes Bamber Bridge in front of a Gigg Lane crowd of 3,348.

But it would have been worse for fifth-placed FC, whose offer of free admission to under-18s resulted in a bumper attendance, had Chris Baguley not saved their bacon with a spectacular injury-time equaliser.

Baguley struck from 30 yards to rescue a point for the Rebels after they had twice trailed to Alex Porter goals, the second of which arrived with just a minute left on the clock.

Simon Carden netted FC&apos;s first equaliser, firing home from close-range, but they were staring defeat in the face when Baguley salvaged a draw which means they now trail the top two, Skelmersdale and Curzon Ashton, by 11 points.

But FC United have been reinstated to the UniBond League President&apos;s Cup after their quarter-final conquerors Nantwich were thrown out for fielding an ineligible player in their 5-1 victory.

Karl Marginson&apos;s men will now visit Goole in the semis on Saturday. TheGrand March 4th, 2008, 12:21 PM Youth United Day a Great Success

FC United 3 Curzon Ashton 2

RORY Patterson once again proved FC United&apos;s matchwinner as they cut the gap on leaders Skelmersdale to nine points with a crucial victory against title rivals Curzon Ashton.

The prolific striker struck twice to hand the Rebels, who have four games in hand on the leaders, the points in an entertaining UniBond Division One North clash at Gigg Lane.

Curzon hit the woodwork three times before Patterson handed United the lead in first-half injury time when he finished off a flowing FC move.

The visitors were level just 27 seconds after the restart when the division&apos;s top scorer, Michael Norton, headed home his 35th goal of the season.

But United captain Dave Chadwick restored the breakaway club&apos;s advantage on 55 minutes.

FC old boy Rhodri Giggs, brother of Manchester United star Ryan, came back to haunt his former club when he levelled on 69 minutes.

But Patterson&apos;s 31st goal of the season four minutes later secured the points for the Rebels, who could have points docked when they go before league officials tonight after being charged with failing to fulfil a fixture last month.

As it stands, FC are fourth, two points behind Bamber Bridge with a game in hand and eight behind Curzon with three games in hand. TheGrand March 10th, 2008, 11:17 PM Rebels fined after pitch row

8/ 3/2008

FC UNITED have been fined for failing to play a home fixture that was called off by landlords Bury.

The UniBond League have hit FC with a 500 penalty for not fulfilling their First Division North game against Woodley Sports at Gigg Lane on February 6.

FC have also been ordered to pay 65 towards the cost of the hearing - but the club has not been deducted any points.

The postponement caused controversy at the time, with the club issuing a statement in the aftermath accusing a Bury director of calling off the game after the pitch had passed a referee&apos;s inspection.

FC fans were also frustrated because the postponement denied them the chance of a public tribute to the Munich dead on the 50th anniversary of the air disaster.

But Shakers director Iain Mills, who has since resigned from the board over an unrelated matter, defended the postponement, arguing that it was in the best interests of both Bury and FC United as the game would have been the third in five days at Gigg Lane. TheGrand March 10th, 2008, 11:19 PM Red rebels in the pink

FC UNITED seized on their UniBond Presidents Cup reprieve to secure a place in the final with a 3-1 win at AFC Goole.

The Rebels were reinstated after their quarter-final conquerors Nantwich were thrown out for fielding an ineligible player.

And FC made the most of their unexpected opportunity with two Chris Baguley goals - one of them a shot from 40 yards - plus another from Rory Patterson taking them sailing through a semi which was spoiled by a strong wind.

FC&apos;s opponents in the final will be neighbours Radcliffe, who they also meet in the Manchester Premier Cup semis.

Struggling Boro again shrugged off their poor league form to book a final ticket with a 1-0 win at Ossett Albion courtesy of Craig Dawson&apos;s scrambled 26th minute strike.

Meanwhile, to add to FC&apos;s joy, their division one north title hopes were also given a double boost as big rivals Curzon Ashton and Bamber Bridge, both lost.

Second-placed Curzon&apos;s 2-1 defeat at Clitheroe came as a bitter blow as they went down to a last-minute goal against 10-men.

Jorg Diaz gave Curzon a 20th minute lead, but Clitheroe hit back to deny them a chance to go top.

Trafford maintained their eight-point lead over second-placed Salford in the Vodkat League with goals by Chris Mackay and Kayden Coppin giving them a 2-0 derby victory over Maine Road. TheGrand March 20th, 2008, 06:03 PM Carden keeps Rebels on target

17/ 3/2008

FC UNITED chief Karl Marginson conceded the Rebels were fortunate to step up their UniBond first division north championship assault with a 3-2 home victory over Newcastle Blue Star.

Sub Simon Carden&apos;s injury-time winner got FC out of jail after they&apos;d squandered an early two-goal lead.Rory Patterson&apos;s double had put Marginson&apos;s men in control inside the first quarter.

But FC then allowed the visitors to draw level with two late goals before Carden&apos;s last-gasp strike secured a win which takes them to within nine points of leaders Skelmersdale, who crashed 1-0 to fellow title challengers Bradford Park Avenue.

&quot;We very nearly shot ourselves in the foot, so, in the end, it turned out to be a massive three points for us,&quot;said Marginson, whose fifth-placed side will go top if they win their games in hand.

&quot;We were by no means at our best, but credit to the boys for responding so well after Newcastle had equalised with just seven minutes left.&quot;

Meanwhile, second-placed Curzon Ashton wasted a chance to close the gap on Skem as they went down 1-0 at Garforth.

Premier leaders Witton remain firmly on course for the title and automatic promotion to Blue Square North despite being held 1-1 at Guiseley, but Ashton United&apos;s relegation fears returned with a vengeance in a 5-2 defeat at Eastwood.

Trafford maintained their firm grip on top spot in the Vodkat League with Scott Barlow&apos;s hat-trick helping them sink rock-bottom Nelson 4-2. TheGrand March 20th, 2008, 06:04 PM Boro end Rebels&apos; treble dreams

By Marc Higginson

Radcliffe Borough 3 FC United 1
RADCLIFFE Borough booked a second cup final appearance of the season with a well-earned victory over neighbours FC United.

Boro had to come from behind after Chris Baguley&apos;s 25-yard strike had put the treble-chasing Rebels in front on 32 minutes in the Manchester Cup semi-final clash at Stainton Park.

That was tough on Radcliffe, who hit the bar twice before their high-flying UniBond Division One North rivals had opened the scoring.

But Peter Coyne&apos;s side roared back after the break and were level within four minutes when Steve Howson smashed home the rebound after goalkeeper Sam Ashton could only parry Tony Whealing&apos;s free-kick.

Boro, rooted to the bottom of the table, took the lead on 59 minutes when Michael Oates tapped home Whealing&apos;s cross from the left.

And victory was sealed nine minutes later when Oates outstripped his marker to add a third and set up a final showdown with Blue Square North outfit Hyde United at Oldham Athletic&apos;s Boundary Park ground. TheGrand March 20th, 2008, 06:06 PM MANCAT-FC United win Northern Conference

Congratulations to MANCATs FC United youth team who have won the FCYL Northern Conference.

FC United of Manchester recorded a fantastic 6-0 away victory over MMU/Newcastle on the 5th of March to seal the Championship with two games in hand.

Reds ready for Radcliffe revenge

FC United will be looking for revenge this Saturday when they take on relegation threatened Radcliffe Borough at Gigg Lane. Boro dumped the Reds out of the Manchester Premier Cup on Tuesday night at the semi-final stage but United would surely prefer three points in the league given the option.

Basement boys Boro deservedly ran out 3-1 winners at Stainton Park earlier in the week and despite them being at opposite ends of the UniBond Division One North table, United are yet to beat Radcliffe in three meetings since our clubs formation in summer 2005.

Despite the poor result in mid-week, United are still unbeaten in the league since November, a run which stretches to 11 matches, so confidence should still be high in the squad. Manager Karl Marginson has said many times before that FC United aim to win every game that they play in but there is no doubt that gaining victories in the league in a bid to push towards a third consecutive title is the main objective.

Captain David Chadwick will be back to bolster United after being rested on Tuesday night due to him recently returning from a serious knee ligament injury. Last seasons top scorer, Stuart Rudd suffered a similar injury but he was given a run out to build his fitness up.

The formidable Chadwick seems to have eased back into matches effortlessly whereas Rudd has struggled with the pace of recent games on his road to recover. Margy is not concerned by this though. He said: Its completely different for a centre-back and a striker. Chaddy can watch the game, marshal the defence, win his headers and so on but when a chance falls to a striker they have a split second to get it right.

Stuart has just got to keep on working at getting that sharpness back and the only way that will come is by getting more matches under his belt. As soon as he gets that first goal in a match that hes started; Im sure that theyll start to fly in. Someone of his goal-scoring ability does lose that over night.

FC United continue their push for the UniBond Division One North title on Saturday against Radcliffe Borough at Gigg Lane. Its a 3pm kick off and usual entrance fees apply. Get yourself to that football ground. Deanuk March 22nd, 2008, 01:54 AM Come on Bury!

Simon Carden rescued a point with a late equaliser as FC United were held at home 2-2 by bottom of the league side, Radcliffe Borough on Saturday in front of 2,163 supporters at Gigg Lane.

Relegation threatened Borough have firmly established themselves as the Reds bogey team as the title chasers have failed to beat them on three attempts so far this season.

With games in hand the title is still in Uniteds hands, however, they will have to do much better than they did on Saturday if they are going to convert the games into points and their hopes into reality.

The Reds looked completely out of sorts in the first half and Radcliffe could easily have taken a comfortable lead into the break had it not been for some fine smothering saves by Sam Ashton and a slice of good fortune.

As it was the visitors had a one goal lead by half time with Steve Howson slotting the ball home after going through one-on-one with Ashton. Borough had earlier had one disallowed for off-side and later saw another effort narrowly deflected round the post.

Margy obviously gave his side a rollicking at half-time because two minutes into the second half Jerome Wright and Josh Howard combined to grab an equaliser in front of the Manchester Road End.

United then began to play some of the football that has got them where they are today. Stuart Rudd fired one agonisingly wide of the far post after surging into the right hand side of the box. Howard, Wright, Carden and Patterson were proving to be a handful but Radcliffe were digging in and getting men behind the ball to limit them to half chances.

Then, almost inevitably, with the vast majority of the second half action in the visitors half, Borough struck one on the counter attack with Howson again calmly picking his spot and finishing with aplomb inside the box.

Despite the setback, United had been playing some good football and there was a sense that a goal was coming. Patterson was making a nuisance of himself down the right and he lifted a ball in to just inside the box. It should have been dealt with by the Radcliffe defence but Carden was on hand to steal in, flicked the ball forward with one touch and hammer it home on the half volley with his second. Another fine goal from Uniteds midfield maestro.

Patterson came close to stealing victory when he fired a free-kick just wide of the right up-right with Phil Priestly beaten. Radcliffe were probably just about worth the draw though and United must turn their attentions to Monday and a trip to Woodley Sports.

Woodley Sports 1 FC United 2

STUART Rudd helped FC get their title bid back on track with a spectacular late winner against Woodley Sports.

After only drawing with basement club Radcliffe Borough at the weekend, the Rebels were in danger of losing further ground on the leaders with the game locked at 1-1 with just three minutes left.

But substitute Rudd saved the visitors with a brilliant overhead kick to keep the pressure on top-of-the-table Skelmersdale, who are 11 points in front having played five games more than the Reds.

Second-bottom Woodley took a shock lead two minutes after the break, before Jamie Baguley levelled matters on 67 minutes to set up a grandstand finish.

26/ 3/2008

KARL Marginson branded FC United the new invincibles of the UniBond first division north as they continue to push for a third successive title at home to Chorley.

A 2-2 draw with Radcliffe Borough, followed by a 2-1 win against Woodley Sports on Monday, leaves the Rebels 11 points behind leaders Skelmersdale, but with five games in hand.

It was an impressive response after the 3-1 Manchester Premier Cup defeat by Radcliffe last week.

And Marginson is looking for them to make up more ground on the leaders when they face Chorley at Gigg Lane on Wednesday, part of a punishing schedule of 15 games in five weeks.

&quot;We&apos;ve got that inner belief and we&apos;ve got to keep encouraging them,&quot;he said.

&quot;They believe they are invincible at the moment.

&quot;There will still be some twists and turns, especially with all our fixtures coming up, but it is in our own hands now.&quot; TheGrand March 28th, 2008, 02:52 PM Karl in the Community

A new section has been added to the Community menu of this site in which a regular update of Karl in the Community articles will appear, blog stylee. Keep an eye on http://www.fc-utd.co.uk/karl.php for the latest news. To get you started here is the first installment...

The Co-Op Treble featuring Chatman&amp;Robin
Those of you familiar with the rules of FC United of Manchester will know that the word community crops up quite a lot, fifteen times in total including seven times within the phrase benefit of the community. In order for FCUM to do what it says in the tin (yes, the rule book is kept in a tin), the club is committed to a policy of inclusion which makes it and the matches it takes part in accessible to the whole of the community and in particular sections of the society which are currently under represented in football.
The role of the community development officer is vital to our progress as a football club so not only does Karl Marginson have his work cut out trying to win us promotions, league titles and trophies he also has to work hard in his day job to ensure we achieve our off-field goals too. Karl is backed up by popular chatterbox Vinny Thompson and Robin Pye. Vinnys superb communications skills include an impressive telephone voice that is so polished one can often be fooled into thinking that one is speaking to the queen herself. Robin, whos name strikes fear into local bakers, is an unsung hero amongst our army of volunteers and his excellent links to local schools have proved crucial in the success of our community work.

Its all at the Co-op now!
The Co-Operative Group is a great British Institution which started from a shop in Rochdale over 160 years ago. Like FC United it is member owned and now provides a variety of services including food, healthcare, travel, funeral care and financial services. The Co-Op places importance on ethical issues and supporting local communities is at the heart of its values, so it was one of FCs best results so far when the invaluable work of Vinny helped by Karl and Robin secured almost 10000 to fund some of our community work. This covered the three initiatives Healthy Eating Teaching Materials, the Community Cohesion Project and Youth United Day.

Karls Cootie Catcher
Anyone who has spoken to Karl Marginson will know that he is an excellent people person and is good company amongst young or old alike, such is his ability to get on the same wavelength of anyone he his communicating with. For the Healthy Eating project it was the kids that Karl got tuned in with. The objective was to produce a paper fortune teller that would engage primary school children with a kinaesthetic learning style and deliver the message of the importance of healthy eating. As a child you may remember making a fortune teller yourself from a square piece of paper which was folded a certain way and marked with numbers and colours which would ultimately reveal your destiny. Karls design carries the FCUM logo and several healthy eating messages; there is also blank space for the children to fill in their own healthy eating ideas in order to give them some ownership of the concept. Four thousand of the fortune tellers were produced to be distributed amongst primary schools and junior football clubs in Tameside, Salford, North Manchester, Bury and North Trafford and also to children attending FC matches. If youre too cool or grown up to admit to remembering these mystic devices it was the thing that Butters was made to steal from the girls sleepover in a episode of South Park.

FCCCP (Dont panic! its not lefty political propaganda).
The aim of FCs Community Cohesion Project is to build on the work our club has already done in our efforts to attract socially excluded groups to games. We dont want to change the world (just yet) but initiatives such as this one can change the way a football club can impact on the local community. Some of the diverse organisations the club have worked with include:

Northerncare - an organisation running homes for young people in the North West.

Children&amp;Families Refugee&amp;Asylum Seeker Service (CAFRASS) - a Greater Manchester organisation working with asylum seekers.

St. Peters Youth - organisers of Asian male and female youth football teams.
The club is to extend this work by reaching out to more organisations that work with minority or socially excluded groups that currently do not get involved in football our goal being the improvement of community cohesion in the areas we serve.

Margy has set up coaching sessions with these partner organisations and arrangements will be made to bring each group to one of our games later this season and in the early part of next season.

Youth United Day
A fantastic success and easily the biggest buzz around Gigg Lane this season. More on Youth United Day in the next Karl in the Community piece. During the meantime, if you got a spare 5 hours, ask Vinny about next time you see him at the game. TheGrand March 28th, 2008, 02:54 PM FC United 3 Chorley 0

27/ 3/2008
FC UNITED stepped up their bid for a third successive title by brushing UniBond division one north relegation battlers Chorley aside at Gigg Lane.

And yet again their hero was ace marksman Rory Patterson, who struck twice to take his goals tally in the league to 30. Patterson fired promotion-chasing FC in front after just eight minutes but had to wait until five minutes after the restart to add his second when he swept home Jerome Wright&apos;s pinpoint cross from the left.

Stuart Rudd capped a fine display by adding the third goal to take the Rebels into fourth place behind Curzon.

They now trail leaders Skelmersdale by eight points but have four games in hand on the Merseysiders. TheGrand March 28th, 2008, 02:57 PM http://fcumfiles.co.uk/images/lanchfix.jpg

Margy confident after &apos;performance of the season&apos;

Manager Karl Marginson is in confident mood ahead of the visit of Lancaster City to Gigg Lane this Saturday especially considering the manner in which Chorley were dispatched on Wednesday night.

FC United are unbeaten in 14 league games and are now in fourth spot just eight points behind top-of-the-table Skelmersdale United with four games in hand.

Margy was delighted with the result and the way his team conducted themselves against Chorley. He said: It was probably one of our best performances of the season, especially in past few weeks. Weve looked a bit desperate at times but weve kept plugging away.

On Wednesday, I thought we worked real hard, kept the ball very well and we took our chances. Having said that I thought we possibly should have scored more but Ive got no complaints as it keeps our run going. Its now 14 games unbeaten in the league and thats very impressive, we just need to kick on from here now in what is going to be a hectic schedule.

Margy was very keen to phrase his winger Jerome Wright after his recent run of form. Wright provided the assist in Uniteds first two goals on Wednsday night. He said: I could watch him play all day long. The way he gets the ball and starts running at people its poetry in motion. The balls he puts across the box, strikers just love balls like that.

There were a few concerned faces in the crowd when Rory Patterson was substituted after an hour of the game but Marginson admitted it was purely precautionary. He added: We told Rory after he got his second goal that he had two minutes to score his third otherwise he was coming off and he was happy with that.

He knows we have to be careful with injuries and resting people at the right time. Everyone in the dressing room knows there are times when some of them arent going to be playing. Thats where I come in. I have to earn my corn now for picking players for the right game and right positions.

FC UNITED&apos;S big push for a third successive title hit the skids at a soggy Gigg Lane as keeper Sam Ashton gifted Lancaster an 89th minute equaliser.

The Rebels were on course their third win in a week when Ashton allowed an overhit pass to zip past him off the greasy surface, leaving Dave Foster to fire home from a narrow angle.

FC had earlier come from behind to lead 2-1 through Adam Carden and Jamie Baguley, but Foster&apos;s late leveller forced them to settle for a point
.
The 2-2 draw was a major missed opportunity for Karl Marginson&apos;s men as UniBond division one north leaders Skelmersdale, who they visit tomorrow, were also held, at Ossett.

Ground share deal announced for 2008/09 season

FC United are pleased to announce that a one-year deal has been reached with UniBond Premier Division side, Prescot Cables regarding a ground sharing arrangement for the 2008/09 season, subject to the decision being ratified by members.

The Board is fully aware that relocating to Merseyside may be a cause of concern for some supporters, however, it is confident that fans will understand the decision has had to be taken to secure the financial security of the club for the foreseeable future.

A club spokesperson said: Moving to Merseyside was by no means our ideal choice, however, we need a smaller, more affordable ground than Gigg Lane. We have been searching for a suitable option in and around the Manchester area for some time but nothing has come to fruition.

With time running out to secure a new deal, Prescot Cables approached us with a fantastic financial package to share Valerie Park. The offer was simply too good to refuse and we have decided that it is in the best interests of the club to go ahead with this deal for at least one year.

The spokesperson added: FC United are extremely grateful to Bury FC for the hospitality they have shown us over the last three years and we hope that supporters will give their backing to the club in what has been a difficult decision. We are sure that given time, fans will get used to life on Merseyside.

The Board will give a full presentation on why this decision has been taken to the membership and ask for votes in favour of it at the General Meeting on Sunday 13th April. Due to FA rules, members will also have the opportunity to hold a vote on whether to change the club name to FC United of Merseyside. andysimo123 April 1st, 2008, 01:27 PM That&apos;s not an April fool is it! :spam1: The best one I&apos;ve seen is that United are going to put 6 drums in the ground. 3 at each end in the middle.

FC United&apos;s hopes of clinching a third consecutive promotion remained firmly on track after a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Unibond First Division leaders Skelmersdale.

This result keeps United in the play-off places and also maintained their hopes of automatic promotion to the Premier Division.

They remain eight points behind Skem with four matches in hand.

The Rebels deserved a point after an excellent defensive display with centre backs Dave Chadwick and Rob Nugent in top form.

Goalkeeper Sam Ashton also had to be on full alert, holding on to a Steven Akrigg free-kick in the 17th minute and saving Chris Almond&apos;s shot before the interval but there were few chances after that.

A PUNISHING run of matches caught up with FC United on Thursday night as they squandered a half-time lead to lose 3-1 at Ossett Albion.

The Rebels broke the deadlock on 18 minutes when midfielder Simon Cardon poked the ball in from six yards out after Ossett had failed to clear a Chris Baguley corner but the hosts turned the match around with two goals from David Sears and one from Shaun Kelsey in the second half.

This was the Rebels&apos; sixth match in 12 days and Karl Marginson&apos;s side now have to face five league fixtures in ten days starting with a visit to Wakefield on Saturday.

The Rebels, however, remain in the play-off places and are still only eight points off leaders Skelmersdale with three games in hand.

United had the first chance on goal when on 15 minutes Stuart Rudd headed Liam Foster&apos;s superb right-wing cross just wide of the post, but Ossett quickly got back into the game.

They eventually pegged United back with an excellent curling shot from Sears on 51 minutes and secured all three points in stoppage time when Kelsey poked the ball past Sam Ashton in the United goal. TheGrand April 16th, 2008, 09:06 PM For the love of United

MORE than 100 poems are going on sale to try to help find a new home for a grassroots football team.

Blackley poet and author Mike Duff has put pen to paper to create &apos;Of A Mancunian&apos; - a celebration of forgotten Manchester people and characters from all walks of Mancunian life.

And all profits are going into a fund to finance a Manchester ground for FC United, the breakaway football team which has climbed two divisions since being formed three years ago and is currently fourth in the Unibond League First Division.

Mike - an FC United fan - was asked for the poems by Mark O&apos;Rourke, who is on the club&apos;s development team. The individual poems have been written over the past three or four years and most have not been published before.

Home games at the moment are played at Bury FC&apos;s Gigg Lane ground, where &apos;Of a Mancunian&apos; will be launched on 12 April, a day when the club is hoping for a bumper gate as under 16s can watch its game against Lancaster for free.

Mike, who has previously written stuff for The Reds&apos; United We Stand and FC United&apos;s magazine The Soul is One, said:&quot;I&apos;m sick of the attitude of professional football players, the way they treat the fans and the celebrity culture around them.

&quot;At FC United it is about making friends, not millionaires. It&apos;s bringing football back to the people.&quot;

The front cover of the book is taken at Harpurhey cemetery by the graveside of Nancy&quot;dickybird&quot;Cunningham, one of Manchester&apos;s forgotten characters. Nancy, who died in 1931, spent half her life drunk and was arrested 173 times for being drunk and disorderly.

Mike, 52, who lives on Victoria Avenue, said:&quot;It starts with a poem about Nancy and finishes with what I would like to happen to my ashes when I die. There&apos;s also one about a man who was killed on the first day of the Somme, so there&apos;s a bit on the history of Manchester too.&quot;

The books are being sold at Gigg Lane and Wigan Athletic for 5 and are also available through Mike&apos;s website www.mikeduff.co.uk

MIKE is to see his first book turned into a film.

Low Life received critical acclaim when it was released in 2000 and the publicity - including a favourable Guardian review - saw it translated into French and re-released as La Racaille de Rochdale Road.

Now a deal has been signed and sealed to bring Low Life to the small screen. London-based Ruby Films are in the process of making a short film based on Mike&apos;s day in the life of a thieving north Manchester scally.

Directing the work will be Adam Smith, who has directed some of the Skins programmes for Channel Four, as well as music videos for Chemical Brothers and The Streets.

Mike, of Victoria Avenue, Blackley, said:&quot;I was first contacted by Ruby Films two years ago but I&apos;m a bit of a cynic, so I thought &apos;I&apos;ll believe it when I see it.&apos;

&quot;The contracts were signed about two months ago and now the screenplay is being written. I&apos;m over the moon about it.&quot;

Mike&apos;s poem In the Rain, a celebration of Manchester&apos;s cultural diversity, won the 2004 Poem for Manchester competition and can be seen on the Manchester Curve bridge, linking Piccadilly Place to the mainline station. TheGrand April 16th, 2008, 09:07 PM Weary Rebels fire blanks

JADED FC United earned a hard-fought point at UniBond Division One North promotion-rivals Bradford Park Avenue in their fourth game in six days.

The Rebels had been dreaming of a third successive title, but a fixture backlog has left them desperately clinging on to the final play-off spot, one point above sixth-placed Ossett Albion having played a game less.

Karl Marginson&apos;s tired-looking side rarely threatened in a game of few chances, Chris Baguley going closest to breaking the deadlock with just five minutes remaining.

FC return to action on Wednesday night when they travel to Harrogate RA - their fifth away game in a row.

TWO goals from Stuart Rudd and one from Chris Baguley secured victory for FC United and galvanised their hopes of promotion to the Unibond Premier Division.

Rudd struck in five frantic second-half minutes, his second a wonderful lob from the edge of the box, before Baguley sealed the points.

This was United&apos;s first win since March 26 and sees them close the gap with First Division leaders Curzon Ashton to seven points with five games left.

Rebels&apos; boss Karl Marginson was pleased with the ruthlessness his side showed, especially after they had started sluggishly and deservedly found themselves a goal down on 25 minutes from a Ben Jones penalty following Shaun Roscoe&apos;s clumsy tackle.

The visitors got back into the match through a combination of determination and quick-passing and equalised on 46 minutes when Rudd turned his marker and rolled the ball past keeper Tom Morgan.

The imposing forward struck again soon after and as the hosts tired the Rebels went for the kill.

Top scorer Rory Patterson almost got the third when he hit the bar with a right-footed strike but Baguley made sure with a close-range shot.

FC United 5 Lancaster City 2

LANCASTER City crashed to a 5-2 defeat in front of a bumper crowd at FC United - but the final result didn&apos;t tell the full story of the UniBond League Division One North clash at Gigg Lane.

The Dolly Blues led against the league&apos;s big spenders and also rattled the woodwork on two occasions as they battled hard to get a shock win.

But in the end they ran out of steam as FC United took another big step towards the play-offs.

City led inside two minutes when Mark Jackson darted through a static United defence, who claimed for offside, and kept his cool to slot past Sam Ashton for a quality goal.

But Stuart Rudd levelled on 14 minutes as he beat Ben Price in a one-on-one situation.

Lancaster refused to be rattled by that blow despite a hostile crowd of almost 3,000 cranking up the volume and Aaron Helliwell created an opening for himself before firing past Ashton into the bottom corner.

The pressure was on at this stage and Price saved well from Rudd and then he stopped Simon Carden from putting United in front.

But the pressure told when Jerome Wright&apos;s corner hit Nugent and flew into the net before Rory Patterson&apos;s speculative volley deflect in off the unfortunate Price.

Jackson hit the post within seconds before Mike Rushton and Helliwell went close to getting City back into the game.

But Patterson made it 4-2 before Nugent headed a fifth to give the scoreline an unbalanced appearance.

RESURGENT FC United broke their Radcliffe Borough hoodoo thanks to strikes from Nick Robinson and Chris Baguley and an heroic performance from goalkeeper Sam Ashton.

It was the first time the Rebels have beaten Radcliffe in four attempts this season and keeps Karl Marginson&apos;s men firmly in the UniBond First Division North promotion picture.

The fact they did it with an inexperienced side made the result all the more impressive. FC will hope to repeat the victory when the sides meet again in tomorrow&apos;s President&apos;s Cup final.

Radcliffe started the game strongly but were rocked by two FC goals in quick succession.

First the lively Baguley sent Robinson clear and the striker finished smartly into the bottom corner after 14 minutes.

With Radcliffe reeling, Baguley lashed home a shot high into the net three minutes later to double the advantage.

Radcliffe had chances to haul themselves back into the game, with Steve Howson blazing over when it seemed easier to score. Griff Jones then saw his header rebound off the angle of post and bar before Ashton denied the same player with a superb reaction save from point blank range.

FC brought on Stuart Rudd at half time and the striker was quickly into the action, his low shot stopped by goalkeeper Phil Priestley. The game continued to swing from end to end, with the impressive Ashton getting down quickly to deny Neil Chappell moments later.

Rudd was through again as the game approached the hour mark, but seemed to lose his bearings and prodded the ball wide.

To their credit, Radcliffe continued to drive forward but they could not find a way past Ashton. FC now have three league games remaining and Marginson is confident his side can win them all.
Next, though, FC will turn their attention to the cup final and the chance of silverware. TheGrand April 16th, 2008, 09:11 PM http://fc-utd.co.uk/splash_pics/presfinal.jpg TheGrand April 17th, 2008, 12:17 PM It&apos;s pay on the gate, wear your Rosettes

STUART Rudd inspired FC United to victory in the President&apos;s Cup Final.

The striker made one and scored one in the final 10 minutes of the game to earn the Rebel Reds their first silverware of the season.

Karl Marginson&apos;s side had been reinstated to the competition after Nantwich were found guilty of fielding an ineligible player at the quarter final stage.

And they took full advantage with a powerful finish to what had been an even final, played at the Tameside Stadium, home of Curzon Ashton Football Club.

Rob Nugent had a first-minute header cleared off the line by Tony Whealing, but Boro gradually felt their way back into the game and could have taken the lead when Neil Chapple broke through, only to hit his shot straight at keeper Sam Ashton.

FC United made a strong start to the second half and top scorer Rory Patterson should have broken the deadlock when he fought off Craig Dawson only to skew his shot wide.

They got closer when Rudd sent a free header straight into the hands of Phil Priestley.

The breakthrough finally arrived with extra time looming large. Rudd produced a great cross from the right to allow substitute Chris Baguley to head home from close range.

Gary Sampson had a golden chance to equalise when his header from Lee Connell&apos;s cross was cleared off the line.

Rudd completed the job in the final minute when, with Boro caught up field chasing an equaliser, he produced a neat finish to seal the victory.

FC United return to UniBond League Division One North action tomorrow as they look to keep alive their slim title hopes.

The Gigg Lane tenants travel to Newcastle Blue Star trailing leaders Bradford Park Avenue by four points, having played a game more.

Peter Evans

Disillusioned football supporters are creating their own lower league teams to bring fun and loyalty back to the people&apos;s game. The message is loud and clear to the money men - keep your grubby hands off our game.

&apos;Fans dont want to be told where and with whom they can stand&apos;

Ill be wanting United to win but ours is a real football club, a real football team. FC Uniteds general manager Andy Walsh.

AFC Wimbledon, FC United and now AFC Liverpool. Real football teams. Grass-roots clubs being reborn at the lowest level by real supporters disillusioned with how their football experience has degenerated.

They wanted and needed something else. They were fed up with 11.30 am kick-offs, vastly-inflated season-ticket prices and people in charge of their clubs who didnt have their best interests at heart. They longed for the Exeter City fan experience.

This statement may seem bizarre. To be honest a great deal of the time even Exeter City fans may well wish they werent supporters of the Grecians. But Im about to explain that when you look closer, away from results on the pitch, its the Exeter City fan experience that these dejected fans are searching for.

Sixth in the Blue Square Premier in our fifth season outside the Football League, we were losing play-off finalists at Wembley last May and this season has been hit-and-miss with the club currently outside the play-off places on goal difference. But its not the performances on the pitch, the trip to the New Wembley or the personnel on board that has these Manchester United and Liverpool fans wishing they were worshipping at Exeters Cathedral of Football - St James Park.

Forget the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. In the cases of FC Uniteds it was the issue of ownership that proved to be the straw that broke the commitment, trust and loyalty of the fans. The final straw for these thousands of disillusioned supporters was watching the Glazer family slither into Old Trafford. The fans wanted a club where they could have their say.

These real football clubs&apos; main objective is to be at one with their fans, the very same fans that many of the big clubs were taking for granted.

The AFC Liverpool site describes how it purports to create a club owned by Liverpool fans and run by Liverpool fans one which will restore the link between club and supporters. FC Uniteds manifesto talks of a similar need to have a member-owned democracy. In this way AFC Liverpools organisers could do themselves a lot of favours by having a closer look at Exeter City. After years of mismanagement and financial disasters the club was days from going out of business until a series of events led to Exeter City Supporters Trust taking control in 2003, our club for the fans owned by us, the fans.

The trust is one of 15 in England with 2,271 members including myself and has raised over 700,000 for the club since its creation. A democratic, non-profit organisation with a constitution very similar to those created at the breakaway clubs AFC Wimbledon and FC United. Each member has equal ownership of the club with the ability to vote on any major decisions made. Currently the issues that Supporters Trust members can cast their vote on vary from selecting next seasons home shirt to whether the clubs long term future is at St James Park or a new home. In terms of ownership Exeter City Football Club provides the stability and the union between the supporters and the club that many supporters fear they will see disappear over the sunset as the new owners arrive in town.

Its not just the ownership issue that could cause jealous glances towards the capital of Devon. There is also the subject of atmosphere, an issue at Manchester United long before Roy Keanes prawn sandwich rant. The thorny discussion surrounding the deterioration of atmosphere at Premiers League games has been credited to the demolition of the terraces in the top flight and the pricing of real fans out the game. Well at Exeter City an adult ticket to stand, sing and shiver on the terraces for 23 home games would set you back 235. Problem well and truly solved.

Fans dont want to be told where and with whom they can stand. We want to be given the chance to mix with their fellow supporters, and celebrate with them.

AFC Liverpool will continue their plans to get their supporter-run, grassroots club ready to compete in the North West Counties League Division Two for next season. Their aim to attract fans that can have the enjoyment of an afternoons football for their family at a club that is affordable and fun, at a club where they are a real part of the community.

This is a place where they can stand and sing and can partake in the ecstatic celebrations of fans and watch their club rise through the leagues without fearing the next chairman who is only got money on his mind.

As an Exeter City fan I am proud that my club already offers all these elements that these disenchanted fans are searching for, a real football club, a real football team.

21/ 4/2008

FOOTBALLER Bradley Howard has proved himself a model player in more ways than one.

The FC United defender, who has a day job as a model, intervened when an angry customer hit out at an assistant in a Manchester branch of McDonalds.

Bradley and four of his team-mates were in the fast food restaurant at Urmston near the M60 waiting for the team coach to take them to a game against Newcastle Blue Star.

A furious customer who had been arguing with an assistant suddenly leapt behind the counter and attacked the worker.

Bradley, 21, and team-mate Rob Howarth also jumped the counter and dragged the burly customer away.

Still furious because he had to wait up to 10 minutes for his food, the customer continued remonstrating but when he saw the group of footballers he ran out and sped off in his car.

Bradley - who got a modelling contract with agency Nemesis after winning a radio competition - said:&quot;It took two of us to throw him off the assistant because he was so big.

&quot;He was so angry that he had to wait 10 minutes for his food. There was no need for him to start bullying and hitting the assistant who he said had ignored him.&quot;

Rob said:&quot;He was swearing all the time and then suddenly got behind the tills and hit the assistant. Brad and I leapt over the counter and basically restrained him.&quot;

The players, whose team went on to win 4-0 against Newcastle Blue Star to move within two points of the top of the Unibond North League, got a predictable reward from the grateful staff ( free chicken burgers).

FC United manager Karl Marginson said:&quot;Obviously these lads can look after themselves on the football field and acted promptly when they saw the assistant being bullied.

&quot;I am sure they enjoyed their chicken burgers although normally of course they would choose the healthy option.&quot;

Staff contacted police but by then the team coach had arrived and the attacker had fled. TheGrand April 21st, 2008, 05:57 PM From The MEN

FC UNITED&apos;S title dreams were left in tatters last night after a shock draw with Unibond First Division North strugglers Woodley Sports at Gigg Lane.

The Rebels went into the clash with the Stockport side five points behind leaders Bradford Park Avenue knowing three points from their game in hand would take the race to Saturday&apos;s final day.

But a speculative 68th minute lob from way out on the left wing by Jamie Kay left FC United contemplating next Tuesday&apos;s play-off semi final tie.

Striker Jerome Wright grabbed a fine last-minute equaliser, but it just was not enough.

The point gives Woodley some much-needed breathing space in their battle, with Bridlington Town, to avoid relegation.

Woodley could have gone in front eight minutes before the break when striker Andy Farrell saw a close- range volley bravely blocked by home skipper Dave Chadwick.

They were forced onto the back foot again early in the second period, as FC United increased their intensity, but weathered the storm. TheGrand April 28th, 2008, 10:56 AM FC play-off hope

FC United are banking on a victory over Garforth guaranteeing them a home tie in the play-offs.

The rebel reds were denied automatic promotion when they were held by Woodley Sports on Wednesday night, but Karl Marginson insists his side still have plenty to play for in tomorrow&apos;s final league game of the season.

&quot;We want to finish second,&quot;said the United boss.&quot;We probably knew for a few weeks that realistically we were not going to get automatic promotion.

&quot;The lads did put themselves back in a great position, but it wasn&apos;t to be. Well done to Bradford. We want to beat Garforth tomorrow to make sure we are at home in the play-offs. Then, with our magnificent support, we have no reason to fear anyone.&quot;

Should Marginson&apos;s men finish second, they will host either Bamber Bridge or Ossett Albion in the play-off semi-final at Gigg Lane on Tuesday night.

TRIBUTES have been paid to one of the founders of FC United who died following an accident after he had gone to watch an away match.

Fred Garner, 29, from Chorlton, was discovered with a serious head injury at the foot of a fire escape outside the Rex Hotel, in Whitley Bay.

He was a founding member of FC United, the football club set up by breakaway fans following Malcolm Glazer&apos;s takeover of Manchester United.

Fred had gone to the north east to see FC United&apos;s 4-0 win against Newcastle Blue Star on April 19 and was found collapsed at 5am the following morning.

He underwent major surgery at Newcastle General Hospital, but died on Monday evening. It is thought he may have fallen on the fire escape.

Today his father Kevin Garner paid tribute to a son who `loved his football&apos; and was `loved by everyone he knew&apos;.

Mr Garner, 53, had travelled with Fred to watch FC United&apos;s match against Blue Star and was staying with him at the same hotel.

He said:&quot;We went everywhere together, watching Manchester United and then watching FC United.

&quot;The last time I hugged him was after the Newcastle Blue Star match, as we were watching Manchester United on TV in the bar. It was a moment I will never forget.&quot;

Tributes to Fred, who worked with his dad in the gas industry, have also been paid on FC United and Manchester United fans&apos; forums.

A minute&apos;s silence was held by more than 1,500 fans before FC United&apos;s midweek match against Woodley Sports.

Mr Garner added:&quot;He just loved everything about FC United. The minute&apos;s silence that was held for him was fantastic. It was observed impeccably. Fred had lots of friends and he was loved by everyone.&quot;

FC United, who play their home matches at Bury&apos;s Gigg Lane stadium, are chasing promotion in the UniBond First Division North. They were playing their last league fixture of the season today. (SAT)

Reds must overcome bogey-side Bamber Bridge

FC United must overcome their Bamber Bridge hoodoo in the play-off semi-final this Wednesday if they are to stand any chance of achieving a third consecutive promotion in what is arguable the clubs biggest ever game in its three year history.

After securing second place in the league, United will be confident mood and feel that they have already proved that they deserve to be promoted alongside champions Bradford Park Avenue into the UniBond Premier Division.

However, the play-off system creates a fresh fight for promotion where second place counts only for gaining home advantage. Despite Bamber Bridge finishing in fifth place, they along with Bradford, are the only team that the Reds failed to beat in the league this season.

United did win the first fixture between the two sides in the Presidents Cup on Halloween 5-0 but Brig fielded a largely second string team on that evening. The next meeting was at Irongate three weeks later and the Preston outfit comfortably won 3-0 that day.

United fans can equally mention the fact that David Chadwick, Staurt Rudd, Josh Howard and Simon Carden were missing on that occasion. When those players were available for the two clashes in February and March, the Reds held Brig to a nil-nil and 2-2 draw. However, both were close encounters which could have gone either way, the latter affair needing Chris Baguley to safe United with a spectacular injury time strike.

The more positive news is that current form suggests that United have the edge. The Reds have won four out of their last five with the disappointing draw against Woodley Sports as the only blotched on that record.

In comparison, Brig have won just two of their last five games with two draws and one defeat. Their last victory was in emphatic style though when they crushed promotion rivals Ossett Albion 5-0 at Queens Terrace, taking a massive step towards securing a play-off place. So, it would appear that Brig can rise to the occasion when necessary.

Unlike another UniBond Division One North side, the Bamber Boys have certainly not tried to earn a reputation as Samba Boys. In the three league meetings with the Reds this year, they have tackled hard and used physical strength to stop United from playing their own game. They also have a striker who has no problems finding the back of the net in Ryan Salmon, who was the divisions fourth top-scorer with a haul of 28 goals in all competitions.

United on the other hand, have top scorer Rory Patterson who notched 39 goals this season and proven goal scorer Stuart Rudd who looks to be right back to his best. The major concern will be whether captain, David Chadwick will be past fit in time for the all important clash.

As someone once said; its squeaky bum time. Get yourselves to that football ground, get behind the lads and cheer them on, hopefully, to the play-off final on Saturday. TheGrand May 1st, 2008, 10:40 AM http://fcumfiles.co.uk/splash_pics/skfin.jpg

United through to play-off final

FC United set up a play-off final clash with Skelmersdale United on Saturday by overcoming their Bamber Bridge hoodoo 3-2 in a tense semi-final at Gigg Lane on Wednesday night.

United had enough to see off the dangerous visitors with goals from Adam Carden, Rory Patterson and Jerome Wright, and were cheered on all the way by one of the nosiest crowds of the season.

The opening exchanges between the two were a little nervous and both could have been forgiven for being cagey in a game with so much on the line.

Brig had the first opportunity to take the lead but striker Ryan Salmons shot deflected off Adam Turner and hit the United bar.

But it was the home team who took the lead after Adam Carden; who had an exceptional game, broke on the right beating a couple of defenders before firing past Bridge keeper Terry McCormick to put the home team in front.

The goal picked up an already energised crowd and United kicked on looking for the second, which came when Carden again broke on the right and found himself one-on-one with McCormick for a second time but squared to Patterson who slotted home for his 40th, and possibly simplest, goal of the season.

United held a two goal lead going into the break, but were not home and dry as the visitors always looked dangerous coming forward and an early goal in the second half would see the game take on a whole new complexion.

The dreaded goal did indeed come early in the second half when a free kick from deep on the left was headed back across the box for Neil Zarac to head past Sam Ashton to bring Brig back into the game.

The goal didnt make United retreat, in fact it spurred them on a little and they began to pressurise the visitors with good possession play and dangerous balls into the box.

The two goal advantage was restored via the pressure United were applying a ball from the right was sent into the box and never dealt with properly by the Brig defence. Jerome Wright picked the ball up on the left hand side of the box, shifted the ball onto his left foot and put the ball away to trigger all kinds of celebrations from the United faithful.

But anyone who thought United were home and dry were given something to think about for the last ten minutes when substitute Allan Fleming score the fifth goal of the evening with a well placed volley into the United net.

But other than a few nervous balls into the box late on United had enough to see off their opponents and see themselves into Saturdays final with Skelmersdale.

If the atmosphere by tonights game was anything to go by then Saturdays game will be something special and could go down as the biggest game in Uniteds history as they look for their third successive promotion in the clubs three year existence.

FC United manager Karl Marginson has set his sights on what would be an amazing four successive promotion.

The Rebels safely confirmed their passage to the Unibond Premier Division with a pulsating victory over Skelmersdale in the Division One North play-off final at Gigg Lane on Saturday.

And with it came their third promotion in three years of existence. Two penalties from Nicky Platt and Rory Chadwick were complimented with strikes from captain marvel Dave Chadwick and sub Chris Baguley.

The visitors had gone ahead in front of a bumper crowd of 3,258 thanks to Sean McConville&apos;s stunning tenth minute free-kick.

But Skem finished the game with nine men after referee Billy Khatib dismissed skipper Michael White and Kevin Leadbetter.

Marginson said:&quot;We&apos;ve had three fantastic seasons - this promotion is the best of the lot.

&quot;Four promotions has got to be the aim. We will be setting our stall out to go as far as we can. We will start off with the first game, try and win that, and then see where it takes us.

&quot;I know they are all clichs, but there is nothing more true. You have got to take each game as it comes. We have got to judge each game on its own merit, and try and win football matches. That has been our philosophy in three years - it&apos;s not been a bad one.&quot;

After going behind early on, the Reds drew level six minutes before the break when White saw red for handling Jerome Wright&apos;s goalbound header. Platt clinically converted from the spot.

Defender Chadwick, who had been a doubt with a hamstring strain, gave the hosts the lead when he nodded home a long free-kick on 51 minutes.

Any hopes of a Skem recovery were completely banished just after the hour. Michael Duffy was harshly penalised for deliberately handling in the box.

Platt smashed the ball against the bar, only to see it balloon to the edge of the box where another penalty was awarded for minimal contact in a scramble.

Star striker Rory Patterson converted but only after the ball had spun into the net off the hand of keeper Rory McMahon.

Skem sub Leadbetter was dismissed for referee abuse, while sub Chris Baguley added a fourth with a low 20-yard drive ten minutes from time. TheGrand May 6th, 2008, 02:06 PM FA Cup&amp;FA Trophy Venue 2008-09

First there was AFC Wimbledon, formed by fans turning away from the&quot;franchising&quot;of their club to Milton Keynes in 2002, then FC United of Manchester, established three years later by supporters opposed to the Glazer family&apos;s Old Trafford takeover. From next season, another grassroots offshoot of a big club will embark on a non-League football adventure: AFC Liverpool.

Begun just nine weeks ago as an idea floated on the internet by lifelong Liverpool fan Alun Parry, AFC Liverpool has formed as a supporter-owned club with 500 members and rising, recruited an experienced non-League manager, Derek Goulding, and held trials on Monday to which 300 hopeful players turned up, eager to be part of the inaugural season.

Parry, 37, a musician and Kop season ticket holder, stresses that the club is not a protest or reaction to the more painful aspects of Tom Hicks and George Gillett&apos;s ownership of Liverpool. His key motivation is to form a club which less well-off and younger supporters can afford to watch.

&quot;Many people have been priced out at Anfield,&quot;Parry explained.&quot;I do not blame the club, their prices are low compared to other Premier League clubs. They are just too much for a lot of us.&quot;

Full ticket prices at Anfield this season were 34 and 32 for category B games; 34 and 36 for category A; season tickets ranged from 650 in the main stand to 600 in the Kop. The demand is there, with a long waiting list for season tickets, but Parry points to an ageing of the Liverpool crowd, as at Premier League grounds generally.

&quot;It came home to me when my brother, John, who can&apos;t afford to go, took his son to Anfield just to show him the atmosphere outside a game - he couldn&apos;t afford to take them both in. My dad took me on to the Kop as a boy and the ground was teeming with kids. In 1985 a Kop season ticket was 45, now it&apos;s 600. Young people can&apos;t afford it.&quot;

AFC Liverpool ticket prices have been set at 5 for adults and a maximum of 2 for children, and Parry is hoping for crowds of between 1,500 and 2,000.

Goulding, formerly manager of the Blue Square North club Burscough, is enthusiastic:&quot;The club&apos;s founding values are spot on,&quot;he said.&quot;A lot of Liverpool people are missing out on the football experience which used to be for everyone.&quot;

Last Saturday AFC Wimbledon and FC United of Manchester won promotion via their play-offs, to Blue Square South and the Unibond Premier League respectively. AFC Liverpool will be starting next season where FCUM began in 2005, in the Vodkat North West Counties League, Division Two.

A promotion......... Isaac Newell May 8th, 2008, 01:47 PM Will they need some strengthening next season ? TheGrand May 8th, 2008, 02:34 PM Will they need some strengthening next season ?

The playing budget is tight and will remain so, contrary to popular belief, we have not bought the league, infact quite a few clubs in Division One have spent far more on their squads then we have.

From a personal perspective, Id like to see the first team remain where they are now, so that the clubs infrastructure can catch up (no ground no Conference). I think we can be comfortable with the present team in the Premier Division but to be fair Im no expert.

Trust in Margy :cheers: Chogmook May 8th, 2008, 02:41 PM So what tier have they been promoted to? (Premier League being the 1st Tier of course)
