 * supporting human health, animal rights, and ecology * 

 President&apos;s Message: Magic Bullets and Instant Everything 

 It all started with the Industrial Revolution and culminated with the highest rates of heart disease, cancer and obesity this planet has ever seen. Once we were able to domesticate and automate the processing of animals for food, once we developed a transportation infrastructure to ship these perishables to anyone who had the money to pay for them, once the mass media spread the glamour and phony appeal to promote whatever product had the highest profit margin-once all this was in place, anything could be sold to anybody. Big bucks were made, and still are, at stake. 
 

 
 Once people were exposed to items such as TV dinners and instant coffee, to slabs of animal flesh on plates that were somehow made to look very appealing, the rush was on to get any food item at my time of year. Once tastes were developed for these rich foods, the ready availability satisfied the tastes of all those who could afford them. Those who could not were given food stamps so that they, too, could partake of the &apos;new cuisine. 

 It was years before anyone made the connection between the rising rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and even many behavioral changes. Unfortunately, most people still haven&apos;t made the connection. So to &apos;fix&quot;the health problems that have developed, they seek out the purveyors of&quot;magic bullets&quot;such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, estrogen blockers, prostate shrinkers, hypoglycemics, diet pills, calcium supplements, and faster elevators, more escalators, more cars and, therefore, more parking lots, automatic toothbrushes, the&quot;just-add-water&quot;instant meats, 

 It&apos;s no wonder that we, as a nation, are getting fatter and sicker. How much longer will it take for people to see the causal relationship?

 Restaurant Review 

 FAST FOOD FOR HUNGRY VEGGIES 
 

 
 This time, two slightly out of the way eateries are in our spotlight because they offer us something a little different, ono, and cheap. Can&apos;t beat that combination! First on our pursuit of healthy fare is The Big Burrito, a bright and simple spot in the Mapunapuna area. Near Puuloa and Salt Lake Blvd. at 2875 Pa&apos;a St. in an industrial area you&apos;ll find this bright and simple spot with its claim to Vegetarian Fame; it&apos;s the Vegetarian Low fat-Heart Healthy huge burrito. A monster size spinach tortilla is stuffed to the gills with steamed vegetables, Spanish rice. whole black beans, shredded cabbage, green onions, spicy tomato~corn salsa (or mild salsa). For 54.50, it&apos;s a bargain. You can get extra veggie food as side orders. The staff are friendly and are happy to set up your burrito your way. You can choose your tortilla from a selection of spinach, whole wheat, chili pepper, white flour (but you wouldn&apos;t want this one). Boy, those green spinach and red pepper tortillas did look strange but pretty. I&apos;ll try the red pepper kind next time. By the time you read this, a new Big Burrito will be open in Kailua across the street from Liberty House in a strip shopping mall at S72 Kailua Rd. Another one is scheduled for Kahala Mall next to the California Pizza kitchen. Our next find is the Pastele Shop at 2101 N. School St. corner of Gulick. Their Vegetarian pastele looks like a tamale. The base that would be corn mesa in a tamale is made from boiled green bananas. Topped with veggies, it&apos;s wrapped in a ti leaf and steamed to perfection. Add some rice and vegetarian beans. This is something really different, and good. Give it a try. Happy eating!

 SCHOOL LUNCH LIAISON ANNOUNCEMENT 

 IF- you believe the ideal diet for children (and adults) consists of whole grains, colorful fresh plant foods, is devoid of meat, dairy products and excessive fat, 

 IF-you have a passion for the welfare of our innocent future citizens, and care what they&apos;re fed at school (and home) and taught about nutrition, 

 IF-you believe in accomplishing positive change through the use of peaceful diplomacy, mutual respect and the sharing of information, 

 HERE&apos;S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATE in supporting innovations in the schools which will eventually have major impact on every one of us, and the fate of our precious home, Earth.. Review your priorities and see if you might want to create a little time in your busy schedule to join us in this important work on the SCHOOL LUNCH LIAISON COMMITTEE. 

 It especially would be of great help to have those of you with school age children or who work in some setting where you can affect decisions about them. We also need a computer or access to one. 

 We are fortunate the seeds have already been planted. Eliot Rosen introduced a bill several years ago in the State Senate for a second choice vegetarian lunch option in the public schools. The bill was approved but not funded. Many of us testified and/or had dialogue at that time with Eugene Kaneshiro, State Department of Education School Food Services Director, and other D.O.E. Personnel seeking avenues for such a change. 

 Dr. William Harris has been carrying the ball since, maintaining an open channel of mutual respect and shared information with Mr. .Kaneshiro. This is in addition to being editor of this newsletter, Kaiser emergency physician, creator of the&quot;veg&quot;series on cable T.V., author, etc. 

 Because of all the prior work of Dr. Harris, V.S.H. founders and Board members, past and present, and pioneers in the medical community-- 

 Because of me courage of a very positive and committed food service manager, the blessings of Mr. Kaneshiro, a committee of dedicated parents, students, and staff and much printed material from mainland successes- I have had good fortune facilitating the creation of a pilot vegetarian lunch option in an Oahu public elementary school. The once-a-week plant-based option starts March 1, 19%, which, as it turns out, is National Pig Day!!l 

 1 also feel excited about being asked by the Board to be the V.S.H. School Lunch Liaison. It&apos;s&quot;chicken-skin&quot;stuff accomplishing our dreams but also lots of work. The initiatives started at this pilot school will be shared with Mr. Kaneshiro for use at the state level. 

 Because he shares our vision for a healthy choice option in all statewide schools, and because of improvements taking place nationally in how school menus are planned, Mr. Kaneshiro welcomes an organized, informed, and mutually respectful liaison with the V.S.H., an exchange of information and mutual brainstorming.. 

 We are fortunate to have a large network of very expert consultants. What we need now are active participants in this exciting labor of love. 

 If you are interested, please call me: Cheryl Chung 235-5132. 
 
 The Central Oahu Branch of VSH 

 Our first monthly meeting on Jan. 15 was a hit. The Central Oahu Branch (Mililani) of the Vegetarian Society of Honolulu had a VERY successful first meeting! A minimum of 160 people attended-perhaps up to 170! 

 Dr. Terry Shintani attracted a huge crowd, one not normally in attendance at the Downtown VSH meetings. Some of the Downtown regulars showed up--however. many people showing up in Mililani were people who did not normally attend our Downtown VSH meetings. 

 (The typical reasons being difficulty of driving to our regular meetings from Central Oahu as well as difficulty finding our Ala Wai meeting site.) The sheer number of people in attendance as well as the enthusiasm was incredible! Now what the Central Oahu Branch needs is more volunteers. With the aid of survey of attendees, they may find the help needed to capitalize on this very successful initial meeting! 

 Thanks to all of you who came, We hope you will return and join us in other events. Please feel free to bring your friends to any meetings and events. We have an exciting upcoming schedule and look forward to a full parking lot each month. Keep a lookout for ideas for outings and share them at our monthly meetings. Also, if you have suggested topics, speakers or interests, please make them known. Remember - this is your organization.

 Meet the Members &quot;Before you eat anything, think of where it comes from,&quot;says Patrick Moore. He&apos;s been aware of vegetarianism about 14 years since the days when John McDougall, M.D. was broadcasting a weekly show on KGU.&quot;I called him up and asked the big question. I was eating rice and salad and broccoli and wondering where I&apos;d ever get enough protein.&quot;John took the next twenty minutes to explain that rice and broccoli and salad have plenty of protein, thank you very much, and that whole-food vegans never need worry about protein deficiency. Pat made the big switch but there were backsliding times too, until VSH started up in 1990. Pat was one of the first members and since then he&apos;s stayed on the vegan path. 
 He&apos;s also been a big help to VSH, starting with a stint working in the very rustic VSH office before computers came in, and progressing through testimony at the state legislature for the vegan school lunch option in 1991, and helping to distribute petitions against the infamous1994 SB 2010 which appropriated $500.000 in taxpayers&apos; funds to build a slaughterhouse on Molokai. Presently Pat, who worked in the DOE&apos;s TV studio for two years, is assisting in the VSH project to videotape all of our monthly speakers and play the lectures on Olelo. 

 Pat grew up in West Virginia, the Midwest, and California, moving out here in 1967 to surf. But after twenty years he gave it up because of the crowds and because&quot;the kids think getting every wave is like life or death.&quot;Since then he&apos;s been into long distance running with&quot;less than 20 triathlons&quot;(including one second place) under his belt. There are times when the surf still looks inviting though, and he can see the waves from his construction site on Waialae Iki. 

 &quot;When I was a little kid in West Virginia. I had to help my mother slaughter the chickens. I&apos;d hold them and she&apos;d cut off their heads. Then they&apos;d run around with their heads off. My poor mother finally had her gallbladder out after eating all that cholesterol.&quot;Mom and Dad are still living end eating about the same as before but Pat&apos;s approach to chickens has changed radically: he now has three of them as pets. 

 &quot;Chickens are really smart,&quot;says Pat.&quot;They&apos;ve got this brain about the size of a pea but they get more bang for the buck than most people. They&apos;re tame and they love to be petted. They&apos;ve got a routine. Up in the morning, cross the street, and then they eat all the bugs in the neighbors&apos; yards.&quot;Home to bed at night; they have to fly up on their unclipped wings about five feet to get into their cage which is out of range for marauding dogs. It&apos;s a pretty good life for chickens compared to the millions on the mainland crammed into battery cages. 

 &quot;I like to see people get their just rewards,&quot;says Pat,&quot;but how can they survive on the blood of all those dead animals? You reap what you sow, and I think there really is karma.&quot; 

 -Bill Harris, M.D. 


 
 Vegan in Viet Nam 

 Thirty years after serving in a country tom by war, I planned a return trip to Viet Nam. Hepatitis B vaccination done, diarrhea and dysentery medicines packed, Beano, in hand (it&apos;s a long flight), I thought I was well prepared. 

 After two years learning to perfect a low-fat Vegan lifestyle in Hawaii, I was going to a country where folks would be happy to have a bit more fat or meat in their diet if thy could afford it. Would I be able to maintain my 10% fat, vegetarian diet while traveling? 

 Happily, it was not only easy, but it was an exciting adventure. Flying on China Airlines, I was given a choice of nine different vegetarian meal options. I chose a&quot;strict vegetarian&quot;and was pleasantly surprised with delicious low-fat vegan meals. A small container of margarine was included on the tray, but the salad dressing was balsamic vinegar instead of the usual oil dressing. 

 Arriving in Saigon, I stayed with a friend&apos;s family. While none in home were vegetarian, they served all the dishes without meat, egg or dairy to me. Their meals were mainly green and root vegetables with a small amount of meat used flavoring. 

 Finding vegetarian restaurants is not difficult; the easiest way to find is to ask at a Buddhist temple. Often them is one nearby or operated by temple members. To tell someone you&apos;re vegetarian just say&quot;toi anh chay.&quot;(Toy aahn chai). 

 In Hue, the ancient imperial capitol, we found the vegetarian bargain of the century. Ten courses of vegetables, mushrooms of every variety, braised, marinated tofu, seitan (gluten) dishes that looked and tasted like sausage, ham and Peking duck, herbal tea, and fruit all for less than two US dollars. 

 Taking a day-long hip down the Perfume River to the Emperors&apos; tombs, simply asking for vegetarian, got us a variety of scrumptious dishes prepared on the boat. Asking for it to be prepared without oil got a few curious glances, but the results were as close to fat free as possible. 

 Because Buddhism is highly respected and the monks are strict vegetarians, requesting vegetarian meals is met with admiration and approval almost everywhere. 

 In Hanoi the choices were less varied, but one Buddhist temple is happy to serve their usual vegetarian meal to foreigners. They don&apos;t charge for them, but will accept donations. Ha Long Bay, a five hour drive from Hanoi, is one of the most beautiful vistas on earth. 3,000 rock islands jut up from the misty bay, reminding one of ancient Chinese landscape scrolls. A two day tour from Hanoi, including hotel, four delicious vegan meals, ten hours of mini-bus transportation and eight hours of boat sightseeing, cost $23. 

 After over two weeks on Viet Nam, I stayed four days in Taipei. While much more expensive, Taiwan&apos;s capital offers a wide choice of vegetarian restaurants with most of the selections vegan. At one point, in a place where no vegetarian restaurants were indicated, I asked at a Buddhist temple and was taken to a nearby newly opened delight. 

 All the food was beautifully laid out and one takes as much as one wants of each dish. The plate is weighed to determine the price. A huge plate, packed with an amazing variety of fat-free vegan delights plus unlimited brown or white rice cost me NT$104 (US $3.82). 

 All this without a single tummy-ache diarrhea, or discomfort. Travel vegan and low-fat and enjoy it all.

 Animal Rights Hawaii 

 Punahou, Mililani, and Kamehameha schools now have active Animal Rights groups formed. 

 ARH was instrumental in stopping a slaughter of semi-tame pig at Schofield Barracks and is presently trying to head off the destruction of wild goats on Kauai and 600 axis deer at Kalaupapa (Molokai). The Humane Society of the United States lent a hand by sending National Parks personnel updated literature on immuno-sterilization. Immuno-contraception and sterilization will almost certainly be the solution to most animal over-population problems and, unlike current lethal animal control measures, harmless and effective. 

 1/26/96-The USDA has recently approved a pilot project for chemically de-hairing cattle prior to slaughter. Tbs ostensible reason is to get rid of hair, mud and manure to prevent bacterial contamination of&quot;food&quot;. There are no failsafe methods to guarantee that no conscious animal is moved into the spray and that no animal regains consciousness at any time during this procedure which will be tested in Colorado by Monfort Inc., the slaughtering division of ConAgra. Please contact Philip B. Fletcher, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer ConAgra, Inc. One ConAgra Dr. Omaha, NE 68102-5001, phone: 402-595-4000 FAX: 402- 595-4714. 

 ARH and HSUS, the Humane Society of the U.S., campaigned again against continued subsidies for the mink industry (~$2 million/year) and were pleased when the subsidies were voted down by an amendment to H.R. 1976, the Agricultural Appropriations Bill. Senators lnouye and Akaka voted for the amendment and the rest of congress agreed. Since 1989 the federal government has given ~$13 million to the Mink Export Development Council for fashion shows, advertising and export promotions. The number of mink farms in the U.S. has declined from 940 in 1989 to 457 in 1994 and in the words of one Wisconsin mink rancher:&quot;the mink industry is pretty much dead in the U.S.&quot; 

 Elephant Attack Cases, zoos and circuses 1985-1995: Fatalities 23, Injuries 56. (extracted from data in Animals Agenda Vol 15, no.4 1995). In spite of these figures the Honolulu City Council fails to move in favor of the&quot;Tyke&quot;Bill proposed by Councilman John Henry Felix (547-7003) which would ban exotic performing animals on C+C premises. Barnum and Bailey sent out a rep on 1/31/96 to throw cold water on the bill and apparently his testimony carried the day. OK, folks, let&apos;s just wait until another Tyke shows up and this time kills a few spectators at the Blaisdell Center. In 1971 a lady parked her baby under a palm tree in Kapiolani Park and (guess what?) a coconut fell and killed it. She sued C+C and collected a million bucks. In 1973 a Chicago man collected another $2 million after he let his non-swimming sons go into the ocean and (guess what?) they drowned. In 1993 a family collected $3 million dollars from C+C after their son dove into shallow water at Makaha and (guess what?) went quadriplegic. Let&apos;s see how long it takes for plaintiffs lawyers to find the&quot;deep pocket&quot;when C+C is really and actually at fault for allowing another elephant attack on government property! Council members still voting against the bill: Bainum 247-7004 and Mansho 547-7001. We would appreciate letters, faxes and calls to the Council in support of Bill 3, the Tyke Bill. The Honolulu City Council tel# is: 808-547-7000 FAX: 808-523-4220 address: 530 S. King St. Honolulu, Hawai&apos;i 96813. Mahalo nui loa! 

 The number of animals used in scientific research has dropped by about half since 1968, says Andrew Rowan, a scientist at the Center for Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University.

 From the Internet 

 The Net is a hotbed of vegetarian, vegan, and animal rights activists making an end run around the commercial media&apos;s brownout an these revolutionary subjects.
