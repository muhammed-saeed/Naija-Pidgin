KFC wants you to help end breast cancer by buying a bucket of obesity- and heart attack-inducing food

 To be fair, the simple act of eating something the Colonel&apos;s crew dipped and fried or even a whole bucket of it will not instantaneously turn you obese or cause you to fall to the ground from sudden cardiac arrest. However, I do believe it is quite fair to say that food like the kind sold at the counters and drive-thrus of KFCs across this great land of ever-expanding waistbands does contribute to the health crises we&apos;re facing as a country.

For some strange reason, KFC has a new cause-related marketing campaign centered on another health issue -- breast cancer. The same people who have recently made available a sandwich that replaces bread with fried chicken (and to be fair, grilled chicken in lieu of bread is an option) are now bringing you Buckets for the Cure , an opportunity to contribute to finding a cure for breast cancer by buying a big old bucket of their fried chicken.

I will pause here to say that I strongly support both the cause and the organization benefiting from the pink KFC buckets, Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Of course we should be donating our time and funds to breast cancer research and treatments. We absolutely do need increased awareness about how to take good care of our bodies and our breasts and what nonprofits like this one are doing to get us closer to the cure.

But should we really be doing it by buying fast food? If you are one of the people who feels compelled to purchase one of these pink buckets and bring it home for a family dinner and perhaps you (or you and one other person at the table) even enjoy a wing, a breast, and a drumstick , do you know that you will be consuming 580 calories, 30 grams of fat, and 1,440 milligrams of sodium for Original Recipe or 850 calories, 56 grams of fat, and 1,780 milligrams of sodium for Extra Crispy (the grilled chicken rings up at 202 calories and 14 grams of fat but still packs a big sodium punch with 1,030 milligrams for the combo)? Is it worth gutting all that out to contribute 50-cents to a breast cancer cause?

I applaud KFC&apos;s intent to make what they say will be &quot;the largest single donation to end breast cancer forever,&quot; a goal of $8.5 million. I do think they should be handing over some of their profits to health causes, including this one. However, I really disagree with selling fried chicken to do it. I just don&apos;t think we should be sacrificing our nutrition to participate.

Instead of ordering up one of those pink buckets tonight, why not just click over to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and make a donation in your very own name and leave KFC out of it completely? 

A small donation, maybe the five bucks you would have spent on a bucket, will outdo the 50-cents KFC would have handed over. Plus, you get the credit for your own write-off and you don&apos;t have to take home all that fat, sodium, and calories as a souvenir.

 Do you think KFC&apos;s breast cancer campaign is lovely pink sign of goodwill? Or are you with me in thinking it&apos;s ridiculous for a fast food restaurant to promote that cause through the sale of unhealthy food?

 mariae  •  2 years 0 months ago IT&apos;S JUST AS RIDICULOUS AS THE TOBACCO COMPANIES LOANING MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. I do agree that we are responsible for what we eat, drink,&amp;smoke. We do not need anyone telling us what to do. We should be informed about the dangers, but not punished. It&apos;s all a matter of choice: grilled vs fried, fruit in lieu of pastry, etc. Stop blaming others! Robin J. Sky  •  2 years 3 months ago I think it&apos;s really stupid to support any cause through purchase of consumer goods. If you&apos;re going to buy something, do it because you want to own it or use it, not because it will donate 1% of its profits to something. If you want to support the cause, just donate- that way the charity will get 100% of the money you give. YumYucky.com  •  2 years 3 months ago Wow. What a dummy move. Giz  •  2 years 3 months ago LoriFB: The little bit of&quot;good&quot;they do, doesn&apos;t outweight the whole heck of a lot of bad they do to animals, the enviornment and people. The move is hypocritical and insulting, not good. They help cause more cancer and death than the money they get from those buckets will help prevent/treat/cure. Rosa  •  2 years 3 months ago Umm, did you know you can cut those calories and sodium by a third just by taking the skin off? Seriously, why such hate over chicken that can be made healthy. Also, a bucket costs $10 at least. Obviously you just hate KFC. Don&apos;t be so mean. Fast food joints are in to make a profit, yes, but they are not the cause of all the world&apos;s ills. People died of breast cancer before fast food ever existed Larry  •  2 years 3 months ago Crap food. Who wrote this a 16 year old? How does she talk when she&apos;s not trying to convince people she&apos;s a rational, mature adult? FlowerPower  •  2 years 3 months ago This article reminds me of the whining lady I work with. She&apos;s so scare of everything! She takes care of herself to the extreme and is always so grouchy and always telling people what to do and how to do it.&quot;Don&apos;t do this because this this this and that&quot;! People should be held accountable for their actions. You can&apos;t always babysit people... For petes sakes LIGHTING UP. LoriFB  •  2 years 3 months ago I can&apos;t believe that, these people are trying to do something good (yes, I&apos;m aware is not a super amount to donate per bucket but still...) and everybody&apos;s bitching about it! Don&apos;t you think that, at the very least, the commercials are reminding us of the problem, which makes us more aware? It reminds us daily that people are suffering with this disease and we need to help, no matter how we do it. People have something called a&quot;free will&quot;and will do as they please and eat what they want regardless of what anyone says. So let&apos;s just be glad someone else threw their hat in the ring to help stop breast cancer, help however we choose to, and stop complaining! Tulsa4NowGal  •  2 years 3 months ago I applaud KFC. Let&apos;s be honest there are those of us that want an excuse to eat some good old original recipe. It&apos;s for a great cause. Mauna  •  2 years 3 months ago Yeah, the irony of America; as it believes that it will&quot;Save Lives&quot;through the never ending teachings of how to eat crappy food, to everything else to why there are millions of people who are in the stats of dysfuntional lifestyles to health aspects. Brett Blumenthal - Sheer ...  •  2 years 3 months ago Hab...I agree. I also agree with Jessica, the idea that unhealthy companies promote healthy causes ALWAYS kills me. The Olympics do it even with their sponsors. How is it that McDonalds should be sponsoring the Olympics? And Coke? Also, you have to love the new commercial with all of the beverage companies telling us that they are taking out full calorie beverages from schools...but they are giving them the poison beverages of artificial sweeteners. Hmmm...what else. Coke just had a campaign for something too. The list goes on. Check these out:

http://www.sheerbalance.com/nutrition/coca-cola-like-sunscreen-for-your-insides/ Genevieve  •  2 years 3 months ago Obesity has been linked to breast cancer. KFC donate cause they feel guilty, they contribute to the problem. But why would I make myself sick to help find a cure ??? Nicole  •  2 years 3 months ago i agree with the author. KFC is just making themselves look so ridiculous....what hypocrites. Maybe they felt a little bad for damaging customer&apos;s health so they wanted to repay them in a way. haha yea right. If KFC cared about the health of its patrons it wouldn&apos;t be selling what it does. BetsyD  •  2 years 3 months ago oh the irony that KFC launches this just weeks after major research comes out linking fatty foods and obesity to a greater risk of breast cancer. now we can give ourselves cancer while&apos;fighting&apos;cancer, and the collonel reaps the rewards. sun2go  •  2 years 3 months ago Don&apos;t use the pink ribbon to sell your products. Don&apos;t make anyone eat your chicken, buy your cosmetics, wear your clothes, the list of pink ribbon-itis goes on. Women are dying. Just donate the money if you care. Advertise that you&apos;re doing it, fine, great.

But stop using breast cancer to sell your products, don&apos;t be a pink ribbon pimp. rrm  •  2 years 3 months ago Well I grew up on a farm and can tell everyone in the peta crowd posting here that chickens are a lot more cruel to each other than kfc is to them They well peck each other to death and canabalize each other if you do not watch them this is the reason why farmers clip chickens beaks a little , and frankly chickens are pretty low on the food chain to begin with , they are dumb by bird standards if they were not being farmed they would go extinct rather quickly in the wild . Giz  •  2 years 3 months ago I thought this was pretty funny (not ha ha funnt)too; especially since their food is part of the reason breat cancer (and other cancers) are such an issue in this country. Their disgusting farming practices introduce chemicals and hormones into a person&apos;s body that are detrimental to his or her health and the dangerous level of fat in their products causes weight gain and disturbs organs responsible for producing hormones and insulin and prevents them from functioning properly. Many cases of cancer are actually caused, at least in part, by obesity. KFC chicken is basically a carcinogen. This is something akin to tobacco companies donating proceeds to lung cancer and liquor distributors donating money to liver related health organizations. Amy  •  2 years 3 months ago Jessica needs to take a chill pill. KFC is going to exist, and be delicious, whether we like it or not. And the fact that they are going to donate money is awesome. Why are we always bitching? Why can&apos;t we just be happy with small efforts? Dutch  •  2 years 3 months ago Get a life. I love KFC chicken and I&apos;m not obese, my heart is in great condition and my cholesteral is low. (I&apos;m 60 years old).
I welcome advice on good nutrition, but don&apos;t assume the American public is obese because of KFC or McDonalds. People are accountable for their own choices - in nutrition and in life.

I don&apos;t drink. I don&apos;t smoke. I stay away from as much refined sugar as possible and I try to include plenty of complex carbohydrates in my diet. But when I want to enjoy a bucket of Original Recipe I don&apos;t need busy-bodies or nanny states telling me to eat.

All things in moderation. (At least in diet). ZNemerald  •  2 years 3 months ago Fast food is not meant to be eaten a lot so can everyone stop complaining
