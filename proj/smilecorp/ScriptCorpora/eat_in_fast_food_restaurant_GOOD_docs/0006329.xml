Five Guys Burgers and Fries
 September 18, 2010 By JoshLovesIt 4 Comments 
 Before I moved to Virginia I saw a new fast food restaurant come to our former town. I was kind of bummed because I wanted to finally see a more upscale restaurant come to the area. I also hated fast food, so I didn’t try the new restaurant out. Big mistake. Five Guys Burgers and Fries would prove to be a new favorite.

A few months ago my good buddy Ross took me to the restaurant chain, which had also come to Virginia, and I was blown away. My friend is also somewhat of a maven, so even though I don’t prefer fast food, I decided to trust his rave reviews. I was surprised to see sacks of potatoes stacked up in the front of the store. Ross explained to me that the french fries are freshly cut and are fried in 100% peanut oil, without preservatives. To digress for a moment, the whole preservatives thing turned me off of McDonalds&amp;other fast food restaurants when he left McDonalds fries out for several months and they never molded or decomposed.

Anyways, back to Five Guys. Besides the lack of preservatives and the 100% natural American Beef, I loved the value they offered me with free toppings. I discovered that you can order your hamburger or hot dog any way you like it. Biting into that burger was one of the finer experiences of my life, followed by the heavenly Cajun fries, which come in a grease soaked bag (oh, but it’s worth it).

 

So head on down to your local Five Guys Burger and Fries and let me know what you think. Do you know of another restaurant that I’d like, based off of what I’ve written above? If so, leave a comment below! Also, please share your thoughts on Five Guys Burgers and Fries.

 

P.S. get the double bacon cheeseburger with everything on it!

Here are some cool burger books if you’re up for grilling burgers yourself:

Our family loves this place! It is fun to go in the store and look on the bags stacked in the front of the store to see where the potatoes came from for the day. Every day they come fresh from some place new!

I went to chicago for two weeks. Then we FiveGuys. We said, well looks a bit weird but we are going to try it.

We got our Burgers and we started to eat them. Everybody was starting to smile cause it was just an awesome taste Soon I am going to america again and 1 think what i am really happy about to see again, is the glorious burger of FiveGuys.

AWESOME! TRY.

Grüße auf Deutschland
