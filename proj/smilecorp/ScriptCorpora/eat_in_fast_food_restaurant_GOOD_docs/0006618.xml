  The food is OVER priced and NOT worth it. If you want a REAL dinner go to Boston Fish House in Winter Park. The food there is tasty and fresh and ALWAYS yummy. The menu stated a scallop basket was 14.95, but the bill showed it as 17.95.. NOT worth it. The food was cold, the french fries were OLD, the 3 onion rings didn&apos;t make me feel better for having been ripped off from 14.95 to 17.95 for over-cooked, tasteless scallops...The place is a REAL JOKE!!!! Take the drive to Winter Park and eat REAL seafood at Boston Fish House on Aloma..... Do NOT waste your money at Boston Beef and Seafood..... I have given them &quot;several&quot; tries&quot; and the food remains tasteless, over priced and garbage.... Last week was my LAST chance for them and I told them I was over it when they jumped up the price on the &quot;tiny&quot; meal by four dollars....no notice, no nothing..uh uh.. time for that place to close up...the food SUCKED and I was very unhappy. NO more... A diner

  Born and raised in Massachusetts, loving the Red Sox, and all good seafood. Moved to Florida almost 30 years ago and found Boston&apos;s a few years ago ---- it&apos;s like being home again and the food is fantastic! The haddock I used to remember back home is even better here. I&apos;m in love with the fried clams, scallops and oysters. You can&apos;t go wrong. The service was fantasic, folksy and attentive. You are made to feel comfortable and welcome and get a great meal for your dollars.

  Grills was a Teriffic place to dine. We went all out and really loved it. The service was excellent and we got there late. They didn&apos;t care that we were near closing time. They treated us like we were the ones signing their paychecks, and they meant
