 &quot;Twelve year old boy fights fast food trash&apos; 

 Hi, I&apos;m Jonathan, the creator of GoGreen Man. 

 

 When my family travelled to attend Earth Day on the National Mall &apos;09, my 
parents stopped at a fast food restaurant to pick up a quick meal. After 
we were finished, we were shocked at the amount of garbage that was created. It was then that we decided to see if the popular fast food restaurants 
recycled. To our dismay and surprise, not one restaurant my parents went 
to, recycled. They went to more than 10 popular restaurants in the D.C. 
area. Just think how much garbage goes into a landfill every day from fast 
food restaurants! 

 If we recycled the garbage, how much money could be saved? How much oil 
could be saved for future generations? 

 I decided to make this my quest. My GoGreen Man Quest. Let&apos;s get 
fast food companies to put recycle bins into their stores and show people how 
easy it is to recycle! 

 

 Goals 

 
 Make people aware of the problem
 My parents and I made a video about fast food restaurants and the amount of 
 garbage they make. It was posted to CNN&apos;s iReport and later broadcast on 
 CNN. 
 Research 
 Campaign
 While in Washington D.C., I met some members of Congress (Sen. Klobuchar, 
 MN; Senator Hutchison, TX; Senator Landrieu, LA) to tell them about the 
 garbage problem. I also met with some legislative aides to discuss how 
 to make a bill for fast food restaurant recycling, i.e.,&quot;The Fast Food 
 Restaurant Recycling Act.&quot; 
 Write letters to the fast food restaurants 
 Ask for public support 
 Restaurants put recycling bins in their restaurants 

 

 GoGreen Man&apos;s quest continues!
