In the UK, cash is still by far the most preferred payment option. Practically ever person in the country will spend at least a£10 or a£20 every day. But how often do you or your staff really stop to look at the notes you&apos;re handling? You should do, because counterfeit notes are so prevalent now - and they are getting harder and harder to identify.
One of the biggest problems facing cash-handling companies is that the typical ways to check notes such as holograms or watermarks, are no longer enough to spot most forgeries. This is because the forgers have developed their printing skills so that the notes they produce imitate these basic security features very convincingly. Therefore if your organisation handles cash, you are advised to look at devices that check for advanced security features, rather than just the basic ones, if you dont want to get caught out.

 
 Guide to understanding the differences found between BASIC and ADVANCED security features on banknotes 

1) Basic security features on notes




     Check the paper and raised print
 Check the hologram
     Check the watermark
 Check the print quality
 
 
 Check the microprint
 Check the colour-shifting ink
 
 
  Check the metallic thread
 Check the see-through register
 

 2) Advanced security features on notes 




&gt; Ultra Violet (uv) detection . Invisible to the naked eye, the majority of world banknotes have 2 or 3 different types of uv features that can be identified with a uv detector. With English notes the denomination of the£5 note,£10 note, old-£20 note, new£20 note but not the£50 note have the denomination (&apos;10&apos; or &apos;20&apos; etc) printed invisibly using uv ink. Scottish and Irish banknotes have various intricate designs combined with a series of uv barcodes. When a uv detector is used to check the note, these features are illuminated.


&gt; Size detection. Many automatic note checkers and note counters have a size detection facility. Size detection is ideal in a note counter as it can help you identify &apos;rogue&apos; denominations in a bundle (i.e. a£10 note in a bunch of£20 notes). In an automatic note checker, the size data is captured and relayed to the on-screen add or count features.


&gt; Infra Red (ir) detection. While generally less popular than uv detection, ir detection is still highly useful as most currencies have invisible ir security features.


&gt; Magnetic ink detection. The US Dollar is regularly demonstrated in schools and colleges all over the world as the currency with the highest magnetism, and basic tests can be done to show how notes are heavily magnetised with magnetic ink. Other banknotes such as Euros, Scottish Pounds, Irish Pounds have magnetic serial numbers.


&gt; Magnetic thread detection. English pounds and Euro banknotes are famous for their heavily magnetised threads which are virtually impossible to counterfeit. Therefore one of the key detection mechanisms used by automatic note checkers is to check for the magnetic thread.


&gt; Coded magnetic thread detection . The metallic thread of many bank notes (inc English and Euros) can have a secret magnetic coding (almost like a digital signal coding) which is different for every note denomination. Special sensors on some automatic note checkers can detect the presence and even read the code.

 How do note checker pens work? 


The practise of counterfeiting money is as old as the printing of money itself. In Britain, the first banknotes were printed over 300 years ago and they were closely followed by a series of very convincing and particularly successful imitations.

Since then there have been numerous advances in anti-counterfeit technology; from &apos;raised prints&apos; and &apos;see-through registers&apos;, to the rumoured introduction of technologies to help banknote detectors such as microchips inside the fabric of notes. Yet the counterfeiters still manage to succeed in mass-producing notes that pass though the publics&apos; hands un-noticed.
 
One of the simplest ways to identify counterfeits is to test the &apos;paper&apos; fabric itself. As the supply of genuine banknote paper is restricted and controlled by the authorities, the type of paper used by the counterfeiters can differ greatly.


The majority of world banknotes are manufactured from cotton, and are often mixed with linen or other textile fibers. They do not contain any starch, so they wont react with Iodine. This is where the note checker pens come in. note checker pens contain a very simple Iodine solution, which upon contact with a genuine note, will create a mark which is yellowish or clear. On a note made with paper containing starch, the mark is black or brown. In general, note checker pens are most effective against notes printed on standard printer or photocopier paper. 

 How reliable are note checker pens then? 


The manufacturers of note checker pens claim that pens will detect a great majority of counterfeit notes, but critics suggest the effectiveness of note checker pens is much lower. Critics claim that professional counterfeiters use starch-free paper, thus making the note checker pen unable to detect a large percentage of counterfeit money in circulation. However, not all fake notes are made professionally, so note checker pens can be very effective and offer a great visible deterrent against those attempting to pass fake notes. Note checker pens are also inexpensive, and many can be distributed to cashier personnel in numbers for little outlay.

 

 Quality guidelines for note checker pens
 

 

 

Good quality note checker pens or other iodine-based banknote detectors need to have the correct chemical balance in order for them to identify fake notes properly.


 

 

As the paper that banknotes are made of typically consists of cotton, linen and other fabrics, the percentage of iodine in the pen can affect the quality of the note checker pens result. Insufficient iodine will render the note checker pen useless. Cheap note checker pens from an unusual source may often be made cheaply just to get the sale and will be a poor banknote detector. High-quality note checker pens from Note Checkers . Com always have the ideal solution inside them to act as an accurate banknote detector.


 



Once more, if you buy quality note checker pens, you expect them to stand the test of time. All note checker pens from Note Checkers . Com have been quality tested against leakage and they will typically last you a long time.


 Foreign currency and note checker pens 




Any genuine fabric-based note should work perfectly well with note checker pens. Some foreign banknotes can be made out of plastic (such as Australian Dollars and the Irish£5 see below) and so note checker pens will not be able to validate these banknotes. Other banknote detectors do work well such as uv detectors.



 
 

 How do uv detectors work? 

( Nerd alert! ) ultra violet (uv) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light, but longer than x-rays, in the range 10 nm to 400 nm. It is so named because the spectrum consists of electromagnetic waves with frequencies higher than those that humans identify as the color violet. When subjected to the light omitted from a uv LED or uv light, many substances will naturally glow or fluoresce. It is this special reaction that is commonly used in household or office property marking with a uv ink pen, as the ink which is invisible to the naked eye is applied to the item of property (TV, laptop, games console etc), only to be identified by the police with a uv detector once recovered.  
 
 

 

 

 Quality guidelines for uv detectors 

 

 

 

 

 

Like in many aspect of life, cheaper isn&apos;t always better. Good quality uv detectors or uv LED&apos;s will omit light at the correct frequency for the job intended. The recommended frequency for uv on British banknotes is approx 365nm. It is at this frequency that invisible uv ink markings will become perfectly visible when using uv detectors. Cheaper nastier uv detectors are supplied (not by this site) at 380-390+ nm. This can create huge problems, as what may appear to be a genuine note, may be deemed counterfeit by accident as the poor quality uv detector has been the wrong frequency to highlighting the correct features.

Also, the paper that banknotes are made of typically consists of starch, linen and other fabrics. These will reflect &apos;dull&apos; under a uv detector. In the majority of cases, if forged banknotes have been made using normal paper, the forgery will be &apos;uv bright&apos; under a uv detector (as opposed to genuine being &apos;uv dull&apos;). This is not a fool-proof way to check for forgeries as, apart from professionally made counterfeits which bypass this check, you must allow for banknotes to have been washed which inadvertently can become uv bright with the intervention of detergent etc.

 

  UV Features on the New November 2011 issue£50 banknote 


 
 
 

Ultra-violet feature - if you look at the front of the new-style£50 note under a good quality ultra-violet light the number 50 appears in bright red and green. The five windows of the motion thread also appear in bright green. Randomly spread bright red and green flecks are also visible on both the front and back of the note. The remainder of the note appears dull in contrast.

All UV Detectors available from Notecheckers.com will check the new 50 Pound notes


 
 
 
Another aspect of quality is safety. Good quality, compliant uv detectors will be CE Approved, meet RoHS requirements and will have been EMC tested. All uv detectors supplied by Note Checkers. Com meet this criteria. While this means our costs go up for our suppliers, we know that we are supplying excellent quality uv detectors which will be safe and fit for purpose.
 
Once more, if you buy quality uv detectors, you expect them to stand the test of time. All uv detectors from Note Checkers . Com come with a standard 12 months warranty. But this will not cover the uv bulb. As the bulbs within the uv detectors may need replacing, we supply discounted, replacement uv bulbs direct from this website for your convenience.

 Motion thread on the new£50 pound note 

  

Motion thread - the motion thread on the new-style£50 note is woven into the paper. It has five windows along its length which contain images of the£symbol and the number 50. When the note is tilted from side to side, the images move up and down. When the note is tilted up and down, the images move from side to side and the number 50 and£symbol switch.


 General use of uv detectors 

 

uv detectors come in many shapes and sizes. Some are tiny uv keyrings, some are to be worn around the neck or wrist or positioned in a vehicle. Most are designed for desktop use. Some of the basic uv detectors have uv bulbs only and nothing else. Some of the more advanced uv detector designs will incorporate multi-functional uv detection. Such as uv detectors with white light, or uv detectors with magnetic detection. Again Note Checkers.Com can also supply uv detectors with 3,4 or 5 other banknote detector functions.

 
 UV detectors and Scottish and Irish Pounds Sterling 


The uv security features on Northern Irish and Scottish banknotes are very different to those of the English notes. Northern Ireland and Scottish banknotes have some intricate designs unique to each note, but they all contain uv &apos;barcode&apos; designs similar to the one displayed below (the dark purple areas represent as seen under a uv detector);
 
In addition to property marking and banknote identification, uv detectors are also very useful in identifying genuine credit&amp;debit cards, driving licenses, concert tickets and other similar media.  
 
 Notes on safety when using uv detectors 

When changing the bulb on a uv detector:- 1. Always unplug the uv detector from the mains supply (if powered by mains) 2. Follow instructions supplied with uv detector carefully if removal of covers is required. 3. Replace the broken bulb on the uv detector. 4. Replace the covers on the uv detector. 5. If you are uncertain please pass the uv detector to a qualified electrician only. 6. When using uv detectors, they must be positioned at a height that wont allow persons to see directly at the uv bulb within close proximity (25/35cm away from your eyes). 7. It is also advisable that the user does not expose their skin to the light from a uv detector continuously for over an hour.

 Other important points to note 

 
 
 

It is true that many counterfeit banknotes in circulation contain some form of uv features designed to imitate or replicate the genuine article. Caution should always be taken when relying on any one individual security feature when attempting to identify genuine banknotes. Note Checkers . Com offer a full range of uv detectors that also allow you to check for Magnetic, Infra Red, Watermark and other features in banknotes. Further information on uv detectors or other types of banknote detectors can be obtained from the banknote-issuing authority or central bank.

 

 H ow do automatic note checkers work? 

An automatic note detector brings the highly accurate and sophisticated technology used by bank cash centers right to your own cash desk. To some this can be daunting, but once you have used and automatic note checker it is pretty difficult to go back.


Instead of being reliant on the standard security features found in banknotes, automatic note checkers validate advanced security features that are more covert and hidden from the naked eye. For example, magnetic inks, magnetic threads and infra red inks are the main focus of sensors inside automatic note checkers.


 Forgery detection jargon buster for automatic note checkers :- 


 Size Detection. For automatic note checkers size detection is used to give the note denomination which is handy for automatic note checkers with denomination or add mode.
 Ultra Violet. Nowadays, with uv detection, only simple counterfeit banknotes will be identified. This function is handy when used in conjunction with advanced security features
 Magnetic Ink . Only some bank notes actually contain magnetic inks or serial numbers, therefore it can be very effective. The more common notes with magnetic ink are US Dollars, Euros, Scottish Banks and some Irish Banks
 Magnetic Thread . Many bank notes contain a metal thread within the paper substrate which has some magnetic properties. A centrally placed or series of MG sensors on the automatic note checker can detect the presence of a magnetic security thread very effectively. All automatic note checkers available from Note Checkers . Com have this feature as it is essential for English Pounds and Euros detection.
 Coded Magnetic Thread . The metallic thread of many bank notes (inc English and Euros) can have a secret magnetic coding (almost like a digital signal coding) which is different for every note denomination. Special sensors on some automatic note checkers can detect the presence and even read the code.
 

 Who should use an automatic note checker? 

More and more cash-handling companies are doing so. You may pay a little more for automatic note checkers up front (please ask if you qualify for a credit account with us) but you are increasing the accuracy straight away and there will be no uv bulbs, batteries or re-orders necessary for a long time. Here are a few examples:-


 Mini Supermarket 

You have a small collection of tills, some of which are only used at the busiest periods. Having used uv detectors and note checker pens (if anything) in the past, you are now alarmed that fake notes are being successfully passed in your shop and valuable time is being spent checking notes. Many of which turn out to be genuine. While you are frustrated, your cashiers say they are trying their best. To stop the problem immediately, you could order a small quantity of automated note checkers with the rechargeable battery option to pass over or between the tills as they open or close as and when required. Keeping your automatic note checker in a prominent position gives you a tremendous visible deterrent against the forger and after one investment, you have a solution that will last you for a long time, without spending any more money ongoing thereafter.


 Fast-food restaurant 

With a constant stream of customers through the door, or via the drive through, cash comes at you from every direction and you cannot afford to slow the cashiers down. You have a large number of staff and you cash up regularly during the day. As most of your staff are younger and more inexperienced at handling cash, you are prime target for forgers. By informing staff to pass all notes through the automatic note checker, you take the pressure off them, and allow 100% of your notes to be checked for advanced security features in a fraction of a second per note. Modern automatic note checkers actually speed up the payment process. All this without you having to spend hours of your own time on what may be futile staff training and the problem is solved.

 Busy retailer 


With the recession, the margins for error are now smaller than ever. The risk for internal theft (and people swapping fake notes for genuine) is high. Okay, you have high card payments over cash, but the cash transactions are a target. By installing just 1 automatic note checker at the till, and by encouraging your staff to use it, you present a fool-proof solution and outstanding deterrent for very little outlay, that will speed up your payment processes, not upset or offend any customer and last you for a long, long time to come.


 Foreign exchange 


Banknotes are your business, and you know better than most that the standard and quality of forged notes are getting better all the time. Which ever way you look at it, you need to stop accepting forged notes from customers, the bank or anywhere else. You may handle predominantly US Dollars, Euros, Sterling and perhaps one or two other currencies in the main, so a bank tested, multicurrency automatic note checker that handles all these currencies in one application would be ideal. You may also need a print-out for count data or serial numbers - no problem. We have that all in one banknote detector device!

 Will Scottish and Irish Pounds Sterling notes work with automated note checkers? 


The security features on Northern Irish and Scottish banknotes are very different to those of the English notes. Northern Ireland and Scottish banknotes have some intricate designs unique to each note, but they also lack the magnetic threads that most automatic note checkers look for. For this reason, most automatic note checkers will not provide an accurate note validation on Irish and Scottish notes. Therefore uv detectors or note checker pens are the best solution for these notes.
