 Download   U N I T U N I T   1 U N I T U N I T It almost looks as though this whooping crane is jumping for joy. Although this “dance” is actually a courtship display, whooping cranes do have reason to jump for joy — they are lucky to be alive. In the 1940s just 22 whooping cranes could be found in the world. Today, their numbers are slowly increasing, but whooping cranes are still an endangered species. These majestic birds spend their summers in northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. Like all living organisms, whooping cranes interact with their environment. They need food, water, and a clean environment in which to live. In this unit you will examine some questions about living things and their environment. Why do organisms live where they do? How do they interact with one another and with their environment? How and why do they become extinct? Humans interact with the environment and with other living things, and we need a healthy environment too. Unfortunately, some human activities affect ecosystems in negative ways. It was largely due to people’s actions that the populations of whooping cranes declined, but people have also helped their populations recover. In this unit you will learn how we can observe and monitor changes in ecosystems, and how we can measure the impacts of our actions. As well, you will learn how people are working to improve our environment and to help reverse some past mistakes.

In Topics 1–3 you will look at how living things interact with one another and with the environment in which they live. You will see how we have learned from our past mistakes. You will also examine some of the choices we can make to improve our environment. • How do human activities affect ecosystems? • What methods can we use to observe and monitor changes in ecosystems? • How can we assess the impacts of our actions? U N I T 1 U N I T 1 In Topics 4 and 5, you’ll explore the roles that organisms play within an ecosystem. You will ﬁnd answers to questions such as: What are the links in a food web? What happens if an ecosystem changes? How do nutrients, water, energy, and even pollution cycle through ecosystems? 4 MHR • Interactions and Ecosystems page 1 of 36 of 00
