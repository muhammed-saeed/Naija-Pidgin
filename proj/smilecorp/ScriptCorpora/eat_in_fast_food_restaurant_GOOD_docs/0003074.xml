What is the difference in travel times? It might be okay at non-peak times, but during rush hour? Yikes... KGB May 19th, 2007, 05:40 AM And making an assertion that a city is boring because its subway is boring is illogical.


Well, YOU&apos;RE the one making that assertion, in case you haven&apos;t realized that. What you fail to realize, and should pay more attention to...is comments like this one...Well, aside from the fact that isaidso is being overdramatic ...You are being so over-the-top ridiculous with your comments, and incorrect in the assertions as well, that people stop seeing any truth that&quot;may&quot;lie somewhere in your comments (benefit of the doubt here), and simply can&apos;t take ANYTHING you say seriously. I would really take a second look at your approach if you want to be taken seriously...I have serious critisisms of the city and it&apos;s transit, but could never get to the point of discusssing them with someone like you, because you can&apos;t put it any realistic perspective.



You are going off on a tangent talking about gay pride, vibrancy, and diversity. Toronto is very vibrant. Who said it wasn&apos;t? We are talking about subways!


Well, uh...YOU are the one who went off on that tangent...not me. You are the one making this comment.....Like alot of Toronto, the subway cars are as bland as possible. It&apos;s the ultra conservative, stubbornly rigid, Scottish roots of this city at play.

I mean...could anybody characterize the city any less accurately????

Like I said...stop getting so silly about it and making ridiculous sweeping analogies regarding the city as a whole, and focus on the topic. You&apos;ll find yourself not having to defend these comments, and accusing people of what you are actually guilty of. Then perhaps, a sensible discussion about it may emerge.




KGB hkskyline May 22nd, 2007, 06:22 AM TTC vows to improve worker safety record
21 May 2007
The Globe and Mail

The death of a subway maintenance worker crushed in a tunnel accident last month was just the latest warning sign that the Toronto Transit Commission has a serious problem on its hands.

The number of TTC workers injured on the job has jumped significantly in the past four years–the agency&apos;s rate of 5.8 lost-time injuries per 100 employees in 2006 was higher than the average in the North American urban transit business (of 4.2). Worker-injury claims cost the TTC $9.2-million in 2006, up from $8.5-million in 2002.

The interim chief general manager of the TTC, Gary Webster, concedes the transit agency has a growing problem, but in the wake of last month&apos;s crash he said he is serious about fixing the TTC&apos;s“safety culture.”

Last month&apos;s collision, which killed 38-year-old Antonio Almeida, a father of two, was by no means the first alarm bell. In February of 2006, a high-profile carbon-monoxide poisoning incident in a tunnel that made eight workers and four firefighters seriously ill forced the TTC to realize it had a serious problem, demanding an improved worker safety environment, Mr. Webster said.

“We&apos;re very good at reacting to accidents and making sure that specific accidents don&apos;t happen again,”Mr. Webster said in an interview.“…It&apos;s like putting your finger in the dike. That hole will never come there again, but it&apos;s popping out somewhere else. And why is that?”

Comparing last month&apos;s crash to the 1995 Russell Hill subway accident, which killed three passengers and forced the TTC to undergo radical changes to improve passenger safety, Mr. Webster said what he called the“Almeida factor”was now spurring an overhaul of worker safety within the transit agency.

Small changes have already been made. While the early-morning collision is still under investigation, the working theory is that a scaffold-like piece of equipment, perhaps stowed improperly on a flatbed work car, snagged a cable on the subway-tunnel wall as Mr. Almeida drove the train in.

In the days after the crash, Mr. Webster said, the TTC ordered all other overnight maintenance crews using similar work cars to follow a detailed checklist procedure–already in place when work cars go out–when finishing up. Signed checklists stating that all equipment was properly secured before pulling away from the work site are now required to be submitted the next morning, he said.

The heightened vigilance about safety among the work crews that descend into the TTC&apos;s dark subway tunnels was clear, too, Mr. Webster said.

At least two maintenance crews refused to work right after the crash, citing unsafe conditions–as is their right under Ontario&apos;s labour laws.

In one case, a crew determined they did not have enough of the special slings used to secure equipment.In fact, the TTC boss recently issued an internal memo to all 10,000 employees, reminding them of their right to refuse work they believe to be unsafe.

Bob Kinnear, president of Local 113 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said he supported management&apos;s recent moves and pledged to work with TTC leaders to improve safety.

Next month, TTC officials will present the transit agency&apos;s nine-member commission made up of city councillors with a report on safety initiatives that has been in the works since the carbon-monoxide incident. The report will also address concerns raised by the crash that killed Mr. Almeida.

The TTC has also drafted a plan to hire an external company to assist in a total overhaul of the TTC&apos;s safety programs, and in Mr. Webster&apos;s words,“hold our feet to the fire.”

Among the companies expected to bid is global giant DuPont, which has a division that specializes in safety. hkskyline June 15th, 2007, 03:35 AM More for the entire system, not just the subways :

Crimes on TTC jumped in 2006
Handheld devices become target
9 June 2007
The Globe and Mail

More crimes were committed on Toronto&apos;s public transportation system in 2006 than in any of the previous six years, according to a recently released TTC report.

Toronto Transit Commission figures show crime rates jumped sharply last year, in large part due to the increasing number of riders carrying handheld electronic devices, which make for appealing and easy targets.

In all, there were 3,415 Criminal Code offences on the TTC, substantially higher than the five-year average of 2,793. The number of crimes committed against customers increased to 1,601, compared with the five-year average of 1,194. The number of arrests on the TTC jumped from 830 in 2005 to 986 last year.

Over all, the transit crime rate was at its highest level since 2000, the earliest year for which data was readily available.

I wouldn&apos;t call crime out of control on the system, TTC chairman Adam Giambrone said. We do have a slight increase. We&apos;ve found in other areas that these increases sometimes are blips we hope that&apos;s what it is.

TTC Chief Special Constable Terry Andrews said a number of factors contributed to the spike, including several large fraud investigations. In one such case, an investigation involving Canadian and U.S. authorities busted up a multimillion-dollar counterfeit token ring.

But TTC constables have also seen a jump in the number of thefts, which they say is directly related to the increase in cellphones, music players and other handheld electronic devices that commuters carry.

These are attractive targets, Special Constable Andrews said, not only on the TTC, but we&apos;ve also seen a rash of such incidents within the community.

But while the majority of crimes don&apos;t result in serious injuries, there have been a number of violent incidents in TTC locations recently. On May 31, a TTC employee was stabbed repeatedly at the Lawrence West subway station. Police allege an assailant walked up to the employee, who was in the collector&apos;s booth, and tossed a cup of gasoline at the booth. The assailant then demanded the employee open the booth door. When the employee complied, the assailant stabbed him, took a handful of cash and ran off.

The most serious TTC crime in recent months took place on April 13 at the Kennedy subway station. Police found Nick Brown, 21, badly wounded inside an otherwise empty subway car he had been stabbed and later died of his injuries. Less than a week later, a 16-year-old was stabbed in the back as he stood on a bus platform at the same station. The stabbings prompted the TTC to boost the number of special constables manning the station.

In 2005, the TTC approved a $6.5-million plan to hire an additional 102 staff members over the next 10 years, virtually all of them special constables. The new hires, in turn, have helped facilitate larger investigations ranging from fake metro-pass operations to iPod snatchings and parking-lot thefts.

We continue to monitor the trends, and when we see a spike we aggressively go after it, Special Constable Andrews said. Over the years it seems we&apos;ve moved from one issue to another. elkram June 15th, 2007, 08:33 PM Congratulations, Ontario! this all seems quite promising:

Even if they started construction before the election, if John Tory wins (heaven forbid), all construction would be halted immediately and all work be undone restored to the state prior to groundbreaking. That&apos;s what happened in 1995 and it would happen again. We need to learn from our history and make sure the same mistakes are not repeated. The only government that has been serious about building subways in a non-political-oriented fashion in the past 2 decades is the Rae NDP. elkram June 18th, 2007, 05:52 PM Wanna wait

The Toronto Transit Commission is planning to close the Sheppard subway, drop 21 bus routes and raise fares because of city funding shortages, chairman Adam Giambrone said Thursday.

An emergency meeting of the commission board is scheduled for Friday to formalize the cuts, he told reporters.

&quot;This is a horrible day,&quot;Giambrone said.

Honestly, I am really getting sick and tired of all this &apos;fear mongering&apos; Toronto&apos;s politicians are doing in order to squeeze more money from the government. I&apos;m not saying they don&apos;t need to pay up, but for months now we have been hearing about all these ludicrous new taxes and service cuts but like always, nothing is being done.

All this is because it is an election year. But you know what, it is the provincial and federal elections, not municipal. If your entire campaign was based off of someone else&apos;s potential choices, then it shows you are a very poor leader. And your constituents deserve better than you (though in another way, they elected you so they get what they deserve).

Only thing that will happen is maybe a fare hike in April, though fares will still be lower than most GTA transit services and with much better service. The Sheppard line ain&apos;t going anywhere - at most it will be converted into a tunneled LRT or BRT, but I wouldn&apos;t count on it. KGB July 20th, 2007, 05:17 AM &quot;Doomsday Budgets&quot;seem to be all the rage for cities and their transit systems these days for getting funding from upper levels of governments.

Hardly....

In Philadelphia, SEPTA faces a $130 million operating deficit and predicts that without financial help from the state legislature it&quot;will raise fares by an average of 31 percent, cut service by 20 percent, and lay off 300 to 400 employees.&quot;(A sign of the magnitude of what to expect from the CTA&apos;s upcoming doomsday plans?) The SEPTA board is set to vote on the doomsday budget on May 24.


Chicago&apos;s CTA has announced what media are calling a&quot;doomsday budget&quot;which forecasts their plans on how to cope if the Illinois state legislature doesn&apos;t pony up more money. Among the highlights would be fare increases to as much as $3.25 for rush hour rail and many cutbacks including closing the Yellow Line which is a segment of the former North Shore interurban line.


Mayor Michael Bloomberg outlined a doomsday budget Tuesday, hoping to put the pressure on Albany to avoid a contingency plan that would mean thousands of layoffs and deep service cuts affecting virtually all aspects of city life, from the police and fire departments to schools and zoos.


The so-called doomsday budget is intended to scare the bejeebers out of legislators and voters alike, which it apparently did, producing cartoon balloons of groans, grimaces, tut-tuts and told-ya-sos.

But strictly speaking, the doomsday budget is an exercise in pointillism without a point.

It is commissioned, as an annual rite of higher mathematics (those who dont need their fingers to count beyond 10), by the General Assemblys presiding officers but, in fact, the hypothetical document gives the governor a flat-liner spread-sheet from which to begin passing the tambourine yet another time.

So now Maryland finds itself in the hole by $1.5 billion (and counting), most of it laid at the clay feet of Former Gov. Parris Glendening (D), who unwisely cut income taxes by $700 million a year as an election-year gift (to himself) and signed the $1.3.billion Thornton education program into law without providing the money to pay for it. (This in itself may have been unconstitutional, because, by Maryland law, all money bills must have a fiscal note, or funding source, attached.)

Among 150 possibilities on the doomsday list were state employees pay increases and retiree health benefits; drug abuse programs; funding for education; children with disabilities; college tuitions; the prison system; and local governments which would be forced to pay half of teachers retirement costs.

I don&apos;t think that Canadians can fully understand how poorly funded these systems are from their state and the US governments. Both the states and the federal government regularily seem to be hell bent on extinguishing cities in this country and show that through the painful budgets they write. It&apos;s not fear mongering, it&apos;s the reality of urban governance in the United States. From what I understand, and from what I have personally seen in Toronto, the TTC has appeared to be severely short of money for some time now. Maybe I am wrong.

I thought he was saying that making big (and somewhat disingenuous) threats around election time was a tactic many transit agencies use to get more money out of politicians.


he he...well, both of those are true as well, but the excact point I was making at the time, was that all transit systems face budget/revenue/maintenance issues, because the costs of operating, maintaining and making capital purchases for transit systems is a strain on whatever budget is required to pay it...be it federal, state or provincial, or municipal In Toronto&apos;s case, this cost is bourne entirely by the municipal government at the moment (with the odd one-time handout).

Now, Toronto has an advantage over most (or all) large transit agencies, in that it has such a high cost recovery. The cost to the city (and the tax payer), is only $260 million annually...to run the 2nd largest transit system in Canada or the USA. That is ridiculously cheap, when you consider the size of the city&apos;s budget.

With a nearly $8 billion operational budget, the city could easily allocate the required funds to the TTC by simply cutting funds elsewhere. It could also raise taxes to increase revenue to cover it. It can also use it as a political football to shame the feds and province into giving the city the funds it deserves.

Notice how this comes on the heels of Queen&apos;s Park&apos;s big announcement of $17.5 billion for transit, and after upper levels of government bragging about other money, like gas taxes, etc? You&apos;d think the city would be celebrating...but that&apos;s not how the game works.

There&apos;s no way the city is going to close down subway lines and drastically shut down service...it would be completely against their plane. Back when the city got downloaded with ALL transit costs, the name of the game was cost efficiency...that&apos;s why the fare box was covering over 80% of the opertional costs...cause the budget would only allow so much...so the fares HAD to cover the balance.

But in the last few years, the game completely changed...upper levels of government have said they would give money, but ONLY based on ridership increases. Since cutting services and raising fares did indeed make it very cost-efficient, it also meant lost ridership. So now that it&apos;s all about ridership increases, the city has completely changed the game-plan, and has been increasing services, and implimenting incentives (like transferable metropasses), and it has worked very well...this year, the TTC will probably see ridership meet or eclipse it&apos;s all-time ridership levels of the late 80&apos;s.

But, that money has not been rolling in from upper levels of government in the time-frame they expected, or in the amounts they expected...and it&apos;s not something you can budget on because you don&apos;t know when, or how much.

So this is the kind of game you see happening....the city feels it&apos;s been playing the game, with the required results, but it doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s been getting the rewards it was promised. They have made huge strides in increasing ridership, but it has come at the cost of lost revenue....cost recovery.

This is why they aren&apos;t going to shut down subways and cut services and routes...it would mean huge lost ridership, and there&apos;s no way they are going to screw that up after working so hard to gain all the ridership they have.


As for the subways being&quot;dilipidated&quot;...don&apos;t be silly...Toronto&apos;s subway&apos;s&quot;state-of-good-repair&quot;is quite good, especially for a 50 year-old system. We can thank David Gunn for all that work in the 90&apos;s. The trains run on time, the rolling stock is practically new. What are people bassing this on...a few aestetics in some older subway stations? Com&apos;on. You need to see a REAL dilapidated subways system to appreciate it. The city has made sure it has invested the dollars on the&quot;behind the scenes&quot;nuts and bolts&quot;stuff that is required to keep and aging subways system from really becoming a mess...take a look at what it did to NYC....derailments and track fires happened almost DAILY!! The city has alocated $717 million for 2007 alone for capital purchases.

TTC plans to spend $6.4M federal grant to beef up surveillance, cut vandalism, crime
Toronto Star
6 September 2007

The TTC will use a $6.4 million federal grant announced by Ottawa yesterday to install security cameras at all major subway entrances.

The cameras, already present at 15 stations, will be system-wide by 2009, according to TTC chief general manager Gary Webster. They&apos;re part of a plan to install surveillance devices in all TTC vehicles and on subway platforms to discourage vandalism and crime.

In April, police were able to arrest a suspect in a subway-car homicide because an image was captured of a person leaving Kennedy station.

But transit officials are also deeply concerned about the threat of terrorism and plan to bulk up the special constables force over the next five years.

&quot;Canada has been purported to be on a list of targets for terrorists, and Toronto&apos;s an important city,&quot;said Webster.

Under yesterday&apos;s federal transportation announcement, Union Station will get $4.8 million to install an emergency communications system that will allow officials to direct commuters in the event of another incident like the 2004 hostage-taking, in which a man held a gun to a woman&apos;s head on Front St. as passengers streamed out of the station.

The funding is part of about $12 million Ottawa will spend to improve transit security across Canada, Burlington MP Mike Wallace said at Union Station yesterday.

TTC chair Adam Giambrone praised the security measures Ottawa has supported but said no money has come for industrial security projects, such as protecting the Hillcrest complex where the TTC does much of its behind-the-scenes work. Tens of millions of dollars are needed to secure the TTC&apos;s other facilities and hundreds of millions to build fire and ventilation protections in the subways. Some $250 million is needed for security in the next five years, he said.

But public transit will never reflect the level of security seen at airports, according to Michael Roschlau, president of the Canadian Urban Transportation Association.

&quot;Moving a lot of people quickly means you can&apos;t have security barriers of that nature,&quot;he said.&quot;It destroys the very nature of public transportation when you start to put barriers in places that impede the flow of people.&quot; winstainforth September 10th, 2007, 12:31 AM Subways to get more security cameras

An investigation into whether privacy laws would be violated by installing thousands of security cameras throughout the country&apos;s largest public transit network will likely be a test case for other Canadian jurisdictions contemplating similar surveillance systems to deter crime or terror attacks, experts say.

“Anything that happens in Ontario…and in Toronto in particular, will be closely examined in other jurisdictions in Canada,”said Ariane Siegel, a privacy expert and partner at Gowlings law firm in Toronto.

“Not only by municipal organizations, but by other organizations as well.”

The Toronto Transit Commission is in the process of installing up to 10,000 security cameras in its buses, streetcars and subway system, adding to its current network of about 1,500 cameras.

That prompted London-based Privacy International to lodge a complaint Wednesday with Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian, denouncing the project as an unnecessary waste of resources that violates Canadian privacy laws.

TTC chairman Adam Giambrone has defended the plan, saying it conforms to privacy guidelines because the information will not be viewed live and will be accessed only by the police. Electrify October 31st, 2007, 09:59 PM TTC security-camera challenge seen as test case

Not only by municipal organizations, but by other organizations as well.

The Toronto Transit Commission is in the process of installing up to 10,000 security cameras in its buses, streetcars and subway system, adding to its current network of about 1,500 cameras.

That prompted London-based Privacy International to lodge a complaint Wednesday with Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian, denouncing the project as an unnecessary waste of resources that violates Canadian privacy laws.

TTC chairman Adam Giambrone has defended the plan, saying it conforms to privacy guidelines because the information will not be viewed live and will be accessed only by the police.

I believe the Viva buses in York Region have CCTV cameras installed in them. And I don&apos;t see what makes this different than a security camera in a mall.

Here is hoping this gets thrown out before it costs too much money. And if it does end up costing the TTC millions, it will come out of this ambulance chasing lawfirm. isaidso November 2nd, 2007, 03:43 AM It&apos;s true that every city faces financing issues regarding their subways, but Toronto&apos;s subway is an embarassment.

Downtown Toronto is rapidly densifying, yet we have only one single subway that was built 50 years ago! One 50 year old north-south subway in the entire downtown is ridiculous. That is NOT a subway system.

You have to travel 30 blocks north to Bloor before you can go east or west. The platforms are puny, the halls too narrow, and the escalators insufficient. Where are the subways along King, Queen, Dundas, College, Wellesley, Bathurst, Spadina, Sherbourne, and Parliament?

The only thing more ridiculous is that some Torontonians think that a subway system along these routes is lavish. It is not. We have simply become used to going without. I just hope that when we get 4 or 5 more lines south of Bloor that they have the sense to build them large enough to handle a population explosion over the next 50 years. If not, we&apos;ll end up with another London. One line goes down, and the system almost comes to a crushing standstill.

In a way, we have two lines through downtown. Or at the very least, we have one line but it services two separate north-south corridors.

Beyond that, I do agree that we should have some form of east-west rapid transit through downtown, and not have to goto Bloor. Hell, imo Bloor shouldn&apos;t even have a subway!!! Sure it was seeing more ridership as the city continued to grow out, but Queen would have helped set the stage to bring people back into the core, and have helped to create a transit friendly downtown.

On the plus side, few cities will you find subways running every 2-3 minutes through rush hour. allurban November 3rd, 2007, 07:00 AM The city doesn&apos;t have money to build 4 or 5 more lines.The city had enough trouble finding enough money to build 5 km of the Sheppard line...so sadly, I dont think anyone would consider 4-5 subway lines...

Lets see....1 km of subway would cost about $200 million after everything is taken into account...

That $200 million would also build about 8 km of LRT line (assuming LRT costs $25 mn/km.

So, which would you prefer?

Toronto, Ontario, and Canada have few equals on this planet when it comes to wealth. There is money all over the place, what is lacking is the political will to spend the money on subways in Toronto. If Ontario, or the feds deemed this a priority, we&apos;d be getting subways hand over fist. This country is $15 Billion is surplus EVERY year, and that figure is growing despite aggressive tax cuts. There&apos;s not another G8 nation awash in so much cash.

The screams of poverty are ridiculous. Cities and nations many times poorer than us find billions for subways. The fact remains that Torontonians don&apos;t demand the money be allocated here, nor do we see what an important investment it is in our economic future. It is mindboggling that this intolerable situation has managed to continue year after year.

The Jubilee Line subway extension in London cost $5.1 Billion for 11 miles of track in 1999. London is NOT a wealthier city than Toronto. The UK is NOT wealthier than Canada either. The British understand how important the success of London is not only to Londoners, but to all of Britain. Toronto, Ontario, and Canada need to wake up.

Electrify: Bloor should have a subway. I think what you are saying is that Queen should have gotten one first. The reason that our downtown has developed north along Yonge rather than east and west along the lake is simple. Lack of transportation infrastructure: there is no subway! I hear it over and over again. Office tower developers don&apos;t want to build west of University Avenue because workers need an effective way to travel to work. A subway is the only form of transport that can move such high volumes. Till we get a subway heading east and west from the core, development will continue to concentrate where it currently lies. iampuking November 4th, 2007, 02:19 AM If not, we&apos;ll end up with another London.

Last time I checked, there was the Yonge line, the University line, and the Bloor line serving downtown. If that&apos;s not a subway system, then what is it...a peanut butter sandwich?



You have to travel 30 blocks north to Bloor before you can go east or west.


30 blocks from where...Buffalo? It&apos;s only 2kms from Queen to Bloor. Getting to the Bloor line is a quick and easy from anywhere downtown via the Yonge or University lines.

And traveling east or west south of Bloor is quite easy....you forget about our well-used LRT system...there are 5 streetcar lines running east-west and two lines running north-south also serving downtown.


Where are the subways along King, Queen, Dundas, College, Wellesley, Bathurst, Spadina, Sherbourne, and Parliament?


Sure...in my fantasy world there are subways running under every street too. Problem is, you have to wake up and face the real world. Snap out of it.

We don&apos;t really need subways running east-west south of Bloor...the LRT lines are much more appropriate for the travel patterns along those routes. Check a map...there aren&apos;t many people traveling long distances east or west south of Bloor, because Bloor is actually quite a bit south geographically.

The city needs more cross-town subway lines alright...but north of Bloor, not south of it. We do need a north-south downtown relief line east of Yonge mind you.


The platforms are puny, the halls too narrow, and the escalators insufficient.


Puny platforms? They are designed to move the entire contents of a 6-car T-1 train at 2 minute headways, which of course, they never need to do. During peak rush hour, there are a few major transfer stations that can get really crowded, especially if there is some kind of problem, but I have travelled on other subway systems, and Toronto really doesn&apos;t know what real nasty crowding is...yet anyway. For the majority of station platforms, they are more than adequate.

More escalators would be nice (or at least have pairs, rather than just one operating in the direction of rush hour traffic). But again, I have been on many subways that don&apos;t have escalatos or elevators period. Toronto doesn&apos;t run the only&quot;older&quot;subway system missing some of these things ya know.



The Jubilee Line subway extension in London cost $5.1 Billion for 11 miles of track in 1999. London is NOT a wealthier city than Toronto. The UK is NOT wealthier than Canada either. The British understand how important the success of London is not only to Londoners, but to all of Britain. Toronto, Ontario, and Canada need to wake up.


Get this through your head....Toronto is a revenue source...not a revenue benefactor. And the rest of the country is NEVER going to get moist over the idea of&quot;investing&quot;federal or provincial tax dollars in Toronto, no matter how&quot;important&quot;it is. So you might as well stop wasting brain cells over that one...that&apos;s just the way it is here.

Things are looking up though...the feds never invested tax dollars into public transit anywhere before, because it was never the job of the federal government...you seem to forget we live in the most highly decentralized country in the world...our federal government has a very small job...all the real work is done by the provinces. The fact that they are starting to actually hand money over for this kind of thing is new, and only do to the general public opinion about&quot;green&quot;policies, which transit falls into.

And Toronto is not London. You seem to forget that most transit riders on the TTC are&quot;choice&quot;riders. Unlike London, and many other major&quot;subway&quot;cities, Toronto is still a city where you can own and operate a car quite cheaply and efficiently. Doing this in New York, Tokyo or european cites is simply not economically or physically possible....transit is mandatory for almost everybody. Not to mention the average person who works in the core of Toronto can actually afford to live in the core if they choose as well, making long distance transit (or transit at all) not even necessary...try that in London...it&apos;s simply out of reach for the average person.




The reason that our downtown has developed north along Yonge rather than east and west along the lake is simple. Lack of transportation infrastructure:



I really don&apos;t see a problem with that at all...Toronto has been extremely good at TOD, and there is still plenty of room to densify at current subway stations. It&apos;s better to concentrate and keep things compact. We complain that&quot;other&quot;cities have built more miles of subway track, but the name of the game is not how much track you build, but how you use the track you have to be the most efficient...and Toronto does that very well. Bring people to the subway...not the subway to the people.

This compact, simple, frequent and efficient subway system we are complaining about, has actually given us an advantage in terms of our interesting and somewhat unique&quot;nodal&quot;development.

Don&apos;t get me wrong...I&apos;m not saying we shouldn&apos;t build more subways...I&apos;m definetely a huge fan of doing that (in the right places)....I&apos;m just saying it&apos;s better to build smaller subway lines with more people living/working on it, than it is to blow the bank building tons of subways that serve a more spread out population....it simply isn&apos;t very cost efficient.





KGB isaidso November 4th, 2007, 09:43 AM KGB:

Toronto&apos;s downtown stretches north from the lake to Bloor. Your defintion may go beyond that, but the central core is all south of Bloor. The Bloor-Danforth line is the northern boundary of this. Travelling north from Union station either up Yonge, or a few blocks to the west, up University doesn&apos;t change the fact that you can only travel in a north-south direction in the downtown. That is not a network by most people&apos;s defintion. A network implies interconnectivity or system. This doesn&apos;t meet even this very basic benchmark. We have a TTC system downtown, but we do not have a subway system downtown.

It doesn&apos;t qualify as a &apos;system&apos;. If you tried to tell anyone from any city with a real subway system that we have a subway system in our downtown, they would find the assertion a bit of a stretch. Our own TTC readily admit that we don&apos;t have a subway system downtown. I went to their public forum on the future of the TTC in the GTA. Judging by the applause in reaction to this statement, almost everyone in the audience seemed to be in agreement on this point.

My statement that you need to travel 30 blocks north before you can go east-west was an estimation. My apologies, it is closer to 25 blocks from Union to Bloor. I suppose I am used to Paris, London, and Montreal and am simply spoiled. Travelling 2 km to Bloor, as you suggest, may seem satisfactory to you, but when you&apos;re used to a subway station every 300 metres in a downtown, having to go 2 km is a big shock.

LRT? I don&apos;t expect to have to take LRT in a big city. It&apos;s one of those compromises you make when you move to a different place. Some things are better, some aren&apos;t acceptable to you because you are used to more. This is one of those cases. A streetcar instead of a subway is not a compromise I&apos;m used to having to make.

I&apos;ve resigned myself to the fact that subways are not a priority here like they are in other places in the world. Your reaction to my complaints is proof of that. I will simply have to grin and bear it.

Toronto is not a city for someone who loves subways, that&apos;s for sure. The idea that 4-5 subways south of Bloor is fantasy to people here is massive culture shock and a big eye opener. The mentality here certainly is different. We need them here, we need them north of Bloor also. The system is 1/5 the size it should be, but if Torontonians don&apos;t see that, I&apos;ll have to content myself with whizzing by them on my roller blades as they sit in traffic.

The platforms and stations are puny. During rush hour they are swamped. If Toronto&apos;s population was stagnant or falling it wouldn&apos;t be a huge issue. The fact that it is surging and people don&apos;t see any pressing problem is very worrying though.

Canada and Ontario need to wake up to the importance of an efficiently running Toronto. If they are so small minded and petty that they don&apos;t understand what is at stake for all Canadians, we are thicker than I thought. Bickering between the feds, the province, and municipalities has to stop. Perhaps, the younger generation will put an end to this madness. I&apos;m well aware of the fiscal realities of a federation. I am not interested in rehashing what I am already aware of, only in solutions to the mess.&quot;that&apos;s just the way it is here&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I found that statement the biggest let down of all. What a cop out. How are we ever going to progress with that attitude? It&apos;s like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Accepting the present situation is not going to solve the problems facing our city.

Toronto is not London. Quite right. But Toronto is heading in that direction whether we like it or not. We can either learn from their experience or bury our heads in the sand and think we&apos;re above it all. We are not. Almost every demographer, economist, and urban planner recognizes that Toronto needs to dramatically re-think how it views itself. The kind of city Toronto is, and has been, is rapidly coming to an end. We can recognize the sweeping changes that will occur, and prepare for it, or go into denial because we feel threatened by the changes taking place.

You may not agree, but I&apos;d rather listen to the academics, acknowledge the signs all around me which seem to back up their assertions, meet the challenges head on, and triumph over them. The do-nothing route of denial, excuses, and self-praise can only end badly. What is the worst that can happen if we manage to pressure Queen&apos;s Park and Ottawa to build subways on Queen and College?

I just don&apos;t know why you seem so hostile. We both live here. You can&apos;t improve on something unless you acknowledge what is lacking. Why not just build more subways?

I&apos;ll tell you why...I know the place very well...you clearly have no clue...you are one of those types who have moved here, haven&apos;t figured it out yet, and have decided that it all just sucks instead. There&apos;s really little point in discussing those issues with a person with your kind of attitude.

I don&apos;t have the time right now to adress every sentence in your last post, which is just too full of flaws, misconceptions and hyperbole. But let me give you one bit of advice...don&apos;t define Toronto by what it isn&apos;t..define it by what it is. Some of your basic flaws are not understanding the dynamics...we wouldn&apos;t follow what they are doing in London, because the basic physical layout, demographics, and most importantly...travel patterns are completely different.

Your assertions regarding streetcars are especially telling that you don&apos;t have the foggiest clue.

I am fully aware of what and where improvements are needed in terms of transit....certainly far more than you are, and with TTC staff in the family, far more in tune with what&apos;s going on. So maybe you should think long and hard about your position before writing everybody off who doesn&apos;t champion your ideas as just lacking vision, in denial, unaware or having our heads in the sand.

Yea...we both live here....only I&apos;m the one who actually seems to like it. Perhaps if you can&apos;t be patient enough to climatize to it, you should stop doing us all this big favour you seem to think you are doing us by tolerating and compromising yourself by glorifying us with your presence....and move to those cities that apparantly have perfect transit systems.

...rage for only Canadian cities and their....

(Canada might cover an immense are, but it sure ain&apos;t the rest of the world . . . ooooo, Canadians&apos;re so worldy.)

^^ My understanding is that Canada has yet to drum up mandating anything (errr, a pencil sharpener?) to do with public transport. I suggest you try living some place where its transport&apos;s always dealt with.

I&apos;d bet you&apos;re right. Its elevated, surface and underground networks were dilipidated up until just over three years ago, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised were its disintegration further progressed since.

^^ I&apos;m surprised too, I thought they&apos;d been monitoring their stations for ages now.

WTF is your problem? Electrify November 5th, 2007, 06:48 PM Isaidso, I will be the first to admit that from most of your posts, my viewpoint is nowhere near as left as yours, but I do agree that Toronto would have benefitied from another east-west line in the downtown.

I&apos;m not sure how familiar you are with Toronto&apos;s history, but we were to have an underground LRT (to later be converted to HRT) under Queen St, but it got pushed up to Bloor and forgotten about. In the 60s it was ressurected as part of Toronto&apos;s transportation strategy, which would have been a project of both rapid transit and highways and included the Queen line, but alas virtually nothing of this plan ever saw the light of day.

Even today I still believe a Queen line would have been more benificial than the Bloor. Yes, Bloor was seeing more growth and transit usage than Queen at the time, but on the overall city plan it just doesn&apos;t work. In the north, the city and suburbs grow out of Highway 11 (Yonge St), but in the east and west they grow out of Highway 2 (Lake Shore), and not off of Highway 5 (Bloor/Danforth). Today there is plenty of argument and demand to extend the Yonge line, but not so much the Bloor-Danforth. Not only is there more along Queen for the most part, but if it was built there would be more potential to extend it than where it is along B-D, since it is the main avenue for the eastern and western suburbs.

Finally, take a look at Toronto on Virtual Earth with a fast PC (http://local.live.com). You will see dozens of skyscrapers and high density along Yonge, but along the lake shore, Queen, or Bloor it doesn&apos;t come close to comparing. In fact, Queen today has similar density to Bloor, minus the subway. If a subway had been built, I&apos;m certain Queen would look like what Yonge does today with ultra high density development. noob(but not really) November 5th, 2007, 07:50 PM I&apos;m not sure how familiar you are with Toronto&apos;s history, but we were to have an underground LRT (to later be converted to HRT) under Queen St, but it got pushed up to Bloor and forgotten about.

Not only is there more along Queen for the most part, but if it was built there would be more potential to extend it than where it is along B-D, since it is the main avenue for the eastern and western suburbs.

Bloor was chosen due to the fact that east of Queen, only Kingston would feed into the line, while there were already several routes terminating at Luttrell Loop(near today&apos;s Main Street station), to feed into the streetcar. The suburbs were growing out of Danforth Road in the east, and traffic on Bloor-Danforth(both transit and cars) was increasing more rapidly. Queen in the east is also cut off by the lake, and Kingston Road provides the only alignment to extend the line. It was felt(and with good reason) that Kingston is too far south to adequately serve Scarborough with HRT, so for these reasons, Danforth was chosen.

The reason there is no talk of extending B-D right now is because the SRT is in the way, and they apparently decided to replace the current fleet. If it weren&apos;t for that, B-D would&apos;ve already been extended to STC and maybe even Malvern.

Queen obviously has similar density to Bloor. However, Bloor is much more developed than Queen at this point(a subway will change that). Yonge is the city&apos;s main street, so it shouldn&apos;t be surprising that it&apos;s the most developed. That does not negate what Bloor has accomplished, though. Historically, it is Queen that is Toronto&apos;s east-west main street, with Bloor second. However, development was moving north, and it covers more of the city and that&apos;s why it was selected for the east-west line. Kingston Road will soon be dense enough to support a busy LRT line, as well as Coxwell/O&apos;Connor, and the Beach LRT(see my post above). With these three lines feeding it from the east, there shouldn&apos;t be any problems this time around.

I&apos;ll even add a paragraph so you don&apos;t short circuit something you&apos;re in desperately short supply of: brain cells.

It&apos;s always a shock to leave the professional world around me and experience how thick other people really are. Then again, any 7 year old has internet access. Perhaps you are 7? Chat rooms allow exposure to the most pea-brained toxic people like yourself. I have no other option than to put you on IGNORE. If you don&apos;t understand what that means. It means that I won&apos;t have to suffer through your agonizingly stupid posts any longer. It&apos;s not my fault you feel so inadequate around me and need to resort to defensive mudslingling. Some people just aren&apos;t bright enough, educated enough, or refined enough for me to waste a nanosecond on. Back to the trailer park, mister.

Any messages you post, I won&apos;t see. You&apos;re more than welcome to respond, but you&apos;ll be talking to yourself. I bet you&apos;ll try though.


Why all that effort to make a point nobody, including yourself is going to buy? Get whatever you need to out of your system by all means...but try and be a little honest in the process. A: We all know I&apos;m not stupid, and B: You aren&apos;t putting me on ignore either. I can take insults, but isn&apos;t dishonesty beneath you?

I will assume that you make only sweeping generalizations about the TTC and Torontonians, and overly negative ones at that for two reasons...1: You lack indepth knowledge about the subject (where I will certainly outgun you), and 2: something has triggered an irrational response to the whole thing, which is why all we here from you is too much hyperbole, sky-is-falling remarks. Something is not right.

Now, there are very good arguements why subway lines under King, Queen, Dundas, College, and Wellesley would not be either a priority in terms of subway building, or even necessarilly beneficial or an improvement even if it were physically/financially feasable to do so.

And LRT in Toronto is not a compromise as you assert, but rather a required service that is specifically geared to providing that service, that neither buses nor subways could perform the same way.

Toronto has unique travel patterns, land use, geography, politics and demographics which make direct comparisons with other cities not very helpful in terms of assessing the specific transit needs of Toronto.

This can all be discussed in a mature and non-threatening manner....all you have to do is sign on.

Commission defends safety record despite eight robberies in two weeks on subway, including swarmings by groups of teens
5 November 2007
The Globe and Mail

A series of muggings at subway stations in recent weeks is not a sign that crime on the public transit system is getting out of control, Toronto Transit Commission officials say.

In the past two weeks, police have reported at least eight instances in which people were mugged, many of them swarmed by groups of teens at subway stations–or while riding subway trains–across the city.

TTC chairman Adam Giambrone acknowledged that the list of reported crimes–including an incident at Kennedy Station on Tuesday afternoon when four young men attacked two others over a cellphone–was longer than he would expect.

Two or three a week would not be unusual, he said.

“My understanding is that crime is not growing exponentially. But at the commission, we have various security issues,”Mr. Giambrone said, adding that he is notified of every incident.“Proportionately,”he said,“I believe crime is actually steady or falling on the system.”

While the TTC would not release figures for 2007, the crime rate on the transit system rose in 2006. The agency recorded 1,601 crimes of all descriptions against passengers in 2006, for a crime rate of 0.36 crimes per 100,000 riders, an increase from 0.29 in 2005 and 0.24 in 2004. The rates more than double when crimes against TTC staff are included.

An assault or other crime against a driver or a collector happens at least every other day, Mr. Giambrone said. Incidents range from a slap in the face to more serious attacks: In May, a TTC collector was stabbed at Lawrence Station and his booth set on fire.

However, the centre of the TTC&apos;s crime-fighting initiatives–plans to add 8,500 new surveillance cameras on vehicles and in subway stations–has run into controversy, and not just because of the $33.6-million cost, $6.4-million of which is being covered by Ottawa.

The province&apos;s Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner launched an investigation into the TTC&apos;s camera program after a complaint from the London-based advocacy group Privacy International.

The group argues that the TTC&apos;s plans are“disproportionate”and violate privacy laws, and that the transit agency has ignored studies suggesting the usefulness of cameras in fighting crime is“marginal.”

Toronto police, who have been experimenting with surveillance cameras in certain high-crime areas around the city, say that cameras are useful in investigations and that footage has helped lead to arrests in killings, sexual assaults, armed robberies and even the rescue of abducted children.

In April, TTC cameras recorded a stabbing at Kennedy subway station, and a 26-year-old man was arrested a few days later.

The cameras are not the only security measures the TTC is bringing in. In addition to being more mindful of safety concerns as it refurbishes or builds new subway stations, the transit agency is dramatically increasing its complement of special constables–who are unarmed but have police-like powers on TTC property.

The agency has added 22 in the past two years, bringing the force to 98, with plans–not yet approved by the city&apos;s number crunchers–to add another 20 in 2008.

Eventually, it hopes to have 174 special constables patrolling subway stations and bus and streetcar routes.

Not for the TTC. ;) But it is a component of the regional network. isaidso November 9th, 2007, 05:09 AM Isaidso, I will be the first to admit that from most of your posts, my viewpoint is nowhere near as left as yours, but I do agree that Toronto would have benefitied from another east-west line in the downtown.

I&apos;m not sure how familiar you are with Toronto&apos;s history, but we were to have an underground LRT (to later be converted to HRT) under Queen St, but it got pushed up to Bloor and forgotten about. In the 60s it was ressurected as part of Toronto&apos;s transportation strategy, which would have been a project of both rapid transit and highways and included the Queen line, but alas virtually nothing of this plan ever saw the light of day.

Even today I still believe a Queen line would have been more benificial than the Bloor. Yes, Bloor was seeing more growth and transit usage than Queen at the time, but on the overall city plan it just doesn&apos;t work. In the north, the city and suburbs grow out of Highway 11 (Yonge St), but in the east and west they grow out of Highway 2 (Lake Shore), and not off of Highway 5 (Bloor/Danforth). Today there is plenty of argument and demand to extend the Yonge line, but not so much the Bloor-Danforth. Not only is there more along Queen for the most part, but if it was built there would be more potential to extend it than where it is along B-D, since it is the main avenue for the eastern and western suburbs.

Finally, take a look at Toronto on Virtual Earth with a fast PC (http://local.live.com). You will see dozens of skyscrapers and high density along Yonge, but along the lake shore, Queen, or Bloor it doesn&apos;t come close to comparing. In fact, Queen today has similar density to Bloor, minus the subway. If a subway had been built, I&apos;m certain Queen would look like what Yonge does today with ultra high density development.

You&apos;ll get zero argument from me that the Queen line should have been built before the Bloor-Danforth line. Queen makes so much more sense. Do you know why Bloor was chosen instead?

If a line had been built along Queen, we would also have seen the CBD expand east and west rather than continuing to densify where the subway stations are. Our skyline would have stretched along the lake as Chicago&apos;s does. The skyline is starting to do this anyway despite a lack of subway here because the location is so compelling.

Of course there have been massive benefits to Bloor from the construction of a subway, but that could be said for any area where subways exist. We will eventually get an east west line on Queen. All the streetcars in the world are not going to be able to handle the volume we will be facing in 10-20 years. It&apos;s already bad. I already blade from Roncesvalles to Yonge if I am in a hurry. The streetcar is nice, but will not get me there on time.

It&apos;s interesting that I come off &apos;left&apos; to many people. Some of my politics is very very left (transit, civil liberties, minimum wage, environment, etc). In other areas such as the economy, taxes, and military I am very very right. I don&apos;t see most of these issues as left or right, just viewpoints that make the most sense. TRZ November 9th, 2007, 03:47 PM You&apos;ll get zero argument from me that the Queen line should have been built before the Bloor-Danforth line. Queen makes so much more sense. Do you know why Bloor was chosen instead?

I can tell you why Bloor was chosen instead - ridership figures and business case.

Just ignore n00b and his uninformed delusions, he does not know his history at all.

There was a long fight between the TTC and City Hall over the east-west arterial subway. The City had Queen at the center of its master plan, and was gung-ho about the subway running along Queen. The TTC was not interested due to the skyrocketing ridership figures along Bloor at the time and that the streetcar services along there then would not be able to keep up if it continues to grow at the rate that it was growing. The City tried to compromise with&quot;The Flying U&quot;, where the subway starts at Bloor on both east and west ends, but does a U-ey through the core via Queen. TTC still said no way, pointing to its ridership figures and current travel patterns, infrastructure capacity limits, etc., and I&apos;d imagine the Prince Edward Viaduct may have been part of their argument, they eventually convinced the city to do the Bloor-Uni subway (they were originally interlined so that downtown-bound commutes did not require a transfer, but this was discontinued half-a-year into service, leaving a white elephant in the famous ghost station known as Lower Bay).

As for the skyline spreading along the lake because of the compelling location, there is a reason it is compelling. The Harbourfront Car was the start of it, a new kind of streetcar line in the TTC&apos;s network, unique when first built in that it was segregated from traffic. The next new line followed suit, Spadina, which even interlines with the Harbourfront car&apos;s eastern half. St.Clair West is trying to repeat the same feat, although with great difficulty and is not yet finished. This two streetcar services on Spadina and Harbourfront provided very reliable, very local, and very attractive transportation in the entertainment and west downtown waterfront districts, which is one of the longest prime concentration points of condominium developments. This spilled onto King Street with its redevelopment from an industrial area to residential, which has seen its ridership on its streetcar route go through the roof to become the most heavily used in the network. Plans have been proposed (but not approved) for King to get dedicated lanes, and there&apos;s a good argument that it needs that a lot (even if not for the whole length of King propoer). Before that will happen, the West Waterfront LRT is likely to debut as the first product officiale of Transit City and provide even more juice to the downtown waterfront boom, with a possible revitalization in the Southern Parkdale area, and as east side waterfront development plans are being drawn up tailored around streetcar services (Cherry/West Don Lands, Queen&apos;s Quay East/East Bayfront). This is why the density is coming in like it is - brought to you by the magic of the streetcar, a compelling mode of transit. TRZ November 9th, 2007, 03:57 PM Transit City is garbage.:nuts:

This arrangement makes more efficient use of the existing University line and allows more of the city access to all of downtown, instead of just through Union. Speaking of Union, it would have a three platform configuration on both levels.

National Post

Jose Ongpin has a beef -- and it has to do with the goulash of Univers, Futura, Gill and Helvetica that typographically define Toronto&apos;s 68.3-kilometre, 69-station subway system.

&quot;There&apos;s a lack of consistency,&quot;he says.&quot;That&apos;s the problem the city needs to address, for the sake of commuters.&quot;

The amalgam of typefaces and tiles has grown over the years as new stations have opened. The designers of the various subway stops simply didn&apos;t pay heed to sticking to one font. The result, says Ongpin, as an OCAD student and a TTC rider, is that Toronto&apos;s underground system doesn&apos;t have a clear identity.

Ongpin decided to merge his passion for graphic design and public transit by creating a visual history of the subway&apos;s tiles and lettering.

To Ongpin, the typeface used in the original 12 stations, which opened in 1954, has a real flavour of the Toronto of that time:&quot;It has a kind of Art Deco look to it,&quot;he explains.&quot;At that time, every architect out there was thinking about modernism, simplicity, elegance -- and they were establishing an identity just like the Paris Metro or the London Underground.&quot;

The London system, he says, helped people to see the subway not only as a source of transportation but as a means of building the city&apos;s identity. It had real artistic direction, with a uniform set of fonts and tiles. By contrast, Toronto lost its way when it added new fonts (including the London Underground&apos;s Gill) as the system grew.

The original TTC typeface has since become something of a historical treasure -- but also a bit of a mystery. No one knows who created it. There is no copyright.

&quot;They somehow just designed it and used it in the subway but never thought it would be a popular typeface,&quot;Ongpin says.

Ongpin believes the TTC should adopt one font --and use it throughout the system. He looks to renovations, such as the one at the Bloor station, as redesigns that pay homage to the past, albeit in an updated form.&quot;They eliminated all the original architecture,&quot;he says,&quot;but they preserved that original typeface.&quot;

Moreover, he says, the city has squandered some opportunities to make more attractive stations.

&quot;Rosedale, actually, is one of the ugliest renovations I&apos;ve ever seen,&quot;he says of the station&apos;s mildew-coloured tiles.&quot;The original Rosedale was greenish, but light green, using Vitrolite tiles.&quot;Vitrolite was a glass-coated tile made during the &apos;40s and &apos;50s. And to add insult to injury, Rosedale replaced the original TTC font with Univers.

Interestingly, the original TTC font has made a comeback with its adoption in the new rapid transit stations in Scarborough.

While Ongpin concedes that fonts may not be the most important matter in public discourse, they are just one more small thing that hampers Toronto from having a strong identity.

&quot;As a tourist, you go to Toronto, and you see this special typeface that we have [at the Yonge station] and then you go to Dundas and say, &apos;What the heck is this?&apos;&quot; TRZ November 10th, 2007, 12:38 PM First Joe Clark (not the former PM, someone else), now this guy. These guys seriously make a mountain out of a mole. Jose Ongpin screams about inconsistency in fonts while Joe Clark screams about historical preservation of them. What neither realizes is, that although they themselves may consider this the most important thing since the nazis launched genocide against the jewish, most commuters don&apos;t even notice and really couldn&apos;t care less as long as these are clearly legible and don&apos;t look weird - something that inconsistencies won&apos;t cause.&quot;There&apos;s a lack of consistency,&quot;he says.&quot;That&apos;s the problem the city needs to address, for the sake of commuters.&quot;For the sake of commuters? Because you know a fraction of a percentage of these commuters can even tell the fonts apart, and far fewer would know the names of the fonts. These matter to you, not to commuters. They&apos;d much rather see changes they&apos;d notice, like improved visibility of signage in some cases.

The amalgam of typefaces and tiles has grown over the years as new stations have opened. The designers of the various subway stops simply didn&apos;t pay heed to sticking to one font. The result, says Ongpin, as an OCAD student and a TTC rider, is that Toronto&apos;s underground system doesn&apos;t have a clear identity. Designers pay heed to the station&apos;s relationship to its neighborhood, like they are supposed to do. The station&apos;s relationship to other stations hundreds of meters or a few kilometers away is not worth worrying about. Each station should look different because each neighborhood is unique, and stations should reflect this. Some examples of where this is done well include King (Hockey Hall of Fame references incorporated into design), Queen (Eaton Center references incorporated into design), and Rosedale (gentler, more nature-toned design scheme). The design is what should dictate the font. The system should not set one font for the whole system, except for standard signage (like, for example, exit signs, eastbound/westbound/northbound/southbound sings, other mass-produced elements), and of course, the TTC crest - the true icon of the system&apos;s identity. Fonts for station names arguably should be different for every station if the design makes that appropriate to reflect the serviced neighborhood of a station.

To Ongpin, the typeface used in the original 12 stations, which opened in 1954, has a real flavour of the Toronto of that time:&quot;It has a kind of Art Deco look to it,&quot;he explains.&quot;At that time, every architect out there was thinking about modernism, simplicity, elegance -- and they were establishing an identity just like the Paris Metro or the London Underground.&quot;

The London system, he says, helped people to see the subway not only as a source of transportation but as a means of building the city&apos;s identity. It had real artistic direction, with a uniform set of fonts and tiles. By contrast, Toronto lost its way when it added new fonts (including the London Underground&apos;s Gill) as the system grew. It&apos;s not the font. Some of the stations in London are indeed architectural treasures. I&apos;ve been through some of them like King&apos;s Cross. However, this has little to do with their font. Part of the identity of the Tube is actually in its rollingstock, and, much like the TTC, in its logo. Fonts establish an element of a style, true, but they do not, on their own, an identity make.

The original TTC typeface has since become something of a historical treasure -- but also a bit of a mystery. No one knows who created it. There is no copyright.

&quot;They somehow just designed it and used it in the subway but never thought it would be a popular typeface,&quot;Ongpin says.How times have changed indeed. Nobody goes to the trouble of creating a new typeface anymore, there are thousands to choose from now.

Ongpin believes the TTC should adopt one font --and use it throughout the system. No way, like aforementioned, the individual station&apos;s design (which should be somewhat dictated by the influences of its surroundings) dictates the font, not the system itself.



While Ongpin concedes that fonts may not be the most important matter in public discourse, they are just one more small thing that hampers Toronto from having a strong identity.

&quot;As a tourist, you go to Toronto, and you see this special typeface that we have [at the Yonge station] and then you go to Dundas and say, &apos;What the heck is this?&apos;&quot;

Hardly. Our identity is strong in the almighty crest and the mighty-yet-simplistic rolling stock. hkskyline November 10th, 2007, 05:35 PM Some history ...

Yea, while this is certainly not an&quot;issue&quot;, as issues go, there&apos;s something to be said for details. As long as we know the difference between the two.

I think the TTC really blew it by trashing the original Vitrolite stations and platforms. Toronto, as I beleive was the only city in the world designing and building subways directly following the war, had a unique post-war modernist design going on....a sort of utilitarian simplicity that had one foot in the waning deco period and one foot in the early modernist movement.

We are demolishing our early modernist heritage before we realize just how good it actually was....and in Toronto, that represents a fairly large chunk of our built heritage...we should start being far less cavelier about it (which I guess we have at least started to be thankfully).

I suppose it really isn&apos;t fair to characterize this as a quote from hkskyline, as he really just searches out articles on line that has some sort of negative slant towards Toronto...and then cut and paste it (for reasons I have yet to understand)....he really has little or no understanding of the topic, nor an understanding of what makes Toronto tic, or why things are the way they are, which is largely in part to history. He tends to characterize Toronto by what it isn&apos;t, rather than by what it is.




No way, like aforementioned, the individual station&apos;s design (which should be somewhat dictated by the influences of its surroundings) dictates the font, not the system itself.



I agree...while there should be some universal identifiers that lend some consistancy and image to the system, there&apos;s merit to stations having some relationship to the area they service. Speaking of which, I see there is something going on at Museum Station...is this the ROM-inspired reno we have seen in the past?




Hardly. Our identity is strong in the almighty crest and the mighty-yet-simplistic rolling stock.


Yea...to think tourists are actually going to make a note of typeface inconsistancies and even then, to characterize the system because of it. I think our unique streetcars and other TTC-specific things are what form image opinions. Even the&quot;Red Rocket&quot;and&quot;Ride the Rocket&quot;sayings have managed to stay quite of-the-moment, even though it has transfered from the original red Gloucster subway cars to the streetcars.

And yes, the TTC crest is indeed a great classic.

Well, we already know why the media resorts to sensationalism and negatives in its reporting...the question is, why do YOU cherry pick negative stories to support your long-standing and exclusively negative slant on the city, rather than presenting a more balanced and constructive arguement?

So can you point out some facts that they&apos;re reporting wrong? Is it positive from your mouth although it is negative from so many others? Or is it an illusion that the TTC is cash-strapped and can&apos;t improve its infrastructure to cope with population growth and the in-fill planning strategy?

Construction began on the Yonge subway in 1949 with a streetcar-subway station roughed in beneath Queen station on the Yonge line. After the Yonge subway opened in 1954, attention turned to the east-west line, but things had changed since 1946.

For one thing, streetcars had fallen out of favour as a rapid transit medium, and the City of Toronto’s plans for a Queen subway now called for heavy-rail equipment to be used. For another, the TTC was having second thoughts about locating the cross-town line along Queen.

Queen versus Bloor

Politically, the City of Toronto wanted a subway on Queen Street. Queen was the main east-west street running through the downtown, and on that basis the east-west subway had to go there. However, the TTC’s figures showed that ridership on the Bloor streetcar line was increasing rapidly, to almost 9000 passengers per direction per hour. Automobile traffic on Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue was increasing as well, pushing the multiple-unit PCCs to their limits, just as Yonge’s Witt trailer trains had been when the decision had been made to build the first subway beneath them.

The‘Flying-U’Proposal. (http://transit.toronto.on.ca/images/subway-5104-18.gif)

So, the TTC felt it had no choice but to build the cross-town subway along the Bloor-Danforth corridor. But this change in plan was controversial. The City of Toronto, backed by the towns of Long Branch, New Toronto and Mimico, continued to push for a Queen subway. At one point, the city proposed a‘flying U’compromise, running from Keele along Bloor, Grace, Queen, Pape, and Danforth Avenue to Woodbine. Dundas would have had four subway stops in total had this route been built, and the TTC were hard pressed to name them. From west to east, these stations would have been named‘Vincent’(now Dundas West), Bellwoods Park, Dundas and Dagmar.

Eventually the TTC proposal won out. Although I have not been able to find out how the TTC convinced the City of Toronto to accept its proposal, I speculate that the fact that the TTC was still financially independent helped. The Yonge subway had been built almost entirely from farebox revenues, and it looked as though the cross-town subway was going to be built from farebox revenues as well. Since the TTC did not require subsidy from Metropolitan Toronto, they may have been shielded from political pressure.




Actually, that&apos;s a very efficient use. A center platform for exiting, and the two side platforms for entering. Then two levels of course, for the two lines. There shouldn&apos;t have to be renovations after this arrangement is in place.

:lol: Do some research buddy, the TTC already looked into a platform on the north side of the north track at Union Station. Do you know what the north wall happens to be? THE FOUNDATIONS OF A SKYSCRAPER!:rofl: Good luck getting a platform there. There is a very good reason for the TTC putting a platform on the south end instead of the north (had the north been available, it might have been favourable over the south with more options available for improved access, but this is simply not realistic). As for the two levels, you&apos;d raise hell during construction. The current tracks would have to be completely removed and relaid after the lower level is made. You cannot simply go under the existing tracks as their foundations are not capable of acting as a span. You, of course, are incapable of considering these important details. The platform would also have a difficult time being kept open during construction, but they can do this in manageable chunks. Your Union Renovations proposal would require, at a bare minimum, running one-track service through Union Station for extended periods of time with reduced platform space to allow room for construction workers and reduced train serviced due to the one-track limitation - a completely unacceptable proposal as Union is already having such capacity issues today that the TTC is already installing a south platform.

You&apos;d actually have an easier time building directly under the historic Union Station.

Honestly, when you have ideas this absurd, I wonder why I should make the effort to keep this civil.

Perfect. You know what this means? We can still have the three platform configuration if we realign the tracks and expand southward. I know you&apos;ll start complaining about cost, but this will allow for a better turning radius on both sides. And don&apos;t even get me started on capacity. This is one of the busiest stations on the network, and it already can&apos;t handle just one narrow platform. Pretty soon it wouldn&apos;t be able to handle a second one either. The current renovations are only a band-aid solution.

The two levels of course, are necessary because this will be the future interchange with DRL. Why splitting up the lines? So that commuters from either Don Mills or Weston can access downtown easier(especially the northern part) instead of getting dropped off at Union and being forced to walk a long ways to their destination. This arrangement also uses University a lot better. Yonge was pretty much extended haphazardly, and because of this, you get the odd phenomenon of empty seats downtown as you make the loop. This will put an end to that. hkskyline November 13th, 2007, 07:09 AM Being a follower of TTC news regularly, it&apos;s very obvious that the general trend of coverage is negative, and there are plenty of concrete reasons behind it, which leads to the big picture over how government is involved in investing in cities across the country.

I&apos;m highly critical of how the TTC is run. I don&apos;t have that much positive to say about them at all. While I constantly hear arguments that the TTC is the most self-sufficient system on the continent and all that, making it seem like a good thing, the fact is it&apos;s not. Being self-sufficient is not the same as providing good service. We need to be clear on what the TTC&apos;s objective and mandate should be. AmiDelf November 13th, 2007, 08:57 AM Some history ...

Oslo wagons were built from 1960s to 1980s. Is Toronto inspired by Oslo design or the other way? In Oslo wagons you can also look at the track ahead of you, while the cabin is on the right side.

Also, the pre-metro wagons was all red also, before they choose this design. TRZ November 13th, 2007, 01:38 PM I didn&apos;t say he&apos;s not serious, he just doesn&apos;t like my posts, and thus doesn&apos;t want a serious discussion with me.
If I liked your posts (implying rather&quot;If I didn&apos;t disagree with noob&quot;), then there&apos;d be no debate. Disagreeing with you has nothing to do with not being serious. It&apos;d be far easier to have a serious discussion with you if the contents of your posts weren&apos;t so absurd.





LMAO. I know about Lower Queen and that Flying U crap.:lol: The man who wants the Queen Subway so bad refers to the Flying U as&quot;crap&quot;, when it would have run along Queen :nuts:. OK, so you don&apos;t support a Queen Subway? The Flying U wasn&apos;t that bad of an idea - as Jaye on here has pointed out before, and I think he has a point on this, is that if the Flying U had been built, we wouldn&apos;t have the over-capacity issues at Yonge/Bloor and south of Bloor on Yonge. This is hard to argue against, and gives added truth to the old saying of hindsight is 20/20, the Flying U may have actually been smarter in the end, if only we had a crystal ball in the late 1950s. I think the Flying U might have faced some potential alignment difficulties, but then again, the city worked in a completely different manner back in those days, where tough decisions were actually made by politicians, unlike these days where all politicians suck out and look for the easy [cheap, low-risk, poor-on-return] way.

You are also oblivious to the fact that I covered the most noteworthy of those issues in my post. But I decided not to quote Transit Toronto verbatim. :tongue2:
:nono: Transit Toronto is a respectable source, as are the additional hardcover references I also pointed to. You, on the other hand, are far from a reliable source.

As for your issues being&quot;noteworthy&quot;, puh-leeze.:| Don&apos;t take my word for it though, take a look for yourself in a proper comparison and you&apos;ll see the error of your ways: :lol:

Bloor was chosen due to the fact that east of Queen, only Kingston would feed into the line, while there were already several routes terminating at Luttrell Loop(near today&apos;s Main Street station), to feed into the streetcar.

Queen in the east is also cut off by the lake, and Kingston Road provides the only alignment to extend the line.

VS.

TTC’s figures showed that ridership on the Bloor streetcar line was increasing rapidly, to almost 9000 passengers per direction per hour, pushing the multiple-unit PCCs to their limits, just as Yonge’s Witt trailer trains had been when the decision had been made to build the first subway beneath them.

It is obvious that the need to maintain current service at an acceptable and attractive level and provide adequate supply to meet the crushing demand is a far higher priority than looking at potential extensions. To suggest otherwise, as you did try to argue that potential extensions was a major reason, is simply crazy talk. The limited options for extensions had squat to do with the decision, the most important reason was the PCCs being unable to meet the current demand in the very-near future at the time - Bloor had already turned into a Yonge was the reality of the day. Queen hadn&apos;t turned into Yonge, still hasn&apos;t, and perhaps never will (King on the other hand, is already just about there).

Thus, you did not state the most noteworthy reason, not by a long shot.

The reason there is no talk of extending B-D right now is because the SRT is in the way, and they apparently decided to replace the current fleet. If it weren&apos;t for that, B-D would&apos;ve already been extended to STC and maybe even Malvern.We&apos;ve been over the physical impossibility of this one already. The SRT is not&quot;in the way&quot;as the current Kennedy Subway Station cannot turn onto the SRT&apos;s alignment, nor would it be able to turn at the Ellesmere/Midland area.






Perfect. You know what this means? We can still have the three platform configuration if we realign the tracks and expand southward. I know you&apos;ll start complaining about cost, but this will allow for a better turning radius on both sides.The change in turning radius would be negligible, you don&apos;t understand how slight such a realignment actually is and does not address the issues with the curve between King and Union.&quot;Perfect&quot;is hardly the word I&apos;d use.

So that commuters from either Don Mills or Weston can access downtown easier(especially the northern part) instead of getting dropped off at Union and being forced to walk a long ways to their destination. This arrangement also uses University a lot better.

Well, it might be a band-aid 20-years from now, I can agree with that. However, if you wanted to make a Wye interchange and remove the problems of the curve, and imporve connectivity with Union Station in general, why not go all out, especially if you are not concerned about cost? Frankly, your proposal would cause so much disruption that building a new alignment could actually be cheaper and easier since the complications of keeping service running during construction would be virtually a non-issue - and that&apos;s enormous savings in time, project management details, construction phases, co-ordination, among other things. Service would be disrupted for a weekend or two, and that&apos;s about it (to install new junctions).

To Illustrate:

http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w203/TrainX/UnionReA.jpg

The Yellow Line is obviously the current alignment. The Purple branches are your DRL. The Green outlines are rough outlines of the new Stations - East Teamway (Union Station East Exit) and West Teamway (Union Station West Exit). The brackets are displaying text in the same style as&quot;Yorkville&quot;appears under Bay (so if I were describing Bay here I would type it as&quot;Bay (Yorkville)&quot;). The West Teamway Station is two levels segregated by direction. The East Teamway Station is most likely two islands, not sure if it should be segregated by Line or Direction though (I&apos;d prefer by Direction). The U around the ACC is where the Wye would be. The light blue line is LRT - the one on Bay Street by East Teamway is existing. The West Teamway one is a possible alignment the WWLRT would be using (maybe, this is of course not yet known). The dark yellow station along the Yellow Line is of course the existing Union Station. This space, I propose, be converted into a small yard for the downtown. Since downtown has seen a residential explosion, there is now a good argument to have a yard in the core, and this is a very recent development. The original Yonge Line terminated at Eglinton, so it is no surprise that the yard was put towards the northmost end of the line, since peak travel times would make that the best place to put it - same for Wilson, Greenwood, and Keele area yards. With downtown now not only a place to work but to live as well, a yard in the core makes sense.

The two new stations will also provide way better GO Train connections as platform access can be obtained directly from the fare gates. East Teamway would also result in an exceptionally convenient Subway Connection for the GO Bus terminal.

It also gets rid of the King Curve.

It also provides a solution to the possible capacity conflicts with the existing Union Station LRT station when WWLRT opens. The two lines would still connect at Queen&apos;s Quay and Bay, so the two lines serving two different subway stations would not result in a loss of connection between the two lines themselves.

Given that this also provides even more capacity than you had originally proposed noob, I think you&apos;d agree with something like this.

This is a prime solution for Union Station, but extremely expensive (but whether or not it is as expensive as noob&apos;s proposal is debatable).


Yonge was pretty much extended haphazardly, and because of this, you get the odd phenomenon of empty seats downtown as you make the loop. This will put an end to that.

The WWLRT, I thought was supposed to continue through the ACC to Bay St. and then turn up into Union Station. I&apos;ve wondered if they could possibly add a station at Lake Shore to serve both the ACC and the new condos in the area. There&apos;s been some discussion as to where the line would go underground.

A relocated Union Station with a rough-in for a DRL station would also require a new, hopefully larger streetcar station to serve the various routes which will eventually run into Union once all the waterfront development has happened.

I&apos;ve considered a DRL as well with a tie-in with Union. One option, which would be less than ideal but still offer transfers is to run it parallel to the Yonge-University line and have the transfer through the mezzanine level. (Similar to the Berri-UQAM station in Montral or a bit like the Spadina stations.) It&apos;d mean that they wouldn&apos;t have to support the Y-U Union while they dig the DRL Union. Tie it all in with whatever Union train and streetcar station redevelopment plans that eventually make it to reality. This way the DRL can run under the rail corridor/Esplanade.

I can imagine that this would be expensive and yet, I just think that it would be worth it if it just makes the turn quieter.

besides, Lower Toronto (ie. south of Front Street) is getting busier and busier. This would be an interesting solution.

Cheers, m TRZ November 14th, 2007, 12:20 PM The WWLRT, I thought was supposed to continue through the ACC to Bay St. and then turn up into Union Station. I&apos;ve wondered if they could possibly add a station at Lake Shore to serve both the ACC and the new condos in the area. There&apos;s been some discussion as to where the line would go underground.Yes, you are correct, the discussions are still going and no final decision is yet made (AFAIK). An EA is currently in progress for Bremner which includes investigations for a new portal, and before it is finished, no final decisions will be made as I understand it. While it is true that running it up Bay into the current loop is what they want, there is an awareness at the TTC already that this will put too much strain on the current loop at Union and something needs to be done to expand capacity, not easy with an underground station like this one.

One of the other LRT projects in the works though, is the Queen&apos;s Quay East-Cherry St route, which I am running with as an extension of the WWLRT (eventually dropping the&quot;West&quot;from its name and just making it the Waterfront LRT), but this is a presumption on my part in the above schema. For that through service, I am running it down York to allow it to serve (close to) Harbourfront in addition to the ACC and the new subway station in the schema.

A relocated Union Station with a rough-in for a DRL station would also require a new, hopefully larger streetcar station to serve the various routes which will eventually run into Union once all the waterfront development has happened.I believe we are thinking alike here. I am proposing with the above the 509 (plus occasional 510) continue to use their current loop, while the WWLRT and Cherry routes use the new loop by West Teamway. This way the old loop can continue to function in its current state, although a new platform will probably be recommended to extend to the new station as it is on the opposite side of the loop from the current station. The existing platform need not be discontinued though (necessarily, it needs to be conceded that it would not be conveniently located relative to the new station at East Teamway).

I&apos;ve considered a DRL as well with a tie-in with Union. One option, which would be less than ideal but still offer transfers is to run it parallel to the Yonge-University line and have the transfer through the mezzanine level. (Similar to the Berri-UQAM station in Montral or a bit like the Spadina stations.) It&apos;d mean that they wouldn&apos;t have to support the Y-U Union while they dig the DRL Union. Tie it all in with whatever Union train and streetcar station redevelopment plans that eventually make it to reality. This way the DRL can run under the rail corridor/Esplanade.

You mean run parallel on the south side of the existing subway station? That might be too tight a fit. I strongly suspect you&apos;d encounter interference with the foundations of Historical Union Station (specifically, the foundations of the Great Hall). The new platform being added to the existing station is going to at least come up to the moat&apos;s north edge, if not protrude under the moat already, and there is no way to fit both two tracks and a new platform within the width of the moat (the moat&apos;s foundations are workable, as the main concern here are the retaining walls). Dealing with a Heritage Structure, there&apos;s gonna be a lot of opposition to something that could potentially threaten its foundation supports (lord forbid there were ever an accident in that scenario). TRZ November 14th, 2007, 12:32 PM Interesting ideas, TRZ...

would there be room for a TTC yard in the area tho, with the current GO yard to the west and the future GO yard to the east?
Thanks :) The yard would be small, but the space for such I believe is there. The GO yards would not conflict since the existing Union Station is where the new yard would go. This allows the existing to track to remain in use for non-revenue purposes after the new south-side swing is in service. Using the two existing tracks, you should be able to squeeze in 4 trains. Take out the island platform to squeeze in at least 1 more train. Take out the new platform being built and run a new track there and store another 2 trains. If there is room, which is unclear, add one more track, which would bring it right up to the foundations of Heritage Union Station (but not modify or otherwise disturb the foundations), which would allow 1 more train. So you should be able to store 8 trains in this little yard. Keele&apos;s yard is also about this size, though certainly not as cramped as this one would be. This yard would be for marshalling only, no vehicle maintenance could occur here. I believe Keele is the same story, as is GO Bathurst Yard (as Willowbrook is where vehicle maintenance occurs)

I can imagine that this would be expensive and yet, I just think that it would be worth it if it just makes the turn quieter.

besides, Lower Toronto (ie. south of Front Street) is getting busier and busier. This would be an interesting solution.

Wasn&apos;t one of GO&apos;s proposals for Union Station if they had their way to excavate their concourse to give it some more headroom? How would lowering the concourse to the TTC&apos;s level affect the foundations? Assuming they got the approval, how low can they go without drastically affecting the foundations of the Great Hall and the rest of the building?

Given the amount of stuff the DRL would have to go around (sewage, hydro, the LRT lines), would it be possible to build the station deep enough say at or below the old lake bed that was filled in? Given the complexities of trying to thread another line downtown there aren&apos;t much options other than to dig deep or go above ground. noob(but not really) November 14th, 2007, 09:40 PM TRZ, you selectively quoted me to back up your allegations. Here&apos;s where I covered that most noteworthy issue:

Bloor was chosen due to the fact that east of Queen, only Kingston would feed into the line, while there were already several routes terminating at Luttrell Loop(near today&apos;s Main Street station), to feed into the streetcar. The suburbs were growing out of Danforth Road in the east, and traffic on Bloor-Danforth(both transit and cars) was increasing more rapidly. Queen in the east is also cut off by the lake, and Kingston Road provides the only alignment to extend the line. It was felt(and with good reason) that Kingston is too far south to adequately serve Scarborough with HRT, so for these reasons, Danforth was chosen.

Of course, I didn&apos;t provide statistics, but I did cover it to some degree. BTW, I&apos;ve read that article on TT several times.



We&apos;ve been over the physical impossibility of this one already. The SRT is not&quot;in the way&quot;as the current Kennedy Subway Station cannot turn onto the SRT&apos;s alignment, nor would it be able to turn at the Ellesmere/Midland area.

You proposed a way that this can be done though.



The change in turning radius would be negligible, you don&apos;t understand how slight such a realignment actually is and does not address the issues with the curve between King and Union.&quot;Perfect&quot;is hardly the word I&apos;d use.

It would still affect it to a noticeable degree.


As for that Union proposal you posted, I am speechless. That would definitely be an improvement. However, my preferred alignment for DRL is incorrect. I&apos;d have it come in from the west along the rail corridor(sloping downwards from the viaduct west of Jarvis to dip underground), then continue along Front Street.



??? What are you talking about?

You know when you get past King, everyone has gotten off, then the subway is empty as you go around the loop, then takes a while to fill up again? This is an inefficiency in the system. If the lines are split at Union(either the current one, or your proposal), then both University and Yonge will be used to their full potential. TRZ November 15th, 2007, 11:58 AM Wasn&apos;t one of GO&apos;s proposals for Union Station if they had their way to excavate their concourse to give it some more headroom? How would lowering the concourse to the TTC&apos;s level affect the foundations? Assuming they got the approval, how low can they go without drastically affecting the foundations of the Great Hall and the rest of the building?Modifying floor levels within the foundations (i.e. within the building footprint) can be done without modifying the foundation walls or footings themselves, this is quite safe to the structure so long as you are not going to or below the footings. Also, small openings (such as those used for pedestrian traffic) can be made in the foundation walls to allow travel perpendicular to the axis that the foundation wall runs along and still be structurally sound with some reinforcement at jambs and lintels.
Union Station&apos;s foundations are actually quite deep, as there&apos;s a basement level that is not widely known, and apparently there&apos;s a generating station within said basement.
While small openings can be made in a foundation wall, a subway along the same axis as the foundation wall is pretty much impossible.
Going under the footings is also not recommended. Not only would it be a very deep station to do so, but it is complicated and risky redesigning the load-transfer system of Union Station&apos;s structure, unless you go to unreasonable depths to avoid that being necessary. I&apos;d argue it is not worth it.
As for going in on one end of the building footprint and out the other, also no good since you&apos;d encounter column footings to navigate around as well.

EDIT: Or, if not columns, stairwell foundations

Given the amount of stuff the DRL would have to go around (sewage, hydro, the LRT lines), would it be possible to build the station deep enough say at or below the old lake bed that was filled in? Given the complexities of trying to thread another line downtown there aren&apos;t much options other than to dig deep or go above ground.

Sewers and hydro and gas lines can be relocated. This is not uncommon for subways. As for the LRT, the current subway&apos;s current depth is already almost low enough to go under anyway, another meter deeper and it&apos;ll probably be able to clear it. Going below the old lake bed should not be a requirement. The best option, I&apos;d argue, is to go under existing streets and parking lots (while they&apos;re still there), where foundations of buildings are not going to be a problem - anything underneath those can be worked with, somehow.

We&apos;ve been over the physical impossibility of this one already. The SRT is not&quot;in the way&quot;as the current Kennedy Subway Station cannot turn onto the SRT&apos;s alignment, nor would it be able to turn at the Ellesmere/Midland area.You proposed a way that this can be done though.
No, I did not propose a way that the CURRENT Kennedy Station can turn into the SRT&apos;s alignment, there is no way, to do it would require a new Kennedy Station to be built, but that is not practical at all unless an Eglinton Line is available to take over the existing B-D station.

Shopping mall proposed for under train tracks
15 November 2007
National Post

Standing on the cracked marble in the soaring great hall of Union Station yesterday, Mayor David Miller announced a grand plan to transform the station by excavating a shopping mall underneath the train tracks, to be operated by a private real estate company the city has not yet found.

The City of Toronto, which has owned Union Station since 2000, also wants to turn over all the station&apos;s office and retail space to a private operator, and use the proceeds to fix up the 80-year-old landmark.

&quot;This is the most important transportation hub in Canada,&quot;the Mayor said.&quot;Unfortunately, Union Station economically is not sustainable. Now we have a made-in-Toronto approach to revitalizing Union Station.&quot;

Close to 200,000 commuters use the station every day, most of them GO train passengers.

The city wants to put the underground mall south of the station, connecting it to the condominium community now growing around the Air Canada Centre.

J.C. Williams, a retail consultant hired by the city, calculates that the retail will generate enough rent to keep the train station in good repair, said George Wheeler, project director of the Union Station Revitalization.

However, he also confirmed that a sewer the Toronto Transit Commission is rerouting under Front Street -- which has left much of the station&apos;s plaza torn up all year -- will have to moved again to make the new scheme work.

Toronto has $85-million in its capital budget to fix Union Station over the next five years. The city says truly restoring the station will cost $176-million over 20 years.

That total does not include the cost of the massive excavation project. Yesterday, no one at the city would put a price on building the underground mall or say how long that job would take.

The city also doesn&apos;t know who would run the mall; city staff have talked with a few big pension funds.

&quot;We want to deal with the top tier, the companies with billions of dollars in assets,&quot;said Jodie Parmar, the city&apos;s director of business and strategic innovation.

The plan involves lowering the floor of the station&apos;s east and west concourses, putting them at the same level as the subway station under Front Street. To the south of the concourse, the new mall would spread under the stairs that now lead up to the trains.

Union Station is also becoming a node of the city&apos;s underground PATH network, linking the business district to condos and offices south of Front Street.

The station has huge untapped potential. For example, on the station&apos;s west wing are 135,000 square feet of office space on four floors, now vacant. Mr. Parmar said they would make a perfect head office for GO Transit, the station&apos;s main user; the words&quot;Railway Offices&quot;are cut into the limestone above the entrance. But he said GO so far has not expressed interest.

Already, the city has begun the repair job. In the past week, workers put back the hands on the west face of the clock that stands in the station&apos;s centre. The Post had published a picture of the broken clock two weeks ago.

&quot;Apparently, city staff read the National Post,&quot;Mr. Miller said.

Yesterday, train buffs, Via Rail employees and commuters crowded around as the Mayor made his announcement, and stuck around to listen and comment and study a series of boards set up with drawings of the plans. The city invites the public to comment by e-mailing union_station@toronto.ca. Tony Turritin of Transport 2000 said he loves the new plan.&quot;It keeps the elegance of the heritage building and at the same time increases the functionality for GO Transit,&quot;he said.

But Catherine Naismith, a heritage building advocate, worried about the logistics of the job. Anybody who has ever lowered their basement knows how complicated excavation can be under existing structures.

&quot;It&apos;s very expensive space to create because there is a huge amount of underpinning to do,&quot;she said.&quot;I mean, you&apos;ve got trains overhead.&quot;

And she asked,&quot;Why are they sending everybody underground? You should be able to flow through these grand public spaces.&quot;

Frank Consiglio, who works at customer service for Via Rail, added that,&quot;retail has taken a priority over transportation.&quot; noob(but not really) November 15th, 2007, 10:37 PM You did not cover the most noteworthy issue. You sited traffic, not ridership, and that is the big difference. Traffic added insult to injury, true, but the main reason was the fact that the multi-unit PCCs would simply be unable to cope with the demand, far more serious than just&quot;an increase in traffic&quot;, and you did not identify this issue. You did not identify the fact that Bloor had more or less turned into a Yonge, and this is the most noteworthy issue, which you completely missed.

I did cover ridership under traffic - they needed to increase headways to 45 secs, so that would be streetcar traffic.

Of course Eglinton would interchange here, so the current station would still be used either way. As for Ellesmere, I said a new curve would be built. It would curve under the Ellesmere/Midland intersection, with a new station there.

Yeah it&apos;s really a great idea. I think it&apos;s your best so far. That area is growing like crazy, and Union is just going to keep handling more and more passengers. Something like this would be a good permanent fix.

If so I hope they do something to reduce noise and vibration....

Wiring System
In trains, stations or both? TTC chairman asks
14 November 2007
National Post

The TTC is exploring wiring its subways for cellphone use.

The idea emerged yesterday as the commission updated reporters on a five-year plan to install customer-service technology that is already standard in major public transit systems around the world.

Councillor Adam Giambrone, chairman of the TTC, said commission staff is working on a report for early next year looking at whether and how the public transit authority could take the cellphone network underground.

The TTC would have to consult the public before going ahead, he said, because while the idea might thrill cellphone addicts, it risks disturbing subway riders seeking a quiet trip.

&quot;The question will be, of course, when we say rolling [cellphone use] out in the subways, what do we mean?&quot;Mr. Giambrone said.&quot;That&apos;s why we have to look at it. Do we mean on the trains or in the stations?…The question is do you want to sit next to somebody talking on their cellphone?&quot;

New York City recently decided to wire its 277 underground subway stations -- but not its trains or tunnels -- for cellphone use.

It contracted a third-party company to build and pay for the system. The company, Transit Wireless, will charge cellphone carriers a fee to use its signal.

Gary Webster, the TTC&apos;s chief general manager, said Toronto&apos;s transit authority would also look to a private company, possibly a cellphone carrier, to foot the bill for installing underground cellphone service here.

The cellphone idea, however, is a long way off when compared to some of the high-tech projects the commission touted yesterday.

Beginning on Monday, the TTC will post service interruption alerts on the electronic screens on its subway platforms and on its Web site.

Once that $1.1-million project is evaluated, the transit authority will explore sending such alerts to cellphones and BlackBerrys.

The TTC plans to spend $5.5-milion installing electronic signs and back-up equipment to tell bus and subway passengers when the next vehicle will arrive.

The commission will begin testing the idea on subway platforms -- using existing electronic screens --next summer. A bus and streetcar pilot project is expected to launch in November, 2008, the commission said.

The TTC will unveil a $375,000 makeover to its 10-year-old Web site in the spring, but transit riders will still have to wait until July, 2009, to plot their transit trips over the Internet and buy all their transit passes online.

Those two projects will cost a combined $3.5-million.

Mr. Giambrone conceded that the TTC is behind the times when it comes to offering basic services like an Internet trip planner, which would allow customers to plug locations into the TTC&apos;s Web site and learn the best combination of bus, streetcar and subway routes to get to their destinations.

&quot;Clearly this is something we should have done in the past,&quot;Mr. Giambrone said of the trip planner.&quot;There&apos;s really no excuse for that. The commission directed this last year and now, I think if you talk to other transit authorities that have rolled out trip planners, it is a two-year process.&quot; TRZ November 17th, 2007, 10:57 AM I did cover ridership under traffic - they needed to increase headways to 45 secs, so that would be streetcar traffic.You did not specifically refer to ridership in the orginal post, and that is exactly my point. You are focusing entirely on vehicular traffic, not ridership. If 45 second headways can satisfy the demand, then there&apos;s not as much of a problem, but even at that, the demand was projected to overpower that arrangement in the near-future if the growth pattern observed for the last while were to continue, which indicators would support would happen.





Of course Eglinton would interchange here, so the current station would still be used either way.No, you said that the only reason B-D has not been extended is because the SRT is in the way, you did not cite the missing existence of an Eglinton Subway line to take over the existing station.
As for Ellesmere, I said a new curve would be built. It would curve under the Ellesmere/Midland intersection, with a new station there.Except you can&apos;t curve under the intersection like that. Too much expropriation. There is a way to do it without expropriating, however you think expropriation is simple and popular.:ohno:

Ok, but how silly is it to have that loop. Hardly anyone uses it, and the phenomenon I described does happen quite a bit.
Well, it is designed to serve a specific purpose, and it still is a much needed purpose today - alleviating Yonge south of Bloor. That&apos;s its principal function. The phenomenon you cite is not really a&quot;problem&quot;. It is not designed to act as a loop and doesn&apos;t need to have people ride continuously through the loop. This is not a loop line - what I&apos;ve propsed elsewhere is a loop line . :) TRZ November 17th, 2007, 11:12 AM Would the DRL be located above/below the Yonge line in the same structural arrangement that gave us St. George and Bay?No. I&apos;ve been thinking about how to do the East Teamway layout. It is an interesting location and position with a lot of popular potential in various directions from the platform. As such, a very unconventional staggered/split-level arrangement of platforms and tracks is what I would propose for the East Teamways station. It is hard to describe and I may provide a sketch. This would provide good noise control and vibration isolation design opportunities.

However, after reading up on some of the Union Redevelopment proposals, I am having second thoughts about the naming, and just leaving it as Union for East Teamways Station (as it shares the existing LRT loop anyway, combined with the GO Bus terminal, it is much more appropriate this way), and making the West Teamways Station to&quot;York (Bremner)&quot;instead. This is more conventional and what the system is used to. Uni-Spadina would become the York Line :lol: (York(Bremner) to York Uni)

If so I hope they do something to reduce noise and vibration....

actually, I wish they could do that for St. George (and Bay) as well.

I suppose that if the TTC really wanted to do it, they could...but it would mean a serious disruption of St. George for many weeks or months at a time....

Cheers, m

Actually, the amount of isolators in question that would be required might not be practical since they could theorhetically require a change in track levels. I cannot think of a way they could do it without shutting the service down for a while. noob(but not really) November 18th, 2007, 01:18 AM You did not specifically refer to ridership in the orginal post, and that is exactly my point.

I just wanted to point out that both vehicular AND streetcar traffic was increasing, and ridership would be included in the latter. We both know this, so there&apos;s no point in arguing.



No, you said that the only reason B-D has not been extended is because the SRT is in the way, you did not cite the missing existence of an Eglinton Subway line to take over the existing station.

If there was no SRT, they would extend it in no time.



Except you can&apos;t curve under the intersection like that. Too much expropriation. There is a way to do it without expropriating, however you think expropriation is simple and popular.:ohno:

Opposition to this type of expropriation is nothing short of NIMBYism. But do tell us, what is this&quot;way to do it w/o expropriation&quot;?

Wait, it&apos;s needed because people riding Yonge south need to take University to relieve Yonge? :nuts:

I know what you mean, but my plan won&apos;t change its function as a relief line. Rather, it would solidify it, because it would also relieve Yonge to the east. Yonge would also be full coming into Union, instead of empty. So it&apos;s a better use of the system. TRZ November 18th, 2007, 05:05 AM I just wanted to point out that both vehicular AND streetcar traffic was increasing, and ridership would be included in the latter.

Vehiclar volume does give a measure of capacity supplied, but it does not give a measure of capacity demanded, and that is why yours was an erroneous and ill-informed statement. Capacity demanded can only be conveyed by ridership figures, not vehicluar headways. If you fail to understand this, that&apos;s your handicap.





If there was no SRT, they would extend it in no time.
No, if there was no SRT, it&apos;d be a streetcar line like originally planned - that&apos;s why the loop is useless for the SRT, it was designed for a streetcar&apos;s turning radius.

Ok, I&apos;m glad you understand. Think about the setup... you have Yonge in the middle, with relief on either side(University-Spadina, Don Mills), then a western spur of Yonge going to Weston, sort of acting as additional relief for U-S.

U-S doesn&apos;t need a relief line, it already is a relief line in and of itself.

You&apos;re the same noob that said if there was no SRT that a B-D extension to STC would have materialized, aren&apos;t you?

Pretty much. A streetcar line would&apos;ve been easier to replace, as it wouldn&apos;t have cost as much. And it&apos;s undeniable that more capacity is needed.



If there&apos;s a bus terminal, yeah, absolutely, but what station are you referring to? The alignment stays clear of subdivisions of detatched houses in general.

I mean density.



You were referring to the east, I know, and University was designed to take people from the east as well - it&apos;s called Lower Bay.

Didn&apos;t bring Lower Bay into this, I was saying that as you get past King, the subway is empty, then it takes almost the entire length of University, if ever, to fill up. This is worse during off peak times. If U-S became part of a different line(instead of an awkward appendage), then this would cease.



U-S doesn&apos;t need a relief line, it already is a relief line in and of itself. That doesn&apos;t mean that more subway lines are bad, per se, but priorities must be set accordingly considering funding.

Wow, you are so nitpicky! Obviously it won&apos;t be a relief line, but it is an alternate route downtown, so I could see that some ppl would take it, and thus it could be a relief line.

Electrify wasn&apos;t the one who asked the question. The person who asked&apos;s opinion is irrelevant anyway, because they don&apos;t know, the opinion on the quality of your response of people that are familiar with the facts in detail do matter. If you&apos;re not clear and precise, why should you be taken seriously? The fact remains is that you mentioned everything but ridership specifically.





Pretty much. A streetcar line would&apos;ve been easier to replace, as it wouldn&apos;t have cost as much. And it&apos;s undeniable that more capacity is needed.Whether it is a streetcar line or an ICTS being replaced, a subway replacing either is going to be the same cost since the same alignment can&apos;t be used regardless. The streetcar line would not be having this problem in the first place though, as LRT has a considerably higher capacity than the ICTS, and wouldn&apos;t need the subway replacement at all.





I mean density.That&apos;s considerably different, but you don&apos;t make the land available by expropriation for a transit corridor. Let the developers do their work.





Didn&apos;t bring Lower Bay into this,
It&apos;s relevant.




Wow, you are so nitpicky!

More like you aren&apos;t picky enough. Like I said before, if you are not clear and precise, why should you be taken seriously? noob(but not really) November 18th, 2007, 09:09 PM Electrify wasn&apos;t the one who asked the question.

No one asked the question, but Electrify wasn&apos;t clear enough, so I added to what he said.

Ridership increase is implied if streetcar traffic is increasing.

A streetcar line would not have cost so much time, nor money to build or operate. It would also be a much more attractive service, which would&apos;ve increased ridership, putting it in the same position as the current ICTS. People would still complain about the Kennedy transfer.

For these reasons, I&apos;m 100% sure that if the SRT was never built, we&apos;d be taking B-D to STC by now.

Lower Bay hasn&apos;t been relevant since 1966. I may not have been precise enough for you a few times, but the same goes for you.

When the SRT was built, the province paid for a vast majority of it, saving huge sums of money for the TTC, making it much MUCH cheaper than building it as a streetcar line. However, while the Kennedy transfer would have been the same, that&apos;s true, even if the service was more popular (not necessarily, although I&apos;d be inclined to agree better planning principles would probably have been applied as a streetcar line), it would have been far easier and cheaper to adjust the service as a streetcar line than the ICTS is capable of and would still not require a subway.

If the ridership were triple(which I think it would be), then a subway would be needed.

Bloor should have a subway. I think what you are saying is that Queen should have gotten one first.

Not a question, true, but this statement is what effectively started the topic, and was what I was referring to. This was in response to Electrify stating Bloor shouldn&apos;t even have a subway at all. I put no words in your mouth, I only quote your own posts without re-writing them, unlike some people I debate with.



Face it, you&apos;re wrong. I do know what I&apos;m talking about afterall.

I am correcting your misconveyance on the facts of history - because you did make a mistake. Just admit it and thank me for pointing out the error. I&apos;m the only one pointing this out because not many people care about history (I used to be among such people at one time, they are indeed a majority too if you check statistics on how familiar Canadians are with their own history).





If the ridership were triple(which I think it would be), then a subway would be needed.
I don&apos;t think it would be triple. Double, maybe, a bit optimistic but I wouldn&apos;t rule it out. Double though, would still be manageable by LRT (with the proper design).

With a multi-unit LRT vehicle, with the proper track and station design (which the TTC wasn&apos;t going to implement, FTR), can reach about 1/3 of the capacity a 6-car subway can with ATC (which none of the current system has except Sheppard, and Sheppard can&apos;t really take advantage of it due to lack of demand), 1/2 or more the capacity of a 6-car subway without ATC. The difference is coming from variations in the headway limitations and, directly related to that, signal system differences.





You can&apos;t assume that. Knowing how long the public has been shortchanged, they&apos;d be more inclined to welcome it than protest.Didn&apos;t work for the ROWs (they went through anyway, yes, but not without a fight or in St.Clair&apos;s case, a court battle), and they didn&apos;t even require expropriation, so why would it work for your subway? Expropriating property is NOT popular, this is simply common sense. You should only be doing this if you have to, not because it&apos;s convenient. You have no sense of humanity.

You have to assume and prepare for the worst. Nothing goes without a hitch in these kinds of projects.

And I already told you I don&apos;t care for interlining.

You may not care for interlining, but the TTC has it in their system, which is what matters (the fact that it is there), it is also there for Sheppard I&apos;ll point out (has never been used for carrying passengers, but it used use for yard access), and the streetcar system is interlined like crazy - you think the streetcars should cease the interlining practice?

If it&apos;s between double and triple(or just double) I think it would be enough(but I still think ridership would be triple) to build a subway when you factor in that transfer, and that the situation wouldn&apos;t be as desperate with LRT.

Oh crap. My theory is looking more plausible now, because the TTC would&apos;nt have went with this&quot;proper design&quot;. ;)

I meant an interlined service, not connecting lines to one another via tracking. And of course there is a wye for Sheppard, how else would the trains get stored at Davisville? :nuts: Epi November 20th, 2007, 02:53 AM But it would happen anyway. Look at Sheppard. My plan just speeds up the process.

They built Sheppard under the road. They didn&apos;t take away people&apos;s homes for this.

I think they should just take away your home and build something on top of it, maybe then you will understand that expropriation kind of sucks.

But I already posted there, so we&apos;ll leave it at that.Everybody believes him, and they&apos;re right - your poor communication skills had you make an ass of yourself, congratulations, suck it up and show a little humility and then everyone will forgive and forget about it.





I will not admit to a mistake, because there wasn&apos;t one. The most I&apos;ll give you is not elaborating enough for your tastes.Look, this isn&apos;t even the fault of your use of language, it is the fact that you managed to list everything but the most important point in the whole matter, and act like those were the main reasons. The fact is that Electrify was closer to the main issue than you ever were - Electrify referred directly to transit usage, a more relevant factor than vehicular traffic. Like I already said, vehicular traffic only shows the capacity supplied. If ridership on that line is stable and not near, at, or over capacity at the 45-second headways, then the situation may not have required a subway and the TTC would have been agreeable to the city&apos;s proposal. The key point was that ridership was already at capacity and forecasted to continue to increase. That&apos;s the single most important reason, and traffic on Bloor-Danforth does not illustrate this at all, nor do the future extensions and stuff that you mentioned matter compared to that either. Get over it, you messed up, just like in the St.Clair thread, now show a little humility and everyone will forgive and forget about it.

Everybody makes mistakes every so often. Myself included, I concede when I&apos;m proven wrong - I not sure whether or not you&apos;ve proven me wrong yet though, but other forumers have caught me slip up. It happens to everyone sometimes, accept it, shrug your shoulders, and carry on. You act like a child who is completely undisciplined and used to always getting his way with his parents. That&apos;s why I asked how old you are. Show some maturity here. We&apos;re supposed to be adults. I&apos;m not interested in dealing with a 12 year-old.





If it&apos;s between double and triple(or just double) I think it would be enough(but I still think ridership would be triple) to build a subway when you factor in that transfer, and that the situation wouldn&apos;t be as desperate with LRT.

The situation wouldn&apos;t be as desperate with LRT because LRT has the capacity to keep up.


Oh crap. My theory is looking more plausible now, because the TTC would&apos;nt have went with this&quot;proper design&quot;. ;)Well, the original design can be modified at a later date for the most part, except for Kennedy, the most complicated part (that would be back to square one for that station... no MCC references :P). Kennedy&apos;s not cheap, but way cheaper than doing a new subway station and extension. Your theory is no more plausible now as a result of this. It would have been a much easier situation to work with than the reworking the RT is facing right now - and would be possible to keep the Streetcars in service with a small amount of temporary trackage since the infrastructure required for them can be minimal if needed - ICTS can&apos;t be as accomodating, and that&apos;s what would keep LRT going instead of replacing it with a subway. On what grounds do you think ridership would be triple, btw?





But it would happen anyway. Look at Sheppard. My plan just speeds up the process.You totally missed the point. Unbelievable. See Epi&apos;s post.





Good idea. We can fall back on your plans if mine fail.Why not save 10s of billions of dollars and over a decade of time and just skip your plan altogether, we know it will fail anyway.

Transportation agency recommends province give the TTC $424 million for signal system, new trains
November 24, 2007
Tess Kalinowski
Toronto Star Transportation Reporter

The TTC has received fresh support to expand capacity on its overburdened Yonge-University subway line in a large package of transit improvements approved yesterday by the Greater Toronto Transportation Authority.

The province&apos;s new transportation planning body is recommending the province give the TTC $424 million over the next five years to install an automated signal system and add 21 trains and crossover tracks on the 55-year-old Yonge line.

Together, the improvements would allow Canada&apos;s oldest and busiest subway line to handle 30 to 50 per cent more passengers by 2017.

Work on the signal system, known as automatic train control, has already begun as part of keeping the TTC in good repair.

The computerized system, considered the international standard, replaces the colourful wayside signals that tell train operators whether to speed up, slow down or stop.

But as the TTC tries to keep up with a backlog of renovations, items like that have contributed to a massive shortfall predicted to hit the commission&apos;s long-term capital budget.

If the province agrees to pay for the subway improvements, it would alleviate that shortfall an estimated $698 million to $1.5 billion between 2008 and 2012 according to TTC chair Adam Giambrone.

The new trains, to be delivered starting in 2009, can accommodate about 10 per cent more people 1,200 to 1,300 passengers and are considered about three times as reliable as the existing model.

They also come ready to use the new signal system, which will make it possible to run them at higher frequency, said Giambrone, who also sits on the GTTA.

&quot;You take all of that together and we have up to a 50 per cent capacity increase. You could run a train every 10 seconds but you wouldn&apos;t be able to get people on and off trains, so you have to be realistic,&quot;he said.

The Bloor-Danforth line, which isn&apos;t quite as crowded yet, will eventually be converted to automatic train control too, he said.

The GTTA also is recommending $7.1 million for startup costs on the Transit City light rail network and a designated bus lane on Yonge St. between Finch and Steeles Aves. that would give mass transit vehicles from around the region priority on the heavily congested stretch.

The subway improvements, including the new Toronto Rocket trains, are a prerequisite to expanding the Yonge subway into York Region, TTC chief general manager Gary Webster told the GTTA.

The TTC projects were among more than a dozen selected by the authority as the next round of transportation priorities among a $9 billion regional wish list.

Others include bus rapid transit along Hurontario St. in Mississauga, another BRT line along Dundas St. in Burlington and Oakville, and service expansions on York Region&apos;s VIVA transit.

There&apos;s no guarantee Queen&apos;s Park will fund the projects, but all are among the 52 improvements called for in Premier Dalton McGuinty&apos;s MoveOntario 2020 plan, announced in June.

An earlier list of so-called&quot;quick wins&quot;projects chosen because they could be initiated quickly and demonstrate the GTTA&apos;s seriousness about getting the region moving was released in July.

It included a series of GO Transit expansions, improved bus service in Hamilton and a new Cornell transit terminal in Markham.

In September, McGuinty endorsed that list.

The GTTA has also committed to creating an integrated web-based trip planner that would allow transit users to easily plot trips that require transferring across the various regional transit systems. TRZ November 25th, 2007, 09:21 AM ^^ It isn&apos;t mentioned in the article, but that signal system improvement on the Yonge will also allow all-night service on the Yonge (trains would probably be turning back at Union at first during the initial operation period?) hkskyline November 30th, 2007, 05:18 PM Still a subway to nowhere?
Construction booms, but opinions remain sharply divided as the often-derided Sheppard line turns 5
24 November 2007
The Toronto Star

The futuristic chrome plating in Sheppard-Yonge station already looks a little scuffed. But it was only five years ago - Nov. 22, 2002 - that then-mayor Mel Lastman cut the ribbon to open Toronto&apos;s northern east-west subway line, accompanied by a phalanx of dignitaries, reporters, children and musicians. Even the U of T&apos;s infamously discordant engineering department band came out to crash the event in the former North York, piling onto the subway cars with tubas and drums in tow.

The new line was always central to Lastman&apos;s long-held dream, going back before amalgamation, to when he was mayor of North York and wanted it to have a downtown - an urban focal point that could compete with the big one in the old city of Toronto. The Sheppard line would not only spur development along its path, but speed commuters into North York City Centre.

There were tall buildings in the area before this subway opened, but five years of operation has transformed the landscape. Both Yonge St. and Sheppard Ave. E. are dotted with construction sites and billboards announcing new projects. Tens of thousands of residents have moved into the corridor, with tens of thousands more to come.

But old questions still dog the billion-dollar line. Why is it still so easy to get a seat on the trains? Why are the sidewalks on Sheppard so empty? Are we creating urbanity or merely plunking a lot of tall buildings into a suburban landscape where residents are more likely to drive than walk or use transit?

It depends who you ask.

&quot;A very definite urban design theme has emerged,&quot;says Niall Haggart, vice-president of the Daniels Corp., which has brought more than 2,500 condo units to the corridor.&quot;I think that someone will be able to walk out of their building and have eyes on the street.&quot;

He adds that when the NY Towers project was introduced,&quot;it was marketed with the Sheppard subway clearly front and centre.&quot;

Dianne Braun, who lives in a condo near Bayview Ave. and Sheppard, says the subway is a pleasant amenity - but she doesn&apos;t use it. She drives to her job as an executive assistant even though her office is right on the subway, too, at Yonge and Eglinton.

&quot;I get free parking at the office, and it&apos;s underground parking, so I prefer it,&quot;she says, though she thinks the Sheppard subway has made her neighbourhood more desirable.

Jane Renwick, editor of Urbanation, a quarterly that tracks Toronto&apos;s condo market, is among those impressed by downtown North York&apos;s transformation.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of highrise residential,&quot;she says.&quot;You look at it, and you think, &apos;This could be any small city in the U.S.&apos; ... it&apos;s becoming a bigger centre, and I think that&apos;s ultimately because it&apos;s a transportation hub.&quot;

Then there&apos;s Brian Harvey, a librarian who lives in a condo near Yonge and rides the Sheppard line to work every day.

&quot;There&apos;s absolutely nothing along Sheppard that&apos;s worth going to, except for IKEA, if you&apos;re an IKEA person, and I&apos;m really not,&quot;he says.&quot;Other than that, there&apos;s about 25 blocks between anything of note.&quot;

Harvey might be exaggerating a bit, but Sheppard today still has the feel of a high-speed suburban arterial - an adolescent road in the midst of a sudden and painful maturation. New towers loom behind single-family bungalows. Parkettes front onto six uncrossable lanes of speeding traffic. And nearly everywhere you look, there&apos;s construction.

Near Sheppard and Leslie St., giant piles of earth mark the site of the biggest project of all: Concord Park Place, a 17-hectare master-planned community that is expected to eventually hold 10,000 residents. It&apos;s so big it will have its own shuttle bus to ferry people to and from the nearest TTC stations - Bessarion and Leslie, the two least-used subway stops in Toronto.

Change hasn&apos;t been easy. The scale and speed of the developments that followed the subway took both residents and elected officials by surprise. The city found its land-use plans being overturned by the Ontario Municipal Board, the provincial panel that has the last word on what gets built in Toronto. Meanwhile, neighbourhood associations waged trench warfare against developers who wanted to build towers - almost literally - in their backyards.

&quot;We didn&apos;t really care for the subway along Sheppard,&quot;says Poonam Jain, president of the Bayview Village Association.&quot;It didn&apos;t seem to make sense. Even now, people are talking about how Mel Lastman managed to wrangle it, even though there were other places in Toronto that needed subways.&quot;

Jain says residents knew there would be some development along the way, but not this much. With development comes noise, disruption and traffic - traffic that overflows from Sheppard and infiltrates the winding, residential streets nearby.

&quot;We had a lovely peaceful place here - an island of serenity - and it&apos;s being destroyed,&quot;she says.

In response, groups such as the Bayview Village Association and the Sheppard-Leslie Homeowners Association - a group formed specifically to fight another new development - dug in their heels, insisting that the condo towers be scaled back, if not cancelled.

But the subway is also the reason some condo-dwelling, transit-riding newcomers have chosen to make the area home.

&quot;When we moved to Toronto, we basically lived here for the subway,&quot;says Nori Bradley, a former Vancouverite and now a University of Toronto medical student who lives at Bayview and Sheppard. Like her husband, she commutes to the old downtown every day. Bradley says that living on the subway lets her leave her car in the garage 80 per cent of the time, except for trips to Costco and her husband&apos;s hockey games.

This summer, during the budget crisis at city hall when Mayor David Miller mulled mothballing the Sheppard line as a cost-saving measure, the story hit home.

&quot;Closing it down would totally change our lives,&quot;Bradley says.&quot;To shut it down would be like shutting us off from everything.&quot;

In the end, the line was spared, but the so-called&quot;subway to nowhere&quot;remains a subject of debate and an object of derision, even if daily ridership has risen steadily over the past five years to 43,260 from 34,700 (Projections had called for 48,000 in Year 1).

The line was originally meant to run out to Scarborough, but was truncated to its current five stations. Construction started in parallel with another line along Eglinton West - a project that many continue to argue was a much bigger priority. But after the provincial Conservatives came to power in 1995, work was halted and the Eglinton pit filled in. Lastman and others, however, won a reprieve for Sheppard.

The fact that Sheppard was never built to its full length still rankles city councillor David Shiner. A committed supporter of the line, Shiner pins the neighbourhood&apos;s growing pains on the line&apos;s curtailment, and the OMB, which let development run beyond what the city had planned for.

&quot;We&apos;ve ended up in a situation where there&apos;s almost double the development that was proposed, the traffic impacts have been horrendous and the subway line does not carry people anywhere but to Yonge St. and downtown,&quot;he says.

&quot;I think the No. 1 priority of the city right now should be to complete the Sheppard line out to Scarborough. The residents of Scarborough and the residents of North York deserve to have a better trans link into the centre of the city.&quot;

To the dismay of Shiner and other subway boosters, finishing the line doesn&apos;t seem to be in the cards any time soon. The TTC&apos;s latest plan for the corridor calls for a streetcar right-of-way, or LRT, to complete the route along Sheppard.

&quot;Instead of spending a billion dollars to finish the line, we can do (about) 10 times as much LRT for that same amount of money,&quot;TTC chair Adam Giambrone says.

Giambrone adds that he&apos;d like to see the subway finished, but it could be decades before enough ridership and money are in place.

Meanwhile, many still ask whether Sheppard - with its asphalt-surrounded malls, long blocks and suburban cul-de-sacs dotted with occasional highrises - was ever a good candidate for a subway.

Among those is veteran transportation consultant Ed Levy.

&quot;A few highrise towers on the skyline does not indicate subway-type density,&quot;he says.

&quot;There&apos;s hardly a building more than 20 or 25 storeys high in all of Brooklyn,&quot;he says,&quot;but it&apos;s lined with neighbourhoods that have townhousing and four- to six-storey apartments solidly, mile after mile after mile. They&apos;re able to fill up subway lines running about a mile apart.&quot;But here, he says, single-family neighbourhoods are sacrosanct.

&quot;Any time someone dares breathe something over three, four, five storeys, there&apos;s general hysteria.&quot;

Ken Greenberg, a local planning consultant, points out that Sheppard is&quot;relying on bus feeder lines, as opposed to a large walking population around it.&quot;

To truly be successful, he says, the city needs to allow intensification away from the major intersections where towers are currently sprouting, and into the entire catchment area for the subways - including the quiet neighbourhoods, whose residents want none of it.

But for the people, like Bradley, who bought a home to be on the subway, the subway means one thing: a way to get downtown - the real downtown.

&quot;The state of transit in Toronto is a joke. I mean, it&apos;s the biggest city in Canada; if you don&apos;t live on the subway line, you can&apos;t get anywhere.&quot; Electrify November 30th, 2007, 09:39 PM Dianne Braun, who lives in a condo near Bayview Ave. and Sheppard, says the subway is a pleasant amenity - but she doesn&apos;t use it. She drives to her job as an executive assistant even though her office is right on the subway, too, at Yonge and Eglinton.

$10 bucks says she would be able to get to her work about 10 times faster at rush hour on the subway than by driving, save a ton in gas too.

Anyways, they should not have built Bessarion, and instead built a station at Willowdale Ave, or even closer to Yonge St. This I think would have spread out downtown North York into an actual area, rather than simply a strip.

Also, allow metropass or even free parking at Don Mills station. This would be great for car commuters from Aurora, Newmarket, Georgina, etc. where taking the Viva or driving to Finch or York Mills may not be practical (if you are to drive to Leslie to park, you might as well drive to York Mills and skip the transfer).

Yep. Nooo contest. How did he get re-elected? One number: 905.

I have proposed incorporating Sheppard into a DRL in other threads, turning it south along Vic Park until Eglinton Square area, then swinging through Flemingdon Park and Pape Village on the way to downtown along Richmond and Adelaide (and reconnecting to the B-D at Dundas West). This would see its ridership skyrocket since it would allow it to be used as a transfer-free access into downtown along many locations that are popular but not serviced directly by Yonge.

There was a reason for this: Finch Station alone sees twice as many rides as the entire Sheppard Line.

The infrastructure is already designed in a way that would allow Sheppard trains to run directly through on the Yonge, so it is not a question of it not being designed to do so. It is an operations decision to keep as many trains going to Finch as possible. The math would certainly suggest that this is a smart move. allurban December 1st, 2007, 11:29 AM (How Harris got re-elected is totally beyond me)Harris got re-elected for 3 reasons.

1. When you get a chance to drive on Shapperd Ave. from Bayview to Younge St. at anytime, you&apos;ll realize that there is no such thing as rush hour traffic.

2. Bessarion station was built for the Canadian Tire/shopping complex and future development. Also to shorten the gap between Bayview and Leslie, which is much larger than Bayview and Younge.

Incorrect. The distance between Bayview and Leslie is comparable to Bayview and Yonge&apos;s distance - while it is true that Bayview to Leslie is longer, it is not by a wide margin. Willowdale has no spacing issues as it would be about equal to the distance from Bessarion to the next station in either direction. Willowdale would frankly have had more value than Bessarion in terms of ridership since Willowdale is a far more recognized street and holds more activity potential than Bessarion. While stations are indeed expensive and the costs must be evaluated, if Bessarion made the cut, one wonders how Willowdale didn&apos;t, particularly since there is some recongizable commercial activity in the area of Willowdale and Sheppard.

Had the Bill Davis Conservatives remained in Queens Park a year longer, this plan might have become reality. Ever since the opening of the Yonge Subway in 1954, Conservative governments of the day had provided strong support to the TTC and its major capital projects. However, the release of Network 2011 coincided with the defeat of the Conservatives and the formation of the first Liberal government in 42 years. The Liberals, wary of the $5 billion price tag attached to Network 2011, put the plan under review. Infuriatingly, it was at this time that Highway 407 received provincial funds and took the first steps towards construction.

The TTC frequently reminds people of the cars it keeps off the roads every day simply by having subway, bus and streetcar service. But now it says it will go even further in its environmental campaign.

The commission says it will begin introducing new subway cars and streetcars with technical improvements that will lower electricity use.

Electricity consumption is the main focus for the public transportation system, which hopes to save money by cutting its use.

The TTC is the second-biggest consumer of electricity in Toronto—after the city&apos;s water department—and they&apos;re trying to conserve, partly to save money and partly to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce pollution.

The TTC is also committing that it will get 25 per cent of its electricity from the purchase of more expensive renewable sources, even though that commitment may increase costs by as much as $2.5 million per year.

TTC chair Adam Giambrone says people want renewable energy and he&apos;s predicting they are willing to pay for it.

So Mel was AGAINST the Sheppard line, Toronto was focused on developing suburbs rather than downtown,


Transit Toronto seems to have conflicted sources on this... the more widely accepted version of the story is here, found at this link also on Transit Toronto - http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5110.shtml

The fact that Toronto has a Sheppard subway at all is due to the efforts of Mel Lastman. When he was Mayor of North York, he had a grand vision of turning his sleepy suburban borough into a city in its own right, with a downtown to challenge that of the City of Toronto. To his credit, he understood, more than many other people who have tried similar feats, that a downtown cant be just for cars pedestrians must be accommodated, as must people who use public transit. So he located his downtown on a major rapid transit line, the Yonge subway, and convinced the TTC to build an additional station, North York Centre, to service it. To further enhance his downtown, he latched onto the proposal to build a subway along Sheppard Avenue between the Spadina subway and the Scarborough Town Centre. By building a rapid-transit crossroads, he believed that development would bloom in his new downtown.

The Network 2011 proposal might have been built had Bill Davis stayed on as premier of Ontario one more year. The fall of the Conservative government of 1985 brought the Liberal Party to power, and they blanched at Network 2011s $2.1 billion sticker price. The Sheppard line itself was priced at one billion 1985 dollars. The proposal was delayed and deferred, until a scaled-down version was proposed by the Liberals in 1990. Then the Liberals too were defeated, by the NDP and Bob Rae. The Sheppard subway was delayed for another four years.

By the time the NDP granted enough funding to get the shovels into the ground, 1994, the price tag had ballooned and both Queens Park and Metro Toronto were reeling from the effects of a major recession. There wasnt enough money to build all of the needed subways at once, so to get construction started, and to make sure that all of the players within Metro were satisfied with the spending they received, the first phase of the Sheppard subway was cut back from Victoria Park to Don Mills. A shortened Eglinton West subway started construction from the Spadina line to Black Creek Drive at the same time. This political compromise was all for naught, however. As soon as the Conservatives under Mike Harris won the 1995 election, the Eglinton West subway project was cancelled and the province dropped all capital funding of public transit. Sheppard was itself almost cancelled, but Mel Lastmans lobbying saved the line. After considerable political jockeying (where, at one point, Metro council agreed to build the Sheppard subway tunnels but not the tracks or the stations), the lines future was confirmed. Construction continued unabated through to 2002. TRZ December 4th, 2007, 01:19 PM I think the Sheppard line is a complete failure.
It would be an effective transit corridor if it went anywhere but it doesn&apos;t. If it went to STC in the east and joined up with the Spadina ext or preferably the coming Jane LRT.

No, this ship has (for better or for worse) sailed, and it is obvious that the corridor cannot sustain a subway. I&apos;d have liked to see it, but a change of strategy is badly needed - especially considering the competitive tax incentive/advantage the downtown
core can be expected to re-capture after tax reforms start to come into full force in 2015 (or 2012 from the federal level, 2015 is for the municipal level controls). Sheppard should go towards Vic Park as originally planned, but then swing down Vic Park on the way to downtown, via Flemingdon, and via Pape.


Now all it will do is slow people down from getting from one end of North York to the other.
Going from Malvern to YorkU will now require LRT to DonMills then Sheppard line to Yonge then transfer to a bus to Spadina and then head north.
It will be slow, tiresome, and require endless transfers. Thios is exactly the thing that inhibits people from taking transit. This kind of a thing not only makes transit slower but is also viewed as&quot;work&quot;by its patrons. OMG!!! You said something I agree with!!! :eek: All hope is not lost on the LRTs though. Transit City&apos;s&quot;as is&quot;proposal right now should not be considered the final picture. I have yet to see anything to confirm the rumour, but some people have suggested the TTC is out to build the Sheppard LRT as quickly as possible to get rid of any future pressure on extending the subway further east. I don&apos;t know what their take on extensions further south would be though (probably a lot more favourable than eastward though, at anyrate).
The LRTs are not a lost cause though, because if the Finch West LRT is extended east of Yonge-Finch Terminal, to Don Mills (still along the Hydro Corridor, I&apos;d imagine), the Sheppard and Finch (via Don Mills LRT interline/overlap service) and Jane lines can all interline into one another. Interline with Morningside and Kingston Road and you can almost have a complete loop (just missing the part from Jane Bloor to Roncesvalles), terminating the rest of the Finch West line at York University (as it is a subway connection-to-be), or alternating their interlining (not necessarily recommended, but doable)

Reconfigure TransitCity so that the Sheppard Line is transfered to LRT and goes to Jane to make it a true rapid transit corridor. It would be a crosstown LRT line and be truly rapid. You can have all the rapid transit systems in the world but if they are short with endless transfers to other lines the patron gets tired and the ride is anything but rapid.

I am starting to see this idea come up in increased frequency, and people just don&apos;t understand that it is not so simple. First off, it is difficult to justify the decomissioning of relatively new infrastructure at great cost to decomission as well as after the great cost to commission in the first place, especially if the long-term forecast is going to see such infrastructure restored at a future date. Yes, the Eglinton Line is being designed as a subway-upgrade-compatible LRT, however, that hardly means for a second that Sheppard is a LRT-downgrade-compatible subway, far from it. Lowering the platforms (among other things, as services such as plumbing are likely inside the platform) is complicated and time consuming - and cannot take place while service is still running (which is the most important part). If the designers are fly, they can design the Eglinton LRT to have most of the necessary upgrades put into place while the thing is still in service. If done in pre-cast concrete component platforms (they could probably do up to 2m wide components, which would require somewhere around 75 components per platform), they might be able to do the cross-over in a week or two. This is a comparatively short service disruption. Converting the Sheppard HRT into LRT, which not only requires lowering the platforms, but heightening the tunnels (streetcars with pantographs require taller tunnels... I can confirm this first hand as I can compare to the Tokyo subway, which do use pantographs on a supreme majority of the system), would surely take close to a year (best case), or more. The bus operations that would be required to supplement the subway provide no meaningful savings and the bus fleet hardly has any vehicles to spare to send such a large platoon to the Sheppard corridor. TRZ December 4th, 2007, 01:35 PM It was redundent to build a line at Eglinton because the bus lines that run on the road would have to run anyways. Not just the 34 Eglinton East, but also the 100 Flemington Park, 51 Leslie, 54 Lawrance East, and the 56 (I forgot where). You can&apos;t build a Eglinton line without significant desruptions to existing travel patterns, where as a Sheppard line only affects the 84 Sheppard. No, it was not just the 84 Sheppard. Also, you are talking about Eglinton EAST routes, the subway that got cancelled was for Eglinton WEST... HELLOOOOOOOOO :nuts:

Plus, the Sheppard line have brought great convinence to me, (I live on Leslie and York Mills), and I thank the mayor for that. Yep, because the whole city revolves around you, as long as you benefit from the subway it justifies the billion dollar investment the city made in this line, and its 10-million dollar annual shortfall thereafter every year.

2. If you&apos;re so passionate about the Eglinton Subway, then you certainly are not thinking about the people who live in my area are you? So why does everything have to revolve around in stead? And if the Sheppard line has a 10 million deficit, what do you think the deficit of many other TTC services are? Why don&apos;t we just cancel them all? In fact, forget TTC, why don&apos;t we cancel health care as well? And public education? Those have deficit too

3. Again Mel Lastman was mayor for over a decade, and he did no worse than what Miller is doing now. And he had much harder times during his term than Miller does right now. He eased the amalgamation of the 5 cities into Greater Toronto very well. You think the city is short of money now?

:ohno: You&apos;re not very familiar with the history here, obviously. Eglinton was scrapped while Sheppard was allowed to proceed, when this should have been reversed. It doesn&apos;t matter whether we&apos;re talking about east or west in this case (it does matter really, and it makes Eglinton&apos;s case even stronger still, since it would put more action onto U-S than Y, which doesn&apos;t need any extra stress like the Sheppard Line supplies), the point is that the corridor gets started, and after it is started, it can get extended. Both were to be extended as time went on.

2. If you&apos;re so passionate about the Eglinton Subway, then you certainly are not thinking about the people who live in my area are you?Neither are you, actually, as there are a lot of people that lived there before the subway-spurred condo boom that never wanted the subway there in the first place - they still live there, and are not impressed by the change in the corridor. This is probably why Mel Lastman was against Sheppard in the early 80s but 10 years after that had turned into a supporter for it. You can write them off as NIMBYs, but some of their arguments are valid, and more importantly, there are far better places to drop a subway - Eglinton being a big one.

Why don&apos;t we just cancel them all?Because some lines do make money - these lines are outnumbered by the lines that lose money though. The main problem in balancing it out is that the loss-incurring lines feed the profitable ones, so you can&apos;t cut the loss-making lines without dragging the profitable ones into the red and hurting the system overall. Given the current management of the system, there is no way to realistically trace detailed patterns of where routes are getting fed from.In fact, forget TTC, why don&apos;t we cancel health care as well? And public education? Those have deficit tooHealth care and public education (excluding post-secondary) are not pay-to-use. The TTC is pay-to-use, so don&apos;t compare apples to oranges.

Eglinton was abandoned because it was unfeasiable to build a line there. I have already provided some of the reasons, and there are many many more. Let&apos;s get over this fact, if you don&apos;t like it, file a negligent lawsuit against the pervious government.

You repeatedly insult a mayor who has done great things for a city, and who is responsible for the entire transformation of NYCC. If you don&apos;t like him, fine, don&apos;t spread false claims about him either.

TRZ December 6th, 2007, 01:33 PM Eglinton was abandoned because it was unfeasiable to build a line there. I have already provided some of the reasons, and there are many many more. Let&apos;s get over this fact, if you don&apos;t like it, file a negligent lawsuit against the pervious government. This is what I was talking about with your statements being false when you claim they are facts. The Eglinton subway was not abandoned because it was unfeasable. That&apos;s got to be one of the biggest pieces of BS you&apos;ve posted. If it was unfeasable, it would never have gotten to the point where construction had started. It was already under construction when it was cancelled, so obviously it had been studied and argued feasable, although the methods of these studies are questionable since they gave Sheppard a green light as well. The only reason Eglinton was abandoned was because its provincial support was withdrawn. What happened to the Spadina Expressway happened to the Eglinton Subway in a sense, they were killed by the exact same political mechanics, although in different eras and under very different circumstances with completely opposite motives and results. You have not provided any actual reasons, either, since you failed to even focus on the proper portion of route. Eglinton has long been a priority corridor across its entire length on the TTC&apos;s map of expansion priorities - there are multiple such maps among report documents on its website. The TTC has studied numberous corridors and is in the process of other studies - always is. Sheppard is not as important as Eglinton, not even close.

You repeatedly insult a mayor who has done great things for a city, and who is responsible for the entire transformation of NYCC. If you don&apos;t like him, fine, don&apos;t spread false claims about him either.They&apos;re not false, these have already been through the news, if they were false, the news stories would have been retracted, which never happened, nor were any libel suits filed. NYCC is not that significant anyway - if it were, the Sheppard Line would have been more successful, but it isn&apos;t. Things may still change over the next 5 years, but that was also said 5 years ago. The Sheppard Line has yet to meet its ridership projection for its first year - that&apos;s sad.

If the TTC was serious about extending the line, they would have pushed for an extension of that subway line in Transit City&apos;s proposal - and they would have gotten it too with the provincial spending spree in effect. Also, the transfer in the middle of the corridor is a big deal, that&apos;s not conductive to ridership at all. I suspect that this has some relationship to the Don Mills line and Finch line should the Finch line get extended east of the York Region Terminal. The people at the TTC are clearly not impressed with the performance of the Sheppard Subway Line so much that they are prepared to cut their losses and improve suburban access to the system by other, lower-risk methods. Not continuing the subway is a big deal, that is a decision that would have been carefully weighed, especially given the priority they had been placing on it in earlier years. They would have at least tried to pull a partially underground LRT at its connection point at Don Mills, but that is not something I would expect to happen at this point - the fact that they want to do the Sheppard Line first in Transit City, another mystery since that is not in sync with the reports published for the evaluations of each line (the report strongly points to Jane before Sheppard, but Jane is not getting first dibs), is further evidence that they want to put a cork in the subway extension&apos;s public pressure. They are going to tunnel Eglinton in the same manner as a subway would be tunneled for that LRT though, which shows that the TTC is indeed very serious about the Eglinton subway coming, probably sooner rather than later, as that is unquestionably the next Bloor-Subway-in-waiting (...except for the Etobicoke portion). allurban December 7th, 2007, 08:01 AM They are going to tunnel Eglinton in the same manner as a subway would be tunneled for that LRT though, which shows that the TTC is indeed very serious about the Eglinton subway coming, probably sooner rather than later, as that is unquestionably the next Bloor-Subway-in-waiting (...except for the Etobicoke portion).Therein lies an interesting point...why did network 2011 include an Eglinton&quot;West&quot;and a Sheppard&quot;east&quot;line? Was TTC looking at a trying to build a subway in a different way from Bloor Danforth (which was built across the city then extended at both ends)?

One wonders why the planners didnt want to build the Eglinton and Sheppard lines the same way as Bloor Danforth, extending east and west from Yonge, and reducing pressure on Yonge and Spadina as well?

Perhaps they were keen on Eglinton West and Sheppard East for other reasons? The first phase of the Eglinton West line would have ended at Black Creek Drive, and would have lots of space for parking or a future yard. The Sheppard East line would end at Don Mills road, again, with space for future yards and lots of parking....or development as needed...

I expect that the initial costs of tunneling east and west from Yonge....would have been alot higher, but the result would be very effective at completing a network...and reducing pressure on Yonge.

I believe that the TTC would be in a better network position today if they had built Eglinton and Sheppard extending east and west of Yonge.

Even if they stopped subway construction and moved to LRT, it would not be so bad...this would be following the tried-and-true success of bloor-danforth, which still ran streetcars at the ends of the lines for some years before extensions happened.

Any thoughts?

Cheers, m TRZ December 7th, 2007, 12:13 PM Therein lies an interesting point...why did network 2011 include an Eglinton&quot;West&quot;and a Sheppard&quot;east&quot;line? Was TTC looking at a trying to build a subway in a different way from Bloor Danforth (which was built across the city then extended at both ends)?My understanding is that this was partially to do with politics (serving both east and west ends equally), and partly to do with the plans for sub-downtowns - of which Sheppard-Yonge is supposed to be one of them. Eglinton would have seen additional use go into the Spadina subway, underused at the time, arguably still is today although it is showing stronger signs lately these days. Eglinton I believe was also supposed to be a boom for Mount Dennis area - back then, a GO Station at that location had already been proposed, and the environmental assessment for that station is already complete, GO just has to make a RFP (or do it in-house at their engineering dept.).

One wonders why the planners didnt want to build the Eglinton and Sheppard lines the same way as Bloor Danforth, extending east and west from Yonge, and reducing pressure on Yonge and Spadina as well?There&apos;s a good argument that if both Sheppard and Eglinton both went in both directions from Yonge, Yonge would not be able to handle it. Too much demand, not enough capacity. There isn&apos;t enough capacity already today - capacity south of Bloor has been maxed out for years. The ridership on that portion has been steady, but would have actually gone up if there was capacity to absorb the demand, but there isn&apos;t, so ridership is flat at its max-out point. I have raised serious concerns about Transit City causing this problem before as well.

Perhaps they were keen on Eglinton West and Sheppard East for other reasons? The first phase of the Eglinton West line would have ended at Black Creek Drive, and would have lots of space for parking or a future yard. The Sheppard East line would end at Don Mills road, again, with space for future yards and lots of parking....or development as needed...Sheppard East was supposed to end at Victoria Park, not Don Mills. If Sheppard did need its own yard, it probably would have gone just south-east of Leslie, across the East Don. But you are absolutely correct about Eglinton West, a yard could easily be worked into either the rail corridor or the Flats.

I expect that the initial costs of tunneling east and west from Yonge....would have been alot higher, but the result would be very effective at completing a network...and reducing pressure on Yonge.I beg to differ. How do you figure they would not add pressure on Yonge? I totally do not see the logic in that statement.

I believe that the TTC would be in a better network position today if they had built Eglinton and Sheppard extending east and west of Yonge.There&apos;s a good argument that skipping Sheppard and doing just Eglinton in both directions would have had the most network&quot;oomph&quot;. The projections in the Transit City reports certainly seem to strongly support this, Eglinton is a ridership cow waiting to be milked. The thing with Sheppard though, as others have pointed out before either in this thread or others, is that Finch would have been better than Sheppard for a subway north of Eglinton. Indeed, Transit City&apos;s reports show the Finch West line performing stronger than Sheppard East&apos;s corridor by a confortable margin.

Even if they stopped subway construction and moved to LRT, it would not be so bad...this would be following the tried-and-true success of bloor-danforth, which still ran streetcars at the ends of the lines for some years before extensions happened.

Any thoughts?Sorry, this is not the same as Bloor-Danforth at all. The biggest difference is one that you already have mentioned: Bloor-Danforth went in both directions from Yonge. Also, Bloor-Danforth also had a strong streetcar presense comparable to Yonge&apos;s before it became a subway and had to turn itself into a subway too in order to meet demand. The demand in Sheppard did not warrant a subway. Eglinton is such a rich corridor though that even though its not got the streetcar presense already, the high demand and high-development pockets along it, make it a very safe bet that Eglinton would be far stronger than Sheppard and would likely see high use in a much sooner timeframe than Sheppard will take to build up. Electrify December 7th, 2007, 03:35 PM I was reading up on Transit City on Wikipedia, and it appears that other lines are going to be tunneled in high density areas as well.

It&apos;s not confirmed. Some corridors have pockets that are challenging. Jane for example is encountering concerns from residents along sections where the road is narrower. Only Eglinton has been confirmed to have a significant amount of tunnels. Others are currently being studied, but it is true that some other parts have problems. That said, Sheppard I doubt will be one of them, it has been encountering some of the least amount of opposition surprisingly enough. UD2 December 8th, 2007, 12:54 PM It&apos;s not confirmed.

Why would that be surprising? It was fielded as an alternative to the subway, which is holds very high in opinion to the people who lives in North York, Scarb and even Markham. Only it costs 10 times less, so it could actually happen.

The TTC wants to push it through because it also saves them some embracement from the ATM useless Sheppard line.

And the province have little problem with it because they have to fund something anyways.

The only people who would not like the Sheppard LRT are the ones who don’t get their lines built as early. But that&apos;s how the system works, you can&apos;t make everyone happy. Everyone is going to think that they&apos;re more important than the other guy, so what determines priority comes down to politics.

The Eglinton line will never be prioritised just because of the cost of its underground section. The TTC would rather build twice the distance at grade at other locations, than build the Eglinton line at a near subway cost. It really doesn&apos;t matter how important the Eglinton line is or becomes, its cost pretty much dooms it to the end of the line.

First 3 should be Sheppard, Jane and Finch. ssiguy2 December 8th, 2007, 08:48 PM I STILL hold firmlyabout transferring Sheppard subway over to LRT and then ext it to Spadina or prefferable to Jane.
Yes, transferring Sheppard to LRT wouldn&apos;t be easy but a hell of a lot cheaper than ext Sheppard to STC or west Spadina/ Jane.
It could be started in the east first closing Don Mills and when that is transferred the LRT could run that far and so on. It wouldn&apos;t have to be done all at once.
Also if kept to its current configuration I think Sheppard will DECREASE in riidership due to being an ineffective crosstown as people start to realise that getting from STC to York is acttually longer than it will be now. This is because right now due to Sheppard you take the line to DonMills and then transfer ONCE to get on the bus to STC but when the LRT comes on stream you will transfer TWICE because you will get on the LRT but then have to take a bus from the Sheppard LRT down to near STC but have to TRANSFER on to a bus south over the 401 to get STC.
If the line was just LRT was a complete LRT to Spadin one would only take the bus north to LRT and then enjoy a comfortable NON-TRANFERABLE trip to Spadina.

Remember transferring Sheppard to LRT will be an added cost but extending to Spadina/Jane will be hundreds of millions cheaper than ext Sheppard subway all the way over to Jane.

Why do people hate the ScarRT? Thats becuase it is too busy and requires than long walk transfer. Note the word TRANSFER. People hate to do it. If they keep the current configuration Sheppard is niothing but a group of transfers.

Also as said Sheppard subway will decrease in ridership as not only will be a bigger pain in the ass than it already is but also much of the traffic takes the line to get to the Yong line but that traaffic will be as heavy when they will be able to take the coming DonMills LRT to the Bloor line.

Transferring the whole line from on end to Malvern to Jane to complete LRT would save a small fortune than extending the Sheppard line to Spadina little alone than Jane.

It would non of the fuckin transfers that people hate..................faster, more comfortable seemless ride, cheaper, and be an effective RT line from one end of the city to the other. splashflash December 8th, 2007, 11:38 PM I have heard that conversion of the Sheppard subway into an lrt would not be possible since the tunnel is too low for pantograph operation. Perhaps a retracting pantograph could be devised so that the system could be similar to the Boston subway Blue Line. The Blue Line has pantographs and third rail. The pantographs are used on the outskirts of the city centre.

I doubt this would be practical. The Spadina Line should be extended to Yonge along Sheppard, costing $1 B, so that Sheppard is a spur of Sheppard. Eglinton subway should revert to a Eglington West line. The savings of the Eglinton line (subway) east of the Allen Rd would pay for the Sheppard West extension. An lrt tunnel would be even more costly than a third rail subway tunnel to account for pantograph; however the stations could be smaller, but would need to be enlarged later at great expense.

I think that Transit City purposely left Sheppard as a stubway to prove their point politically, that the subway would never work. Also, lrt is not 10x cheaper than subways. The lrts are about $40 M / km and the subways about $150 / km, and at most $200 M / km. That is a fifth. LRT poponents such as Giambrone are out by a factor of two. If they were looking at busways versus subway, they would be correct. UD2 December 8th, 2007, 11:49 PM Also, lrt is not 10x cheaper than subways.

dispatching, signalling, stations, transfers, stock, maintenance and the extra electricity cost all cost money (when compared to overhangs, the third rail is a very inefficient way of transferring energy). When you add those up, it comes to 8 or 9 times the cost. I may have played it up a bit, but that’s exactly how the people who make the decisions are gonna tried to spin it. And they&apos;re not exactly wrong about it either.

When you build LRT, you do the road work, put the wires in and you&apos;re pretty much done with it other than the scheduled maintenance. A subway would require alot more extra background operations. splashflash December 9th, 2007, 01:26 AM dispatching, signalling,
If an lrt is worth anything it will have dispatching and signalling; otherwise it will be like the streetcars, little better than buses. LRTs have both, just as subways do, and those systems are expensive

stations, transfers,
I agree, if the stations are simply made. The Calgary LRT stations on the north lines are no cheaper to build than SRT stations, as they travel in the middle of fast paced arterials. If Toronto avoids this, and builds a glorified bus stop similar to the stations on St. Clair, costs will stay down.

stock,
If the stock is similar to the new streetcars, not at all. $5 M each, the price being heard in advance of final tendering, is very costly. The replacement subway cars from Bombardier, of which I was critical since there was no competitive bidding, look like a good deal, considering the number of people the carry compared to the proposed streetcars.


maintenance
If you want cheap maintenance, stick with buses, especially hybrids.

Station maintenance is costly for subway, but so is it for space lost (ie taxes not paid because of lost paid parking spaces or building space). Unfortunately, land taxes are lost to road space and rail space kept in the public domain; whereas, if buildings were there, taxes would be collected.


and the extra electricity cost all cost money (when compared to overhangs, the third rail is a very inefficient way of transferring energy).

Peanuts really. Electrical squirrel cage motors are similar, and the conductive path is not that different.

When you add those up, it comes to 8 or 9 times the cost.
You have to do better than that, and so should politicians who are managing a lot of taxpayer money.

It was rather ironic to see all the talk about having to shut down the Sheppard subway to save money. When it came down to the studies, not much at all would be saved. It was interesting that Sheppard was chosen in the first place, and I think that shows how much politics has been played.



When you build LRT, you do the road work, put the wires in and you&apos;re pretty much done with it other than the scheduled maintenance. A subway would require alot more extra background operations.

Again, this is all spin. With this logic, buses are what should be run since they are the cheapest to maintain and don&apos;t need any rails, wires or signalling systems. I am not at all against lrt, and I especially agree with you that Eglinton should be at the end of the queue, not the front, because it is essentially a subway. I am strongly against people, especially people who are highly paid, the chair of the TTC and should know better, making specious arguments with regard to public money. allurban December 9th, 2007, 10:59 AM I beg to differ. How do you figure they would not add pressure on Yonge? I totally do not see the logic in that statement.The point is that by going east and west from Yonge, the Eglinton and Sheppard subways would link both Yonge and Spadina.

Essentially, this would mean reduced pressure on Yonge and greater use of the Spadina line...

Sheppard perhaps could have run from Bayview to York University, (or as you suggested, a Finch line instead of Sheppard). Eglinton would have been very successful running from Bayview to Dufferin or Caledonia.

With these lines in place there would probably been more demand for GO Train connections, and a push for improved, higher frequency GO services...so that would also reduce some of the pressure on the Yonge line...by encouraging commuters to opt for GO Transit when traveling longer distances.

Had this been done, there would be 3 east-west subway lines, 2 north-south subway lines, and two north south GO lines offering frequent service...a complete network with lots of potential for expansion

This depends on their final destination. I don&apos;t think it would actually work that way given what current travel patterns look like. It becomes an argument of 2 transfers versus no transfers, which are riders going to opt for? TRZ December 9th, 2007, 01:04 PM Why would that be surprising? It was fielded as an alternative to the subway, which is holds very high in opinion to the people who lives in North York, Scarb and even Markham. Only it costs 10 times less, so it could actually happen. That&apos;s the logic behind all of TC&apos;s lines, but some do run into opposition, like Jane, and I think Don Mills might fight against some parts of it (based on the opposition of its busway to Castle Frank that got defeated by community opposition). The thing with Sheppard is that it has more space than other corridors along most of the route, since development is so low along that line east of Vic Park, with the exception of the Agincourt GO Station perhaps.

The TTC wants to push it through because it also saves them some embracement from the ATM useless Sheppard line. It&apos;s not going to help it become useful since the transfer remains. The TTC is trying to send a different message, I think, mainly that there should be no subway along this corridor.

And the province have little problem with it because they have to fund something anyways. There&apos;s an ignorant comment. They don&apos;t have to fund anything they don&apos;t feel like funding. The current provincial government has offered to fund all of Transit City as a package deal. The TTC could have put whatever plan they wanted and the province would have funded it in its MoveOntario2020 announcement. This was done as a vote-buying scheme, and it seems to be working. The TTC was actually expecting it to take a lot longer to get the province on board, they were totally caught off-guard. The province actually hasn&apos;t looked at the proposal in that much detail, I&apos;d wager. They just looked at the price tag and then assumed the city that did the planning behind the proposal had looked after the rest of the issues surrounding it, since McGuinty&apos;s job here is just to shovel the cash - the real work happens at the municipal and commission level. The province doesn&apos;t really care as long as they get elected thanks to the transit funding - and can cut the ribbon with photo ops. MoveOntario2020 basically said&quot;money is no issue&quot;.

The only people who would not like the Sheppard LRT are the ones who don’t get their lines built as early. But that&apos;s how the system works, you can&apos;t make everyone happy. Everyone is going to think that they&apos;re more important than the other guy, so what determines priority comes down to politics. Not in TC&apos;s case. The queue has been decided on strongest projections of ridership to the system, and what kinds of locations each corridor services, including connections to other operators. The relationship to the Official Plan is also weighed in, such as, for example, servicing&quot;priority neighborhoods&quot;. Sheppard is the only anamoly, as its queue number doesn&apos;t match these qualifiers. I will agree that in Sheppard&apos;s case, politics is playing into it, but for the others, its projections and other qualifiers deciding it, not politics. The funding has already been promised, so politics is not as important now.

The Eglinton line will never be prioritised just because of the cost of its underground section. The TTC would rather build twice the distance at grade at other locations, than build the Eglinton line at a near subway cost. It really doesn&apos;t matter how important the Eglinton line is or becomes, its cost pretty much dooms it to the end of the line. Thank you for proving you know absolutely nothing about the TTC. Eglinton is already the number one priority. Eglinton is by far the line of choice for pretty much everyone on TTC staff, and probably a majority of the commission from city council (since it cuts through a very large number of wards) and the reports prove that it is a ridership-cow waiting to be milked. The Eglinton Line has the strongest projections almost across the board. Its biggest failing is its cost, yes, but its projections are strong enough that its worth the investment. The TTC has been after a solution to Eglinton for a long time, as it has long been a priority across its entire length as needing higher order transit in previous (and current) studies of corridors.

First 3 should be Sheppard, Jane and Finch.

Eglinton, Jane, and Finch. Sheppard should be sent to at least 4th place, I&apos;d say 5th since the West Waterfront Line should also go ahead of Sheppard, but the TTC is eager to end the subway issue once and for all. TRZ December 9th, 2007, 01:16 PM Yes, transferring Sheppard to LRT wouldn&apos;t be easy but a hell of a lot cheaper than ext Sheppard to STC or west Spadina/ Jane.You might be surprised actually. Renovating an existing structure is more expensive than tearing down the old structure and building it new.
It could be started in the east first closing Don Mills and when that is transferred the LRT could run that far and so on. It wouldn&apos;t have to be done all at once. Hey genius, only at Sheppard-Yonge and Don Mills stations can trains turn around. Switches are not present at the rest of the in-between stations, IIRC, so that means yes, you do have to do it all at once.

Remember transferring Sheppard to LRT will be an added cost but extending to Spadina/Jane will be hundreds of millions cheaper than ext Sheppard subway all the way over to Jane.Except you haven&apos;t explained how the service disruption would be handled - which would be at least a year.

Also as said Sheppard subway will decrease in ridership as not only will be a bigger pain in the ass than it already is but also much of the traffic takes the line to get to the Yong line but that traaffic will be as heavy when they will be able to take the coming DonMills LRT to the Bloor line. Actually, the Don Mills LRT could become the Sheppard Subway&apos;s saving grace - far moreso than the Sheppard LRT.

Transferring the whole line from on end to Malvern to Jane to complete LRT would save a small fortune than extending the Sheppard line to Spadina little alone than Jane.
You&apos;re still underestimating both the costs of the conversion itself and the costs associated with a year&apos;s (or more) disruption of service - and the lost ridership that would result from that disruption. hkskyline December 10th, 2007, 07:16 AM TTC pair tell riders where to get off
Two staffers are the voices of automated system
National Post
7 December 2007

There are more than 13,000 bus stops in this city, and Cheryl Bome has said each and every one of them; some several times over.

Ms. Bome, a hardworking single mother from the west end, is one of the unlikely voices of the TTC&apos;s new $6.6-million automated stop announcement system. She can be heard on buses and streetcars across the city, letting riders know when to get off in a perfectly calm and measured tone--at least, by the time she was finished recording.

&quot;Fortunately, we have the opportunity to record them perhaps two or three times if I get tongue-tied,&quot;Ms. Bome said.

Exactly 11,202 bus stops and 1,347 streetcar stops have been geo-coded on the TTC&apos;s GPS system so far; the remaining are to be completed by February.

Many of the stops have the same names -- there&apos;s a Finch East stop on all the north and south routes that cross the road, for instance -- so Ms. Bome had only about 5,500 voice files to record. She has already done 4,669, which are in use on buses throughout the city.

The task was big, but, in keeping with the transit system&apos;s perpetual money crisis, the recording process wasn&apos;t a costly operation. Both Ms. Bome, a TTC administrative assistant, and Sue Bigioni, a TTC communications assistant who taped the stop announcements for the 70-station subway system, are regular TTC staffers plucked from the crowd after a little market testing.

Interestingly, the two women say their voices are so much alike that even people who know them sometimes mistake Ms. Bome&apos;s announcements for Ms. Bigioni&apos;s, and vice versa.

&quot;It&apos;s kind of funny that two independent focus groups picked voices that are very similar,&quot;Ms. Bigioni said.

The announcements were recorded in a makeshift studio in the office of the Talking Buses project manager, Steve Perron.

Some routes were more of a mouthful than others -- Lawrence East, for instance, has a whopping 207 stops.

Once recording was underway, the women realized many of Toronto&apos;s street names have multiple potential pronunciations.

One street Ms. Bome stumbled on was Fifeshire, a windy road in the area of York Mills and Bayview Avenue -- it turned out that the commonly preferred pronunciation of the second syllable was&quot;sure,&quot;not&quot;shire.&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s all in the pronunciation,&quot;Ms. Bome said.&quot;That&apos;s where a lot of the calls will come back in if you&apos;ve mispronounced a particular street name.&quot;

Trethewey Drive, a street near Black Creek Drive and Eglinton Avenue West, is technically pronounced&quot;Tretha-way,&quot;but is known to most Torontonians as&quot;Tre-thoo-ey.&quot;Ultimately, the decision was made to record the names the way they were commonly spoken by locals or radio and television traffic announcers.

&quot;You&apos;re not going to say &apos;Treth-a-way,&apos; because no one&apos;s going to know to get off at the stop,&quot;Ms. Bome said.

Though neither woman plans to make voice work a future career, Ms. Bigioni has already been offered a paid job recording the English announcements on a transit system in China. The Mayor of Chongqing noticed her voice while visiting Toronto, and contacted Ron Wandel, the city&apos;s manager of investment attraction, to find out how to contact her. The Chinese city is currently preparing scripts for her.

Programs to automate announcements began about two years ago at both the TTC&apos;s surface and subway systems, when the commission decided all stops should be announced regularly. The plan was sped up in July, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled the TTC had just 30 days to start announcing all surface route stops.

Ms. Bome says that with so many passengers listening in so many different places, it&apos;s hard not to get a little stage fright. But she has learned a few tricks through the recording process.

&quot;If I thought about the millions of people that might hear it, I would get nervous,&quot;Ms. Bome said.&quot;So I picture myself on the bus, and how clearly I would want to hear the voice announce the stop that I needed.&quot; UD2 December 10th, 2007, 08:11 AM Eglinton, Jane, and Finch. Sheppard should be sent to at least 4th place, I&apos;d say 5th since the West Waterfront Line should also go ahead of Sheppard, but the TTC is eager to end the subway issue once and for all.

I don&apos;t think the Eglinton line was included in the Move Ontario 2020 Quick Win head start EAs. I think the initial report said Sheppard, Jane and one more. I forgot which it was. But it shouldn&apos;t have been Eglinton.

I&apos;m sure the TTC sees it as important, heck I see it as important. But what determines first place? Certainly not TTC, they&apos;re not paying for the entire thing. And the Eglinton along with Down Valley West and York South raiding ridings (which the Eglinton line will eventually run through) already votes liberal.

However, Parkdale on the Jane line votes NDP. Zimmerman in Willowdale still holds a shaky lead in willowdale along the Finch line. The Don Valley East long the Don Mills line has been very safe liberal, and everything along the Sheppard line are Liberal. Morningside line has a couple iffy ridings and the rest are pretty much safely liberal as well.

I&apos;d think Jane Finch and Morning side are good vote winning start-ups for the next time around. And people&apos;s needs aside, it&apos;s not like Eglinton Lawrence and York South are going to vote Tory the next time around. And plus, if they do their things right they can probably hold on to Don Valley West for one more time around as well. After all, Tory did piss off the Jews with his catholic School thing.

I&apos;m sure public transit affects more than just one riding. But it affects the ridings that it passes through the most. TRZ December 10th, 2007, 08:38 AM I don&apos;t think the Eglinton line was included in the Move Ontario 2020 Quick Win head start EAs. I think the initial report said Sheppard, Jane and one more.

But it shouldn&apos;t have been Eglinton.But it IS Eglinton, these first three were the TTC&apos;s (and City Council&apos;s commissioners in particular) to decide, not Queen&apos;s Park&apos;s decision. I&apos;ve read the report you&apos;re referring to, I know.

I&apos;m sure the TTC sees it as important, heck I see it as important. But what determines first place? Certainly not TTC, they&apos;re not paying for the entire thing. They&apos;re not paying for it, true, but given the exceedingly large scope of MoveOntario2020, the province is simply not capable of trying to micromanage anything at this scale. They are going to be leaving it to the local level to make these decisions. They may prefer not to, I&apos;ll agree to that, but they are being forced to since it would require far too many resources among other problems for them to get too deeply involved themselves. They are being forced to do the smart thing and leave it to the municipal level and operator agencies to do the fine details, and we should be grateful it is playing out that way, because it results in the Eglinton Subway getting the green light as soon as possible.

However, Parkdale on the Jane line votes NDP. Zimmerman in Willowdale still holds a shaky lead in willowdale along the Finch line.

I&apos;m sure public transit affects more than just one riding. But it affects the ridings that it passes through the most.

7 December 2007
The Globe and Mail

Whether you&apos;re sweating in a packed nightclub, freezing at Nathan Phillips Square, or watching Dick Clark on TV with friends, if you pop too much bubbly on New Year&apos;s Eve, the TTC will get you home for free.

The Toronto Transit Commission voted in favour of a suggestion by chairman Adam Giambrone to offer free service after midnight on Dec. 31, as well as to extend the subway&apos;s hours to 4 a.m., in an effort to reduce drinking and driving.

The TTC last offered free New Year&apos;s admission in the late 1970s.

“Hopefully, what it will mean is that people will make the right decision when they are out having a good time on New Year&apos;s Eve, and decide to use the‘Better Way&apos; to get home,”Mr. Giambrone said.

He said the move will cost the cash-strapped transit agency–which had to raise fares by 15 cents this fall–only $80,000 to $90,000 in lost revenue.

(Last year, he said the idea wasn&apos;t possible, suggesting it would cost between $500,000 and $1-million.)

Mr. Giambrone added that the transit agency is now looking for corporate sponsors, observing that beer companies have picked up the tab for free New Year&apos;s Eve service for other transit agencies in the past.

The idea initially ran into resistance from the TTC&apos;s lawyer, Brian Leck, who argued that it might be necessary to charge a nominal fee, such as a penny, for legal reasons. For example, riders enter into a contract when they pay their fare, he said, giving the TTC power to eject people who are“unruly.”But the TTC later said all legal concerns were satisfied.

TTC chief general manager Gary Webster also said he doubted the move to free fares would result in a large number of new riders.

Many transit systems across the country, including Vancouver, Edmonton and Halifax, and other smaller bus services in the Toronto area, as well as GO Transit have offered free rides for New Year&apos;s Eve.

A man was taken to hospital in critical condition this afternoon after being severely beaten on the bus platform at the Sheppard subway&apos;s Don Mills station.

The man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was standing waiting for a bus at the station at about 3 p.m. when he was attacked by another man, said Toronto police Staff Sgt. David Simpkins.

The attacker robbed the victim, but police aren&apos;t yet saying what was taken.

The attacker then fled.

The victim was taken to hospital with critical injuries.

There have been no arrests.

Buses and trains are still operating at the station, which sits in North York at the far east end of the Sheppard subway line, TTC spokeswoman Marilyn Bolton said.

Buses are dropping passengers off outside the station, but aren&apos;t driving up to the bus platform while police investigate.

Anyone with information is asked to call police at 416-808-3300 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

Toronto Star
February 05, 2008

Commuter headaches will continue today as Kennedy Station remains closed in the wake of yesterdays train derailment.

Though repair crews worked throughout the night to open the section for todays rush hour, the damage proved too extensive, forcing officials to keep the line closed for at least for the morning.

Buses will continue to shuttle passengers between the Warden and Kennedy stations, but commuters are being asked to factor the additional time into their trip.

Danny Nicholson, public affairs officer for the TTC, said its not known how long the station will remain closed, adding everything is being done to return subway service.

Service at the station was shut down around 1 a.m. Monday when a train was beginning its last westbound run along the Bloor-Danforth line. It was changing directions at the Kennedy subway station when the last car of a six-car train tipped off the track inside the tunnel.

Although it isnt known what caused the accident, TTC Chair Adam Giambrone speculated yesterday something being dragged along the line was possibly to blame.

He said a section of the cars undercarriage or a metal ceiling tile caught up underneath the train could have forced the car off the track.

The leaning car damaged the interior wall of the tunnel as well as switches, signals and portions of the track.

The train was travelling at a slow speed and none of the four riders, or two crew members, were injured.

With service stopped between Kennedy and Warden stations yesterday, the TTC scrambled 30 buses to shuttle passengers between the stations adding, on average, an extra 30 minutes to the commute. Kennedy station is a busy stop along the line as it connects the Bloor-Danforth line to the Scarborough RT and provides access to GO Transit.

With files from Tess Kalinowski Skybean February 6th, 2008, 03:17 AM It&apos;s a shame that such a critical station would be shut down for two days in a row. Buses simply cannot makeup for a missing subway train. In effect the whole system was slowed because of this incident due to buses being rerouted to ferry passengers traveling past the derailment.

I&apos;m disappointed that maintenance crews couldn&apos;t catch this... but then again, I&apos;m not surprised at all.&quot;Maintenance&quot;is obviously kept at a bare minimum on the TTC. There&apos;s garbage floating around the tracks like strewn newspaper, water bottles and rodents running around the tracks all of the time. Broken escalators are routinely left for&quot;repair&quot;for 3 months in already antiquated stations which were not designed for the passenger flows that exist today.

If Toronto had longer buses, then I&apos;m sure they could have handled this much better. It would have been also good if they ran extra GO trains from Kennedy GO, or at least allowed passengers to ride from Kennedy to Main St or Union for a TTC fare. On the plus side, I&apos;m sure waiting for a bus at Kennedy station was not very long, to say the least ;)

As for your comments on maintenance of the TTC, it isn&apos;t perfect, but it is MUCH better than many major subway systems. Mice are gonna run along the tracks of any system that runs through an underground tunnel, and would it make you feel better if they shut down the tracks several times a day to clean garbage on them? Escalators though, there is no excuse and their policies on their upkeep need to be revised. Same with the installation of elevators (unless the TTC is trying to break a record for the slowest installation of an elevator).

Bottom line...Toronto subways are crap.

The wait would be long, actually, because you&apos;ll have to wait a few buses to pass before you can get on. The SRT lets passengers build up faster than buses can haul them away. Bigger buses would not solve the problem either, btw. Having Stouffville trains stop at Danforth (usually they don&apos;t) would have helped a lot, IMO, even if they didn&apos;t let them ride for a TTC fare. However, GO might not be able to handle the loads either due to their lower frequencies and the fact that the trains are full at Kennedy already since it is the last stop before Union on that line. The platform for the GO train would be too small to accomodate the piling up of SRT users. Skybean February 8th, 2008, 02:19 AM As for your comments on maintenance of the TTC, it isn&apos;t perfect, but it is MUCH better than many major subway systems.


There are many major subway systems that are better than the TTC. For a city of this size, the TTC has a small system with many things that need to be fixed. Ridership will increase as more immigrants move into the GTA. Coupled with the prohibitive costs of gasoline and car ownership, transit will be only viable option for many people. The problems with the TTC will only continue become compounded unless some funding is provided with a change of management.


would it make you feel better if they shut down the tracks several times a day to clean garbage on them?


How about preventing people from throwing foreign objects onto the track all together? There`s obviously no funding for it, but platform screen doors are in common use with many other major subway systems. I realize the TTC is strapped for cash since the province and feds are not willing to pay but with increasing ridership and fares I don`t see why we are still having these problems with routine maintenance.

Buses are only a band-aid solution. They&apos;re slow and move very small volumes of passengers compared to rail, and subject to traffic delays with other vehicles on the road.

Unfortunately, building a massive network of subways seems to be a pipe dream today, if simply due to the costs involved. Buses are not THAT bad though. Most TTC bus routes have more than significant enough frequency and speed to be a realistic alternative to driving. If they would implement more limited stop/express service, dedicated bus lanes, traffic light priority, and larger and nicer buses, then more people would want to ride the bus and not simply&quot;put up&quot;with it.

Yonge south of Bloor, possibly even south of Eglinton, the system is in danger of failing under too much pressure without a DRL running from Keele to Greenwood via downtown.

That&apos;s why we need a phase 2 for TC almost immediately after phase 1 is complete:

Jane should be redirected towards the Weston Sub and designed to be upgraded to subway if necessary. Initially it stops at Dundas West but later should extend to Exhibition.

Goes without saying that Don Mills should be extended south to meet the the Lakeshore LRT (which should be upgraded to real LRT), and also be designed to convert to subway if necessary.

Massive expansion of Union Loop.

Sheppard should be converted to subway. Just go for it, and stop this nonsense about transfering again.

Redirect more suburbanites to the Spadina Line (and Spadina should only be extended to a future bus terminal at Steeles W)

GO Rail MUST be upgraded to S-Bahn service, so that someone in Etobicoke can go to Kipling, wait a maximum of 15 minutes (10 minutes peak hours), and get downtown in 15 minutes. Someone in Richmond Hill can get to Langstaff and get downtown easily, and this should alleviate the overcrowding at Finch. Same thing with Scarborough and the Markham line.

Once those are taken, congestion on the Yonge should decrease dramatically. TRZ February 10th, 2008, 03:46 PM first of all BD is just a massive feeder line. Only like 20-25% use it as a crosstown.

Sheppard is a feeder line as well and so would Eglinton...

Meaning its great and all but really Yonge is crowded now, I can&apos;t fathom what would happen if you start getting like 20-25% more traffic from more traffic on the BD line that feeds into Yonge (don mills, Jane would feed on to BD) and the added traffic from the Eglinton, Sheppard, Finch LRT&apos;s onto Yonge.

I agree, that&apos;s why the DRL would be excellent at taking the existing load from Kennedy to Greenwood and Kipling to HighPark off of the Donlands-DundasWest portion of the B-D and take them straight downtown (I&apos;m talking about a one-seat, no transfer, using the existing Wye at Greenwood yard and a new Wye between Keele and Dundas West, using space from the old Vincent Yard). If the same DRL is extended as a branch service north of B-D, then it can also take Eglinton&apos;s loads, even Sheppard if one uses it to create a loop line.

Sheppard Subway should not be extended to STC, it will only make the feeder problem into Yonge worse. hkskyline February 13th, 2008, 11:23 AM Subway derailment sparks parts redesign
February 13, 2008
Toronto Star

The TTC is replacing two of the parts on its entire fleet of 126 H6 subway cars following last week&apos;s train derailment near Kennedy station.

A safety pin has been redesigned and a heavy metal link–both of which failed on the derailed car–will be replaced across the H6 fleet within the next four months. The H6 represents less than one-third of all subway cars in the TTC fleet.

The move follows an accident investigation that showed the failure of the link allowed the car&apos;s torque arm to push down on the safety pin, loosening it, so that the arm fell and dragged along the track bed, derailing the train.

The entire H6 fleet, which undergoes regular monthly inspections, was reinspected following the accident and no problems were found, said TTC chair Adam Giambrone.

The parts replacement is precautionary and doesn&apos;t indicate any systemic concern or any threat to public safety on the subway, he said.

But&quot;clearly, two individual systems failed and this shouldn&apos;t have happened,&quot;he said.&quot;We&apos;ll continue to try to figure out why they both occurred at exactly the same time.&quot;

None of the six people on the train, including two crew members, was injured when the last car lifted off the track west of Kennedy station. The derailment occurred Feb. 1 as the train was heading west on its last run, around 1 a.m.

&quot;These aren&apos;t derailments where the whole train falls over. The speeds are lower because they&apos;re going through switches. And they don&apos;t fall off the track. One of the wheels comes off the track; that causes some damage to the tunnels, and people are not injured,&quot;Giambrone explained.

In 1995, an axle broke, derailing an almost new H6 subway car near Finch station. No one was hurt in that accident, either, Giambrone said. The broken axle was called a fluke at the time. The TTC would have been more concerned about last week&apos;s derailment had it been unable to find a cause.

&quot;We found what it is and that allows us to deal with it,&quot;he said.

Had there been serious questions about the reason the car derailed, the TTC would have called on the American Public Transit Association to help it investigate, Giambrone said.

The H6 cars aren&apos;t made any more. Built in Thunder Bay, they are about halfway through their anticipated 30-year lifespan and have proved extremely reliable overall, say TTC officials.

There are fewer than 100 of the TTC&apos;s oldest H5 cars in service. Its newest, some 372 T1 cars, were purchased from Bombardier in 1991. Delivery of another new generation of subway cars will begin next year. TRZ February 14th, 2008, 07:23 PM There are fewer than 100 of the TTC&apos;s oldest H5 cars in service.

Those new gen cars were in a quantity of 234 or something, IIRC. After the H5s are gone, the H6s are next to be replaced. Although not all H6s are going to get replaced since there are too many in the fleet to be replaced by the new order, this new safety pin is only going to see a year or two of service. At least its cheap. But you&apos;d wonder why this never happened before if this fault exists across the fleet. Kinda weird, but whatever.

because it probabley has a very low probability of occuring, and that probability becomes larger with age.

For all we know, this type of incident will probably never take place again for another 20 years. But because TTC is a bureaucracy, decisions arn&apos;t made on a scale of probability, rather deniability is the main drive behind the choices that are made.

afterall, nobody wants to take the responsibility if this does happen to occur again. hkskyline February 18th, 2008, 07:01 AM TTC uploading worth a long look
16 February 2008
The Toronto Star

Premier Dalton McGuinty&apos;s musings this week about having the province take over the TTC generated the usual backlash from Toronto City Hall. Despite that opposition, a takeover may be in the best interest of transit riders. It is worth finding out.

Critics have some valid concerns in resisting a transfer of the TTC to Metrolinx, formerly known as the Greater Toronto Transportation Authority. Its job is to co-ordinate commuter services across the GTA and Hamilton. The critics worry about losing local autonomy and fear the TTC could be starved of funds in favour of promoting transit in the 905 area. Without a proper and detailed study, however, there is no way of knowing if those fears are valid.

And the advantages of putting Metrolinx in charge of the TTC might well outweigh all the drawbacks.

While uploading the TTC to this regional transit authority remains in the realm of speculation, it has obviously gained some attention at Queen&apos;s Park. To prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the idea, the provincial government should put together a task force made up of Metrolinx officials, provincial transportation experts, and municipal staff from Toronto and other GTA cities.

McGuinty is correct in noting that transit in many other large urban centres is run on a region-wide basis rather than through a patchwork of local fiefdoms. Vancouver&apos;s successful TransLink authority, for example, steers policy and direction for transportation development in 22 communities. It even has power to charge tolls and set parking fees.

Strict transit boundaries are becoming a thing of the past. The TTC is already working on pushing a subway route outside Toronto by extending its Spadina line into Vaughan. The province is proposing to extend the Yonge line to Markham.

An overview is needed. With Ontario&apos;s Golden Horseshoe facing deepening gridlock, and as more commuters make a daily trek between cities, a case could be made that it would be best to run all GTA transit through Metrolinx rather than nine separate and narrowly focused systems. Or it may make better sense to pass only the control of subway lines to Metrolinx, and leaving buses and streetcars with the TTC. These options warrant serious study.

Toronto&apos;s bottom line would benefit from having the province lift the burden of the TTC from the municipal budget. Local taxpayers can expect to spend more than $200 million in subsidies for the TTC this year. Eliminating that annual cost would go a long way to putting this city on a secure financial footing.

More important than any budget benefit, however, is finding ways to improve the delivery of public transit to riders in Toronto and across the GTA. With that in mind, we need a serious study of the uploading of the TTC and other GTA public transit systems under the umbrella of Metrolinx. That might ultimately prove the better way. hkskyline February 18th, 2008, 11:27 AM Ontario&apos;s unwise reach
18 February 2008
The Globe and Mail

Torontonians are fond of bemoaning their city&apos;s public transit system, with some justification. For a system that serves the fifth-largest city in North America, the Toronto Transit Commission is badly underdeveloped. But a trial balloon floated by Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty would do little to solve this problem. If anything, it would give Torontonians more reason to complain.

Last week, Mr. McGuinty suggested that the TTC, currently controlled by the city, might eventually be taken over by the province. The aim would be an integrated regional system across the Greater Toronto Area, presumably under the watch of Metrolinx, a nascent provincial agency currently charged with mapping out a transportation plan for the area.“If you look around at most large urban centres there tends to be a larger regional body that takes responsibility for these kinds of things, so that from the perspective of a user it is perfectly seamless,”Mr. McGuinty said.

That his musings would meet with an outcry from municipal councillors, including TTC chair Adam Giambrone, was predictable, but they have good reason for being territorial. Seamlessness could be achieved simply by making provincial funding contingent upon the TTC&apos;s co-operating with the agency (or agencies) running public transit in surrounding cities. Mr. McGuinty&apos;s more drastic approach would instead take Toronto transit decisions out of the hands of those closest to the ground–councillors familiar with the system and answerable to its riders–and place them instead with a less accountable agency under the watch of a provincial government that already neglects Toronto&apos;s needs. That&apos;s hardly a recipe for success.

For all of the criticism directed at the TTC, its failings are less attributable to municipal mismanagement than to a lack of funding. The cash-strapped city, still feeling the effects of municipal downloading under the previous provincial government and unable to raise enough revenues itself, does what it can by investing in relatively minor upgrades, such as the service expansion on bus and streetcar routes announced last week. But it depends on the province to fund more ambitious endeavours, such as a much-needed expansion of the city&apos;s skeletal subway system, and until recently there has been little provincial will to do so.

It seems almost cruel that, having finally awoken to public transit needs with his MoveOntario 2020 plan–which will direct $11.5-billion toward Greater Toronto Area transit projects ($17.5-billion if the federal government comes on board)–Mr. McGuinty now seeks to deny the city its role in putting that money to good use. The Premier is only complicating matters by trying to reinvent the wheel. KGB February 19th, 2008, 08:11 AM Then the bus fleet is aging, and needs to be overhauled. The average age of a bus is over 15 years.

Perhaps you should look at current info....most of the TTC&apos;s bus fleet is less than 5 years old, and when the city takes delivery of its new buses this year, the fleet will be essentially all new.

And those&quot;old&quot;buses you were refering to, were actually completely rebuilt, so much different than if they had just been running since they were first built.

Looks like your numbers are very outdated, and not in-line with today&apos;s reality. Unless you tell me the TTC has brought in hundreds of new buses of late to reduce the fleet&apos;s average age, you&apos;re a good 10 years behind the stats I&apos;m finding in the papers. Rebuilding an old bus to force its life to be extended beyond its designed shelf life is certainly not something to be proud of, and is definitely not a permanent solution to the aging problem.

Even if the new orders of some 470 buses did come in per the article below, given the fleet is 1500-strong, the average age would not be able to move down to anywhere near 5 years. It&apos;s mathematically impossible.

TTC wants $136M to buy buses
&apos;Desperate need&apos; for 250 vehicles Commissioners vote tomorrow
15 July 2003
The Toronto Star

A&quot;desperate&quot;TTC trying to catch up from years of neglect is asking the city for $136 million to buy 250 new buses to replenish its aging fleet.

&quot;There&apos;s really no backing off from that number,&quot;Rick Ducharme, chief general manager of the Toronto Transit Commission, said yesterday in an interview.&quot;If we don&apos;t get it, then there will be definitely cuts in service.

&quot;This is critical decision time.&quot;

The TTC&apos;s commissioners will meet tomorrow to vote on Ducharme&apos;s request and to get an update on streetcar line repairs, which create traffic jams every summer at key intersections.

About 65 per cent of the current streetcar rails are rated as fair to poor and, at some spots - marked with red flags overhead - streetcars must slow to 10 km/h because the track is so poor.

&quot;The whole gridlock issue, the lack of funding, is catching up to us,&quot;said Ducharme.&quot;There&apos;s two critical issues going on, the fixing of the track and the buses I have to buy.&quot;

A political emphasis on upgrading the subway system - largely due to the 1995 collision of two subway trains that killed three passengers - insulated it from budget cuts.

But that, in turn, led to neglect of streetcars and buses during the late 1990s, when both the city and province - which used to fund 75 per cent of the TTC&apos;s capital needs - were looking to trim budgets.

The TTC was repeatedly forced to put off buying new buses, and today has one of the oldest fleets in North America. The average age of its 1,500 buses is 14.5 years, with some older than 24 years, compared to Ottawa&apos;s average age of 10 years, GO&apos;s nine, Mississauga&apos;s eight, and seven in the United States. In the U.S., the federal government is far more involved in local transit than Ottawa and funds bus renewal for cities.

A bus is designed to last about 12 years.

A TTC staff memo says the commission is&quot;in desperate need&quot;of the new buses&quot;at the earliest possible date.&quot;

In 2001, the City of Toronto approved the purchase of 220 buses, 39 fewer than required, from Orion Bus Industries of Mississauga.

All those buses will be on the road by the end of 2004.

But because they bought fewer than needed in 2001, the TTC has fewer spare buses to call upon in case of breakdowns.

If approved, the next order of 250 low-floor, clean-diesel Orion VII buses would be delivered in 2005, replacing 25-year-old GMC New Look buses and 18-year-old Flyers.

&quot;Because of the budget crunch, they forced us to back off and get the 220,&quot;said Ducharme.&quot;I warned them back then all you&apos;re doing is pushing it back a year or two. You can&apos;t do that again. We&apos;re going to need 250 ... because it&apos;s very clear there are no extra buses. We&apos;re cutting ourselves very tight even with that number.&quot;

Councillor Howard Moscoe, TTC chair, said he expects his fellow commissioners to approve Ducharme&apos;s request, although he can&apos;t be sure where the money will come from. The city would be on the hook for it unless it can convince the province and Ottawa to split the bill three ways.

&quot;We can&apos;t run service without buses,&quot;said Moscoe.&quot;We managed to extend the life of our buses beyond what is reasonable. We&apos;re running buses that are beyond 24 years old. There comes a point where you can only stretch them so far.&quot;I have faith that somebody, somewhere will come through for us in the end. Beyond that kind of hope, what else can we do?&quot;

As for the streetcars, new technology means rails laid today last 15 years, 10 years longer than before, and streetcar noise is substantially reduced. Moscoe said the TTC can only lay new track, however, when the city is rebuilding streets.

But the amount of work scheduled to be done over the next five years is three times the work that was done in the &apos;90s.

&quot;We&apos;ve accelerated (improvements) dramatically from what we were doing in the &apos;90s,&quot;said Ducharme.&quot;We&apos;ve fallen behind and you can&apos;t look back as to who should or shouldn&apos;t have done it. Money was tight and decisions were made and we are where we are.&quot;

But he cautioned the work will never really end.

&quot;Everyone keeps thinking &apos;state of good repair,&apos; that someday you get there. You have to understand, you never get there. That&apos;s what state of good repair is: preventive maintenance. If you back off, then you&apos;re in real trouble.&quot; KGB February 20th, 2008, 04:33 AM Looks like your numbers are very outdated, and not in-line with today&apos;s reality.

No, it looks like you&apos;re the one who&apos;s outdated (the 2003 date on your cut and paste might be a big hint you should have noticed).

The TTC already recieved 482 new buses by 2005...another 230 in 2006...can&apos;t remember how many in 2007, and is due to recieve about 500 more this year.

Not only are they receiving enough to retire old buses, it will leave them with about 100 extra for added service.

From a report for Transport Canada in March 2005,&quot;the TTC&apos;s average fleet age is now 14 years, and the average age of TTC high floor buses is 18 years.&quot;

http://www.tc.gc.ca/Pol/en/Report/Transit/Transit2.htm

That 14 year figure whould include all the 2001 Orion bus orders (220 buses) as all those vehicles were delivered by end of 2004. In addition, the 14 year figure would include the first 17 deliveries of the 2005 Orion option extension order. A further 249 buses were delivered in 2005. For the Feb. 05 Orion order which included hybrids and diesels, a total of 230 buses were delivered in 2006 with 100 more in 2007. Another extension resulted in 220 more hybrid deliveries in 2007.

2002-6 Annual Reports (with fleet size and order information)
http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/schedules/service_reports.htm#annualreport

The 14 year figure should have been end of 2004. With a fleet size of 1502 at 2004-end, the total vehicle years is 21,028 (1502 x 14).

At end of 2005 there were 1491 buses, so add 1491 vehicle years.
At end of 2006, there were 1543 buses, so add 1543 vehicle years.

Total vehicle years as at end of 2006 = 24,062. Divide that by the # of buses = 1543. Average bus age = 15.6 years.

So even with the additional buses from new orders, the average bus age still is a good 15 years.

Your 482 figure by 2005 likely relates to the Orion order from 2001 (1 delivered in 2002, 100 delivered in 2003, and 119 delivered in 2004) and subsequent option extension in 2005 (17 delivered in 2004, 237 delivered in 2005, and an extra 12 delivered in 2005) which totals 486 buses. All these deliveries have been factored in my calculation.

Your 230 figure matches the Feb. 05 Orion order, whereby 150 hybrids and 80 diesels were delivered in 2006. A further 320 were slated to come online in 2007, but given the fleet is 1500-strong, could this order drastically reduce the average age from 15.6 to 5? Perhaps you can calculate how that is mathematically possible. TRZ February 20th, 2008, 02:20 PM hkskyline, look at the dates you post and look at the order dates referred to by KGB.

It&apos;s called&quot;chronology&quot;and&quot;basic mathematics&quot;. This replacement plan has been on the TTC&apos;s&quot;to-do&quot;list and long-term capital budget for a decade.

Hate to say this, but between the improved service, new bus looks (with more comfortable seats), and more, Mr. Giambrone has done a good job with the TTC. KGB February 21st, 2008, 01:54 AM So even with the additional buses from new orders, the average bus age still is a good 15 years.

Nowhere from the annual reports do I see an expected delivery for 500 buses. The annual reports indicate 140 new deliveries in 2008.

I see nothing wrong with using a 2005 article quoting a likely 2004 year-end number and then calculating the present average age based on fleet numbers that are publically available and disclosed year-by-year.

The Toronto Transit Commission plans to unveil $22-million in improvements to bus and streetcar service tomorrow, the TTCs chairman says.
It is quite impressive. There are major service improvements across the city, Adam Giambrone said today.
The TTC has already announced it will add 400 extra drivers to its staff and 500 new buses to its fleet this year, largely to relieve overcrowding and to extend or modify several bus routes.
At tomorrows 10 a.m. announcement, the TTC will detail exactly where it plans to beef up service and which routes it intends to extend or alter, Mr. Giambrone said.
There have been a whole bunch of requests for changes of bus routes that have been made over the last couple of years that we have been unable to deal with, he said. So now there will be changes to routes.
The $22-million for new service is already included in the TTCs proposed 2008 operating budget.
The service improvements will take effect next week.

Yet it will not reduce the average age of the bus to the 5 years you alluded to, even after the hundreds of new buses from the 2001 and 2005 orders still kept the average age at 15.

Besides, the 2008 deliveries haven&apos;t taken place in full yet, so the average age will not even affected at all until end of 2008 numbers are compiled. These are future deliveries to be executed this year.

Given at the end of 2006, which is where my numbers come from if you read my calculations, these 2008 deliveries have not taken place, hence they would not be considered. Obviously 2006 is before 2008.

So after all this, you&apos;re trying to compare my 2006 year-end average with your hypothetical average assuming at the end of 2008 all these buses will be delivered. Take a look and see whether you&apos;re comparing apples to apples.

The 2007 Annual Report has not yet been issued, hence there is no way an accurate average can be computed as final deliveries cannot be confirmed. There&apos;s a very obvious logical error trying to mix actual numbers with estimates to compute an average.

Looks like you can&apos;t do math too well. TRZ February 21st, 2008, 03:59 AM ^^hkskyline, by 2007, over 1000 of the 1500-something fleet is 5-6 years old or younger.

KGB ssiguy2 February 21st, 2008, 06:16 AM I know little about the TTC fleet so I will avoid that argument instead I have a question.
How many articulates does the TTC have and are any of the buses arriving this year articulated? hkskyline February 21st, 2008, 06:55 AM ^^hkskyline, by 2007, over 1000 of the 1500-something fleet is 5-6 years old or younger. Even if you assume the rest of the 500 or so in the fleet are 30 years old, the average would be 13 years today, not over 15 today as you mistakenly claim, and a year from now, the age will be in the neighborhood 3 years with the 500 new buses. The math is very clear on this. The replacement orders&apos; quantity are not in dispute, are they? You should back down, you&apos;ve been proven wrong.

The number I got is as of end of 2006, which is the most recent Annual Report is available. Even end of 2007 numbers cannot be computed since that Annual Report has not yet been released.

Only 230 new buses came online in 2006, whereas from the order expectations, 320 more buses would come online in 2007 if all goes well. 249 new buses came online in 2005. So you are right to point out that in the past 5 years, over 1000 new buses have been brought into service. However, the average age will only drop drastically if all these new buses replaced old buses, meaning it&apos;s a 1:1 swap. 1 new bus would result in 1 bus being removed from the system. I doubt that has happened in reality, which is why I don&apos;t forsee a huge drastic drop in the average bus age.

Even if the best case scenario does happen, that a 1:1 swap does occur, there still remains another 500 buses from the old fleet that need to be phased out in order for the average age to drop anywhere near 5 years. So far I haven&apos;t seen any evidence that there is a 1:1 swap to make this best case scenario anywhere near true. The best case scenario would see the average age drop to about 7.8.

In fact, my 15 includes keeping the old buses, as there is no evidence so far to suggest how much bus scrapping is taking place, hence it is logically flawed to assume the best case scenario without appropriate evidence. That mathematical computation is still correct.

You can&apos;t remove the old buses from the computation if they&apos;re still there. And the computation including the new buses shows that the average will drop, but the pool of aged buses will still keep the average fairly steady. You need a number of years for these new additions to flush out into the average numbers. That&apos;s what the mathematical average is about. It never rises as quickly as the population and it falls slowly in the opposite direction.

Time to hit the books again to learn about the concept of an average. hkskyline February 21st, 2008, 06:57 AM Oh fer christ&apos;s sake.

There appears to be so many flaws in your logic, it&apos;s hard to tell where you went wrong. You aren&apos;t aware of how many new buses there are, and obviously haven&apos;t factored in that the old buses are retired, and logically no longer affect the&quot;average&quot;.




KGB
There&quot;appears&quot;or there&quot;are&quot;? Your uncertainty and inability to back up your statement contradicts with your assertion that there are&quot;so many flaws&quot;yet it&apos;s&quot;hard to tell where it went wrong&quot;.

If people can&apos;t rely on the number of new buses being brought into service according to statistics published on the TTC website and audited by external auditors, then I wonder how much credibility we should put in your statements.

Perhaps you can shed some light on the retirement rates to make some sense as to why the old buses should be taken out of the picture? KGB February 21st, 2008, 07:18 AM See...I told you he will tap-dance.

Dude...OF COURSE they retire old buses as new ones arrive. New buses are to replace old buses....not to increase the size of the fleet. By the time the 500 newest buses arrive this year, the entire fleet will only be about 100 buses more than it was before, to cover added service.

You&apos;re the self-proclaimed math expert...if the TTC has already received over a thousand new buses over the past 5 years or so, and if they didn&apos;t replace old buses, then the fleet should be 1000 buses bigger. Is it? No, it isn&apos;t. The fleet required always remains around 1500-1600.

New buses are arriving constantly...old buses are constantly being retired. Relying on years-old annual reports doesn&apos;t help the current situation, especially when so much is happening.




KGB TRZ February 21st, 2008, 07:39 AM KGB: Point taken :doh:

So you are right to point out that in the past 5 years, over 1000 new buses have been brought into service. However, the average age will only drop drastically if all these new buses replaced old buses, meaning it&apos;s a 1:1 swap. 1 new bus would result in 1 bus being removed from the system. I doubt that has happened in reality, which is why I don&apos;t forsee a huge drastic drop in the average bus age. Well, what do you know about Toronto? It was a 1:1 swap, it is the main point of the entire program.

Even if the best case scenario does happen, that a 1:1 swap does occur, there still remains another 500 buses from the old fleet that need to be phased out in order for the average age to drop anywhere near 5 years. So far I haven&apos;t seen any evidence that there is a 1:1 swap to make this best case scenario anywhere near true. The best case scenario would see the average age drop to about 7.8.It&apos;s 1:1. Like I said, the average at 2007 would be 13 or less (likely less, I&apos;m not sure all the remaining 500 buses not yet replaced are 30 years old). The last 500 are coming in this year, and that will bring the age down to closer to 3, not 5.

In fact, my 15 includes keeping the old buses, as there is no evidence so far to suggest how much bus scrapping is taking place, hence it is logically flawed to assume the best case scenario without appropriate evidence. That mathematical computation is still correct.No it isn&apos;t, because you fail to take into account that the TTC fleet size is not changing as these buses come in - check the fleet size records in all years for the past decade. The fleet size actually goes down, not up, as they are forced to retire some buses that cannot be rebuilt before there are any replacements for them. You didn&apos;t bother to check the fleet sizes per year, so what are you basing your ASSUMPTIONS on for keeping the old buses which has never been the case and simply a foolish act on your part? In 2007, worst case, it would be around 13. Over 15, no, only in your imagination with bad math.

You can&apos;t remove the old buses from the computation if they&apos;re still there.True. But they&apos;re not there in reality, so yes, you not only CAN remove them, you MUST remove them for your calculations to be anywhere near accurate.
It never rises as quickly as the population and it falls slowly in the opposite direction.Sure it does, if you get rid of all the old buses as the TTC is in fact doing! Do your research.

Time to hit the books again to learn about the concept of an average.

KGB


If you check the 2006 Annual Report, your argument falls apart immediately. The bus fleet actually increased from 1491 in 2005 to 1543 in 2006, and is different from the 2004 and 2003 figures as well. So if it was a buy and retire program strictly speaking, then there is no way the fleet size could&apos;ve had that variability over the past few years when there were new deliveries year after year.

In fact, I&apos;d be very surprised if it&apos;s a 1:1 swap. What likely happened was they retired some of the very old buses, and kept some of the less old ones in place (ie. buy 500, retire 300, keep 200). Hence, the fleet increased and was able to expand service. Otherwise, had every new bus resulted in a retirement, there is no way the TTC can expand service as the total number of new buses would stay exactly the same. This&quot;reality&quot;you are proclaiming doesn&apos;t match what is actually happening on the news.

There goes your points ...



KGB: Point taken :doh:

Well, what do you know about Toronto? It was a 1:1 swap, it is the main point of the entire program.

It&apos;s 1:1. Like I said, the average at 2007 would be 13 or less (likely less, I&apos;m not sure all the remaining 500 buses not yet replaced are 30 years old). The last 500 are coming in this year, and that will bring the age down to closer to 3, not 5.

Time to do some research before making your points.

Fleet Sizes per 2006 TTC Annual Report
2006 - 1543
2005 - 1491
2004 - 1502
2003 - 1489
2002 - 1468
2001 - 1480
2000 - 1468

So your argument that the fleet size is actually going down is not valid at all. In fact, the trend points to an increasing direction, and as of 2006 there were more buses than ever before.

In fact, my calculations incorporated the 2005 and 2006 fleet sizes to compute the 2006 year-end average. In case you don&apos;t remember what I wrote, here it is again :

The 14 year figure should have been end of 2004. With a fleet size of 1502 at 2004-end, the total vehicle years is 21,028 (1502 x 14).

At end of 2005 there were 1491 buses, so add 1491 vehicle years.
At end of 2006, there were 1543 buses, so add 1543 vehicle years.


Quite easy to understand how new orders are affecting the fleet size movements over the years. Hence. it is logically incorrect to blindly remove all the old buses from the aging analysis. There definitely is no 1:1 swap to retire the old fleet. The numbers tell that quite balatantly. Try to learn the concept of differences and ratios. :)


I&apos;m not at all surprised at this kind of reaction. Full of inconsistencies and weaknesses. I suggest learning more and researching from what the TTC has published to better understand how their fleet modernization is structured, and to learn some more math. This should be basic stuff. TRZ February 21st, 2008, 05:27 PM Time to do some research before making your points.Yeah, you being so smart and all that, you go ahead and prove my point for me (bravo!):

Fleet Sizes per 2006 TTC Annual Report
2006 - 1543 +50
2005 - 1491 -11
2004 - 1502 +13
2003 - 1489 +21
2002 - 1468 -12
2001 - 1480 +12
2000 - 1468

So your argument that the fleet size is actually going down is not valid at all. In fact, the trend points to an increasing direction, and as of 2006 there were more buses than ever before.No, it did go down some years, and that was the point I was making, it means that they are losing more buses than they can replace. How many buses arrived for 2005? 249? So if they are keeping the old ones, how do they net lose 11 in the total fleet? Yeah, exactly, it is because you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, like we&apos;ve been telling you. Same goes for 2002.


Quite easy to understand how new orders are affecting the fleet size movements over the years. Hence. it is logically incorrect to blindly remove all the old buses from the aging analysis. There definitely is no 1:1 swap to retire the old fleet. The numbers tell that quite balatantly. Try to learn the concept of differences and ratios. :)You can&apos;t do math, it is as simple as that. You do not simply add the number of vehicle years in the one year to the previous year, you are incompetent. You are completely neglecting the new orders that arrive replacing the old ones that retire, thus your numbers are totally useless, and as a bonus, you get to look like an idiot. See, in ratio, if you have 1502 buses in 2004 and then 1491 buses in 2005 when 249 new arrivals debut, how many buses retired? Yeah, that&apos;s right wise one, learn rate and ratio, it means 260 of the oldest in the fleet are gone and your numbers are total fabrications from your little fantasy land.


I&apos;m not at all surprised at this kind of reaction. Full of inconsistencies and weaknesses. I suggest learning more and researching from what the TTC has published to better understand how their fleet modernization is structured, and to learn some more math. This should be basic stuff.

Indeed it is basic stuff, it is amazing you screw it up with such a blantant oversight and incapacity to account for the concept of&quot;replacements&quot;that obviously do take place by the very fact that the fleet numbers go DOWN as new buses arrive. What more proof could you possibly need? Also, don&apos;t waste your time trying to act like you know anything about the TTC, we are Toronto natives and transit advocates too, we know far better than you&apos;ll ever know, there&apos;s just no comparison, you cannot possibly compete. The only weaknesses and inconsistencies are coming from you, as only your math has been proven wrong here... repeatedly I might add (you do remember&quot;addition&quot;, don&apos;t you?). KGB February 22nd, 2008, 01:32 AM If you check the 2006 Annual Report, your argument falls apart immediately. The bus fleet actually increased from 1491 in 2005 to 1543 in 2006, and is different from the 2004 and 2003 figures as well. So if it was a buy and retire program strictly speaking, then there is no way the fleet size could&apos;ve had that variability over the past few years when there were new deliveries year after year.


Well, first of all, I never said they did a syncronized 1-for-1 swap...it doesn&apos;t work that way.

But let&apos;s do some simple math shall we?

According to your numbers, in 2002 the fleet size was 1468, and in 2005, it was 1491, for a net increase of 23 vehicles.

We also know that 482 new Orion 7 Diesel Low Floors were added to the fleet from 2002-2005. The only way the fleet size could increase by only 23, is if 459 buses were retired from the fleet.

Same goes for 2006...fleet size is 1543, for a net increase of 52 buses over 2005. Yet we know that 150 Orion 7 Hybrid Low Floors and 80 Orion 7 Diesel Low Floors were added to the fleet in 2006. Again, this means that 178 were retired.

Same goes for 2007...same will go for 2008.

I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve run out of old buses to give you your 15 year average age. Even if by the end of this year there are still a few&quot;old&quot;buses (as in more than 5 years old), they will be ones that were completely rebuilt in 2002, and not quite ready for retirement.

Why don&apos;t you just stop your tap-dancing and simply back up what you were called on. If you claim the average age of a TTC bus is 15 years, then give us all the buses...when they were built, and do the simple math to arrive at your claim.




KGB Top Gear February 22nd, 2008, 01:37 AM most of the TTC&apos;s bus fleet is less than 5 years old

New Order Deliveries (TTC Annual Reports)
2003 deliveries : 100
2004 deliveries : 119 + 17 = 136
2005 deliveries : 237 + 12 = 249
2006 deliveries : 150 + 80 = 230

Fleet Changes (TTC Annual Report)
2003 - 2004 net change : +13 buses
2004 - 2005 net change : -11 buses
2005 - 2006 net change : +52 buses

Notice for every year since 2003, when the large orders were starting to be filled, more buses came online than the net change, which means that there are some new buses that have not yet replaced an old bus, meaning some old buses remained on the fleet despite the new buses coming in. Exception is from 2004-2005, whereby there were 136 deliveries yet the fleet went down, meaning it was likely a 1:1 swap plus some more buses were retired without replacement.

However, looking at the 2005 and 2006 stats as well, it&apos;s very clear that when 249 new buses were delivered in 2005 yet the fleet went up by 52 buses only, that some of the old stuff remained.

Thus, your belief that it was a 1:1 swap and hence a 1:1 subtraction of the old buses&apos; age totals from the average calculation is not only incompetent, it&apos;s reckless and wrong.

Here is a simple reconciliation to make the point come home even further, and how obvious a 1:1 swap is a logical error. Yet only a simple addition and subtraction can reveal it.

2005 year-end fleet size : 1491
2006 deliveries : 230
2006 removals : 178
2006 year-end fleet size : 1543

Simple subtraction. Don&apos;t understand how that is so difficult to comprehend. It&apos;s quite logical that a 1:1 swap is not even feasible or logical to begin with considering there was service expansion. Perhaps fantasy land has set in.

In fact, how would you subtract the retired buses&apos; total age from the average computation when we don&apos;t know which buses were retired and how old they were? That has always been the caveat to my calculations and I made that very clear in an earlier post already in #455. Since you have forgotten already here it is again :

In fact, my 15 includes keeping the old buses, as there is no evidence so far to suggest how much bus scrapping is taking place, hence it is logically flawed to assume the best case scenario without appropriate evidence. That mathematical computation is still correct.

So if you want to interpret my numbers again, then it would be a conservative figure assuming all the old buses were kept. Removing all the old buses is definitely out of the question. That&apos;s not a valid assumption to begin with. Unless we get fleet information, we cannot make that calculation. However, what is very clear is that the actual true number is not likely to be near 5 at all as first claimed by KGB. That was what my calculation referred to - to make it very clear how illogical that estimate is.

And I doubt you can come up with a better estimate given the data available either. I think this part we both agree.

I suggest you look into the context of my calculations and see what they&apos;re trying to achieve. This isn&apos;t an exercise of oh my number is the one true number in the universe, but rather a response to a very crude estimate from KGB that doesn&apos;t make much sense and cannot be backed up by a reasonable calculation. It doesn&apos;t take rocket science math to detect these major errors.

In fact, I&apos;ll bring a more hypothetical example to show how wrong that 5-year figure is.

From the year-end number and delivery reconciliation like I did for 2005-2006 above, I come up with the following fleet removals :
2005 : -260
2006 : -178

We know at the end of 2004 the average age is 14 years from the article. At the time the fleet size was 1502, so the total number of vehicle years = 21,028.
Assuming the very old buses were taken out of the system, like the 30 year-old ones you alluded to before, you will subtract 30 * (260+178) = 13,140 vehicle years (assuming that in 2005 all the buses taken out were 30 years old and the same in 2006 - big assumption, but it will be a conservative estimate).

End of 2004 : 21,028 - 13,140 = 7888 vehicle years
2005 vehicle years = 1491
2006 vehicle years = 1543
Total @ 06 year-end = 10,922
2006 # Fleet = 1543
Average = 7 years (this is likely the best case scenario)

Let&apos;s do a sensitivity analysis as I doubt there are 438 30-year old buses in the fleet even at the end of 2004.

If the average age of the bus taken out of the system is 20 years old :
Calculation becomes :
Total Vehicle Years : 21,028 - 438*20 + 1491 + 1543 = 15,302
2006 # Fleet = 1543
Average = 9.9 years

Even in the likely best case scenario, the estimate is 7, and I think the likely actual figure is around 10 as in the 2nd calculation.

I&apos;ll keep scanning the media and the TTC website for more recent fleet figures when they&apos;re available.

The point of all this is, you need to know exactly what you should take out (yes, you know this), but also how you should take that out (no, you don&apos;t know this, not after you claim it&apos;s a 1:1 swap). city_thing February 22nd, 2008, 08:54 AM ohhhhhhhhhhhhh my gaaaawd will you two quit yo bitchin&apos;!

The point is that in 2002 and 2005, the swap was virtually 1:1, just like we told you but you are refusing to accept this clear and obvious fact.


However, looking at the 2005 and 2006 stats as well, it&apos;s very clear that when 249 new buses were delivered in 2005 yet the fleet went up by 52 buses only, that some of the old stuff remained
Thus, your belief that it was a 1:1 swap and hence a 1:1 subtraction of the old buses&apos; age totals from the average calculation is not only incompetent, it&apos;s reckless and wrong.

Here is a simple reconciliation to make the point come home even further, and how obvious a 1:1 swap is a logical error. Yet only a simple addition and subtraction can reveal it..Sure, by 2006 over 1000 of the buses in the fleet are relatively new, so the oldest clonkers have already been disposed of, that&apos;s why they could afford to keep some of the buses and actually increase the fleet size and service levels, since those buses are not on their dying breath. However, 197 buses were still used for a 1:1 swap, and that is about 4:5s of the order used for 1:1. Thus, for an average, there is nothing incompetenet, reckless, or wrong in the average calculation through doing a 1:1, because the overwhelming majority does indeed have that happening, meaning the numbers would be within an acceptable margin of error if one does it that way. Your adding the vehicle years consequetively in the previous post is what is reckless and wrong and incompetent because that takes the existing old clonkers that have in fact been retired and keeps them in the average, giving you a figure that is way outside any acceptable margin of error, but you fail to recognize this obvious flaw in your calculations and logic, but that&apos;s because you know nothing about this subject.


Simple subtraction. Don&apos;t understand how that is so difficult to comprehend. It&apos;s quite logical that a 1:1 swap is not even feasible or logical to begin with considering there was service expansion. Perhaps fantasy land has set in.Over 1000 of the buses have already been replaced by this point, this means that the old buses, actually are not that old, and may also be rebuilds. The overwhelming majority of the 1000 new arrivals over the last few years have gone towards a 1:1 swap, this is very obvious from the math and in all practical contexts/perspectives and applications, that is exactly what is happening, the order coming in 2008 is further proof.

In fact, how would you subtract the retired buses&apos; total age from the average computation when we don&apos;t know which buses were retired and how old they were? OK, you&apos;re so smart, why would the TTC retire anything other than the oldest in the fleet, as you are clearly implying that the TTC is retiring newer buses instead of old ones?
:ohno: You are hopeless.


So if you want to interpret my numbers again, then it would be a conservative figure assuming all the old buses were kept. Removing all the old buses is definitely out of the question. That&apos;s not a valid assumption to begin with. Unless we get fleet information, we cannot make that calculation. However, what is very clear is that the actual true number is not likely to be near 5 at all as first claimed by KGB. That was what my calculation referred to - to make it very clear how illogical that estimate is.Again, why would anything but the oldest buses be retired? You are clearly insane to be posing this question. We know which buses were retired, the oldest ones were retired because some at the time were past their lifespan! The point is that you keeping the old buses in your calculation is a blatantly flawed process and completely inaccurate. It is not only valid, it is OBVIOUS that the oldest buses get retired as the new ones arrive to replace them, that&apos;s just simple common sense and not an assumption. I agree that the number isn&apos;t necessarily 5, my number posted has consistently been 13 worst case, likely less, depends how old the remaining 500 are (13 years assumed 25-30 years old, those have likely been long since retired), something closer to 10 is more realistic, your figure of over 15 is absurd in the reality of the new deliveries in recent years.

And I doubt you can come up with a better estimate given the data available either. I think this part we both agree.
No, we don&apos;t, you&apos;re assuming incorrectly that the TTC for some inexplicable reason would defy all logic and keep the oldest buses instead of not-so-old ones when doing replacements. That&apos;s fantasy land there, you must be high or something to have ideas that far out there and non-sensical. Get mental help.
I suggest you look into the context of my calculations and see what they&apos;re trying to achieve.

It doesn&apos;t take rocket science math to detect these major errors.The major error is your statement of over 15 years old. That isn&apos;t rocket science either when 2/3rds of the fleet is about 5 years old or less. You are out to lunch, your calculations don&apos;t have any realistic context, you&apos;re trying to achieve bullshit, and waste everyone&apos;s time with your overblown ego.

We know at the end of 2004 the average age is 14 years from the article.So how come you said the average was over 15 years as new arrivals come in?

End of 2004 : 21,028 - 13,140 = 7888 vehicle years
2005 vehicle years = 1491
2006 vehicle years = 1543
Total @ 06 year-end = 10,922
2006 # Fleet = 1543
Average = 7 years (this is likely the best case scenario)This also the most realistic since the oldest are the ones that get replaced. This is also close enough to 5 years just like KGB said... DUH! Go away now, you&apos;re done.

Let&apos;s do a sensitivity analysis as I doubt there are 438 30-year old buses in the fleet even at the end of 2004.The TTC had some REALLY old buses throughout their fleet before the vehicle replacement program kicked in. The TTC has been putting this off for 10-15 years or so, at which point many buses were already well over 10 years old, but being screwed by the conservatives and the recession before then, they had to stretch the life of the fleet, meaning many MANY 25-30 year old buses in the fleet at the end of the 90s.

Even in the likely best case scenario, the estimate is 7, and I think the likely actual figure is around 10 as in the 2nd calculation.Like I kept saying the whole time, 13 is the worst case possible - that assumes all 500 or so old ones are 30 years old. That is unlikely. 10, sure, I&apos;ll believe that, my bone has been with the over 15 years average age uninformed comment you made.

The point of all this is, you need to know exactly what you should take out (yes, you know this), but also how you should take that out (no, you don&apos;t know this, not after you claim it&apos;s a 1:1 swap).You don&apos;t know how to trace the differences, that much is obvious. You don&apos;t understand cause and effect either, because if you take that into consideration, you really become the laughing stock. The purpose of the program is a 1:1 swap, service expansion if possible, but primarily a 1:1 swap first and foremost, and the overwhelming majority prior to 2006, during which service expansion actually started to kick in, the replacments were indeed going 1:1, only 23 out of several hundred were not in a 1:1 swap between 2001 and 2005, which means to argue otherwise is pointless and absurd. 23 is a negligible remainder given the volume, it&apos;s like not even 5% of the orders that came in over the 5-year time period in question. Give up, you&apos;re toast. What a crock. Skybean February 23rd, 2008, 12:25 AM Can&apos;t you show us the cool things about the Subway, not just the depressing articles?

Honestly, there is nothing exciting about Toronto subways. KGB February 23rd, 2008, 03:45 AM However, looking at the 2005 and 2006 stats as well, it&apos;s very clear that when 249 new buses were delivered in 2005 yet the fleet went up by 52 buses only, that some of the old stuff remained.

Thus, your belief that it was a 1:1 swap and hence a 1:1 subtraction of the old buses&apos; age totals from the average calculation is not only incompetent, it&apos;s reckless and wrong.


Holy shit...what part of plain english do you not understand?

Every new bus ordered is to replace a bus that is scheduled to be retired...it&apos;s that simple.

Once all replacements have been made for every bus that is scheduled to be retired, they will have an extra 100 new buses on top of that.

This does not mean that scheduled retirement of every bus coincides with the excact moment a new one arrives. TRZ&apos;s 1:1 ratio is absolutely correct...it just doesn&apos;t mean it happens simultaineously in real time.

Need to hear it from the horses mouth? Here&apos;s a couple of paragraphs from The Coupler (TTC newsletter)

262 new buses arriving
in 2005

The TTC has started accepting 262 new buses this year. The new, low-floor, 40-footers are arriving from Orion Bus Industries at a rate of six to eight per week. A total of 37 new vehicles were already operating out of Arrow Road Division at the beginning of February.

Although the TTC is receiving more than 260 new buses, the Orion VIIs do not represent additional buses. They are replacement buses to take over from the nearly identical allotment of older models that are due–or overdue–for retirement.

This thread is so dull as well! There&apos;s never any pictures or anything, only articles about how the system&apos;s underfunded. Can&apos;t you show us the cool things about the Subway, not just the depressing articles? You don&apos;t make this thread very exciting for outsiders, this thread might as well be in the Toronto section. Spice it up!

&apos;War zone&apos; stations appall subway users

Jack Lakey
Staff Reporter

Dingy, decaying, depressing, and definitely not The Better Way.

That&apos;s the verdict of readers about the condition of TTC stations, and the reason we&apos;re launching a full week of stories about it.

We recently asked for comments and examples of problems to do with cleanliness, maintenance and overall appearance of TTC stations, which touched a painful nerve with its customers.

About 200 calls and emails–the largest response we&apos;ve ever had–poured in from riders appalled by grimy, litter-strewn floors, leaky roofs, stalled escalators, abominable washrooms, abandoned repairs and a dispiriting deterioration in the appearance of stations that conveys indifference and neglect.

Of the hundreds of thousands of people who use the system daily, most will end up in one of the 69 stations, often as their point of entry. The importance of a good first impression seems lost on the TTC, based on readers&apos; responses.

Many recall when the stations were spotless and set the standard for North American public transit. People took pride in that reputation. Their memories may have grown rosier over time, but it makes the current state of affairs even harder for them to fathom.

&quot;Go to any station and you will see a thick black coating of grime on the platforms,&quot;emailed Leo Gonzalez.&quot;I still remember when those terrazzo floors used to shine, and I&apos;m only in my 30s.&quot;

&quot;Shabby is an understatement,&quot;wrote Jeff Harvey.&quot;The bus depot (at Eglinton station) is dark, dingy and dirty–a dungeon. Donlands station appears out of a war zone, with a leaky roof and ripped-open ceiling that&apos;s been like this for years. It is usually carpeted with litter.&quot;

&quot;The roof has leaked for a long time, but (lately) it has been an indoor rainstorm,&quot;wrote Sara Lipson of Kipling station.&quot;The problem is so widespread that the temporary fixes do little to stop raindrops from falling on our heads.&quot;

&quot;If I was a city health inspector, I would close down the washrooms,&quot;wrote Andrew Murphy.&quot;They are absolutely disgusting. At least I can stand up. I wouldn&apos;t want to sit on any toilet seat.&quot;

One reader complained the inside bus platforms at Kipling are cleaned,&quot;but not the outside ones. Vomit from the weekend is still there Tuesday or Wednesday.&quot;

Shawn McCabe, a TTC janitor, called to say&quot;you&apos;re taking a shot at us, as usual, and it&apos;s a one-sided affair. But the public has to take some responsibility. Sometimes they sit on a bench next to a garbage can and just dump garbage on the floor. The public has to take pride in the stations.&quot;

A reader who asked not to be named said he worked as a TTC janitor for two summers, and&quot;there is a culture of apathy and laziness,&quot;among cleaning staff.

&quot;Sleeping, playing Frisbee across the tracks, two-hour-long smoke breaks, all of these are not uncommon. Heck, I&apos;ve seen afternoon shift employees go watch movies at Cineplex in the middle of their shifts.&quot;:bash:

Comments from readers were so vivid we totalled up some of the descriptions.&quot;Filthy&quot;came up 23 times and&quot;disgusting&quot;15 times.

Dirt was the most frequently raised problem at 76 times, followed by 47 garbage complaints, 15 of which mentioned the need for more litter receptacles. There were 28 complaints about escalators, elevators and doors, 24 about station repairs, 25 about service and staff, 18 about leaky roofs and water, 14 about snow, 11 about free newspapers, eight about unfinished construction, eight about washrooms and seven about signage.

Councillor Adam Giambrone, who chairs the TTC, says the people who&apos;ve complained about deteriorating conditions are wrong, and that the stations are cleaner than they were a couple of years ago, according to system audits.

&quot;It takes a while to move people&apos;s perceptions,&quot;said Giambrone.&quot;You can&apos;t reverse the trend overnight. People do see cleaner stations (but) they don&apos;t register it.

&quot;People are coming in and saying they do see a difference because there used to be more paper on the tracks. Is it as clean as they&apos;d like? No. But the fact is, things are getting better. It&apos;s measurable.&quot;

TTC managers are understandably touchy about the criticism.

&quot;Sure, we know the washrooms are bad,&quot;says Gary Shortt, the TTC&apos;s superintendent of plant maintenance, stressing that a program to replace old plumbing fixtures with automated ones in the system&apos;s 10 washrooms is nearing completion. Customer complaints about washrooms have since dropped by 36 per cent, he said.

Janitorial staff is stretched thin, with a total of 248 cleaners to cover the entire system. The total number of dayshift cleaners during the week is just 38. To make matters worse, 2008 TTC budget documents show a daily absentee rate of 12 per cent among cleaners.

There&apos;s a lot more to cleaning a subway station than it might seem, said Shortt. For example, the black grime coating so many surfaces is a fine dust created when the brakes on trains are applied as they slow while pulling into stations.

Over time, brake dust builds up on everything and special equipment is needed to remove it in some areas, he said.

&quot;People notice that the tiles on the wall across from the platform are covered with it, but we can&apos;t just send a janitor over there,&quot;with a brush and a bucket of soapy water said Shortt.

Cleaning staff are not allowed to work at track level due to the electrified third rail in the tracks, which means a flatbed rail car is needed, which can only be used late at night, when the subway has stopped running.

When a flatbed car is available, the cleaning must be done by maintenance workers instead of janitorial staff, which further complicates the job because the first priority for maintenance staff is usually track repairs, which must also be done when the subway isn&apos;t running, he said.

Despite the cash squeeze, the TTC has substantial plans for improvements, which will be the subject of a feature article next Saturday.

We&apos;re not doing this just to dump on the TTC or proffer outrageous quotes. We&apos;re hoping it will compel the TTC and the city councillors who oversee it to take the problem more seriously and move it much higher up on the list of priorities.

And we&apos;ll be asking each commissioner what they personally intend to do to fix the problem.

&quot;I use the Finch terminus on a regular basis and it&apos;s filthy. You should take a look at the stairs leading from the main level to the bus terminal. The dust and dirt on these stairs is absolutely appalling and the ceiling has been open for months. It&apos;s a disgrace!&quot; UD2 March 10th, 2008, 03:54 AM Hahaha very funny

that is actually the case. A very large portion of the TTC&apos;s fleet is less than 5 years old. The other large portion have been in service since around 1996. LordMandeep March 10th, 2008, 07:58 PM its simple privatize the cleaning staff.

They are over paid and clearly not doing their job. Electrify March 10th, 2008, 09:24 PM ^^ Especially if this part is true...

If this is the case, then no words can express how stupid the TTC and city management is. I&apos;m all for unions, but if they don&apos;t do their jobs and shut down the system with an illegal strike, then the TTC should have gone all Reagan on their asses and fired the entire lot! UD2 March 10th, 2008, 09:36 PM its simple privatize the cleaning staff.

They are over paid and clearly not doing their job.

privatization doesn&apos;t work. Take OPG as a grand example, the province is paying more now for the privatized sector of OPG than when it was still public.

You add in the profit factor that a private company needs to make, the ineffeciency of a public institution will seem cheap.

There is a reason why no large institutions privatize or contract out their cleaning staff.

TTC hires students during he summer as cleaning crews, which explains the lack of work dedication. It&apos;s understandable because nobody really gives a damn about their summer job anyways. These guys are probably also underpaid for the job that they are asked to do, so simply economics will consititute poor porformance. LordMandeep March 11th, 2008, 01:32 AM However there is a problem of laziness.

I was waiting for a bus at a a subway stop and a full grown man,took 15 mins (taking breaks and such) to pick up 3 garbage bags and to put new ones...

Clearly the problem is that they are not doing the work and prehaps scarring some of them with outsourcing could work. Electrify March 11th, 2008, 06:32 AM However there is a problem of laziness.

Nah, they&apos;ll just pull another illegal strike and shut down the system for a day again. Until the TTC decides to stand up to this kind of incompetence and sends these people their walking papers, little is going to change. hkskyline March 11th, 2008, 09:21 AM Reposting the numbers is useless since I posted those very recently, but still proves my point, but you are oh-so-conveniently leaving out 2002 when the was a net change of -12, this is done on purpose to try to prop your argument up. The point is that in 2002 and 2005, the swap was virtually 1:1, just like we told you but you are refusing to accept this clear and obvious fact.

In 2001, the Commission entered into an agreement to purchase 220 low-floor Orion diesel buses ... at December 31, 2002, 1 vehicle has been received.

2002 saw very negligible deliveries. Factoring the 2002 deliveries will not change the fact that the bulk of the deliveries from 2003-6 was not 1:1, unless you tell me 1 delivery does make a difference. In fact, every year we see significant difference from deliveries to fleet growth. Looking at the fleet growth figures, to make your argument the swap was virtually 1:1 would mean the growth would be close to 0 every year. That is clearly not the case.

In fact, the fleet decreased from 2001 to 2002 (1480 to 1468), meaning the new deliveries were outpaced by replacements, further supporting my argument that it is not 1:1.

Looking at the 2005-2006 net change, the most recent statistics available, I find it hard to believe anyone is trying to argue that 230 buses were delivered means we replaced 230 old buses even though the fleet grew by 52. The math doesn&apos;t add up.

Sure, by 2006 over 1000 of the buses in the fleet are relatively new, so the oldest clonkers have already been disposed of, that&apos;s why they could afford to keep some of the buses and actually increase the fleet size and service levels, since those buses are not on their dying breath. However, 197 buses were still used for a 1:1 swap, and that is about 4:5s of the order used for 1:1. Thus, for an average, there is nothing incompetenet, reckless, or wrong in the average calculation through doing a 1:1, because the overwhelming majority does indeed have that happening, meaning the numbers would be within an acceptable margin of error if one does it that way. Your adding the vehicle years consequetively in the previous post is what is reckless and wrong and incompetent because that takes the existing old clonkers that have in fact been retired and keeps them in the average, giving you a figure that is way outside any acceptable margin of error, but you fail to recognize this obvious flaw in your calculations and logic, but that&apos;s because you know nothing about this subject.

Without knowing what is the average of the buses being taken out of service, it is impossible to calculate an accurate new average age. Simple mathematics can determine how many buses were removed from service, but the question is how many vehicle years do you remove from the total for the retired buses? As that question cannot be answered, the prudent thing is to be conservative, as we know not all deliveries were matched with removals. Unless you have a reasonable estimate of the average age of the vehicles removed, there is nothing wrong with calculating an upper bound.

Without any reliable statistics on what was taken out, I find it wreckless to just randomly remove them. Now that makes the new average outside any acceptable margin of error. That is clearly a major logical error.

Over 1000 of the buses have already been replaced by this point, this means that the old buses, actually are not that old, and may also be rebuilds. The overwhelming majority of the 1000 new arrivals over the last few years have gone towards a 1:1 swap, this is very obvious from the math and in all practical contexts/perspectives and applications, that is exactly what is happening, the order coming in 2008 is further proof.
A rebuild does not reset the age. A 20-year-old bus that has been overhauled is still 20 years old. Would a 60-year-old who had a few organ transplants and a new hip all of a sudden be reset to 35 years old?

I don&apos;t understand why you&apos;re trying to disprove my 2006-end figure with 2007 and 2008 deliveries. Obviously the 2006-end figure does not include 2007 and 2008. You&apos;ll have to wait and see what the actual results for 2007 and 2008 are like when they get published to see what the 2007 and 2008 year-end figures should be.

OK, you&apos;re so smart, why would the TTC retire anything other than the oldest in the fleet, as you are clearly implying that the TTC is retiring newer buses instead of old ones?
You are hopeless.

Again, why would anything but the oldest buses be retired? You are clearly insane to be posing this question. We know which buses were retired, the oldest ones were retired because some at the time were past their lifespan! The point is that you keeping the old buses in your calculation is a blatantly flawed process and completely inaccurate. It is not only valid, it is OBVIOUS that the oldest buses get retired as the new ones arrive to replace them, that&apos;s just simple common sense and not an assumption. I agree that the number isn&apos;t necessarily 5, my number posted has consistently been 13 worst case, likely less, depends how old the remaining 500 are (13 years assumed 25-30 years old, those have likely been long since retired), something closer to 10 is more realistic, your figure of over 15 is absurd in the reality of the new deliveries in recent years.


If you took a look at my sensitivity analysis, you will see that the average age of the remaining fleet moves significantly even if a moderate change in assumptions of the average age of what is taken out.

In fact, there have been incidents where new buses came up short of expectations. In 1995, David Gunn reported that the bendable buses, 7 years old then, were so poorly made they would be sent to the junkyard 11 years ahead of schedule. In 1997, the Orion V compressed natural gas bus fleet, 6 years old at the time, were grounded due to major structural failures resulting in a complete rebuild.

Hence, it is not at all surprising given the TTC&apos;s past misfortunes that there is chance that relatively new buses are being taken out because of defects. Thus, applying a blanket old average age across the board may not be such a sound approach. But then, the question, again, is what is an appropriate old average age?


The major error is your statement of over 15 years old. That isn&apos;t rocket science either when 2/3rds of the fleet is about 5 years old or less. You are out to lunch, your calculations don&apos;t have any realistic context, you&apos;re trying to achieve bullshit, and waste everyone&apos;s time with your overblown ego.
Not at the end of 2006 when I ran the numbers. As at end of 2006, only roughly half the fleet has been replaced. I can&apos;t forsee how the average age can drop so drastically to 5 as KGB first noted. But then, the deliveries from past years age as well so I don&apos;t forsee the actual number to be anywhere near 5 any time soon.

By the way, 7 is 40% bigger than 5. Not exactly very close at all when it&apos;s 40% off. That&apos;s my best case scenario.

The TTC had some REALLY old buses throughout their fleet before the vehicle replacement program kicked in. The TTC has been putting this off for 10-15 years or so, at which point many buses were already well over 10 years old, but being screwed by the conservatives and the recession before then, they had to stretch the life of the fleet, meaning many MANY 25-30 year old buses in the fleet at the end of the 90s.


This I buy since not so many years ago they were publishing average bus age as being 18 years. The fishbowls were still around well past Y2K and those vehicles must&apos;ve been rebuilt many times over to still run on the streets. However, to apply an average age of 30 across all the hundreds of fleet removals seems a bit far-stretched. We know the TTC did have a lot of very old buses, but that many?

Again, this goes back to the question of what is the average age of the removals we should be subtracting from the total. It&apos;s clear to both you and I that a subtraction has to be made, but how much is the big question mark.

You don&apos;t know how to trace the differences, that much is obvious. You don&apos;t understand cause and effect either, because if you take that into consideration, you really become the laughing stock. The purpose of the program is a 1:1 swap, service expansion if possible, but primarily a 1:1 swap first and foremost, and the overwhelming majority prior to 2006, during which service expansion actually started to kick in, the replacments were indeed going 1:1, only 23 out of several hundred were not in a 1:1 swap between 2001 and 2005, which means to argue otherwise is pointless and absurd. 23 is a negligible remainder given the volume, it&apos;s like not even 5% of the orders that came in over the 5-year time period in question. Give up, you&apos;re toast. What a crock.


Although the intention of the program is fleet renewal, the reality is a 1:1 swap is highly unlikely for practical reasons. Fleet renewal isn&apos;t the same as 1 bus in, 1 bus out. Given all the political bickering the TTC had to go through over the years and even today, getting a few orders in and having the cash to pay for it is enough of a challenge, and I doubt the funding is enough for them to sustain and grow service to demand. Hence, I doubt their planners are stupid enough to budget so tightly since the next order might disappear with a change in government or a change in government policy. Under these uncertain circumstances, I find it hard to believe they&apos;ll stick religiously to a 1:1 swap, and from the fleet movements year-over-year, it&apos;s quite evident the practical reality has overruled idealism.

By the way, you also need to consider that while a new bus is out on the street, the old bus may be sitting in the garage for back-up purposes rather than sold off / scrapped. After all, Toronto is growing, yet the bus fleet only had a net change of +75 buses from 97-06. So that makes a 1:1 swap even less feasible.

You have some new buses running. But I doubt they&apos;re that much roomier to fit today&apos;s crowds in. hkskyline March 11th, 2008, 09:34 AM Slow federal funding stalls York subway plan
Spadina project won&apos;t be ready till 2015, TTC says
1 March 2008
The Toronto Star

A lack of federal funding has already delayed completion of the Spadina subway extension to York University by a year, says TTC chair Adam Giambrone.

The joint federal-provincial-municipal project, announced amid much fanfare one year ago by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Dalton McGuinty, was supposed to be finished by 2014.

&quot;It is now in the 2015 window,&quot;Giambrone said yesterday.

Some sewer relocation and design work has been done but, under the joint trust agreement, he said, no shovels can go in the ground until the federal funds begin to flow.

&quot;You can&apos;t build a subway on announcements,&quot;said Giambrone.

&quot;I&apos;m sure (the money) will arrive at some point,&quot;he said, but typically,&quot;it takes an unacceptably long time.&quot;

But Maryse Durette, a spokesperson for Transport Canada, said Ottawa&apos;s share of the Spadina subway funding, about $697 million,&quot;is reimbursement based.&quot;She said&quot;federal funding will flow once the project is underway, construction begins and costs incurred.&quot;

Queen&apos;s Park, Toronto and York Region are expected to pick up the rest of the $2 billion price tag.

The province says it has already put up its share of the money.

&quot;We put our funds in up front. There&apos;s no reason the federal government couldn&apos;t have done the same,&quot;said Amy Tang, spokesperson for Ontario Minister of Public Infrastructure Renewal David Caplan.

The delay makes the Spadina project one of two subway extensions slated for completion in 2015. The Yonge line is expected to be built into York Region by 2015 or 2016, said John Howe, an executive with Metrolinx, the provincial agency that is allocating the $11.5 billion in provincial funding pledged for Toronto-area transit by 2020. It has asked Ottawa to chip in $6 billion for the 52 projects in the plan, the federal government has yet to make a commitment, said Howe.

Part of that money would help build the TTC&apos;s $6 billion Transit City plan to expand streetcar service. But two-thirds of the Transit City funding has already been pledged by the province, so presumably it could continue to steam ahead next year, said Giambrone.

All that&apos;s needed is Metrolinx&apos;s approval, which must come by year&apos;s end.&quot;We will not be able to issue contracts without it,&quot;he said. Skybean March 13th, 2008, 01:29 AM THE FIXER: THE BROKEN WAY

A pigeon&apos;s paradise at subway station
JACK LAKEY/TORONTO STAR


A lot of subway stations could stand a good scrubbing, but at least the scavenger birds are doing their part to keep Islington clean.

Two-thirds of the emails and calls we got for our week of stories about TTC stations were about dirt and garbage. The cleanliness of stations is obviously a top priority for riders.

Yesterday, we visited Islington and Kipling, two stations on the far west of the Bloor line that were readers rated among the grubbiest of the 69 subway stops. They did not overstate the case.

Kipling was described in one email as a&quot;war zone&quot;and it lived up to that billing. The washrooms could be smelled 20 metres away. A half-dozen buckets were scattered at the concourse level to catch water leaking from the roof, with at least as many puddles forming in other places. To deal with the water leaking above a staircase, a large sign was placed in a janitor&apos;s garbage cart and ingeniously angled to funnel the water into the cart. :ohno:

Dozens of starlings have infested Kipling, roosting in an area above the door to the women&apos;s washroom where they dump on people passing below. When hungry, they swoop down on bins at the concourse level and forage for food.

To be fair to the cleaning staff, the platforms at both stations were mostly free of litter, which can pile up rapidly due to the absence of receptacles there. They were removed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks lest they get used to conceal bombs, but the litter problem on platforms and the subway tracks has the TTC rethinking that policy.

A transit employee told us several small fires are ignited each week when trash comes into contact with the electrified third rail. More on that this Saturday.

The TTC&apos;s janitorial staff is stretched thin, according to several emails we received from cleaning staff. Two of them mentioned a culture of apathy and indifference in their ranks, and another thought this column picks on them.

On average, 38 janitors work the day shift on a weekday, cleaning the 69 stations, and 22 on weekends–picking up after 1.5 million riders. When it comes to the morsels of food hitting the floor at Islington station, the cleaning corps is outhustled and outnumbered by pigeons out for a free meal. :ohno:

A server in the bakery said the pigeons are a permanent presence there because people feed them.

EDITORIAL
Not the better way


Mar 11, 2008 04:30 AM

They should re-name it: The Shabbier Way.

Readers are inundating the Star with calls and emails highlighting the sorry state of facilities run by the once-vaunted Toronto Transit Commission. Complaints include grime-covered walls, foul washrooms, station ceilings dripping water, widespread litter, broken escalators, and vomit left uncleaned for days.

It adds up to a pervasive sense of decline in Canada&apos;s largest commuter system. But the response from TTC chair Adam Giambrone has been oddly upbeat :puke:. The station deterioration described by riders–many of whom use the system every working day–is actually a misconception (WTF?), he told the Star&apos;s Jack Lakey. Citing system audits, Giambrone insisted that facilities are now cleaner than in the past, but people are somehow failing to&quot;register&quot;the improvement. :nuts:

Really? It is hard to mistake clean for filthy, a moving escalator for one that&apos;s stalled, or a broken toilet for one that flushes.

If TTC riders have failed to&quot;register&quot;improvements, it is likely these upgrades were too minor to notice or were simply lost in a welter of other things gone wrong.

One obvious step to make things better would be to hire more janitors. With fewer than 250 cleaners, covering almost 70 TTC stations, the system&apos;s janitorial crews are stretched thin, a problem compounded by a reported absentee rate of 12 per cent.

We acknowledge that the TTC is trying to do better. Old plumbing fixtures are being replaced in the system&apos;s public washrooms and other enhancements are in the works. But these improvements may need speeding up so that they reach a critical mass that actually gets noticed by the TTC&apos;s much-put-upon riders.

In related news, these same TTC employees are demanding further pay raises and benefits:

TTC workers begin voting on offer

Mar 12, 2008 11:38 AM

Staff Reporter

Toronto Transit Commission workers began voting this morning on whether to accept or reject a contract offer.

The union would be in a strike position April 1, with negotiations expected to continue at least until then, both sides have said.

Voting began at 4 a.m. and finishes at 7 p.m. at 20 TTC shops and depots around the city, a union spokesperson said today. Results are not expected before 10 p.m.

“We don’t want a strike,”Bob Kinnear, president of the 8,000-member Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 said this week.

But the union leadership is recommending that workers reject the company offer. It proposes a 2 per cent pay increase in each year of a four-year agreement and demands concessions on benefits.

Such concessions have become a sticking point, Kinnear said, especially with the union pushing to secure better protection and compensation for drivers vulnerable to assault by passengers.

The last Toronto transit shutdown came on May 29, 2006. Workers walked off the job abruptly and illegally for the day in a disagreement with management on issues including health premiums and driver security. :puke:

AARON HARRIS/TORONTO STAR
Subway driver Shahnawaz Rasul casts his vote at the Wilson TTC complex in Toronto on March 12, 2008. The TTC&apos;s offer was overwhelmingly rejected.



Toronto Transit Commission workers voted overwhelmingly yesterday to reject a contract offer, less than three weeks before reaching a legal strike position.

Votes cast were 99.2 per cent against the offer with just over 6,000 of its 8,000 members voting, union officials said.

Bob Kinnear, president of the TTC workers&apos; union, and other union leaders had recommended that workers reject the offer due to concessions on benefits.

&quot;It was a deliberately inferior offer and deserved to be rejected,&quot;Kinnear said yesterday after the votes had been tallied.

Drivers, maintenance workers and ticket collectors voted between 4a.m. and 7p.m. at 20 TTC shops and depots around the city, said a spokesperson for Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113.

The current contract expires at the end of the month.

&quot;It&apos;s still really early,&quot;TTC chair Adam Giambrone said yesterday afternoon as workers were casting their strike votes.

&quot;We&apos;re working well to resolve the issues. But there are a lot of different things to be discussed,&quot;he said.

Giambrone anticipated union members would vote to strike, but would not comment on whether the offer made deserved to be rejected.

&quot;We bargain at the table,&quot;he said upon hearing the results.&quot;We don&apos;t bargain through the media.

&quot;There&apos;s no need for riders to take any action or to be concerned. To be quite frank this has no indication that there&apos;s going to be a strike. This is what has happened for the last 40 years. This is what collective bargaining is about,&quot;he said, adding that contract negotiations have traditionally been settled without rider disruption.

The union is trying to secure better compensation for sickness and injuries, and safety provisions.

According to Kinnear, the union was offered a two per cent pay increase in each year of a four-year agreement and significant concessions on some benefits by the TTC bargaining team last Wednesday.

Such concessions have become contentious, especially with union representatives pushing to secure better protection and compensation for drivers vulnerable to assault by passengers.

At present, TTC employees lose wages if they need to take time off after an assault or accident.

That&apos;s significant because transit workers in Toronto suffer higher rates of post-traumatic stress than police officers.

&quot;We have transit operators who are beaten, punched, spat upon–sometimes injured so they cannot continue to work and perform their duties–and they&apos;re penalized financially and that is completely unacceptable,&quot;Kinnear said.

The last Toronto transit shutdown came May 29, 2006. Workers walked off the job abruptly and illegally for the day over health premiums and driver security.

Giambrone said that while the walkout caught him off guard, he doesn&apos;t expect similar action this time around.

Negotiations have been underway for the past three weeks. Both sides have until April 1–the strike deadline–to come to an agreement.

-------------------------------------

The reason why stations are so dirty is there is a lack of cleaning staff and a 12% absentee rate. A low number of cleaning staff are hired because they have terrific salary and benefits which are paid by the TTC (and ultimately tax payers and transit users).

The TTC commits 80% of its operating budget on staff salaries and benefits -- this would never be sustainable in a private corporation.

TTC token/cash collector (with 12 months experience or more) - $26.58/hour
Source: Current collective agreement: Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113

Honestly, does anyone other than transit workers themselves think that token collectors deserve this type of pay? What makes this job more difficult than working at a fast food joint where the pay is a third of that amount?

Every couple of years the transit union rejects the city&apos;s contract, threatens to strike and ultimately the city agrees to the demands (and then some...). These costs are then transferred directly to tax payers and transit riders through increased fares and property taxes. As a result, public transit becomes more expensive, service doesn&apos;t improve and transit workers sense of entitlement and complacency increase. In any private corporation a raise is given if there is an improvement in workplace performance and service, not so with the TTC. Every time there is a contract negotiation, salary and benefits MUST go up. I think that the nearly broke city has given workers an excellent deal but of course the greedy union wants more, more, more. hkskyline March 14th, 2008, 04:41 AM Stations to receive artful make-overs
Some purists want TTC to preserve subway&apos;s heritage
8 March 2008
National Post

The TTC is introducing art into its subway stations as part of an underground make-over that has public-art advocates cheering, even as preservationists fear the system&apos;s visual identity is being lost.

&quot;I think this is the best thing, this integration of art into the subway stops,&quot;said Colette Laliberte, a professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD).&quot;Reinventing the subway line and incorporating art there, it&apos;s like walking through a gallery on your way to work, it&apos;s fantastic.&quot;

This week, the TTC held an open house on its plans for the Pape station, the first station that will be revamped under the TTC&apos;s $275-million station modernization program. It was launched last summer on the Bloor-Danforth line, and includes $25-million for&quot;aesthetic changes&quot;in the stations.

The $20.8-million Pape station revamp is anticipated to begin this fall, to be followed by the Dufferin station and then the Bloor-Yonge station, said Dave Grigg, project manager for the program.

&quot;The intent is that basically the whole appearance needs to change,&quot;Mr. Grigg said.

The program aims to improve finishings on the walls, floors and ceilings inside the subway stops, along with better lighting. On the outside, the focus will be on creating new station appearances and landscaping.

However, for Ms. Laliberte -- who teaches a course on art in the public realm -- more art on the subway line is most important.&quot;When you think of the number of people who take the subway every day, some people are in there for hours going from Kipling to the other side of the city. So seeing the variety [of art] from one station to another is a moment of enrichment in your day to day life,&quot;Ms. Laliberte said.

&quot;We don&apos;t have enough art in our life and this is bringing it to us in the subway,&quot;she said.&quot;It&apos;s refreshing.&quot;

After its renovation -- set to be completed in 2010 -- the Pape station will display approximately 80 digital photographs of the station by Kitchener artist Allan Harding MacKay.

Mr. MacKay said the $85,000 artwork will be displayed in a series of two-by four-foot photos, with the actual photo set alongside abstract versions.

&quot;The images are first literal and then get made into a series where they get transformed, abstracted, swirled or highly textured. In other words, they move from being very recognizable images to more of an abstraction,&quot;said Mr. MacKay, who also created the Veterans&apos; Memorial Wall at Queen&apos;s Park.

Mr. MacKay said the works took six months to complete, and although the TTC commissioned the project, the idea behind the art was his own.

&quot;I wanted to do something with the environment that stimulates the imagination of people, to let their own subjectivity develop meaning for them,&quot;he said, adding he wanted passengers to view the Pape station and its surroundings through their own eyes.

The modernization program has raised some controversy with purists upset the subway line&apos;s iconic visual identity -- the system even has its own typeface -- is being tampered with.

&quot;There are a few stations that are in their original form and to renovate that you obviously lose some of that. The question is, is it significant or of value? Is that loss something that&apos;s irreparable?&quot;said Andrew Pruss, an architect with ERA Architects Inc.

City councillor Adam Vaughan, who is on the Toronto Preservation Board, said the TTC should take into consideration the historical value of the subway line before it tears it apart.

&quot;The Bloor-Danforth line is a rhythm of colours that has a set pattern and it&apos;s designed as a piece and it speaks to an era gone by,&quot;Mr. Vaughan said.

&quot;Before we start tampering with this and breaking it up, there&apos;s some history there, and I think there needs to be a discussion held on how to preserve it and recognize it as heritage,&quot;Mr. Vaughan added.

Mr. Grigg said heritage considerations &apos;&apos;are being reviewed,&apos;&apos; and the TTC hopes it can renovate the stations without offending the preservationists. &apos;&apos;We plan to bring something on board,&quot;he said.

Other stops to be renovated on the Bloor-Danforth line, which opened in 1966, include the Islington station, at a cost of $19.6-million, Kipling for $35.5-million and Victoria Park for $46.4-million. Construction is set to complete by 2010 and renovations on these stations will focus on restructuring, along with having easy accessibility.

Similar reconstructions along the University line, which opened in 1963, are a joint initiative between the TTC and Toronto Community Foundation.

In that initiative, St. Patrick and Osgoode stations will be renovated, each at a cost of $5-million. A date hasn&apos;t been set as to when the construction will start.

An ongoing $5-million facelift for the Museum station will be completed on April 8. Electrify March 14th, 2008, 06:33 PM &quot;The Bloor-Danforth line is a rhythm of colours...

The only the B-D line is a&quot;rhythm of colours&quot;is if you are high on acid.

...that has a set pattern and it&apos;s designed as a piece and it speaks to an era gone by,&quot;Mr. Vaughan said.

It speaks to an era when public transit&apos;s future goal was to be a service for the very poor, and anyone slightly over the poverty line would own two cars. Skybean March 15th, 2008, 12:32 AM The only the B-D line is a&quot;rhythm of colours&quot;is if you are high on acid.

If you took the Yonge line today between Davisville and Eglinton, you would have seen a snowman beside one of the tracks... complete with TTC operator gloves on two sticks (for hands), which was obviously erected by TTC employees while on the job. :ohno:

Stalled repairs exasperate TTC riders
Mar 13, 2008 04:30 AM
Jack Lakey
Staff Reporter

There&apos;s always repair work going on at TTC stations, but many jobs seem to take forever to finish and appear abandoned.

A lot of TTC stations are upwards of 50 years old, which is among the reasons why they&apos;re fraying around the edges. To keep up, TTC workers are constantly removing wall tiles, tearing apart escalators, opening up ceilings and fiddling with wiring.

In many cases, the work comes to a halt long before it is finished. A barrier is erected or yellow caution tape is strung up around the project, then nothing happens for months or even years at a time.

About 18 months ago, we wrote about a problem at Dupont station that required scaffolding near the collector&apos;s booth. Recently, we spotted the scaffolding in the same place, which readers also reported.

We&apos;ve received many complaints about stalled repairs at TTC stations. Just yesterday, a reader emailed about exposed support beams in two spots on the platform level at King station he says have been that way&quot;for years.&quot;We found a wide area of exposed structural steel, some of which is so badly eaten by rust that it looks dangerous.

Another common complaint involves ceiling slats that are removed to get at an electrical fixture or a water leak, but are not replaced.

Worse, the TTC often fails to post a sign that explains the delay and when the job will be done. In some cases, such as an escalator that&apos;s being rebuilt at Eglinton station, a sign explains details of the work, but the completion date keeps changing, which frustrates riders.

Many are also annoyed by crude signage, noting a hand-lettered sign on a piece of cardboard telling riders to&quot;use other door&quot;is not good enough for a major transit system.

A recent email from Antoine Belaieff, complaining about the closure of the northeast entrance to College station,&quot;with no notice or explanation,&quot;aptly captures the problem.&quot;A few days ago, tiles started coming off (the stairs), causing a tripping hazard, so the entrance was closed. The tiles were fixed and the entrance reopened. Now the entrance is closed again.

&quot;Can&apos;t the TTC post notices like every other major transit system with an explanation and the name and contact information of a manager in charge of solving the problem?&quot;

It&apos;s an excellent question.

TORY ZIMMERMAN/TORONTO STAR
Downsview station.


It&apos;s been a dark and dirty ride, but the Toronto Transit Commission says there&apos;s light in the form of tidier and better-looking stations at the end of the subway tunnel.

For the past week, we&apos;ve focused exclusively on problems with cleanliness, maintenance and upkeep at the TTC&apos;s 69 stations, based on more than 200 emails and calls from readers fed up with grime, garbage, abandoned repairs and an air of indifference and decay at many stations.

Transit managers admit appearance issues were neglected from the early 1990s on, because scarce resources were directed to maintaining route service and keeping aging equipment rolling.

But with new subways, trains, buses and streetcars on the way, and service improvements such as the buses recently added to the Dufferin route, more dollars are becoming available again for upkeep of stations. A substantial plan to make things better has been mapped out over the past 18 months or so.

Some initiatives are big, like the complete rebuilds of the Victoria Park and Pape stations that will begin soon, along with major refurbishing at Kipling and Islington.

There&apos;s also money in the 2008 budget to hire an extra 13 station janitors and a second crew of painters, which means stations will be painted far more often.

Other budget outlays are small but flexible, like the $500,000 earmarked annually for cosmetic repairs such as stains on terrazzo floors, or grouting station walls with a dark material that doesn&apos;t show dirt.

And city councillors who sit on the transit commission have pledged to push for the resources needed to keep stations clean.

&quot;Fewer studies, more hands-on work,&quot;summed up Councillor Anthony Perruzza, one of the nine commissioners.

&quot;There is a plan, and exciting things are happening,&quot;said Gary Webster, the TTC&apos;s chief general manager.

One glaring problem in recent years the sight of trash piling up on subway platforms stems from a post-9/11 decision to remove garbage bins for fear they could be used to hide bombs.

The TTC had hoped riders would carry their discards up to bins at the mezzanine level, but it hasn&apos;t worked, said Webster, who added the removal of platform bins is now under review.

Councillor Adam Giambrone, who chairs the TTC, is ebullient about the coming improvements, though he insists stations are cleaner and better-kept than most riders realize.

&quot;I&apos;m concerned most about the service,&quot;said Giambrone (Ward 18, Davenport).&quot;We still set standards internationally. (Really....really... what standards? Surely no standards for cleanliness. Me thinks he is lying out of his rear. Giambrone should look at systems outside N.A.). There have been comments made in international transit circles that Toronto is back.

&quot;We have this great video of the president of the American Public Transit Association from about five years ago saying, `What happened, Toronto? You&apos;ve fallen down.&apos;&quot;

When things improve after a prolonged decline,&quot;It takes three times as much work to turn someone&apos;s opinion once they&apos;ve said, `Look, the system is dirty, I&apos;m sick and tired of this,&apos;&quot;as to shift the attitude the other way, he said.

One problem of perception is that Toronto stations were so well-kept for so long that it set an impossibly high standard when the system began to age and money for upkeep dwindled, Webster said.

&quot;If you go back to the &apos;80s, when the system was 20 years newer, we had many less appearance problems,&quot;he explained.&quot;The system was in what I would call a state of good repair ... and we were able to maintain it at a level of good appearance and cleanliness.&quot;

In the early to mid-1990s, the general economy faltered, jobs were lost and TTC ridership plummeted, which tightened the money available for station upkeep. Relatively new buses were falling apart, other equipment was wearing out and fare-box revenue was down.

&quot;We had very little capital and operating money, and the system was really in trouble in terms of basic, fundamental things so the majority of our efforts were focused on state of good (equipment) repair,&quot;said Webster.&quot;Appearance issues were starting to catch up with us.&quot;

When the Progressive Conservatives were elected to Queen&apos;s Park in 1995, they slashed TTC operating subsidies, which further squeezed its ability to maintain the appearance of stations built back in the 1950s and early 1960s, he said.

Thanks to the more recent infusion of capital to pay for new rolling stock, however, the TTC can finally start to focus on station cleanliness.

Gary Shortt, the TTC&apos;s superintendent of physical plant, says cleaning the dark soot that coats many station surfaces is harder than it would seem. It&apos;s caused by the fine dust that comes off the brakes of trains as they pull in.

When aluminum ceiling slats are removed to make repairs or renovations above them, the black soot can&apos;t be scrubbed off with water and is still there when they go back up. The soot on the top side of the slats is so thick that it oozes back down over the face of the slats for days after it becomes wet, which only makes the problem worse.

A company that uses a special wax material has been hired to clean the slats. Shortt said the wax is not only a cleaning agent, it applies a coating that inhibits buildup of brake dust.

Hiring more painters will also improve station appearances, said Shortt, noting&quot;It&apos;s amazing what a paint job will do.&quot;

Previously, a paint crew was on the job from April to June and from September through November, and needed seven years to cover all 69 stations, he said. Now, two crews will work from April through November, and each station should get a new coat every three years.

&quot;It&apos;s not capital-intensive work, it&apos;s labour. And it costs money to do it, but you get a good bang for your buck,&quot;Webster said.

Joe Mihevc (Ward 21, St. Paul&apos;s), TTC vice-chair

Wants: More cleaning staff hired, and better deployment of them; a public education campaign; trash bins back on subway platforms.

&quot;When people are farting around and wrecking things, it&apos;s just not acceptable any more. That&apos;s a big PR campaign I think we need to engage in. It&apos;s a mammoth undertaking to keep all the stations clean.

&quot;(We need to) hold management&apos;s feet to the fire through quarterly reports.&quot;

Michael Thompson (Ward 37, Scarborough Centre)

Wants: cleaning staff who are proactive and more flexible to go where they&apos;re needed; p.a. announcements to get co-operation from riders.

&quot;There&apos;s too much paper and debris on tracks. Who cares about the (management) plan? Let&apos;s just clean the bloody thing up. We have a system that&apos;s not kept up to an appropriate standard. If people see an environment that&apos;s clean, they are more apt to use the bin.&quot;

Anthony Perruzza (Ward 8, York West)

Wants: Cleaners targeted to grotty, high-traffic stations and a public education program.

&quot;I told (TTC managers) that if the stations are dirty, we need to put more resources into them, hire a few more janitors. We need to better educate our users, because it&apos;s really their system. I would prefer to put money into a public education campaign than an audit. I can read (The Fixer) and get the same thing for free.&quot;

Glenn DeBaeremaker (Ward 38, Scarborough Centre)

Wants: He&apos;s willing to fight&quot;like a Tasmanian devil&quot;for more funds to rebuild stations and hire janitors.

For 10 years&quot;the TTC was so starved of money and focused on safety that customer service and cleanliness were way down on the priority list ... we were in crisis mode for a lot of that time.&quot;

He says,&quot;People need to be more courteous, stop leaving newspapers or a half-eaten box of KFC on a bench.&quot;

Peter Milczyn (Ward 5, Etobicoke-Lakeshore)

Wants: More money spent on stations, possibly even by easing off on service improvements.

He says riders must be made more aware of their own role.&quot;Garbage doesn&apos;t fall from the sky. We could use public education and a cleanup campaign.

&quot;Maybe we should have signs with a red circle with a pig in it and a red diagonal line across it that says, `We&apos;re not Hogtown any more.&apos;&quot;

Suzan Hall (Ward 1, Etobicoke North)

Wants: More cleaners and public education. Would add to the $500,000 annual fund for small repairs.

&quot;In this snowy weather the floors are a mess and can&apos;t be mopped up as readily as you might like.

&quot;I think there&apos;s a need to spend more money on the small repairs that really affect the way things look, and I think it&apos;s important to educate people that this is their system.&quot;

Sandra Bussin (Ward 32, Beaches-East York)

Wants: She said she has an office policy to forward every suggestion received from the public for the TTC&apos;s attention.

&quot;I find the TTC to be very responsive to rider input, and response time is based on the degree of work required. Only in very recent years has the TTC received federal and/or provincial funding, which provides relief to the city.&quot;

I think it&apos;s outrageous that the union is walking away from negotiations. They are holding the city ransom. This new deal that they propose (100% pay for injuries and sickness) will INCREASE the level of complacency and laziness that already exists with many TTC workers. They are already very very handsomely paid as it is. Instead of coming to work on the odd day, they may decide to call in sick / injured everyday and enjoy FULL benefits while TTC passengers suffer even more. That 12% absentee rate for cleaners is going increase much much more. :ohno:

Their greed has no end in sight. Not even negotiating now. There will be a transit strike next week.


Toronto Transit union says safety first, or no contract

Operator safety is the issue that has driven a wedge between the Toronto Transit Commission and its union—and threatens to bring Canada&apos;s largest city to a halt next week.

&quot;We have called off negotiations until the TTC can address this fundamental issue,&quot;said union president Bob Kinnear.

Right now, drivers, operators and maintenance staff suffer a reduction in pay if they are off work because of injuries on the job. The union says that must change and has drawn a line in the sand.

&quot;It is very unlikely that there will be an offer that will be accepted by our negotiating committee that does not address this issue,&quot;said Kinnear.

Speaking at a morning news conference, the Local 113 president said the union has&quot;called off&quot;negotiations on a new contract, describing talks to date as&quot;unproductive.&quot;

Kinnear said that the union&apos;s negotiating committee is adamant that it will get an agreement on unreduced pay for injured TTC employees, or there will not be a deal.

&quot;To be quite honest, there are a number of issues on the table that [have] had very little discussion. You know our negotiating committee took the position last week, because the negotiations have been so unproductive to this point, we took a position that we needed this issue addressed and we wanted the TTC to seriously begin discussions on this issue.&quot;

Kinnear said the issue of driver safety is&quot;fundamental&quot;to the union&apos;s bottom line.
Sometimes 2 or 3 assaults a day

&quot;I can tell you that each and every day of the year we see at least one assault. Sometimes there are two or three. So there are literally hundreds of injuries through assaults, as well as a number of incidents that have been widely reported through the media of our maintenance workers working in increasingly difficult conditions and increasingly unsafe conditions.&quot;

He added:&quot;We believe that this is a moral issue.

&quot;This is a major deal breaker. If [TTC general manager] Gary Webster can make arguments as to why the front-line employees…should have their pay reduced because they&apos;re attacked, if he can give us a reasonable answer as to why they should incur that penalty and he does not, then we&apos;ll take a look at it.&quot;

Toronto&apos;s transit system could come to a halt as early as next week if the two sides in the contract negotiations fail to reach an agreement.

Local 113 of the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union represents more than 9,000 TTC workers.

The TTC carries more than 1.5 million passengers every weekday.

TTC chair Adam Giambrone said Tuesday morning he remains hopeful the two sides can work out a deal without disrupting transit service.
First offer unanimously rejected

&quot;We don&apos;t have any information as to whether or not negotiations will continue. We&apos;re still hoping for a negotiated settlement, and we&apos;re working very hard to achieve it,&quot;said Giambrone.

The workers strongly—almost unanimously—rejected the TTC&apos;s first offer two weeks ago, saying that it didn&apos;t adequately address the safety issue, as well as other monetary concerns.

Kinnear says the union doesn&apos;t want a strike, but insists the union must get back some of the concessions it has given up over the years.&quot;We continue to endure,&quot;he said, making reference to contracts from more than a decade ago.&quot;We&apos;ve done our part.&quot;

The unionized workers are in a legal strike position as of midnight next Monday. So they could walk off the job anytime after that.

The last time the TTC was affected by a work stoppage was in May 2006. The one-day illegal walkout caused chaos in the city. The commission said the shutdown cost the TTC about $3 million in lost revenue.

In a news release issued while Kinnear was speaking to reporters, the TTC said it&quot;values its employees and has made workplace safety its top priority.&quot;

That&apos;s how I describe my current feelings towards TTC staff... not 100% of them but very close.

I think there&apos;s a systemic acceptance of mediocrity due to a misconception that what they are delivering is&quot;worth a million&quot;, yea, maybe a million Lira! Vancouverite March 26th, 2008, 10:24 AM The TTC should accelerate its plans to transition to an automated train control suite. Robots don&apos;t strike. During Vancouver&apos;s summer-long transit strike in 2001 SkyTrain kept running while the buses were ground to a halt. As an aside, the 2001 nat&apos;l census occurred during the strike and this utterly skewed Vancouver&apos;s transit stats for half a decade.
