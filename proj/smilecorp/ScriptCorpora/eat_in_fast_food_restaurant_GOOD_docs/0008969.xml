Very fresh
 
I don&apos;t understand the bad reviews here. This was by far the cleanest, freshest tasting Mexican food I have had in the city. I had the shrimp tacos and fish tacos platter. The fish and shirimp were very fresh and tasty, and the tortillas were light and obviously homemade. The rice was fluffy and moist, and black beans well seasoned. The atmosphere is definitely casual but has an authentic feel.

I love this place
 
Reminds me of simple but delicious meals I enjoyed in Mexico not fancy but very good generous meals. Friendly staff and quick service. They also deliver. Highly recommend the specials.

Not recommended
 
Positive: Service was great Negative: This was the most disappointing mexican food I ever had. Had no taste and it seemed like a Fast food restaurant. Value isnt that great. I will never eat here again.

The most delectable, divine Sonoran Mexican Cuisine!
 
Everything on the menu is mouthwatering..... Just like Grandma&apos;s kitchen... You can taste the love that is put into it... The perfect amount of flavor in every dish. Mole poblano is a an aromatic dish if you are a chili and chocolate lover to the stuffed peppers... Truly like eating from the movie&quot;Like Water for Chocolate.&quot;Allow your palette to fall in love here&lt;3

Great little place for a Mexican bite
 
I came across this restaurant when the need arose to find something a carnivore (me) and a vegetarian (my lunch companion) would both like. The soups are fantastic. The service is great. The tamales and fajitas are good but the enchilladas are the thing you can keep coming back to enjoy again and again. I have been there for lunch on four occasions. It is always a great experience.

Below-mediocre
 
Very poor quality, and absolutely mediocre preparation. I ordered the chicken fajitas. They were actually terrible. I&apos;m truly surprised at the low quality given all the mexican places there are to eat these days. Their salsa was downright bad. Service nice though.
