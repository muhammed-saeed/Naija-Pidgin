Weight Loss Tips: Eat what you want
 
Pizza the health food diet?
 Even thin people love pizza. 
What you eat doesn&apos;t matter - honest!
 


Focus on How Much You Eat, Not on What You Eat



With spring on the way, you can trade in that cup of hot chocolate for some iced tea; instead of hearty hot meals, grilling out with burgers, potato salad and apple pie or peach cobbler, topped with vanilla ice cream, are on the menu. Pretty soon, it&apos;s going to be summer and with summer comes summer fare. After that, fall with its own special menu arrives, such as state fair cotton candy, funnel cakes, and corn dogs.



Unfortunately, perhaps for you, no matter what time of year it is, thin people eat just those foods as you do even though they are said to be&quot;fattening.&quot;Yet, those people don&apos;t gain weight. Why would that be?




 
Thin people drink real Coke
 


Well, it&apos;s not really what you eat, but how much you eat that matters when it comes to weight gain. Yes, thin people, too, drink Coke, eat Snickers bars, and have that cream puff. Yet, they don&apos;t gain weight. And perhaps also unfortunately, the opposite is also true. If you&apos;re a serious health food buff, maybe even vegetarian, you can be just as overweight or obese as those who eat the standard American diet. But don&apos;t listen to me if you don&apos;t want to. Do some research on your own.



Go to McDonald&apos;s or another fast food restaurant, and look at the thin and overweight people there. Then, go on over to your favorite health-food restaurant (if you have one) or one nearby you if you&apos;re not a health-food nut, and take a look at the patrons there. Do a similar count of both slim and overweight people there, too. What do you see? You&apos;re likely to see as many overweight and obese people at the health-food restaurant as you are at the fast food restaurant.



Now, why is it that a vegetarian can be overweight or obese just as one who eats the standard American diet can be? That&apos;s really quite simple. If you have three helpings of vegetarian spaghetti, some chocolate cake (even vegetarian-based) and a latte, you&apos;ll have a similar amount of calories in that meal as you will with most meat-based or similar&quot;American fare&quot;meals. Even for health-food fans, the calories themselves are what count more than anything; if you have three helpings of broccoli cheese casserole, you&apos;re still getting too many calories. Even though some of those calories are supposed&quot;healthy&quot;calories, calories are calories, and it&apos;s your caloric intake in general that makes you gain weight.




 
Chocolate IS a food group
 Not many foods are more processed than chocolate - yet thin people eat chocolate bars every day. 
It&apos;s not processed food, sugar or starches
 


Let&apos;s take a look at processed foods, too. Processed foods first came into the American diet at the end of the 18th century. Those who were richest ate the most processed foods, because they could afford to pay for the extra refinement. However, up until about 1990, the rich who ate the most processed foods still had the least amount of problems with being overweight and obese. The poor had the most obesity in their ranks, about 10%. The middle class had between 7 and 8% of its population as overweight or obese, while the richest classes had just 1 or 2% of its population overweight or obese. Today, every class boasts equal amounts of overweight and obese people.



Many experts theorize about good calories, bad calories, high or low-carb diets, and high or low nutrition content foods. In general, these people say that if you eat healthy food, you&apos;ll get thin, whereas if you eat&quot;unhealthy&quot;food, you&apos;ll be overweight or even obese.

However, if you look at everyday people eating everyday foods, most normal weight, overweight and obese people eat the same things and at about the same percentages. The only real difference between being normal weight versus overweight or obese is that those who weigh a normal amount eat the amount of calories their bodies need, while overweight and obese people eat a little bit to a lot more than their bodies need, depending on the amount of extra weight they carry with them.

What you eat is nothing compared to HOW MUCH of it you eat
 


When it comes to your weight , what you eat does not really count. However, how much you eat does.



This is where we get down to the nitty-gritty. Because it&apos;s not what you eat but how much you eat that can make you slim or overweight. Why is it that some people, no matter where they come from, eat more than they need to even though they know they shouldn&apos;t and hate being overweight?

In fact, it&apos;s something called the&quot;Food Monster.&quot;That is that constant urge, that those of us who are overweight all have, to eat or snack even when we&apos;re not hungry. And again, it&apos;s not because our food is less nutritious than 100 years ago. It&apos;s because we have something going on deep in our subconscious minds that we need to focus on. We need to focus on this, not on blaming our food suppliers for what they provide us or for what we eat, and we certainly also don&apos;t need to beat up on ourselves for our weight problems.

Good hub. Spring is in the air and it&apos;s also&quot;diet&quot;season. Hopefully spring cleaning and home improvement projects will be the positive start of physical fitness.

Focusing on how much we eat rather than tabooing foods should resolve that diet = depriving. Good positive spin.

Doing the depriving thing always leads to feeling bad and the gaining the weight back. So you bet, get in gear with spring cleaning or improving you home. Those things will make people feel better and find it easier to curb the emotional eating.

I just found this article and it basically reinforces everything I have found to be true. The only time I have ever lost weight and kept it off over months and years has been when I have reduced the amount I eat, and also when. The only time I put on weight is when I have gone through periods where my helpings have been larger and there have been more on them. I once lost 11 pounds in a month just by eating a slightly smaller evening meal and not eating anything after it. What I ate remained exactly the same.

I&apos;m sure that realistically, getting my calories from fresh, healthy foods is going to be better for me on the whole, but eating this way all the time is very difficult to maintain. It&apos;s nice to know that a doughnut isn&apos;t going to hurt, that a glass of wine isn&apos;t going to hurt, as long as it&apos;s not half a dozen of either.

Valerie,

Congratulations on your weight loss - and discovering a basic truth about what really works.

You are absolutely right, good food is best, but for most of us it is also quite stressful to have that perfect diet. The result is that we are more stressed and gain weight because of the stress.

Truly enjoy that occasional donut and it is a stress relief moment - that is good for the waist line.

The underlying issue is why do some people need to eat a box of donuts, or always clean their plate? Those are the things that cause long term and even severe weight gain.

Relax and enjoy that glass of wine along with your weight loss!

Wow! so far this is my favorite tip on losing weight..;) having to eat whatever I want but then again I still have to consider the quantity of the food I&apos;m putting on my mouth. But over all, I think this tip on losing weight will definitely work.

BS. It is what and how much you eat actually. In fact, junk foods are so non-filling that you have to eat more just to feel satisfied. More calories = more weight unless you doing some serious exercising.

I can bet you that those thin people who drink coke and so on either have an incredible metabolism or are incredibly active or both. To keep my weight off I eat well most of the time, meaning plenty of fruit, veggies, whole grains and healthy fat. And I don&apos;t drink much soda, and when I do it&apos;s diet.

I also exercise six days a week.

The reason you see so many big people drinking diet is because they&apos;re trying to lose weight, not because diet soda makes you fat. Slender people more than likely just avoid soda all together. Probably a better idea.

But I will agree that depriving yourself of fun food like pizza, etc. is fool hardy. If you want pizza or chips or whatever, just eat less.
