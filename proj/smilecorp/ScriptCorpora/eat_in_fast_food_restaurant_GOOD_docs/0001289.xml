Smoke Remedy, Lung Remedy, and DTox Remedy–Scams Luring Smokers To Quit With False Practices and False Testimonials
 By clubber3479 
 




Have you ever tried to quit smoking? Smoking is one of the hardest habits to break as soon as you start.  It seems like the only goal of the Tobacco companies ever since the early 1900’s has been greed and lots of it.  No matter how many people result with lung cancer, or how many people get mouth cancer, the large tobacco companies such as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, ITC Limited, Jerry Sparks, KT&amp;G Corporation, Philip Morris, Reynolds American, Tim Wrenn Sr.

Each and every year these companies make millions of dollars in profit and don’t care about people’s health risks because its money in their pockets.  Law suits have been an issue with being filed against these tobacco companies, but not much has prospered from these actions.  The U.S. Surgeon General issued to the public in 1964 that smoking cigarettes was a direct association to ling cancer.  Shortly after the U.S. Surgeon General announced this relationship, advertising tobacco products on T.V. and on the radio was prohibited.  This also led to the start of mandating tobacco companies to print health warnings on their product.

Ever since smoking cigarettes were found as a health hazard, there are many people trying to quit and defeat the need for nicotine. Product to help aid people quitting smoking cigarettes have seemed to increase by the day.  Products such as Quiterclock, Equate Stop Smoking Aid Gum, Commit, My Stop Smoking Coach, Nicorette Gum, and millions of others have been shoved down the throats of people trying to quit smoking.

One product that seems to be on every other infomercial on T.V. is Smoke Remedy. Every day and night that I watch T.V., I must see at least 10 of these infomercials trying to get me to buy this ridiculous product that is a 100% scam.  Obviously 1 in a 100 people, one product may work for someone and the remaining 99 people are screwed.  I had been smoking for about 25 years and decided that seeing my mother dying of lung cancer in the hospital was enough for me.  I had done some research on different methods of quitting and different products in the market.

As I was scanning the internet review after review, I landed on Smoke Remedy and remembered the info commercials I had seen on T.V.  over the year.  I decided to try Smoke Remedy because when I went to SmokeRemedy.com, they had a free 30-trial.  When I had read the testimonials and success stories, I was suckered into the fabulous world of infomercials and false testimonials.

As I had reviewed their site to find the ingredients listed as 100% natural and 100% safe!  I then had dug through the FAQ’s and had found the ingredients, but not in plain text.  They describe the ingredients as followed:

“The homeopathic medicines in Smoke Remedy™ come from several different plant and mineral sources that include:

 Avena sativa to help with the addiction to nicotine and tobacco Caladium seguinum, Daphne indica, Eugenia jambosa, Tabacum, and Plantago major, these help to stop the craving and desire to Kali phosphoricum, Nux vomica, and Staphysagria to help prevent the withdrawal symptoms you may experience when quitting The product also contains purified water, citric acid and potassium sorbate.” 

-www.SmokeRemedy.com

Well, as I was lured into this scam, I had my Smoke Remedy delivered to my doorstep in about 5 days.  When I tried the 3 sprays of the Smoke Remedy it was horrible.  On the site, it states that there is no taste once so ever.  There was a disgusting taste that is very hard to describe.  I had fought through it day by day, 3 squirts by 3 squirts.  After taking it for 20 days, I decided to get my refund back and just entered into another battlefield.  After they stated to me that they wouldn’t charge my credit card because I canceled my free 30 day risk free trial.  The next month I noticed that they were still taking money out of my account.

I had quickly got on the phone with the customer service department and told them that if I didn’t receive a refund of the money they took out of my account.  They were quick to tell me that the account was cancelled and no money was taken out of my account.  I told the woman that  I had my bank statement right in front of me and would take this to court and there scam would be shut down.  The stories suddenly turned and they woman quickly said that they were issuing the money back into my account and tried selling me there other products Lung Remedy and D-Tox Remedy.  I had upsettingly told the woman I just want my money back and made sure I had the money placed into my account.  After 3 days, the money was credited back to my checking account and I never tried another product after that.

To quit smoking it takes perseverance and strong mind power to complete it.  I knew that I could pull through the strong cravings, especially when I went to parties because I always smoked when I drank.  I actually stopped going to clubs and parties for about 6 months.  I finally quit smoking cold turkey on August 1, 2010.  Ever since I have not touched a single cigarette nor thought about the idea of needing one.

One free tool that each and every single person has is will power.  This is the only tool that you need to quit smoking cigarettes.  Don’t pay any attention to the chewing gums, sprays, nor pills that are said to make you quit smoking in days because they are just scams that are there to make money on.  Smoke Remedy and the other leading scams try desperately for you to be sucked into the world of testimonials and fake infomercials.  Smoke Remedy is 100% a scam.

The female Rep said they have a lot of numbers&amp;dont know! Funny so she gave me the sales dept#. Which was again the # to speak to their live sales agent. 800-257-4370!

Call #3 I missed placed the number above so called the sales dept again. I was interrogated by the Rep LaVern. I asked her for the customer service #. She said she can only give it out if I have purchased the product. I shared that I had just called&amp;the rep before instantly transfered me to cust. service to give me the ingredients&amp;I would like to have it on hand as well before I purchased the product. She then started reading her script of ingredients to avoid providing the CUST SERVICE#. I asked her again for the #&amp;tried to argue that she just gave me the ingredients. I said thank you but again I need to for my file if Im going to order. She put me on hold to do who knows what&amp;I hung up, googled their number&amp;found it on the cust serivce # on their site. I had also called&amp;verified myself.

 http://www.livingwellremedies.com/living_well_remedies_terms_and_conditions.html 

I also called&amp;verfied myself. Good Luck! Remeber you have 30 days to ask for a RMA# to return the product.

INGREDIENTS ARE:

Avena Sativa, Caladium SeguiLook up each herb, root, above&amp;then you can see what they actually do. I went to school with a girl who was chinese her aunt had a shop in China town&amp;sold herbs that she rolls up in paper&amp;then the client smokes it-the results are not smoking anymore!!!! The cost is 50 bucks but this is the REAL old school chinese herbs remedy- that you probably wont be able to find if you google it. BUt you can in China Town….if your close.num, Daphne Indica, Eugenia Jambosa, Plantago Major and Tabacum,
Kali Phosphoricum, Nux vomica, Staphysagria, Purified Water, Citric Acid and Potassium Sorbate

Clubber,
I don’t know the percentage success rate (or lack of it) with Smoke Remedy but YOUR story seems like BS to me.

What evidence do you have that the testimonials were falsified? If you actually have any evidence then why not present it?

If you got charged after you canceled within the trial period that is disturbing, but that doesn’t speak to the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the product. There are companies out there with good products but their customer service and billing depts are horrific.

But to state as a fact that the testimonials are fake when you have no evidence of that says more about you than the company in question.

The service is horrible, the product makes false claims of“safe to take with prescriptions, no side effects”, and they refuse to give simple information related to their location or the address and name of the CEO. How legitimate can this company be when everything is a huge secret? They even get irate and hang up on you when you ask normal consumer questions (that is, of course, after they got their money from you). It would take days to write about my experience, but to give you a synopsis of the crap they are putting me through, I have my attorney involved right now. Thanks Diane 392 and the rest of your crew for all you have put me through. Save yourself the drama unless you don’t mind loosing the money if it doesn’t work for you. Good luck in your attempts to quit smoking…this company upset me so much that now I am smoking more than ever before. Fortunately I have an attorney in my family to advocate on my behalf…right now it’s not just the money, but also the principle.

I took this shit, and it made my balls shrink. The worst part of it all is that im a woman. You idiots, do you think if this product really worked-they would market it on a 3am infomercial? Of course this product does nothing–it is a scam!

I used the smoke remedy product for less than a week and quit smoking. Using the Lung Remedy definitely took the urge to smoke away. I used the spray a couple of times during the week, but haven’t used it after. I smoked for over 10 years and since using Smoke/Lung Remedy I haven’t had the urge to smoke in over a year now. I would strongly recommend these products. I recommend you purchase the Smoke and Lung Remedy.
