 Give Me The Brain 
( Steve Jackson Games )
 
 Available Now 

 You think working in a fast-food restaurant is hell? This place is worse. All the employees are zombies (that includes you). The jobs are repetitive and gross. The customers ask stupid questions. And all the zombies have to share a single brain . . . and they keep dropping it on the floor. 

In Give Me The Brain by James Ernest ( Lord of the Fries ), all the players are zombies, shuffling and moaning through their horrible jobs. Whoever gets rid of all his jobs first will win. Every turn, you can do a couple of things . . . and, if you&apos;re sneaky, you can also push a job or two onto the other players.

The catch? Some jobs actually require a brain . . . and there&apos;s only one in the whole restaurant . . . and the zombies keep dropping it.
