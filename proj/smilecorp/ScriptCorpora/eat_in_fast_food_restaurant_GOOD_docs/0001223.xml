Installation and Training

When you purchase or lease a new ATM machine from ATMdepot.com , the ATM will be dropped shipped directly from the manufacturer (unless other arrangements are made) to the address listed on your application.

If you want to purchase a certified refurbished ATM from us, your ATM will be shipped from our ATM processing partner preprogramed and ready to use. All you need to do is bolt it to the floor, plug in phone and power and start letting customers use it.

As far as the physical installation of the ATM , you can install it, or we can arrange for the ATM to be professionally installed for you by a certified ATM technician. We highly recommend a professional installation.

An ATM is basically a UL rated steel safe that dispenses money. The weight of an ATM machine is typically 150–250 pounds or more (depending on the model).

Most ATM’s include a rating from Underwriters Laboratory as“ UL 291 “. This is a Business Hour Vault rating and is different than a UL rating for a gun safe or heavy duty safe. It’s all based on break in time.

Your ATM should be bolted to the floor and leveled. Concrete floors are best for security. If it’s a think concrete floor and you can get underneath (down stairs ceailing) consider through bolting.

There are 4 or more predrilled holes hidden in the base of the ATM machine that are used for mounting. Installers typically bolt the ATM down with special concrete anchors call red heads or a similar product.

An ATM is then plugged into a standard 110V / AC outlet and connected to a dedicated standard phone line. If you try to connect the ATM to a fax line, a shared line or a PBX phone system you’re asking for transaction issues (delays, non-dispensing, reversals, chargebacks, incomplete transactions, non-disense issues). Save yourself the headache of problems and just install a separate phone line (it’s cheap compared to the cmall cost savings verses the issues a shared line will have). You can also use your internet service if your ATM is equipped with internet processing capability.

If you need training on how to operate you ATM, we will also arrange that during the installation if you want us to take care of that for you (no addtional charge).
 
An ATM is easier to operate than a cash register and easier to load than a napkin holder. And if you ever need help, we’re just a phone call or email away.
 
Once your ATM is installed or if you have one already we walk you thru the new programming and you are ready to fill the machine with $20s (or any denomination you pre-selected during the setup process). Dispensing $10 bills in certain places can be very advantageous. Contact us for our expertise on these issues.

A typical ATM cassette holds 700–1500 notes, although you’ll never need to use that many. If you ever do, that would be a good problem to have. Think about it, 1000–$20 dollar bills is $20,000.

The average retailer puts in 30–40 twenties per day. That’s $600–$800. Since the average ATM does 8–10 transactions and the average withdrawal is $60 that’s about $480–$600 per day. Simply remove your currency each evening if you’re the owner / operator. Otherwise if you’re an ATM Business Owner load the machine weekly and check our free online monitoring system to ensure you don’t have too much or too little cash.

If you want higher transaction counts, you can fill your ATM with $10 dollar bills instead, but they are a little harder to get from your cash register or the bank (you need to request at least 48 hours in advance). It can also be harder to obtain nice $10 bills and those don’t dispense as well since they are not as new ($10′s are used more frequently and get worn faster). Twenty-dollar bills are typically newer and easier to find at banks.

If you want to dispense more than one denomination, you can, but it requires a machine that uses multiple cassettes. A single cassette is standard and on most machines and a second can be purchased as an option. Some higher end ATM machines come standard with two cassettes.

In most cases, you (the owner) set the surcharge amount for using the machine. The surcharge is usually $1.50–$2.00 for a convenience store, fast food restaurant or other standard retailer. Some nightclubs and bars will set the fee at $2.50 or more. Fees at adult bars, casinos and other specialty shops can reach $5 or more.

Just remember that if you set the convenience fee too high, no one will use your ATM. There is a point where the cost of convenience is just too much. Our experience shows that if you charge $1.75–$2.50 your machine will make money.

To keep the ATM running all you need is the phone line (or internet service), clean power (not shared with refrigerators, coolers, freezers, compressors or any other high demand devices), a few dozen $20s and receipt paper. Just put money in every morning and take it out every night like a cash register. It only takes a minute or two.

Press a few keys to balance out and run your totals. You can also use our online monitoring system to check your balance and reports. All the money that was withdrawn from your ATM machine is deposited into your business checking account as described here . Your monthly income from the surcharge is deposited at the end of each month.
