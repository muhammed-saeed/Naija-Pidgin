Tips for Robke&apos;s Country Inn

 FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO DINE. I went to this place for lunch once or twice and it was good, so I thought I would try dinner there. What a HUGE Disappointment especially when you are really hungry and looking to have a nice dining experience. Besides the horrible food which is all overpriced for what you get; the noise level was extremely loud, the Waitress was in a rush and didn&apos;t really seem to care about anything except for getting a tip...and furthermore they don&apos;t take credit cards!. The Sole didn&apos;t taste fresh and the Shrimp were smaller than baby shrimp and only a handful of them were on the plate. The Clams Oregenata as an appetizer were worse than the Sole, and the size and quality of the Clams were next to nothing, not to mention the bland sauce they threw on top. I would have to say the food at Robke&apos;s Country Inn is heat and serve and short order cook style, and 10x the price of a Fast Food Restaurant. The people dining here must be drunk and/or their taste buds are non-existent. So if you are planning on spending Big Bucks on a meal I would steer clear of this joint and spend your evening on some nice fine dinning where you will be satisfied, have a pleasant environment and get your monies worth. …

 Huge Disappointment - I won&apos;t be back. They will not see my money again.. Disappointing. I will not be back. They will not see my money again. Used to dine here at least twice a month years ago. Was a great place. We moved out of the community, but decided to pop in for dinner on Sunday night, Nov 16, 2008. What a difference 10 years makes. Food was overpriced for what we got, was charged for bleu cheese dressing for our salad (was not advised of this when we were offered the choice, that&apos;s just bad business), they do not take credit cards (not mentioned anywhere inside or on the door), very salty food. After the fact, we checked the menu online and it does not even agree to what is currently used. Prices are lower online, and the bleu cheese thing is actually listed under appetizers. The site also did mention about the no credit card thing. Who doesn&apos;t take credit cards these days. Most people do not carry that much cash. Especially for a $100 dinner on a Sunday night. They are lucky I did have cash at the end of a weekend. When I told them I might not have enough cash, they told me to go across the street to an ATM. Nice, and pay the ATM fees on top of dinner. I told them if I walk out the door, I am not coming back. …

 cash only. not great when you are informed that they only take cash and look at your credit card in horror. Get with the times. It is 2007. Most people don&apos;t even carry cash anymore. We would not go back based on the fact that they only accept cash. …
