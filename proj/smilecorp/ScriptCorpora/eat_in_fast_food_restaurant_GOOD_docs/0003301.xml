In n Out is and always will be great! I don&apos;t think I will ever get over it. Ever since I learned about animal style, I get a double double animal style with animal style fries and I&apos;m completely satisfied afterwards. I can&apos;t help but finish the burger quickly, and then wish I had a few more bites left...then I move onto the animal style fries until I&apos;m stuffed.

This time we stopped at In n Out because we were on our way back from San Francisco and stopped in Kettleman City for gas and food. We weren&apos;t exactly hungry at that time, but knew that we were going to be at some point and wanted to make the rest of the trip nonstop to Long Beach, so we stopped for some food. I just got a double double animals style and my friend got cheese fries and asked for spread on the side. It&apos;s her way of pretty much getting animal style fries, without paying for them. hahaha it&apos;s much cheaper to just get cheese fries with spread on the side.

This In n Out is pretty good and VERY quick for being out in the middle of nowhere. We got our food in less than 10 minutes and the place was extremely packed since it was dinner time for travelers. We even found a table for two and sat and prepared ourselves for the rest of our long journey home.

If you find yourself stopping in Kettleman City, be sure to make In n Out your quick lunch/dinner choice because you won&apos;t be disappointed.

I love how In&amp;Out are always located by a freeway so they can lure you in with the smell of their food. Stop here to eat in the nice AC&apos;d restaurant.

The best kind of California fast food and an ideal pit stop in the middle of nowhere.

An oasis on 41 and 5 to experience the best burgers, and the service isn&apos;t awful just because it&apos;s in such a remote place such as Kettleman City, CA, the place no one can find on the map if you dared them to.

Good for the hungry astronomer who is out on 41&apos;s dark nights in the fields!

who doesn&apos;t like In N Out?! I was so scared I would miss the exit for this! It&apos;s the perfect pitstop to make when school gets out and you&apos;re driving home from LA to norcal! They have a few fast food joints to choose from around here including starbucks and gas stations too, but of course in n out is the best. This is probably one of the largest In N Outs i&apos;ve been to, and the customer service was super friendly and fast! Food was fresh as always and the shakes were delish.

I am not a fan of fast foods but when we are on long drives like we were for here, In-N-Out is definitely a good option.....I don&apos;t eat much of red meat (especially after driving post cow country Coalinga) so the fact that In-N-Out has the option of a vegetarian sandwich works great for me.

Everything is fresh, the fries are homemade (brings it home for me), and of course the milkshakes are fantastic

One things new..... they now have the option of getting peppers but they keep it in the back counter so if you ever wants some you&apos;ll have to ask!

This place brings back memories of middle school. At the end of every year, my class and I would take a trip down to the Mojave Desert and engage in fun activities which included but were not limited to petting rattlesnakes, learning how to fix flat tires on the spot and learning how overrated hot days are. As we drove back to the San Francisco Bay area each year, we would always stop at the InNOut burger in Kettleman City because our science teacher loved InNOut and says he knows the location of every single one in California (I haven&apos;t tested him fully but on other trips, his knowledge of random InNOut suggests he may be telling the truth.)

It would usually be extremely hot in late May (yes, our teachers decided late May was a better time for the trip instead of late January,) and us cranky middle schoolers would be tired and more than glad to stop here on our way back.

There would always be a line here as the other highway goers would stop here too. I would then grab my fantastic InNOut cheeseburger and sit down with the rest of the class. The burgers always seemed to come quickly and it was a relief to be walking on land again after sitting in the car for about six hours. As always, the InNOut burgers were very good. They made me feel excited and ready to complete the rest of the drive (which goes by quite quickly.)

In 8th grade, we had driven through the Techachipi Mountains and they were very cold and I had to sit in an open jeep wrapped in my sleeping bag. I felt so relieved to be leaving the cold finally and being able to sit in the sun at InNOut. It told me the trip was almost over although my teacher&apos;s amazing playlist for the car ride did not hurt either (although the wind made it hard to hear the music sometimes.) I then thought the playlist blew out of the jeep but a few days later, the teacher found it and gave it to me as a reminder of the trip.

Overall, this InNOut deserves five stars for bringing back these memories and showing me how things can always get better, even if you are feeling cold and worried about the rest of the drive. Just pop an InNOut burger into your mouth and feel ready to drive happily into the sunset.

This In N Out has the same great quality burgers I&apos;ve come to expect from In N Out; it could have earned a five star rating from me if not for the sloooooooowwwww service.

What idjit builds an In N Out with such a small dining area in a Mega Rest Stop complex? The customers are all packed in there like cattle so I suppose it makes sense that the guy calling our numbers is yelling them out stockyard style. 5 minutes to get through a 3-deep line, 15 more minutes more to get the food. No room to dine in on a Thursday at 5:30pm. Nice planning. I spot a table with friends outside and squeeze in on the edge of the bench.

But the double double is hot and good. The strawberry shake is the perfect counterpoint. Slowly I revive and climb back aboard the tour bus...

-A little more overpriced than at most In-N-Out&apos;s I&apos;ve been to (by just 10 cents)
-Rather stingy on the lettuce
-my grilled onions were cold.
-sort-of convenient location for my frequent &quot;Bay to LA&quot; drives

...all result in 3 stars for an In-N-Out chain. Improve on those areas and they&apos;ll be matched with the 5 star locations I&apos;ve been to.

I don&apos;t know how I would have survived driving back and forth between home (Sacramento) and school (UCSB) for 4 years without this place.

Thank you, In-N-Out at Kettleman City....Thank you. Not just for the food, but for what you represent: getting the hell off I-5 and crossing over to the 101.

(But let&apos;s not get started on the return trip, when you represent the opposite....)

Glad they&apos;re open late for late night travelers like myself.  It was pretty quiet for a Friday night but they were still open and we were out the door within 5 minutes.  My cousin and I did use the restroom first and the odor was unbreathable.  It may just have been one customer causing this so I don&apos;t blame the restaurant.

We only ordered a vanilla milkshake but I must say, that vanilla milkshake kept me going for another 3 hours to San Jose!  It was delicious.  Best milkshakes I have tried have been from In-N-Out burger.

Great place to stop when you are doing the I-5.  It&apos;s usually very busy so be prepared to wait a few minutes.  The staff is very energetic and friendly just like any other In-N-Out Burger.  It&apos;s very close to a number of gas stations too.  Hard to find a better I-5 stop except for the mega-huge one at the foot of the Grapevine.

This review really isn&apos;t about the food, because every In-N-Out is awesome.  Not to say that this one isn&apos;t awesome either, because it is.

No, we&apos;re talking about the strategically fantastic location of this In-N-Out.  You know how the Barstow In-N-Out is one of the most popular because it&apos;s on the way to and from Vegas?  Same difference.

Driving from SoCal to NorCal (or vice versa)...you&apos;re hungry, you&apos;re tired, you just want to get off the damn road...and you see nirvana.  No, it&apos;s not a mirage, it&apos;s really an In-N-Out.  Go get a Double-Double animal style, go get some animal fries, and get a shake to wash that down with.  It makes that drive that much more bearable.

Been to better In-N-Out&apos;s, this one suffers a bit from the craziness of the location with everyone getting off the freeway for their burger fix.  My usual double double is always good though, so no complaints on the burger.

Kettleman city, the halfway point from Bay Area to LA and back means perfect location for an in-n-out.

Long drives means I crave for in-n-out, so I was ecstatic around 9pm when I saw the in-n-out sign through the darkness.

Like all in-n-out locations, the burgers here still tasted amazing even though its in the middle of nowhere!

This is the only In-n-Out located within a 20 mile radius of the halfway point of the drive between our place in NPB and my adorable granddaughter, TJ!

In-n-Out in Kettleman City keeps hope alive when it seems that the entire world is reduced to:

- Big rig convoys that are trying pass each other on hills (and slowing traffic to 20 miles per hour for everybody while doing so);

- The self appointed freeway speed monitors, driving below the posted speed limit in order to block those crazy drivers who may want to get somewhere at 75-80 mph;

- The completely oblivious drivers, speeding up as you go by, only to get in front of you and then slow down just as precipitously (new invention alert, Clifford...&quot;cruise control&quot;), changing lanes on a whim, just as you&apos;re about to go by them (never signaling the lane change...that would just make it too easy for other drivers), and;

- The unchanging and often desolate landscape that is the I-5 corridor.

So when the signs say &quot;20 miles to Kettleman City&quot;, the Beautiful Carin and I always start singing one of our favorite songs!

No, not show tunes (not that I don&apos;t enjoy a good show tune...I do)...no, we start singing about the joy of getting a decent In-n-Out burger at Kettleman City...a song that I wrote all by myself!

I know you are asking yourself &quot;Why does Donald only give four stars for this delightful oasis at the caravansary on the trade route between NPB and San Jose&quot;?

&quot;I know he loves In-n-Out...he constantly compares other burgers to In-n-Out&quot;.

&quot;So, Why&quot;?

Well, as some of the other Yelp correspondents have noted, the place (esp. the loo&apos;s) could be cleaner.

I know, that may be a lot to ask, given the sheer mass of human traffic (not to mention ovine and bovine traffic in this part of California) that wanders in past the crossed palms on a daily basis.

But I have come to expect the very best from In-n-Out over the years, both in terms of a terrific and well crafted burger for very little money, and in terms of not having the powerful aroma of urine and poop overwhelming me when I walk in (taking my appetite down a peg or two in the process).

I generally solve the problem by using the drive through at this location...but sometimes it&apos;s nice to get out of the car, stretch your legs and enjoy your double/double (mustard style), fries (well done) and Diet Coke (no amendments needed).

Maybe they should hire permanent restroom attendants for this location.

Still, in-n-Out and Ketteleman City are one of the bright spots in this particular drive and so for that, four shiny, orangey stars!
