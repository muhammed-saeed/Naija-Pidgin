 Introduction - Full , free online text - Romeo and Juliet
 This section contains the free online text of Romeo and Juliet the famous Shakespearean play. The enduring works of the great Bard feature many famous and well loved characters. The full online text and script of Romeo and Juliet convey vivid impressions. The language used today is, in many ways, different to that used in the 16th century Elizabethan era and this is often reflected in the script and text used in Shakespearean plays. It is therefore not surprising that we have no experience or understanding of some of the words contained in the text / script of Romeo and Juliet. We have therefore included a free online  Shakespeare Dictionary for most of the more obscure words used in the script and text of his plays, some of which are obsolete in modern language or Dictionaries. Make a note of any unusual words or text that you encounter whilst reading the online text of the play and then check their definition in the free online Shakespeare Dictionary.

William Shakespeare never published any of his plays and therefore none of the original manuscripts have survived. Eighteen unauthorised versions of his plays were, however, published during his lifetime in quarto editions by unscrupulous publishers (there were no copyright laws protecting Shakespeare and his works during the Elizabethan era). A collection of his works did not appear until 1623 ( a full seven years after Shakespeare&apos;s death on April 23, 1616) when two of his fellow actors, John Hemminges and Henry Condell, posthumously recorded his work and published 36 of Williams plays in the First Folio.
