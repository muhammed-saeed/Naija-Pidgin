Starting a Yogurt Shop


 Are you interested in owning a food stall? You have a variety of choices in this line of business, but if you want to sell something sweet, less the calories, you can sell frozen yogurt, which is a popular and healthier alternative to ice cream. Learn from our basic guide some information and tips about starting this business. 

Starting a yogurt shop is an idea you can pursue if you want to enter into the food business, particularly in the frozen dessert business.

 

Yogurt is a popular alternative to ice cream because of its lower fat content and health benefits, making it a dessert for everyone, including those who watch their calorie intake and the lactose intolerant.

Yogurt Shop Essentials

To start a yogurt shop you need to have an idea where to put up your store. You have the choice of the mall, the beach or any busy recreational area such as a park. You will also need equipment, the most important of which is an ice cream maker. You might also want a yogurt dispensing freezer to save on space. Then you would need a counter and cash register. You will also need supplies like cups, cones and spoons.

Yogurt Shop Menu

For your menu, you would have to work out a combination of yogurt flavors and toppings. You don’t have to have many flavors, even just two will do (vanilla, chocolate and green tea are some of your choices). But splurge on toppings. Offer a wide variety of fresh fruit toppings like raspberries, strawberries, peaches, mangoes, pineapples. You can also use other ingredients like cereal or chocolate chips.

For the yogurt, find a local creamery that sells the product wholesale so you can buy it at lower prices. You can also use yogurt powder for soft serve frozen yogurt. Frozen yogurt may also contain other ingredients like sweetener, gelatin, and flavoring. To set yourself apart from competition, you can venture into organic natural yogurt, non-dairy yogurt, or sugar-free yogurt.

While flavor and topping combinations are endless, take note of the proportion of your yogurt and flavoring (or toppings). It should be such that the yogurt is not all there is to your product, and that the toppings do not overpower the flavors.

Yogurt Shop Financials

For all of these, you would need capital to buy equipment, supplies, and enter into a lease for the space or kiosk that you will be using for your yogurt shop. Add to that is the money you will have to spend in the day-to-day operation, which should be enough for a few months until the business generates a profit. And remember that yogurt business is seasonal.

There are also frozen yogurt businesses that you can franchise. You can start a yogurt shop for $10,000. Franchising will cost more but that will already include payments for training, insurance and advertising.

I&apos;ve been on a crusade to find it, and I am having no luck. I&apos;m looking to find a yogurt mix supplier for my shop that will be in Idaho. I need a no sugar added mix that is low in calories. There seems to be only 1 or 2 manufacturers, and I know there has got to be more out there somewhere. I also need a mix that is sweetened with a sugar substitute, and low calorie like splenda. It Does need to be frozen yogurt. I know the options would be easier if it were ice cream. Please help me with this as soon as possible.

I can tell you guys it is much more work than I expected but it is getting better now you really need enough money to start this business I mean do your business plan well especially your finance plan!!!!!!!!!! the biggest cost at the beginning are the machines, rent and of course the shop fitting and you need to get the initial stock like yogurt, milk and fruits, sweets e.g.

but guys remember I can tell you that there is much much more like insurance, business tax, accountant and much much much more and all the small equipment like blender, cups or uniform, website adds up so quickly I dont know how much you will need in the states but here in London you already need at least 100.000 Pounds so I guess over there you should have more than 150.000 dollars. And remember guys cashflow, cashflow , cashflow!!! you must have enough money to survive the first 3 months!!! plan this into your business plan otherwise you can even buy more stock while you havent made any money and thats the beginning of the end! so if you guys have any questions please feel free to contact me 228. renu on 3/7/2012 3:28:03 AM i have experience in frozen yogurt for three years...and have the best recipe,my customer are mostly repeated and have compared me to some of the most branded fro yo company, i have just dont have the capital to expand in Singapore as the rentals are to high.my shop has also came in strait times singapore and have the best remarks out of the most widely spread companies. i would love to help company overseas to promote and set up. my goal is to spread my recipe for low volume.its a waste if my recipe is not spread just cause my capital is low i just cant establish and would love to see anyone grow through that.

 236. Dustin Oehler on 4/20/2012 10:22:31 AM @everyone - Folks starting a Frozen Yogurt concept is an expensive venture. A few items to consider as you begin to write your business plan. The frozen yogurt machines cost between $13,500 - $18,000 each. A very large investment. Make sure that you do your homework on the machines. Buying used is NOT a good choice. You will need working capital to sustain for at least 6 months depending on your geographic location. If you have additional questions please feel free to contact me.
