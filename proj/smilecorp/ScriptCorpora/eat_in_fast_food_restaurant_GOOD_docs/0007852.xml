 History 
 Jodhpur Panorama , seen from the Mehrangarh Fort . 
This area was part of the Gurjara - Pratihara empire and till 1100 CE was ruled by a powerful Bargujar King. Jodhpur was founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha , a Rajput chief of to the Rathore clan . Rao Jodha succeeded in conquering the surrounding territory and thus founded a state which came to be known as Marwar . As Rao Jodha hailed from the nearby town of Mandore , that town initially served as the capital of this state; however, Jodhpur soon took over that role, even during the lifetime of Rao Jodha. The city was located on the strategic road linking Delhi to Gujarat . This enabled it to profit from a flourishing trade in opium , copper , silk , sandals , date palms and coffee .

Early in its history, the state became a fief under the Mughal Empire , owing fealty to them while enjoying some internal autonomy . During this period, the state furnished the Mughals with several notable generals such as Maharaja Jaswant Singh . Jodhpur and its people benefited from this exposure to the wider world: new styles of art and architecture made their appearance and opportunities opened up for local tradesmen to make their mark across northern India.

[[Image:JODHPUR 1960.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Rajasthan \s, who soon supplanted the Mughals as overlords of the region. This did not make for stability or peace, however; 50 years of wars and treaties dissipated the wealth of the state, which sought and gratefully entered into subsidiary alliance with the British in 1818.

During the British Raj , the state of Jodhpur had the largest land area of any in Rajputana. Jodhpur prospered under the peace and stability that were a hallmark of this era.The land area of the state was 23543 mi² its population in 1901 was 44,73,759. It enjoyed an estimated revenue of £ 35,29,000/. Its merchants, the Marwaris , flourished without let or limit and came to occupy a position of dominance in trade across India. In 1947, when India became independent, the state merged into the union of India and Jodhpur became the second city of Rajasthan.

Oswal Jains were mainly concentrated in Gorwar Region which was again ruled by Maharaja of Jodhpur . And Oswal jains also played main role in strengthening foundation of Jodhpur by donating mass wealth , gems to Maharaja of Jodhpur&amp;in turn Maharaja of Jodhpur used to honour these wealthy Oswal Jain Merchants as Nagar Seth or various other honourable titles.

At the time of partition, ruler of Jodhpur Hanwant Singh didn&apos;t want to join India, but finally due to the effective leadership of Sardar Vallab Patel the then Home Minister at centre princely state of Jodhpur was included in Indian Republic. Later after State Reorganization Act, 1956 it was made part of the state of Rajasthan. [ 3 ] BWhw ). Although the average rainfall is around 360 millimetres (14 in), it is extraordinarily variable. In the famine year of 1899, Jodhpur received only 24 millimetres (0.94 in), but in the flood year 1917 it received as much as 1,178 millimetres (46.4 in).

Temperatures are extreme throughout the period from March to October, except when monsoonal rain produces thick clouds to lower it slightly. During these periods of heavy rain, however, the generally low humidity rises and this adds to the normal discomfort from the heat.

 Monuments 

A number of historical monuments dot the city and surrounding region. Some of these monuments are described here.

 Umaid Bhawan Palace 
 The Umaid Bhawan Palace. 
The Umaid Bhawan Palace is not only one of India&apos;s most imposing palaces but also among its most recent. This lavish art deco monument to royal living had an improbable conception: it was built as a public relief and employment project during a long period of drought. Over one million square feet (90,000 m²) of the finest marble was used in the construction of the palace. A special type of sandstone, called Chittar sandstone, has been used in constructing the palace and this gives it a special effect. For this reason, it is also referred to as Chittar Palace by the locals. Its style of construction, with beautiful balconies, charming courtyards, green gardens and stately rooms, makes it a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The project employed three thousand artisans over a period of 15 years (1929-1943). The palace is named after its builder, Maharaja Umaid Singh (1876-1947), who was incidentally the president of the British Royal Institute of Architects. In 1977, the palace was segmented into the royal residence, the Heritage Hotel and a museum. It has total 347 rooms.It is the biggest private residence in the world, out of which 98 air-conditioned rooms are elegantly decorated with antique furniture as well as all the other amenities for a five star hotel.

 Mehrangarh Fort 

[[Image:Meherangarh Fort 1.jpg|thumb|The iconic Mehrangarh Fort ]] The Mehrangarh Fort lies at the outskirts of Jodhpur city and is located atop a 125 m high hill. The magnificent Mehrangarh Fort (Jodhpur ka kila) is the most majestic and one of the largest forts in India. It was originally started (c.1459) by Rao Jodha, founder of Jodhpur. However, most of the extant fort dates from the period of Jaswant Singh (1638-78). The walls of the fort are up to 36 m high and 21 m wide; they enclose some exquisite structures. The fort museum houses an exquisite collection of palanquins, howdahs, royal cradles, miniatures, musical instruments, costumes and furniture. The ramparts of Mehrangarh Fort provide not only excellently preserved cannons but also a breath-taking view of the city.

 Jaswant Thada 

The Jaswant Thada is architectural landmark found in Jodhpur. It is a white marble memorial built in 1899 in memory of Maharaja Jaswant Singh II. The monument, in its entirety, is built out of intricately carved sheets of marble. These stones are extremely thin and polished so that they emit a warm glow when the sun&apos;s rays dance across their surface. Within this cenotaph, there are also two more tombs.
 The Osiyan temple is one of the most famous temples in Jainism . 
 Osiyan Temple 

An ancient temple, well worth the visit, lies in the village of Osiyan , about 60 km outside Jodhpur. It is believed that all the Oswal (a Major Jain community) originated from Osiyan. There are many sections of this temple, which was built in several distinct phases.

 Jodhpur is the second largest city in the state

 The Blue City of Brahmpur from the ramparts of Mehrangarh
Fort 
 
 Did you know? 

The word jodhpurs owes
its etymology to this city. (riding breeches, cut at the hips but
tight fitting from knee to ankle, usually worn while riding horses
or playing polo).
 

Jodhpur is a historic city and the origin dates to the year 1459
AD when it was founded by Rao Jodha, the Rajput chieftan of the
Rathores. The Rathore kingdom was also known as the Marwar and was the largest in
Rajputana.

The city was built as the new capital of the state of Marwar (now Rajasthan) to replace the ancient
capital Mandore, the ruins of which can be seen near what is now
the Mandore Gardens. The people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas
are hence also commonly called as Marwaris.

Jodhpur is also known as the Blue City , an apt
name as most houses in the old city are shades of blue. This is
particularly noticeable on the north side of the town, known as Brahmpuri for the many Brahmins that live
there.

The forts and palaces, temples and havelis, culture and
tradition, spices and fabrics, colour and texture, a booming
handicrafts industry, all add up to make this historic city worth a
visit.

 Mehrangarh Fort Moti Mahal Zenana Deodi 
 Mehrangarh Fort [8] dominates the city and is the largest fort in all
Rajasthan. Founded in 1458 as the site of Rao Jodha&apos;s new capital —
hence the name, Jodhpur — the city has grown around it, and in the
500 years that have passed the fort has never been taken by force.
It&apos;s easy to see why: it occupies the entire top of a 150-meter
hill with commanding views all around, with some three kilometers
of massive ramparts built around the edges.

The name &quot;fort&quot; belies the size of the complex, which houses the
Maharaja&apos;s palace, several temples and, tucked away in the back, an
extensive garden still farmed to this day. Highlights within the
palace include:

 Moti Mahal (Pearl Hall). Pearl-colored inside
and decorated with colored glass windows, this is where the
Maharaja held his audiences, with the five alcoves on the far wall
allowing his queens to listen in. 

 Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Hall). Just what the name
says. 

 Phool Mahal (Flower Hall). The most
extravagant of them all, this was the Maharaja&apos;s pleasure chamber,
for dancing girls and revelry. 

 Zenana Deodi . The inner sanctum of the palace
once guarded by eunuchs, this is where the Maharaja&apos;s wives whiled
away their days. The delicate sandstone screens and carvings are
exquisite. 

 Chamunda Mataji Temple . Tucked away at the far
end of the battlements, this temple is devoted to Rao Jodha&apos;s
favorite goddess and remains a local favorite to this day. 

A number of people are employed here and there to add flavor by
dressing in period costume and doing photogenic things like playing
traditional instruments and smoke opium (yes, the real thing). Snap
away, but they&apos;ll appreciate a tip if you do. The museum also
includes galleries devoted to howdahs (elephant-mounted
seats), palanquins, fine arts, weaponry, and the inevitable Turban Gallery .

Entry to Mehrangarh costs Rs.250, including still camera fee and
an excellent audioguide available in six languages. A rickshaw from
the city will cost around Rs.30, or you can try to pick your way
through the alleys up on foot. Open 9AM-5PM daily.
 Jaswant Thada 
 Jaswant Thada , 1 km downhill from Mehrangarh
( easily walked ). Royal cenotaphs built in marble, with a
picturesque location next to a little lake. Entry Rs. 20, plus Rs.
25 for a camera. Mandore , 7 km outside the city. The ancient
capital of Marwar, before Jodhpur was built. Umaid Bhawan Palace . Clearly visible to the
south of the city and completed only in 1944, this is the last
great palace built in India. The Maharaja of Jodhpur lives here to
this day, but half the building has been converted to a 5-star
hotel (see Sleep) and there is also a small museum on grounds (Rs.
50, open 9 AM to 5 PM). You&apos;ll have to take a rickshaw to get here,
and it&apos;s best to ask them to wait: figure on Rs. 100 for a
round-trip with an hour&apos;s waiting time. Khejarla Fort , located 85 kms. from the main
city. Situated in a rural setting, the 400-year-old, Fort Khejarla
offers guests an enlivening experience. The stunning red sandstone
monument is a mesmerizing example of the architecture of the
Rajputs. The rugged exterior contradicts an inner paradise with a
striking blend of art and architecture leaving one with a
magnificent aura! The spellbound grandeur of the Fort offers
picturesque settings, latticework friezes, and intricate Jharokas
that at once transports you back in time to experience the majesty
of a long-gone era of valour and chivalry. 

To reach Khejarla from Jodhpur, head on Jodhpur Jaipur highway
for 73 Kms. You&apos;ll cross Bhavi village and a railway crossing.
After railway crossing go 3.5 kms and take a left turn. Then go
straight for 12 kms and you&apos;ll find Khejarla fort. (Visit http://www.jodhpurfortkhejarla.com )

 Balsamand Lake - now converted to a
resort Kailana Lake - a picnic spot and a main
drinking water source for the city Ranisar Padamsar - Ranisar was made by Queen
Jasmade Hadi, Rao Jodha&apos;s wife in 1459. Ranisar is situated near

National Law University [11] , this is one of four
major Universities in India specializing in Law.
 Fabrics for sale, Sardar Market 
The city&apos;s main shopping drag is Nai Sadak ,
lined mostly with sari and shoe shops and leading straight into Sardar Market , a full-on bustling Indian market
with a barely contained riot of sights, sounds and stinks. The
clocktower in the center is a useful orientation point. Popular
souvenirs include:

 Bandhej sarees and dress material Mojris or Jootis. Shoes with a pointed front,
a must-have accessory if you plan on dressing like a Rajput
Maharaja. Handicrafts these are handmade (made to look
like old antiques), the handicraft industry is a booming industry
in this city. 

One shop stands out from the crowd:

 National Handloom , Nai Sadak ( and three
other outlets around the city ). A four-story shop easily
identified by their logo of a gloriously mustachioed and turbaned
man, the jumble of items inside is authentically Indian, but prices
are cheap, clearly marked, and hassle-free. The fourth story houses
handicrafts and art, with most of the rest devoted to clothes. 

 Nitisha ,Located at Raikabad, Near Rajmata
School. The store does readymade garments for both men and women,
silver and semi precious stones jewellery, cushions, bedsheets and
bedcovers, fragrances, gift items, souvenirs, candles, gift packing
material, show pieces and handicrafts, gift packaging accessories
at great rates. All prices are clearly marked on the items and thus
there is no chance of quoting high prices.

 Gypsy , Sardarpura - Fast food restaurant,
quite crowded often but food is delicious. Cafe Mehran , Meherangarh Fort. Simple but
pleasant cafe in the fort itself, with a range of tourist favorites
from pizza to burgers as well as Indian thalis. Rs.60-140. Omelette Shop (aka Garib
Hotel ), just outside the gates to the main square. A bit
of a cult favorite, although controversy and confusion have been
stoked by a Lonely Planet recommendation, which has inspired signs
all over the area claiming the mantle of the &quot;real&quot; Omelette Shop.
Five yards away is the up and coming Vicky , whose
omelettes are identical except for the noticeable increase in the
amount of ginger. There is no place to sit, so don&apos;t come here
expecting to relax with your omelette. Shahi Samosas , Nai Sawak ( left side just
before main gate to Sardar Market ). Easily spotted thanks to
the neverending queue, their samosas and kachoris are made in front
of your eyes with generous amounts of stuffing. Rs.6-8. New Saheen Hotel (restaurant) , 9166531533 -
Very nice restaurant busy with locals, not touristy at all. For
about Rs. 60-80 you can try out several different dishes. Selection
includes fish, kababs, dal, paneer and of course fresh roti with
ghee, etc. Kitchen in same space as sitting area, a treat on all
senses. Highly recommended. On the second floor of a building,

but service is quite slow. Chilly and Garlic , Residency Road - A nice and
cozy garden restaurant. Its a small place but good service and
wonderful for family outing 

 Pillars , Umaid Bhawan Palace, [12] . Gorgeous setting in the countyard of the palace, and the
quality of the food is very high -- as is the price: there&apos;s a
Rs.1500 minimum for non-guests, and you can easily reach that with
a main, an appetizer and a drink. Non-guests may be turned away if
the hotel is full, so call ahead to avoid disappointment.

 Stay safe 

This is a comparatively safe city, however it is advisable not
to venture out late in the night alone.

While travelling in trains or buses, avoid any snacks offered by
seemingly well meaning strangers. There have been some incidents
where tourists or even locals have been drugged and looted after
consuming narcotic-laced biscuits or tea.

Though the incidents of rape or sexual assualt are far and few
in between, women should avoid wearing revealing clothes in public
places since hooligans are known to chase the girls and may cause
harm. Try to move around with a couple of male friends.

Beware of touts selling rail tickets or promising reservations
on trains. It is a criminal offence to buy and sell tickets except
from recognized agents or the reservation offices.

 1911 encyclopedia 
 Up to date as of January 14, 2010 
From LoveToKnow 1911
 
 JODHPUR, or Marwar, a native state of India , in the Rajputana agency. Area, 34,963 sq. m. Pop.
(1901), 1,935,565, showing a decrease of 23% in the decade, due to
the results of famine .
Estimated revenue, £373,600; tribute , £14,000. The general aspect of the
country is that of a sandy plain, divided into two unequal parts by
the river Luni, and dotted with picturesque conical hills,
attaining in places an elevation of 3000 ft. The river Luni is the
principal feature in the physical aspects of Jodhpur. One of its
head-streams rises in the sacred lake of Pushkar in Ajmere , and the main river flows through Jodhpur in a
south- westerly direction
till it is finally lost in the marshy ground at the head of the Runn of Cutch . It
is fed by numerous tributaries and occasionally overflows its banks , fine crops of wheat and barley being grown on the saturated soil. Its
water is, as a rule, saline or brackish, but comparatively sweet
water is obtained from wells sunk at a distance of 20 or 30 yds. from the river bank . The famous salt-lake of Sambhar is situated on the
borders of Jodhpur and Jaipur ,
and two smaller lakes of the same description lie within the limits
of the state, from which large quantities of salt are extracted. Marble is mined in the north of the state and
along the south-east border.

The population consists of Rathor Rajputs (who form the ruling
class), Brahmans, Charans, Bhats, Mahajans or traders, and Fats.
The Charans, a sacred race, hold large religious grants of land,
and enjoy peculiar immunities as traders in local produce. The
Bhats are by profession genealogists, but also engage in trade.
Marwari traders are an enterprising class to be found throughout
the length and breadth of India.

The principal crops are millets and pulses, but wheat and barley
are largely produced in the fertile tract watered by the Luni
river. The manufactures comprise leather boxes and brass utensils; and turbans and scarfs and a
description of embroidered silk knotted thread are
specialities of the country.

The Maharaja belongs to the Rathor clan of Rajputs. The family chronicles relate that
after the downfall of the Rathor dynasty of Kanauj in 1194, Sivaji , the grandson of Jai Chand, the last king
of Kanauj, entered Marwar on a pilgrimage to Dwarka, and on halting at the
town of Pali he and his followers
settled there to protect the Brahman community from the constant raids of
marauding bands. The Rathor chief thus laid the foundation of the
state, but it was not till the time of Rao Chanda , the tenth in succession from Sivaji,
that Marwar was actually conquered. His grandson Jodha founded the
city of Jodhpur, which he made his capital. In 1561 the country was
invaded by Akbar , and the chief
was forced to submit, and to send his son as a mark of homage to take service under the Mogul emperor . When this son Udai Singh succeeded to
the chiefship, he gave his sister Jodhbai in marriage to Akbar, and
was rewarded by the restoration of most of his former possessions.
Udai Singh&apos;s son, Gaj Singh, held high service under Akbar, and
conducted successful expeditions in Gujarat and the Deccan . The bigoted and intolerant Aurangzeb invaded Marwar in
1679, plundered Jodhpur, sacked all the large towns, and commanded
the conversion of the Rathors to Mahommedanism. This cemented all
the Rajput clans into a bond
of union, and a triple alliance was formed by the three states of
Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaipur,
to throw off the Mahommedan yoke. One of the conditions of this
alliance was that the chiefs of Jodhpur and Jaipur should regain
the privilege of marriage with the Udaipur family, which they had
forfeited by contracting alliances with the Mogul emperors, on the
understanding that the offspring of Udaipur princesses should
succeed to the state in preference to all other children. The
quarrels arising from this stipulation lasted through many
generations, and led to the invitation of Mahratta help from the
rival aspirants to power, and finally to the subjection of all the
Rajput states to the Mahrattas . Jodhpur was conquered by Sindhia,
who levied a tribute of £60,000, and took from it the fort and town
of Ajmere. Internecine disputes and succession wars disturbed the
peace of the early years of the century, until in January 1818
Jodhpur was taken under British protection. In 1839 the
misgovernment of the raja led to
an insurrection which compelled the interference of the British. In
1843, the chief having died without a son, and without having
adopted an heir, the nobles and state officials were left to select
a successor from the nearest of kin .
Their choice fell upon Raja Takht Sinh, chief of Ahmednagar . This chief,
who did good service during the Mutiny , died in 1873. Maharaja Jaswant Singh,
who died in 1896, was a very enlightened ruler. His brother, Sir Pertab Singh (q.v.), conducted
the administration until his nephew, Sardar Singh, came of age in
1898. The imperial service cavalry formed part of the reserve brigade during the Tirah
campaign .

The state maintains a railway running to Bikanir , and there is also a branch railway
into Sind . Gold , silver and copper money is coined.
The state emblems are a jhar or sprig of seven branches
and a khanda or sword .
Jodhpur practically escaped the plague , but it suffered more severely than any
other part of Rajputana from the famine of 1899-1900. In February
1900 more than 110,000 persons were in receipt of famine relief.

The city of Jodhpur is 64 m. by rail N.W. of
Marwar junction, on the Rajputana railway. Pop. (1901), 60,437. It
was built by Rao Jodha in 1459, and from that time has been the
seat of government. It is surrounded by a strong wall nearly 6 m.
in extent, with seventy gates. The fort, which stands on an
isolated rock, contains the maharaja&apos;s palace, a large and handsome
building, completely covering the crest of the hill on which it stands, and
overlooking the city, which lies several hundred feet below. The
city contains palaces of the maharaja, and town residences of the thakurs or nobles, besides numerous fine temples and
tanks. Building stone is plentiful and close at hand, and the architecture is solid
and handsome. Three miles north of Jodhpur are the ruins of Mandor,
the site of the ancient capital of the Parihar princes of Marwar,
before its conquest by the Rathors. Mills for grinding flour and crushing grain have been constructed for the imperial
service troops. The Jaswant college is affiliated to the B.A.
standard of the Allahabad university. To the Hewson hospital a wing for eye diseases was
added in 1898, and the Jaswant hospital for women is under an
English lady doctor .
