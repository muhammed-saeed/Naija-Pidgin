Point of purchase promotion

 Point of purchase promotion (POP), also known as point of sale advertising , refers to promotional displays positioned in the distribution channel (usually at retail) where buyers actually purchase or make the decision to purchase a product or service . Common POP display examples include:

_ Banners
_ Brochures
_ Counter displays
_ End-of-aisle displays
_ Floor-stand displays
_ Grocery bag advertisements
_ Grocery cart advertisements
_ Magnets
_ Neon beverage signs
_ POP coupon checkout machines
_ Shelf coupon dispensers
_ Shelf talkers
_ Tabletop tent cards
_ Video consoles
_ Wall posters
_ Window clings
_ Window signage

POP displays are usually produced and paid for by the sponsoring manufacturer or service firm, which may also set up and maintain the display. Typically, POP displays are found in retail outlets close to where the buyer makes the decision to purchase. Though the location of POP displays may be at the point of actual exchange, such as the check-out counter, the buying decision often occurs earlier and at a different location, such as a grocery store aisle or while the customer is in a queue at a drive-through fast food restaurant. The key difference between POP displays and other forms of advertising is the relative proximity of the promotion to the actual point where the buyerseller transaction takes place. For example, advertising in traditional media channels (newspapers, television , billboards, etc.) may take place far from the actual point of purchase. With POP displays, the promotion and purchase location coincide.

POP displays can serve a number of purposes: to build store traffic, attract attention to a specific brand , advertise a brand, or cue recall of brand advertising the buyer may have seen elsewhere. Ultimately, though, the main goal of POP displays, like that of most promotions, is to boost immediate sales. Though the POP display environment has become cluttered, studies show that well-designed and located POP displays can increase sales, sometimes dramatically. This depends on a number of factors, however, including the type of product being promoted, the nature of the decision environment (novel or repeat), and the product knowledge and brand loyalty of the buyer.

Consumer behavior research, for example, shows that many purchase decisions are stimulus based as opposed to memory-based (Peter and Olson, 1990). Stimulus-based decisions are those for which product choice is primarily influenced by information available in the purchase environment, such as product packaging and POP displays. Memory-based decisions are primarily influenced by information retrieved from memory, such as prior experience with a brand or brand advertising seen on an earlier occasion. Stimulus based decision-making is especially common for grocery products, for which estimates of purchase decisions made in the store are as high as 75%. Similarly, restaurant meal and beverage decisions are often stimulus-based decisions diners infrequently approach the restaurant experience with a well-formed purchase plan in place, but instead are persuaded by information in the decision environment, including POP displays.

POP promotion has also found utility in recruiting line employees. Many foodservice operations, particularly in the quick service and fast casual segments, use a variety of POP materials to inform customers that job openings exist. The most common of these is window signage and messages printed on the sales receipt. Researchers believe the POP recruiting is effective since such messages build on the given brand. Furthermore, potential employees see what the job entails thereby creating accurate job expectations.

This tool that has recently become commonplace for most marketers will likely gain in complexity during the foreseeable future . It is also likely that crossover marketing efforts, such as those that combine Internet -based approaches with POP promotions will continue to expand the reach of companies, particularly those in the service sector.
