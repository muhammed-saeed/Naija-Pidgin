Hello,

i like to frequent MacDonald  since during school time. I remember, I use to prepare for my exam at MacDonald outlet and i must apologize to the management for taking up the space during that time. I still visit MacDonald and sometime i bring my kid down for breakfast. The Restaurant layout and design didn’t change since the last time.

The floor tiles being use still the same and the colour concept of the restaurant remain  unchanged, The colour of the furnishing likes wall panels and the carpentry work make use of wood grain give a soft and warm feel to the restaurant.
