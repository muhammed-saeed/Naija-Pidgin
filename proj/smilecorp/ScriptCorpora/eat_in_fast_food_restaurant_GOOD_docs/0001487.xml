 MY IDEAL CURRICULUM FOR A PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE 

 by Robert M. Young 

The title given in your list of talks in this series is one
in my list of publications that caught the eye of the person who got me invited.
Instead of reciting that paper I have written a new but closely related one,
drawing on some of the ideas in that one. The new title is‘My Ideal
Curriculum for a Psychology Degree’, Perhaps I ought to be more modest and
call it‘Notes Toward My Ideal Psychology Curriculum’.

When I was a graduate student in the Department of
Experimental Psychology in Cambridge in the early 1960s I was impressed that the
head of the department, Oliver Zangwill, had fought for and succeeded in getting
the subject placed inside of the Natural Science Tripos. His motto was that‘Psychology
is a Biological Science’. Indeed, there were corridors on several floors
connecting the department to that of physiology. My own research was certainly
embarked upon under that way of locating the discipline. I set out to look at
the history of ideas about mind and brain, in particular, cerebral localization,
in the hope that brain science, especially exciting work then going on the
limbic system which was commonly called the‘emotional brain’, could act as
an objective test of the psychiatric and psychoanalytic theories which
interested me and of which I intended to be a practitioner. The resulting
monograph has, much to my surprise, come to be considered a classic (Young,
1970). My old friend and fellow graduate student, Charlie Gross, now Professor
of Psychology at Princeton and a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences,
told me last week that it is the text most plagiarized by his students. Surely
that is some sort of compliment, imitation being the sincerest form of flattery.

I remain convinced that psychology is a biological science.
Indeed, a colleague, Dr Ian Pitchford, and I maintain a web site which publishes
daily updates of findings and debates in the brain and behavioural sciences and
in evolutionary psychology which is one of the most popular of all
the 34 million web sites on the internet. We have also founded an ejournal
entitled Evolutionary Psychology, which has a distinguished board of
editors and will support ongoing discussions of the articles it publishes and
the issues they raise. Moreover, in the period since completing my doctoral
research I have spent more time researching on the place of humanity in the
biological order and have published more on this than any other topic, including
two books and dozens of articles on Darwin, evolutionary theory and the
biomedical and human sciences. All of these are available at my web site - http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/ 

I begin with all these immodest remarks to establish my bona
fides , in the hope that you will not think me a traitor, an apostate from
the true faith of science and of scientific psychology, when I spend most of my
time arguing that psychology - as I conceive it and advocate that it be taught -
is or should be much, much more than a biological science . I want to give
my reasons for saying this and then to offer a sketch of a curriculum in
psychology I would like to have been taught and to teach. I offer these remarks
in my capacity as an old man and an emeritus professor and who has been
studying, teaching and doing clinical work on human nature for just short of
half a century.
 
Of course, the question immediately arises: how can
anything about human nature not be part of biology? We evolved via the mechanism
of random mutation and natural selection. Let’s spend a few moments on this
matter. Although, as you’ll see, I have grave reservations about some of the
more ambitious claims of evolutionary psychology, I also welcome a suitably
modest version of it. However, I am in no doubt about the importance of Darwin’s
theory.

If we look at Darwin’s theory of evolution as one of the
great ideas in the history of science and of culture, we can characterise it in
two ways. Evolution ranks with gravity, the central concept in physics, and
affinity, the key idea in chemistry, as one of the most basic concepts in the
natural sciences. Beyond that, however, evolution by natural selection is a
widely applicable theory in two senses. It is the law that binds all of life
together and defines its relations with the physical environment - how the
history of living nature relates to the history of nature. And, of course, it
binds humanity by causal laws to the rest of life and of nature. Evolution by
natural selection is the process that accounts for the history of living nature,
including human nature. It is arguably the most important idea in the history of
the natural and the human sciences. Suitably interpreted, I think it is.

All of the above is fairly common knowledge, though the
breadth and depth of the scope of Darwinism is rarely adequately presented.
However, there is a huge problem, which is left unresolved -- or perhaps I
should say it is in some hands too easily resolved -- by evolution. If we take
evolution to be an all-embracing explanation of living, including human,
phenomena, then must also include human psychology, society and culture within
the causal nexus of deterministic scientific laws. If this is so, what is the
basis for the parameters of human culture and morality? Put another way, how
should we think of the role of values and morality in human nature? Is the only
truth natural science truth? At its most stark, evolution by natural selection
proceeds by competition for resources and/or mates to achieve viable offspring
that live to reproduce. How can this conception of the interrelations between
creatures be subtle enough to include processes which transcend competition -
altruism, charity, generosity, self-critical reflection, including what Darwin’s
great inspiration, T. R. Malthus, called’moral restraint’(Young, 1999)?
How can it explain the diversity of customs and mores in different cultures?
Providing such explanations is an important and controversial part of the
project of the practitioners of new Darwinian sciences, in particular Darwinian
(sometimes called Evolutionary) Psychology. The answers they have so far tended
to provide often strike me as less useful than the ones we can gain from more
traditional ones employing human purposes, consciously conceived and/or
discerned in unconscious motivations, which do not rely in any simple, direct or
obvious way on selfish genes and competition for resources and/or mates.

It seems to me to be approaching things the wrong way up to
claim that Darwinian explanations provide the most basic accounts for the
subtleties and complexities of human relations when literature, philosophy,
theology, analytical psychology and other cultural approaches evoke and explore
them so well. Perhaps I should say, rather, that it seems wrong-headed to me to
offer Darwinian explanations as superior to or as replacements for traditional explorations of such matters derived from the arts. It may well be
that evolution explains humanity and all its works, but we must still find a way
of paying due respect to established forms of reflection on human nature and not
run headlong into a single explanatory paradigm -- and a reductionist one, at
that. The general applicability of evolutionary explanation is not the same as
its replacing other explanations or as being seen as more appropriate or basic
than them. Hence we need science and the humanities; neither will do
alone now or, in my opinion, ever.

You begin to see why my proposed curriculum will move freely
across the divide usually maintained between the arts and the sciences. There is
also a deeper reason. To get a sense of it we have to put some philosophy into
our curriculum, in particular, two books that have been guiding lights for me
since I was an undergraduate. Both mount critiques of the explanatory paradigm
of modern science that was codified in the seventeenth century, especially as it
applies to psychology and the human sciences. Ren Descartes, whose Discourse
on Method , published in 1637 and often called the founding document of
modern science, was philosophically explicit about what counts as a scientific
explanation. He divided the world into two sorts of things -- extended
substances and thinking substances. Extended substances had extension, figure
and motion and made up the world of matter, while thinking substances were
defined negatively as that which does not pertain to matter, and their essence
was will. We were left with a world of minds and bodies -- since commonly called
Cartesian dualism. This radical definition of reality was very useful for
certain scientific purposes, but it left a dreadful legacy of unsolved problems,
for example, how minds and bodies interact. Many, many philosophers have
lamented this split.

Alfred North Whitehead was co-author with Bertrand Russell of Principia Mathematica , one of the great mathematical works of all time and
the foundation stone of modern symbolic logic. Late in his life Whitehead
accepted an invitation to give the Lowell Lectures at Harvard. He stood back and
reflected on Science and the Modern World, in which he had this to say
about the modern world-view:
 
The seventeenth century had finally produced a scheme of
 scientific thought framed by mathematicians, for the use of mathematicians…The enormous success of the scientific abstractions, yielding on the one
 hand matter with its simple location in space and time, on the
 other hand mind, perceiving, suffering, reasoning, but not
 interfering, has foisted onto philosophy the task of accepting them as the
 most concrete rendering of fact.

Thereby, modern philosophy has been ruined. It has
 oscillated in a complex manner between three extremes. There are the
 dualists, who accept matter and mind as on equal basis, and the two
 varieties of monists, those who put mind inside matter, and those who put
 matter inside mind. But this juggling with abstractions can never overcome
 the inherent confusion introduced by the ascription of misplaced
 concreteness to the scientific scheme of the seventeenth century
 (Whitehead, 1925, p. 70).
 
A younger contemporary of Whitehead’s who reflected on the
consequences of the world-view of modern science was Edwin Arthur Burtt who
taught at Cornell and wrote about The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern
Physical Science. Reflecting on the consequences of this world-view for any
attempt at understanding human nature, he said,
 
...it does seem like strange perversity in these
 Newtonian scientists to further their own conquests of external nature by
 loading on mind everything refractory to exact mathematical handling and
 thus rendering the latter still more difficult to study scientifically than
 it had been before. Did it never cross their minds that sooner or later
 people would appear who craved verifiable knowledge about mind in the same
 way they craved it about physical events, and who might reasonably curse
 their elder scientific brethren for buying easier success in their own
 enterprise by throwing extra handicaps in the way of their successors in
 social science? Apparently not; mind was to them a convenient receptacle for
 the refuse, the chips and whittlings of science, rather than a possible
 object of scientific knowledge (Burtt, 1932, pp. 318-19).
 
Burtt’s critique is centrally relevant to our attempt to
fathom human nature. He says,
 
But when in the interest of clearing the field for exact
 mathematical analysis, we sweep out of the temporal and spatial realm all
 non-mathematical characteristics, concentrate them in a lobe of the brain,
 and pronounce the semi-real effects of atomic motions outside, they have
 performed a rather radical piece of cosmic surgery which deserves to be
 carefully examined (p. 202).
 
A high price was paid for modern physical explanation:
 
To get ahead confidently with their revolutionary
 achievements, they had to attribute absolute reality and independence to
 those entities in terms of which they were attempting to reduce the world.
 This once done, all the other features of their cosmology followed as
 naturally as you please. It has, no doubt, been worth the metaphysical
 barbarism of a few centuries to possess modern science (p. 303).
 
Having shown how and why they created a mess, Burtt turns to
the consequences for the study of mind: &apos;But when it comes to the question of
replacing this impossible doctrine by a positive theory of mind, there has been
a radical diversity of opinion and a philosophy which will be fair to all the
data and meet all the basic needs clamouring to guide their interpretation is
yet to be invented&apos; (p. 318). He mentions two approaches. The first seeks to
know mind as an object of scientific study according to the canons of scientific
research. It is first necessary to jettison the mind-body dualism and treat what
was formerly considered to be mental as something bodily, i.e., materialist
reductionism. The other alternative is to keep mind special and separate -
loosely equivalent to what we mean by the arts, culture and the humanities.

I have quoted the profound and searching critiques of
Whitehead and Burtt to indicate where we need to look for the metaphysical
foundations of the science-humanities split and the philosophical defensiveness
of the human sciences. At a more technical level, they are challenging what is
known as the doctrine of primary and secondary qualities that divides the world
into extension and figure on the one hand. This is where all the causes lie. On
the other hand are the effects of matter and energy, the secondary qualities,
e.g., colour, odour, taste, smell, i.e., the realm of experience. This division,
along with others generated from it, lies at the heart of the split that
separates the sciences from the humanities. These splits parallel the one
between mind and body and are so basic to our world-view that we seldom, if
ever, examine them:

humanities - science

society - science

morality - science

culture - nature

qualitative - quantitative

value - fact

purpose - mechanism

subject - object

internal - external

secondary- primary (qualities)

thought - extension

mind - body

character - behaviour

human - animal

The reductionist programme of modern science seeks, in the
fullness of time, to reduce the left-hand list to the right hand, since
materialism and evolution attribute causal efficacy to matter, motion and
number. As Isaac Newton once put it, the whole business of natural philosophy is
this: from the phenomena of matter and motion to explain all the other
phenomena. But, as Whitehead, Burtt and a number of others stress again and
again, the split is actually very hard to maintain. It tends to collapse, and
concepts have a way of sneaking across the divide. This is particularly true in
the banishment of goals, purposes, values and what is called teleology or final
causes from scientific explanations. Although they were banished from the new
paradigm, they keep popping up, e.g., in functional explanations and in the
evaluative terms all over the place in evolutionary theory, beginning with its
mechanism, natural selection. How can nature select? We have here an apparently
ineradicable analogy to human (or even divine) intention. Darwin said it was
just a metaphor, and it vexed his supporters, but they could not, as I have
shown in some detail (Young, 197?), wish it away. This has important
implications for the philosophy of science (Young, phil sci) and for the claim,
common in the middle decades of the last century, that physics was the paradigm
science.
 
I suppose that some of you may have found that
philosophical section of my paper hard going. I am not hoping that you will have
grasped it all. I am only illustrating some of the reasons why psychology
students should study the history of ideas in the development of the assumptions
underlying modern science and some of the philosophical critiques of the
scientific mode of explanation. Descartes, Whitehead and Burtt would be set
texts in year one of my proposed curriculum, and certain texts in the philosophy
of mind and perception would come along in the later years, e.g., the writings
of P. F. Strawson (19xx) and of Donald Davidson (19xx).
 
But I would not confine myself to experimental
psychology and its philosophical context -- far from it. I would introduce whole
new strands, ones which I suggest are central to our understanding of human
nature, biography, for instance. I mean by this, of course, biographies of great
scientists, especially Darwin, Freud, William James, J. B. Watson, B. F.
Skinner, Alfred Kinsey, Alan Turing, Norbert Wiener, James Watson and Francis
Crick, Frederick Taylor, the founder of scientific management, who brought
behavioural control to the factory and whose followers brought it to the fast
food restaurant. The next generation brought a softer form of behavioural
control as a result of that was known as The Hawthorn Experiments, and the
biographer of their main researcher, Elton Mayo, would be high on my list.

I would also include biographies of whomsoever, the criterion
being their insight into the human heart. Each of us will have his or her own
candidates for this list. Mine would include The Autobiography of Malcolm X, specified
biographies of Marx, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Henry James, Virginia Wolfe,
Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemmingway, Elvis Presley, Nelson Mandela, Robert
Moses (the main architect of modern New York), Lyndon B. Johnson (the most
deeply studied and psychologically complex statesman of our era), Orson Welles
(cinema’s greatest genius). I won’t extend this list, since, as I said, each
will have his or her own favoured studies. By the way, this list and others I
will offer may well be too long. I bow to experienced constructors of curricula
who know what can be expected of a serious undergraduate.

The subjects of biography and autobiography as genres also
have a fine literature, and some of this would also find a place in my syllabus.
Please don’t think I am merely leavening the scientific curriculum. I commend
to you a paper I wrote some time ago, one of several studies I have done on the
genre. It is entitled‘Biography: The Basic Discipline for a Human Science’and concluded,
 
With biography we link ideas, like a reclining Gulliver,
 to the ground of place and time. We link them by a thousand threads - they
 are all threads of historicity. The more influences represented in a
 hagiographic biography, the less genius. I want to say that more
 articulations mean more social embedding and more ways of holding the
 Gulliver of human arrogance by Lilliputian ties (Young, 19xx, p. xx).
 
That essay also contains some other nominations of
biographies that shed light on human nature on the hoof. I have two purposes in
making a big place for biographies. They can illuminate the histories and labour
processes in the human sciences while at the same time they can provide insights
into the workings of the human mind and heart in context of societies and
institutions.

I turn next to literature. Once we remove the straightjacket
from the curriculum as we now find it and widen our brief to the sources of our
most treasured insights into human nature, who could fail to include Sophocles,
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, George Eliot on idealism, Kafka on guilt and paranoia,
Dostoyevsky on Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov ;
Tolstoy on War and Peace ; Arthur Koestler on totalitarian brainwashing
(19xx). My list would include‘King Lear’’, Hamlet’,‘Othello’,‘Richard
III’- where better to fathom the psychodynamics of ambition, familial
relations, greed, spite, jealousy? I’d include Victor Hugo’s Les
Miserables , the classic text on reparative guilt and The Regeneration
Trilogy , Pat Barker’s deep exploration of the psychological traumas of
war. I am not a student of poetry, but it should have its place.
 
I trust that you have noticed that, as promised, in
designing my ideal curriculum, I have moved boldly among academic disciplines,
drawing mostly on history, philosophy, science and literature but including
anything that I believe illuminates human nature. I say again that most people,
including most psychologists when they are not fighting their academic corner
for time in the curriculum for their very particular sub-discipline, believe
that literature, philosophy and other cultural forms have at least as much to
tell us about human nature and the human condition as does experimental
research.
 
I am from time to time asked to give advice about
where a young person interested in studying psychology should go to university,
and the question is usually followed by a plea to be told of places where the
curriculum is not largely or exclusively positivistic and experimental. They
want something broader and deeper, something recognizably about people in the
world as they experience it. In asking this they contravene two important
principles, one of the embodied in the title of a book by Lewis Wolpert, The
Unnatural Nature of Science , in which he argues that science leads away from
commonsense to things which at first seem unnatural. On this argument, my
enquiring young person looking for a sympathetic course can be said to be
misguided. He or she should accept what is on offer, because it will be good for
them. The second principle is closely related to the first. It is that science
can only advance where its methods and assumptions allow, so one cannot just ask
for studies of human nature as we experience it in our everyday lives. We have
to humble ourselves before the experimental methods and quantitative techniques
of natural science.

You will recall my expositions of Whitehead and Burtt, who
argued that the reductionist programme of modern science is excellent for
certain purposes, in particular, the study of physics and chemistry, but that it
is not suited to the study of human nature, what is loosely called mind,
personality and character. Psychology makes a small gesture to these topics in
some settings. There is even a chair of Qualitative Psychology at Leeds, a
recent incumbent of which, Professor Wendy Hollway, is now head of department at
the Open University. She is fighting an uphill battle in favour of rigorous but
qualitative methods in research. She claims in a recent talk that‘Scientific
psychology has disavowed the central place of meaning and experience in
understanding human behaviour’. I have discussed these matters with her and
some other professors and have asked them where there are departments where a
significantly broader curriculum is on offer. Their immediate response was to be
stumped. The only two I have so far discovered are at the University of East
London and Birkbeck College, London, both of which offer programmes in
Psychosocial Studies.

What about the rest? There are over 120 universities in this
country. Their psychology curricula are, I am reliably told, confined within in
a straightjacket maintained by the British Psychological Society which can give
or withhold the GBR, the Graduate Basis for Registration, which is the kite mark
that determines whether or not graduates from a given university psychology
department are eligible for graduate studies leading to membership in the BPS.
That is, they are the gatekeepers controlling access to the foot of the ladder
which one ascends to gain registration as a professional psychologist. They say
that psychology is an experimental and quantitative science and that research
methods and statistics are central to an undergraduate psychology curriculum.
And, of course, psychology departments are overwhelmingly staffed by people who
have been educated and have done their doctoral research in this climate. If
they weren’t so inclined at the beginning, the process of socialization into
the subculture of experimental psychology as it is now constituted will very
likely and with a few exceptions have led them to take the party line to their
hearts, believing that this is the only scientific way forward. It is, as they
might say, a matter of principle, of integrity.

Just at the moment these sincerely held principles join up
with the fashions of the times to give us passionate dedication to cognitive
science and evolutionary psychology. As you have heard, I am involved in a new
journal in evolutionary psychology. Indeed, as I also mentioned, I have devoted
a lot of my scholarly career to research on Darwinism, broadly conceived. I do
not want to deny the achievements or promise of either of these trends. However,
I do want to advocate pluralism inside psychology and a broadening of its brief
to include other sources of enlightenment about human nature and a moratorium on
calling these other sources of insight mere intuition or folk wisdom. They
include the best of human observation and thought about humanity.
 
Returning to the regulatory climate of the discipline.
I suggest that for all the sincerity of its adherents, it is positivistic in the
pejorative sense of that word, and sclerotic. You don’t have to take my
undoubtedly biased word for this. A former President of the BPS and also chief
honcho of its accrediting squad, Professor Tony Gale, wrote an article on this
very matter in the July 2002 issue of the main organ of the BPS, The
Psychologist . His article is entitled’A Stranglehold on the Development
of Psychology?’Professor Gale is that rare breed, a gamekeeper turned
poacher. His answer to his own question is an emphatic yes. He advocates, purely
and simply, no regulation at the undergraduate level , since the gate
keeping can be done as rigorously as you like at the graduate level. He writes,
 
…critics of the typical psychology curriculum have
 accused it of being over-academic, unquestioningly positivistic, eurocentric,
 phallocentric, ageist, about observing and not listening, and detached from
 everyday experience (Gale, 2002, p. 358).
 
He concludes,
 
If undergraduate accreditation were to end we could
 release psychology departments from the GBR straightjacket and allow
 teachers to determine the curriculum, enabling them also to implement an
 educational programme that best exploited the intrinsic interests of
 students. The discipline could be creative: it could experiment, explore,
 flourish (ibid.)
 
This emancipation could allow undergraduates to have as broad
a curriculum as you like, for example, mine, or something a lot like mine or
even a little bit like it. Part of his point and mine is that there should be
different offerings at different universities: let a hundred - or 123 - flowers
bloom.

Mine is long on some things and short on others, e.g., the
psychology of women. There is a burgeoning and fiercely critical literature in
this field. I am thinking, for example, of Naomi Weisstein’s pioneering essay,‘Psychology Constructs the Female’(1968; Lemisch and Weisstein, 1997;‘Feminist
Psychology…’, 2001), and a recent book, What Do Women Want? Another
might stress ethnic differences, including black psychology or Roland Littlewood’s Aliens and Alienists: Minorities and Psychiatry . For example, an American
analyst, Alan Roland, has written a lovely study of the differences between the
inner lives of people in the East: In Search of Self in India and Japan .
At Sheffield there is a Centre for the Study of Violence. There is an flowering
of writings on Literature and Psychology. The same can be said of the psychology
of racism, of sexual abuse, of gender identity, of groups and institutions. The
list is long, e.g., space psychology, psychology of infants and of the elderly.
Remove the current straightjacket and enterprising university lecturers could
develop a new course from time to time, thereby keeping their minds lively and
exploratory. I can well remember when I was a graduate student in Cambridge that
one of the venerable lecturers was at a loss for words on occasion due to
missing bits in notes that were fraying from repeated annual use. Let’s keep
things fresh and lively.
 
Let us have illuminating documents about the stages on
life’s way from the cradle to the grave. Melanie Klein and Judy Dunn on
infancy, Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn and J. D. Salinger’s The
Catcher in the Rye on adolescence; F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender Is the
Night on young marriage; East of Eden and the film‘Rebel Without a
Cause’on father-son relations (I leave it to you to reflect on the potential
role of films in your curriculum); Little Women on young girls; Philip
Roth on middle age; Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, on family
dynamics and senescence; Lael Wertenbaker’s The Death of a Man on
dying. Once again, I hold no passionate brief for this list or its Yankee bias:
make your own. Have a look at the list of 54 divisions listed at the web site of
the American Psychological Association, and you’ll get a good idea of the
scope of the discipline when it is broadly conceived.

Going further, if we can cast our net as widely as possible,
let’s stretch it to include the domain of religion. I want to say something
about its place of in my ideal curriculum. Some of you will say that now I go
too far. Richard Dawkins, guru of many evolutionary psychologists holds that
religion is reactionary, anti-rational and therefore antiscientific, and, of
course, some of it is. If you don’t want to take this course (it’s an
elective), give it a miss. I’d argue that understanding the psychology of
fundamentalism is a deeply serious current priority, and there are excellent
accessible texts on that topic, on the origins of the idea of Satan and related
matters. Moreover, religion is the longest established cultural form for
understanding nature and human nature and in seeking to improve human relations
and our relations with the cosmos. We live in lineage from Judeo-Christian
thought and are called upon to broaden the base of our tolerance of other
theistic world-views. No less an eminent scientist than Robert Hinde, formerly
Royal Society Professor of Animal Behaviour at Cambridge, has recently written
most interestingly on the question Why Gods Persist (Routledge, 1999), as
he has done so this year on Why Good Is Good: The Sources of Morality (Routledge, 2002). My reading list in this area also includes the writings of
mile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud and Max Weber on religion, but it also includes
certain writings in religion. An example of the potential fruits in his
area is a proposal I once had from an Indian psychologist to write a book on
personality theory based on the pantheon of Hindu gods. Her thesis is that they
covered the aspects of human character pretty thoroughly. Analogous claims could
be made for he Greek and Roman pantheons. I could elaborate on what I hope to
illuminate about human nature from reading certain theologians and certain
sacred texts, e.g., The Bhagavad-Gita , St. Augustine, Kierkegaard,
Buddhism, The Bible , The Koran and The Torah. The writings
of Karen Armstrong offer sure-footed guides on the history of concepts of God.

I have left it to near the end to speak about scientific
classics. Once again, to each his or her own. My reading list includes Darwin’s
Origin of Species and The Descent of Man ; Durkheim’s Suicide; Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams and Civilization and Its
Discontents ; Wilfred Trotter’s Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War ;
L. J. Henderson on The Fitness of the Environment ; Walter Cannon on
homeostasis; Wilfred Bion’s Experiences in Groups ; Kai Erikson’s Wayward
Puritans (on how you deal with delinquency in a supposedly utterly devout
community); Elie Cohen’s Human Behavior in the Concentration Camp ;
Stanley Milgram’s Obedience to Authority; Kurt Danziger’s Constructing
the Subject: Historical Origins of Psychological Research; Berger and
Luckmann’s The Social Construction of Reality ; Nicholas Lemann’s The
Big Test (a searching and critical history of the Princeton Educational
Testing Service, a topic of contemporary interest if there ever was one) This
portion of the programme would include certain classics in Psychology, Social
Psychology, Anthropology and Sociology, the precise list to be determined by
horse trading in the curriculum committee. It would also include collections of
key and classical papers from the journal literature.

I would also add certain classics in the history of ideas,
beginning with Arthur O. Lovejoy’ s The Great Chain of Being , the
founding document in that scholarly tradition. Karl Mannheim’s Ideology and
Utopia is the founding document in the sociology of knowledge. As usual,
others would add their own classics to this list.

My last category is history itself, giving a broad view of
certain key episodes on human relations. I am thinking of James Walvin’s Black
Ivory: The History of British Slavery ; Richard Watt’s account of the
failure to bring democracy to Europe at the end of the First World War, The
Kings Depart ; Martin Gilbert’s narrative history of The Holocaust ,
Harrison Salisbury’s account of the German siege of Leningrad, 900 Days. 
 
I suppose you are beginning to feel that my remarks
degenerated some minutes ago into the recitation of an annotated reading list. I
am sorry if it seems so. My aim has been to be catalytic and a bit provocative,
using my exemplars in the hope of evoking yours. When I spoke at the Cambridge
Psychology Department about broadening the curriculum there, the first
respondent said that’s all very well, but not one of us would willing give a
second of timetable slot to anything other than what we already have and fought
for the right to teach. It would be dishonest to pretend that all the course
slots for perception, cognitive and evolutionary psychology and brain and
behaviour research could stand just as they are while my domains - or some of
them - were added. Every university will synthesize its own mixture of elements
with varying emphases. My only answer to the inevitable conservatism of
defending the course list as it now sands, beyond the appeal of what I have
sketched, is to try to scare you into broadening your horizons. If Professor
Gale has his way you will have to look to your laurels as other universities
broaden their curricula and woo potential applicants away from your course.

I know a bit about such things. When I offered a Special
Subject in the History Tripos at Cambridge on the debate about‘Man’s Place
in Nature’in Nineteenth-Century Britain - a broad version of the
controversies surrounding Darwin - old lags who were accustomed to offering
topics like the Popes from 1202 till 1215 - smiled patronisingly and said my
special subject would be a soft option and none of the better students would
take it. Not only did they flock to it, but they also got disproportionately
high exam results in my and their other papers, and a number, including the
distinguished historian Roy Porter, alas recently deceased, took up research in
the area I had taught. Broad issues can be studied deeply and meticulously
researched, I promise you.
 
My last nomination is a book that exemplifies
practically everything for which I am arguing. It is part history, part
exposition, part conceptual critique, part ideological analysis, part
institutional history, part analysis of science fiction and of popular culture
and all excellent. I am referring to Donna Haraway’s history of the biological
and behavioural discipline of primatology, entitled Primate Visions: Gender,
Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science , chosen in a recent poll as
one of the best one hundred books published in the twentieth century. Her choice
of topic is of considerable interest in placing us in the animal kingdom.
Primatology is the discipline in which we create a pedigree for the concept of
humanity.

I have written at length about the book’s strengths in an
essay entitled‘Science, Ideology and Donna Haraway’. Her next book, a
collection of essays called Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of
Natur e, which I published, received an American Book Award. I commend her
work to you and your students. She does not stop at disciplinary boundaries. She
gathers up truth and enlightenment wherever she can find it. She has been given
innumerable awards, prizes and honorary presentations and continues to write
prolifically. You can find her publications at various web sites beginning with
her own at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
 
One last point, which I offer as a taster. If you
asked me what course I’d like to teach, it’s entitled’Concepts of Human
Nature and the Self’. I would present the debates on the concept of human
nature, one that has been fiercely attacked and defended. The same is true of
the concept of the self. Marxists, deconstructionists and post-modernists have
argued that human nature and the self are ideological categories and that they
are only hooks on which to hang determinations or to inscribe the influences of
socialization. Other Marxists (e.g., Norman Geras and Sean Sayers) stoutly
defend these concepts, as do many philosophers and psychologists, e.g., Stephen
Pinker in his latest book, The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human
Nature. There are also useful monographs on the concept of the self, e.g.,
by Jerome Levin and Anthony Elliott.
 
These are large topics. To give you an idea, the entry
on human nature in the Dictionary of the History of Ideas occupies a
whole page and extends from Achilles, Aeschylus, Agamemnon and Alcmaeon, the
last of whom founded anatomy, to Xenophanes, Xenophon and Zeus, the last of whom
created the world. The three founding figures of the empiricist tradition have
it in the titles of major treatises: Humane Nature: Or the Fundamental
Elements of Policie (1650) by Thomas Hobbes, An Essay Concerning Human
Nature (1690) by John Locke, and A Treatise of Human Nature (1738) by
David Hume. All were concerned to deny the existence of innate ideas in human
nature. Hence, the problem of what is given and what is experienced lies at the
foundations of our question. Leftists used to minimize what is given, but in
recent years behavioural geneticists have found evidence for genes for some of
the traits the left was keenest to deny the existence of. I am thinking of
Robert Plomin’s work at the Maudsley in London on the genetics of general
cognitive ability. Thus, Human nature poses perennial questions. Without making
a special effort, I recalled more than a dozen books on my shelves with human
nature in the title. Amazon lists 2608.

The phrase‘human nature’is, once you reflect on it for
a moment, more problematic than helpful. Does it imply that humanity is wholly
natural? In some sense it must be, since, as I’ve said before, we evolved as
biological organisms by means of natural selection. But does the modifier mean
that human nature is somehow not reducible to natural processes? And our
troubles begin. That is, all versions of determinism and reductionism have
wanted it both ways: to assert that humans (biologically: our species) are
wholly natural but then to find it problematic, since our concept of nature is
impoverished with respect to the matters which we most value about our humanity,
emotions, for instance. Passion lurked somewhere in between the poles of the
Cartesian ontological mind-body dualism. It is a topic that cognitive psychology
was, at least in its early days, skittish about taking up. An early historian of
the movement wrote,
 
Though mainstream cognitive scientists do not necessarily
 bear any animus against the affective realm, against the context that
 surrounds any action or thought, or against historical or cultural analyses,
 in practice they attempt to factor out these elements to the maximum extent
 possible... And so, at least provisionally, most cognitive scientists
 attempt to so define and investigate problems that an adequate account can
 be given without resorting to these murky concepts (Gardner, 1985, pp.
 41-42).
 
This situation began to change about ten or fifteen years
ago, soon after those words were written, as new journals such as Cognition
and Emotion started to appear. Research on the emotions is now popular, due
to the work of people like Paul Ekman, Joseph LeDoux, and Antonio Damasio, all
three of whom seem ubiquitous in the media lately. Damasio’s recent books, Descartes’Error and The Feeling of What Happens, both have Emotion in
their subtitles. Needless to say, given my own professional work, I would argue
that psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theory and clinical work have a lot to
offer in the domain of the vicissitudes of emotional life.

I’ll stop here - deliberately in mid-flo. I hope you begin
to see the sorts of issues that would be explored in my proposed course on the
concepts of human nature and of the self. This taster is also an exemplar of the
sorts of things I am advocating in a much-broadened curriculum in psychology.
 
In conclusion, there is a lot of dumbing down going on in culture and
academia. There are, even so, a few remaining voices insisting on the complexity
and depth of serious academic work or politics or culture. When I was Graduate
Tutor at King’s College Cambridge, one of the most erudite and thoughtful
students I encountered in over a decade of working with some of the best
graduate students from all over the world had attended a course at St. Johns
College in Annapolis, Maryland. The curriculum there consisted almost
exclusively of great books chosen from the whole sweep of history. Even though
he had undergone this wide curriculum, he was accepted by Cambridge to do
graduate work in chemistry and did imaginative, excellent and highly original
research and got his doctorate. The list of books the students at St. Johns read
is on the web at http://www.sjca.edu/college/readlist.phtml 

It’s a four-year programme, and its scope is, of course,
much wider than psychology or human nature, but I am left feeling that, by
analogy, reading and pondering my list may not be too much to ask. See what you
think.

As Kevin Costner was so memorably told in‘Field of Dreams’,‘If you build it they will come’. I rest my case.
