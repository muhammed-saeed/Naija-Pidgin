 ★★★★★ bad service 
 Janice M. 5 Hardee&apos;s 
 
The service was not good. We entered the fast-food restaurant between 4:45&amp;5:00 pm. We ordered coffee and was told that they had already washed the pot, and since they closed at 10:00 pm, they could not make any more. We thought this was strange as we were the only ones ordering and there were only about two more small groups of customers in the place. We did place our order, and continued on to the counter with the condiments before going to our seat. We were only able to pump out one cup of ketchup and then the container was empty. When we told the same lady at the order counter, she said that they had been too busy to fill the ketchup container. (They did fill it after we went to our seats). However, they had plenty of time to talk about a party happening later. The food was not bad, but we thought the employee at the cash register could certainly use a little training in dealing with customers. We heard the booth next to ours comment on the coffee also - I mean, really, they only had 5 hours left before closing. They were either too lazy or they need an easier coffee pot as this one is much too complicated for them.
