Sizing Up for a Fast Food Restaurant

 By Jens Peter Jensen 
 
All About the Fast Food Restaurant

Fast food restaurants are basically those kinds of restaurants that are known for their fast, up front service, as well as the food they serve. As per the food, well, the menu is usually the same in almost every fast food joints here is in the planet, namely: fried chicken, burgers, French fries, and cola or soda. The bigger, more popular food places often branch out or engage in the business of franchising. Examples of the bigger and more popular restaurants include McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy&apos;s.

The Average Size of a Fast food Restaurant

So now, here is the question: just what is the average size of a fast food restaurant? To answer this question, first off, we would need to know just how much is the approximate needed space for bus boys and other staff to be able to work comfortably as well as for tables, chairs, and customers to be able to be placed and moved around in the most efficient manner. For some food industry leaders, a fast food restaurant that is approximately the size of a small condo unit or about the size of a studio room should be enough for starters in the business. This will take an estimate total restaurant size or land area of 600 square feet.

However, this size would only be enough for the dining area. For the kitchen area, where all the preparations would take place, there needs to be perhaps about the same amount of space that is allotted for the dining area for all the equipment to fit in as well as for all the stocks to be able to have ample space in it.

And then, there would also be the space allotted for the toilets, and, possibly, a play area for the kids, if the food joint is intended to target families with little kids, or if it should be a family themed restaurant. Of course, this is purely optional, but it would really help up the profits if there are extra attractions in the restaurant.

Now, if in case the restaurant owner would really want to have toilets and play areas in his fast food restaurant, then a space of about 100 to 300 square feet for each should be enough. All in all, the size or the dimensions that should be allotted for a regular restaurant would be about 1,500 square feet.
