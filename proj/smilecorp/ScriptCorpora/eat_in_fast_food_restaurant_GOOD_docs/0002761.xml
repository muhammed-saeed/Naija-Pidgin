Now that I&apos;m grown up and my mother has died, I have taken the opportunity to teach my kids how to play. This game is incredibly fun, and Hasbro made extra sure that players would be delighted by this games new features. There&apos;s a wheel that conveniently holds property for you, wooden houses and hotels, a restructured bank, and a brand new look and feel to the board game. There&apos;s no other game on the market that will teach you so many things about business and money counting and conservation. This will be extremely helpful when your kids work at a fast food restaurant.In my mind, this is the best version to buy if you have enough money left after paying your third mortgage on your trailer home. One downside, however, is that the money is easily ripped and bent. I find this to happen most often when your brother in law comes over and you start to quarrel. Overall, kudos to Hasbro! 23 of 25 people found the following review helpful Even better! 13 July 1999 By A Customer - Published on Amazon.com Durability:    Educational:    Fun:    I started collecting different editions of Monopoly (and copycat games) when I was a little kid. This is how I began learning about money... and how expensive rent really is... I received this game as a gift, and prefer this edition over the others. With twice as much paper money, it&apos;s a heck of a lot more fun to be the banker. There&apos;s a nifty stand for the Title Deeds... and the wooden houses/hotels don&apos;t need to be straightened out every time someone throws the dice, either. 33 of 38 people found the following review helpful The deluxe version has just about everyting you need! 14 Dec 2005 By D. M Paul - Published on Amazon.com Durability:    Educational:    Fun:    This deluxe version of monopoly is in-cre-di-ble. Sometimes we play it so much that we stop and don&apos;t play it for ages, but after a few months we play it and this deluxe version has made playing it so much easier.

First, the wooden Houses and Hotels. They are a lot more fun to use and much easier to handle. They&apos;re not hollow and look real nice, even if they&apos;re not so detailed as the plastic ones.

Second, the Gold pieces. The pieces are absolutely elegant with their simple designs and their beautiful shiny gold. Not real gold, but it makes them all look incredible! Plus, their&apos;s an extra token. It&apos;s a train token, and I find it one of my favorite tokens now. (The money bag is also included)

Third, the banker&apos;s tray. Some people may not like this if they are too used to taking money out of individual trays, but this keeps the money together much easier. Their is a slot where you insert the money like you would drop an envelope in a drawer, and you can take it out easily. Plus, it has three little compartments for the houses, hotels, and a small one for the tokens and dice. It really is wonderful.

Fourth, the Propert Carousel. If you ever got angry about keeping the properties in order, you don&apos;t need to anymore. It is a small turntable with slots for each property including railroads and utilities. You can spin it around whenever you&apos;re searching for a particular one. It is extremely handy, as you can spin it very easily and it never wears out. (If you take out all the properties and spin the turntable on a smooth surface, it will spin for ages :-) )

Fifth, the Community Chest and Chance cards are not paper. They&apos;re now plastic cards with coloring in their pictures. It looks real shiny and new, and they&apos;re much easier to shuffle and handle.

The board also has a large specially colored Rich Uncle Pennybags in the middle with DELUXE EDITION below him in gold letters. That really gives the whole thing a brand new work. (The money also has DELUXE EDITION on it, so you can tell it apart from the original).

Seven, the other tray for holding things. If you have ever gotten fed up with using rubber bands or plastic bags to hold your pieces and properties and cards, this will make your life ten times easier. It has a spot for holding everything together leaving no room for scattering unless you turned the box upside-down. It has a progressively larger compartement (from the bottom up) sunk into the tray, leaving spaces for the Community Chest and Chance cards first. Then the Title Deed cards, then the property carousel, and tow big slots beside that for the money. You can put it all away and take no more than five minutes in the next game to start.

Altogether, not only is this game an enormous improvement to the original (the original was good too :-) ) But it saves you hours of time just putting the game together or putting it away. I found monopoly much more enjoyable when I didn&apos;t need to take so much time to move things around or sort things out. If you love monopoly, then get this. You will really find the gameplay much more enjoyable with fancy pieces and easier sorted out areas for your house, hotels, money, ect. It may cost a lot, but it is worth ever penny. I think I can gaurantee you will not be disappointed. › Go to Amazon.com to see all 51 reviews Were these reviews helpful?  Let us know
