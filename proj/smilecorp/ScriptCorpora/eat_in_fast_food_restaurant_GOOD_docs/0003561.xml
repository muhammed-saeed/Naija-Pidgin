Care to downsize that order? Many want smaller portions
 
Care to downsize that cheeseburger order?
 By Linda Carroll 
What if the server at your favorite fast food joint asked if you wanted to downsize your order, instead of asking you to supersize it?

That’s a strategy that might make some patrons happier–and a lot thinner, a new study suggests.

When people were asked if they wanted to downsize portions of their side dishes at a fast food restaurant, as many as a third opted for the smaller–and thus lower calorie - option, according to the report published in the journal Health Affairs.

The whole notion seems counter to our natural bargain-hunting instincts: less food for the same price. But consumers apparently are ready to tighten their belts, literally.
 Advertise | AdChoices 
“The restaurant thought people wouldn’t be willing to do it,&quot; said the study’s lead author, Janet Schwartz, a psychologist and an assistant professor of marketing at the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University.“Some people don’t want big supersized portions and they’re willing to pay a premium for it by paying the same amount for less food.”

Other strategies, like displaying the calorie count of every item on the fast food restaurant menu, just haven’t led to weight loss, Schwartz said.

The idea behind downsizing is that people really do understand that no matter what’s put on their plates, they’ll most likely devour every single morsel, Schwartz said. But, if they’re given a chance to get a smaller portion before they stick the first forkful into their mouths, many will go for it.

For the new study, Schwartz and her colleagues asked a fast food Chinese restaurant to offer customers smaller portions of high carb side dishes. In one experiment, people were given a small price incentive - a 25-cent savings–and in two others, they were simply offered a smaller portion at the same price.

When there was a cash discount, 33 percent of people chose the smaller portions, as compared to 21 percent and 18 percent without the monetary incentive. 

The savings in calories were significant–200 for those choosing the downsized option.

Leslie Bonci, a nutritionist at the University of Pittsburgh thinks this kind of strategy could help the nation shed some serious pounds.

Certainly the addition of calorie counts didn’t.

“There’s a certain number numbness out there,”said Bonci, director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

A big part of the problem is the growth of the portion size, Bonci said. It’s changed our expectations.

“There was a time when the piece of meat on our plate would be 6 ounces,”Bonci explained.“Now, depending on where you go, it can be anywhere from 9 to 12 ounces–and more if you get a steak. A serving of pasta used to be a cup, now it’s 3 at a minimum and often up to 6.

“Meanwhile, vegetables have taken a nose-dive. You used to get five chunks of broccoli on your plate, now it’s just one sad little spear. There’s been a total reversal of what’s being put on our plates and our eyes have gotten used to it.”

Still, Bonci said, calling it“downsizing,”might not be the best strategy if you want it to appeal to hungry diners.“Downsizing has such a negative connotation,”she explained.“People are going to think,‘I don’t want to lose my food!”

“Instead of asking,‘would you like to add some fries,’servers could ask,‘would you like to right-size it,’”Bonci suggested.

If you’re trying to figure out how to implement the“right-size”strategy at your favorite fast food joint, Bonci suggests simply ordering the smallest size of everything–and not ordering anything bigger than the size of your fist.

“So, if you do a single burger or a junior burger and a small fries then you’re really getting out of there unscathed in terms of your calorie cap,”Bonci said.“And make sure you choose a small drink, too. Or better yet, ask for a cup with ice and fill it with water.”

Bonci underscores the importance of carefully monitoring your liguid calories.“If you order a small burger and a small fries and add to that a tank sized soda you can triple the calories of your meal,”she said.

If you’re going to allow yourself a desert, like ice cream, ask for the kiddie cone, Bonci suggests.

In regular restaurants consider ordering appetizers instead of the full entre, or asking if they offer a half size portion, Bonci suggests.

Restaurants are the worst wanting to keep prices high and the same no matter what is ordered. I always order appetizers or soup; pretty soon they will become wise to that.

They need to make a certain profit on each plate, so they add more food (which is only a small part of what it costs to run the restaurant) to make people think the meal is a good value.

But I hate eating out and always having food left over. It either goes to waste or I have to deal with the hassle of carting it home, refrigerating it, reheating it, and throwing away the packaging.

I would rather buy human-sized meals I can finish in the restaurant without exploding, even if the price per ounce is higher.

I wouldn&apos;t mind so much but many places have a no sharing rule where you can&apos;t ask for an additional plate if you order just one entree.

I have to tell them I am a visiting dignitary that decided to try AppleBee&apos;s and this is my royal food taster - now be so kind as to get me another plate before you start an international incident!

My husband and I go out every Friday night and split an order -- share a burger and fries, or split a fish dinner (he&apos;ll eat the potatoes and roll and I get the coleslaw), etc. Works fine and we aren&apos;t stuffed.

I&apos;d rather restaurants offer lower calorie versions of their food than just eat less of the fatty and sugary stuff. You can save hundreds of calories by using fat free mayo (or fat free Miracle Whip, my favorite), low fat or nonfat cheese, nonfat milk, sugar free beverages, and Splenda-sweetened lowfat desserts. Then kick up the healthy factor by putting more lettuce and tomato on your burger and skip the fries.

Yes, most fast food places do offer diet sodas, but there&apos;s often only one choice, such as Diet Coke (yummy). Maybe more people would order sugar free drinks if they also came in Diet Orange, Diet 7-Up, and so on. I just don&apos;t understand why anyone who&apos;s interested in their health would ever order a sugary soda and a big scoop of fries, which seems to be a favorite of young adults and teens.

Large portions don&apos;t bother me because I usually take home half of my food as leftovers to eat the next day. That makes eating out less expensive and is more convenient than cooking daily. Or like the poster above, two of us (or more) will order fewer items and then share.

Ordering appetizers instead of an entree isn&apos;t smart because most apps are higher in fat and calories than main dishes and rarely include a serving of fruit or vegetables. Salads with low calorie dressing (no cheese, no bacon) and broth-based soups are better choices if you don&apos;t want to order an entree. Besides, restaurants usually make higher profits on their appetizers, desserts, and beverages, so an entree may be the better bargain.

First of all Splenda is terrible for the body, and the body doesn&apos;t know how to digest fat free dairy. Fat helps the body feel more full and people end up eating twice as much of nonfat things than stuff with fat, and usually fat free options only end up cutting 1/3 the calories from their full fat cousins. Seriously, skip the low fat stuff. I lost 60 pounds by adding full fat dairy into my diet. I did not change my calorie intake at all.

The problem is a small soda these days is 16-20 ounces. I can remember when a small soda was only 8-12 ounces. That is where you really pile on the calories, drinking all that sugar water soda. Most people are loathe to let food go to waste and will force themselves to finish what is put in front of them. Portion growth at restaurants has led to waistline growth for the American public.

Vic,

Research is showing more and more that it isn&apos;t just that simple. There are several mechanisms that keep people from stopping:

1.) It&apos;s here, I might as well eat it. People eat all the food that they see, and feel full no matter what size the portion was. It&apos;s an interesting show in mental gymnastics, but it&apos;s been shown very conclusively. It probably has a little to do with the desire to not waste food, which was drilled into many of us as kids.

2.) The &quot;never know where the next meal is coming from&quot; instinct. Even as civilized as we are, our lower brainstem still thinks we&apos;re a lizard, and it constantly doubts that there will be food available in the future. Ever notice how your dog eats like the world is going to end?

3.) Impulse control. The urge to eat more is an impulse, and some people are just programmed to be bad at controlling their impulses. This can lead to overeating or eating too much of the &quot;bad&quot; food and not enough of the &quot;good.&quot; Especially when paired with stress, and America is one of the most overstressed, overworked first world nations.

And yet if people could just control themselves there would be no problems. It&apos;s always the people that can control themselves that suffer, as followers let the world decide for them.

I fully agree with you, Mockingbird. My daughter and I went to a movie recently, and the &quot;small&quot; popcorn used to be considered the large size. I asked if that was the small and they assured me it was and then showed me the large and bucket sizes. Could have easily fed 6 to 8 people. Totally ridiculous. Literally, you couldn&apos;t tell my daughter had eaten any of the popcorn because not only was it a huge bag, but it was also overflowing when she got it.

When dining out, I always order an appetizer as my entree, and there may be times when I order either a dinner salad, or a small soup to go along with the entree. I&apos;m not cheap, I just don&apos;t eat that much at one sitting. I&apos;m always full with just that.

When my daughter in law and I go out, we always split an entree, and then each order a dinner salad or soup. It comes out just fine. Whenever I do order a complete entree for myself, I always end up taking half of it home which is great, because I get another whole meal out of the deal.

I usually go for the &apos;junior&apos; sized burgers and fries (no soda, I have water or tea at home or work). It&apos;s cheaper, healthier, and I can then occasionally splurge and get a &apos;junior&apos; sized shake!

Some of us were brought up to appreciate that we HAD food, and to eat what we had on our plate. I often don&apos;t, and if I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll eat it later I get box. But very often I end up just leaving it for them to throw away - which is very wasteful.

When I go to a restaurant if I order an app then I wind up taking the entree home. When I skip the app and just get the entree then I will eat part of it and take the other part home for the next day. Get an extra meal for the price of one. Don&apos;t go to fast food but once a month. Too many calories, sugar, and salt. Doesn&apos;t cost much more to eat at restaurant.

It&apos;s not a matter of being weak-willed - it&apos;s a matter of not wanting an obscene amount of food. I either split entrees with a friend, or take it home for two (or three) more meals. As for thinking of starving people in other parts of the world, I do that - which is why I give to charities that help to feed them and don&apos;t want to be overfed myself!

I appreciate every ones comments...but did anybody ever think that making the food tastier would be a good idea. I know when I am at a good restaurant and the food is fresh an well prepared I eat less.

Most places inundate their food with to much salt, soda has who knows what in it, and butter on popcorn don&apos;t make me laugh!

I sometimes think we guzzle stuff down in hopes that we will taste something beyond the chemicals.

Quitting soda is probably not only the easiest but healthiest option you have if you want to lose weight. If you miss your bubbles just get some mineral water or soda water. If you absolutely need it sweet, add in a small amount of juice.

Drinking soda is like pounding down a bag of sugar.

We simply do not need to be eating so much or drinking so much soda. I stopped drinking soda (use to drink one 12 oz can a day on average) or eating at any fast food restaurant (went an average of 2-3 times a week) for about seven weeks now. My only splurge during this time was two slices of pizza. I did not do ANY exercise during these seven weeks but several people around me commented that my stomach got smaller. And I certainly feel better. So yeah, what you eat makes a huge difference! I have also started to gradually cut down on my portion size. And yes, I sometimes do get hungry a few hours later but instead of junk food, I would have fruit. I also make sure that I drink plenty of WATER every day. Like I said, I feel much better after making these small changes. I can not even imagine how much weight I will lose once I start doing some moderate exercise such as brisk walking for 30-45 minutes 3 or 4 times a week.

You can order things without the sauce as well. Outback has a lovely 6 oz pork tenderloin that you get without the sugary, greasy sauce, plus a baked sweet potato with plain butter (on the side) and steamed veg. To me it&apos;s the perfect meal: meat and potatoes. No frills and reasonable potions. Then a nice craft beer for dessert... after the meal so my good judgement is still intact when I order and eat.

In a &quot;perfect meal,&quot; half of your dinner would consist of vegetables (not the starchy ones) or salad, plus perhaps some unsweetened fruit. No butter, no beer.... Have water, coffee or tea to drink - minus sugar.

While sweet potatoes do contain more nutrients than a regular baked potato, they&apos;re still considered a starch rather than a true vegetable. And eating a serving of baked sweet potato is just half of a small-to-medium sized potato, not the whole thing.

NO fries #1 rule, get small salad and small burger. Half or less calories than big buger with fries. Also no mayo on burger 50-100 cal right there if they put it on heavy. Don&apos;t drown salad with dressing, use very small amt, tsp if mixed completely flavors the salad w/o the calories. Yes , water no cal, plus its free in most areas. Save couple bucks and 300 calories to boot.

How about making portion sizes smaller and charging less? Doesn&apos;t that make more sense?

Unfortunately, smaller portions generally equal higher prices under the guise of &quot;healthy fare&quot;. It is hard to pay $2-$5 more for half the food. How about half the food for half the price?

I know of 2 restaurants that offer 1/2 size portions. One charges 1/2 price plus 0.50 and the other half price plus $1.00. Chances are fairly good, that I won&apos;t entirely finish the half portion. I&apos;d rather go twice as often than bring home something that is not as appealing when warmed in the microwave the next day.

That&apos;s really a great option - wish there was something like that for the restaurants around here. I just find dealing with left-overs a hassle but I don&apos;t want to waste food. This really is a win-win since it saves money but the restaurant still gets a operational profit.

Agree with several others, just eat half of portion, get take-out bag - two meals for the price of one. Or as others say just order appetizer and a salad.

And of course there is the other option, if you don&apos;t like what/how much is served - don&apos;t go there! But then that would mean you are actually making a choice. Are there restaraunts that have employees either outside/inside who force you to eat what they serve(sarcasm)? Don&apos;t think so.

The eat some and take some home is a good idea, if you are going home right away...recently I was on vacation with my sister and we did not have a refridgerator in our motel room so no way to take leftovers home...or if you are eating out while shopping or going somewhere else afterwards, taking leftovers and leaving them in a car for a few hours does not seem the safest idea...I prefer to have the option of smaller portions, and a smaller bill to go along with it.

I like going to a place like Olive Garden - even at dinner time, you can ask for the lunch sized portion on some of the pasta dishes, like (my fave) Cappelini Pomodoro. Since you get the AYCE salad, it&apos;s easy to either take home the smaller entree or at least you won&apos;t over eat.

Sorry, but there&apos;s no way going to Olive Garden is going to be good for your waistline. Not possible. I love the place, but seriously, look at their menu. But, I agree with your strategy if you&apos;re going to go there anyway. Just don&apos;t stuff yourself full of breadsticks. Ha ha. :)

I simply don&apos;t ever order &quot;desert&quot; at the end of my meal. Nor do I indulge in &quot;liguid&quot; calories via soda. I&apos;m 49, 5&apos;8&quot; and weigh 124. Oh, and MSNBC-is your proofer on vacation??

Yes, the proofer is on vacation. How do you order &quot;desert&quot;? I&apos;ll take one Sahara Desert, please. Dessert is what you mean, I think. And drink diet sodas for no added calories.

Don&apos;t kid yourself, diet soda is just as bad for you, if not more so, than regular soda.

This is the US and Americans love to eat. Keep it the American way. I want to see lots of food on my plate. If you want to get less food at restaurants, then move to Canada. They serve you far less for a higher price. I believe that Americans should strive to eat healthier. We should make Fast Food much more healthier; when the food is healthy, consumers will be less addicted.

I&apos;ve got a news flash for you, Francis . HUMAN BEINGS love to eat. It&apos;s not just Americans, so please refrain from shipping everyone out of the country just for wanting smaller portions as an option. A big platter full of fat- and sodium-laden cheap food may be &quot;the American way,&quot; but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s the best way. I think a lot of people just might appreciate a smaller portion, or might opt for quality over quantity.

And here&apos;s another parcel of information for you: it&apos;s just &quot;much healthier,&quot; not &quot;much more healthier.&quot;

I don&apos;t eat at fast food chain restaurants. You never really know what is being used for fillers and the fat, sodium and calorie counts are disgraceful. Like most everyone else I am fed up with paying the price for oversize portions at almost every restaurant. We used to eat out 4-7 times per week. We have stopped eating out because of the tactics used to sell more food. When reasonable portions and prices come back into vogue we&apos;ll start eating out again.

It&apos;s terrible trying to find a decent sized salad. I gave up ordering from Mcdonalds and Taco bell. I love their salads, but they&apos;re just way too big. Wish someone in these companies would get a clue. Even in Restaurants like Applebees, the dinner salad is big enough to be a meal in itself. And they wonder why we no longer patronize their places

Yes, that&apos;s an option, but Kitty &apos;s opinions, if you read the article, are increasingly shared by a great many people, so the logical thing for restaurants to do is to offer smaller portions. Does anyone really need a 2/3-lb. burger with a platter full of giant thick-cut steak fries? I&apos;m not saying to get rid of it, but offer a sensible alternative to the obviously growing number of Americans who would be perfectly content with a meal that&apos;s half the size.

Point of fact: You&apos;ll never find a Wendy&apos;s where their &quot;3/4-lb. triple&quot; sales outpace their &quot;1/4-lb. single&quot; sales. Think about that.

I love salads, but they are calorie minefields. Very few fast food restaurants, unless its Cosi/SaladWorks/Panera, have healthy salads on the menu....and dinner salads are the worst! Honestly, you are usually better off eating something else, like a plain hamburger or chicken sandwich.

Yeah, I want to go out to eat tiny portions.

It&apos;s not restaurant food that makes people fat (unless that&apos;s all you eat, then you need to be fat).
