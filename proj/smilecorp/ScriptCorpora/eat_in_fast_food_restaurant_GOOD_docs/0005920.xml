 Posted: Thu Feb 15, 2007 10:58 am     Post subject: fountain drink dispensers. what level of protection is recommended for fountain drink dispensers?
check valve? stainless steel rpz? any opinions?

a pressurized CO2 tank could create a back pressure situation if the regulator on the tank fails. if i&apos;m not mistaken the regulator keeps the outlet pressure on the tank at 60-100 psi. and the tank itself is between 700-800 psi. if you have copper pipes it sounds like a dangerous situation to me. and what if the supply pressure is only at or around 60 psi?

 Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:39 am     Post subject: Fountain Dispenser Would depend on the local classification of&quot;Degree of Hazard&quot;. In most jurisdictions a soda fountain would be considered only a pollutant, meaning a non-health hazard. If this is the case then a Double Check would suffice. As a general rule of thumb and because of the corrosive affect on metal by CO2, I would recomend stainless or plastic. Hope this helps somewhat.

A stainless steel RPBP would be overkill&amp;impose an unnecessary ongoing backflow testing expense...

 Quote: &quot;The right dispenser valves are key in protecting beverage consumers. ...Whether you drink soda or pop, have you ever thought about the water quality used to make these beverages? ...if it is from a drink dispenser, the water supply is an important part of the equation. ...The problem occurs when carbonic acid, which is highly corrosive to copper and copper alloy found in many drink dispensers, reacts to the metal and creates an excess of copper in the water used to produce soda. When this happens, the person consuming the beverage gets a bad drink. Depending on the amount of copper in the water, you can get a terrible stomachache. There are cases of vomiting, as well as trips to the hospital. While I don&apos;t know of anyone dying, some attacked by copper poisoning said it felt like they were dying. ...Anytime a potable water line supplying a soft drink can be contaminated, there&apos;s concern on the part of the plumbing industry. ...In the late 1980s, ASSE started a project to establish a standard for a new vented double-check valve to protect the water supply to carbonated beverage dispensers. For years, dispenser manufacturers installed a double-check valve on the water supply inside the units. ASSE 1032 regulates these valves. The problem for the plumbing industry is the valves have no atmospheric vent. Hence, if there is a failure, there is a possibility of carbonic acid flowing back to a copper water line. The new standard was designated ASSE 1022. ...The soft drink industry announced last year (1999) it is switching all new carbonated beverage dispensers to an internal ASSE 1022 device for backflow protection. ...What about the older carbonated beverage dispensers? For the older dispensers, you need to provide an external ASSE 1022 backflow preventer. Whenever you are doing any work in a fast food restaurant, quick shop, restaurant, nightclub or other location with a carbonated beverage dispenser, check to make sure the dispenser has the correct backflow preventer. It needs either an internal or external ASSE 1022 device. Now, for a little secret. If you encounter a dispenser with a built-in ASSE 1032 device, which is the wrong one under new plumbing codes, and no external ASSE 1022 device, have the owner of the facility contact his distributor. The distributor, typically a soda company under contract, will replace the ASSE 1032 device with an ASSE 1022 as a part of its service contract with the facility.&quot;

 Posted: Sun Oct 07, 2007 12:16 pm     Post subject: Gerald you are wrong! SS backflow devices are needed. Stainless steel backflow devices and downstream plastic lines are needed!!! When you install a backflow device on a Soda Fountain you are obligated to protect consumers of the water being used downstream as well as upstream. CO2 will also destroy the bronze body seats and basically render it useless. USC states that bronze&quot;RP&quot;bodies can be used only when you can guarantee the psi reading on the carbonation pump does not exceed 175psi and the internal check ball valves on the carbonator pumps are operating properly. What&apos;s the last time a backflow tester checked those as part as their regular inspection. Never. And they never will! So do the right thing and install the SS backflow preventor and plastic lines downstream!!! There is no argument for cost and to use it as an excuss not to do a proper installation is absurd.

Special Summary
Beverage Dispensing Machines
The number of backflow incidents resulting from the backflow of carbon dioxide from beverage dispensing machines are too numerous to include detailed reports of each incident in this publication. However, some detailed reports of noteworthy incidents are included.
The following special summary of backflow incidents involving beverage dispensing machines is provided to illustrate the frequency of occurrence:
1952, Kokomo, Indiana
Extensive corrosion of a copper cylinder in a manufacturing plant was caused by faulty check valve on a carbonated beverage machine. Twelve persons ill.
1957, Fort Hamilton, New York
Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army, indicates faulty check valve on beverage machine results in carbonation in copper water line. Three persons became ill. Reports of carbonation, with no reference to any illness, were also made for First Army Headquarters and a Naval Receiving Station in New York.
1957, Baltimore, Maryland
A four-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of vomiting immediately after consuming a drink from a beverage machine. Laboratory report showed copper salts in gastric washings.
1957, Kansas City, Missouri
A two-year-old girl became ill within 15 minutes of sipping carbonated beverage. Remainder of beverage was taken to laboratory for testing; 35 ppm of copper was found. Rubber check valve leaked overnight. Eight more persons became ill before problem was found.
1957, Los Angeles, California
A small particle which appeared to be a piece of gasket lodged under the single ball, held in place by a spring, of the check valve of a beverage machine. Two persons became ill. Analysis showed 260 ppm copper in the water taken directly from the carbonator, and 110 ppm copper in a drink drawn from beverage machine.
1968, Salt Lake City, Utah
A faulty carbonator check valve caused blue water to the ice machine and bad tasting water at a restaurant.
1977, Burlington, Vermont
Carbon dioxide and carbonated water backflowed into the copper piping in a hospital causing copper poisoning in 38 persons. Copper levels in samples collected from the water system ranged from 7 to 70 ppm.
1977, Wenatchee, Washington
Two persons suffered typical symptoms of copper poisoning after drinking root beer from a beverage machine following the backflow of carbon dioxide into the copper water supply piping.
