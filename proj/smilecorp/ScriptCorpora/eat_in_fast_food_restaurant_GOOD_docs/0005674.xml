 What an asshole seeking attention and taking it out on a poor, defenceless low-paid worker. No, I&apos;m not that person.

Yeah..she most definitely was a bitch..
Today this happened to me. I told her she should give them a break..There were only 3 people working. One on grill, one at drive thru, and one on the front line taking orders. Her kids were begging her to just be quiet, she just kept on and on..After I basically told her to chill out (I wasn&apos;t hateful when I said it)She started freaking out, calling me names, telling me to meet her outside, like she wanted to fight..ugh..
THEN after she got her food, she went out and threw her drinks all over my van...and sped off.. I called the cops. My children were in the van when she did it...thats just unacceptable..

You have got to be kidding me! OMG! What a Juvenile way of dealing with this! Three minutes is not a lifetime of waiting for a burger! This woman obviously has major anger issues. Sorry that you had to run into someone so rude and insensitive. I can&apos;t stand folks like that! Those kinds of people is what gives humanity a bad name!!! What did the police say?

He told me to get all the names of the witnesses. And that I have a year to file for a warrant for her arrest. I see this woman every day when I pick my daughter up from school, so if I have any more trouble from her, I&apos;m going to cause a whole lot of trouble for her.

 I don&apos;t complain, other than to ask the management if he has any openings, since he seems short handed. I know a lot of people who need work and are pretty desperate.

I&apos;ve already found jobs for half a dozen friends of my grandsons.
