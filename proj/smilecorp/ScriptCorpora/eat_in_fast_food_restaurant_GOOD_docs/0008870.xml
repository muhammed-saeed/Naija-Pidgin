 That &quot;integration&quot; thing is not over‘til it’s over, is apparently the thinking of rural Louisiana school bus driver Delores Davis, i.e., Rosa Parks, Brown v. Board of Education being sooo 1950s! Davis allegedly forced 9 black elementary-school kids to the back of her bus so whites could sit up front.

Backstage was late today, but just &apos;cause Blogger went down right in the middle of uploading my post. (And, for those just joining us, Backstage appears Mon-Wed-Fri this month, but back to 6-day posts in September.)
 
 An F State dirty-bookstore customer apparently had an epiphany while watching a porno flick and decided to repent on the spot , by setting fire to the store as he was walking out . . . . . It didn’t get that far in Gautier, Miss., though, because a Waldenbooks stuck all its &quot;relationships&quot;-type books in the storeroom so it wouldn’t further anger the one offended woman who has been hassling them for 4 months.

 The ol’public utilities shell game, in Denver: Water’s too expensive, so you conscientiously conserve it, and thus consumption goes down, which means the utility has to raise rates because it’s not selling enough water .

 Underappreciated in the 24-hr, 2-minute race of those two guys who set a new speed record for NYC subway travel (passing by all 468 stations in the system): They had to squeeze their bladders and sphincters. The subway system has 70 men’s rooms, but they’ve long been off-limits to passengers, and the Transit Authority said it would take a freedom of information act demand for them to release the locations. The news reports don’t explicitly say that they didn’t tinkle somewhere, but the plan was not to, and when the guys pulled in to the last station, their first order of business was begging a TA employee to get‘em to a john. [CORRECTION: An TA honcho says the restrooms are public, and a list of their locations probably isn&apos;t as obscure as the actual train schedules, which the two men seem to have employed just fine in timing their run. Yr Editor is thus totally confused.] 

 Britain’s ITV channel reported that Madonna is lobbying the Prime Minister and the Dept of Trade and Industry to use a super-mystical Kabbalah fluid to clean up the world’s radioactive waste.

 Here’s an ideal candidate for hard-time boot-camp punishment, but the judge will certainly wuss out. Michael Loughner, 14, is apparently still ticked after 3 yrs that neighbor Alexandria Carasia didn’t get along with the Loughner family cat, which was eventually farmed out to the grandparents. Michael’s revenge: Allegedly, he meows, incessantly, every time he’s around Carasia. Incessantly. 3 yrs. A judge in Jeannette, Pa., will undoubtedly work out some damned compromise.

 September Harper’s magazine has an excerpt from a bio of an alleged ex-mistress of Osama bin Laden, which reveals lots o’stuff on the pious cave man, including his drooling over Whitney Houston and his fondness for Miami Vice, McGyver, and The Wonder Years.

 I’m sorry, but it’s beginning to look to me like that astrology thing doesn’t make sense. I mean, the notable British astrologer Russell Grant said it won’t make a bit of difference to his analysis that Pluto has been downgraded by scientists.

 In ABC Primetime’s latest &quot;medical mystery&quot; segment, a doctor in India, thinking he was removing a huge abdominal tumor from a 36-yr-old man, was &quot;shock[ed]&quot;: &quot;To my surprise and horror, I could shake hands with somebody inside.&quot; &quot;First, one limb came out, then another limb came out. Then some part of genitalia, then some part of hair, some limbs, jaws, limbs, hair.&quot; It was the man’s fetal twin , trapped inside him and leeching off him for 36 yrs.

Just in time for the 5th anniversary of 9-11, TSA finally decides it would be better if hijackers couldn’t instantaneously spot the only man on board they needed to disarm . . . . . Love those super-optimistic perverts, like this guy, all loaded up with Viagra, camera, short shorts, and porn (including one photo taped to the handlebars of his bike), as if the ladies are dying to try him out . . . . . A New York woman pleaded guilty to embezzling $2.3m from her employer--- just to play the lotteries (about $6k worth of tickets a day) . . . . . The NY Times decides that what is needed in American journalism right now is a full-time fragrance critic . . . . . High school football season opens this weekend in the F State, which means that playing linebacker for South Sumter High will be an 11th-grader named Yourhighness Morgan .

 First, it was Google, with editorless news. Now comes word that Thomson Financial will publish writerless news . We’re all doomed. Thomson has a bot that will write a story about a corporation’s earnings report. Yr Editor thinks News of the Weird is safe for the time being, although a couple of themes might be bot-ready: (1) The pet-hoarding story: Perhaps an algorithm could pick out number, species, inches of feces throughout the house, distance at which neighbors began to notice, number with mange (er, number of animals, not neighbors), etc. (2) Also, maybe the dropped-ID theme: name of bank, type of ID (with codes for driver’s license, deposit slip, utility bill, pay stub, appointment-reminder for next meeting with probation officer), number of minutes until perp was collared, etc.

 Recurring Themes 
 Here’s one similar in nature to that Uzbekistan report carried here last week [Backstage, 8-18-2006] of one guy suffocating in a manure pit, then six more guys die, seriatim , as they dive in to rescue him. Today’s would be the report from Hawaii that, first, two kids were killed when their car ran off the road, and then, 19 hours later, four of their friends gathered at the site in remembrance when another car smashed into them, killing one and putting the others in critical condition. And, then . . ..?
 In April, Yr Editor mentioned the 32-yr-old New Zealander who drives up a storm though missing his arms (uses one leg for the gas, one to steer) [NOTW 951, 4-30-2006] , but now comes Michael Wiley down here near Weird Central, who drives and drives and drives (mostly recklessly) despite almost constant license revocation, with said revocation due mainly to the fact that he is missing not only his arms, but half of one leg. Reported the St. Petersburg Times :
 He guides the key into the ignition with his mouth. Turns it with his toes. Shifts with his knee. Bites the headlight switch. Jams his stump of a left arm into the steering wheel and whips it around. The backstory is that he had a really gruesome accident at age 13, and now, 26 yrs later, driving is still the chief tactic in his strategy of denial. What would you do to get that license back, the Times asked him. &quot;I’d give my right leg.&quot; [ Update : One day, one mother-lovin&apos; day, after the story appeared, he was arrested again .]

 Chutzpah: Former mayor Philip Giordano of Waterbury, Conn., now serving 37 yrs for schtupping children, filed a claim with the city for $61k in accrued vacation- and sick-pay . (And anyway, elected officials don’t ever get those things) . . . . . Verizon said there is absolutely no connection between (a) the federal gov’t’s dropping of a $1.25/$2.83 fee on DSL service and (b) Verizon’s immediate decision to impose its own $1.20/$2.70 fee on DSL service.

 Your Daily [Islamic] Devotion: Clerics in India have ruled that a &quot;taraq taraq taraq&quot; divorce shout, even if the husband is drunk at the time, is binding and that, even though he has changed his mind now, the ex-wife must have an interim, minimum-one-day marriage before she can go back to this father of her 3 children (and the interim man must be at least 70 yrs old).

Reminder: Only Mon-Wed-Fri posts in August; back on schedule in September.

Prepare for yet another invasion of Mexicans, as super-religious parents, grossed out by explicit new school sex ed textbooks, flee to America, where school boards can shield their kids from that grossness . . . . . Most colleges that field football teams aspire to athletic greatness, but a few apparently do it just to be seltzer-squirted by major-conference teams for the $600k-and-up game fees . . . . . Bryant Weiford, 20, smashed through the front of a Kmart in Hampton, Va., exited, and calmly began shopping (well, trying on women’s shoes ), even though it was the middle of the night . . . . . An AP report from Bismarck, N.D., sez Terry Morris and Renee Biwer tied the knot, with Terry’s hen (&quot;Henrietta&quot;) the maid of honor ( and traveling companion on their honeymoon) . . . . .

 Bringing art to the people: The director of a gallery in Penzance, England, scheduled a show by Kira O’Reilly Friday night &quot;to provide audiences in the region with opportunities to see the kind of works that they [ordinarily would] have to go to London to experience.&quot; Such a work would be Ms. O’Reilly’s &quot;Inthewrongplaceness,&quot; which consists of a naked woman holding a dead pig for four hours .

 From the just-out autobio of staid football announcer Pat Summerall: He at first didn’t take to his liver-transplant medication well: &quot;What do you think is wrong with me? My lips just fell off! Quick, grab my arm--it’s going, too. And my leg!&quot; Writes Richard Sandomir in the NY Times : &quot;[Summerall] also sheared off some of his hair with an electric razor in an inexplicable effort to resemble Bruce Willis.&quot; Summerall: &quot;Why I had to look like Bruce Willis, I don’t know. I’m not a particular fan of his.&quot;

 Good news and bad news for those born with one too many: The World Aquarium in St. Louis has this week lined up a celebration for 19 animals born with 2 heads , mostly snakes and turtles. (The two-headed kitten that made the news in June passed away.) What say two of the snakes mate and make a four? The bad news comes from India where a 24-yr-old human with two penii plans surgery to get normal. (That’s a condition that &quot;doctors say&quot; is present in maybe 100 men on Earth. It also is another one of those things that present challenges for Intelligent Design people.)

 Recurring Themes 
There is no recurring theme that gives Yr Editor more pleasure than news about the person whose day is ruined when he is hit by a flying cow. And readers should rejoice, as well. Your life may be going south; your Zoloft may be losing sting; Armageddon may be around the corner. But, at least you didn’t get hit by a flying cow. Sally Brown, 51, did, though , on Britain’s Isle of Wight, when one fell off a cliff above Brown’s home. It was fatal for the cow, painful for Brown.

 Updates 
 The bench-warrant-ignoring attorney gen’l of New Jersey, Zulima Farber [NOTW 948, 4-9-2006] , finally quit last week over the charge that she big-footed state troopers when her boyfriend got traffic-stopped two months ago. The boyfriend’s name: Mr. Goore---Mr. Hamlet Goore.
 The Oklahoma penis-pumping judge, Donald Thompson [NOTW 940, 2-12-2006] , was sentenced to 4 yrs in prison , still in denial.
 The Filipino dwarf-consulting judge [Backstage, 5-4-2006] ---oh, wait, he denied it [Backstage, 8-1-2006] ---was officially kicked off the bench .

It says on the right-hand rail that Yr Editor posts 6 days a week, but in August, as previously announced, it’s only on Mon-Wed-Fri. Back full-time in September.

A Nebraska federal judge, and now the Court of Appeals, says police can assume the $124k cash you’re carrying is drug money , even if you and your record are clean . . . . . Now-- hot dogs sprayed with a virus! --and the FDA said it’s a good thing . . . . . The Las Vegas City Council made it illegal to sleep within 500 ft of street pee-pee and caca , but then said they made a mistake and would repeal the law at their next meeting (after which it’ll again be perfectly OK to sleep with pee-pee and caca) . . . . . For every disappointment, there must be a lawsuit: Ulysee Maillot, 62, got all excited that his number had won a big Quebec lottery, but it was the Montreal Gazette’s bad , and now he wants money for that .

 Judges Gone Wild: (in descending order of oblivitude) (1) Gary McKinley of Kenton, Ohio, who said &quot;I shouldn’t even be doing this&quot; and then proceeded to prove his point by deferring punishment until after the coming season for 2 star high school football players, whose immature stunt left one man brain-damaged and another phyisically disabled (and the after-season sentence is only 60 days, anyway). (2) James McGuinness Jr of Lowell, Mass., who promised a recidivist assault convictee freedom if she’d merely recite the Pledge of Allegiance, and after she got to the end of the first line, he said, ehhh, that’s good enough. (3) Paul Zellerbach of Riverside, Calif., who was reprimanded this week by the state judicial agency for declining to leave an Angels-Red Sox playoff game in 2004 to come right back to court and hear a jury verdict in a double murder case. (4) On the other hand, Julia Jent of Portage, Ind., issued a positively sublime decision, ordering several teenagers with traffic tickets to ride the school bus to and from every day , a sentence which apparently totally grossed out the sobbing little brats: &quot;Oh my God,&quot; said Jent, of one of the kids, &quot;You would have thought I gave her and her mother the death penalty.&quot;

 And speaking of stunts, Mr. Kaleb Spangler duct-taped a large firework to a football helmet, put it on, and lit it. He’s really messed up now, but at least he’s still alive, and if you&apos;re in Indiana, Kaleb’s votes count just as much as yours.

 Boy George had it about right (from Andrea Peyser’s NY Post column on Tuesday) , when he was jeered by reporters and neighborhood humps while doing his community-service street-sweeping sentence. When one of the star-sniffers combatively said, &quot;[Y]ou’re really pathetic,&quot; B.G. replied, &quot; You’re the one following me [around] cleaning. Who needs to get a fucki*g life?&quot; [emphasis in original] 

 Sounds like a story idea from Curb Your Enthusiasm : Randy Bailey, on house arrest with an ankle monitor that has a 4-minute delay, decided to dash down the street to the Burger King for a Whopper, yet still get back before the alarm went off at the St. Paul, Minn., police dept. Wouldn’t you know it, slow servers [Yr Editor’s &quot;Saturday Night Fast-Food Restaurant Peril Theory&quot;]. Bailey went nuts on the drive-thru window (and will face a felony property-destruction charge)---but he made it home with seconds to spare. [Note: The SNFFRPT holds that the teenagers forced to work the Saturday night shift are so very disgruntled that every customer is in mortal danger (and that you should say a prayer that the kids merely spit on your Big Mac.] 

 Recurring Themes: Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka, doing their best Ultimate Fighting imitation after Tamil Tiger protestors dissed them . . . . . In Uzbekistan, another of those &quot;one guy falls into manure pit and the would-be rescuers die one-by-one as they jump in to save him.&quot;

 Updates 
Regarding the story at the top of Wednesday’s post [Backstage, 8-16-2006] , a reader points out that the high pregnancy rate for girls at Timken High School, Canton, Ohio, is especially poignant in that the school’s teams’nickname is the Trojans.
I reported in this week’s NOTW [966, 8-13-2006] , that some criminals apparently believe marijuana is odorless, citing a guy in Tucson, Ariz., who had two tons of it in his house (when police were called to a neighbor’s for an unrelated reason). Well, apparently, the issue is Tucson. Since it’s a key logistical point for smugglers, the above was the 7th stash-house bust in the city in 2006, and last Sunday came the 8th , of nearly one ton.

Cankton, La., pop. 388, needs a police chief to stand for election in September because the mayor doesn’t know whether the incumbent will run again or even where he is (since he might have moved to Mississippi) . . . . .

 Here’s your smoking gun on sex education in schools (unless there’s more here than meets the eye): The Canton, Ohio, school board’s centerpiece of sex ed is abstinence, but it now says a modification is due, after the stats came in: Of 490 female students at Timken High School last yr, 65 got pregnant .

 The heavy-metal scene in Egypt? Yep. But the music’s gotta stop when the local mosque blares out the calls to prayer. And though goatees and spiked hair are OK, no drugs or booze or heavy goth makeup. &quot;We are here,&quot; said one partier, &quot;because we cannot live without our music. &quot;

 Candidate Mania: (1) A former ACLU lawyer running for Congress in Arizona is suing her husband’s ex-wife for telling voters that the hubby is between $500 thousand and $750 thousand [probably Cdn] behind in child support . (2) Ohio Democratic Congressional candidate Stephanie Studebaker is no soft, touchy-feely Democrat---no, wait, she is touchy-feely : She and her husband were both charged with beating each other up , and she has suspended her campaign.

 The Clinton-Gates-Buffett African AIDS mission has its work cut out: At the International AIDS conference in Toronto this week, the South African kiosk featured apples, nectarines, lemons, and garlic, as demanded by the country’s health minister, who is big on nutrition as the key to fighting HIV . (Only after some murmuring was a display of anti-retroviral drugs added.)

 In other words, yuk-yuk-yuk, those ignorant, backward African countries! And aren’t we in the great US of A privileged to live in the vanguard of intellectual advancement! Er, well, there’s this survey , from a Michigan State researcher, showing that, when it comes to accepting the science of evolution, the U.S. more resembles a cargo-cult country than it does Europe and Japan.

 Ready for the new Sally Struthers infomercial, &quot;Won’t you please donate your used thighmasters?&quot; At an int’l conference in Australia, U. of North Carolina Prof. Barry Popkin said the current global figures are: 850 million undernourished, one billion fat people .

 The former head of the NY Stock Exchange, Ratso Riz--no, no, Greedo Grasso, might be ready to come out of the transgender closet soon , according to Monday’s NY Post . That is, his 1995 employment contract specified that his pension would have life expectancy determined by a traditional male-mortality table, but by the time of the 2003 contract, life expectancy was to be determined 50 percent by male-mortality and 50 percent by female-. Ehhh, it was probably just a ruse to get a fatter pension. [Or . . . was it ?]

 Recurring Theme: Those awful things, those breast implants, are at least good for something , like stopping shrapnel from an Israeli bomb (as a bullet had been diverted years ago by an F State stripper’s implant [NOTW 307, 12-24-1993] ). [CORRECTED: It was an Hizbollah rocket, hitting an Israeli woman.] 

 Update 
U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns was reportedly widely and here [Backstage, 7-28-2006] as critical of out-of-state firefighters who had come to help Montanans subdue a blaze in July, telling some exhausted, bedraggled men as they were ready to leave that they did a &quot;poor job.&quot; Well, it was worse than that. The Billings Gazette reported yesterday that the actual terminology was &quot;a piss-poor job,&quot; that the team &quot;didn’t do a goddamned thing.&quot; (Burns now says that he was just representing his disgruntled constituent-farmers who had complained that their suggestions to the firefighters had been insufficiently appreciated.)

I’ll probably post some more stories this afternoon [CORRECTED: I already did] , but I’m still sticking to my August schedule, as previously announced: Only Mon-Wed-Fri posts until the end of the month, when I’ll be back to 6 days a week.

Yr Editor doesn’t know what’s going on up there in Holyoke, Mass., but the police chief just described a domestic fight in which a woman stabbed her beau in his (and I quote) &quot;winky&quot; . . . . . An ice-cream truck driver (with his obnoxious jingle player still going ) was shot to death in Chicago, and police professed that they didn’t know any motive. Really? . . . . . Sounds like a joke: Zookeepers in Netherlands and Indonesia are planning an Internet connection between their respective orangutans , for kind of a visual chatroom . . . . . A UK Passport office rejected the application photo of a 5-yr-old girl because her bare shoulders were visible , which the employee thought might be offensive if her family traveled to a Muslim country . . . . . Two local councils in Australia have interpreted the &quot;outdoor smoking areas&quot; of bars to actually prohibit entry to nonsmokers . . . . .

 Yr Editor spent most of the 1970s as a federal bureaucrat and observed gobs of the usual downtime and inefficiencies, about which were created many anecdotes that endured dinner parties and classrooms over the years, but apparently Emily Hesaltine, 20, is a better person than I---interested in service, not anecdotes. According to this Washington Post story , she has used her 2-month internship at Federation of American Scientists to basically rewrite, much more helpfully, the entire emergency-preparedness website of the Dept of Homeland Security (after finding the DHS site full of obvious or dubious or repetitive or unhelpful or vastly-overwritten advice). Basically, she called into question the work of at least several highly-paid, civil-service-status-conscious, unindustrious, poor-judgmented, and cynical (i.e., not to realize that many Americans would turn to their marginally-useful site out of stark fear in an emergency) bureaucrats---and then did a better job by herself, in 2 months, at age 20. DHS’s response, apparently, was predictable, e.g., oh, no, she got this thing on this section wrong, and then, on that section over there, that part was confusing, etc. The DHS site is Ready.gov ; the FAS rewrite is ReallyReady.org .

 They’re mad as hell, and they’re not gonna take it anymore! They’re just the latest courageous public-policy freedom-fighters who say that enough is enough, that they’re tired of always backing down. No more cowering. It ends here. And Yr Editor is referring of course to, er, pedophiles. Two weeks ago, it was Phillip Distasio, defiant as he prepares for trial in Cleveland [Backstage, 8-3-2006] . And now Christopher Palmieri complains, in Bristol, Conn., that stayaway orders against child molesters are unwise and unfair, that they &quot;will turn a [mere] pedophile into a murderer.&quot; Besides, he said, if you see a 7-yr-old with a pedophile, it’s usually the 7-yr-old’s doing.

 And speaking of underage sex, a woman and her boyfriend and the woman’s 15-yr-old daughter apparently wrote out a contract (and signed it) specifying that while the woman is laid up from surgery for 2 months, the daughter will take her place in bed in exchange for certain gifts. (And did I mention that this was written out . . . and signed? )

 Yr Editor has never been to North Platte, Neb., so surely Joshua Shores, 34, who works at a Subway sandwich shop there, knows the relative IQ level in the community better than I do, but still . . .: When surveillance video showed that he was the guy who pocketed $502 instead of putting it into the safe, he answered that he was working undercover for the CIA and not to sweat the $502, that the agency would take care of it.

 Update 
We knew life was cheap in the F State when one guy at a bar killed another guy for spilling beer on him [Backstage, 5-31-2006] , but it just got cheaper: The alleged perp, Eduardo Gonzalez, 18, has now been charged with ordering hits on five witnesses to the shooting. That would be 6 people dying over a spilled beer. (Fortunately, as always, the search for an actual hit man to pull it off led to an undercover cop.)

 This story theme, emanating almost exclusively from Japan, has previously involved sorta tacky attempts to retaliate for some slight or other, such as being fired or not being promoted, or being jilted by a lover. This guy, though, made his 37,000 talk-free phone calls this year to directory-assistance, just to hear female operators’voices. Surely this level of boredom, and misplaced industriousness, is unknown outside of Japan.

 ABC’s show PrimeTime profiled Camille , a quite successful looker and schoolteacher, but with a lifelong malady called trimethylaminuria, which means that she usually smells like that Dumpster behind the fish market . (And everyone can smell it but her.)

 And speaking of fish, we license fishermen, but not parents: LaToya Joplin stands accused of beating her 3-yr-old daughter to death but told a sheriff’s detective that the abuse-ee here is really herself , since her hand was throbbing with pain, in that discipline required that she keep up the beating because the girl never said &quot;ouch&quot; or anything. (Seriously.)

 People With Too Much Money: Well, Ruth Regina hasn’t actually put her dog wigs out on her store’s shelves yet , but she’s almost ready. Ruth is a well known hair outfitter for the stars in Miami, ready to branch out with such designs as the &quot;Peek a Bow Wow,&quot; falling down over part of a dog’s &quot;face,&quot; for sexiness. &quot;There’s some dogs that have the come-hither look.&quot;

 A story in London’s Wednesday Sun didn’t tell the actual day of this misadventure, but the inconvenience surely rivaled that of what happened Thursday on England-arriving flights. A Thomson flight from Cancun to Birmingham (9 hours) was over the Atlantic when the pilot informed the 295 passengers that, since the ground crew in Cancun had forgotten to empty the toilets , they were now jam-packed and that they’d have to hold it in. Well, no, they went back to Goose Bay, Canada.

 Least Competent Criminals: Brit Craig Moore is the latest not to understand that it doesn’t matter what you do to a surveillance camera because all the images are stored in a base unit elsewhere (so that, when he blew up a roadside speed camera to destroy evidence, not only was the photo of his car not affected but neither was the picture of him, as he approached the camera to kill it) . . . . . Police in Tampa report that the unidentified guy who robbed a Bank of America on August 2 still hasn’t sought medical help, which they’re sure he’d have to get after the chemical dye pack blew up when he stuffed his stash bag inside his pants (that’s, er, 425 degrees F).

 Sculptor Daniel Edwards, who did the fanciful objet of Britney Spears nude on all fours dropping little Sean Preston [NOTW 953, 5-14-2006] , has now unveiled a breast-dominated bust of Hillary Clinton for NY’s Museum of Sex.

Several readers referred to me an e-mail sent yesterday by WashingtonPost.com , drumming up website clicks by describing news and features, including the line &quot;Looking for news of the weird? Try one of our newest blogs,‘Off/Beat’&quot; (referring to a feature with oh-so-zany stories). Each of the readers was indignant on behalf of Yr Editor. Well, WashingtonPost.com shouldn’t have written what it did, but legally (and morally), the matter is just too ambiguous for Yr Editor to complain about. &quot;[n]ews of the weird&quot; (but not &quot;News of the Weird&quot;) has a generic meaning to the worldwide Internet audience of the Post (though less so in the Washington, D.C., service area, where NOTW has been a major media presence for almost 19 yrs now). Plus, let’s face it, among the things you get with this diffusion of media enabled by the Internet are decentralization of decision-making and laxness of pre-publication vetting. That is, decisions on the wording of this e-mail were almost certainly made by people less sophisticated than old-line media people about such things as trademarks.

 Mr. Abdullah Date, 18, steamed that he was charged with crack cocaine possession in NYC, decided to taunt the cops by sending a white powder to the station, with the note, &quot;Ha, Ha, [you] thought it was anthrax&quot; and &quot;Catch me if you can.&quot; Also, it was signed &quot;Abdullah Date&quot; with his home address on the envelope .

Listen up. Yr Editor is going into semi-hibernation mode for August, which means nothing except that I’ll probably post only Mon-Wed-Fri until the end of the month. I’ll still be at work every day, just not with as much intensity. All mail will be dealt with. However, it’s a fact that August is the worst news month of the year and thus the worst weird -news month. Exceptions will be handled appropriately, though; please keep tuning in. Cheers.

 Punctuation Counts: Canada’s telecom regulators cost a company an extra $2.13m (Cdn) over a comma : Its agreement &quot;shall continue in force for a period of five years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.&quot; (The company thought it had a 5-yr deal; the regulators said it was terminable at will with 1 yr’s notice.) [Yr Editor, being an editor, understands. I don’t condone it, but I understand.]

 Germany’s Max Planck Institute, a sort of minor league version of the Pentagon’s DARPA (except MPI doesn’t just think of stuff, but actually does the work, too) is working to make mice and fruit flies less stupid .

 Speaking of which, 50 percent of Americans believe Iraq actually had WMDs, which is a position the Bush Administration has officially abandoned, and also represents a 39 percent increase in stupidity since last yr, when only 36 percent of Americans believed it. [By the way, don’t fall for the Santorum Revelation, that 500 chemical weapons had been found since 2003: Those dead stockpiles of chemical weapons were no part of the Bush Administration’s advocacy of urgent invasion of Iraq in 2002-2003, which was based on Saddam’s immediate ability to attack its neighbors.]

 U.S. Rep. Cynthia &quot;Get Your Hands Off Me, Copper&quot; McKinney might not survive her Democratic primary runoff tomorrow, but she may have a better chance than commentators believe. A USA Today story on Friday revealed that her office’s automatic telephone greeting as recently as the July 29 weekend was the same one that played earlier in the month and urged callers to vote in the original primary on &quot;July 20.&quot; That primary was actually on July 18. Hence, she may have more voters show up tomorrow than were able to vote for her on the 18th.

 The L.A.

 F State readers start through the Wall Street Journal piece this morning [pay per view] [free story summary here] about Mimi Monica Wong, 61, widowed, signing a contract to pay a dance-teacher couple US$15.4m for 2 yrs worth of rumba lessons, and they yawn; it’s a little extravagant compared to the Florida retirees’losses, but it’s the same ol’game. Except that it’s not. Wong is a high-class Hong Kong private banker with a well-heeled client list, and there’s an int’l championship Latin dance circuit on which she wants to excel, and actually, this was more like a rich amateur paying Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf $15.4m to devote themselves entirely for 2 yrs to making her one of the best tennis players in the world. (It fell apart the day one of the coaches told Wong to move &quot;fat ass&quot; out there, that she was a &quot;lazy cow,&quot; and it went downhill from there, until she finally sued for the $8m advance she had paid, while the coaches countersued for the other $7.4m.) She’s back at work giving financial advice while the lawsuit plays out, and she’s paying her new rumba coach only $250k a year.

 In a heartbreaking work of staggering bad-dogism, Barney the watchdog went nuts at a British children’s museum and chewed up $900k worth of antique teddy bears (including one once owned by Elvis).

Starting with the column that will appear on August 6, Yr Editor is revisiting (in weekly bunches) all of the No Longer Weirds, which began appearing in NOTW in 1996. There’s a badly-in-need-of-update list here , [CORRECTION: If this link is Blogger-dead, just go to the NewsoftheWeird.com intro page and click the No Longer Weird-highlighted link in the 3rd paragraph] which many readers heed, but not the new readers, who have this week flooded Yr Editor with the story of the Westlake, Ohio, cocktail waitress who, upon asking for ID from a young woman, was then presented with the waitress’s own (stolen) driver’s license . Certainly used to be weird, but no longer.

William Lyttle, 75, who owns a substantial house in East London, England, has this problem (as mentioned in NOTW 711, 9-23-2001 ): For reasons known only to William Lyttle, he burrows incessantly under it (and in 2001, under the property line, causing part of the street to collapse). Now, however, the totality of the extensive, Hezbollah-like tunnelwork underneath has made the town council wary that the entire house could collapse , especially since Lyttle has (surprise!) weighed it down with so much personal junk. The house would be worth the equivalent of $1.5m or more if it were in good repair, which it’s not.

 Osama bin Laden was a fidgety‘fraidy cat whenever he heard boom-booms , said a former associate for an upcoming CNN docu, In the Footsteps of bin Laden. But he &quot;toughened&quot; himself by watching Bruce Lee movies and [are you sitting down? are you ready for this?] Peter Graves’s TV show. But not the Mission Impossible TV show. No. Before that. Peter Graves starring in the Saturday morning kids’horse show Fury (which came on right before Sky King ).

 But are we safe? A court in London last week acquitted three guys of trying to buy material for a dirty bomb, leaving the implication that the magnitude of the talk-of-the-town plot was more in the imagination of News of the World investigative ace Mazher Mahmood than a serious threat. The all-purpose-tech website The Register more chastises British security than Mahmood , though, because the WMD substance the men were seeking, &quot;red mercury,&quot; doesn’t existent. If British security knew that, why make such a big splash? And if British security actually didn’t know it was bogus, well, whoa nelly!

 Stafford, Tex., adjacent to Tom DeLay’s Sugar Land, wants to discourage church-building because it has 51 now, and unless actual businesses come to the remaining land, it’ll never get enough tax money to pay the bills. The churches say they can’t help it, that they pray about where to locate, and God says,
&quot;Stafford.&quot; Well, at least God talks to flavor after flavor of evangelical protestants, but so far Stafford has no synagogue. (There are even synagogues in Iran, but apparently those congregations are Iranian first , Jewish second.)

 Tom Wittman’s problem is that he insists on telling you how smart he is. Instead of quietly converting his‘94 Saturn to electricity and being done with it, he gave the Alton (Ill.)

But it cost him 8-thousand-something to rebuild his car for electricity. Even at a $90/month gas bill, he won’t break even until 2014 .

A reader pointed me to a membership bulletin of that church in Manchester, England, that held the fundraising car wash with &quot;holy water,&quot; and I plan to issue the following Clarification, in NOTW 966, 8-13-2006 :
 CLARIFICATION: In a column three weeks ago, I noted (based on a BBC News report) that a Baptist church in Manchester, England, had staged a fundraising car wash using leftover baptismal water, which a church spokesman had referred to as &quot;blessed&quot; (and BBC News had referred to as &quot;holy&quot;). However, the church, in its members’bulletin, had specifically rejected the idea that baptismal water be considered &quot;blessed.&quot; Had I known of the church bulletin, I would not have regarded the story as worthy of News of the Weird. (My earlier comment [Backstage, 7-24-2006] regarding the use of &quot;holy water&quot; stands, however. Though Catholics [and perhaps others] may view &quot;holy water&quot; as having a fixed and unique set of properties, the phrase, er, secularly, indicates only water that has allegedly been imbued with some spiritual characteristic.)

 U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana showed he’s not all that into political correctness, either. He walked up to some exhausted, out-of-state, $15-$20/hour firefighters at the Billings airport and told them they did a &quot;poor job&quot; fighting that 92,000-acre blaze near Billings this month (just because some farmers had complained to him that fire captains, and not farmers, were in charge of firefighting scenes).

The Select Board of Springfield, Vt., has denied Paul Murphy’s straightforward application for a liquor license, but based on incomplete paperwork, not because the prospective place of liquor-dispensing was Murphy’s cell at the state prison . . . . . 3 words: meat ice cream (but it’s only for overheated Zurich Zoo animals) . . . . . Most doctors with hobbies choose, y’know, golf, things like that, but a U of Texas Medical Branch hospital doctor chooses (according to police) the pastime of drive-by shooting . . . . . A dog hoarder in Wichita-- with 68 pit bulls . . . . . On the shelves of a few convenience stores in Miami: $3 crack kits (glass pipe, Brillo pad, lighter). Posted by Chuck at 10:41:00 AM

 Recurring Themes: Another no-show, glorified-sperm-donor-of-a-father, Mr. Ruben Martinez, nonetheless was awarded half of the $1m remaining after his disabled daughter succumbed to her birth defect . . . . . Transcendental Meditation people said Israel shouldn’t waste artillery and air power, that 265 &quot;yogic flyers&quot; (you remember them, the crossed-leg butt-hoppers) can protect Israelis perfectly well by imagining an aura around the country . . . . . Hoarders: It took a federal court decision to make it official, but Sam Shipkovitz (PhD, JD) is so messy that he’s a legitimate local gov’t problem.

 Below The Fold 
A judge in Japan ruled that it’s illegal sexual harassment for a man to pressure a co-worker to pluck his beard . . . . . Man, how do they do it: first, Japan’s Kobayaski cramming down all those hot dogs, and now an unnamed Korean cramming down at least 3.5 lbs of cocaine balloons (which Customs officials in Nigeria are getting him to excrete) . . . . . A celebrity seeks a court order to limit nosy Chicago news persons from reporting about her home, and by &quot;celebrity,&quot; I mean a nosy Chicago news person (the city’s highest paid TV anchor).

About . . .
 Yr Editor is not a &quot;blogger&quot; but rather, for 23 years, a weekly compiler of choice underreported bizarreness, ironies, absurdities, and deliciousness that might especially appeal to intellectually upmarket people like yourselves. I don&apos;t do daily reports, nor sell my soul for link-clicking, nor aim to gather y&apos;all in a Facebook, Twitter, or blog forum family. All I do is read the hell out of the news (online and dead-tree), and follow all the tips y&apos;all give me, and then figure out the stuff that tickles me (or scares me) the most every week. That means the News of the Weird newspaper column on Sundays and the online News of the Weird 2.0 on two or more other days of the week, depending on energy level.
 
Newza da Weird . . .
 News of the Weird is the weekly syndicated newspaper column, accessible every Sunday at NewsoftheWeird.com 
 News of the Weird 2.0 is a two-or-three times weekly online compilation of the most recent news--with links to each story. You can read NOTW 2.0 here or on WeirdUniverse.net .

 
News Tips . . .
 are welcomed, of course, and Yr Editor processes each one with his own two eyes, but keep in mind that I am indeed a &quot;Pro,&quot; and if a story is front-and-center on news sites, I&apos;ve seen it. However, tips from specialty, or out-of-the-way (but legitimate) news sources make me all tingly. (By the way, I am sorry to report that I am unfortunately inconsistent in acknowledging contributions, and I hope you&apos;ll forgive me in advance. In any event, please, no scans, or attachments, or product press releases, or joke stuff. Write WeirdNews at the domain earthlink dot net, especially if you find an error of fact in my work.)
 
Blogs I Read . . .
 Of course I read Fark.com . You&apos;re probably too busy to spend much time there, but I&apos;m not.
 Alex, Paul, and I started Weird Universe in July 2008, then opened it up to citizen-bloggers, who keep it humming.
 Meet Kev, the hardest-working man in weird news, live from Arbroath, Scotland, every (and I mean every ) morning.
 Nothing to Do with Arbroath 
 For over a decade, the prime purveyor of the dark side in weird news (although irregular recently): Rotten News 
 Yes , I comb through Drudge twice a day, and I do wish Huffington Post weren&apos;t so visually disturbing that I could spend more time there, for balance.
 And it&apos;s hard to be an educated person these days without sampling Boing Boing every day.
