 Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a bear which he often saw at London Zoo, and &quot;Pooh&quot;, a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en-route to England during the First World War. He named the bear &quot;Winnie&quot; after his hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. &quot;Winnie&quot; was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourne left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there.[2] Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.

 Waiting for baby 10/10/2010 by DblAce, Chattanooga,TN 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
We love everything about this Bassinet! The only thing that would make it better would be for the mobile arm to move or rotate out of way when needed. It is stationary in one position. We like the neutral colors and other features.
 Loves it! 10/06/2010 by MsBargainHunter, Cincinnati,OH 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I was able to put this together...pregnant and all...with no problems! It is sturdy and durable. I was really surprised by the price, the quality of the bassinet makes me believe that it should be so much more. My five year old even hangs on it and it with stands his constant pressure! Well worth your money!

A very cute bassinet. My son is no longer using this but while he was he loved the mobile. I loved all the different features to use and it being on wheels makes it very easy to move.

The bassinet was more than we expected from what we saw on the box. After it was put up, the features that it has, was so exciting. My new nephew loves the mobile that came with the bassinet, especially when the lights and music are on. Yes, indeed i would recommend this product to anyone. Thanks

 Gift worth giving 04/07/2010 by bossmomma, Kansas City,Mo 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I purchased this item as a gift for a baby shower. The recipient was very happy. I had a similar product for my child and was extremely happy with it. It is perfect for small spaces and to keep the sleeping infant nearby for tuckered out moms. Very convenient to have the baby right next to my bed for the first couple of weeks when you worry about having them too far away. I had a playpen type bed but used this bassinet more because it took up less space and was easier to work around and I liked the height of the bassinet.

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
this bassinet is absolutely adorable. Easy to put together however the padding for the bassinet seems to be a little thin and may be uncomfortable for my baby he has not arrived yet but i will probably buy different padding for the bassinet before i put him in it. Other than that great and worth it!

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I love this bassinet! The remote control is great and I can turn the vibrating feature on before my newborn starts to be really awake and stop him from making a small fuss without having to get up. I put a 4 since I think the attachment for the mobile and lights gets in the way and it would be great if it can be turned when you try to put your baby in so you can use both sides freely.

I kept reading reviews hoping for some factual information about the real life use of these bassinets and never really found any. I hope to fix that by giving you as much information about the product as I can.

Who am I: I&apos;m the mom of a 3 year old with our second child on the way (he&apos;s due Christmas eve)

When did I buy the bassinet: 3 weeks ago

Did I use a bassinet for our first child: Yes, I used a Graco bassinet that has since been recalled.

Have I looked at any other bassinets: Yes, I purchased (and returned) the Kolcraft Cuddle &apos;n Care Rocking Bassinet, looked at the Learning Curve Carry Me Near 5-in-1 Bassinet at the store, and have a friend who bought (and returned) the Eddie Bauer bassinet. I loved the look of the Kolcraft Cuddle n&apos; Care bassinet but the height doesn&apos;t adjust and it&apos;s very low to the ground for most modern high profile beds. Additionally, it was very flimsy. I&apos;m sure it would have stayed together as expected, but the pieces didn&apos;t fit together tightly and it made moving it difficult. The biggest problem though was the fiber board the mattress sits on. There is a fundamental design issue with this and most Kolcraft bassinets. The cloth walls/skirt attach to the fiber board with snaps on the top side of the board. This causes the mattress to slope into the center. Also the fiber board has no center support and sags in the middle. Sadly, this started to happen to the one I bought even before our baby was in it. I didn&apos;t purchase the Learning Curve Bassinet because the store model fiber board supporting the mattress was already bending in the middle due to the way it&apos;s made for easy packaging. Also, who makes a bassinet where the skirt can&apos;t be washed. That&apos;s just absurd. I like the look of the Eddie Bauer bassinet, but since the height wasn&apos;t adjustable and there were concerns about the rocking mechanism not engaging, I didn&apos;t want to waste my money.

What are the features you should be looking for on
 Very pretty but uncomfortable 12/10/2009 by kab814, Baltimore,MD 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I&apos;m currently using this bassinet for my 1 month old daughter. From the first night we brought her home, she would not sleep in this bassinet. She does like the sounds and lights from the mobile and the vibrate very much, but getting her to sleep in it for more than a half an hour is very rare. I thought it was me, being as though this is my first, I thought I may have spoiled her and not trained her to sleep alone. However, I have tried to slowly get her used to it and it&apos;s just not working.

I am going to try to purchase something else to soften it up to see if that makes it better. I already line the mattress with another blanket and that hasn&apos;t seemed to help. There is a big cardboard piece behind the mattress that holds the vibrate mechanism, and I think that&apos;s the problem. Otherwise, this product would be great. It makes changing diapers and outfits easy and keeps her occupied for a short amount of time if you have something quick to do. And the basket at the bottom is very useful as it keeps her things organized and easy to find. Sadly though, I wished I would have known I couldn&apos;t use it for what it&apos;s ultimately supposed to be used for.

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
We didn&apos;t expect the second baby in a so short interval so we throw away the first bassinet that we got as a gift and it was from delta. We went through all different stores and checked other bassinets online and decided to go back to Delta. It rocks better than any other.

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
Very easy to put together. I did it myself at eight and a half months pregnant ( My husband appreciated that it was something I could put together, he has had his fill with all of the other baby furniture items!). And I love that it comes with the mini screwdriver and wrench that you need to put it together! Very cute design. All of the features are wonderful. Don&apos;t know if I will use the remote, but its nice to have. We can&apos;t wait for our son to get here so he can try it out!

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
This is advertised for infants up to 25 lbs. Per the box and instructions the bassinet is only for babies up to 15lbs. You can use this as a changing table for babies up to 25lbs but not a bassinet...if you are looking for a bassinet for a larger baby this is not it.

 Not That Great... 10/02/2009 by Kiwi03, Las Vegas,NV 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I purchased this for my sister. Initially, I purchased the cheaper one for $45 but then decided to return that one and get her the Winnie the Pooh Bassinett because she absolutly loves Winnie the Pooh. The mattress is pretty hard so blankets will have to be used to soften it up and it doesn&apos;t rock... it vibrates. A bassinett is supposed to rock and a bouncer is supposed to vibrate! Overall I don&apos;t think it is worth much more than the cheaper one - seems like I paid for the brand and not quality. A few plusses to it is that it is very big so he will be able to use it for a while and visually it is very beautiful, also it comes with a remote so if baby likes the sounds and the vibration you dont have to always get up to turn it on while baby is using it.

 A Great Product 09/08/2009 by bromleygirl, Louisiana, 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
My husband and I purchased this bassinet a few months before my son was born. It was really easy to put together and we did it in about 30 minutes. We didn&apos;t have any problems with the mattress like some other reviews said. We used it for about 4 months because my son was premature and small for his age, but the recommended time is 3 months.

My son loved it, and I loved it because it was really easy for me to get up with him and it rolls! :)

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
Very good shape... the baby sleeps in it very well. Only bad part is that my remote doesn&apos;t work, so when the music, vibrate, etc. shuts off, you have to run over and push the button... I have an impatient newborn, so sometimes it is a hassle, but overall I really like the quality for the price. I would recommend it for others.

 good bassinet 08/29/2009 by momtimes4, , 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
Okay here it is...I am having my 4th child. I purchased a bassinet with my 2nd one that was a graco made by simplicity and found out it was recalled after I pulled it out of the basement. I was bummed because it was by far the largest bassinet I had ever found and was very sturdy. I had used it on 2 of my children but since it has been recalled, I didn&apos;t want to chance it. I looked at every bassinet out there by comparision and this one is exactly the same bassinet but now the velcro only comes down halfway and they have the bar in a plastic sleeve so that your child cannot strangle themselves as happened to 2 other children who used the recalled bassinets. We have long children and needed a bigger bassinet and this one was it and we love it! I am giving it 5 stars, it&apos;s really a good bassinet.

This bassinet has been perfect. It cost a little more than some, but it has extras that make the extra cost worth it. The only problem I expect to have is figuring out what to do with it when the baby gets bigger. The lights and the music are so nice, it is just too cute to throw away.

 Great Bassinet! Well worth it for us. 08/24/2009 by Lilmismagick, Florida, 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
This bassinet was one of the best gifts we recieved from our family for our baby. The adjustable height made it easy to keep the bassinet next to our bed, or move it into the babies room when he was down for a nap. Our baby was not really impressed with the mobile and the music or vibrations, but it was nice to have them. The nightlight feature was great for getting up in the middle of the night for feedings. I also used it during those &quot;paranoid mom&quot; moments to make sure he was O.K. while sleeping. The light was not so bright that it would wake the baby up, but good enough to see by, and the remote control made it even easier! The storage on the bottom was great for any extra&apos;s. We kept extra sheets/blankets/diapers etc in it. Some people have complained about the thin mattress pad, and I have to say that I was a little concerned about it when we put it together too, but our baby has not had any problem sleeping in the bassinet. I think he actually prefers the thinner mattress. It isn&apos;t reccomended that small babies sleep on extra &quot;cushy&quot; stuff anyway, due to the increased risk of SIDS so if your baby gets used to being put down in it from the start, you shouldn&apos;t have a problem.
Overall, we&apos;ve used this bassinet for an entire 3 months and it has been great! I am going to be very sad when our baby outgrows it. (which is going to be soon)
 Cute but uncomfortable 08/06/2009 by NewJaMom, Buffalo,NY 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
My husband and I were quite pleased when we received the bassinet. It assembled quite easily, and was very attractive. We noticed how thin the mattress was, and tried to find another one to fit, but could not due to the unconventional sizing.

Once our baby arrived, he refused to stay in it for long. We could not believe it - after 3 days, the thin mattress sagged and had a permanent sink in the middle. We tried padding with towels, to no avail. In desperation I finally bought a changing pad and cut to the size. The baby is now 1 month old and finds it a bit more comfortable.

All in all this is an okay product but they need to address the comfort issue.
 Its ok...Not what I pictured 07/19/2009 by Mommylevel2, Queens,NY 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
I just put together this bassinet myself (at 7 months pregnant, not too bad)..Its took me over an hour to assemble..The design looks plain..I was hoping for something more appealing..The features are somewhat useful..Its just a standard manual rocking bassinet..Its not bad for the price..My son isn&apos;t born yet so I don&apos;t know how he is going to enjoy it..but when he is I will write another review to help enlighten consumers on this product..I hope everyone will find my reviews to be helpftul..Thank you for time.....
 THIS BASSINET IS AWESOME!!!!!! 06/30/2009 by Simeona, Sanford,NC 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
This bassinet is the greatest ever. It&apos;s Huge! My son will be born in September and I am sure he&apos;s going to love it. It has everything you need to put it together. I did it myself in 45 minutes. It comes with the remote so you don&apos;t have to disturb the baby (buy 3 C batteries for mobile and 3 AAA batteries for the remote. It&apos;s just wonderful. i would recommend buying a bassinet pad for extra comfort. The sheet/mattress is kinda on the thin side but all the Days of Hunny baby gear is made that way. Otherwise it;s great so far. The matching Travel System is wonderful also. Just needs foam under the carseat cover for thickness.
 Only if you buy a thicker mattress 06/29/2009 by TJsMommyIllinois, Plainfield,IL 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
Our son would not sleep in the bassinet and we believe it&apos;s because the mattress that comes with it is too thin making it uncomfortable. We have used it as a changing station instead and it has worked well. It would be nice if the mobile lasted longer than 6 minutes (which is a great distraction for changing). I would have also liked an alternate stationary base. The rocker/rollers are more in the way when using it as a changing station.
 Excellent product!! 06/02/2009 by mommy2beround3, Ocala,to

Great bassinet very easy to put together. Love all the features. I think this product Is under priced. It&apos;s larger the most bassinets&amp;very sturdy. I would highly recommend this product if u have the space for it.
 Neither of my boys liked it. 05/15/2009 by LogannRileysmommy, Walker,Lousiana 
Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
The basinet was perfect when we bought it until we put my first son in it. The mattress is VERY thin and the basinet is larger than a standard one so it takes up more space and a mattress that you can buy from BabiesRUs wont fit. My first son didnt like to sleep in it and now 1 year later my youngest doesnt want to sleep in it either! For the price i regret buying it. Im hoping to get a different basinet soon (hopefully I can afford one instead of sleeping on my couch with the baby in his swing) that a thicker mattress will fit into. Im not worried about the space it takes up but it is larger than most basinets. It wasnt too hard to put together but I did get confused a few times.

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
This is a wonderful bassinet, and I love the adjustable height. My husband is very tall, and this is perfect. It is a lot bigger than most bassinets, and the weight limit exceeds alot of other bassinets as well. I love the fact that the color scheme is neutral. This was a last minute item, because the crib I wanted was sold out, and I have to wait until it is available. I have a week before the big day, but I know my son will love his new sleeping quarters. The padding is not as bad as I thought, but i did purchase a quilted pad to make it just right. The skirt padding exceeded my expectations, and the mobile is great.Thanks Walmart!!!!!

Comments about Disney Winnie the Pooh Bassinet with Adjustable Height :
This is a great product! I would strongly recommend this product to 1st time parents especially. It was so easy to put together.... my husband and I put it together in less than 30 minutes. The product comes along with all the tools, instructions and parts that you need except for AAA batteries and the C battery that you will need for the music mobile and remote. Both me and my husband are pretty tall so needless to say I am very pleased with the adjustable feature. The inside of the basket surprisingly is pretty long and wide. The price listed definitely matches the value of this product. Hope you will enjoy this product as much as we do!
