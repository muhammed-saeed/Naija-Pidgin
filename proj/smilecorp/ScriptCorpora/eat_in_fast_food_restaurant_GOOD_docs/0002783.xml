Hungry Girl,

If you were going with friends to one of the top five fast food places in America, what would you order? And at which one could you get the most volume and flavor for your calorie buck?

Fast Food Fever
 Dear Fast Food Fever,

 Excellent question! I love that I can go into practically ANY fast food restaurant and find something HG-friendly to eat. (Which means you can, too!) Truly... Any and every fast food chain restaurant has SOMETHING. Typically, I stick with chicken. I order whatever grilled chicken sandwich the place offers (sometimes two!), but with no sauce, condiments, or bun... just the chicken over some lettuce and tomato. Other times I&apos;ll order a grilled chicken salad (no cheese or croutons) plus an extra chicken breast on the side (or a garden salad with two chicken breasts on the side). If I want dressing, I stick with a low-fat or fat-free kind, read the packet nutritionals carefully, and usually only use about half the packet. As for the fast food place that offers the most flavor and volume for my calorie buck? That would have to be Burger King. BK has the best-tasting, juiciest chicken of them all! BTW, check out our full-on fast food survival guides from last year by clicking on these links: Burger King , McDonald&apos;s , Taco Bell , and Wendy&apos;s . Happy chewing!!!
