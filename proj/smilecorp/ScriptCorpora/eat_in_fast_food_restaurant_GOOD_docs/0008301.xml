 Dementia Has anyone had to deal with a parent with dementia? I was wondering if anyone has any good suggestions for helping me deal with this disease. I had to put my mom in a lodge as her dementia has gotten the better of her mind.The doctor strongly suggested that I get her into a care facility. They told me if she tries to escape from the the lodge then she will have to go into long term care. When I visit her she is doing well even playing the panio for the group and has made lots of new friends. She is also now eating properly and talking to people and seems mostly able to fit in. But around 8 p.m. she starts phoning me to come and get her as she wants to go home. The other night she called me long distance 10 times. When she never had a phone in her room she would bother other people to use their phone and call me collect. I have to disconnect my phone when I go to bed because she will call at 2 am and want to go home. I go to see her lots and explain why she needs care but she soon forgets. There is no doubt that she has to stay in a care facility but how to keep her there is the question. The other moring one of her friends who also lives in the lodge said my mother was losing it and she would hate to see her put into long term care. The question is what to do?

 So Sorry to Hear... My Mother had Dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s for the last 8-9 Yrs of her life..It is Probably the Worst Disease for the Person and the Family..We were able to Keep her in her Home she Lived in for 50 Yrs where she Raised Her Family. But as the Disease got Worse, She Always wanted to go&quot;Home&quot;which is where she Grew up..It is so Hard on the Family I cannot describe....She eventually Went further back in time and Referred to my Siblings as her Long Passed Siblings..I truly feel for you as her condition will worsen and you are Helpless to do anything but Watch...In the end I looked forward to her Passing as it was Cruel to watch her in this state and to have her not Know Me or anyone else around her..My advice to you is to Spend as much Time with her as Possible while she is still Vibrant and Lucid and Forgive her for Calling you..It&apos;s Heart Breaking but Turn your Phone off if it is disturbing you..The situation is Sad enough without causing yourself resentment..The Poor old Girl obviously is in a good place where she is being looked after and seems Happy if she&apos;s playing Piano..The Stimulation and Interaction with her Fellow Residents may help stave this Horrible Disease off a while longer and give her a little better quality of the remaining time she has with you...Once again, Be Patient with her. It&apos;s out of her and anyone&apos;s control..Good Luck.. __________________

 My grandfather sufferred with this. It was really tough on us all.

There was a secure care facility in Ponoka that was fantastic. It was just like a seniors lodge, but with the security needed to keep the folks there safe and sound.

If you are anywhere near Ponoka, I&apos;d seriously consider this. It&apos;s a new building with nice finishes and nice rooms. They really do look after them well there. __________________

 Start looking for a long care institution right now. Find a preferred place and get her on the waiting list.
Once you have her in long term care, you will feel better because she is being cared for by people specially trained for the disease. The doors are always locked and runners have alarms pinned on the back of their shirts.
As her health decreases you and the family will have access to special consultants and doctors that will keep you abreast of the day by day situation.

One word of caution: Do not let the staff get away with abuse of any sort with your mother. That requires that the family should visit often and raise total hexx if you see her suffering or at unease with anything.

I wish you and your family the best.

 My heart goes out you Artie. Our family went through the same thing with our mother.
It sounds like your mom is currently in an assisted living facility. As a previous poster said, your mom is in a good facility and she has good interaction with the residents playing piano etc.

You have to face the facts. The Doctor is already recommending a care facility. Im not sure what facilities are available at the current lodge, but some facilities have a secure care facility within the lodge. If your moms place has secure care thats the route I would go. Shes comfortable where she is and the last thing she and the family needs is relocation to another facility.

Unfortunately, many assisted living facilities are not equipped to care for residents that require more care as their physical or mental capabilities diminish. Often,the operators are eager to get these residents out and replace them with residents that require less care and attention. That means going to other facilities in different locations with no familiar friends or faces around anymore.

Many of these facilities are not new and fancy like the assisted living lodges where your mom currently lives. I was actually pretty shocked when I first went to the acute care facility where my mom got transferred too after spending some time in the hospital while she was living in assisted living.

After the initial shock, the first thing I realized that the place was a beehive of activity and interaction between residents, staff and family. The staff was always interacting with the residents with games activities and various therapies. A lot of the residents were in pretty rough shape. The staff and therapists were always respectful and got the residents involved no matter what limitations they had.

My mom actually enjoyed the last years of her life in acute care. She found living in the fancy assisted living facility rather boring and regimented. She said it was like living at an all inclusive resort. People living in acute care realize they are all in the same boat, they are they until the end and they tend to be more compassionate and genuinely care about one another.

There was a bit of a snob thing with some of the residents in the fancy places. Most of the residents have few bucks and they pay a few thousand a month for their monthly care. Some thought they were pretty special. Everyone was expected to get their hair done and to be all dressed up to go down to the dining room for meals. There were lots of conflicts with personalities and opinions. Women outnumber men about 8 to 1 and the old girls are always fighting over the new old guy They were generally served by staff that got paid minimum wage and many could not speak English. It was about as personal as going to a fast food restaurant and sitting with the same three people day in and day out. There was never really any personal care, activities or attention. Anybody that didnt fit in or get along was simply moved to another dining table. It was essentially warehousing people in a three or four star hotel, collecting the rent every month and moving them out as quickly as possible when health problems developed.
Your mom will eventually have to go into acute care from assisted living.

Your moms friend who would hate to see her go there is not part of the equation with the decision. What she tells you is playing with your head. When the time comes, spend lots of time at the potential facility and observe how people are being treated and cared for. Dont worry about the looks of the facility but pay lots of attention to the staff and how they interact with and treat the residents.

When she goes there, spend as much time with her as you can, visiting and taking her out if you can. I used to sometimes dread going to that place but I regularly did and if I still had a mom, Id be over there in a heartbeat.

Take Care

 My Dad died a little over a year ago (63 years old). He had a Parkinson-ism called MSA. The last few years of his life the dementia was pretty bad. It was really hard on Mom and us kids.

Some of the things he did were pretty hard to deal with at the time, but looking back now, we can laugh about them.

Once he lined up the purchase of $1.4 Million dollars worth of farm land. He was going to start farming again. I guess the realtor didn&apos;t realize that he wasn&apos;t all together upstairs. He talked to a local farm implements retailer and lined up some new tractors and various farming equipment. He even called up the owner of the local Safeway to line up a purchaser of the vegetables he was going to grow. Good thing Mom had already got the paper work done for Power of Attorney and Dad didn&apos;t have control of any of his money. It was a head ache at the time, and we had to call around to everyone and tell them that Dad was crazy and to stop the shipment on the new tractor. We laugh about it now!

We could see him going backwards in mental capacity. He would act like he was a young adult with all the energy to take over the world (without the physical capability), then he became a teenager: rebellious and hard headed. Then a child, and a toddler, throwing fits over every little thing. Soon he couldn&apos;t talk or communicate very well at all. Then he was relieved of his duties here on earth.

It&apos;s a tough battle. Be strong. I hope you can look back at it and enjoy the memories.

 Very similar to my experiance with Grandpa. At one time, he was passing around &apos;imaginary&apos; beers with square cans that he invented. They fit into a cooler much better that way apparantly.

It was hard to see a formidable man that I looked up to and admire to be reduced to a shell. He had cancer as well, and that is ultimately what took him. I was with him when he passed and honestly it was a relief for us all.

You have a tough road ahead of you, my suggestion is to seek the best care you can as it will relieve both your mom and the rest of the family of at least some of the hardships you&apos;ll face. __________________

 Right on both counts regarding your advice to start looking for long term care now (as it could take a year+ to get into a private room)..and be prepared to be an advocate. It is right to expect&quot;compassionate care&quot;, and do not stand for&quot;convenient care&quot;. Regarding the OP&apos;s issue with telephone calls...it is likely possible to&quot;block calls&quot;if it comes to that.... or arrange a phone with no long distance capability.
Get out the old photo albums when you go to visit, and you will have lots to talk about.

 Lots of good advice. This is probably not the place to go into details of your mother&apos;s health so I&apos;ll make a few general remarks. If her physical health is good, and it sounds like it is, she has friends, is providing a valuable service by playing the piano for the other residents, I&apos;d try to keep her&quot;aging in place&quot;as long as you can. The entrance to long term care is usually through the hospital emergency, and as you have read there is a big drop in independence.

As I understand it the biggest problem is the phone calls? Is that right?

There may be ways to deal with this where she is, eg. Mom they need you here to play the piano and visit with Mrs. so and so. Or maybe, I&apos;ll come on Saturday and we can go for a drive, any other humane way you can think of to help her with this terrible illness. With good nutrition and enough sleep (you note that when she is tired that these calls are more frequent) she may not deteriorate as quickly.
Does she get medication to help her sleep?
My $.02 is to try to keep her there where she is happy and has friends as long as you can.
Moving may cause more problems, and she may not like it at all.

You and your mother have our prayers.
Where do you live?

 My paternal grandfather had a short bout of dementia, before dying of cancer (though he had essentially estranged himself from the family); and my maternal grandmother is in the early stages. She gets a bit confused about things; has become verbally abusive with all of her children (although, fortunately, she is still somewhat well-mannered with at least some of her grandchildren); and occasionally forgets names (when I visited her at Christmas, she seemed to have lost track of which of her siblings had passed on, for example). I&apos;m not looking forward to the way that this is going to go.
Just to say, Artie, there are others who are in this boat with you. It&apos;s tough to see someone you love, gradually losing their faculties, especially when they&apos;re completely unaware of it (Grandma told me, the last time we spoke, that&quot;people think I&apos;m losing my marbles, but I&apos;ve still got all my marbles. They can&apos;t make me move into a home -- I&apos;m still all there!&quot;). I didn&apos;t cry until after I left.
As others have suggested, it may help your mom to feel that she is useful to someone, where she is. But in terms of answers to the big picture, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m as uncertain as you are. __________________

 I would talk to the Canadian Altzheimers Society

 http://www.alzheimer.ca/en/We-can-help 

They will likely have a suport group in your area. It is always good to speak to those who have walked or are walking the same road with dementia.

Besides giving moral support they provide a lot of info about the disease, how to access supports, funding etc

 My Parents dealt with this for a few years with my Grandmother. She would seem fine one day,the next she was calling at all hours making no sense. I think the record for phone calls was in excess of 40 calls one night before they unplugged the phone.

They would be called names one minute, the next minute she was fine. As time wore on, she forgot who some of the Grandkids were at times and even her own son. She would also ask to see her daughter who had died about 25 years earlier. My Mother would tell me that for a little old lady who only weighed about 90lbs. that she was incredibly strong. She would sometimes need to be restrained which took a lot of effort.

My Father went to see her one day and she was laying in the hallway in her own feces with a broken hip. Apparently she had been there for some time without receiving any help. I would hate to see how I&apos;d react if I found my Mother in that state. Get her into a respectable facility if you can afford it. Dementia is one Bitch of a Disease and the whole family is afflicted. If you have Children,definitely pick the good times for them to see their Grandparent.

The person with Dementia will get to a point that they will not remember all the time and effort that you spend with them. It can take a very long time for a person with Dementia to pass. Don&apos;t allow the Disease to ruin any more than 1 life. __________________
