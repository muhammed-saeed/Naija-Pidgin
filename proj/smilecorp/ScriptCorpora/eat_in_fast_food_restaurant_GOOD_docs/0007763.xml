 Flag Close Post a comment If you like hamburgers and you also like hot dogs, then you will love a hamburger hot dog! Hamburger hot dogs are a nice twist on the classic hot dog. It&apos;s a hot dog but made with hamburger meat. Hamburger hot dogs can be made on the stove, in the oven or on the grill. No matter how you decide to cook them, your family and guests will devour them!
 What you need: 
ground beef
hot dog buns
condiments

Take your ground beef and instead of making patties, form the meat into the shape of a hot dog. Make hamburger wieners! But make the hamburger wieners larger than a typical hot dog because they will shrink up a bit during cooking. And you want them to fill the hot dog roll.

Cook your hamburger wieners any way you like. If you cook them on the stove top, simply heat them in any frying pan just as you would a hamburger patty. But turn them on all side to cook evenly. If you want, you can put all the hamburger wieners on a cookie sheet and put them under the broiler (great for a large batch) and turn several times. Or you can put them on the grill! If you cook them on the grill, just be careful turning them so they do not break.

Put your hamburger wieners in the hot dog buns and spiff them up with the condiments of your choice. If you normally use sweet relish on your hot dogs, you may want to try dill relish on your hamburger hot dogs. It&apos;s still relish but it give the flavor of the dill pickle you normally have on a hamburger. Catsup and mustard are also good choices. And don&apos;t forget the chopped onion!

If you would like a cheeseburger hot dog, simply place a slice of American cheese on the roll then put the hot hamburger wiener on top of the cheese. It will melt from the heat of the meat. You can also toast your hot dog buns if you like.
