		Two Guys go Transcontinental
(... in a single engine, two seat airplane) 

        Article by Ken 
Graham 

 Ray Sluk is the kind of guy that 
if you dont talk with him for three years or more, youre still reconnected in 
the first thirty seconds. Hed been my academic advisee while I was a young 
business school faculty member at Penn State in the late 70s. Id learned to 
fly at age 20. When I knew Ray at Penn State, he was working on his now 200 
skydiving jumps. On his first airplane ride, he left the plane in midair. It was 
his 26th airplane ride that gave him his first experience of an airplane 
LANDING!

Ray Sluk retired at age 48 from FEDEX as VP for Latin America earlier in this 
decade. By December 2004, he had his ASEL private license. After hearing about 
my flying the Canadian North as a renter pilot in 2004, we planned the 2005 
flight through Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon, Alaska, and the Canadian 
North West Territory. By May 2006, hed added instrument, commercial, and CFI. 
After our May 06 adventure, he added commercial ASES, bought a good chunk of 
the flight school that launched him into flying, then proceed to increase its 
revenue 700% in 15 months. The guy cant do things in a modest way.

So the May 2006 adventure was instigated by Ray. Why fly transcontinental in a 
Diamond 20? Because few people would do it, and it needed to be done, we 
thought. Ray had placed two Diamond 20s into Falcon Aviation in his now 
hometown of Peachtree City, Georgia. Wed used N346MA for earlier adventures. It 
was time to go the distance.

 Atlanta to Kitty Hawk, NC, then Fly West!
 
Wed started from KFFC (does that identifier seem like a fast food restaurant?), 
his home base and flew east to begin the westbound transcontinental journey from 
First Flight Airport, Kitty Hawk, NC. And since First Flight has no fuel, we 
needed to stop east of Charlotte to continue east, visit the Wright Brothers 
monument, and start west. First days itinerary was essentially Atlanta to Kitty 
Hawk to Nashville, where Rays second daughter, Jenna, a new manager for FedEX, 
would put us up for the night.

It was a delightful run on Rays leg from FFC to First Flight. We took each 
others pictures at the Wright Brothers monument. No time for sentiment, I took 
us off for Nashville.

Cruising along at 10,500, we could see weather over the Great Smoky Mountains. 
Id flown in IMC with Ray before, even at night, but didnt appreciate what we 
were hearing on the radio. Two pilots in two separate aircraft, with great 
urgency in their voices, reported ice buildup on the wings of their airplanes. 
Each pilot was begging controllers for lower altitudes. Minimums in the area 
approach 7,000, so controllers were delaying some let-downs.

We seemed ok for a time. Eventually, the wingtips started to disappear in the 
dense clouds. We had heat switched on for the pitot. Then I noticed a 600 to 800 
foot swing in reported altitude. The ice on the leading edge, just above where 
the pitot begins, was picking up some pitot heat, causing water to run down the 
pitot tube.

A Diamond pitot tube doesnt protrude forward as it does on a Cessna, for 
example. On a Diamond, the air inlet is a hole drilled into the front edge of a 
pitot sticking straight down. Evidentially the water would momentarily cover the 
hole in the pitot, causing the long altimeter needle to swing.

We proposed a southbound swing to get lower minimums, got clearance, and 
descended into the soup on a deviated course for Nashville. Enough of my first 
icing experience. Ice makes the plane sluggish as youd expect.

Jenna met us at the small airport closest to Opryland. The guy fueling planes 
that evening had a very understated sense of humor. I asked him what the fuel 
price was as I took the static ground line from his truck. 100LL is $4.10 a 
gallon if I do it, and $5.10 a gallon if you help!!

Our launch at dawn only required using a towel to take the moisture off the 
wings. Up and headed for Memphis.

Memphis is the primary hub for FedEX, and is also headquarters. Ray knows people 
there. One of them was helping Ray get another planes battery recharged after 
hours several months earlier. The mechanic actually doing the work stayed 
through his own dinner time to get the job done, and charged very modestly for 
his employer. Ray asked his FedEX friend to tip the mechanic generously.

Ray knew his friend can be parsimonious (read cheap). We stopped at the Memphis 
satellite airport where this earlier tipping opportunity had happened. Ray found 
the mechanic, reminded him of his good deeds, and gave the mechanic the added 
money Ray felt his friend should have given. We left there with one surprised, 
grateful A&amp;P waving goodbye.

Our route of flight was now to be over northern Louisiana and northern Texas. We 
decided to stop in Graham, Texas, for pictures, then in Olney, Texas, for gas. 
Olney is the home of the Air Tractor crop spray airplane factory. It is also 
known for having perhaps the lowest fuel price for 200 miles. We pressed on.

Our goal for the night was reached before sunset. Wed called ahead to reserve 
the courtesy car at Slayton, Texas, 30 miles southeast of Lubbock. Land, buy 
gas, (we always do this on arrival so that parking fees disappearit works), and 
as employees were closing the doors we asked for the van. It is the ancient GMC 
van next to the building. Keys are in it. Youll find one restaurant in 
townMexicanwith great food. Please do not lock the van, and do leave the keys 
in it all night. Were working hard to get it stolen, but havent been 
successful!!! The van had great character (like its owner), and more than of 
a million miles on it.

Our launch from Slayton the next morning was into cool, clear air. Direction was 
Albuquerque. We chose Sandia AirPark as the first fuel stop. With only 45 wide 
paved runway, this is a public use residential airpark with great gas prices and 
superb service. It also has an internet video camera that broadcasts live to the 
internet.

As we fueled 346MA, Rays cell phone began to ring. Someone in his flight school 
in Georgia wondered where we were. Wed been filing IFR flight plans. Theyd 
tracked us to Sandia (watermelon in Spanish) on www.flightaware.com Then they 
discovered the live webcam, and spotted the plane. Reminded us of the old saying 
You can run but you cant hide.

First real mountain flying begins here. Departure westbound with terrain 
minimums approaching 6000 feet in places. Id remembered having New Mexico 
flight planning on my Private written exam way back when. Id also taken the 
Texas Civil Air Patrol Mountain Flying Clinic nearby in Alpine, Texas, six years 
earlier. One basic rule is to never cross a saddle without a 2000 foot minimum 
clearance. Air drainage you cant see and high sink rates can overpower the 
climb ability of the aircraft. Always have an altitude cushion.

Ive come to enjoy the Diamond 20 a great deal. It burns 5.5 gph and produces 
115 hp. My Cessna 150 burns 5gph, as does my 912ULS powered Savannah. The 
Savannah gets only 85 mph because of STOL slats on the leading edge. The 150 
does 95 before hoped-for tailwind.

But the Diamond 20 easily gets 140 mph, sometimes more in still air. My Cessna 
is giving me 16 miles per gallon. Rays Diamond often gives 21 miles per gallon. 
Guess streamlining does pay off.

Our next gas stop was also for lunch. We chose Sedona, Arizona, and the airport 
sits atop a bluff. On final youre 600 feet off the ground until nearly the 
threshold. Wind can be hard to predict. Plus the place has an atmosphere of 
money, meaning lots of people fly their own planes there. Great place to visit, 
and to eat outside.

Our stop for the night was in Bullhead City, AZ. We stopped early in part 
because of the 100 degree temperature on the ground. And this was before May 20! 
The blast furnace was really on.

The following day was to take us to Oceanside, California. Wed prepared for the 
complex airspace of the LA basin by buying both VFR charts and the Terminal Area 
Chart.

About 25 miles from Oceanside it became clear that ground fog was not lifting, 
and that no operations were occurring there. We declared victory, and diverted 
northbound. We stopped just over the Angeles mountains from the LA basin (in 
part to avoid smog) to gas, eat, and go. Time to plan and execute the next 
phase.

When Ray and I planned this trip, we decided that the return would include some 
stops each of us wanted to see. I liked Death Valley, Bryce Canyon National 
Park, and Jackson Hole, WY. Ray wanted to stay in the area of Mount Rushmore. We 
filed for northeast departure, terminating at a Las Vegas satellite airport.

Approaching the aptly named Furnace Creek Airport in Death Valley, we wanted to 
land and see the altimeter go negative by about 250 feet. But on final we 
noticed the outside air temp was 105, so we elected touch and go operations so 
that each of us could experience the air made dense by altitude, them made 
lighter by heat! With plenty of gas, we headed for the planned stop near Vegas.

As we approached Las Vegas Class B, Ray cancelled our Flight Following with 
Flight Service, saying wed move on to Mesquite, NV, as a fuel stop, then into 
Utah. Over Henderson, NV, (south of McCarren Airport but under its layer cake, 
we were squawking unique and talking to controllers. A huge updraft took me by 
surprise, and we busted the Class B ceiling by about 200 feet. We descended 
immediately. Nothing was said on the radio by controllers.

While getting gas at Mesquite, I went to use the facility. As I passed the FBO 
desk, the phone rang, and was promptly answered by and old fashioned answering 
machine. I heard the FAA ask the FBO to call a certain number.

When I told Ray, he thought it would be about airspace. But the FAA had us 
overdue at our stop originally filed on our VFR flight plan. FSS hadnt 
communicated to the controllers. The search had begun by phone. We immediately 
reported in by phone to the controllers to avoid the launch of a full search and 
rescue operation. It is ironic that this incident occurred within miles of the 
actual search area for adventurer Steve Fossett, who was lost on a clear 
Saturday morning a year and 3+ months later. (Note: As of 2 October 2008, Steve 
Fossetts pilots license and aircraft wreckage were found in a very vertical 
area near Mammoth Lakes, California. No remains have been found. Authorities say 
the crash site suggests a crash that could not have been survived.)

Daylight permitted us to fly to Cedar City, UT, for the night. We rented a car 
and were able to visit Bryce Canyon National Park, with its hoodoos, the 
colorful rock formations formed by erosion. Spectacular. We also visited their 
airport, but at nearly 7000 feet field elevation, it requires careful flight 
operations. I was to land there in April of 2008 on another adventure.

The following morning our first leg was to Spanish Forks, UT. Arriving from the 
south, we noticed that mountains limit the arrival approaches. We also heard 11 
different aircraft calling traffic on CTAF!! Spanish Forks is a major flight 
school destination for rotary pilots. And current oil prices guarantee the 
demand for rotary pilots to fly to offshore platforms. Landing and take off were 
very busy, but courteous.

We got flight following for Twin Falls, ID, and changed our request in route for 
Jackson Hole. Cumulus with sunshine let us see Grand Teton Peaks above the 
general terrain. Cumulus in the Snake River Gorge meant we had to fly very 
careful VFR to arrive at Jackson Hole via the back door.

Jackson Hole is a hoot. Lots of private jets and other fancy aircraft use the 
airport. Setting is amazingly beautiful. FBO guys know Harrison Ford, the local 
rancher, movie actor, and multiple aircraft owner. Ray and I talked with FBO 
employees about how Harrison Ford bent his own helicopter. We had lunch, paid 
dearly for 100LL, and headed for Mount Rushmore via the hot springs at 
Thermopolis, Wyoming, and Devils Tower in extreme northeast Wyoming. Id landed 
nearby on an earlier trip out west solo.

Devils Tower appears on the current version of Wyoming license plates. It is 
several hundred feet high, and at least 300 feet across its nearly flat top. 
Though Im sure the rock climbers love its challenges, perhaps 40 years ago 
there was another drama. A parachutist landed atop the tower, was unable to 
climb down, and had to be rescued by helicopter, and had to pay for the rescue. 
Devils Tower is no longer a skydivers target.

We landed at the Custer, SD, airport. No courtesy car, but we arranged pickup by 
a couple who ran the motel we chose. Their kindness was great. They talked a car 
dealer into renting a car to us. The following morning, a Saturday, we drove to 
Mount Rushmore so that Ray could enjoy his first visit there. He needed to 
understand the setting, the size, the motivation for its creation.

We returned to Custer, where Ray gave a demo ride in the Diamond to one of the 
motel managers. I then had the job of finding Mount Rushmore from the air, then 
using slow flight techniques from right to left across the faces while Ray 
captured digital pictures. What a great morning, and what a great set of 
pictures from a perspective tourists dont get to see.

Touch and go a Wall, SD, airport to honor an amazing business story. In 1934 a 
young just-graduated pharmacist named Bull Husted married his sweetheart Emily, 
and bought a run down pharmacy on a note. The two were so poor that they slept 
on the floor in the back room of the pharmacy. They were behind on note 
payments. The 150 people of Wall had some pharmacy needs, but no money. It was 
the depression. Wall had only one asset. It sat beside a U.S. highway that led 
across the country. Some people actually drove to Yellowstone National Park. 
They could see no reason to stop in Wall.

One Sunday in 1936, Emily put up two signs next to the highway, one on each side 
of town. They said simply Free Ice WaterWall Drug. Cars began to come to the 
pharmacy that day. Ten years later, Emily would SELL bumper stickers to the same 
motorists that advertised Wall Drug!! Ive personally seen these bumper stickers 
in Oregon and in New England. Wall Drug became a destination. Today it is a 
multi-multi million dollar business run by their son Ted. It carries a product 
mix that can be described as unique. Ever seen a stuffed jack rabbit with 
antelope horns? Theyre for sale right there! It still fills prescriptions, and 
has a soda fountain.

Wall Drug was founded on desperation and initiative. Sell the concept of a 
destination. Give something away that is valued but inexpensive. And have your 
customers provide no cost advertising for you. What are the similar inspirations 
for our businesses?

Our gas stop was Wiley, SD. Wind was so strong that I opted for the turf strip 
into the wind. Got a little mud on the tires from the previous nights rain. 
Taxied up to the pump. Pump worked, but no card reader. A sign said, Pump your 
fuel, leave your credit card number on a slip of paper and put it on my desk. 
Leave your N number, and Ill look you up and send you a receipt. Talk about 
the honor system!

South Dakota leads to Iowa when youre headed to the Illinois. At our next fuel 
stop, Ray, with his new CFI credential, had me doing spot landings. His plane, 
so of course he can do them. But Diamonds float and float and float on landing. 
At least I got better.

We needed an overnight at the end of this day. I keep a car in a hangar 200 
miles west of my suburban Chicago home. Why? Because I have some land and a 
retreat in the woods on a private airstrip out there. My Cessna 150 was closer 
to my home, so the western IL hangar only had the car. We hangared Rays plane, 
and stayed overnight in town, sharing my wifi enabled computer (on which Im 
writing this) so that we can both run our consulting businesses as we do each 
night while traveling cross-country in the lower 48. (It was a little hard to 
find wifi above the Arctic Circle the prior year!)

The following day Ray dropped me off at my car, which was waiting at the 
Bloomington, IL, airport. Id flown commercially to Atlanta to start this 
adventure. Ray detoured to Pittsburgh for a family visit, then returned to 
Peachtree Citys Falcon Field.

Our trip took exactly a week. Wed effectively flown transcontinental both ways. 
Wed been in 15 states. Wed been iced, spotted on the internet, roasted over 
100 degrees in May, fogged out of our destination, roasted again in Death 
Valley, sought by the FAA, visited national parks and monuments, seen a glimpse 
of the high life of Jackson Hole, trusted for our payment for fuel, and 
generally been treated in the very trusting way that aviation tends to provide. 
Great learning, great log book entries. Heavy cost for fuel. Memoriespriceless.
