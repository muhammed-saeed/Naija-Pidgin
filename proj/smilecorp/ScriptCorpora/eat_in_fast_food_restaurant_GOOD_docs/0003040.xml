There are three major versions of the hypothesis: \&quot;weak\&quot;, \&quot;semi-strong\&quot;, and \&quot;strong\&quot;. Weak EMH claims that prices on traded assets already reflect all past publicly available information.

Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory of investment which attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets. Although MPT is widely used in practice in the financial industry and several of its creators won a Nobel prize for the theory, in recent years the basic assumptions of MPT have been widely challenged by fields such as behavioral economics.(

A hedge fund is an investment fund open to a limited range of investors that undertakes a wider range of investment and trading activities than traditional long-only investment funds, and that, in general, pays a performance fee to its investment manager. Every hedge fund has its own investment strategy that determines the type of investments and the methods of investment it undertakes. Hedge funds, as a class, invest in a broad range of investments including shares, debt and commodities.

In finance, a forward contract or simply a forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed today. This is in contrast to a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset today. It costs nothing to enter a forward contract. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position.
~
A \&quot;fund of funds\&quot; (FOF) is an investment strategy of holding a portfolio of other investment funds rather than investing directly in shares, bonds or other securities. This type of investing is often referred to as multi-manager investment. There are different types of &apos;fund of funds&apos;, each investing in a different type of collective investment scheme (typically one type per FoF), eg. &apos;mutual fund&apos; FoF, hedge fund FoF, private equity FoF or investment trust FoF.

Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis.

The foreign exchange market (forex, FX, or currency market) is a worldwide decentralized over-the-counter financial market for the trading of currencies. Financial centers around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of different types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market determines the relative values of different currencies.

A market trend is a putative tendency of a financial market to move in a particular direction over time. These trends are classified as secular trends for long time frames, primary trends for medium time frames, and secondary trends lasting short times. Traders identify market trends using technical analysis, a framework which characterizes market trends as a predictable price response of the market at levels of price support and price resistance, varying over time.
~
, algorithmic trading or automated trading, also known as algo trading, black-box trading or robo trading, is the use of computer programmes for entering trading orders with the computer algorithm deciding on aspects of the order such as the timing, price, or quantity of the order, or in many cases initiating the order without human intervention. Algorithmic Trading is widely used by pension funds, mutual funds, and other buy side (investor driven) institutional traders, to divide large trades into several smaller trades in order to manage market impact, and risk.
~
, stock valuation is the method of calculating theoretical values of companies and their stocks. The main use of these methods is to predict future market prices, or more generally potential market prices, and thus to profit from price movement – stocks that are judged undervalued (with respect to their theoretical value) are bought, while stocks that are judged overvalued are sold, in the expectation that undervalued stocks will, on the whole, rise in value, while overvalued stocks will, on the whole, fall.
~
, a high-yield bond (non-investment-grade bond, speculative-grade bond, or junk bond) is a bond that is rated below investment grade at the time of purchase. These bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events, but typically pay higher yields than better quality bonds in order to make them attractive to investors.
~
The Sharpe ratio or Sharpe index or Sharpe measure or reward-to-variability ratio is a measure of the excess return per unit of risk in an investment asset or a trading strategy, named after William Forsyth Sharpe. Since its revision by the original author in 1994, it is defined as: where is the asset return, is the return on a benchmark asset, such as the risk free rate of return, is the expected value of the excess of the asset return over the benchmark return, and is the standard deviation of the asset.

A market maker is a company, or an individual, that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid-offer spread, or turn.
~
, the Beta (β) of a stock or portfolio is a number describing the relation of its returns with that of the financial market as a whole. An asset with a beta of 0 means that its returns change independently of changes in the market&apos;s returns. A positive beta means that the asset&apos;s returns generally follow the market&apos;s returns, in the sense that they both tend to be above their respective averages together, or both tend to be below their respective averages together.
~
Risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a risk-based profitability measurement framework for analysing risk-adjusted financial performance and providing a consistent view of profitability across businesses. The concept was developed by Bankers Trust, principal designer Dan Borge currently a Director at the expert firm LECG-SMART, in the late 1970s. Note, however, that more and more Return on risk Adjusted Capital (RORAC) is used as a measure, whereby the risk adjustment of Capital is based on the capital adequacy guidelines as outlined by the Basel Committee, currently Basel II.

, a warrant is a security that entitles the holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a fixed exercise price until the expiry date. Warrants and options are similar in that the two contractual financial instruments allow the holder special rights to buy securities. Both are discretionary and have expiration dates. The word warrant simply means to \&quot;endow with the right\&quot;, which is only slightly different to the meaning of an option.

In finance, a swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange certain benefits of one party&apos;s financial instrument for those of the other party&apos;s financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic interest (or coupon) payments associated with the bonds.
~
, a financial market is a mechanism that allows people to buy and sell financial securities (such as stocks and bonds), commodities (such as precious metals or agricultural goods), and other fungible items of value at low transaction costs and at prices that reflect the efficient-market hypothesis.

The NASDAQ Stock Market, also known as the NASDAQ, is an American stock exchange. \&quot;NASDAQ\&quot; originally stood for \&quot;National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations,\&quot; but the exchange&apos;s official stance is that the acronym is obsolete. It is the largest electronic screen-based equity securities trading market in the United States and fourth largest by market capitalization in the world.
~
Alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of the so-called active return on an investment. It is the return in excess of the compensation for the risk borne, and thus commonly used to assess active managers&apos; performances. Often, the return of a benchmark is subtracted in order to consider relative performance, which yields Jensen&apos;s alpha. The alpha coefficient is a parameter in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
~
A mutual fund is a professionally managed type of collective investment scheme that pools money from many investors and invests typically in investment securities. The mutual fund will have a fund manager that trades (buys and sells) the fund&apos;s investments in accordance with the fund&apos;s investment objective. In the U.S. , a fund registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under both SEC and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules must distribute nearly all of its net income and net realized gains from the sale of securities (if any) to its investors at least annually.
~
The derivatives market is the financial market for derivatives, financial instruments like futures contracts or options, which are derived from other forms of assets. The market can be divided into two, that for exchange-traded derivatives and that for over-the-counter derivatives.

~
, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, if that asset is to be added to an already well-diversified portfolio, given that asset&apos;s non-diversifiable risk. The model takes into account the asset&apos;s sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk, often represented by the quantity beta (β) in the financial industry, as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset.
~
The P/E ratio (price-to-earnings ratio) of a stock (also called its \&quot;P/E\&quot;, or simply \&quot;multiple\&quot;) is a measure of the price paid for a share relative to the annual net income or profit earned by the firm per share. Unlike EV/EBITDA multiple, P/E reflects the capital structure of the company in question. P/E is a financial ratio used for valuation: a higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying more for each unit of net income, so the stock is more expensive compared to one with lower P/E ratio.
~
A broker-dealer is a term used in United States financial services regulations. It is a company or other organization that trades securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers. Although many broker-dealers are \&quot;independent\&quot; firms solely involved in broker-dealer services, many others are business units or subsidiaries of commercial banks, investment banks or investment companies. When executing trade orders on behalf of a customer, the institution is said to be acting as a broker.
~
Securitization is a structured finance process that distributes risk by aggregating assets in a pool (often by selling assets to a special purpose entity), then issuing new securities backed by the assets and their cash flows. The securities are sold to investors who share the risk and reward from those assets. Securitization is similar to a sale of a profitable business (\&quot;spinning off\&quot;) into a separate entity.

~
An electronic communication network (ECN) is the term used in financial circles for a type of computer system that facilitates trading of financial products outside of stock exchanges. The primary products that are traded on ECNs are stocks and currencies. ECNs came into existence in 1998 when the SEC authorized their creation. ECNs increase competition among trading firms by lowering transaction costs, giving clients full access to their order books, and offering order matching outside of traditional exchange hours.

Commodity markets are markets where raw or primary products are exchanged. These raw commodities are traded on regulated commodities exchanges, in which they are bought and sold in standardized contracts. This article focuses on the history and current debates regarding global commodity markets. It covers physical product (food, metals, electricity) markets but not the ways that services, including those of governments, nor investment, nor debt, can be seen as a commodity.

~
, book value or carrying value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account balance. For assets, the value is based on the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs made against the asset. Traditionally, a company&apos;s book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. However, in practice, depending on the source of the calculation, book value may variably include goodwill, intangible assets, or both.
~
Return on capital (ROC) is a ratio used in finance, valuation, and accounting. The ratio is estimated by dividing the after-tax operating income by the book value of invested capital.

, growth stocks are stocks of companies that have historically achieved measurable growth traits, particularly characterized by strong earnings growth and high profitability ratios.
~
Market timing is the strategy of making buy or sell decisions of financial assets by attempting to predict future market price movements. The prediction may be based on an outlook of market or economic conditions resulting from technical or fundamental analysis. This is an investment strategy based on the outlook for an aggregate market, rather than for a particular financial asset.

A flight-to-quality is a stock market phenomenon occurring when investors sell what they perceive to be higher-risk investments and purchase safer investments, such as US Treasuries, gold or land. This is considered a sign of fear in the marketplace, as investors seek less risk in exchange for lower profits. This also is the increased demand for assets that are government-backed, while is also a decline in private asset demands.m 
~
A financial ratio (or accounting ratio) is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise&apos;s financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization.

~
, a bond option is an OTC-traded financial instrument that facilitates an option to buy or sell a particular bond at a certain date for a particular price. It is similar to a stock option with the difference that the underlying asset is a bond. Bond options can be valued using the Black model or with a lattice based short rate model such as Black-Derman-Toy, Ho Lee or Hull–White. The present market value for the bond is referred to as the spot price while the future value as per the option is referred to as the strike price.
~
Stock dilution is a general term that results from the issue of additional common shares by a company. This increase in common shares of a stock can result from a secondary market offering, employees exercising stock options, or by conversion of convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This dilution can shift fundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control, earnings per share, or the value of individual shares.
~
An angel investor or angel (also known as a business angel or informal investor) is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. A small but increasing number of angel investors organize themselves into angel groups or angel networks to share research and pool their investment capital.

The pairs trade or pair trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sidewise movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy. The pair trading was pioneered by Nunzio Tartaglia’s quantitative group at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. The main assumption of the strategy is that certain two securities, often competitors in the same sector, are correlated in their day-to-day price movements.: 
~
Buy and hold is a long term investment strategy based on the view that in the long run financial markets give a good rate of return despite periods of volatility or decline. This viewpoint also holds that short term market timing, i.e. the concept that one can enter the market on the lows and sell on the highs, does not work for small, or unsophisticated, investors so it is better to simply buy and hold.
~
Shares outstanding are common shares that have been authorized, issued, and purchased by investors. They have voting rights and represent ownership in the corporation by the person or institution that holds the shares. They should be distinguished from treasury shares, which is common stock held by the corporation. Shares outstanding can be calculated as either basic or fully diluted. The fully diluted shares outstanding count includes diluting securities as options, warrants or convertibles.
~
The price-to-book ratio, or P/B ratio, is a financial ratio used to compare a company&apos;s book value to its current market price. Book value is an accounting term denoting the portion of the company held by the shareholders; in other words, the company&apos;s total tangible assets less its total liabilities. The calculation can be performed in two ways, but the result should be the same each way. In the first way, the company&apos;s market capitalization can be divided by the company&apos;s total book value from its balance sheet.
~
, a trading strategy is a predefined set of rules for making trading decisions. Traders, investment firms and fund managers use a trading strategy to help make wiser investment decisions and help eliminate the emotional aspect of trading. A trading strategy is governed by a set of rules that do not deviate. Emotional bias is eliminated because the systems operate within the parameters known by the trader.
~
In finance, momentum is the empirically observed tendency for rising asset prices to rise further. For instance, it was shown that stocks with strong past performance continue to outperform stocks with poor past performance in the next period with an average excess return of about 1% per month (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993, 1999). The existence of momentum is a market anomaly, which finance theory has been struggling to explain.
~
, the free float of a company is defined as those shares that are readily available for trading. The concept of free float is particularly important for assigning a weight to a listed company in the calculation of an index
~
A put option (usually just called a \&quot;put\&quot;) is a financial contract between two parties, the writer (seller) and the buyer of the option. The buyer acquires a short position by purchasing the right to sell the underlying instrument to the seller of the option for a specified price during a specified period of time. If the option buyer exercises their right, the seller is obligated to buy the underlying instrument from them at the agreed upon strike price, regardless of the current market price.
~
Short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock. Short squeezes result when short sellers cover their positions on a stock. This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility.
~
A floor trader is a member of a stock or commodities exchange who trades on the floor of that exchange for his or her own account. The floor trader must abide by trading rules similar to those of the exchange specialists who trade on behalf of others. The term should not be confused with floor broker. Floor Traders are occasionally referred to as Registered Competitive Traders, Individual Liquidity Providers or locals.
~
A stock split or stock divide increases the number of shares in a public company. The price is adjusted such that the before and after market capitalization of the company remains the same and dilution does not occur. Options and warrants are included.
~
A treasury stock or reacquired stock is stock which is bought back by the issuing company, reducing the amount of outstanding stock on the open market (\&quot;open market\&quot; including insiders&apos; holdings). Stock repurchases are often used as a tax-efficient method to put cash into shareholders&apos; hands, rather than pay dividends. Sometimes, companies do this when they feel that their stock is undervalued on the open market.
~
EV/EBITDA is a valuation multiple that is often used in parallel with, or as an alternative to, the P/E ratio. An advantage of this multiple is that it is capital structure-neutral. Therefore, this multiple can be used for direct cross-companies application. A drawback of this multiple is that it ignores profitability, which is usually considered a critical value driver. In this respect, the EV/EBITDA multiple requires prudent use for companies with low profit margins, resulting in artificially high multiples.v 
~
Mean reversion is a mathematical concept sometimes used for stock investing, but it can be applied to other assets. In general terms, the essence of the concept is the assumption that both a stock&apos;s high and low prices are temporary and that a stock&apos;s price will tend to move to the average price over time. Mean reversion involves first identifying the trading range for a stock, and then computing the average price using analytical techniques as it relates to assets, earnings, etc.
~
The debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is a financial ratio indicating the relative proportion of shareholders&apos; equity and debt used to finance a company&apos;s assets. Closely related to leveraging, the ratio is also known as Risk, Gearing or Leverage. The two components are often taken from the firm&apos;s balance sheet or statement of financial position, but the ratio may also be calculated using market values for both, if the company&apos;s debt and equity are publicly traded, or using a combination of book value for debt and market value for equity financially.
~
Return on equity (ROE) measures the rate of return on the ownership interest of the common stock owners. It measures a firm&apos;s efficiency at generating profits from every unit of shareholders&apos; equity (also known as net assets or assets minus liabilities). ROE shows how well a company uses investment funds to generate earnings growth.
~
The PEG ratio is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share, and the company&apos;s expected growth. In general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth rates.
~
s as well as other financial instruments, slippage is the difference between estimated transaction costs and the amount actually paid. Brokers may not always be effective enough at executing orders. Market-impacted, liquidity, and frictional costs may also contribute. Algorithmic trading is often used to reduce slippage.
~
A call option, often simply labeled a \&quot;call\&quot;, is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller of this type of option. The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price. The seller (or \&quot;writer\&quot;) is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide.
~
, a trade is an exchange of a security for \&quot;cash\&quot;, typically a short-dated promise to pay in the currency of the country where the &apos;exchange&apos; is located. Trading implies attempting to profit from short-term fluctuations in a security&apos;s price as opposed to buying it for use or for income via methods such as dividends or interest. Trading is similar to speculation and investing, but differs in that the position in the security is intended to be held for a very short time, generally less than a week; however &apos;trades&apos; are used to implement any investing strategy.
~
A floor broker is an independent member of an exchange who can act as a broker for other members who become overloaded with orders, as an agent on the floor of the exchange. The floor broker receives an order via teletype machine from his firm&apos;s trading department and then proceeds to the appropriate trading post on the exchange floor. There he joins other brokers and the specialist in the security being bought or sold and executes the trade at the best competitive price available.
~
in standard financial markets is often openly advertised in order to attract additional liquidity to that venue and is usually done in real time by publishing market depth. However, dark liquidity by definition cannot be seen by any potential market participant and its existence can be imputed only ex post facto. Dark liquidity is generally used to try to reduce market impact when trading large orders.
~
, equity is the residual claim or interest of the most junior class of investors in assets, after all liabilities are paid. If valuations placed on assets do not exceed liabilities, negative equity exists. In an accounting context, Shareholders&apos; equity (or stockholders&apos; equity, shareholders&apos; funds, shareholders&apos; capital or similar terms) represents the remaining interest in assets of a company, spread among individual shareholders of common or preferred stock.
~
The uptick rule refers to a trading restriction that disallows short selling of securities except on an uptick. For the rule to be satisfied, the short must be either at a price above the last traded price of the security, or at the last traded price if that price was higher than the price in the previous trade. The rule was defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which summarized it: \&quot;Rule 10a-1(a)(1) provided that, subject to certain exceptions, a listed security may be sold short (A) at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected (plus tick), or (B) at the last sale price if it is higher than the last different price (zero-plus tick).
~
Earnings yield is the quotient of earnings per share divided by the share price. It is the reciprocal of the P/E ratio. The earnings yield is quoted as a percentage, allowing an easy comparison to going bond rates.
~
Swing trading is commonly defined as a speculative activity in financial markets whereby instruments such as stocks, indexes, bonds, currencies, or commodities are repeatedly bought or sold at or near the end of up or down price swings caused by price volatility. A swing trading position is typically held longer than a day, but shorter than trend following trades or buy and hold investment strategies that can be held for weeks or months.
~
Mosaic theory, also referred to more colloquially as the scuttlebutt method by Philip Fisher in his seminal work Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, in finance is the method used in security analysis to gather information about a corporation. Mosaic theory involves collecting information from different sources, public and private, to calculate the value of security. Applying the mosaic theory is as much art as it is science.
~
Voting interest (or voting power) in business and accounting means the total number of votes entitled to be cast on the issue at the time the determination of voting power is made, excluding a vote which is contingent upon the happening of a condition or event which has not occurred at the time. This notion is different from economic interest that refers to a percentage of all the equity issued, including preferred stock, warrants, and so on.
~
Capitalization rate (or \&quot;cap rate\&quot;) is the ratio between the net operating income produced by an asset and its capital cost (the original price paid to buy the asset) or alternatively its current market value. The rate is calculated in a simple fashion as follows:
~
The Treynor ratio (sometimes called the reward-to-volatility ratio or Treynor measure), named after Jack L. Treynor, is a measurement of the returns earned in excess of that which could have been earned on an investment that has no diversifiable risk (e.g. , Treasury Bills or a completely diversified portfolio), per each unit of market risk assumed. The Treynor ratio relates excess return over the risk-free rate to the additional risk taken; however, systematic risk is used instead of total risk.
~
, market depth is the size of an order needed to move the market a given amount. If the market is deep, a large order is needed to change the price. Market depth closely relates to the notion of liquidity
~
Price-to-sales ratio, P/S ratio, or PSR, is a valuation metric for stocks. It is calculated by dividing the company&apos;s market cap by the company&apos;s revenue in the most recent year; or, equivalently, divide the per-share stock price by the per-share revenue. Unless otherwise stated, P/S is \&quot;trailing twelve months\&quot; (TTM), the reported sales for the four previous quarters, although of course longer time periods can be examined.
~
The return on assets (ROA) percentage shows how profitable a company&apos;s assets are in generating revenue. ROA can be computed as: This number tells you what the company can do with what it has, i.e. how many dollars of earnings they derive from each dollar of assets they control. It&apos;s a useful number for comparing competing companies in the same industry. The number will vary widely across different industries.
~
Shares authorized is the maximum number of shares that a company can issue. This number is specified in the company&apos;s articles of association but can be changed by shareholder approval. A company usually authorizes a higher number of shares than required to be able to issue stock in the future.
~
DuPont analysis (also known as the DuPont identity, DuPont equation, DuPont Model or the DuPont method) is an expression which breaks ROE into three parts. The name comes from the DuPont Corporation that started using this formula in the 1920s.
~
Financial regulation is a form of regulation or supervision, which subjects financial institutions to certain requirements, restrictions and guidelines, aiming to maintain the integrity of the financial system. This may be handled by either a government or non-government organization.
~
Sustainable growth rate (SGR) is the maximum rate at which a company can grow revenue without having to invest new equity capital. If a company earns a 15% return on equity (ROE), it can grow 15% simply by reinvesting all the earnings in new opportunities and maintaining a stable debt to equity ratio. In order to grow faster, the company would have to invest more equity capital or increase its financial leverage.
~
Concentrated stock is an equity making up a substantial part (usually, more than 30%) of the investor&apos;s portfolio. The major risk associated with such a portfolio is a lack of diversification; concentrated stock makes a large portion of the investor&apos;s wealth dependent on the performance of one particular stock.

A credit default swap (CDS) is a swap contract and agreement in which the protection buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (often referred to as the CDS \&quot;fee\&quot; or \&quot;spread\&quot;) to the protection seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if a credit instrument (typically a bond or loan) experiences a credit event. In its simplest form, a credit default swap is a bilateral contract between the buyer and seller of protection.

A rally is a period of sustained increases in the prices of stocks, bonds or indexes. This type of price movement can happen during either a bull or a bear market, when it is known as either a bull market rally or a bear market rally, respectively. However, a rally will generally follow a period of flat or declining prices. An increase in prices during a primary trend bear market is called a bear market rally.

Dividend payout ratio is the fraction of net income a firm pays to its stockholders in dividends: The part of the earnings not paid to investors is left for investment to provide for future earnings growth. Investors seeking high current income and limited capital growth prefer companies with high Dividend payout ratio. However investors seeking capital growth may prefer lower payout ratio because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

Restricted stock, also known as letter stock or restricted securities, refers to stock of a company that is not fully transferable until certain conditions have been met. Upon satisfaction of those conditions, the stock becomes transferable by the person holding the award. One type of restricted stock is a form of compensation granted by a company. Typically, the conditions that allow the shares to be transferred are continued employment during a period of time, upon which they vest.

Post-modern portfolio theory (or \&quot;PMPT\&quot;) is an extension of the traditional modern portfolio theory (“MPT”, which is an application of mean-variance analysis or “MVA”). Both theories propose how rational investors should use diversification to optimize their portfolios, and how a risky asset should be priced.

Dividend cover is the ratio of company&apos;s earnings (net income) over the dividend paid to shareholders, calculated as earnings per share divided by the dividend per share. So, if a company has earnings per share of $10.00 and it pays out a dividend of $2.00, the dividend cover is 5.0x.
~
The T-Model is a formula that states the returns earned by holders of a company&apos;s stock in terms of accounting variables obtainable from its financial statements. Specifically, it says that: where T = total return from the stock over a period (appreciation + \&quot;distribution yield\&quot; — see below); g = the growth rate of the company&apos;s book value during the period; PB = the ratio of price / book value at the beginning of the period.

Block trade is a permissible, noncompetitive, privately negotiated transaction either at or exceeding an exchange determined minimum threshold quantity of shares, which is executed apart and away from the open outcry or electronic markets. The size of the trade is usually at least 10,000 shares of a stock or $200,000 of bonds but in practice significantly larger. For instance, a hedge fund holds a large position in Company X and would like to sell it completely.
~
The price/cash flow ratio (also called price-to-cash flow ratio or P/CF), is a ratio used to compare a company&apos;s market value to its cash flow. It is calculated by dividing the company&apos;s market cap by the company&apos;s operating cash flow in the most recent fiscal year (or the most recent four fiscal quarters); or, equivalently, divide the per-share stock price by the per-share operating cash flow. In theory, the lower a stock&apos;s price/cash flow ratio is, the better value that stock is.

Tracking stock, or targeted stock, are specialized equity offerings issued by a company that is based on the operations of a wholly owned subsidiary of a diversified firm. Therefore the tracking stock will be traded at a price related to the operations of the specific division of the company being \&quot;tracked\&quot;. Tracking stock typically has limited or no voting rights. Often, the reason for doing so is to separate a high-growth division from a larger parent company.

A currency future, also FX future or foreign exchange future, is a futures contract to exchange one currency for another at a specified date in the future at a price that is fixed on the purchase date; see Foreign exchange derivative. Typically, one of the currencies is the US dollar. The price of a future is then in terms of US dollars per unit of other currency. This can be different from the standard way of quoting in the spot foreign exchange markets.

Risk-free interest rate is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk, including default risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest that an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a given period of time. Therefore, a rational investor will reject all the investments yielding sub-risk-free returns.

, the exchange rates (also known as the foreign-exchange rate, forex rate or FX rate) between two currencies specify how much one currency is worth in terms of the other. It is the value of a foreign nation’s currency in terms of the home nation’s currency. For example an exchange rate of 91 Japanese yen (JPY, ¥) to the United States dollar (USD, $) means that JPY 91 is worth the same as USD 1.

A swap is a derivative in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for another party&apos;s stream of cash flows. Interest rate swaps can be used by hedgers to manage their fixed or floating assets and liabilities. They can also be used by speculators to replicate unfunded bond exposures to profit from changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are very popular and highly liquid instruments.

, a trader is someone who buys and sells financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives. A broker who simply fills buy or sell orders is not a trader, as they are merely executing instructions given to them. According to the Wall Street Journal in 2004, a managing director convertible-bond trader was earning between $700,000 and $900,000 on average. Traders are either professionals working in a financial institution or a corporation, or individual investors, or day traders.

, a share is a unit of account for various financial instruments including stocks, and investments in limited partnerships, and real estate investment trusts. The common feature of all these is equity participation (limited in the case of preference shares). The term stocks in the plural is often used as a synonym for shares. Traditionalist demands that the plural stocks be used only when referring to stock of more than one company are rarely heard nowadays.
~
, arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit at zero cost.
~
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and trades at approximately the same price as the net asset value of its underlying assets over the course of the trading day. Most ETFs track an index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or MSCI EAFE. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features.
~
, the strike price, or exercise price, is a key variable in a derivatives contract between two parties. Where the contract requires delivery of the underlying instrument, the trade will be at the strike price, regardless of the spot price (market price) of the underlying instrument at that time. Definition - The fixed price at which the owner of an option can purchase (in the case of a call), or sell (in the case of a put), the underlying security or commodity.
~
, a hedge is a position established in one market in an attempt to offset exposure to price fluctuations in some opposite position in another market with the goal of minimizing one&apos;s exposure to unwanted risk. There are many specific financial vehicles to accomplish this, including insurance policies, forward contracts, swaps, options, many types of over-the-counter and derivative products, and perhaps most popularly, futures contracts.
~
In finance, a contract for difference (or CFD) is a contract between two parties, typically described as \&quot;buyer\&quot; and \&quot;seller\&quot;, stipulating that the seller will pay to the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at contract time. (If the difference is negative, then the buyer pays instead to the seller. ) In effect CFDs are financial derivatives that allow investors to take advantage of prices moving up or prices moving down on underlying financial instruments and are often used to speculate on those markets.k

A collective investment scheme is a way of investing money with others to participate in a wider range of investments than feasible for most individual investors, and to share the costs and benefits of doing so. Terminology varies with country but collective investment schemes are often referred to as mutual funds, investment funds, managed funds, or simply funds . Around the world large markets have developed around collective investment and these account for a substantial portion of all trading on major stock exchanges.

A credit linked note (CLN) is a form of funded credit derivative. It is structured as a security with an embedded credit default swap allowing the issuer to transfer a specific credit risk to credit investors. The issuer is not obligated to repay the debt if a specified event occurs. This eliminates a third-party insurance provider. It is issued by a special purpose company or trust, designed to offer investors par value at maturity unless the referenced entity defaults.

The forward price is the agreed upon price of an asset in a forward contract. Using the rational pricing assumption, we can express the forward price in terms of the spot price and any dividends etc. , so that there is no possibility for arbitrage.
~
, the Greeks are the quantities representing the sensitivities of the price of derivatives such as options to a change in underlying parameters on which the value of an instrument or portfolio of financial instruments is dependent. The name is used because the most common of these sensitivities are often denoted by Greek letters. Collectively these have also been called the risk sensitivities, risk measures or hedge parameters.

, moneyness is a measure of the degree to which a derivative is likely to have positive monetary value at its expiration, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability, or in standard deviations.
~
An employee stock option is a call option on the common stock of a company, issued as a form of non-cash compensation. Restrictions on the option (such as vesting and limited transferability) attempt to align the holder&apos;s interest with those of the business&apos; shareholders. If the company&apos;s stock rises, holders of options generally experience a direct financial benefit. This gives employees an incentive to behave in ways that will boost the company&apos;s stock price.
~
, a straddle is an investment strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves, regardless of the direction of price movement. The purchase of particular option derivatives is known as a long straddle, while the sale of the option derivatives is known as a short straddle.
~
An interest rate futures is a financial derivative with an interest-bearing instrument as the underlying asset. Examples include Treasury-bill futures, Treasury-bond futures and Eurodollar futures.

A market is any one of a variety of different systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby businesses sell their goods, services and labor to people in exchange for money. Goods and services are sold using a legal tender such as fiat money. This activity forms part of the economy. It is an arrangement that allows buyers and sellers to exchange items. Competition is essential in markets, and separates market from trade.
~
Contango is a term used in the futures market to describe an upward sloping forward curve (as in the normal yield curve). Such a forward curve is said to be \&quot;in contango\&quot; (or sometimes \&quot;contangoed\&quot;). Formally, it is the situation where, and the amount by which, the price of a commodity for future delivery is higher than the spot price, or a far future delivery price higher than a nearer future delivery.

Open interest (also known as open contracts or open commitments) refers to the total number of derivative contracts, like futures and options, that have not been settled in the immediately previous time period for a specific underlying security. A large open interest indicates more activity and liquidity for the contract. For each buyer of a futures contract there must be a seller. From the time the buyer or seller opens the contract until the counter-party closes it, that contract is considered &apos;open&apos;.
~
Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) is a capital guarantee derivative security that embeds a dynamic trading strategy in order to provide participation to the performance of a certain underlying. See also dynamic asset allocation. The intuition behind CPPI was adopted from the interest rate universe. In order to be able to guarantee the capital invested, the option writer (option seller) needs to buy a zero-coupon bond and use the proceeds to get the exposure he wants.
~
, a volatility swap is a forward contract on the future realised volatility of a given underlying asset. Volatility swaps allow investors to trade the volatility of an asset directly, much as they would trade a price index. The underlying is usually a foreign exchange (FX) rate (very liquid market) but could be as well a single name equity or index. However, the variance swap is preferred in the equity market due to the fact it can be replicated with a linear combination of options and a dynamic position in futures.

~
Single-stock futures (SSF&apos;s) are futures contracts with the underlying asset being one particular stock, usually in batches of 100. When purchased, no transmission of share rights or dividends occurs. Being futures contracts they are traded on margin, thus offering leverage, and they are not subject to the short selling limitations that stocks are. They are traded in various financial markets, including those of the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, India and others.
~
In financial terminology, backwardation means a downward sloping forward curve (as in an inverted yield curve). A backwardation starts when the difference between the forward price and the spot price is less than the cost of carry, or when there can be no delivery arbitrage because the asset is not currently available for purchase. The opposite market condition to backwardation is known as contango, in which the expected spot price at maturity is lower than the forward price.
~
In finance, the style or family of an option is a general term denoting the class into which the option falls, usually defined by the dates on which the option may be exercised. The vast majority of options are either European or American (style) options. These options - as well as others where the payoff is calculated similarly - are referred to as \&quot;vanilla options\&quot;. Options where the payoff is calculated differently are categorized as \&quot;exotic options\&quot;.
~
An interest rate derivative is a derivative where the underlying asset is the right to pay or receive a notional amount of money at a given interest rate. The interest rate derivatives market is the largest derivatives market in the world. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the notional amount outstanding in June 2009 were US$437 trillion for OTC interest rate contracts, and US$342 trillion for OTC interest rate swaps.
~
A fund derivative is a financial structured product related to a fund, normally using the underlying fund to determine the payoff. This may be a private equity fund, mutual fund or hedge fund. Purchasers obtain exposure to the underlying fund (or funds) whilst improving their risk profile over a direct investment. For example the purchaser may be attracted by a fund&apos;s star manager, performance history or strategy, whilst improving their counterparty risk and getting leverage, currency hedging or a capital guarantee via the derivative.h 
~
A variance swap is an over-the-counter financial derivative that allows one to speculate on or hedge risks associated with the magnitude of movement, i.e. volatility, of some underlying product, like an exchange rate, interest rate, or stock index. One leg of the swap will pay an amount based upon the realised variance of the price changes of the underlying product. Conventionally, these price changes will be daily log returns, based upon the most commonly used closing price.
~
A covered call is a financial market transaction in which the seller of call options owns the corresponding amount of the underlying instrument, such as shares of a stock or other securities. If the trader buys the underlying instrument at the same time as he sells the call, the strategy is often called a \&quot;buy-write\&quot; strategy. In equilibrium, the strategy has the same payoffs as writing a put option.
~
A Foreign exchange derivative is a financial derivative where the underlying is a particular currency and/or its exchange rate. These instruments are used either for currency speculation and arbitrage or for hedging foreign exchange risk.

The forward market is the over-the-counter financial market in contracts for future delivery, so called forward contracts. Forward contracts are personalized between parties (i.e. , delivery time and amount are determined between seller and customer). The forward market is a general term used to describe the informal market by which these contracts are entered into. Standardized forward contracts are called futures contracts and traded on a futures exchange.

, the binomial options pricing model (BOPM) provides a generalizable numerical method for the valuation of options. The binomial model was first proposed by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979). Essentially, the model uses a \&quot;discrete-time\&quot; model of the varying price over time of the underlying financial instrument.
~
, inflation derivative (or inflation-indexed derivatives) refers to an over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative that is used to transfer inflation risk from one counterparty to another. Typically, real rate swaps also come under this bracket, such as asset swaps of inflation-indexed bonds (government-issued inflation-indexed bonds, such as the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, UK inflation-linked gilt-edged securities, French OATeis, Italian BTPeis, German Bundeis and Japanese JGBis are prominent examples).

The Black model (sometimes known as the Black-76 model) is a variant of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Its primary applications are for pricing bond options, interest rate caps / floors, and swaptions. It was first presented in a paper written by Fischer Black in 1976. Black&apos;s model can be generalized into a class of models known as log-normal forward models, also referred to as LIBOR market model.
~
A cliquet option or ratchet option is an exotic option consisting of a series of consecutive forward start options. The first is active immediately. The second becomes active when the first expires, etc. Each option is struck at-the-money when it becomes active. A cliquet is, therefore, a series of at-the-money options but where the total premium is determined in advance. A cliquet can be thought of as a series of \&quot;pre-purchased\&quot; at-the-money options.
~
An equity swap is a financial derivative contract where a set of future cash flows are agreed to be exchanged between two counterparties at set dates in the future. The two cash flows are usually referred to as \&quot;legs\&quot; of the swap; one of these \&quot;legs\&quot; is usually pegged to a floating rate such as LIBOR. This leg is also commonly referred to as the \&quot;floating leg\&quot;. The other leg of the swap is based on the performance of either a share of stock or a stock market index.

A married put is formed when an investor buys shares (increments of 100 or commensurate amount) of a stock and, at the same time, a put option contract. See SEC definition of a married put in Section II of the following: http://www. sec. gov/rules/interp/34-48795. htm Establishing a married put position is what the investment community would consider as a hedge on an investment. The best way to understand hedging (establishing a Married Put) is to think of it as insurance.

Options spreads are the basic building blocks of many options trading strategies. A spread position is entered by buying and selling equal number of options of the same class on the same underlying security but with different strike prices or expiration dates. The three main classes of spreads are the horizontal spread, the vertical spread and the diagonal spread. They are grouped by the relationships between the strike price and expiration dates of the options involved.we

, expiration is the date on which the contract expires. The option holder must elect to exercise the option or allow it to expire worthless. Typically, option contracts expire according to a pre-determined calendar. For instance, for U.S. exchange-listed equity option contracts, the expiration date is always on the Saturday that follows the third Friday of the month, unless that Friday is a market holiday, in which case the expiration is on the Friday.
~
In options trading, a bull spread is a bullish, vertical spread options strategy that is designed to profit from a moderate rise in the price of the underlying security. Because of put-call parity, a bull spread can be constructed using either put options or call options. If constructed using calls, it is a bull call spread. If constructed using puts, it is a bull put spread.

A swaption is an option granting its owner the right but not the obligation to enter into an underlying swap. Although options can be traded on a variety of swaps, the term \&quot;swaption\&quot; typically refers to options on interest rate swap
~
Pin risk occurs when the underlier of an option contract settles close to the option&apos;s strike value at expiration. In this situation, the underlier is said to have pinned. The risk to the writer (seller) of the option is that they cannot predict with 100% accuracy whether the option will be exercised or not. Therefore, the writer may end up with a residual position in the underlier. There is a chance that the price of the underlier may gap adversely, resulting in an unanticipated loss to the writer.
~
, a calendar spread (also called a time spread or horizontal spread) is a spread trade involving the simultaneous purchase of futures or options expiring in a particular month and the sale of the same instrument expiring in another month. The legs of the spread vary only in expiration month; they are based on the same underlying market and strike price. The usual case involves the purchase of futures or options expiring in a more distant month and the sale of futures or options in a more nearby month.
~
The backspread is the converse strategy to the ratio spread and is also known as reverse ratio spread. Using calls, a bullish strategy known as the call backspread can be constructed and with puts, a strategy known as the put backspread can be constructed.
~
A correlation swap is an over-the-counter financial derivative that allows one to speculate on or hedge risks associated with the observed average correlation, of a collection of underlying products, where each product has periodically observable prices, as with a commodity, exchange rate, interest rate, or stock index.
~
Ratio-spread is a strategy in options trading that involves buying some number of options and selling a larger number of other options of the same underlying market and (usually) the same expiration date, but of a different strike price. Ideally, this strategy should be used when either A) the implied volatility of the options expiring in a particular month has recently moved sharply higher and is now beginning to decline, or B) the trader believes for whatever reason that the underlying market of the option(s) will move steadily in his favor during the life of the option.y

In finance, a strangle is an investment strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves, with relatively minimal exposure to the direction of price movement. The purchase of particular option derivatives is known as a long strangle, while the sale of the option derivatives is known as a short strangle.
~
, a binary option is a type of option where the payoff is either some fixed amount of some asset or nothing at all. The two main types of binary options are the cash-or-nothing binary option and the asset-or-nothing binary option. The cash-or-nothing binary option pays some fixed amount of cash if the option expires in-the-money while the asset-or-nothing pays the value of the underlying security. Thus, the options are binary in nature because there are only two possible outcomes.
~
A conditional variance swap is a type of swap Derivative (finance) product that allows investors to take exposure to volatility in the price of an underlying security only while the underlying security is within a pre-specified price range. This ability could be useful for hedging complex volatility exposures, making a bet on the volatility levels contained in the skew of the underlying security&apos;s price, or buying/selling variance at more attractive levels given a view on the underlying security.
~
Finite difference methods for option pricing are numerical methods used in mathematical finance for the valuation of options. Finite difference methods were first applied to option pricing by Eduardo Schwartz in 1977. Finite difference methods can solve derivative pricing problems that have, in general, the same level of complexity as those problems solved by tree approaches, and are therefore usually employed only when other approaches are inappropriate.
~
Compound option or split fee option is option on an option. The exercise payoff of a compound option involves the value of another option. A compound option then has two expiration dates and two strike prices. Usually, compounded options are used for currency or fixed income markets where insecurity exists regarding the option’s risk protection. Another common business application that compound options are used for—to hedge bids for business projects that may or may not be accepted.
~
A real estate derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on the price of real estate. The core uses for real estate derivatives are: hedging positions, pre-investing assets and re-allocating a portfolio. The major products within real estate derivatives are: swaps, futures contracts, options (calls and puts) and structured products. Each of these products can use a different real estate index.
~
A forward start option is an option that commences at some specified future date with an expiration further in the future. It is essentially a forward on an option, only the premium is paid in advance. Since the asset price at the start of this option is not known a priori, it is common to specify that the strike price will be set in the future so that the option is initially at the money or a certain percentage in the money or out of the money.
~
The Trinomial tree is a lattice based computational model used in financial mathematics to price options. It was developed by Phelim Boyle in 1986. It is an extension of the Binomial options pricing model, and is conceptually similar. It can also be shown that the approach is equivalent to the explicit finite difference method for option pricing. Under the trinomial method, the underlying stock price is modeled as a recombining tree, where, at each node the price has three possible paths: an up, down and stable or middle path.
