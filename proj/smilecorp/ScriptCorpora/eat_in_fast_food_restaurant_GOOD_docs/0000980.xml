 Joe Fish Unusually bad experience 
by coastalshell ( 1 review )
 July 11, 2012 I&apos;ve been to this restaurant several times and have had great experiences. Tonight I went there for dinner and found a hair in my salad. When I pointed it out to the waitress, she asked me if I was sure it wasn&apos;t lettuce....really? It was a dark hair. Not so much as an apology and I got charged full price (the salad cost extra $). I&apos;m not normally a restaurant snob, but I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ll be going back after this experience.

 Mint Indian Cusine Chicken tikka masala by Kate Ashbrook ( 3 reviews )
 July 10, 2012 - My husband and I love Indian cuisine. We attempt to cook it at home occasionally, but after discovering the flavorful food at Mint, I think we will leave the cooking to them! The Chicken Tikka Masala is absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend trying it along with the garlic naan. The food and service at Mint definitely rivals that of the most popular Indian restaurants in Charlotte. Give it a shot, you won&apos;t regret it! :)

 Monterrey Mexican Restaurant Not My Favorite Monterrey but Good 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 July 10, 2012 - Let me start by explaining the unusual title. I live in Cornelius and the Monterrey Mexican that we have there is lot newer and have a much better atmosphere and decor. The building this Monterrey is in is a small strio mall off of Hwy 150 and is really dated and small. Take that away and the rest is the same. Food is great allthough a little less expansive than the Cornelius location and the service everytime I have been there has been excellent. For lunch, anyone of the combination platters works great and for dinner, the shirimp fajitata was excellent. Generally I eaten at this restaurant at lunchtime and I appreciate the fact that service is quick, the food is good and at the same time, it&apos;s a good value.

 J.J. Wasabi&apos;s Seriously? 
by NCBornandRaised ( 1 review )
 July 08, 2012 - I frequent JJ&apos;s quite often especially after work. Whether it&apos;s for a drink or for their awesome rice bowl! Doe&apos;s the establishment need to be polished in certain areas. Yes, but some complaints I have seen on here I have yet to witness. If you are getting looks and scowls from the wait staff here, which happen to be some of the friendliest including the owner himself, the you may want to look in the mirror. In fact I have yet to see a person have to wait to be seated at any given time. Secondly, some reviewers need to keep comments about their own discrimination of&quot;local&apos;s&quot;around the area and them being hired at local businesses to themselves. If you love the area you came from so much please feel free to hang out at the 5 million&quot;italian/sub-par pizza joints&quot;around the area or better yet go back to that area and live life full of yourself, stuck up, and happy.

 Si Senor Mexican Restaurant Underwhelming but with Potential 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 July 07, 2012 - Ever been to a restaurant where all the elements for a great restaurant were there but they just did not come together. This is one of those places. Walked in the door and the manager/owner (not sure which) was on the phone with one of his buddies. You could easily tell it was a personal call and not a business call. The only times he would permit himself to be interrupted was one of the staff would come up with a question. The least he could have done is instruct one of the staff to go ahead and seat the gentleman. Finally did get seated and I will give him credit, he did apologize. At this point, service was excellent. Menu&apos;s were presented, drink order taken and delivered very promptly. Perfunctory salsa and tortilla chips very promptly delivered along with Pico de Gallo which is something you rarely see in this market unless requested. The menu is very extensive but settled on one of my favorites whch was the Fish Tacos.The meny photography is excellent. Placed my order and went after the salsa and chips. The salsa had a good bite to it and was not thin and watery. Only complaint was the Picco de Gallo and from the consistency, I would guess that it was at least 4 hours old if not older. Very lame and watery and no hint of cilantro or anything else. The Fish Taco&apos;s arrived in a timely fashion and were immediately a disappointment. Each taco was wrapped in aluminum foil and the steam was such that the starch in eacy taco, had glued the taco to the foil. Rather than call them fish tacos, a better name would have been red cabbage tacos because that is all you could taste. Close examination revealed very little fish. One medium size fish could probably make at least 30 tacos from what I could see. The green chili sauce that came with it was the high point of the meal. The rice was good as far a rice goes but then again, I&apos;m not a fan or rice so my opinion does not mean much. From what I could see, as I pointed out earlier, the photography was great and in most cases, the photography was better than the food was. Chalk one up for Photoshop. I had ordered Iced Tea as my beverage. While initial service was excellent, I did not see my server after my meal was delivered until the very end of the meal. Not once did he at least check to see if I needed a refill on my tea. As far as atmosphere, it&apos;s the same decor as when Cartucci&apos;s was here which was an Italian Restaurant. Mexican or Italian, you can&apos;t tell the difference so the decor does not accent the theme of the restaurant. So much for the negative. There is enough positive things going on here to where this could be a very good restaurant. The basic elements are there. First thing to be addressed is service starting with management. You don&apos;t leave a customer standing there while you&apos;re discussing the weather. You at least have someone come over and seat him. Initial service was good but it stopped once the food was delivered. Service should continue throught out the entire meal. After the food has been served, the bulk of the time and effort of the server has already been expended and it does not take that much more to check back and make sure that his beverage is still full. The last item is the quality of the food. Right now the food is rather bland and proper care is not being done in either preparation or presentation. Items like Picco de Gallo have a short time life and become waterly and bland very quickly. Make smaller batches and just make them more frequently. It is more effort but the extra effort shows up in the qualtiy of the food. Bottom line is that Si Senor has the elements to be a very good restaurant but currently the execution is spotty and not uniform. Management needs to take a look at ways to insure a more consistent product. If they do that, then they will be a sucess.

 Vinnie&apos;s Sardine Grill&amp;Raw Bar Worst service ever

 Prickly Pear Not good since the move to the lake 
by James ( 1 review )
 July 05, 2012 - Slow service ... Poor atmosphere ... Mediocre food.   Since moving the lake, this place has lost most of its charm, a lot of its flavor and almost all of its service.  It took 30 minutes after we finished to get he bill!  While we were seated quickly and got our appetizer quickly, the entree and drink refills were super slow.   Also, the food quality seems to have gone down.  I can no longer recommend thislace that I used to love.

 Lotus Chinese Restaurant Great Food! 
by ATIS , Atlanta
 ( 102 reviews )
 July 05, 2012 - After years of Chineese buffets, you forget Chineese food used to be a experience. Lotus serves food family style and serves it HOT and FRESH to your table. Service was very fast an crisp and the food was fantastic. Having lived about half my life close to NYC, I usually judge a place by their egg foo young and how it compared to home. It was spot on; the rest of the food was as well. I like this place, and fear I may not loo forward to luke warm food in steam tables any longer.

 June 30, 2012 - In a local hotel. Had them deliver. Tho it had a simple, good taste, crust on pizza was too tough. Beef on pizza was unbelievablly bland. Pepperoni was good. Appetizers... Fried zucchini was carelessly battered and limp. Cheddar poppers good (though no ranch by default). Mozzarella sticks average-to-good. Fried ravioli great... if you like tasteless ricotta.

 Carolina Ribs on the Run Good Stuff 
by Robert Hallman ( 1 review )
 June 27, 2012 I recently had a birthday party for approximately 40 people. I will have to say that the food made the day. Everyone raved about the ribs and pulled pork. The potato salad was also a big hit. The ribs were as advertised and both the flavors we had was off the hook. I will assure you that this is only the first time for me and there will be pleanty of others in my future.

 Tokyo Japanese Restaurant chicken soba noodles by Kari , North Carolina
 ( 2 reviews )
 June 19, 2012 We stopped in for a quick mid afternoon lunch. I ordered the chicken soba noodles, and my friend the hibachi chicken. The chicken was so tender! I have never experienced such amazing flavor and texture of food at a Japanese Restaurant, from all price points. My friend and I were both very impressed, we will have to stop back in for the buffet. I am ordering online now, because I can&apos;t stop drooling over it! The owners were so nice, they chatted with us at our table for a few moments, and invited us to bring our friends/family. I will definitely visit this place on the regular!

 Jeffrey&apos;s Restaurant It was alright 
by The Rock Foodie , North Carolina
 ( 12 reviews )
 June 19, 2012 - Went here on a recommendation from a client. I was traveling to Mooresville and had to run out for lunch. The special was catfish for the Blue Plate Special. I had sides of vegetable medley and red beans and rice. Portions were good but the food had little to no seasonings. Too much breading on the catfish. No umph in the red beans and rice however the vegetables were cooked good. I have to say that the best thing we had to eat was my wife&apos;s french fries. Atmosphere and service was good but with all the food choices in the area I&apos;d look for another option for lunch.

 Prickly Pear mobile review 
by Bill ( 10 reviews )
 June 17, 2012 - I used to love it, but am now taking a break. The service is awful. Today we arrived promptly for our 1pm reservation and were pleased to see they weren&apos;t packed. We thought we had a fighting chance for decent service this time. Nope. Waited 10 minutes before anyone came over to say&quot;Hello, and welcome to Prickly Pear. Here is some water.&quot;We ultimately decided on a taco salad and a quesadilla. Forty five minutes later the food showed up. A table of 2 in the middle of te afternoon in a relatively empty restaurant should not have to wait that long. The server kept coming by to tell us that our food would be out soon but never offered an explanation as to why it was taking so long and never even apologized. Management nowhere in sight. To worsen the situation the taco salad came out with the wrong dressing. Be weary when using a coupon, they will automatically 20% you but will give you no indication that they did so. There&apos;s no math shown on the itemized receipt showing where the top was put on and the server certainly made no mention of it. It should also be mentioned that the last time we were there we ordered a bottle of La Crema Chardonnay and realized something didn&apos;t quite taste right when we sipped it. When we questioned our server a out it they admitted they were&quot;changing the wine list&quot;and gave us something else in its place. When we said we didn&apos;t want that, they also admitted that not 1 single wine that was on the list was actually being served. Seems like they&apos;re more interested in making a buck than having happy customers who return. Not going back anytime soon.

 Blue Parrot Tequila Sunrise by john ( 1 review )
 June 14, 2012 - I usually visit the blue parrot a few times in the spring/summer season as many of my friends live in the area and this is their local favorite. The view is amazing and the scene is always a good time. Yesterday was one of those days - a beautiful wednesday and perfect for a light bite with some adult beverages.

 Burrito Loco Was hoping for better, wound up disappointed 
by ross ( 1 review )
 June 06, 2012 - We just tried this place tonight with my wife and two toddlers. We got the Loco Burrito and the Pastor Burrito, and a Chico (hot dog) for the kids to split. We got two small drinks for the kids, a soda for me and water for my wife. Total was $25.38, which is pretty steep considering no free chips and salsa. $4.50 for a kids meal that doesn&apos;t include a drink is way more than other semi-fast food places like this. So about the burritos: My wife and I both like authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex equally, and while this is more authentic than Tex, the only word I can sum up the entire meal with is: plain-jane. The burritos were a good size, but both hers and mine were very blah, with NO spice at all, and I mean zero. I mean they were as spicy as the cafeteria burritos from high school, ya know? I paid .50 extra for peppers and onions, and .25 more for sour cream, and I am sure glad I did because without those it would have had no flavor at all. I told my wife it tasted like a burrito I would have made back in college from one of those frozen&quot;kits&quot;you get in the grocery store, with the chicken breast, peppers and onions all frozen in one package. But then I forgot to add the seasoning packet. It wasn&apos;t BAD, it was just BLAH, and my wife&apos;s Pastor was very blah too. The kids loved the hotdog and fries, no complaints there. I normally don&apos;t write reviews, but I joined Urbanspoon just to write this so others will know it ain&apos;t so great. For comparison, we really like Chipotle, and we go to Moe&apos;s about 1/month, it&apos;s the next best thing to Chipotle up here in the lake area, but still not awesome. And Qdoba is about as good as Burrito Loco, just plain. Save your money and go to Moe&apos;s where the chips and salsa are free and the food is served faster and with more options to spice it up. We get the same meal at Moe&apos;s for $23 and it&apos;s WAY better. I really wanted to like this place, I was hoping to make it our new fave Mexican place around here, but I&apos;ll have to keep looking.

 The Daily Grind Grill and Cafe - Downtown And From Bad to Worse 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 May 27, 2012 - This is the third time I have reviewed this restaurant although I&apos;ve eaten there a couple of other times in between the first time in Feb 2011 and today not covered by reviews or comments. Started out great but each time I go, it&apos;s getting progressiviely worse which explains the titile of this review. Walked in and they were busy but they did accomodate us fairly quickly and I give them points for that. The waiter took our order and promptly brought us both sweet and unsweet tea although no one had ordered the unsweet tea. Forgot my Sister-in-Laws hot tea and my coffee. Placed our order which seemed to go well. I ordered Stuffed French Toast stuffed with Peanut Butter and Bananas topped with their signature Caramel Sauce. Ten minutes later I was informed they were out of the Caramel Sauce and till is only 11:00 am in a Sunday Brunch that lasts till 3:00. Changed my order to Steak and Eggs with Hashbrowns on the side trying to keep it simple. My wife ordered a Panini off of the Lunch Memu while my Sister-in-Law ordered a cup of Minestroni Soup (the Soup of the Day) and Eggs Benedict. Soup came quickly and after what seemed an eternity, my wife&apos;s Panini and my Steak and Eggs showed up. We had even asked our server at one time if there was a problem and was told that they were just running a bit behind n the kitchen and it would be out shortly. Problem was my Steak and Eggs were cold and my Sister-in-Law&apos;s Eggs Benedict did not show up. They eventually showed up 5 minutes later with an explanation that the kitchen had&quot;overlooked&quot;her order. In addition to the Steak and Eggs being cold, the hashbrowns were overcooked to just this side of charcoal and were extremely greasy. Came til to pay at the register and low and behold, they run our of paper in the printer and had to go to the back to get a new spool of paper. My Sister-in-Law was next and gave the cashier $15.13 on a $14.13 bill. Cashier had to go to the back to get change for f$5 so that she could give my Sister-in-Law all of her change of $1.00 Totally disorganized, food quality has continues to go downhill, servers or kitchen staff cannot get orders right... Restaurant has potential and I keep hoping for improvement which is the only reason I keep going back. With the current trend, it&apos;s going to be a good while before I visit this one again.

 Laney&apos;s Fish Camp OVER COOKED 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 May 22, 2012 - Took awhile to get here again but not a great loss. Went to Laney&apos;s years ago and it was good. Went back a couple of days ago and it was a disappointment. Typical Southern fish camp in presentattion but stops there. A typical Souther Fish Camp took pride in serving a nice flaky fish with plenty of falvor. Fish should still be moist. Quality was expected of the other ingredients such as slay, fries and the ever present ice tea. Went several years ago and everything looked fine. Latest excursion revealed the foolwoing: Fish - Is it really fish? So overcooked I couldn&apos;t tell Hush Puppies - Hockey Pucks. Way overcooked Slay - Good Fries - Greasy and will not accept salt. Service - Poor. Generally you see the server way after you have a problem and need something. All in all, decent restaurant going down hill. They either need to address their problems or continue on and down the road, close because your customers got feed up and went elsewhere.

 Sauza&apos;s Mexican Restaurant Outstanding - Great Authenic Mexican and Service as Well 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 May 19, 2012 - This has been one of those restaurants I&apos;ve been wanting to try but never got around to it. Consistently ranks high in the Mooresville listing with an approval rating over 91%. Finally made it by this evening and I&apos;ve sorry I have not been there sooner. Except for a brief delay waiting to be seated when I walked in, the service was impecable. If my waiter was busy at another table or bring out food, another waiter would jump in so my every need was met. Totaly opposite from another restaurant I had eaten at earlier in the day. Was seated and menu&apos;s presented and before I had even gotten through the first few lines of the menu, the tortilla chips were served with salsa and a bowl of pico de gallo. The pico de gallo was a pleasant surpise since normally in this area, all you get is the salsa. My drink order followed closely behind. The salsa was a surprise because it had some fire to it. Most Mexican restaurants in the area tone it down somewhat. The pico de gallo was excellent. The tomatoes and onions were freshly chopped and the cilantro, oil, lime and garlic were in a perfect ratio to each other. The salsa is the type you get in Northern Mexico such are around Guadalajara or Monterrey. Fairly extensive menu but decided to try the Tacos Mexicana which was four tacos and I got my choice of steak, chicken, pulled pork or Chorizo. Told my waiter I was having a problem deciding and he suggested I try one of each. Good choice. I did not think I would like the Chorizo but that turned out to be my favorite followed by the pulled pork. The steak which I was leaning toward in the first place turned out to be my least favorite but only because everything else was so outstanding.. Taco&apos;s were double layered with two warm soft tortillas and the meat was topped with chopped cilantro and onions and green salsa was served on the side for the customer to use as he so desired. Great combination of flavors, visual appearance and presentation. I was always leary about this restaurant&apos;s atmosphere. It&apos;s tucked into an aging strip mall and is not very impressive on the outside. Looks are indeed very deciving. Inside it very tastefully decorated and is warm, friendly and inviting. Listening to the wait staff and other personnel, it is obvious that this is real Mexican because English is definately a second language but at the same time, there is no language barrier between the customer and the staff. I&apos;m sorry I have not made it here before but I will be back again shortly. I&apos;m also going to give it favorite rating and I very rarely ever do that. Great Service and Great Food and the cost of the entree was still less than $10 makes for a fantastic value.

 May 19, 2012 - We have eaten there twice for breakfast and ordered french toast, eggs and bacon. The French Toast is really great but on both occasions we have not received our entire order at the same time and have to keep reminding someone to bring us the rest of our order. A manager should be working and stay on top of the service you are providing. I now understand why you only have a 32% like rating on Urbanspoon with this type of service. People don&apos;t go back to places with bad service...fix it!

It may be a small place out in the middle of nowhere but I sure am glad they are there. If ever in the area, I recommend that you stop by to see for yourself why I love to eat at this little place.

 May 08, 2012 I was pleasantly surprised by their fantastic home cooking at McCann&apos;s. I&apos;ve tried lots of item on their menu and they are all good. All of the staff is friendly and inviting. It&apos;s worth the trip to McCann&apos;s, if you like good food and a great atmosphere.

 Comet Grill Basic Cafe with Good Food 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 May 06, 2012 - Nothing fancy here. Just good basic good food with good service and reasonable prices. Good Place for lunch. In the everchanging restaurant landscape, once upon a time Greg&apos;s was across the street but they closed and what was Trackside moved in. This location is the previous site for Trackside for those who have been away from Mooresville for a couple of years. Like most small restaurants of this type in the area, this one is owned by a Greek family but this family has a long history of very successful and very good eateries in Charlotte. Standard American food is on the menu along with some traditional Greek favorites like Gyro&apos;s, Pitas, Souvlaki and a variety of other dishes. I had lunch there of Friday along with a business associate. We were promptly greeted and seated when we walked in the door by very friendly staff. I had the Gyro and he opted for a standard Cheeseburger. Both had fries and a side salad to go along with the meal. In my case, my meal was very good and they managed to get the texture of the fries exacatly right which is one of the areas I am very particular on. I know it should easy but it&apos;s not easy to make a perfect fry. My friend indicated that his burger was excellent as well. The salads were very good and they did not skimp on the more expensive components such as tomatoes. cukes, onions etc. Service as I pointed out is very good and I was very impressed with how clean the restaurant was kept. Not fancy and definately not four star but what do you expect. It&apos;s a great, no-frills place for a good lunch in a short period of time and for a very reasonable price. Good food + good service+ nice restaurant + good price = great value

 Rice Fun Restaurant mobile review

 May 05, 2012 Didn&apos;t overcook the vegetables, which is rare to find with Chinese restaurants. They had good food, my complaints are that there was way too much sauce on everything, and the fried rice tasted strange, I only had one bite of it. The crispy chicken was delicious.

 Chopstix Thai Restaurant Great Thai - The Statesville Tradition Continues 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 May 03, 2012 - Chopstix has long been a Statesville tradition and is generally rated as one of the best in Statesville. The family tradition continues. This is their second and newest location and has only been open about a month. I believe one of the daughter&apos;s runs this facility. The food is still great and uses the same recipes that made Statesville great. Tried one my my favorites which was Ped Ga Poaw which in this case is duck in a basil sauce and it was excellent. For lunch I would suggest the Pad Thai and you have your choice of beef, chicken or seafood or if you&apos;re vegetarian, tofu as the meat portion. At lot of people think of Thai cusine as being fiery and spicy. Some can be but there is a whole side of Thai cusine that is more like Vietnamese with delicate flavors and sauces. This place showcases both sides of Thai Cusine and if you are new to this asian style, ask the server. They are very well trained and can help you find what you want. Prices are the best for any Thai restaurant in the area. Most Thai restaurants in the Charlotte area like to position Thai food as a high end cuisine with a high end price which mainly reflects a high profit margin. This restaurant and it&apos;s parent restaurant in Statesville have kept to the tradition that Thai food is the food of the Thai food and while unique to us, it is still the everyday food. The restaurant in Statesville feels more like a small family restaurant with small tables and rather cramped quarters. This one in Mooresville is in a recently closed Italian restaurant and is only the second tenant in a building that is probably less than 1 1/2 years old so it&apos;s a rather new building. This has given them room to open up so the feeling in the dining room is more relaxed and airy which is very pleasant. Staff is great and several of the servers are familiar faces from Statesville so there is a well trained core of wait staff at this restaurant. This is one place I will be going back to. Glad to see this addition to the Mooresville dining experience.

 Mint Indian Cusine Love the food 
by lovethisfood ( 1 review )
 April 29, 2012 - We have been to this restaurant innumerable times and are never disappointed. I prefer eating a la carte at night as opposed to the lunch time buffet. My husband however prefers the buffet. The food is extremely tasty and the service is good. We always look forward to eating here

 McCann&apos;s Place Not Worth the Trip 
by Bill Williams ( 477 reviews )
 April 28, 2012 - I had been looking forward to trying this restaurant for some time. Comment sposted on their website and on other Social Media sounded promising and I was looking for an additona place where I could grab a decent breakfast. This turned out to be a great disappointment. The place is in the middle of no where and you have to make an effort to find it. Based on the quality of the food served this morning, it&apos;s not worth the effort. The restaurant is basically two trailer hooked together at a 90 degree angle. The front is the kitchen area and a large deli counter in front. Customer have about a 3 foot by 20 foot area to stand it. Apparently the bulk of the business in in carry out. For dine in customers, you order in the front but seat yourself in the back and they bring your meal to you. Behind the counter there is a very large and expansive menu board with a wide variety of food items listed. I knew I was in trouble when the first two times I tried to order off of the menu board, I was told&quot;we no longer carry that&quot;. This is in spite of the fact that their website touts the fact that they have a very expansive menu and will fix just about anything the customer wants. Being 0 for 2, I asked what were the specials and decided on a Pulled Pork Sandwich with an order of French Fries. Went back to the dining area and it&apos;s nice and clean but rather spartan. Decorated in early NASCAR and a big screen TV tuned to SPEED. In about 5 minutes one of the three young ladies behind the counter came back and told me there was going to be a delay on my meal because the had to warm them meat. Sounds odd for what is suppose to be a special. Another 5 - 10 minutes my sandwich finally arrived. Nice looking on the outside but one of the worst if not the worst Pulled Pork Sandwiches I have ever eaten. Dominate taste was not the meat but the so called sauce they had on it. Only thing you could taste was the molassas in the sauce. Not contrast to the meat at all. Right in the middle of sandwich was a very large piece of fat that should have been tirmmed out prior to serving. On high point was the French Fries. They were the best French Fries I have had lately. One other point is that I never did get the drink that was suppose to come with the meal. The place is nice and clean, the young ladies could not have been nicer or more friendly. Unfortunately these ladies have been dealt a loosing hand with an ever changing menu where a very large number of the items listed are no longer available and the qualtiy of the food is just not there. This brings us to value. The price for the combo was near the upper end for what other restauants in the area get for the same thing and had the quality been there, it would have been worth it. As it is, I don&apos;t think you get much value for your money considering the qualtiy of the food and I would not recommend this place to any of my friends.
