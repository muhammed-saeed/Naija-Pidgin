This area is known for brand name shops and way too much advertising. I was pleased to see a Mom and Pop ice cream store. The prices are very good and the food is much fresher than any of the chain junk around.

I&apos;ve been going to Gabel&apos;s for over 50 years! It&apos;s not a chain...a local piece of history.
The current owner has really stepped it up. Good, fast food and good soft and hard ice cream. It&apos;s a place you can take the family to and create great memories. We used to get the monster 1 Qt. Chocolate Malt for $0.85... More

This is a seasonal restaurant opened in the warmer months. People love driving their hotrods here for refreshments on weekend evenings. The food is fresh. Partial to the gyros and hotdogs.

We&apos;re not familiar to the area as it&apos;s our first time to be in the Poconos (we&apos;re from the city). Driving by Anchor Drive, it&apos;s pretty depressing since we&apos;re used to a gazillion restaurants lining down main streets. We were sort of wondering where we&apos;d be eating dinner for the night because the food places were so unfamiliar, and as... More
