i went to the doctor and later found out that i didn&apos;t have insurance anymore. no one told me that my insureance was up and by then it was too late. I am making small payments to Kaiser but they said if i don&apos;t set up a payment plan with them they were going to send me to collections.                 Reason for Reporting

 Absolutely, if you failed to pay the required premiums to maintain coverage they can cancel your coverage, but they will have likely provided coverage for some period of time that they did not receive payment for. You are under a contractual obligation to pay the past due amount even after they cancelled you and if you have not reached an agreed upon payment plan, they are well within their rights to send you to collections. Usually it is in their best interest to agree on just about any payment plan as collection agencies usually only pay pennies on the dollar for what you owe. Call them up and see what they will agree to.

 your only defense is to state you will continue to make the small payments on a regular basis just like before.

but if they want to send you to collections, you will continue to make these small payments to them.

my understanding is that the collection agencies buy these for pennies on the dollar and if you send to them, they collect more than you will if i just pay you direct.

they will most likely argue that this might be put on your credit report and you can state that you would not like that, but at this point i am paying you the most i can afford.

with the economy as it is and many people getting unemployed and losing health insurance, there will be a lot more people unable to pay for getting health care in the near future.

so, at least you are paying something, even if it is not what they want, but the alternative is to just not pay anything at all and let them sue you.

you might want to try some of these answers and see if it works.

good luck

 Yes. They are under no obligation to accept any payments, or honor any payment plan they did not agree to.

 Yes, they can still send you to collections if you&apos;re making&quot;small&quot;payments. The rumor that you can send $5-$10 a month just to avoid being sent to collections is completely false.

If you want to avoid getting sent to collections, you can try negotiating a payment plan with the insurance company that they agree with. (Versus just sending in a small amount you determine on your own.)

They will likely try to negotiate payments that will pay off the entire debt within 6 months to a year. If that won&apos;t be affordable for you, then they have every right to sell your debt to a collection agency.

 That doesn&apos;t make sense. Normally if you&apos;re not paying the insurance company they just drop you. They don&apos;t take small payments.

 You are paying your insuance company? Are you sure that you don&apos;t mean a provider? Why would you pay an insurance company anything other than premiums?
