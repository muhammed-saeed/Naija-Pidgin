 Top 10 Quick Breakfast Ideas 

Between last night&apos;s dinner and this morning&apos;s lunch, a breakfast is the perfect way to keep your stomach satisfied and full. But that doesn&apos;t mean you head straight to a breakfast place or your favorite fast food restaurant. No; that in fact is a big no-no. Of course, there are various healthy breakfast options on the go, to work and/or school but that&apos;s what we need to stay away from. So for a fast and nutritious morning, here are the top 10 breakfast ideas for you to try.

 Healthy Omelets 
Make a delicious omelet with turkey slices or soy bacon. Take 1 egg along with 2 egg whites, 2 slices of your choice of meat, and a cup of assorted vegetables (onions, peppers, broccoli). Prepare the omelet in little bit of olive oil and pair it with whole-wheat toast and a glass of fresh orange juice. An excellent start to your morning.

 Breakfast Parfait 
Make your own breakfast parfait. For this, you&apos;ll need low-fat plain yogurt or soy yogurt, granola (you can add almonds and walnuts instead), unsweetened cornflakes, and fresh berries. Make layers with all the ingredients and much away. It&apos;s fast, easy, and definitely delicious. Everyone in your home, even the kids will love this.

 Milk and Cereal 
Try the classic milk and cereal mix, but with a twist. In a bowl, mix high fiber, low sugar cereal with 2% or skim milk. To try something unique, you can even add almond milk to the cereal. And if you&apos;re a fan of fresh fruits in the cereal, then go ahead, add fresh berries, bananas, or even raisins in.

 Scrambled Tofu 
If you love scrambled eggs but want a little variation for breakfast, then how about having scrambled tofu. Take scrambled tofu and add onions, peppers, and more vegetables of your choice. For flavor, add garlic salt, black pepper, and a bit of soy sauce. Have the scrambled tofu with whole-wheat toast and a glass of mixed fruit juice.

 Breakfast Burrito 
How about a healthy burrito for breakfast? I knew you&apos;d like the idea. Make burritos with whole wheat tortilla, scrambled eggs or scrambled tofu, low-fat cheese, and vegetables. To spice up the burrito, add some salsa to it. If you have time in the morning (Sunday or any other holiday), you can even ask the kids to help out and make their own burritos. Oh and don&apos;t forget your glass of fresh fruit juice.

 Tasty Oats 
Let&apos;s cook oats. But this isn&apos;t going to be just any oats; we&apos;ve put a little spin on it. Take raisins, dried cranberries, soy milk, and slices of bananas in a bowl. Cook oats and mix everything together. This hot and healthy breakfast is just what you need. Wash everything down with 100% apple juice.

Do you fancy a bagel in the morning? Then here&apos;s an idea. Take a whole-wheat bagel and top it with reduced fat cottage cheese or almond butter and slices of apple. Have the bagel with a bowl of fruit salad (apples, pears, berries, bananas) and a cup of herbal tea or orange juice.

 Pancakes and Waffles 
If you think we&apos;ve forgotten about pancakes and waffles, think again. Make your favorite pancakes and waffles with half all-purpose flour and half whole-wheat flour. Add oats, ground flax seed, berries, or oat bran for flavor and nutrition. Eat your pancakes and waffles with 2% or almond milk.

 French Toast 
Here&apos;s another yummy breakfast idea. Prepare the French toast with whole-grain bread and an egg mixed with fat-free milk, vanilla, and cinnamon powder. Try your French toast with a cup of herbal tea or fresh fruit juice.

 Smoothies 
Last, but certainly not the least, a breakfast smoothie. Mix a cup of fresh fruit with soy or low-fat milk. To sweeten the smoothie, you can add Splenda or honey. Blend the ingredients and have the smoothie on-the-go. This is one of the best high protein breakfast ideas for you and your family.
