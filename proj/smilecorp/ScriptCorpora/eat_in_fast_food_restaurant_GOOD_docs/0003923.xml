French fries up and down

The students will get hands-on practice working with patterns and translating them to numerical sequences. This lesson reaches visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners all at the same time.

 &quot;Chips&quot; ahoy! : This lesson will help children recognize, continue, and create number patterns, as well as find the rules for the patterns. The activities progress from concrete to semi-concrete to abstract. Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! : Using chocolate as a theme, students will become involved in reading, writing, math, word study/spelling and other developmentally appropriate (integrated) activities. The unit includes centers for the classroom along with whole group activities. Dinosaur math : The children will be involved in several different activities (graphing, sorting and classifying, patterning) rotating to each station during the lesson.

Learning outcomes

The student will:

 use manipulatives to demonstrate understanding of patterns and numerical sequences. visualize, hear, and construct numerical patterns using objects. record his or her responses and continue a numerical pattern. develop his or her own numerical pattern at the conclusion of the lesson. 

Teacher planning

Time required for lesson

1 hour

Materials/resources

 French Fry Containers for each child (a local fast food restaurant was kind enough to donate these--but if this isn’t possible, you can fashion one from a sheet of construction paper and some staples). small craft sticks, separated into groups of thirty for each child black ink pens or fine markers pencil and paper chalkboard/whiteboard for teacher (and writing tool) 

Pre-activities

The students should have a basic understanding of picture patterns and patterns in the environment (ie: AAB AAB AAB) and be able to continue such patterns given an initial sequence (ie: complete this pattern: ABB ABB ABB A__).

The students should also have some experience estimating, grouping objects to count them, and possibly with dividing sets into halves in order to use this lesson both as a review and as an introduction to new information.

Activities

 Place 30 craft sticks into each french fry container, and distribute the“fries”to each child. Tell the children that today they are going to pretend using these sticks that they have a large order of fries in front of them. Ask each child to estimate about how many fries they think they have in their order. Record some of their ideas on the board for comparison discussion. Ask the children to then group their fries into groups of three, then four, then five to count them and see how many are actually there (each child should have 30). Once everyone has counted, ask if anyone can determine how many fries would be in HALF an order of fries. Allow discussion and circulate during this problem-solving to facilitate. After discussion of HALF, ask the children to number each of their fries at the very top of the flat surface, so that if they are all lined up next to each other, the numbers are all in a straight line. Distribute black pens or markers, and help the children get started. Collect the pens. After they have numbered their fries, allow the children a few minutes to play with and manipulate their fries; they will be ready to listen for directions after this experience. In about 5 minutes, call their attention to their fries, and make sure each child has their own fries, numbered from one to thirty. Ask the children to line up their fries, flat on their desks so that the numbers are all in a line in order from one to thirty. Tell the children that today, they are going to use their french fries to make patterns. Remind them that they have had some experience using patterns and continuing patterns before, but today they will get a chance to see what they look like and sound like using NUMBERS. Ask the children to slide up these fries (and ONLY these fries): #2,#4,#6 so that these fries are slightly raised and their numbers are above the rest of the line of fries. Ask the children if they can continue this number pattern with their fries on their desks through thirty. Circulate during this time and check for understanding. When all have completed the pattern, read the pattern aloud together a few times. Some students will learn more from seeing the numbers sticking up, while others will hear a rhythm and remember from hearing the pattern, so include this step each time you construct a pattern. Try another pattern (ie: #1,#4,#7,_,_,_) and ask the children to continue it using their fries. Circulate, check for understanding, and read it aloud together. Try a more complex pattern (ie: #1,#3,#6,#10) and ask the children to try to continue the pattern with their fries. Circulate, check, and read it aloud together. Write several (5 or so) patterns on the board and allow the children to practice independently and record their results on paper for assessment. Ask the children to make up their own pattern using their fries, record it on their paper, and turn it in for you to continue. 

Assessment

The teacher will use anecdotal records, observation, and written work to measure success during this lesson.

Comments

This lesson is one of five that I used in a week-long mini unit using a restaurant theme in math and language arts. Other ideas included are: creating a menu, using a decimal point in money amounts, cooking, measuring liquids, temperature, and giving change. Bon appetit!
