The Top 20 Worst Fast Foods and Restaurant Foods in the USA – Eat at Your Own Risk

 Add this recipe to ZipList! 
 

Ever wonder just how bad that meal is from your favorite restaurant or fast food joint is? Well, I think you’ll be in for a real surprise. Based on primarily calories and fat grams, some of these nutritional statistics are absolutely horrifying. Whether you are dieting or just trying to maintain good health, these food choices are definite no-no’s. No wonder why America is the fattest country in the world. Even though I knew that a lot of these foods were not diet friendly, and by no means a healthy meal, I must admit that my jaw hit the floor after reading a few of these nutrition facts. Eat at your own risk.

There are a few hidden gems though…“reasonable treats”if you will. I put together a list of some meals under 10 points from the major fast food chains if you click on my name. They definitely aren’t the numbered combos that you’re used to though.

I wanted to try the some“Famous Bread Pudding”from Famous Dave BBQ and I’m so glad I didn’t! One serving of bread pudding is 1,700 calories and 99 g fat! That is just nasty!
I think that all restaurants should be required to list their nutrition information on the menu.

Holy Crap! Worse than I imagined!
 Kelley 
I thought so too (turkey burger) I easily would have ordered that!
 Anne 
This is why I hope it becomes a requirement to show nutritional information on menus. What restaurant-goer would think a turkey burger (like #17) would be so bad for you?
