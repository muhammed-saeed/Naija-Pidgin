My Way by Ted Kraus 

In the last&quot;My Way,&quot;I mentioned the death of a personal
friend and explained this was not a common practice for&quot;us&quot;to report.
Unfortunately, I have to break our&quot;rule&quot;again and comment on the passing of
Fred Margosian, one of the kindest people Ive ever met. (Ann refers to him as the
sweetest person she knows, I just hate using sweet to describe a guy, it must be me). I
always enjoyed our chats/bull sessions together and will miss being his company. Besides
being a great person, Fred was one of the movie theatersreal experts and pioneers.

Geoff Levy, one of his closest friends and partner said,&quot;we had
him a year longer than we thought,&quot;so I guess thats the positive view of
losing someone youve become close with. But the best quote I can take from Geoff is,&quot;no one ever disconnected themselves from Fred, once they met him, they stayed in
touch forever.&quot;Now thats a true compliment. Im told that Geoff gave an
outstanding eulogy for Fred, it truly came from the heart. Theres a lot of people
who will miss him immensely, Im one ofem. Unfortunately, Im now
entering an age group where the loss of other great people will become more common.

Anyway, going on with less depressing opinions... I was talking to a
friend who is regional mall oriented and he was complaining about business. I asked why,
since the economy cant be any better. He responded that in most of the malls
hes involved with, traffic has been dropping for the last few years (but the
mallssales psf has been remaining constant). Since hes a periphial user, not
a real draw, he lives off traffic and its not there, consequently his business is
hurting. In some cases, traffic is off 25% over the past three to four years.

I repeated this to another friend whos power center driven and he
agreed with the assessment. He mentioned the Internet and an economy with virtually no
unemployment as the culprits. With a full employment, retailers who just pay a shade more
than minimum wage only can attract the dredge of the employment population, therefore the
shopping experience is detrimental for the shopper. If youre going to be treated
rudely by a&quot;salesperson,&quot;why not shop elsewhere? Or maybe even no where.

Talking of dropping traffic, every time I speak to someone involved in
the outlet industry I get the feeling Im talking to someone ready to take&quot;the
pipe.&quot;Lots of developers are trying to bail out or at least minimize the
exposure of being an outlet developer. Konover Property Trust , which before its
merger/acquisition was an outlet developer, sold its Factory Stores of America Outlet
Centers in Carrollton, KY. The developers public statement for the sale was they
sell off properties with limited growth potential; well if thats true, I think they
may be selling off all of their outlet centers. In the same vein, Benderson Development bought the Sarasota Outlet Center and will probably turn it into a&quot;big
box&quot;center. So, another outlet center&quot;bites the dust.&quot;

Changing demographics and shopping habits have limited the time the
consumer has or is willing to spend shopping, which is why entertainment projects have
become so popular (developers have a need to develop, they dont care what, just letem build). Add to this the fact that outlet centers rarely offer value and most
conventional retailers treat their customers poorly and you have a market in decline, at
least for the moment. Shopping used to be fun, its now a chore. Many developers and
retailers think by creating a Disney wonderland, the&quot;excitement&quot;will come
back, but they keep forgetting the fundamentals of consumer satisfaction and value.

Even the new concepts in entertainment are struggling to survive.
Disney, who should be in a great position to take advantage of this new&quot;wave of
retailing,&quot;came out with Disney Quest and is already repositioning the
concept because its not making it; many theme restaurants such as Planet
Hollywood , are failing and the movie theater industry is beginning to rethink their
expansion plans. Now, dont get me wrong, what I just said doesnt mean the
world is coming to an end, malls are doomed and entertainment centers have to fail, it
means were living through the most exhausting, thrilling and threatening times in
retail real estate history.

Ann and I received a call late one night at the office from a developer
building a 400,000 sq.ft. entertainment center. He wanted to know if there were any
entertainment center experts we could recommend. I responded before Ann and said,&quot;There arent any and anyone who says he is either is a liar or a fool. The
industry is being created as we speak.&quot;Ann added that while she wasnt around
then, the entertainment industry appears to be in the same position as regional mall
development was 25 to 30 years ago, with everyone shooting from the hip. I agree.

Think about it, while it hasnt become common yet, it isnt
uncommon for malls to be demalled or totally demolished, outlet centers are being
converted to other uses and there are more 80% vacant retail projects today than ever
before, even with the economy expanding. The whole fiber of our society is changing and
while developers and retailers are aware of this change, they dont know how to
handle it (nor do they understand the changes, yet, but I have confidence they
will, some day).

Will people be shopping Wal*Mart and Home Depot in 10
years, Id bet yes. Is the Internet a&quot;threat&quot;to them, yes. Will the
consumer shop outlet centers in 10 years; probably not. Im willing to bet there will
be less true outlet centers in 10 years than we have today. I think the future is a
combination of outlet, entertainment and conventional retailing housed in the same
complex; with the majority of retailers having a Web site for the consumer to shop.
Its only logical for the conventional retailer to be their own competition on-line.

Convenience centers will still be around, probably in similar shape as
they are today, less affected by changes than anyone else. While there will be on-line
shopping for the supermarket, there will always be a need for the local&quot;real&quot;stores such as dry cleaners, liquor stores, pizza, etc.

On a different note, its getting to be that time of year again
when all thoughts begin to turn towards Vegas and while its still two months off, Im
willing to bet on another record year for attendance. The crowds will be bigger, more
enthusiastic and more confused than ever. The reason for confusion is because of the
convention centers expansion. Theres going to be more exhibitors than in the
past and many of the exhibitors will be in new locations, so plan on needing more time
than you did last year, not only to visit with all the new exhibitors, but to find some of
the old ones who relocated. I highly suggest you confirm your hotel and travel
arrangements now . Id also recommend you add a day to your schedule, it should
be a great show.

Last thought (at least for now)... Ive spoken to three retailers
today and all bragged how they were cutting their loses and will break even next year; the
turnaround (if there is one) took anywhere from three to five years. When I was young and
taking Business 101 in college, I was taught that making a profit was how you judged
success. Today it seems that success is measured by how much you lose; god has the world
changed in 30 years.

 Whos Opening&amp;Where 
 
Ralphs Grocery Company (310-884-2875) is developing a 50,254
sq.ft. Food 4 Less supermarket at the intersection of Fries Avenue and Anaheim
Street in Wilmington, CA. An August 1999 opening is planned. The company recently opened a
58,000 sq.ft. Ralphs Marketplace at Long Beach Towne Square in Long
Beach, CA. In addition to groceries, the store carries small appliances, gardening
supplies, office supplies, portable stereo systems and pet supplies. There is also a

Costco Companies Inc. (425-313-6360), which opened stores in

Edison Co. and plans to convert it into its warehouse format. Terms of the Northbrook
deal were not released. The company remains interested in acquiring additional sites in
the Chicago market.
 
Safeway (925-467-3000) recently signed a contract to purchase the
former Ortega Middle School in Alamosa, CO for $805,000. Safeway plans to develop a
supermarket on the site. However, no building can occur until a lawsuit filed by residents
of the area against Safeway, the school district, the city council and the city of Alamosa
is resolved. In the suit, the residents are challenging the change in use of the property.
If the court rules in favor of the sale, the district will have 60 days to turn the site
over to Safeway. School board members said that the lawsuit is costing taxpayers since
proceeds from the sale could be used in a refinancing of the bonds on the new high school.
Lowered interest rates would amount to a $700,000 saving to taxpayers over the next 16
years if the bonds could be refinanced and the district could use $600,000 from the sale
to reduce the payment time in the bonds.

 Shopping Center Management Becoming More Sophisticated 
 
by Alan Alexander, SCSM, CPM 

Over the past several years we have seen the consolidation of both
anchor tenants and major developer/owners of shopping center. Just prior to this we saw
the major influence of the institutional investors on the management practices in the
shopping center field. In recent years we have seen a flurry of shopping center purchases,
some at CAP rates that question the sophistication of the analysis behind them.

While we have done a good job of getting over the last major recession,
competition is still very keen and the successful shopping center operators are
increasingly more sophisticated in their approach to the fundamentals of our business. One
would expect to see the most sophisticated management on the regional and super regional
level, but there is the need for this in depth management at all levels of shopping
centers. Three major areas come to mind:
 
Market Information: Our markets are changing rapidly and we must be
fully aware of those changes and make every effort to see that our tenant mix is the best
it can possibly be to meet the needs of this market. Smaller centers must be positioned
properly in their market in order to maximize the tenant sales and therefore the rents and
lease terms for the shopping center owner. We must be aware of the aging population in our
trade area and the demands that this creates in our centers. The aging population is now
demanding selection and service and is less concerned with the price. Even when shopping
for price, the older customer today demands a higher level of ambiance in the shopping
center. We are seeing major changes in the ethnic mix in the trade areas of our centers.
In the Los Angeles, CA area the Hispanic population represents 25% of the market and is
growing. Any shopping center that chooses to ignore this population is going to miss out
on a tremendous amount of sales.
 
Tenant Mix: Along with our changing markets we are finding that we
have to change our tenant mix to meet that market. We are best served when our tenant mix
reflects the needs of our buying public. Starbucks is a great example of recognizing
and/or creating a need in the mind of the public and packaging it in such a way as to make
it a very popular, and profitable, concept. It is not necessary to pay $2.50 for a cup of
coffee, but Starbucks has created an atmosphere and upscale product line that has appealed
to the more affluent customer.

It is no longer enough to have a store selling womens wear, but
we must be aware of who our customer really is and what brands they are buying. With that
information we make sure that our center has the specific goods to satisfy those needs.

We went through a period of time, especially in our smaller shopping
centers that we put little emphasis on getting the merchants on percentage rents. That era
has passed as we need those sales figures to help analyze our shopping center, even if it
doesnt mean any percentage rental income.

Tenant sales are much more carefully analyzed than at any time in the
past. We all fully understand that our success depends on the success of our merchants in
the long run. We carefully analyze each individual tenants sales, we look at
specific categories of merchandise, we analyze the sales in specific wings of the shopping
center, in shops facing in a given direction and in shops of specific sizes. We carefully
analyze the make up of our customer base and compare that to the shops they frequent in
the mall and come up with an index to see how that category is doing relative to the
whole. If a portion of the population represents, say 19.5% of our customer base, but the
sales in that area represent only 15% of our sales, we want to see why. Maybe we are
marketing to the wrong population or, maybe we are not doing a very good job of marketing
to that specific customer group.
 
Management Reporting: The paper work of management has become
extremely sophisticated. Budgets in our better managed shopping centers have been a staple
for years. However, in recent years the annual budget has become a full blown management
plan rather than a three to five page budget of the major income and expenses of our
shopping center. The budgeting process now starts with a market survey, an analysis of the
competition, a look at the local infrastructure and a study of the economic conditions in
the market place. We have separate schedules on leasing, tenant improvements, capital
items, security, marketing, common area expenses, tax management, insurance allocations,
management costs and separate schedules for various items of extraordinary income items.
This budget is then compared to the previous years budget and actual figures are
analyzed to be sure that the projections appear to be reasonable given the market
conditions.

Once this is all accomplished, the monthly management reports track
every aspect of the shopping center operation. It is not enough for the manager to report
the figures, but must provide a carefully thought out analysis with a narrative to the
owners telling them what it all means and how it will impact upcoming issues in the
shopping center. The process today is very pro active rather than reacting to what has
been.

Other reports will include leasing activity. Part of the leasing report
will contain a listing of all lease expirations by month and year to see if there are any
opportunities for major changes or the possibility that a group of merchants may have
similar expirations and wind up causing a renewal problem for the center owners.
Additionally, the owners want to know the status of leasing for vacant units. Once a
prospective deal is introduced it will be tracked until the lease is signed or the deal is
lost.

The sophisticated manager of shopping centers of all sizes is more
fully informed today that at any time in the past. It is not enough to keep the center
clean and the rent collected. We must be fully aware of all of the elements that
contribute to a successful shopping center and be anticipating those areas where we can
make a difference with the proper decisions that will allow us to maximize our position
within those market parameters. This author has heard managers indicate that the monthly
management reports are not much good for planning because they are after the fact. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The well constructed management report provides the
information as to what has been so one can properly plan for what is to be. These reports
are as important to the successful shopping center as is the market survey and the well
planned tenant mix.

There is not doubt that management, as well as all of the other phases
of shopping center operations has become much more sophisticated. While it is very
important today in our competitive market, it will become critical with the next slow down
in the economy where the competition will still be fierce, but the manager will also be
facing poor economic times which we have been fortunate in not seeing in many years.

To the Editor:

Just a quick note to introduce myself to you as I will be the new real
estate director at Chicos as of March 1, 1999. We deeply appreciate the exposure in
your last issue but would caution you a bit about the number of new stores we will do this
year. The number that was printed was 40 new stores and the official word is that we will
grow stores about 15% from 162 locations. That would be 24 stores. It is not to say that
someone did not give you the 40 number, just to say that the official number for now is
about 24.

There is great excitement here at Chicos as we led the country
last year in comp sales with our store average exceeding 30%! The clothing line is much
improved and a lot of new management talent is now in place. We hope you will share our
optimism. Please call on me if there is any way that I can be of help to you.

 Tenants Settle Suit 

Eleven local tenants at Town Center Plaza in Leawood, KS
recently settled a lawsuit with the owners. The tenants, Kansas Sampler, Blue Chip
Cookies, The Coffee Beanery, Han Shin Japanese Steak House, The Learning Tree, The Leather
Furniture Co., Mazzarese Fine Jewelers, Natural Way, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory,
Swim Quik and M. Taylor , filed the suit last March complaining that their taxes
and fees were nearly triple what they had been told they would be. The lawsuit said the
tenants were told by center representatives when they signed leases that their annual tax
bills would be $1.50 to $3 psf of leased space. Their 1997 tax bills ended up being three
times that amount. The tenants1998 tax payments were $7 and $8 psf, even after Town
Center Plaza, which opened in 1996, got its 1997 valuation reduced to $53.5 million from
$60.4 million. That was expected to reduce the centers tax bill by about $200,000.
The tenantssuit said that it was not explained that Jacobsons , the
centers anchor, would pay less tax per square foot than the centers specialty
stores. Typically, anchor stores get rent and often CAM reduction discounts because they
draw customers for shopping centers. However, they usually make contributions to CAM and
pay their pro rata share of taxes. The tenants, which were never trying to break their
leases, wanted their monthly costs reduced to be in line with what they had been told.
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
