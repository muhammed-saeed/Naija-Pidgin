Can someone help me name my food business?
 My biggest money maker will be catering. i will also run a vegetable stand in the summer. I will sell my home canned products from my restaurant. I want to have a name that involves everything i do. I have ten acres of land i can farm for the vegetable stand and the restaurant will only be a kitchen to do caterings and run my farm stand. I also want to smoke pork but and briskets and sell them to order. can some one give me some great ideas or a website to look at that will help me.

 There are lots of good ideas for names that have been listed.
I would caution you to start your business focusing on doing a few things well rather than attempting to do all things.
If you begin with the farm stand and have some of your BBQ going you will have people stopping to sample both. The catering can branch from there. Possibly offer to do picnics, pig roasts and the like. The catering will take off from there.
Good luck the food service industry can be a hard one to succeed in.
