 Best Answer - Chosen by Voters
 Positions at fast food restaurants are considered cashier, to-go, food handler, assistant manager, manager and so on up to regionals and CFO&apos;s :)

The best advice I received when I was younger and filling out applications was to put AVAILABLE in the position slot and NEGOTIABLE in the pay rate slot (this way you can be offered the position and be paid what everyone else is being paid in that position.

It gives you more room to decide once they offer you the job
Hope that helped

 Fast food restaurant

Front Counter or a cashier: Greet customer, verify customer orders, handle money

Team Leader or Hospitality Leader: Lead the team by doing what is expected of you or more and encouraging everyone

Drive-Thru: Greet individuals on the run, take orders, need to be fast and proficient handling money

Cook: stay on the grill serving hot food

Management: To make sure production is active and food is quality, officiate the whole restaurant to make sure it operate smoothly

I hope this help...best wishes
