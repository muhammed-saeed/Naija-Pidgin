 I&apos;ve been around these boards for quite some time, and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever posted here in this forum.

I have read many posts, and so many of them seem to be about folks who are&quot;overwhelmed&quot;or&quot;unhappy&quot;because of their limited choices on this plan. I used to feel that way until I got really creative with my cooking. 

I wonder if there is any way I can help, and hopefully build some kind of friendships along the way??!!

I&apos;ve lost 70 pounds on this plan and if I stay on the plan as prescribed (substituting the recommended vegetarian options for my protein) I have NEVER stalled (unless of course, I went off of the plan completely.) I lost my weight in&quot;chunks&quot;. I maintained a 50 pound weight loss for years and years - this shows that the weight loss that happens on this plan is SUSTAINABLE. Whoohoo! What is even more exciting is that while BMOS says beans and tofu may slow our loss, that hasn&apos;t happened to me. I do not know what the experience of others will be, but I wanted to offer my story has HOPE :)

I will not lie to you - it&apos;s been very challenging at times, and there were days where I thought If I had to eat beans and rice (again) I&apos;d cry, but it was only because I had such a deep relationship with food and I wasn&apos;t fully ready to deal with that. I have dealt with that, and every day I am further away from that kind of thinking. One small example is that I now meet people for coffee and tea instead of dinner. That was UNTHINKABLE for me before.

I hope you all continue on this path and I welcome you to send me messages or post here so that I can share my ideas or ways I&apos;ve overcome some&quot;perceived obstacles&quot;about not choosing to eat meat on this plan.

YOU CAN DO THIS :) I&apos;ve lost another 11 pounds in the last week and a half - and I&apos;m positive that this is the year I&quot;ll meet my goal. I just really had to want this as much as I said I wanted it, and follow through.

Good luck!

  Hi Emily and all vegetarians using this program. 

     I am also having tremendous success on this plan. The inches are just melting away. I am wearing clothing I haven&apos;t worn in years, AND, it is looser now than 1 week ago. I am down to a size 6/8, from a 10/12 about a month ago!  
   I actually began losing weight doing a cleanse/fast. Usually I lose weight and then begin putting it back on when I start eating again. This time was different, as I transitioned right into this program. I NEVER put back any weight on and then just continued losing pounds, and mostly inches, over the weeks that followed. I have lost a total of over 30 pounds and gone from a size 14/16 down to a 6/8. All my small clothes fit me except the size 2/4s. It is like having a new wardrobe again, but I still have 20 or so pounds I want to lose. All this was done with only just beginning to walk one week ago. I have done only one workout, and now look forward to seeing the results in the weeks to come with establishing a regular exercise routine.
  This program works so well, that even though I went on vacation I continued to follow the eating routine and continued to lose weight!  I don&apos;t get on the scale very often, as it has tended to derail me in the past any time I had a little&quot;blip&quot;up, so instead, I just go on how the clothes fit. I am so pleased as the fat seems to be melting off! Yeah, I am so grateful for this program!
  Vegetarians have every bit as good a chance as the meat eaters to succeed here. The results will knock your socks off!

 Hi Lorri,

I knew there were more of us out there! Great to hear of your success :) I just get so excited to hear of other folk&apos;s success. It&apos;s very motivating. Hopefully we&apos;ll hear from more and more! Continued success - and here&apos;s to us taking off EVEN MORE weight this week. (BTW, I did a raw food cleanse before restarting this, now that was an experience!) -- Amylee     [more] [less] Report this post  |  Post #3

Hi Amylee and Lorri, I am in Tucson...and I just reported your successes to my husband, to let him know that I am going for it too! It is a bit challenging to cook differently for the both of us, but I am up for the challenge and am creative in the kitchen. We eat a low acid diet which has helped his gastric reflux...no onions and garlic for him, although I am finding I HAVE to use them for flavor...besides I love garlic and missed it.  I will find a way to put the two together.

Just made chana dal (yellow lentils) baked falafal with rice and a tasty roasted eggplant/tomato/green onion sauce to go on top. Served with a great salad. He got to have some yogurt raita with his since he is not on the plan. Delicious! 


Freezing a lot for easy to grab lunches (I am a teacher) and loving my food processor!

By the way, I found that tofu products are less expensive in the Oriental food section of my fav international grocery. And they do not have the added salt that hipster baked tofu has for instance. Only about 8 feet away, the delicious compressed Chinese tofu was 12 oz for $2.19 rather than the baked version I used to buy for about double. 

Would love the camaraderie! All the best, Cath

 Glad to hear such good things! 

  I&apos;m almost to the point to where if I look at food of any sort I want to cry... It is taking me almost 30 minutes to finish some of these meals!  

  But, it works... and its hard to argue with results. I have also found that I am not having too many delays in weight loss with tofu either... My only delays have been when I have gone off the plan... say, for an entire weekend. I work crazy schedules on the weekends and I haven&apos;t quite figured out how to cook/store/eat on my days that I&apos;m up and going for almost 24 hours... 

  So... it&apos;s Friday night, I just worked 8 hours... took a 3 hour nap and am getting ready to head to work again for a 10 hour shift then the gym! Wish me luck... This is when my willpower is at its worst... Oh yeah, and a little TMI but... Aunt Flo should be visiting in about a week... So - Chocolate and Salt are whispering at me from dark corners (which is odd... since neither item is even in my home!) but I&apos;m sure you get what I&apos;m trying to say! 

 Hopefully we can keep this thread going.... I&apos;ve been lurking - but... I need the support, so I figured it was time to put myself out there! 

 Have a great night all!

  Hi Tara Lynn- 

 Thanks for your post. It did take me some time to get into a routine. I don&apos;t stick to the plan fully, as vegetarians we can&apos;t any way. I first began making stir fry veggies and 2 egg whites for breakfast, followed by 1/2 cup of fresh berries. I do home health care and cook breakfast for an elderly man four mornings a week, so this fit right in. The only thing is, it was taking me so long to prepare my food, I wasn&apos;t really sitting down to eat with him and he missed that! But I still did it for about a month that way. I would cook enough to save half for my snack and not need to prepare any more food for that 2nd meal of the day. I lost weight, but mostly inches (which is what really matters any way!)  

 But now I am often boiling a bunch of eggs and having 3 egg-whites with 1/2 grapefruit for breakfast and some veggie slices with berries for my snack. I now do the stir-fry for lunch and/or dinner meals and snacks. Also, I have started doing a protein bar once a day as a meal replacement. I will start doing one meal a day as a protein smoothie. For me and for my lifestyle, I would rather have a little slower weight loss (having already lost 30 pounds, mostly from a cleanse that I did immediately prior to beginning this program) and have me enjoy the food and be able to continue on with these lifestyle changes over the long-haul. This is more important to me than being perfect on the plan and getting tired of the taste of food. I realize this is a bit unorthodox, but so far, it is so much better than how I used to eat. Now that I am not having any dairy, bread, processed foods, or desserts, everything is coming into better balance for me. Oh... I also discovered that I love to eat the roasted seaweed called NORI. You can buy it in sheets in the health food stores and actually, most grocery stores. It is only 10 calories per sheet, has protein, no sugar and no fat. I find them tasty snacks and can munch on them guilt-free. They also have no sodium added. They may have some sodium, coming from salt water, but still, it is a wonderful help to me to keep them on hand. I hope this helps you. Please let me know.  

 Lorri

 Well... Good Morning all... Thought I would check in before I went to bed... 

  My meals are getting better... I&apos;m perfect on plan Sunday evenings (when I wake up at 2) through Friday till Mid-Afternoon snack... It is after that time that my schedule is a mess but... so far, I am well on my way to a perfect weekend... well, almost... I had to throw an extra meal in this morning before I went to the gym (Brown rice, smashed banana and chocolate protein powder) since I was going to be there at least an hour and a half...  

 On that note - I had the best workout of my life... honestly. New personal record! I&apos;m sooo excited. I had to drag myself out of there cause I didn&apos;t want my excitement to cause me to overdo it and then I&apos;d be back where I started. 

  I tried the protein bar thing... The ones that were recommended somewhere on here... and they were just too big of a temptation away from real food... They were like a candy bar... so... I&apos;ve decided to say&quot;no&quot;to those.  

 I&apos;m doing a veggie scramble in the mornings... I&apos;ve got a giant bowl of chopped brocolli and spinach in my freezer so its real easy to just scoop out about a half cup or more (depending on what else I&apos;m throwing in there) and toss it into the pan before the eggs and its really fast! Also, what has worked for me is a&quot;yogurt&quot;kinda thing I made with silken tofu and berries (or fresh peaches)... I measured out my portions and blended them up... put them in individual containers in my freezer... so that way I can always just toss one of those bad boys into my lunch bag for a quick snack or breakfast. 

  The one thing I am most excited about is that this eating plan has gotten me nearly off my dairy addiction! I can hardly believe it. So when I&apos;ve reached my goal and can add a few things back into my diet and can delete the egg whites and protein powder (which I never really ate before) I will reach my vegan goal by my 5th anniversary of vegetarianism! 

 Thanks for your suggestions as well! 

  Well... off to sleep... once I check my fridge to make sure I&apos;ve got what I need for tonight!

Hi all,

I have been away from the boards for some time and thought I would check this board out for any activity since I am restarting again today. My husband is doing it with me. We did it together 2 years ago and I lost 35 pounds and he lost almost 50. It does work. I just found myself in a rut eating the same foods all the time. My biggest problem is that I travel a lot, sometimes a week at a time. To make a long story short, I ended up going back to the old ways like grabbing something at Taco Bell as I traveled. So, as you might have guessed the weight came back and here I am again determined to get the weight off and keep it off.

I would like to join this thread and help keep it going. I am going to try and do a better job of checking in and posting. If we could share ideas and recipes it would be helpful to all of us and to vegetarians who think it can&apos;t be done.

What are you doing for snacks? That seems to be the hardest meal for me. Before I ate a protein bar for the afternoon snack, but am going to try and not eat those everyday.

Anyone interested in doing a Thanksgiving challenge where we post how much we want to lose by Thanksgiving and then post our loss each week? It keeps us accountable and connected.

I am excited to see other vegetarians active on this board. Keep it up!

Pam

 Welcome back! 

 Ah. The foul temptress that is Taco Bell... I have had many justification battles in my head over that one... and it has been the gateway to several entire off-plan weekends. 7-layer burrito, no cheese, no sour cream sounds sweet and innocent doesn&apos;t it? TB is not my friend... 

  See above my snack strategy... that, and pineapple and pan toasted tofu... Put a few servings together and let the tofu marinate in the pineapple juice... maybe add some chopped ginger... I soo wish I had the willpower for protein bars... They would be so convenient... but, alas...  

  I would totally support a Thanksgiving Challenge - however, I&apos;m not so sure I would participate... I see bad things happening to my progress when I get discouraged about meeting numerical goals... I&apos;m in it for the little steps. But I am totally here to support and encourage! 

 And, an update on my attempted on plan weekend... I failed, but... didn&apos;t cheat! 

 When it came time to eat&quot;dinner&quot;at 6:30 this morning... I just couldn&apos;t do it. I ate my protein, about half a cup of carrots... but no carb... I just couldn&apos;t physically eat it! 

  And I won&apos;t be able to do it today either... Since, I didn&apos;t wake up until 3:30... breakfast now at 4... I don&apos;t work tonight, so will be in bed by 11... not enough hours in the day today to get all my meals in... HUGE step in not cheating though... It&apos;s my 4th weekend and first cheat free... :) 

  And, I&apos;m super excited and motivated today, aside from the super fabo-ness at the gym, I reached 199 today! It&apos;s One-derful... hahaha. Seriously. 

 I haven&apos;t tried on the new slacks I bought for work yet... maybe tomorrow I can slip them on and be a solid 14... not 14+! 

 Hope you all had as fantastic a weekend as I&apos;ve had! We can do this... and the plan works! :) 

  *hugs*

So great to hear from you all...thanks so much for your comraderie...through the ethers. In a pinch, at Taco Bell, one could get a side of rice and a side of beans with a side salad...I mean there is not any other fast food restaurant for us, eh?

I have had luck eating out a couple of times, although it is impossible to go completely saltless since some things are prepared that way. Today for lunch with friends, I ordered grilled veggies (no oil) on top of what was the insides of a burrito, whole beans and rice (skip the cheese/sourcream) with lettuces/greens. The serving size was perfect, yummy.


I am also loving silken tofu blended with frozen strawberries and a bit of stevia for breakfast and morning snack, quick, easy and yogurt like...

For snack/dinner I baked up a crustless pumpkin pie, but made with equal amounts of silken tofu and pure pumpkin purée, lots of spices and stevia to taste. Baked like a regular pumpkin pie as far as temp and timing went. Great! Tasted decadent, but was totally on plan.

I have so far done well, it is not coming off overly fast, but three pounds a week will add up! I have lost ten pounds. It is the next ten that will start to really show, although I feel much better.

I greatly appreciate having all of your notes to urge me on! Thanks so much!

Cath

ps, I love nori too. I bought some like I used to eat in Japan, cut into tiny spaghetti size strips. Great as a rice topper. Found a delicious spice in the middle eastern section of the store called sumac. I used to make it into a tea, gathered wild when I was a kid, because I read that the Native Americans used to use it for the Vitamin C content. It is the red berried sumac, not the poisonous white one. Anyhoo, it is very, very tasty, with a natural salty, lemony flavor.

I am trying to eat more salads, but find it difficult to really like that well without the dressings. This was hard for me the first time on 6WBMO and I ended up having just fresh lemon on my salad. I need to do something different this time. Do any of you have a POP dressing you like that you would share?

Thanks,

Pam

There are MANY recipes for dressings in the Condiments section of the Recipe Exchange. There is even an index at the top so that you can look them up and simply click to a recipe that sounds interesting.

 You are fueling your body every 3 hours, it is unlikely that your body will go into starvation mode.

You can add free food vegetables to any and/or all of your meals. Hunger is a good sign that you body is responding to this way of eating and using up the food in a timely fashion, it does not indicate a problem. As your body continues to adjust to this way of eating you should only get hungry shortly before your next meal.

I&apos;d suggest trying a few protein alternatives, as having some variety tends to yield the best results. Having a smoothie with tofu or protein powder once a day, or a tofu veggie stir-fry, might work well for you. I wouldn&apos;t experiment with too much at once, just one new thing at a time, that way you can quickly see what works and what doesn&apos;t.

   
 P lease 
submit any program related questions to &quot;Associate BMOS Joanna&quot; or &quot;BMOS JP&quot;. Technical questions may be sent to the &quot;Forum 
Admin&quot; account. It was an honored privilege
 to serve this community starting in 2002 giving advice, then working behind 
the scenes managing the online help desk, and for the past 2 years as 
the primary Specialist and Administrator of these forums. Yet, sadly, I will no
 longer be filling those roles. May you each find what you need here, and in yourselves. You&apos;re worth the effort, always.

Hi all

 I just ordered the plan today, and then did a quick internet search to see if it was vegetarian friendly (should have done that first!) and was dismayed to see all the negative comments, BUT THEN I came accross this thread and found that vegetarians can do, so I&apos;m relieved. I will check back when I get my parcel in the mail. Is there a section for vegetarian recipies?

 Thanks!
