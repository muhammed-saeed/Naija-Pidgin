This Happened: Asian Woman Called‘Lady Chinky Eyes’On Papa John’s Receipt
 by James Crugnale | 12:13 am, January 8th, 2012 »101 comments 
 Papa John’s is apologizing after a New York franchise handed a customer a receipt with a racial slur. Minhee Cho had ordered a small pepperoni pie Friday night, when she noticed the offensive missive sprawled on the receipt.



 



Angered by the employee’s racism, Cho tweeted at Papa John’s, sending them a photo of the receipt in question.

“Hey @PapaJohns just FYI my name isn’t ‘lady chinky eyes,’”

The tweet soon went viral and the picture has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times .

Embarrassed by the incident, Papa John’s apologized via Facebook and Twitter:
 
We were extremely concerned to learn of the receipt issue in New York. This act goes against our company values, and we’ve confirmed with the franchisee that this matter was addressed immediately and that the employee is being terminated. We are truly sorry for this customer’s experience.
 
This is the second incident involving Asian-American targeted racism to occur at a Fast Food restaurant in recent weeks. In December, a Chick-fil-A in Irvine, California gave two Asian-American students receipts with the terms“Ching”and“Chong”.

 UPDATE : According to Gothamist’s Ben Yakas , Papa John’s“fired the 16-year-old high school girl who wrote it.” The New York Post notes that employees at the pizza franchise believed the woman overreacted: “I think the lady put it out there just to get some attention—some people like that type of attention,”said a manager.“I truly don’t think it’s fair. It’s been taking up all our time. It’s been very disruptive.”

Well if you type in her name on Google and then hit“images”you will see pictures of two women named Minhee Cho in New York, one a graphic artist and the other an Eye Doctor.  So maybe the clerk from the store was refering to Dr. Cho’s profession on the reciept ?

Um inter-racial tension is when the same race attacks each other. How do you plan on debating people when you don’t even understand concepts like race? Almost painful reading how dumb your response was, lol.

“Inter-racial”is between to different races not the same race.  For example, an“inter-racial”marriage is a marriage between people of different races.“Intra-racial”is within the same race.  I guess liberals aren’t as smart as they think they are.

No, it isn’t. Did you arrive at that conclusion on our intercontinental railroad? 

You’re confusing inter- with intra-. If you’re going to go grammar Nazi, it’s good to be right. Better luck next time, dummy.

Who raised this ignorant and racist worker? What happened?

Aren’t we suppose to be the“melting pot”and welcome people in with open arms? Isn’t that what we stand for in America? Isn’t this what drives people from other countries where this behavior towards one another is  much worse. And yet, we instill the same hatred here towards the different cultures.

We need more education on understanding the different cultures. Racism like this will not help us grow as the country I think we are suppose to be.

Indeed, asians are famous for their multicultural and inviting attitudes toward non-asian outsiders. On the other hand, note the lack of rioting, violence, and looting after the tsunami in Japan. They were all Japanese and felt a familial obligation to one another. But for us, our diversity is our strength! Yeah, right.
 Anonymous 
The left has been nurturing a dynamic of white vs. non-white for decades. So when something like this happens, and it turns out to be a non-white perpetrator, it’s a bitter-sweet moment for them. Of course, when it does happen, and it turns out to have been a white person, it will make the cover of the NY Times.
 Just some Blow Hard… 
I think the lack of looting was more to the fact of 10,000 dead, high radiation levels, and the fact that everything was destroyed or swept out to sea.

Didn’t happen after the Kobe quake either. In fact, I can’t recall, nor am I aware of, any Japanese looting/rioting in the aftermath of any natural disasters this century. If you know anything about the Japanese, any citizen who took advantage of a catastrophe like that to prey on a fellow japanese citizen would bring shame on himself and his family. Not so here in our“I gots mine!”culture.

5100-6200 deaths and all, if not most, roads in and into Kobe were completely destroyed. But what reports do you have of widespread looting after a major earthquake in this country? There was one over twenty years ago in the greater San Fransisco/Oakland area and there were no reports of wide spread looting. As a matter of fact, the only report of looting after a major earthquake in this country happened in 1906 and it was done by US soldiers.
 Just some Blow Hard…

Wow, who raised a judgmental and narrow-minded troll such as you? Nevertheless, to answer your question–we USED to be a melting pot, until the left started the“celebrate diversity”nonsense and insisted on putting people into categories rather than welcome them as Americans. Trust me, most people don’t want to grow into the country you think we should be, but into the one we used to be where we could poke fun at a neighbor and he would zing us right back all in good humor.

We don’t need more education on different cultures. We’ve had quite enough, and it’s why we are in the Balkanized environment we find ourselves in now. We need to rediscover our American culture, the one that makes my Portuguese inlaws cringe when I serve bratwurst with linguine just because I love both and just because I can do so.

Quite true, but no one is where they are because they are forced to be. They choose to be where they are because it’s human nature to want to be with one’s own rather than mingle with strangers all the time. It’s how people relax.

I’m in love with most“lady chinky eyes”. I find them the most beautiful, loyal, nice, sexy, feminine, strong, intelligent girls on the planet. I’ve dated white girls and Asian girls and find white girls OK to talk to but not sexy at all (unless they are models) but good at being friends. Congrats white girls white men are no longer interested in you as sex symbols- you are now considered as MEN. Congratulations. To all the young white girls- don’t worry about a thing. You’ve got plenty of whipped white boys who don’t know what feminism is and expect to be kicked in the balls in order to get a CHANCE to get a date.
