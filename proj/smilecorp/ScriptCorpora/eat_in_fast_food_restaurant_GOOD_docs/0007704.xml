Construction Costs Survey2010

 

Waco, Texas

This is a construction cost survey for typical income properties in Waco, Texas. The cost figures for a suburban area outside a large city are normally 

less than the city by 1% to 8%. Usually, rural areas have even lower construction costs than either suburbs or cities, but not in all cases. Consider this survey to be &quot;napkin-ware;&quot; that is, the kind of figures you jot on a napkin at lunch while discussing a new idea for a real estate project. When it&apos;s time to get serious, you will want to research specific construction cost figures for your project with help from one of the services or books named below.

Contractors, real estate developers, brokers, lenders, investors, and

other real estate professionals speak the construction cost language

of “dollars per square foot.” But how often are the figures you’ve

heard second-hand, third-hand, or outdated? This survey for Waco gives you some current construction costs in order to discuss

real estate projects and make preliminary analyzes.

In doing a survey the problem arises of how to provide generic figures for buildings that vary widely in features, finish, and cost. Of course, there is no easy answer. This dilemma was resolved by providing you with examples. The survey includes many commercial investment properties and several residences. The characteristics for each property were chosen to be typical of its class and quality. The examples are not an average, mean, or norm. They simply represent certain types of property. But to create new ideas and new projects, you have to have something to talk about that

Keep in mind construction costs can be different for areas only an hour or two apart or even close togethersometimes a considerable amount. For instance, in a resort town with high-end homes and retail stores and a limited number of local construction workers, you may find higher construction costs than in an urban area just two hours away. This is contrary to the notion that rural ares have lower construction costs.

Included in the construction costs indicated for Waco are materials, 

labor, connectors to infrastructure, normal site preparation, building permits, insurance, 

architect’s fees, general contractor’s overhead and profit, basic interior finish (space 

improvements), and heating and cooling (except where otherwise noted). Space improvements 

include finished floors, walls, and ceilings as well as normal partitioning and fixtures. For 

some property types the tenant pays for the space improvements.

Not included are land, site development costs, developer’s profit, tap fees, special 

government fees, special district fees, financing expenses, furniture, art, trade fixtures, 

special fixtures or equipment, interior decoration, landscaping, paved and lighted parking, 

signage, and other costs which vary widely between communities or between tenants or which are 

determined by the extraordinary operating strategies of developers.

To refine your construction cost analysis, use an online service such as 

Marshall and Swift, books such as those published by Reed Construction Data in the RS Means 

series, or the Craftsman series of cost manuals. Be sure to use a square foot cost version, not a more detailed version meant to be used by a construction contractor.

When it’s time for precision, only a detailed construction cost analysis of 

your specific project by a construction contractor can provide you with the accuracy you need. 

Ultimately, only a firm bid by a competent and capable construction contractor is reliable to 

support a final decision.
