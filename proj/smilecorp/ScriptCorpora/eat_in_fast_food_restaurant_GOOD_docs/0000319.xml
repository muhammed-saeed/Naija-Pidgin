Speedy service is what a drive-thru is all about. In less than five minutes, a fast-food cashier will have a nice hot combo meal waiting at the window for the customer to pick up. It’s an assembly line in which speed and accuracy are gracefully put to good use. And, when the process is done correctly, everybody leaves happy; the customer has his or her lunch, and the fast food employees made another sale.
 
Etiquette is not exactly the first thing that comes to mind when discussing fast food drive-thru. The interaction between employee and customer is often quick. However, this doesn’t mean that some interaction is not going to take place. In fact, the entire process starts the moment when the costumer drives up to the intercom and places his or her order. Then, it concludes only after the money and food are exchanged at the drive-thru window. There’s plenty of time and opportunity for interaction.

As succinct as this interaction appears, etiquette still needs to be followed. Whether it’s a cordial greeting over the intercom or clarification of the order, appropriate behavior in this situation needs to be practiced. However, drive-thru etiquette also needs to be clarified; there are things the customer and the fast food employees have to do to keep things flowing and harmonious. Here’s a breakdown of the two positions.

EMPLOYEES

Always respect a customer’s reasonable order. If they order a burger and drink, don’t insist on persuading them to get the combo. Maybe there’s something that the customer doesn’t like that goes along with that combo. Even if it’s only a few cents or a dollar more, and it may sound like a great deal, not everybody needs fries or a drink with their order.

Also, don’t make assumptions about the order. If you were confused or not clear about a request, ask the customer to clarify. Don’t make assumptions; be precise so the delivery is as flawless as possible.

Be prepared for unusual orders. It’s easy to take orders from people wanting the combo meals. When somebody gets a la carte, don’t sound dumbfounded or shocked (yes, this happens quite a bit). So somebody said something that was different from what you expected? That’s why you should always be prepared and not assume that the order is going to be the same.

Finally–possibly the most obvious–don’t be rude or spike the food. Case in point, an employee taking
