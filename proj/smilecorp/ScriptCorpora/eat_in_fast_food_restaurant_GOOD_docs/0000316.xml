 DINERS will know how many kilojoules they are about to consume when restaurant chains and fast food outlets are forced to display them on menus from February. 
 
NSW will become the nation&apos;s first state to force fast food chains to reveal their energy counts or face heavy fines and penalties under the new Fast Choices legislation.

The chains will have to display the average energy content of the foods they sell as well as the average adult daily energy intake of 8700kJ.

There are about 40 chains, with a total of about 2700 outlets, that are covered by the law. These include supermarkets and bakeries, as well as pizza, coffee and juice bar chains that serve ready-to-eat foods in standard portions with regular sizes and content.

While other cafes and restaurants were not required to display the information, the NSW Food Authority said they would be encouraged to do so.

McDonald&apos;s has already promised to reveal its energy information by November and other chains are set to follow soon after.

A medium Big Mac meal with a Coke has 4150kJ - close to half the average daily intake - but McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman Laura Keith said the company supported the new legislation.

&quot;We see this as the natural way of keeping our customers informed about what they are eating,&quot;she said. The fast food firm plans to roll the initiative out across the nation.

Small business minister Katrina Hodgkinson said Fast Choices gave consumers&quot;more knowledge and power&quot;over their diet.

&quot;I welcome any initiative that not only encourages people to think about the food they consume, but also ensures that food outlets provide accessible nutritional information to their customers,&quot;Ms Hodgkinson said.

Mandatory energy labelling has proved controversial in the US, where it was introduced to fight obesity. A New York University School of Medicine study released earlier this year found teenagers paid little attention to the labels.

Only 57 per cent of teens said they noticed the labelling and only 9 per cent said the information influenced their choices. Energy consumption did not change.

The NSW government is also preparing a response to the federal government&apos;s Blewett Review into kilojoule content and food labelling.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand will be meeting in December to discuss former health minister Neal Blewett&apos;s recommendations.
