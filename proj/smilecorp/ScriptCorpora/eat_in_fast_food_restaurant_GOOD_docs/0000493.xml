Gustavo Mendibles was working at Eegee&apos;s (a fast-food restaurant chain in Tucson), but it didn&apos;t give him enough hours. He started off baking at Cafe 54, then did prep work, dishwashing, worked as a line cook. Born and raised in Tucson, he&apos;s never left Arizona. He finds it peaceful and friendly here. 
Mendibles&apos; goal is to be a chef at Olive Garden.
