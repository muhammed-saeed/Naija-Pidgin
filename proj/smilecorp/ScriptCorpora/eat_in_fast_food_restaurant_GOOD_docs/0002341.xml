Usually, airport dining is a gut-wrenching abomination for me.  The service is snotty and rude and the food is cold and dry or otherwise barely palatable.  With a few exceptions.  I can usually stomach a McDonald&apos;s or Burger King if I have to, in the various airports.  Here I am in the airport in Atlanta Thursday, on my way to see my brother in Florida and I decide I&apos;d better have something in case it&apos;s too late for a regular dinner when I arrive in Orlando.  There just happened to be a Popeye&apos;s by my gate and it looked remarkably uncrowded so I stepped in.  I was immediately asked if I could be helped by a lady behind the counter, who was polite but brisk (they have to keep things moving, I know...) and then after I paid I quickly snatched an available table and a young woman approached me and asked me what I wanted to drink.  I told her and she told another employee that I already had a table.  They were seating people!  The chicken was hot and spicy and the red beans and rice were nice and warm!  I had a two piece meal and the service and the food were both awesome.  My hat is off to Popeye&apos;s in Atlanta&apos;s International Airport.  I&apos;m rating 5-stars because this place went above and beyond what is expected at an airport.  Keep up the good work folks!

The 1 place that I stop at no matter what. This is the BEST fast food restaurant in this airport and possibly the entire US. Their lines are efficient and even being 10th in line, I usually wait no more than 15 min. Once you get to the counter, your food meets you at the end as they constantly have food coming out of the kitchen.

Usually have a 2 or 3-piece dark with mashed potatoes. Some of the best Popeye&apos;s I have ever had. Grant it, Popeye&apos;s is not the greatest but if you hate Popeye&apos;s, give this one a try and your thoughts may change because I consider this a must have in ATL.

The huge seating area in this concourse makes for a relaxing environment and for eager plane watchers, you can sit by the window and watch planes taxi between the A&amp;B concourses.

Ate here on the way back from my honeymoon in Savannah GA. Prior to our trip, I just was so excited to be able to try some good old southern fried chicken during our stay in the south (I&apos;m from New England), but our trip was cut short by a death in my family and we had to return from our honeymoon after just 2 short days. I hadn&apos;t gotten to try any of the food I was anticipating.

Well on our short layover in Atlanta, my husband spied this Popeye&apos;s and suggested we try it. OMG what a good idea! I got the two piece chicken with a biscuit and side. I got a drumstick and wing, which were A-MAZING. So moist inside, and the coating on the chicken was crispy and delicious. It tasted so fresh! Seriously, we had $300 dollars meals in Savannah and this $5 fast food meal on our way home was the best food I had all week. It was that good. The biscuit was fine, and I didn&apos;t even have time to eat the fries that came with it, but the chicken was so good. It makes me sad that I live in New England where there is no such thing as Popeyes. KFC will never taste good to me again.

 4/6/2011 1 Check-in Here 
After taking a redeye from the LA area to Atlanta, which by the way arrived 30 mins early.  It&apos;s 6am, I have about a 2 hour layover because of our early arrival and techinically it&apos;s 3am at home.  I&apos;m tired but now hungry.  I had to walk from one concourse to another to get my connecting and since I had time, I was looking for a place to have some breakfast.  A lot of places were open.  It&apos;s airport food - so I&apos;m expecting extremely high prices and crappy food.  I can deal with a chain though - at least the expectations are met.

I decided on Popeyes because I wanted breakfast food, but most come with like sausage or bacon.  I don&apos;t partake in the swine.  But Popeyes had the option of getting chicken.  Sold.  Breakfast was 5 bucks (!) and change (including tax) for three chicken strips, eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit.  The biscuit was awesome.  warm and fluffy!

The girls here were SUPER nice, even considering how freakin early in the morning it was.

Okay okay yes I dont eat chicken or really anything served here- yet I always end up at this popeye&apos;s during a connection after my red eye flight from the west coast.  The employees here are awesome.  I generally order one or two plain biscuits and munch them on the way to the plane or hang out on the bar stools across from popeye&apos;s which there are a few outlets hiding to charge your electronics, phone, computer etc. great for people watching. they are sure to call you honey and give you a little southern somethin&apos;. there may be a line but it moves super quick.

For whatever reason the Popeyes franchises in the airport are much better than any outside or any other fast food chain inside.  The service is always lightening fast. The one on concourse C has a seating area which is kept clean and orderly. Someone is always on the floor asking about condiments and drink refills. The mosy unpleasant part is having to deal with the travelers who have are startled by the haste at which the team moves thru the line. Always a good experience.  Well done guys.

I hate layovers, but I love Popeyes. So when I spotted it at the food court at Gate B, I beelined over there. Ordered a four piece spicy chicken combo with Cajun fries and a drink for $9. Pricier than usual, but it&apos;s at the airport, so that&apos;s to be expected.

As always, the chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I prefer drumsticks, so I asked for 3 legs and 1 breast. Legs are the way to go!

Service was efficient, as there were about 5 women behind the counter.

Thanks for tiding me over during my 12 hours of travel time. Every airport should have a Popeyes!

Chaos.  Absolute chaos.

Although the ladies working behind the counter here call you &quot;baby&quot; and take orders and handle cashier efficiently, it seems like they&apos;re either completely understaffed for filling orders, or they&apos;re just inefficient (really... are tongs the best way to fill bags of hash brown tater tots?).

After paying, everyone just mills around waiting for their order, which they yell out -before- it&apos;s actually ready.  It&apos;s -as- they&apos;re filling the order that they shout out what it is... which seems a little unintuitive to me.  Don&apos;t most places shout out the order when it&apos;s actually ready to be picked up?  An order number system may be more effective here...

But for a deliciously fatty and filling spicy chicken biscuit after a night of drinking plenty of Maker&apos;s Mark... it was worth the wait.

I&apos;ve been very busy of late what with work, traveling, writing my Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants fan fiction, so I haven&apos;t been able to dedicate the proper amount of time to Yelp. Sure, I&apos;ve posted the occasional and typographically-challenged Talk post using my Blackberry, but my reviews are about as infrequent as Georgia victories against the Gators. But now that I&apos;m home for the week, I can regale all of you with my tales of glamor and celebrity, trips to such far flung locales as &quot;Hanover, Maryland&quot; and &quot;Allentown, Pennsylvania.&quot; I know, I know. My jetset lifestyle knows no bounds and yet amidst middle seat coach flights and dining at the finest continental breakfasts provided free by the hotel, I still have time for you, Dear Yelper. So let&apos;s get crackin&apos;.

I&apos;m so glad to see positive non-Atlantan reviews of our dear friend, the Hartsfield-Jackson Popeye&apos;s, for that shows that sheer, unadulterated AWESOMENESS is recognized the world over.  Take heed, however, you non-Atlantans. Should you ever spend more than a layover in our fair city, you would notice that the upbeat efficiency that characterizes this location is limited ONLY to the airport. Visit another Popeye&apos;s location in town and you will be met with the angry scowls of the damned.

Some may use this as an opportunity to complain about the other Popeye&apos;s, but predictability isn&apos;t one of my strong suits.  In fact, I find that this location&apos;s politeness and ability to get my order right the first time somewhat disconcerting. It&apos;s like ordering from the Soup Nazi and being asked not only if you &quot;want to sample some of our soups before ordering&quot; but also being informed upon leaving to &quot;have a nice day.&quot;  Brrrrrrrr!  It&apos;s unnatural. I prefer my Popeye&apos;s poorly managed with customer service that knows nothing of servicing customers. I&apos;ve grown accustomed to this black cloud in the silver lining of my spicy 3 piece as I have with the knowledge that driving in Atlanta traffic is the cost for me to live in our shining city. As my dearly departed granny used to say, if life gives you lemons, make a lemon party.

Despite my reservations, the chicken is still the thing and Hartsfield-Jackson Popeye&apos;s still delivers. Five stars.

Raise your hand if you like fried chicken in the morning!

After a red-eye from Los Angeles, I ended up in Atlanta for a layover. Peanuts do not equal sustenance, and the bright red-and-yellow Popeye&apos;s looked mighty tempting. Besides, since Popeye&apos;s started in the South, it was only appropriate that I stop in.

While Popeye&apos;s touts &quot;[food] served with a smile&quot;, I noticed a few cashiers who didn&apos;t even smirk as they called people to to pay. Truly, the faster customers pay and get their chicken, the faster the line, and the happier everyone is!

A two-piece fried chicken meal ($5.10, plus biscuit) made it into my hands. I ripped into a biscuit, a semi-buttery affair, before focusing on the wing and drumstick. They were smaller than I expected, so go for a three-piece meal if you&apos;re famished. I had my chicken prepared spicy, not mild, which only tasted mildly spicy - still, a good flavor nonetheless. Thankfully my chicken was moist enough, so the coleslaw side I had wasn&apos;t strictly necessary.

I neglected to get a drink, and decided to go without. A staffer busy cleaning noticed my drinklessness and offered to get me water, and I said sure - the unexpected hospitality was appreciated! On my way out, she told me to come back and visit again soon - I certainly will. Popeye&apos;s might be a harebrained breakfast idea to some, but I found greasy chicken to be a tasty morning snack.

The ATL airport Popeye&apos;s saved my life!  I was connecting on Delta from Freeport, Bahamas to San Francisco on New Year&apos;s Day so hungover that disorientation, paranoia, tunnel vision, and ear ringing were in full effect.  I got off the plane, and the big Popeye&apos;s sign beckoned me like a port in a storm.  Unfortunately, there was also a line of about 15 people in front, but at that point, I was committed.

Incredibly, the service at this Popeye&apos;s is BLAZINGLY fast.  After waiting only 30 seconds in line, all of the chicken is right there behind the glass, and a line of 5-6 workers is standing right behind the chicken with genuine smiles on their faces.  Every single one of them said &quot;Good morning and welcome to Popeye&apos;s, may I take your order?&quot; like they meant it!

Literally no more than 5 seconds later, I had my meal in my hand, and 5 seconds later I was cashing out.  To speed things along even further, you walk to a separate drink station where the worker&apos;s sole job is to get you your drink ASAP.  5 seconds after that, I was seated with my meal!

NYE drinks in the Bahamas:  $300
Flight back:  $600
Combo #3 at Popeye&apos;s:  $8
Starting to eat your Combo #3 so that its miracle grease can start to neutralize the alcohol in your system that makes you want to die 45 seconds after you got in line on New Year&apos;s Day even though there were 15 people ahead of you:  PRICELESS

I&apos;m a huge Popeye&apos;s fan.  Before I knew there were Popeye&apos;s in Miami, I used to relish the days when I had layovers in the Atlanta airport, solely for the fact that I could chow down on delicious Popeye&apos;s chicken and biscuits while waiting for my connecting flights.

Even though I can get Popeye&apos;s in my city, those menus don&apos;t compare to the one at the Atlanta airport.  I had an early flight recently, and happened to stumble across Popeye&apos;s during breakfast hours, so of course, I had to check out their selection.

The chicken biscuit quite possibly made my day.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the biscuit was buttery and fabulous.  All in all, a great breakfast sandwich!  My wardrobe is thankful that I can only indulge in Popeye&apos;s breakfast on occasion!

I had never had the pleasure of eating Popeye&apos;s Chicken ever before until I decided to chance it one day and try it here at the airport of all places.  The obsession started with my very first bite of their extremely buttery yet salty biscuits and a combo bite (meaning you still have some food left in your mouth from the previous bite) of a fried chicken drum stick.  It immediately set the bar as my favorite fried chicken fast food chain (over Chick-Fil-A or KFC any day) and I have loved it ever since.

Pathetically and nostalgically, I go out of my way to go to this terminal if I have time whenever I&apos;m at the airport.  Sure its just Popeye&apos;s Chicken, but of all of the airports I visit frequently, this is the only one that has it. Service has been particularly kind to me and the prices aren&apos;t of the airport variety.  A two piece meal with a medium drink, a side, and a biscuit is $5.95 last time I checked.  Thats not bad for greasy eats in one of the best airports in the US.

It was March 2005 and my last day in Hotlanta.  I was anxiously waiting to get back to SF after a cross-country trip and found myself with some time to kill at the airport.

Hmm...what should I have for breakfast... pizza? eh.  tacos? meh. muffin? borrring. Wait, is that a Popeye&apos;s in the food court?  I never had it before even though I&apos;ve seen them plenty in the west side.  The big line drew my attention though and once the thought of fried chicken gets in your head, you can&apos;t get it out.

It was $2 for chicken and a biscuit, so I bought 2.  They don&apos;t even have that on the menu at the three San Fran Popeye&apos;s I&apos;ve been to since, let alone a price like that. Damn tastiest fast food I had the whole trip (including all the Waffle Houses).

The big southern lady working the line was super on top of things and the friendliest person I&apos;ve met at a fast food counter.  One of those people that loves her job (rare to see in an airport).
She was like &quot;Ohhh honey chil&apos; honey chil&apos;, what can I get you?&quot;
&quot;Uh, chicken and a biscuit&quot;
&quot;Chicken and a biscuit! Good Lord, Good Lord you sweet thing! Comin right up!&quot;

Then some pilot was in line behind me and she was like &quot;awww sugar, so good to see you again!  How are things? The usual?&quot;

Unreal.  Totally unreal.  Next time I book a flight anywhere, I&apos;ll see if it connects through Atlanta&apos;s airport to see if this gem still exists. Damn, that was some good eatin&apos;.  No Popeye&apos;s has compared since.

Honestly, this is the best Popeyes I have ever been to.  Anytime I have folks coming in town, or I/or them are leaving out.  I insist that they/or me make  a stop at this Popeyes.

Simply amazing.  Because of the high traffic/high volume of business that they do, the food is always fresh.  I love the fact that they also sell catfish here if you dont do chicken or just have a taste for seafood.

The service is &quot;southern&quot; but you can certainly tell that there focus is getting your order and getting you the hell out of their line!

The sweet tea is addictive and tastes like straight candy.

I dont care if it is 7am or high noon, make SURE that you get your ass to this Popeyes if you set foot in Atlanta airport!

This Concourse B Popeye&apos;s is a busy little place.  It features (of course!) all the usual Popeye&apos;s specialties - my favorite being spicy chicken and red bean 7 rice.

Most Popeye&apos;s have unbelievable chaos behind the counter, but this one, of necessity I guess, has markedly less. I have eaten there twice recently and the second time there were, indeed,  7 people in red t-shirts bumping into each other behind the counter more interested in talking to each other than the waiting customers, but that&apos;s the general Popeye&apos;s culture/atmosphere - so sit back and enjoy it.

The food is well worth the wait...

I live in Atlanta and travel most weeks -- I make it a point to stop by the Popeye&apos;s in Concourse B -- even if my flight is in another concourse. Why?

The chicken is really good and the people are super friendly. The manager call&apos;s everyone &apos;Baby&apos; - &apos;What can I get you baby&apos;? It may be 6:30am and I might not be awake yet but they always brighten my day.

I was so angry when i ate here. I missed my flight by like 5 minutes because of my previous flight being super slow. So I spent 10 hours wandering the airport and I got hungry. So I stopped at the food court and this was the best choice. I got like a two piece meal that came out to like 7 bucks bit pricey cause I&apos;ve never actually paid for Popeye&apos;s ha ha. It was good better then the cheap piece of crap on the border that I had later on for dinner.

Mmmm mmm mmh...finger lickin&apos; good! Even though I&apos;ve had popeyes in the westcoast, I just saw it fitting that we try it in Georgia. Afterall, this is where the headquarters are. And for that fact, it tasted 10x better!! I normally don&apos;t eat the skin but I just had to on this visit. I got down to business &quot;hands and all&quot; while dipping in the mash with Cajun gravy and the awesome Louisiana hot sauce. Total comfort food and kept my tummy full for the 5hr flight back home.

On the red eye flight with a couple of hours layover at the ATL airport, we were stalking the aisles looking for food at 4:30 AM!  Popeye&apos;s was the only one with breakfast.  We had the sausage biscuit sandwich with tater tots. And also tried their chicken bisquit sandwich (like their fried chicken).  The biscuits here are very good, better than at the Popeye&apos;s in SF on Divisadero.  Very buttery tasting.  The inner contents were OK, not great.  So, if you&apos;re stuck in ATL in the wee hours of the AM, consider stopping by at Popeye&apos;s if you&apos;re hungry.

With the prospect of a 20 hour layover I really needed something to improve my spirits. Thankfully Popeyes delivered. It&apos;s your normal Popeyes but as others have said because the turn over is so great the chicken is fresh and juicy. It&apos;s also spicy which is how I like it. Seriously if you are coming from out of state try it, it&apos;ll make that layover slightly more bearable.

It&apos;s faster than some of the other places and good enough if you don&apos;t want breakfast in the morning.

Fried chicken and biscuits for breakfast? Yep. There&apos;s no way you can pass that up when you have an early morning layover in Atlanta! One of the best airport meals I&apos;ve ever had, and I was definitely called &quot;sugar&quot; and &quot;honey&quot; multiple times while ordering. Look for it in Concourse B, and you won&apos;t be disappointed with this Southern gem.
