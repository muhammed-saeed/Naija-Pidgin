It has a VERY large selection, and ALL the food was delicious! I even tried and liked the squid! And I&apos;m known for not being for of seafood lol
The sushi bar is really big too, had a huge selection, and it was great for the lunch price. I don&apos;t think i&apos;d go for dinner though at like $15.99 because i wouldn&apos;t eat any of the expensive rib or shrimp or anything. I&apos;m happy with the orange chicken, beef and broccoli and sushi and stuff xD

Would recommend it to anyone and will be going there again!

Will definitely be going back!

We were jonesing for Chinese buffet food, so we drove over to Sakura. We looked in the windows at the very unimpressive and dingy dining room, packed asshole to elbow. We&apos;d stepped about three inches from the entrance, seeing the disgusting carpet and overall shabby appearance, when we did a quick turn around and dashed back to the car. No way in hell did we want to step foot in that hole, no matter how inciting the food smelled. So, we remembered that Asia Buffet was near the Target by the mall, so we headed over.

What a relief! Respectful patrons, a lovely welcoming foyer, a koi fish pond, and a host who immediately took us to a table. We&apos;d already been won over. The waiter took our drink orders and we hit the lines. We liked what we saw...lots of fruits, cold shrimp, Chinese staples (fried rice, orange chicken, broccoli beef), as well as some more intriguing dishes (salt&amp;pepper squid). The sushi selection was good, too. Since we were there for weekday lunch, I don&apos;t think they had the prime rib available.

After two trips to the food lines and one plate of dessert, we were ridiculously full. I couldn&apos;t get enough walnut shrimp and the hubs couldn&apos;t get enough honey chicken. The orange chicken was a little soft for our liking, but we&apos;re those white folk who love Panda Express orange chicken. ;) The desserts are nothing spectacular, just your run of the mill buffet assortment of cookies, cheesecake, mystery pastries, and a self-serve soft-serve machine.

We were definitely cool with our bill. $9.99/each for food, $1.89 for each of our sodas, so our grand total was right around $25. While we kind of wish we&apos;d worn stretchy pants or at least had properly mentally prepared ourselves for the onslaught of food we were about to experience, we will surely be going back to Asia Buffet in the near future. That is, if we can ignore the call of the chicken tikka masala across the parking lot at Malhi&apos;s.

Asian food - love it.  Especially Thai.  I think I must have been Asian in a prior life.  But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself.

Recently, my wife (who shall remain nameless) and I had occasion to visit Palmdale Regional Medical Center.  Not to worry, just a heart attack, nothing serious.  It was a long, long time ago and I take much better care of myself now, sort of.  And I reduced the stress in my life, somewhat, got rid of my ex (who shall remain nameless also).  But I&apos;m getting away from the subject.

Anyway, after completing our business at PRMC we decided we needed to eat before beginning the long trek home.  After being told that we&apos;d find a large selection of places to eat in the mall on 10th St West, we headed in that direction.  And in our search I saw the words &quot;Asia Buffet&quot; and the place started calling to me.  We had no choice but to go in.

My first reaction upon entering the establishment was - BIG.  Directly in front of us was a small fountain and pond.  Small yet large enough to hold a bunch of fish.  Koi . . . big goldfish . . . I don&apos;t know.  Don&apos;t know anything about fish except when it comes to eating.  To the immediate left was a pretty good sized dining room.  Nice sized booths, comfortable.  To the immediate right was a pretty good sized dining area.  Less plush, but still nice.  And beyond that was another large room similar to the room to the left.

And beyond the fountain and pond lay an expanse of food.  All kinds of food.  Many, many selections.  A sushi bar, salads, chicken dishes, beef dishes, shrimp dishes, deserts . . . lots and lots of selections.  Unfortunately, I found the food not quite as good as the large number of selections to choose from.  Or perhaps I just chose the wrong ones.

The best thing I had was the Spinach Stir Fry, excellent, I highly recommend it.  Also very good were the Honey Chicken and the Hot Pepper Chicken.  The Chicken-On-A-Stick was good as was the Orange Chicken.  I would recommend trying these dishes.

There was a cold unidentified chicken salad that was so-so and the Vegetable Lo Mein was nothing to write home about.  But they weren&apos;t what I&apos;d call bad.  I just didn&apos;t go back for second servings of them.

I really like Black Pepper Beef so I was disappointed with what I got.  It was flavorful, but the meat was very chewy.  Had the Broccoli Beef and while it was also flavorful, it was also very chewy.  Maybe it was just a bad day for beef.  There was a Cilantro Shrimp that had a great sauce, but the shrimp was tasteless.  Didn&apos;t really care for the Garlic Green Beans, although my wife really liked them.  I felt they were a little too al dente for my taste.

They also had a Shrimp Ceviche that was pretty good.  I know that&apos;s not Asian, but then neither was the Prime Rib they had.  I didn&apos;t try any of that after chewing on the other beef I had.

I should mention that the staff were friendly, courteous, and attentive without being overly so. They would periodically walk by, observing the table to see if we needed anything, showing themselves in case we wanted to gain their attention, and not once interrupting our conversation or asking me a question as soon as I put a forkful of food in my mouth.

Really torn between three and four stars for this one.  Wish I could select three and a half.  So I guess since this is a first visit I&apos;ll have to give them the benefit of the doubt.

It&apos;s a typical Chinese buffet. The quality, ambience and cleanliness are slightly better than the two other places in town, but the check will run you about $7.00 more at this place, and it wasn&apos;t $7.00 better. For a $20 dinner, you might as well go to a quality place and order off the menu.

Came here with sister for dinner. If you are in AV and you&apos;re looking for a decent all you can eat buffet place for asian food, I would say this is it. If this place was located in Los Angeles, I would have given it 3 stars, but it&apos;s hard to find decent (americanized) Asian food in AV so I&apos;m giving it 4 stars. The place is clean and big and the staff is courteous.

There are choices of Chinese, Korean, Japanese food. Seafood including crab legs, oysters, shrimps, crawfish, etc are there. A soup station, salad bar and dessert section is there too; it includes soft serve, pudding, fruits, pastries, etc. For two people with two drinks, the total came out to be about $36 but I had a $5 off coupon so I paid $31 plus tip.

Overall, I think the food is decent. Don&apos;t be afraid to try a little bit of everything. It seemed like many just stuck to 1 or 2 stereotypical asian food choices but I think you will be pleasantly surprised from trying something new at the buffet. The point is it&apos;s all you can eat with many choices to choose from.

TIP: For those who are sensitive to msg/fried foods/processed foods
-IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC or sensitive to msg or have eczema, I do not recommend coming here to eat as you will barely have any choices. My sister&apos;s eczema flares and gets incredibly itchy from eating msg containing foods. So we asked one of the workers bringing out the food whether they use MSG or not. Neither the worker nor anyone else working there was able to answer us. We are assuming Asia Buffet food contains msg because when we got home, she was so itchy that she had to take benedryl to finally fall asleep.

We came here while short on time, so we decided to get something quick.

When we walked in, it was nicely decorated with an asian theme and pretty open setting.

There was a pretty big variety including salads, sushi, cooked food,&amp;dessert bar.  However, not everything looked appetizing.

Good:
Fried noodles - pretty tasty&amp;good texture
Garlic string beans - good flavor&amp;fresh

Bad:
Sushi - the rice was hard....
Fruits were from the can or not fresh

Service was at par of asian restaurants, look for them when you need something.

All in all, you get what you pay for.  Lunch was $21 for 2 people.

I&apos;m reading some of these negative reviews, and I can only think of, Hometown Buffet nuthuggers.

Seriously.

Been here 6 times, and every time I&apos;ve been amazed with the quality of their food. They don&apos;t cheap out on their food, it&apos;s all fresh, and everything is delicious.

About the Oysters, you are aware this can happen right? You can get super sick from eating RAW oysters. My parents have not gotten sick, and that&apos;s all they really chow down on when we go. Not saying that person is lying, but c&apos;mon, that can happen anywhere.

I saw a review that compared this to Hometown. Hometown is garbage. Trust me. I get discounts there, and I refuse to go, cause its crap.

This is the KING of buffets in the AV. I mean, that&apos;s not saying much, since King Buffet, Buffet King, and Hometown Buffet all suck. It&apos;s just about goddamn time a good one landed and remind me that yes, good buffets still exist, and they&apos;re not only in Vegas.

EDIT:

i forgot to mention the service. The service is great here. The manager comes to your table and asks you if everything was good. The waiters are always there to take your plates and fill up your drinks. Great service.

I have tried many Asian buffets. Some are worth the couple of dollars while others are not as worthy. I have to say that this one is by far my favorite buffet.

While the shrimp, meats, and desserts are amazing, the service wasn&apos;t that great. The dirty plates kept piling up and our waitress didn&apos;t clean when we need it. Also, the waitress didnt ask us for beverage refills at all.

Other than that, it is an amazing restaurant with great food!!

Quality buffet! Probably the only quality buffet place in the Antelope Valley...

My sister chose Asia Buffet to celebrate her graduation. We waited 10 minutes which was really great for a Friday night and all the other graduation celebrations going around.

A couple of my favorites:

1. The sushi! It&apos;s good and they have nigiri of pretty good quality. They also had a sushi chef making fresh rolls.

2. The cream cheese wontons, walnut shrimp and the duck are so succulent and delicious. I also like that the chow mein isn&apos;t too greasy..just greasy enough.

3. I also love the hot n sour soup.

After being out of town for a year, my parents took me to this place for dinner the first evening I was back. This location has seen several different Asian buffets over the years, and apparently this version of the buffet opened late 2010.

WOW.... just WOW.... The variety of food was spectacular and absolutely delicious. Not to mention that it&apos;s a buffet so that you can eat as much of it as you like. This place could be troublesome for people that lack self control, it&apos;s just that good.

There is a huge fresh seafood section including raw oysters, steamed shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, and mussels. The sushi bar was revamped and even includes my favorite: SASHIMI! The variety of sushi was impressive, incredibly fresh and high quality. Such a place is difficult to find in a desert town such as Palmdale.

This place also has the usual Asian buffet staples such as a fruit and pudding dessert section, soft serve ice cream machine, assorted pastries and cakes and traditional Chinese dishes. New offerings included prime rib and halibut! Very classy!

I was incredibly impressed with the level of quality and amount of variety that this buffet has. It&apos;s definitely the classiest buffet in Palmdale, and a bargain at about $15/adult.

My 1st experience with this restaurant was when I went on Labor Day. I was going in for lunch and was surprised that they had a &quot;special&quot; which was all day dinner for $15.99. Normally the lunch is $9.99 so I was a bit surprised at the pricing and decided not to eat here. A few other people walked out as well. I saw it as just another way to make money.

I went back to eat today and the food was ok. I staff wasn&apos;t friendly and they never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks but they were good at picking up our plates fast. The décor was nice, simple and modern.

The food was so-so. They like to go crazy with the cheese on some of the items. The sushi wasn&apos;t great and the dessert was disappointing. I did like the fried rice, low mein and chicken dishes.

I probably will not be returning, but hey, you never know.....

I am sooo stuffed!! Pretty good selection, especially seafood and sushi. Food was pretty good, especially the stuffed shrimp and orange chicken. Decent price too, about $12 for lunch and a soda. My first time there, I&apos;ll definitely go back.

Couple of things... I wish they had Mongolian BBQ like Sakura. Also, I wish they had a more descriptive restaurant name... I had no idea what they were going to serve there! :) Other than that, pretty good overall.

What a difference from the last time I went here!
Well, I&apos;ll say the last time was at least a couple of years, and it was a different owner. The decor now is more modern, but they still have the cool little pond in the lobby. And the food was awesome! I&apos;m amazed at what they had, especially for a buffet.
Like other reviewers said, its a fusion of different Asian cuisines. On one plate I had little spare ribs, kim chi, a sushi roll, shell on shrimp, green beans, etc. Also I tried the raw oysters- and they were good! I&apos;ll have you know that I had no ill effects after.
Try this place out!

My family and I have been here numerous time already and everytime we are here the food and the service is great. The price is not bad either. I like their sushi selection, which coming from me is good because I&apos;m picky with sushi.

The overall decor of the place is very clean and hope it stays that way. The prices for the buffet is not bad either for $15/dinner you get prime rib which according to husband is really good.

Ok..first I&apos;ve been there 3 times now and will go back. It is more expensive than Sakura Buffet down the road but you get what you pay for.
Great Chinese/Asian/Sushi buffet!
They have a HUGE selection of sushi...I am not very knowledgeable about sushi but everything I have tried there was great!
The hot food is always HOT and fresh! Doesn&apos;t look or taste like it has been sitting under the heat lamps all day.
The wait staff keeps your table clean and you drink full. I even had a beer last time we were there and the price wasn&apos;t too bad for a buffet. $4 for a Saporo.
My only disappointment is the crab legs are on the cold bar with the peel and eat shrimp. I like hot crab legs.....however they are pretty tasty!
Will be back again and again!

This place has lots of selection for an Asian buffet place. I didn&apos;t do the AYCE. I had their $3.99/lb. I was quite a bit of food for about $7.89. Tempura. Fried rice. The food was pretty ordinary. Nothing special, not bad, but not a super buffet!

The service and the staff were very friendly and were very attentive to your needs but I was not impressed with the food and the selection. It also cost $15.99 per person and that is a little too pricey for how the food taste. I am new to the Antelope Valley area and I&apos;m used to exp better buffets in LA but this is probably the best asian buffet here I guess..regardless I won&apos;t go back there, it&apos;s not worth the $

I&apos;m not a big fan of buffets. I don&apos;t feel that buffets can pull it off especially out here in the A.V. The ones out here just suck. This location had several owners and went out of business several times.
Asia buffet is more of an Asian fusion AYCE (all you can eat) of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and American cuisines. I was surprised at the food choices, quality, and the service. They have a good selection of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Which was a ok on my book. I&apos;m a sushi snob sorry. Good soup choices. One of the best hot and sour soups I&apos;ve had in a long time. I enjoyed the grilled sea bass ( had seconds and thirds). They have good choices of cooked and fresh seafood, good salads, good fruits, good desserts, good Korean ribs, and the prime rib was not too bad. Overall I would rate it higher than Todai and the best out here in the AV and Santa Clarita area. Pricing is great for the amount of seafood choices. $16 for dinner and $10 for lunch. Drinks are extra. Go give it a shot...

I visited this buffet on mis-information. Someone told me it was a mongolian bbq type of place. I was disappointed since it is not but then I figured we are here, might as well eat. Well the chinese food was so-so, really typical buffet food. The sushi was good. But the price was outrageous I thought for a buffet. $15.99 per person + drinks are separate. Really the price is worth it only if you eat a lot of sushi and eat the crab legs. But if you are only there for the chinese food its really overpriced. No wonder the place was practically empty.

Considering the choices here in the AV, this is going to be the buffet I go back to for LUNCH.  It was $9.99 per person, $2 for a drink which they deliver and refill for you.  Not a bad price at all, but dinner is $15.99 and I did ask what the difference was.  At dinner they add crab legs, oysters, prime rib and a few other things.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere for dinner, at  $16 plus tax and the drink...  If you are going to eat the prime rib and crab legs, it would be a steal; but since I would probably stick with the items I had on the lunch menu it just wouldn&apos;t be worth the extra bucks.

First off, I love good quality sushi which is fresh and cut for me when I order it, as sushi should be, so I did NOT try the nigiri or maki sushi. I am not a fan of all you can eat low quality fish or maki in general.  If you are going to go for an all you can eat sushi place, it is just like the others and there was the normal selection of precut nigiri (maguro, tai, anago etc) and a large selection of maki so for the price (lunch or dinner) you can&apos;t beat it especially with all the other offerings.

So, with that said, I did like the large assortment of seafood, soup, entrees and salads.  I was very glad to see a spinach salad, Caesar salad, kimchi and healthy dark green lettuces.  I don&apos;t eat an iceburg salad, it is 90% water and a waste of my time nutritionally so this was a big plus for me. They had a large array of fruit as well, watermelon, pineapple, kiwi, papaya, cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries - all fresh.  They had about 6 different soups too so this alone beats out that all you can eat soup/salad place in town.  You CAN eat a very healthy lunch here for $9.99!

I was really impressed with the BBQ pork, usually it is chewy but theirs is actually tender and tasty.   Not so much the chicken on the stick, but hey they can&apos;t make everybody happy with every dish.  On the whole, there was nothing I truly hated, and more things I liked.  They had mussels both in the shell by the raw bar and with cheese over on the entree side.  My brother loves mussels and said they were really good.  They also had clams, peel and eat shrimp, and crawfish.

They had a lot of seafood dishes:  2 kinds of cooked fish, shrimp a few different ways and the aforementioned precut sushi and raw bar.

They had enough soup, salad, and non-seafood entrees to keep someone who doesn&apos;t enjoy seafood content.

I am a fan, and will be back.

I don&apos;t like buffets but this one is a good one... very nice, authentic Asian&amp;seafood choices.... the price isn&apos;t cheap but that is a good thing in Palmdale in terms of filtering the crowd....

Took a chance on this buffet place, Asian-themed buffets are a crapshoot: some are good, many are bad, and several are just downright ugly. This one falls into the good category.
If seafood is your thing then you&apos;ll love this place. They have a very good sushi section. I would normally never eat sushi at a buffet place, but this is worth the exeption.They have a wonderful assortment of rolls, some nigri (including tuna) and even sashimi. As for he cooked seafood you can&apos;t go wrong there either. They had snow crab legs, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, even crawfish as well as octopus and squid. All of it is fresh and good quality, and the roatation is constant because the place is busy.
Other standouts include the roast duck, expertly cooked with a wonderful crispy skin. The Chinese spare ribs are also good, as are the chicken skewers, The beef w/ broccoli is also another winner. The orange chicken wasn&apos;t anything to write home about but given all the other tasty bits to eat there you can skip it. They also have a rib roast. Personally I think they overcook it (I like my meat rare) but it&apos;s well seasoned and if you like your meat more done then I do then you&apos;ll like the roast. There&apos;s a nice desert spread there including cream puffs and soft-serve ice cream. But I could barely eat any desert given what I had already consumed.
The service was friendly and attentive. Our server checked in with us many times to remove used plates and refill drinks.
Overall given the quality of the food they offer the price is nice. I will definitely go back.

Alright if you are looking for AYCE sushi you can go here but don&apos;t compare it to others it&apos;s not the best.  Super clean, cool Koi pond, endless oysters!  Can&apos;t go wrong there.  My bud and I had three beers and the buffet for $45.  I&apos;ll return for sure.

Best Asia Buffet in the AV area, at $15 a person plus $2 for drink for dinner it&apos;s not the cheapest but well worth the money.
The prices for dinner may be a little steeper than other buffets, but definitely worth it.
If you not a big fan of seafood you might want to try another Asia Buffet that is cheaper.
The sushi is very good and fresh for a buffet, they have lots of different rolls, Nigiri-sushi, and Sashimi.
King crab legs are very good but you might have to keep an eye open for when they refill them, they go fast but they restock them pretty fast. Oysters where fresh. The Roast Beef was excellent and juicy and very tender.
Overall the food is very good, much better than anything you would get at the hometown buffet, the food just tastes of a higher quality.
Dessert offerings are superb as well, including real New York cheese cake.
Service is always great.

Well, Went here for dinner.  excellent choices. Food prepared fresh and more of a selection than the lunch buffet. Definitly a nice place for the A.V and will go here again. My only complaint is that the condiments for the sushi bar are on the other side of the place. If they would bunch all like items together it would be nice.

Good place. There are a lot of choices. Spicy and sour soup is great. Fried stuffs are too oily and mushy. They have sashimi for dinner but quality is not great.

I don&apos;t know why this place is getting great reviews. When I walked into this place, I thought the buffet looked great; however, after my girlfriend and I began trying it all, we realized that the cold food (sushi, crab legs, prawns, etc [not salad or fruit]) was completely uneatable. The sushi rolls tasted like they had been sitting out for hours, and the crab meat inside the crab legs was pure white mush.  Most of the hot food (deep fried crab, orange chicken, etc) was pretty good, but what ended my night on a sour note was the tempura vegetables. I took one bite, and realized I was biting into ice-cold slop. The broccoli was cold, and not only that, had basically liquefied inside the tempura coating. When I informed the manager, her only response was &quot;sorry, the cooks forgot to throw it away, it&apos;s been out since lunch.&quot; This was 6:30pm. They opened at 11AM or earlier.  Fine management skills at their best!

I was very displeased with the quality either it was too cold or just warm. The prime rib was cold even though it was under a warming light and the crab legs were cold. Kids 10 and up pay the same price as adults which was $ 15.00 and no drinks included. When it was all said and done it came out  to be 100.00 for our whole family of 5 We could of gone to Hometown Buffet and probably gotten about the same quality. I don&apos;t recommend them and if two other Asian Buffet restaurants didn&apos;t make it at that location, I suspect this one won&apos;t either.
