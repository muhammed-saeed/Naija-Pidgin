 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 01 2005 California Governor Vetoes Marriage Equality Bill 

 On September 29th Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed Equality California-sponsored Assembly Bill 849, the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, which had passed the state Senate and Assembly. He said that he did not feel that the legislature can overturn an initiative that the voters had decided. As a result of his veto, hundreds of thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Californians and their families will continue to live without equal protection of the law. Equality California chapters and allied organizations hosted community gatherings in response to the Governor&apos;s veto on Friday, in Bakersfield, Los Angeles, Modesto, Sacramento, San Francisco ( Photos: 1 ), San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, Solano County, and Ukiah, and on Thursday in San Diego.

The Governor did sign four remaining EQCA-sponsored bills: Assembly Bill (AB) 1400, the Civil Rights Act of 2005 (Laird, D-Santa Cruz), Senate Bill (SB) 973, which allows domestic partners of public employees who retired prior to January 1, 2005, to receive death benefits if the retiree dies before their partner; SB 565, which ensures legally recognized domestic partners are treated the same as spouses under California&apos;s property tax laws; and AB 1586, the Insurance Gender Non-Discrimination Act.

 Binghamton Oct 01 2005 Fox-40 Apparently Self-Censors Time Warner Contract Story 

 Put aside your prejudices about &quot;Fox News&quot;, because our local Fox affiliate has given absolutely the best coverage of progessive events, radical actions, and the SP4 trial and tribunal. And for this, we all should be grateful.
Fox-40 was the ONLY local news outlet to cover Sept 21&apos;s Binghamton City Council&apos;s work session where the new cable contract was reviewed.

So why has the story apparently been removed from the website?

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 01 2005 PL Cited for Violation on Old-Growth Logging Plan 

 Pacific Lumber jumped the gun on logging operations in a controversial logging plan that contains a large stand of ancient redwoods which serve as habitat for an endangered seabird, the Marbled Murrelet. PL received a “Notice of Violation” Thursday from the Regional Water Board citing timber operations inside the so-called “Bonanza” timber plan that took place without a required waiver for waste discharge (sediment) into Nanning Creek. According to the Environmental Protection Information Center, the Bonanza harvest plan contains the largest unprotected, contiguous, occupied marbled murrelet stand left on Maxxam/PL&apos;s land.

 San Diego Oct 02 2005 Reports from Rebel Territory 

 Today I start heading home. I&apos;m writing these words for a few reasons. One is to share a bit of the reality of the revolution going on here in Chiapas with you. Another is so that I can remember it all well. Another is to encourage you to come to Chiapas if you think it is for you. 

These are some of the words of a San Diego Indymedia journalist who has recently been in Chiapas, Mexico. Traveling, working, and learning about Zapatismo and indigenous autonomy in southern Mexico, you can read his reports and see his photos below.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 02 2005 Audio, Photos and Written Reports from Houston and New Orleans

 Portland Oct 02 2005 AUDIO FILE: Reclaiming Our Election Process 

 In July of 2005, at the First Unitarian Church in Portland Oregon a forum was held concerning the legality of our recent elections, and the viability of the United States election process itself. Here in this report, you will be able to access audio files of these important and urgent presentations, either in RealMedia format or in MP3 format.
This forum featured two speakers, Thom Hartman, author and well known radio talk show host; and Paul Lehto, attorney, who recently wrote a paper on election fraud, and who is involved in a lawsuit in King County Superior Court, against Snohomish County and Sequoia Voting Systems.

This week end, September 30-October 2, 2005, a three day event is being held entitled, &quot;National Summit To Save Our Elections.&quot; Our community will have the opportunity to learn how corporate-owned electronic election systems affect their vote, and how they can help restore citizen ownership of our elections. Both Thom Hartmann, and Paul Lehto will be making presentations, as well as other well known, and unfortunately for our right to vote, less known speakers will be in attendance.

 Portland Oct 02 2005 Take ACTION: SEIU Protest today at PDX Art Museum

Portland Art Museum
1219 SW Park Avenue (corner of SW Park and SW Main)

The Portland Art Museum has just named its new building after Melvin &quot;Pete&quot; Mark, multi-million dollar building owner. On Sunday, October 2, Mark will be celebrated as a generous philanthropist at the museum&apos;s ribbon-cutting.

Ken Saro-Wiwa, an author and activist, was hanged in Nigeria together with eight other Ogoni men, on November 10, 1995 ten years ago. His only crime was protesting non-violently against an oil company, and demanding his rights. In the last ten years, much has changed in Ogoni, Nigeria, and the world, but more has not. Oil producing communities still fight for their environmental and human rights from Ogoni to Burma, Ecuador, Iraq and Louisiana.

 LA Oct 02 2005 Farmers Camping out to Defend the Farm 

 
Since 1992, the 14 acres of property located at 41st and Alameda Streets in Los Angeles have been used as a community garden or farm. The land has been divided into 360 plots and is believed to be one of the largest urban gardens in the country.

The farmers are in danger of losing their farm to developers who want to raze it and build a warehouse. Most of the farmers rely on the food they grow on the farm for their livelihood and the loss of their plots would cause them irreparable harm.

Farmers also have reason to fear a late night attack on the farm by the developer’s demolition crew. They are currently camping out at the farm in a round the clock vigil to defend the farm and alert supporters from around the city to come to the farm and block the bulldozers if it comes to that.

 Portland Oct 03 2005 HOPE 

 One day on the bridge a woman asked me why I call myself the Lone Vet. She also was interested in what I saw for the future of our beloved country. I remember answering that I did not know but there is always hope. For the second time a friend asked me about this most important concept, so I will try to answer the question, &quot;Is there hope?&quot;
Our republic, in my opinion, is based on trust. We elect people to represent us in Washington and we trust them to do honorable work for the betterment of the country. Most of us want to be free from the nuts and bolts of running this country that we call the United States of America, we are busy trying to live our lives. We are in the grips of a criminal administration and are now forced to look at the decisions that were made and the reason for those decisions. We trusted our politicians and the trust was broken almost from the first day Bush took office. I do have hope, and it is you. [ read more ]

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 03 2005 UCSF To Pay Huge Fines Rather Than Face Public Hearings 

 University of California San Francisco this past week paid one of the largest fines for Animal Welfare Act violations in history. Last fall the U.S. Department of Agriculture had charged UCSF for 75 counts of animal welfare violations. &quot;The gravity of violations is great,&quot; the USDA complaint stated. A UCSF insider recently noted, &quot;Over the years, UCSF has had to cope with a handful of scientists who haven&apos;t always had the best attitude toward animals.&quot; Vivisectionist Stephen Lisberger was specifically listed in several of the charges. Now, the university has settled all of the violations by paying the fines for creating an atmosphere where employees are afraid to report complaints and several other charges. UCSF settled the case just days before formal hearings were scheduled to begin. By agreeing to the settlement, activists were disappointed that researchers were able to evade public scrutiny of the facts about their treatment of animals in the 600 to 800 experiments conducted at UCSF at any given time. Activists contend that the university seems especially determined to keep their researchers&apos; actions hidden from the public, which pays for their experiments with millions in tax dollars. In Defense of Animals ( IDA ) began a new round of demonstrations at UCSF last week, focusing on educating the public about what is taking place inside UCSF labs while encouraging insiders to &quot;blow the whistle&quot; on UCSF&apos;s animal cruelty.

 Portland Oct 04 2005 &quot;The United Nations cannot be reformed&quot;: Chavez tells the people of the US 

 President Chavez&apos;s recent visit to the United Nations on September 15th caused a major commotion in the United States. First of all, the Bush administration tried to block and delay the visit, so that Chavez&apos;s appearance would not coincide with Bush&apos;s at the United Nations ... But when Chavez finally spoke at the UN assembly he delivered a very powerful and damning speech. The main thrust of it was that the United Nations did not work and could not be reformed. However, he added that in the meantime three measures should be taken as a matter of urgency: the abolition of the right of veto in the Security Council, the inclusion of countries from the South on the council, and to move the UN outside of the United States since this was the country that had violated the most UN resolutions! ...

President Chavez...repeated his offer to supply cheap heating fuel to the poor communities in the United States so that poor people would not die of cold during the winter. He offered to do this through CITGO, the US subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned company PDVSA. [ Read More ] Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt; 

 Portland Oct 04 2005 ON LANGUAGE. WHO ARE THE REAL ECO-TERRORISTS? 

 The FBI scares the public by framing the threat as one coming from activists instead of coming from global warming, and earth destructive corporations. It is dangerous to adopt the rhetoric of the FBI, as Kelly Hearn of Alternet.org and other progressives seem to... Eco-activist, Jeff Free Luers is serving a 22 year 8 month sentence (twice the sentence received by the Abu Grahib sadists) for burning 3 SUV&apos;s at a deserted dealership in Oregon (not California). He once said, the &quot;REAL eco-terrorists, are the ones terrorizing our eco-systems&quot;. The terrorists are arguably companies such as Weyerhauser, Monsanto, Union Carbide and Halliburton, who have had an enormous destructive impact on both the natural world, and on human health. As Utah Philips said, these people &quot;have names and addresses.&quot;

Forms of dissent which cannot be easily controlled and safely neutralized like marching, voting, lobbying, letter writing, etc. are defined as &quot;terrorism.&quot; However, property destruction has been a part of American dissent since the Boston Tea Party.

 Portland Oct 04 2005 September Critical Mass 

 
This month&apos;s critical mass saw the PPB passionately enforcing lighting requirements with the obsessive linear misguidedness of a teen in lust. As a point of reference for this article I have pasted the OSR that was key in my interactions last night.

The ride started out with what appeared to be a one-to-one ration of bicycle officers to Critical Massers. Though the heavy down poor of rain severely limited the turn out last nights ride and lessened the disposition of the officers assigned to the ride ... for me (Jasun Wurster) this ride again reaffirmed why I feel Portland needs Critical Mass.

gray, wet and rolling

Last month only 3 tickets were handed out. More than I would like, but way better than a year ago. In August, one person who was ticketed seemed upbeat because he was warned by the police. (crossing the middle line and other somewhat petty stuff)

This month all seemed typical. I made it to the start just in time to see the mass rolling out on Burnside. We must have been at NW Park and Davis when I noticed a biker had the hilt of a sword sticking out of his backpack.

I jokingly razed him a little about all the weapons he was carrying. (the blade plus 2 u-locks) Alas, I should have kept my mouth shut. [ read more ]

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 04 2005 World Farm Animals Day at KFC in Santa Cruz 

 There were about a dozen people at the demonstration on Mission St. in Santa Cruz on October 2, World Farm Animals Day, to protest KFC. Mission St. is also Highway 1 and there were a lot of people that honked in support of the demonstration. Informational flyers were passed out to passing motorists, as well as customers who were both entering and leaving KFC. This particular demonstration lasted about an hour, and by the time we left, there were only two customers in the restaurant.

At one point, I was standing on the sidewalk and looking inside the KFC when an employee flipped me the bird - you know, gave me the middle finger. I was quite amused by this so I walked up to her and asked her if she wanted to do that again for the camera. She declined and told me she was going to sue me.

But I have to say, the KFC employee of the day award goes to the manager for running after me and kicking me in the upper thigh. It is too bad that Amy, a film student at Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, had stopped filming just seconds prior to him kicking me. However, for what it&apos;s worth, she recorded a statement saying that she witnessed the manager kick me.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 04 2005 Unanimous! 

 &quot;We hope you will give it your serious attention, and we look forward to your reply.&quot; 

On September 27th, the Santa Cruz City Council voted, UNANIMOUSLY, to resubmit a letter to the House Judiciary Committee of the United Sates Congress calling for the investigation and possible impeachment of all the members of the Bush Administration who have had anything to do with the war in Iraq, the &quot;war on terror,&quot; and/or the treatment of the prisoners of those wars.

 The original letter (.pdf) was sent on September 10th of 2003, but NO ANSWER was ever received! The HJC blew off both the Council and this Community!! In a moment of levity that got many laughs, Council Member Tim Fitzmaurice suggested that, this time, they send the letter &quot;certified, return receipt required&quot; and he would donate the money to do so!

Though the action in 2003 was reported world wide, what was not reported was the fact that in the 10 DAYS! following that vote, the council phone lines were jammed all day with calls from all over the country, from folks thanking and congratulating them for standing up and speaking out!! And that was two years ago!

The new cover letter, explaining why the Council is resubmitting their original letter, is copied below. Clearly, the evidence supporting the original concerns of this community has increased vastly in these last two years!! And in a recent poll taken after the release of the Downing Street Memos in May, over 47% of the people polled said they thought Bush should be impeached if he had lied about the reasons for invading Iraq.

 Right-wing ideologues are silently taking over our public media. Just when we thought Big Bird was safe, trouble has returned to Sesame Street. In fact, trouble never left. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the agency that oversees PBS and NPR, is the latest in a long line of institutions to suffer hostile takeovers by right-wing ideologues. Though Republicans’ attempt to de-fund the CPB in June backfired after setting off a public firestorm, the assault from within has run unabated, led by right-wing apparatchik and CPB chair, Kenneth Tomlinson.

 Madison Oct 04 2005 Earth Headed for Global Warming Catastrophe 

 A leading worldwide climate research institute in Hamburg, Germany predicted last week that the Earth is heading for a climate catastrophe in the next 100 years, with sea ice in the North Pole region predicted to completely melt in summer and extreme weather events increasing in both frequency and strength. The study is being followed up this week by the release of a report from the UK&apos;s Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to the presidency of the European Union, on the impact of climate change on migratory species. The report details and predicts major losses in many of the world&apos;s animal populations with continued global warming. The releases come on the heels of another release issued by National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), a part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which has reported that summer Arctic sea ice fell far below average for the fourth year, with winter ice seeing sharp declines, and spring melts beginning much earlier that even 10 years ago. Meanwhile, the U.S. mainstream media and government continue to abdicate their responsibility to appropriately inform and alert Americans to the growing threat of global warming, as well as the need for timely and responsive change to slow global warming through massive reductions in fuel burning and other greenhouse gas releasing sources.

 Boston Oct 05 2005 The Continuing Legacy of Abu Ghraib 

 Amman, Jordan -- Haj Ali is an Iraqi who was released from Abu Ghraib after five months when it was decided that he was “wrongfully arrested.” In the States many people seem to think that after the Abu Ghraib investigations, everything changed in Iraq, and this ended the mistreatment of prisoners that has often involved abuse at best and torture at worst. In fact these practices still go on, particularly in so-called “private prisons” and “party prisons.” I spoke with Haj Ali last night and he explained some of this to me. Haj Ali, who was prisoner number 151716, was taken to Abu Ghraib on the fifteenth of October 2003. He was kept there for five months until he was put on a truck, taken to the desert and dropped off on the highway. The soldiers told him he was free because he had been “wrongfully arrested.” Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 Portland Oct 06 2005 Washington Mutual Funds Vivisection @ HLS 

 America&apos;s supposedly hippest Bank has been caught (blood) red-handed investing in Huntingdon Life Sciences, HLS. HLS tests drugs like Vioxx, artificial sweeteners like Splenda, cigarette smoke, pesticides, and food colorings &quot;safe&quot; on animals - while humans die as a result of the ill-effects of these products.

The &apos;home of the free checking&apos; was also the home of guilt-free cruelty... until now. The Washington Mutual Group of Funds [High Yield Fund] holds 188,430 shares in Life Sciences Research (LSRI - OTCBB) which is the generically catchy holding company for HLS!

Washington Mutual invests people&apos;s hard-earned money in HLS without their disclosing the scope and nature of this business they are financially supporting.

 Binghamton Oct 06 2005 The Killing of Filiberto Ojeda Ríos 

 PUERTO RICO is a not-quite-this, not-quite-that sort of place: a part of the United States but culturally and linguistically very Spanish, politically American but technically a &quot;commonwealth&quot;, not a state, whose people pay no federal taxes and have no vote in presidential elections. For some, this is a satisfactory equilibrium; for others, a half-way house on the way to statehood. For Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, it was a form of purgatory, an unwelcome condition between the hell of Spanish colonialism and the relatively celestial end-point of independence. But since independence was awkwardly neither desired by most Puerto Ricans nor offered by the other citizens of the United States, he would fight for it and, if need be, die for it. This he did, in a shoot-out with the FBI at a farmhouse in western Puerto Rico last Friday. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 Portland Oct 06 2005 KBOO supernova 

 KBOO is currently in a last sprint to prise $220 K from a reluctant CPB. Among the Staff and the Board, this is viewed as a worthwhile goal, but as only a part of the Pledge Drive. We&apos;ve defied CPB cuts before, and we sailed past the Republican &quot;death sentence&quot; cuts years ago, because we decided to take our case directly to the people. This is in contrast to other &quot;community radio&quot; stations around the nation, who buckled under to Federal pressure to abandon dissenting commentary and &quot;real news&quot; in favor of boutique, balkanized ethno-music schedules. If we get the CPB money (based on a harsh deadline), great, and if we don&apos;t, the Feds can screw themselves!
At present, KBOO seems to be building a greater national presence (see KBOO.FM). Despite some problems with maintaining news department continuity, we are on track to start up some decent reporting. And the Internet has had the effect of breaking the AP News propaganda buzz. We hope to do more local reporting soon.

 As part of a national anti-sweatshop campaign taking place at over 40 colleges and universities in the U.S., students and workers from UC Santa Cruz held a rally and march to demand that UCSC apparel no longer be produced in sweatshops.

The marchers, a few of whom had family members currently working in sweatshops overseas or have had personal experiences themselves, initially educated the many passerbys in busy Baytree Plaza before marching to the Chancellor&apos;s office where a list of demands was presented to an administrative representative. Their follow-through will be closely watched.

 Yesterday, I attended a public hearing on the current Time Warner Cable contract, currently presented before City Council for approval.

The fact that 50-75 people showed up was pretty amazing, especially for something seemingly so mundane as a cable contract renewal. Equally amazing is that so many turned out when there was no mention of the hearing in Wednesday&apos;s edition of our Gannett daily, the Press and Sun Bulletin (PSB).

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 06 2005 Parent Leaders Support Head Start Workers&apos; Vote to Strike Over Non-Economic Issues 

 The Santa Cruz County Community Counseling Center (SCCCC), the parent corporation for the Head Start Program, publicly expressed disbelief that workers would be willing to strike over non-economic issues. Parent Leader Paola Rojas says she understands easily.

According to Rojas, elected parent leaders who make up the Parent Policy Council have submitted no fewer than three petitions to the agency in the past twelve-months. Federal mandates require that parents have a say in how the program is run along with the agency’s Board of Trustees. “But SCCCC has done everything it can to stop us” says Rojas. Not only have petitions been ignored but Administrators have attempted to intimidate us and walked out of meetings when confronted.

Workers, too, say the agency is not listening. Last week, they voted to give their negotiators strike authorization. The message to SCCCC is that time is running out. For workers, the long negotiation process has deepened divisions with the agency. Workers voted for a union because of heavy-handed agency actions; the difficult negotiations have only strengthened the workers’ resolve. Agency non-responsiveness to workers and parent leaders has convinced workers that they must hold out for binding arbitration to assure fairness when grievances arise.

 It&apos;s been 13 years since the first “Commute Clot” brought together about 50 bicyclists at “PeeWee” Herman Plaza at the foot of Market Street in San Francisco. Within a few short months it had gained the moniker “Critical Mass” and the excitement and euphoria and sheer novelty of an “organized coincidence” that fills the streets with bicycles instead of cars was rapidly reproducing itself across the planet. Now there are websites galore documenting Critical Masses in towns everywhere, from Australia to Italy, Chile to Canada. Of the more than 400 places where Critical Mass rides have taken place, hundreds continue to ride every month.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 07 2005 Safavian, Abramoff, DeLay, And The K Street Project 

 The separation of the Bush political machine from organized crime is often like the thin layer of rock between a seemingly ordinary surface and volcanic activity rumbling below. Sometimes, the lava spews forth and the illusion of normalcy is shattered. In the weeks ahead, a dangerous eruption is again threatening to shake the Bush family’s image of legitimacy, as the pressure from intersecting scandals builds.
So far, the mainstream news media has focused mostly on the white-collar abuses of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay for allegedly laundering corporate donations to help Republicans gain control of the Texas legislature, or on deputy White House chief of staff Karl Rove for disclosing the identity of a covert CIA officer to undercut her husband’s criticism of George W. Bush’s case for war in Iraq.
Both offenses represent potential felonies, but they pale beside new allegations linking business associates of star GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff – an ally of both DeLay and Rove – to the gangland-style murder of casino owner Konstantinos “Gus” Boulis in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2001. These criminal cases also are reminders of George H.W. Bush’s long record of unsavory associations, including with a Nicaraguan contra network permeated by cocaine traffickers, Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s multi-million-dollar money-laundering operations, and anti-communist Cuban extremists tied to acts of international terrorism. 
 &quot;How Rotten Are These Guys?&quot; Robert Parry, Consortium News 

 Safavian, Former Chief Procurement Officer for the OMB 
On October 5th, 2005 , David Safavian, was accused in the federal grand jury indictment of making false statements to investigators. Safavian was arrested on September 19th, three days after resigning from his job as the chief procurement officer for the Office of Management and Budget. The charges against Safavian go back to his former position as chief of staff at the General Services Administration. While he was in that position he is accused of taking gifts from Jack Abramoff and covering up help he allegedly gave Abramoff, who was pursuing land deals with the General Services Administration. As Chief Procurement Officer for the OMB, Safavian helped create the rules for federal reconstruction contracts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
 Jack Abramoff, Lobyist&amp;Republican Activist 
Abramoff is a central figure in a series of high-profile political scandals linked to the Republican Party. He is currently under investigation by grand juries in Washington, D.C., for his involvement in the Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal, and by a grand jury in Guam over a separate matter. He was indicted on August 11, 2005 , by a third grand jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for bank fraud arising out of an unrelated business deal.
Abramoff also is under investigation for his ties to the murder of Konstantinos Boulis ; in September 2005 , police charged three men in the 2001 gangland-style slaying of the Florida businessman who was gunned down in his car months after selling a casino cruise line to a group that included Jack Abramoff. Two of the three men charged had been hired as consultants by Adam Kidan, one of Abramoff&apos;s partners in the SunCruz Casinos venture. The men accused of the murder are allegedly connected to the Gambino crime family, but had received money from Abramoff in the months before the murder.
The investigations and indictments of Abramoff have taken on significant national importance because of the lobbyist&apos;s close political connections with leading national Republicans, including President of the United States George W. Bush. Congressman Tom DeLay, former Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, has called Abramoff one of his “closest and dearest friends.” Abramoff also has been a leading George W. Bush political fundraiser.
 Tom DeLay, Former House Majority Leader 
On September 28th, 2005 , a Texas grand jury indicted House Majority leader Tom DeLay (R - Texas) and two political associates, charging them with a conspiracy to violate Texas campaign finance laws.
 The K Street Project 
The K Street Project is little known outside the Washington beltway and its effectiveness as a political stratagem is only possible because of the unique importance of campaign finance to American politics. DeLay, together with Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and some conservative activists conceived the notion 10 years ago that they should use the Republican majority in the House as a lever to ensure that the lobbyists, law firms and trade associations that inhabit Washington&apos;s K Street, heart of the industry, should only employ Republicans or sympathisers. It worked. The most influential Washington lobbyist is Barbour, Griffiths and Rogers; it employs not a single Democrat. Last year, in a classic operation, House Republicans let the Motion Picture Association of America (the film industry lobby group) know that appointing a Democrat, Dan Glickman, as its head would mean $1.5 billion of tax relief for the film industry was now in peril. Glickman staffed up the MPAA with Republicans, but the threat remains. In 2003, the Republican National Committee could claim that 33 of the top 36 top-level K Street positions were in Republican hands. Today, it&apos;s even closer to a clean sweep.

 Around 7 pm on October 5, 2005 the NYPD removed bicycles locked to the entrance of the Bedford Avenue L station in Williamsburg. Although signs indicate property attached to these MTA railings will be removed, there was no such warning for bicycles removed from nearby signposts. In fact, according to NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law Article 24, Section 1115, it is completely legal to lock a bicycle to a signpost, lamppost, bus stop pole, parking meter or any other public street fixture as long as it does not alter or interfere with the operation of public traffic signals and signs.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 07 2005 Students and Workers Teach Republicans a Lesson in Solidarity 

 On Thursday, UCSC&apos;s College Republicans held a rally against the striking Metro bus drivers. While publicized all over campus, only a handful of students showed up to join them.

However, having heard of the anti-worker rally, students from the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) and the Student and Worker Coalition for Justice (SWCJ), who have been very active supporting the bus drivers, were quick to react. They carpooled down to the rally and had far outnumbered the Republicans even before they arrived. While the mainstream media jumped at the opportunity to discredit the bus drivers&apos; union (UTU Local 23), the pro-worker students showed that UCSC is overwhelmingly in solidarity with the bus drivers.

On Monday at UCSC, over 50 students and workers walked into Mike Rotkin&apos;s office, resulting in his acknowledgement that the Transit Board made a bad decision. On Friday, students and workers from UCSC will march at 4pm from the base of campus to the downtown Metro Center to show their solidarity.

 Rochester Oct 07 2005 Rochester Food Not Bombs is Back! 

 [ permalink ] In light of the unfortunate eviction of Friends Helping Friends , a group of Rochester activists has decided to take up the challenge of rebuilding Food not Bombs in our community.

We are hoping to get donations from the Public Market and other local businesses. Our goal is to feed people off of the surplus wealth of our community. We need as many volunteers as possible to gather food, flyer , cook and distribute.

Right now the plan is to set up in Highland Park on Sunday at 2 pm and feed people, starting this Sunday October 9th. This is likely to change once the weather starts getting colder.

We know there is a demand for food in Rochester; there is a staggering amount of poverty and isolation in this city. True to Food not Bombs principles , we operate by consensus and seek the most effective strategies for getting people fed. No hierarchy, no leaders --we welcome everyone&apos;s participation. Right now, we are just in the process of getting the ball rolling and letting the word out, so let&apos;s see what happens! Together, we can achieve great things!

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 07 2005 Santa Cruz Billboard Shows Remarkable Candor 

 Santa Cruz, CA, October 7th, 2005: A Red Cross advertisement on Santa Cruz County&apos;s only remaining billboard, the &quot;whale billboard&quot; along Highway 17, was modified today by the Billboard Liberation Front who struck in the name of truth-in-advertising.

Where before the billboard exhorted people to give to the Red Cross, the added text reads &quot;&apos;cuz the government ain&apos;t doing squat.&quot;

This became painfully clear in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. It was revealed that not only had the Bush administration pulled funding for levy repair in New Orleans to fund the war in Iraq, but left National Guard troops unavailable in the wake of the disaster. The largely poor and black sections of the city were left without food, water, or relief. Critics of the government’s response to the disaster, pointed out that government response to the disaster was inadequate at best, and In many cases made a bad situation worse.

 Chicago Oct 07 2005 Minister Calls for Police Accountability in Wake of Settlement to Framed Brutality Victim 

 [ permalink ] Local activists charge that Chicago police remain unaccountable to the rule of law, despite the City of Chicago�s announcement on Monday that it will pay $1.75 million to a police brutality victim officers tried to frame for going public about his abuse.

A City Council committee agreed to the settlement with Jeremiah Mearday, who was beaten by two white police officers in 1997. The City eventually fired the two officers who beat the black youth. But two weeks after their firing, police arrested Mearday again, claiming that they found drugs on him and that he assaulted officers. The drug charges were eventually dropped and Mearday was acquitted of assault � lending veracity to the charge that cops planted the drugs and fabricated the assault charge as retaliation for the firing of the two officers that beat Mearday. Monday�s settlement covers civil rights suits for both cases.

&quot;Jeremiah and his family have suffered enormously,&quot; says Rev. Paul Jakes of the Christian Council on Urban Affairs, one of the lead groups in marshalling support for Mearday and his family. &quot;But that suffering continues throughout the city, because violent officers know they will never be held to the same standards of justice that the rest of us must face � while we live under the risk of unprovoked police violence, fabricated evidence, and worse. This is no different than the sort of impunity one finds in the worst sort of dictatorships.&quot;

 Portland Oct 08 2005 FOUR MONTHS AGO, 42% of the USA wanted to see BUSH IMPEACHED. What&apos;s it up to now? 

 To date, only one pollster, Zogby International, has inquired about public opinion regarding the impeachment of George Bush. That was four months ago. Zogby found that 42 percent of respondents would favor impeachment if Bush &quot;did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq.&quot; Other polls show that something around a majority of Americans are now convinced that Bush and his crew did, indeed, not tell the truth. The implication is clear: if the corporate media would raise the issue of popular opinion on impeachment, they would find evidence for strong public support. But only Zogby raised the issue, and even they refuse to ask the question again unless somebody pays them to do so. This, as Bush&apos;s polling numbers continue to fall, indicating that there is probably more support for impeachment now than there was back in June.

 For many communities, government aid has been virtually absent and supplies are only coming in from grassroots relief efforts. Though hope and humor persist, the challenge continues to grow. The more populous indian communities in Terrebonne Parish such as Dulac, DuLarge, Grand Caillou, Montegut, Pointe-au-Chien and Isle de Jean Charles escaped extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina but became victims to the storm surge of Hurricane Rita. Another 4000 people were forced from their homes by eight feet of flood waters and a four inch layer of mud.

Despite the compassionate aid that has flowed into the these communities, STORM RELIEF IS STILL AN URGENT NEED. Supplies needed include: 1) Cleaning materials; 2) Sheets, linens, towels and other basic household items; 3) Construction materials; 4) Toiletry items; 5) Baby items; 6) Children&apos;s needs; 7) Campers, RVs, trailers and other forms of temporary housing, especially for elders; 8) Gas and gift cards. In addition to supplies, VOLUNTEER WORK TEAMS ARE URGENTLY NEEDED ...

 Rochester Oct 09 2005 Victory for Locked-out Workers at Interface Solutions! 

 [ permalink ] &quot;VICTORY AT INTERFACE!!!!&quot; were the first words I read in a forwarded email sent to me on Oct. 8th by Jason Crane, a local organizer for UNITE-HERE.

The email continues, &quot;The workers at Interface Solutions - represented by UNITE-HERE Local 701T - have agreed to a new contract that puts them back to work. The agreement is a big improvement over management&apos;s &apos;last, best and final&apos; offer back in July.&quot;

Workers at Interface Solutions in Fulton, NY had been working without a contract since July 1. On August 13, workers were effectively and forcefully locked out , thrown on the street against their will. Workers on shift were removed by security guards; those not on shift were given a simple phone call and told not to come in to work. Scabs were sent in from out of town to continue with production.

Workers&apos; grievances stemmed from a long history top-down abuse from management headed by Deborah Morris. Morris and company had been working on gutting retiree benefits, incentive bonuses, health coverage for workers and their families and cutting salaries among other things. All of these abusive and anti-worker actions were embedded in the management-created contract (before the contract was canned in August). Not one worker voted in favor of this contract.

It did not take long for the workers, all of them members of Local 701T - UNITE-HERE , to organize. Alan Bryant, a union representative based out of NYC, was called in to offer help and lend a hand. Legal actions were eventually taken – charges have been filed on behalf of the UNITE-HERE union workers and their families that the lockout is in fact illegal . As of this writing, the status of the lawsuit is unknown.

The workers demanded their jobs back, accompanied with a fair contract and won both. The future will tell if the perpetrators of crimes against workers will recieve their comeupance. To honor the victory, a rally will be held in front of the factory outside of Fulton on Route 481, Monday Oct. 10th at 6:45 AM. 

The email concludes, &quot;This lockout has lasted seven weeks - and these workers won this fight because of their solidarity and the solidarity of people like YOU! We raised over $8000 for the workers, sent many messages to the company to end the lockout, and gave support on the picket line and at rallies. Everyone should take heart in this victory! This victory shows what labor can accomplish when we support each other.&quot; Read the full article here.

 Racism and poverty are not only two struggles with one goal but, realities of how I lived in an all black neighborhood facing poverty but was bused to a majority white school to endure racism. There is a segment of the population ran and ruled by a group of people who have power and privilege because of their ethnic group; while another population is allowed to suffer from poverty, inadequate education, and injustices because of their ethnic group.

 Portland Oct 09 2005 Oct 10: Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People 

 What does it mean for the U.S. to celebrate Columbus? Indigenous people have resisted the legacy of Columbus and still resist similar threats today. Together we can transform October 10th, 2005 in to a celebration of the self-governance and continued liberation of Indigenous People, exposing the legacy of Columbus&apos; cruel inhumanity and embracing our histories and memories of resistance.
In celebration of our common histories, we will march from Woodruff Park to Sylvester Park where we will celebrate Indigenous People&apos;s Day with our communities.

Meet at Woodruff Park @4:00pm
Leave @ 4:30 heading east on Harrison Ave.
Arrive at Sylvester Park for awesome speakers @ 5:30pm

 Portland Oct 09 2005 Eugene Set To Vote On External Police Review Boards 

 I wrote this more with the town I used to live in on my mind, but it applies to Portland too I think. Page 28 of the Eugene Weekly has a two column two inch bar with an endorsement for voting YES to a proposal to have the city council hire an outside independent civilian review board all the time.
Quite farther along than just about any city I&apos;ve ever lived in, I&apos;ll tell you. They should take a note or two from Eugene - the only city I know named after the first name of a famous environmentalist! Just like when the Portland mayor asked for twinkle fingers as consensus in a Tuesday night meeting to reject Homeland Security presence last year. But you know what? It shouldn&apos;t be only in Oregon, and it shouldn&apos;t be only in Eugene, lemme tell you.
Here&apos;s the Eugene scoop: www.yeson20-106.org . Adapt it to whatever town YOU&apos;RE sitting in.

People around Boston and Connecticut have been crying out for CivRevBo&apos;s since long before I was born. In fact, Angela Davis did a year for inciting a riot once and it&apos;s uncertain whether it was her yelling that diapers and milk should be free in all stores, or from her yelling that Massachussetts needs civilian reviewboards. I have it all on hearsay and it&apos;s a little before my time, but I&apos;m told that was around 1962!!!

 Portland Oct 09 2005 Communique from Rob Los Ricos: Why Nov 11? 

 Let&apos;s reclaim Nov 11 as a day of anarchist action. &quot;I want November 11 to be a day when everyone-and anarchists in particular-examines the conditions of their lives and how they compare to the wealthiest 5% of the population.&quot;
November 11 is a national holiday?a day to remember the many American lives lost fighting this country&apos;s wars. Why November 11? To bury this country&apos;s radical past. On November 11, 1887, four anarchist labor organizers, agitators and propagandists were hung in Chicago. Their crime? They suggested workers be allowed an 8 hour workday.

Long before their trial, mainstream newspapers were demanding blood. They wanted the government to kill all union members along with their families. Protests in solidarity with the condemned men were massive and worldwide. When the first 4 were executed, international outrage and the fury of the U.S. workforce compelled the government to pardon three of the remaining prisoners.

Remember that the liberal society created by the bloodshed of the Class War has been obliterated by international trade organizations, corporate power and government collusion with international banking interests. I also ask you to come to grips with the idea that we?everyone not among the wealthiest 5% of the world&apos;s population?we are all Iraqis now.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 09 2005 Gulf Coast Communities Still Need Help from Santa Cruz 

 Local resident Curtis Reliford, a community organizer and founder of &quot;Brothers Teaching Brothers,&quot; will be returning to the Gulf Coast region for a second trip to supply much-needed supplies. (See also: &quot;Thank You Santa Cruz!&quot; from Shreveport, Bogalousa and New Orleans, Louisiana ). I have begun traveling through the region in advance to see what supplies are needed where. The past few days we have been traveling through Texas to find shelters, mostly serving Hurrican Rita survivors.

Yesterday, we stopped in Winnie, where a community center has been working with the Red Cross to serve the community and displaced Katrina survivors. While the shelter should be closing soon, many of the remaining survivors still do not know where their family is and have nohwere to go.

Today we traveled further East and saw more severe destruction. In Nederland we found Triumph Church, which had its sign blown over but is serving as a major relief center for the surroundign area. We met with Daemon Scapin, the head pastor, who told us that they have been feeding thousands of people each day. The will be shifting their strategy from providing first-response aid (food, water, and medicine) to providing and transporting supplies that will assist residents in cleaning up their homes.

Futher north on I-69, outside of Beaumont, we found hundreds of cars parked at the Church of the Rock where more residents were registering for aid and recieving meals. We met with Robert Benlien, a pastor there who is coordinating supplies. When asked what supplies they need, he replied, &quot;everything.&quot; Apparantly, all they have recieved from FEMA is napkins and paper towels.

URGENT Relief Needed for Native American Communities in Louisiana
The Native American tribes of the Houma, Pointe-au-Chien, and Biloxi Chitimacha of southern Louisiana have faced a monumental struggle in channeling relief efforts to their tribal members devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. For many communities, government aid has been virtually absent and supplies are only coming in from grassroots relief efforts.

Though hope and humor persist, the challenge continues to grow. The more populous indian communities in Terrebonne Parish such as Dulac, DuLarge, Grand Caillou, Montegut, Pointe-au-Chien and Isle de Jean Charles escaped extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina but became victims to the storm surge of Hurricane Rita. Another 4000 people were forced from their homes by eight feet of flood waters and a four inch layer of mud.

The rising tides from Hurricane Rita also breeched recently repaired levees in Plaquemines, St. Bernard and lower Jefferson Parishes, re-flooding communities that were beginning to dry out from the 150 mph winds and storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina. There is concern, that without immediate assistance in the form of elder care, cleaning, and rebuilding of damaged homes, community members may move away from the area fragmenting traditions and culture.

 Some people consider it Columbus Day, but as that is widely considered a celebration of 500 years of genocide, many have reclaimed the day as Indigenous People&apos;s Day.

In honor of this day, we will be playing audio recordings of the recent Zapatista Encuentros, brought back from Chiapas Mexico by a member of our collective. The Zapatistas are currently planning a new campaign called La Otra Campaña, or The Other Campaign.

 NYC Oct 10 2005 Watergate Is Dead 

 Watergate-- or rather, the myth of what Watergate was-- is dead. Like many aging corpses, the myth shows signs of a long, slow decline into irrelevant senility; nevertheless, the final blows have been painful to watch.

The coup de grace came on Friday afternoon, known to politicians and media watchers alike as “document dumping” day, the time when bad news is buried by the weekend in order to avoid media scrutiny. This time, however, it seems that it was the media itself that did the dumping. “A New York Times reporter has given investigators notes from a conversation she had with a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney weeks earlier than was previously known,” wrote Reuters late Friday. “Reporter Judith Miller discovered the notes -- from a June 2003 conversation she had with Cheney&apos;s chief of staff, Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby -- after her testimony before the grand jury last week.” Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 10 2005 Referendum On Iraqi Constitution October 15th 

 On October 15th, 2005 , Iraq is scheduled to hold a referendum on its future Constitution.
The International Crisis Group has criticized what it termed &quot;Iraq&apos;s rushed constitutional process,” saying it has deepened ethnic and sectarian rifts and is likely to worsen the &quot;insurgency&quot; and hasten the country&apos;s violent break-up. There is widespread opposition among Sunnis, Turkomen, women and supporters of Moqtada Sadr. Clerics and tribal leaders from Iraq&apos;s Sunni Arab minority have expressed optimism that they can mobilize their communities to reject the draft constitution . The Iraqi National Dialogue Assembly, which has started to collect signatures for its petition opposing the constitution, has also gained the support of leading Shia tribes in southern and central Iraq. Many women in Iraq worry that the new Constitution will be a setback for their rights and allow discriminatory laws against women that have not existed in Iraq for decades.

 Portland Oct 11 2005 sten timber sale: treesitters still under fire 

 Yesterday (Sunday), another attempt was made to murder a treesitter in the Sten timber sale in the McKenzie watershed. The activist reported that &quot;bullets whizzed through the branches over his head.&quot; On Friday hired climbers came to the base of the tree and threatened to remove the sitter.
Forest Service Law Enforecement officials have done nothing to protect activists from violence at Sten, despite names being given and official reports being filed at the Willamette National Forest headquarters in Eugene. The same white pickup with toolbox (license # YBK 722), whose driver previously fired both .45 caliber shells and hunting arrows at treesitters, has returned and travels throughout the area with impunity.

Freres Lumber of Mill City is currently decimating the old growth ecosystems of the Sten timber sale. Logging, hauling, and bulldozing continue within 100 meters of the tree &quot;Katrina&quot; which has been occupied for over a month. The treesitter was visited and cheered on last Thursday by a large group of schoolchildren from Eugene.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 11 2005 Students, Workers and Community Unite to Support Bus Drivers 

 Students and Workers Take Protest to Sentinel&apos;s Door 

Friday, Oct. 7, 2005 - Continuing the hard-fought struggle to support local bus drivers on strike , hundreds of students and workers from UC Santa Cruz, as well as many community members, held a brief rally at the base of the UCSC campus before embarking upon a highly visible and chant-filled march to the downtown Metro Center.

Once at the Metro Center, a rally and speak-out was held to discuss the bus drivers&apos; struggle and the great deal of solidarity between various sectors of the community. After many complaints of the Santa Cruz Sentinel&apos;s poor coverage of the strike, the community marched over to the Sentinel&apos;s offices to greet the origins of their frusteration.

Friday&apos;s action, organized by the Student and Worker Coalition for Justice (SWCJ) , has been the strongest show of support in the almost two week-old strike.

Early last week, students and workers descended on Mike Rotkin&apos;s office , leading to his denouncement of the Transit Board&apos;s decision that led to the strike. A few days later, a College Republican attempt at an anti-worker rally sank amidst overwhelming UTU solidarity.

Rotkin has called for an emergency Transit Board meeting Tuesday.

 Portland Oct 11 2005 DC demonstrators bio-attack: update 

 
It would appear now that the Homeland Security alert regarding tularemia is being &apos;spun.&apos; As the antiwar demonstrators did their thing in DC in late September, biowar sensors at the Capitol registered unusual amounts of tularemia. Now they are suggesting that perhaps the feet of the demonstrators stirred up the bacteria from the soil--but if that were true, why has no other demonstration stirred up a US biowar arsenal bacterium?

Tularemia is perfect for attacking demonstrators. It doesn&apos;t spread, so there would be no contagious &apos;outbreak.&apos; Now that they are dispersed across the nation, their symptoms will (would) appear to be similar to the common cold--muscle aches, mild fever, etc. The symptoms are unlikely to be diagnosed without a larger national awareness, however, and they slowly progress to painful and disfiguring conditions and then death (see my post from last Friday on this subject). Hence the attack could pass completely unnoticed except for the condition of the demonstrators and their grieving families. The only notice might be in a spike of tularemia cases in the following years&apos; CDC reports. [ read more ]

 Portland Oct 11 2005 Trudell&apos;s Message - Coherence and Consciousness 

 
i was skipping up the front stairs of the EMU - making my way to the ballroom to get myself a front row seat to see John Trudell - when i heard his voice being carried on the current of the wind, captivating a crowd gathered round in the outdoor free speech plaza.

Trudell, along with Wilma Mankiller, were featured speakers at the University of Oregon for this years anti-Columbus, Indigenous Solidarity Day. I was unfamiliar with Native-American Wilma Mankiller, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but always make a point of seeing Trudell whenever he makes an appearance in Eugene. The last time was seven years ago, so i was eager to hear what Trudell had to say after such a long hiatus. Always when i hear him speak it is like a shot of reality that lends clarity to my life.

i didn&apos;t attend with the intention of taking notes and writing his rant into an article, but he has such a lot of good shit to say that i wanted to pass it on, which was part of his message when someone asked how we can deal with the almighty media. In response he urged us to speak *coherently* and *consciously* to those who are willing to listen, but not to try and make converts of anyone. The &quot;Power of the People&quot; says Trudell, is in our &quot;coherent, conscious thoughts&quot;, and our ability to *think*, which will generate the energy that is needed. [ read more ]

 Portland Oct 11 2005 A Gathering Storm 

 While we think about the staggering revelations from the aftermath of the storm that shook this nation to its core, maybe we should think a little deeper, and a little closer to home. Most of us found it horrifying to realize that human beings could be treated like so much waste down in New Orleans, only because they were poor, or because they were black. We did not want to see ourselves in that mirror. But most of us are still blind to the same conditions in our own city. It&apos;s time to open our eyes.

I was late for work this morning, as usual. So as I hastened down Couch street, I almost did not want to see the police cruiser pulling to a slow halt nearby, along the 405 onramp. He wasn&apos;t stopping for me, but I knew what he was doing. I tried to tell myself it would be all right to just keep walking, to pretend I did not know what was going on. But I did know. I&apos;ve lived in this city for a long time. And I could not just walk on by.

As the cruiser eased itself to a stop, the door swung lazily open, and a fresh-faced young officer, squeaky clean and impressively professional, stepped out. I watched him wander nonchalantly over to an old man laying on the cold ground, nestled in a thick woolen blanket between the hard retaining wall and a squat bush covered with thorns. Damn, I thought. I&apos;m really gonna be late for work. I shook off the trivial thought, and walked back up the street to stand nearby, just near enough to be an obvious witness, but not so close as to be arrested for interfering. There was nothing else I could do. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt; 

 Portland Oct 11 2005 Will global warming lead to an &apos;ice age&apos; 

 
In order for a true ice age to occur, it is required that temperatures in the summer drop to such low levels that it effectively remains winter all year round. Snow that falls in the winter therefore never does melt, but rather continues to accumulate, and the end result is an &apos;ice age&apos;, and the creation of ice sheets as much as two miles thick, the result of annual accumulation of snow cover over many centuries. A few hundred years ago a not very well understood climate event took place, typically referred to by the misnomer &apos;the little ice age.&apos; Because this climate event has been misnamed as &apos;an ice age&apos;, this has led to some rampant speculation on the internet that &apos;global warming causes an ice age.&apos; This is not true. [ read more ] 

Signs of rapid arctic warming since 2000
 Permanent Arctic Ice Cap in 1979According to statements released by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, acceleration of melting in the arctic has caused scientists studying the phenomena to revise their estimates of the effect of climate change in the arctic. Previously it was typical to estimate that the arctic would be ice free by the year 2100, but the new data would suggest that the process may be complete by the year 2060. According to NSIDC, &quot;September 2005 will set a new record minimum in the amount of Arctic sea ice cover. It&apos;s the least sea ice we&apos;ve seen in the satellite record, and continues a pattern of extreme low extents of sea ice which we&apos;ve now seen for the last four years.&quot; [ read more ] 


Arctic Ice cover at new record low
 Permanent Arctic Ice Cap in 2003The permanent, year round Arctic ice cap has been shrinking at an average rate of 9 per cent per decade over the last two and half decades. The first image shows the extent of the ice cap in 1979. The second displays the ice cap in 2003. The animation covers the period from 1979 to 2003. The rate of Arctic ice melt has increased in recent years, achieving new record lows in each of the last four years, and this can be clearly seen towards the very end of the animation. The melt continues to break previous records in everyone of the last four years, and there are indications that the rate of change is now increasing, which is raising concerns that the arctic is now locked into a self reinforcing feedback loop. Ice is bright white, and thus reflective, and bounces heat and light energy back into space, while water absorbs and stores heat energy. As the ice shrinks, the ability of heat to build in the arctic increases, which then increases the rate of melt, which exposes more water surface, storing more heat, and a feedback loop is then created which results in acceleration of the rate of change.

 San Diego Oct 11 2005 Minuteman Attacks Protester - Video 

 Here&apos;s a perfectly clear video of the Scottish Rite Center protest where a volunteer with the Minutemen tackles protester. Later, he tells the police that he was assaulted and the police handcuff and detain this protester for an hour. As always, the police defend the violent racists.

While the violence at the border, with over 3,500 murdered by Operation Gatekeeper, 4 shootings, two fatal, in the area of the Minutemen patrols, and perpetual violence from the Border Patrol, continues on a daily basis, the racist vigilantes are contributing to make the situation even more grave for migrant people. The Minutemen have demonstrated again and again that they are violent and their project is a project of violence. Still, they continually lie to the corporate media and to the public about their true intentions, claiming that they are only a &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; when in fact they are a paramilitary group with guns, shooting ranges and violent intentions.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 11 2005 Caregivers from California Pacific Medical Center on Strike 

 Over 800 California Pacific Medical Center caregivers have been walking the picket lines in San Francisco since September 13th . On August 28th , a federal mediator issued a compromise to SEIU-UHW and Sutter CPMC as a settlement of the issues to avoid a strike – a compromise proposal that would establish the same quality of care standards that are currently in place at hospitals across California.
The United Healthcare West Bargaining Team accepted the compromise. Sutter CPMC accepted it as well, but Sutter backtracked and went back on their acceptance. The workers want Sutter CPMC to accept the Federal Mediator’s neutral proposal – accepting standards that hospitals across California already have in place- and end the strike. A variety of political and community activists are standing with the striking caregivers and urging Sutter to “Just Say Yes.” Recent speakers at rallies have included the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Dolores Huerta.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 11 2005 World Farm Animals Day at KFC in Santa Cruz 

 October 2nd was World Farm Animals Day. Established in 1983, it is now a day when people in all 50 states and two dozen countries memorialize the suffering and death of 50 billion cows, pigs, turkeys, chickens, and other sentient animals in the world&apos;s factory farms and slaughterhouses every year. The specific date was chosen as it marks the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, an outspoken advocate for the humane treatment of animals.
In Santa Cruz, The Progressive Animal Rights Alliance chose to mark the day by demonstrating at the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Mission Street in an ongoing effort to draw attention to KFC&apos;s refusal to implement guidelines developed by its own animal welfare panelists for the treatment of the almost 800,000,000 chickens it processes every year. About a dozen activists handed out informational flyers to passing motorists and customers entering and leaving the fast-food restaurant. One KFC employee showed her displeasure with the demonstration by flipping the bird to the demonstrators and the outlet&apos;s manager kicked one activist in front of customers and another witness.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 11 2005 Timber Cutting Continues in Sequoia National Monument! 

 Despite a recent federal court ruling, timber cutting continues in and near the Sequoia National Monument. On September 9th, Justice Charles Breyer from the US District Court for the northern district of California halted logging on a 2,000 acre commercial logging project called the Saddle fuel reduction sale. However, the ruling left open the fate of the Ice, White, and Frog timber sales, all of which are areas contiguous with or in the immediate proximity of the Saddle project. The focus of Breyer’s ruling was the absence of credible scientific evidence in the Forest Service’s guidelines for these timber sales. Of particular concern was the critical condition of the Pacific fisher population in the southern Sierras. Further decrease in canopy cover and disruption of fisher habitat could likely bring about the extinction of the species (the Bush administration has refused to accept the recommendation of scientists for listing the southern fisher as an endangered species). Sierra Nevada Earth First! activists were in the woods again this past weekend surveying timber sale units in the Frog, White, and Ice sale areas. : Read reports from Earth First! activists here .

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 12 2005 DIY Guide to Santa Cruz 

 An Incomplete List of Independent Local Projects 

Meaningful projects begin with people who are motivated to put into action their desires for the kind of world in which they want to live. The more we create our own projects that are apart from and in some cases pose a direct challenge to the dominant institutions, the more vital and meaningful our world(s) will be for us. Here is a short list of some of these kinds of projects in Santa Cruz.

[ Anarchist Library || The Bike Church || Food Not Bombs || Free Radio Santa Cruz || Free Skool Santa Cruz || Guerilla Drive-In || Santa Cruz Indymedia ]

Of course there is much more going on around town than this short list encompasses. Keep your eyes and ears open; talk to others (word of mouth is the best way to learn about what&apos;s going-on) and look for flyers around town (a great DIY way to spread-the-word). Also, if you discover that there is that vital something not happening here, then do-it-yourself and spread-the-word (collaborate with allies with similar passions). Let&apos;s joyfully tear down the world around us and create something wonderful in its place. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt; 

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 12 2005 Stanley&quot;Tookie&quot;Williams Faces Execution in 2006 if Clemency Not Granted 

 On October 11th, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams&apos; appeal to investigate the racism and discrimination at the heart of the case, as well as Tookie&apos;s innocence issues. The prosecutor in Tookie&apos;s original case removed all of the Black jurors from the jury, leaving an all-white jury to deliberate the case. During the trial, this prosecutor made racially-coded remarks during his closing argument, comparing Williams to a Bengal tiger in a zoo, and stating that a black community - South Central Los Angeles - was equivalent to the natural &quot;habitat&quot; of a Bengal Tiger.

The Supreme Court&apos;s refusal to investigate racism in this case establishes as &quot;case law&quot; for the nation the right for prosecutors to exclude jurors on the basis of race and to denigrate minority defendants in front of all-white juries. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals posited in 2002 that Tookie&apos;s prison writings, in which he renounces his former life as a gangster, could be grounds for the California governor to grant him clemency. If he is not granted clemency, he will be executed on December 13th .

Campaign to End the Death Penalty is sponsoring a &quot;Voices from Death Row&quot; speaking tour. It includes Tookie&apos;s friend and advocate, Barbara Becnel, and there were events in San Francisco and Berkeley on October 11th. The Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarians will be screening the movie &quot;Redemption&quot; , which is about Tookie&apos;s life, on Friday, October 21st , at 7:00 pm, at 1924 Cedar St. at Bonita Ave. in Berkeley.

 Philadelphia Oct 12 2005 The Dalai Lama Speaks at Rutgers 

 After receiving an honorary degree from the university, the Dalai Lama said he appreciated getting the honor &quot;without actually having to work hard and study.&quot;

Then the spiritual leader, dressed in red and gold monk&apos;s robes with prayer beads around his wrist, spoke to the crowd about the obsolete nature of war and ways to reach compassion and peace.

He started his &quot;Peace, War and Reconciliation&quot; lecture by saying that the topics were familiar to everybody.

&quot;I have nothing to offer, no new ideas or new views, nothing special. So, you may disappoint after listen to my ... lecture. If you feel boring, then I’m sorry. But at least today this weather--not hot, not cold, quite pleasant, so just a few minutes you spend here OK, not my problem,&quot; he said.
The crowd chuckled and applauded often as the Dalai Lama spoke against the death penalty and war and pressed for disarmament.

 Midnight, on a nice summer night. The air smells sweet and the breeze is lovely. Millions of stars twinkle in the night. Silence amidth a few street lights and no one walking around that I could see. At the turn of the street, Newton Street to be precise, cops, guns and a couple of black young men handcuffed behind their backs, picked up from their home stoop...

 Portland Oct 12 2005 Tre Arrow - Please write letters to Canada&apos;s Minister of Justice 

 Letter writing campaign to appeal U.S. extradition. 
 Hello to you all, it&apos;s Tre. I&apos;m doing well here at Wilkie. My lawyer and I have been working on the submissions to the Minister. This is an intricate part of the appeal process. What is crucial in this stage of the appeal is for you, all my supporters, to write a letter of your own to the minister of justice. I&apos;m asking as many folks as possible to do this in order to show the Canadian government, the US government, the Minister of Justice, and citizens throughout North America and the world that I have tremendous support including overwhelming opposition to my extradition to the United States. It will be harder to extradite me if there is published wide-spread outcry about the injustices and persecution I face. 
Once you have sent your letter to the minister, a copy of this letter to my lawyer Tim, and your abbreviated email version to your local newspaper&apos;s editor, please send this email to at least two other people who would be willing to do the same. We are aiming for at least 2000 letters to be sent to the minister and local newspapers.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul for your love, support, and help with this crucial part of my appeal. These letters could be the pivitol factor in achieving my freedom.

 Poor News Network describes a disturbing state-wide education policy impacting low-income youth and immigrant youth across California. According to Olivia Araiza, Program Director with Justice Matters Institute , the new high school exit exam imposes a penalty beyond anything mandated by the infamous No Child Left Behind act; it is estimated that the examination will deny diplomas to over 100,000 high school students in 2006, &quot;creating a permanent underclass ... mandated by the state.&quot; The Governator recently vetoed AB 1531 and SB 385 , which respectively would have allowed school districts to develop alternatives to the mandatory high school exit exam, and allowed students to take the exam in their first language instead of only English.

 Portland Oct 13 2005 CNN: Defending The Police State 

 
So here&apos;s that paragon of objective reporting, Aaron Brown of CNN, asking the 64 year-old Grandpa who just got the living shit beat out of him by four white cops if he was on &apos;drugs&apos;when the cops went apeshit. &apos;Of course not&apos;, came the obviously truthful reply. Brown&apos;s tack was pre-scripted. Since the event, seen globally, the media mantra has been &quot;Those poor cops, they&apos;re just overworked&quot;. Poor Grandpa, half is face is a big red scab, and Brown is asking if what the cops say is true, that he &apos;fell&apos;. Grandpa breaks out into a hearty laugh and Brown&apos;s face registers confusion. It&apos;s a Black thing, Aaron. You wouldn&apos;t understand. Then Brown brings the robotic Anderson Cooper aboard to remind us once again how stressed out the poor cops are. Did I mention the five minutes they allowed the crazy officers&apos;lawyer? He pontificated upon each blow, as CNN conveniently slowed the video clip, and calmly explained how the horrible beating you were seeing was really another thing altogether. An acceptable thing. Shades of Rodney King! Cooper&apos;s spin is that of a professional idiot who keeps asking &quot;Is this proper procedure?&quot; Of course it is, for Attilla the Hun. Cooper is also CNN&apos;s point guy on 911 coverup pieces. Debunking all &apos;911 Truth&quot; tellers is his forte&apos;. Endless mercurial analysis on these news shows will eventually dilute the impact of this affair. Cooper again- &quot;The cop is kicking him in the head twice as he lies in his own pool of blood- is this normal procedure?&quot; If Cooper can&apos;t tell, he&apos;s not even a member of the human race. &quot;It&apos;s just not the best way to deal with this&quot; he finalizes.

 Portland Oct 13 2005 No Lie Left Untried: Scaring Kids into Uniform 

 
When it comes to a reputation for selling snake oil, surely the army recruiter has long been right down there in the muck with the used car salesman and the patent medicine huckster. It&apos;s common knowledge that the promises made by recruiters about postings and future positions and training are worthless, and that once someone signs on as a recruit, her or his fate is at the whim of the military. That said, recruiters these days, desperate to fill the pipeline to Iraq&apos;s slaughterhouse with new bodies, are resorting to an interesting new spiel this days.

Word comes in from students in the Philadelphia area that recruiters at area high schools are warning them to enlist now, when they can pick the type of service they&apos;d like to do, &quot;because there&apos;s a draft coming next year and then you&apos;ll have no choice.&quot;

It&apos;s an interesting come-on because the White House and Pentagon keep saying that there are no plans for a draft. [ read more ]

 Portland Oct 13 2005 Et Tu, Tom? Another Knife in the Back for Homeless People in Portland 

 
Ever since taking office, Mayor Tom Potter has been walking a delicate and difficult line between the interests of the people of this city and the interests of those who pull the purse strings. Yesterday, alas, he stepped over onto the wrong side of that line. That&apos;s when he unveiled a plan that promises to further persecute the poor and homeless people of Portland, at the behest of the forces of gentrification.

Promising to make downtown &quot;safer,&quot; Mayor Potter expressed a desire to rid downtown of anyone who might scare shoppers away with their naked and unabashed poverty. Assuring homeless people that, hey, this is nothing personal or anything, he launched an attack on something called &quot;aggressive panhandling,&quot; as well as an assualt on &quot;a small but highly visible group who don&apos;t [sic] respect Portland&apos;s laws or its core value of respect for others.&quot; By respect for others, he appears to mean respect for those with a hearty income, rather than those who are presumably beneath our respect. Because, if anything, this proposal only reifies the already ingrained disrespect Portland&apos;s business interests show toward those who cannot afford their wares. The mayor went on to outline a 5-step program for the elimination of homeless people from our streets. Oh, that isn&apos;t what he called it or anything, but that is what it amounts to.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 13 2005 November 5th Reproductive Rights Rally and Take Back the Night March 

 The Bay Area Coalition for Our Reproductive Rights will be holding a rally for reproductive rights on Saturday, November 5th from 1pm to 4:30pm in San Francisco&apos;s Dolores Park, at 18th Street and Dolores. The event will feature speakers, entertainment, performances, information tables, and art. This event will in part be a way to raise awareness of plans to mobilize people to counter the “Walk for Life,” anti-choice fundamentalists who will be coming to San Francisco on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade on January 21st, 2006.

BACORR, one of the Bay Area’s oldest direct action reproductive rights groups, recently re-formed itself to mobilize resistance and raise awareness in response to the attacks on women’s reproductive rights and the surge in attacks on clinics in the Bay Area. BACORR’s demands include the voting down of Proposition 73 . This Parental Notification Initiative will be on the ballot in California on November 8th. It targets young women’s fundamental right to abortion and will especially impact low-income women and women of color if it is passed. Additional demands include: Supreme Court justices and laws supporting a woman’s right to control her body, expansion of civil liberties for all; the repeal of the racist Hyde Amendment , which was passed in 1976 and bans funding for abortion for women in the military or on Medicaid; universal healthcare, safe birth control, pre-natal care, and affordable childcare; defense of clinics from right-wing terrorism; ending of forced sterilization abuse of women of color; and ending the war on women at home and abroad.

BACORR is organizing during a time in which a great deal of negative pressure is being put on women&apos;s health advocates. In January 2005, 5,000 members of the anti-choice community marched in San Francisco streets, aided by the San Francisco diocese and led by two local women. They were met by thousands of defenders of a woman&apos;s right to choose. In May, Operation Rescue harassed gynecologists at the Convention of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists at the Moscone center and harassed a gynecologist in her Oakland neighborhood. In July, “The Crusade for Life” targeted Planned Parenthood in California and harassed Planned Parenthood clinics in San Francisco for a week.

Indigenous activists resisted the parade (complete with corporate floats, high school marching bands, JROTC and other military school students, police, and other icons of Eurocentric dominance) through their cultural traditions using dance and ceremony . Other activists carried out a die-in , talked with spectators, and chanted along the route.

Reactions to activists varied. Many, including onlookers and even people in floats, agreed with the protesters on their main points, some offering not to celebrate in future years. Others hurrahed genocide, swore at activists, and one protester was shoved.

 Columbus contributed to the genocide that cost the lives of 80-100 million indigenous peoples throughout the Americas. In Chicago, his holiday has been taken up by Italian-American communities as the day to celebrate their heritage, while in some countries like Venezuela they celebrate Indigenous Resistance Day instead.

After a closing ceremonial event that thanked ancestors and the Mexica Creator for the survival of culture, protesters at the parade vowed to make it an annual event, hoping to bring hundreds next year.

 Tennessee Oct 13 2005 Tenncare Forum Urges Special Session 

 Tenncare Crisis Costing Lives Nashville, TN: As the Tennesseans formerly enrolled in Tenncare enter their third month without health insurance uncounted numbers are dying due to a lack of critical life saving medication such as high blood pressure medication, insulin, anti-depressants and hiv retrovirals. These cuts, which have cost 223,000 poor and uninsurable Tennesseans their health care coverage, and which will cost another 97,000 Tennesseans their health care coverage, have prompted the call for a special session at the State Legislature, which the Governor has said he will not convene. In light of the Governor&apos;s refusal to call a special session, advocates have begun to enlist the support of State Legislators, of whom 35 have signed on thus far.

 Chicago Oct 14 2005 Venezuela Matters Expo Kicks Off in Chicago 

 [ permalink ] The Venezuela Matters Expo kicked off this morning in Chicago, giving Chicagoans an opportunity to explore a culture, history and political system whose precarious relationship with the US government has been vehemently criticized as of late by the Bush Administration as being a disruptive force in the Southern hemisphere.

But, this isn&apos;t a one-way affair -- Chicago has been making news in Venezuela lately, as well. Venezuelan White Sox manger Ozzie Guillen (who yesterday told Mayor Daley to &quot;watch out,&quot; as he might be running for mayor) received a televised phone call from President Hugo Chavez last Sunday night, saying that the nation is &quot;watching closely&quot; and rooting for the Chicago team. &quot;Now I want to win more than ever,&quot; said Ozzie, a self-proclaimed Chavez supporter.

But it is Venezuela&apos;s oil reserves that has put it on the US-media map. Two months ago, Chavez, while in New York, announced an &quot;oil-for-the-poor&quot; program , through which he plans to distribute cheap gas to low-income communities across the country, via Venezuelan CITGO stations. Chicago&apos;s Cabrini Green housing project was also selected as the pilot project for an equally ambitious plan to provide for the mass transportation of low-income African-Americans to Cuba for cataract surgery, compliments of the Venezuelan government.

All of this just weeks after Pat Robertson publicly called for the assassination of President Chavez on the &quot;700 Club.&quot; Robertson, as well as others on the right, dislikes Chavez for his outspoken disdain for President Bush and his criticisms of US policy.

Events during the next two days will highlight Venezuela&apos;s model of participatory democracy , a &quot;bottom-up&quot; way of organizing the economy and politics. The model has served to redistribute the oil wealth in the country, while significantly increasing literacy, access to health and educational services and community participation. For these reasons, the &apos;Bolivarian Revolution&apos; has instilled fear and loathing among neo-conservatives in this country , while instilling hope among poor people&apos;s movements around the world.

 Danny Glover and Jesse Jackson , two popular supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution , will be participating in the Venezuela Matters Expo in Chicago, which will feature talks, panels and performances at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition headquarters, Loyola University and at the East River Arts Center in the Loop. Comment here.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 14 2005 Timber Cutting Continues in Sequoia National Monument 

 Despite a recent federal court ruling, timber cutting continues in and near the Sequoia National Monument. On September 9th, Justice Charles Breyer from the US District Court for the northern district of California halted logging on a 2,000 acre commercial logging project called the Saddle fuel reduction sale. However, the ruling left open the fate of the Ice, White, and Frog timber sales, all of which are areas contiguous with or in the immediate proximity of the Saddle project. The focus of Breyer’s ruling was the absence of credible scientific evidence in the Forest Service’s guidelines for these timber sales. Of particular concern was the critical condition of the Pacific fisher population in the southern Sierras. Further decrease in canopy cover and disruption of fisher habitat could likely bring about the extinction of the species (the Bush administration has refused to accept the recommendation of scientists for listing the southern fisher as an endangered species). Sierra Nevada Earth First! activists were in the woods again this past weekend surveying timber sale units in the Frog, White, and Ice sale areas.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 14 2005 Palestinian Elections and In-Fighting 

 Palestinian parliamentary elections are scheduled for January 26th, 2006 . There are increasing signs that the elections will not be held on schedule . &quot;If the election is put off yet again (the latest postponement was this past July), the current council, elected nearly 10 years ago, will continue to serve. It fails to reflect the considerable political changes that have taken place since then.&quot;
 Hamas has backed hundreds of candidates in the ongoing municipal elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and has taken nearly a third of the seats. They will likely increase their number of seats in the upcoming elections. &quot;[T]he participation or otherwise of Hamas in Palestinian legislative elections presents Abbas and the PA with a real dilemma. On the one hand, the exclusion of Hamas would eviscerate the elections of credibility and democratic substance. Palestinians would view the poll as a big joke. On the other hand, Hamas&apos;s participation could result in victory for Islamic candidates and drastically change the Palestinian political panorama .&quot; Sharon has warned that Israel will prevent the organisation of the January elections if the PA failed to disarm Hamas and get it to &quot;abandon its anti-Zionist ideology&quot;. &quot;We will make every effort not to help the Palestinians. I don&apos;t think they can have elections without our help,&quot; Sharon was quoted as telling reporters.

For the first time since the start of the intifada, more Palestinians have been killed in internal violence since the start of the year than those who have died in clashes with Israel, according to an official report published Thursday. The Israel Defense Forces has advised the government to release additional Palestinian prisoners , in an effort to strengthen Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas.

 With Israel constantly narrowing the horizons with roadblocks, mass arrests and separation walls, Palestinians this week were closer than ever to a point of implosion. In Gaza, a fortnight of accumulating tension between the PA and Hamas culminated in street clashes between the two sides, resulting in the deaths of three people. Both Hamas and the PA gave contradictory accounts of the Sunday night incident. Hamas accused PA police of having beaten Muhammed Rantisi, son of the late Hamas leader Abdul-Aziz Rantisi who was murdered by Israel over two years ago. The PA had an entirely different version. Interior Ministry spokesman Tawfik Abu Khusa said a routine patrol tried to resolve a scuffle between two citizens at an ATM machine. One of the two was Rantisi, who, the PA statement said, called upon Hamas supporters and fighters to come to his aid.

 Portland Oct 14 2005 From an Iraq War Vet in Portland.... 

 There are times that I wish that I could wish everything away. Other times, I want to stand naked in front of the entire nation to force them to see what they&apos;ve done to me. I want people to know what war really is.

My skin is broken out right now. There&apos;s this rash that crops up
occasionally. Two years ago was the worst. The dermatologist said that I had three different types of rashes covering more than 90% of my body. Nothing ever makes this go away but time. Ice will reduce the swelling. Caladryl will help, so will this prescription hormone ointment, but nothing makes it go away until it is ready to go.

For the past few months, I&apos;ve been getting boils and blisters on my feet. This week, the current iteration of this, is a weepy rash of blisters in the crook of my left elbow. Sure, this is annoying and embarassing, but that&apos;s not the worst of it. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 For three decades public access TV has provided thousands of communities around the nation with a place where ordinary people can make and air media that matters to them. It’s estimated that over 1.2 million people volunteer on a regular basis at public access TV stations. They make programming on every imaginable subject, from cultural issues to self-help programming for immigrants. From targeted programming for youth, for seniors, for women, for the disabled, to faith based programs and televised psychics.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 15 2005 Military Off UCSC - March&amp;Rally Tuesday! 

 Bring 5 friends and show up at 10am, Baytree Plaza 

On Tuesday, multiple branches of the u.s. military will be recruiting at UCSC for the first time this year. In April - the last time the military was here - recruiters were kicked off campus by hundreds of students. On Tuesday, students will be holding a large march and rally to re-affirm that UCSC is a campus opposed to discrimination, opposed to war, and opposed to recruiters&apos; lies.

While our Career Center requires that all groups coming to our job fairs affirm that they are Equal Opportunity Employers, the military is the ONLY institution that is granted an exception. Through the military&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&quot; policy, queers are officially banned from any position. This is in addition to the military&apos;s official ban on women serving combat positions.

The rally for Fouad Kaady is at hand, and I am making another public call for support from our community. The rally will begin at 2p.m in front of the Subway located in downtown Sandy off of Proctor Blvd. We have flyers and large posters ready for all those that want to help inform the citizens there of what has transpired to our much beloved Fouad. It is very difficult for us (his immediate family) to go back to the city whose police officers murdered our precious son and brother, so we need all of our friends, family, and concerned citizens to be there. Standing united we are a much stronger power which is beyond the lethal force these lost souls used against the light that Fouad was and still is to us all. May he be glorified and remembered for who he really was. A grand soul with a grand purpose which was to love unconditionally and to feed all who crossed his path with a precious smile, sincere word, or to share his blessed bread. [ read more ] 

Support is needed for Grand Jury Trials

The grand jury trial for Fouad Kaady who was shot and murdered by the Sandy and Clackamas Police Departments a little over a month ago will be this Monday and Tuesday October 17th and 18th. The jury will convene at 10:45 a.m on Monday and at 8:30 a.m on Tuesday and will be meeting at the Clackamas County Courthouse located at 807 Main Street in Oregon City. We are need of as many individuals to come and show our power in numbers. We need to show the people responsible in attaining justice that we loved Fouad and we expect those that perpetuated this heinous crime to be held accountable. We have ten posters with Fouad&apos;s picture and a few words about what happened to him that need to be held by his friends, family, and citizens. The ruthless killing of our beloved bretheren needs to stop! Fouad could have easily been your son, brother, nephew, cousin, or much beloved friend. The time is at hand to make a change. Please come out and stand in unity with us. [ read more ]

 Portland Oct 15 2005 Channel 1&quot;news&quot;now playing at a school near you 

 
If theres an ad you dont want to see or hear, you can just turn down the radio or turn off the TV, right? Wrong. Now, at schools around the country, a company known as Channel 1 has somehow been given the right to play a 12 minuite &quot;news&quot; broadcast every day at my school. Each day, I go to my 4th period class known as &quot;study time&quot; or &quot;sustained silent reading&quot;, sit down, take out a book, and read for 20 minuites. Then, when that 20 minuites is up, the TV in our class turn on automaticly, and begins an annoyingly loud &quot;news&quot; broadcast. Everyone but me and the others who care for their minds put their books away and stare blankly at the flashing box before us.I once asked one of the girls that watches it &quot;How can you stand this?&quot; and she said &quot;Well its better than reading...&quot;. Some sustained silent reading! Anyway, after that goes on for 5 minuites, 1 minuite of ad comes on. These include ads for make-up, video games, and the U.S. Navy. Thats right, the Navy. Mind you, they dont just cone out and say &quot;Join the Navy,&quot; they have a picture of some show that will be on tha night, with a box up in the corner &quot;Presented by: US Navy,&quot; so as to create a subliminal message that the Navy (or sometimes the Army) is the right choise. I asked my teacher why the heck we had to watch this crap, and he told me the school gets these free TVs for every class if we watch their show every day. [ read more ]

 San Diego Oct 15 2005 SDSU Activists Protest Military Recruiters 

 The Campus Anti-war Network at San Diego State protested military recruiters on October 13th and refused to back down in the face of police intimidation.

Military recruiters occupied San Diego State University for three days this week. They put on an extravagant display with hummers, war simulation games, a rock climbing wall, and even propelled off of buildings and parachuted out of aircrafts. All of this was an attempt to project an image of the military as a hub of adventure and excitement. Our protest showed up to expose the reality of life in the military: war, discrimination, sexual harassment and unfulfilled promises of opportunity. 10 activists from the Campus Anti-war Network (CAN) and the International Socialist Organization surrounded the recruiters during one of their propelling stunts and demanded that the military leave our campus.

 New Orleans Oct 17 2005 Points for Visiting Activists to Consider 

 As residents of New Orleans, we offer a few suggestions for people who have come to help us rebuild our city on how you can better stand behind the concept “Solidarity not Charity.” First, we must say that we are very glad that people are here helping, and we are glad that your skills, labor, and resources are being offered to communities that have needed them for a long time. We are not making these suggestions to make you feel uncomfortable or unappreciated, but to help you put your skills and resources to use in ways that are most helpful and least alienating. It is crucial at this point for returning New Orleanians to feel like they are coming home to the city they left, not to a strange place filled with well meaning, but unfamiliar people who don’t know our culture or our city.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 17 2005 Victory Party Held to Celebrate&quot;Not Guilty&quot;Verdict for Juanita Young 

 Juanita Young was found not guilty last month in Bronx Supreme Court by Judge P. Benitez after a four day trial that took place more than two years after the initial incident in question. Young is a well known and outspoken anti-police brutality activist who first came into the political spotlight after the police killing of her son, Malcolm Ferguson, in March 2000 in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Juanita has since been a member of the October 22nd Coalition to Stop Police Brutality and of the Justice Committee of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights.

In June of 2003, Juanita Young and her family were illegally evicted, and she and her children were left homeless for three months. At the time of her arrest, NYPD cop Hernandez told her, &quot;No rallies for you today.&quot; Young was also manhandled and brutalized in the course of her illegal eviction and arrest and continues to suffer from those injuries sustained on that day over two years ago. In September of 2005, Judge Benitez declared that Juanita Young was not trespassing when she was arrested in her own home on the morning of June 7, 2003, in the eviction that had been engineered by her landlord and carried out by the NYPD. Members of the October 22nd Coalition to Stop Police Brutality had long held that the illegal eviction of Juanita Young was politically motivated one, and that it was directed at silencing dissent in the post-911 political climate. Juanita Young was represented by Geoffrey Stewart of the Stewart Law Offices. A victory dinner and legal fundraiser for Lynne Stewart and Geoff Stewart were held in New York on October 16th.

 Portland Oct 17 2005 Vigil When 2,000 Deaths are Announced 

 Candlelight Vigil when the Oregonian announces 2000 Americans have died in Iraq At 7:00 pm on the day they announce 2000 American deaths, line the railings along Waterfront Park and the Esplanade between Hawthorne and Morrison Bridges.

Bring a candle, and join us in vigil to bear witness for all who have died in this war. No leaders, no chants, just candlelight across the river bearing witness. Westside will be at Waterfront Park, east side along the Esplanade.

There might be 25 of us, or 250, or 2500. Our number isn&apos;t the point. The horrendous numbers of deaths is the point, and our moral opposition to this war is why we will be there.

 Portland Oct 17 2005 Million More Movement Rally Strikes Unity Theme 

 No wonder the ADL&apos;s mouthpiece, Abe Foxman, tried to discourage leaders of the African-American community from attending the &quot;Million More Movement&quot; rally, which was held on Saturday, Oct. 15, 2005, on the Nation&apos;s Mall. The event, from its inception, sounded a positive theme of unity. A theme like that tends to drives hypocrites like Foxman, right up the proverbial wall. The unity theme was also evident in the signs, posters and banners seen during the affair, on a very sunny and warm day.

As far as the eye could see, the historic Mall-a space which by tradition belongs to the people-was filled with participants, the vast majority of them black. They stretched from the Washington Monument to the base of the west side of Capitol Hill, where the main stage was established. (Capitol Hill, a/k/a &quot;Traitors&apos; Hill,&quot; is where members of the U.S. Congress, like U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD), continue to vote to fund the unjust, Neocon-inspired Iraqi War to the tune of $7 billion a month). The support in the Black community for President George W. Bush is now at 2 percent, while his overall approval rating is at an all time low of 39 percent, and falling.

The Million More Movement (MMM) was a reprise of the highly successful &quot;Million Man March&quot; rally held ten years ago in this city by a coalition of African-American groups. Today&apos;s effort had an even broader base of organizational support. It called for economic and social justice for &quot;the poor and disenfranchised&quot; and for mobilizing individuals into a process to transform American society and to finally &quot;eliminate poverty and injustice.&quot; Part of the program for the rally was set aside to hear the &quot;Voices of Peace,&quot; regarding the immoral and illegal war in Iraq.

 Richmond Oct 17 2005 10/9 Sacred Ground: Stories of Resistance and Rebellion 

 The Richmond Defenders for Freedom, Justice, and Equality held their 3rd Annual Commemoration of Gabriel&apos;s Rebellion and Sacred Ground on October 8-9, 2005. Last year, the Defenders unveiled the only public memorial in Richmond to the slave organizer/insurrectionist Gabriel at 15th and Broad streets. The events are in part a commemoration of the 205th anniversary of the execution of Gabriel in Shockoe Bottom after his plan of a slave rebellion was discovered. Gabriel is celebrated for his intense desire for freedom, his broad and inclusive sense of justice, and his great skill in organizing hundreds to fight for liberation. He was 24 years old when executed by Virginia in 1800. The events this year focused on Sacred Ground and the campaign to stop the proposed stadium construction in Richmond’s Shockoe Bottom. Shockoe Bottom was once an east coast epicenter for the slave trade. Rivaled only by New Orleans and Natchez, Miss., Shockoe Bottom played a central role in with buying and selling of Africans into slavery for generations. There is a proposal to build a baseball stadium and “Market Village” in this area. The Defenders and others are fighting to turn the same area into a public remembrance of the function Shockoe Bottom played in the slavery system.

 Chicago Oct 17 2005 Anti-immigrant Conference Faced Protest, Blockade, Arrests 

 [ permalink ] Dozens , and then hundreds [ 1 | 2 | 3 ], of Chicago-area community members delayed, in dramatic fashion, a national anti-immigrant organization &apos;s meeting in Chicago&apos;s Arlington Heights suburb on the morning of October 15, 2005. Activists linked their bodies arm in arm to form a human chain at the gates of the school where a meeting of the Minuteman Project was slated to take place.

The protest, at the gates of the Christian Liberty Academy on Euclid Avenue , saw some 15 to 25 activists (at their height) form a human blockade three lines thick at the entrance to the conference . The number of protesters had significantly outnumbered Arlington Heights police , who called for additional backup from at least five other nearby suburbs.

The stakes increased dramatically around noon when some 400 anti-Minuteman-protesters from assorted communities in Chicago arrived via bus convoy. The barricade then dispersed to join the rally, with the intent to reconvene later that afternoon.

Soon after, a team of police officers physically isolated an activist who had stood on the front line of the barricade. Protesters surrounded the police and the attempted arrest and tried to pull the activist out of custody. At that point, more police arrived to enter the fray, leading to more activist arrests.

The day ended abruptly around 1:40 PM when a bus load of riot police arrived to disperse the crowd.

Those arrested could be counted among the most outspoken activists, those targeted as &quot;leaders&quot; and &quot;agitators&quot; of the morning&apos;s barricade. All the arrestees were later released that evening. Comment here.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 18 2005 12th Annual Peace and Unity March in Watsonville 

 Hundreds gathered in Watsonville, CA on Sunday, Oct. 16 to march for peace and commemorate the victims of violence.

The annual Peace&amp;Unity March began after the brutal murder of Jorge (16) and his little sister Jessica (9) Cortez. Jorge and Jessica were gunned down execution style outside a panaderia in Pajaro one February evening. A few months later, Tony Valdivia (19) was shot to death in a local beach party. Local youth were outraged and decided to do something about it. This march conmemorates all carnales and carnalas who have died of gang, domestic, and international violence in our community.

For 11 consecutive years the Brown Berets have brought the different barrios together in a march which encompasses Watsonville as a whole. We are not only advocating for peace, but also for unity within our barrios.

 Portland Oct 18 2005 Report back from 10/15/05 Fouad Kaady demonstration in Sandy, Oregon 

 
At Sandy, Oregon on this 15th day of October, at 2pm, in the parking lot bounded by the library, subway sandwich shop, and the police station, about 35 people gathered to raise the awareness of the public regarding the fate of 27 year old Fouad Kaady, brought to his death September 8th of this year by the guns of a Sandy policeman, mid-20&apos;s and a Clackamas County Sheriff, mid-40&apos;s.

Bright overcast skies with breaks of sun and temperature in the 60&apos;s had people introducing themselves to each other, consulting about how signs they were making should read, and choosing locations on either side of the island, created by swift moving multi-lane traffic of highway 26, east bound traffic on the south, and west bound traffic to the north, upon which central downtown Sandy sits.

People held up about 10 nice big signs with the text &quot;Unlawful Death in sandy, oregon by the Police&quot;, lots of smaller ones, and a couple large size photos of Fouad, one poster size in a very egaging depiction of his natural youth and vigor.

At first, to considerable degree, people driving by seemed to register blank faces of incomprehension, not too much horn tooting in recognition. Maybe it was just that demonstrators hadn&apos;t yet polished their manner of relating to the public passing by. After about an hour, hour and a half, things started snappin&apos; and many, many motorists attention was drawn to the text of handmade signs such as &quot;Release toxicology reports...It&apos;s the law&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t shoot me, I&apos;m dressed&quot; and simply, &quot;Don&apos;t shoot. Amen&quot;, juxtoposed against the large poster picture and the 10 big signs. [ read more ]

 As Phil Sanford of the Portland Tribune regularly has done in his column, The Oregonian associate editor David Reinhard, noted for the conservative tenor of his views expressed there, takes jabs at the City Campaign Finance Fund for it&apos;s intent to make public funds available without sufficient control to would be candidates for city commissioner or auditor.

According to those guys, all you got to do is have I.D., and get 1000 of your supporters to contribute $5 each. It&apos;s slightly more complicated than that, but do-able. Refer to the following web address for details: http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=38751 

Meeting the qualifying requirements entitles candidates to be &quot;eligible to receive an initial primary election allocation of $150,000 for their campaign&quot;. You&apos;d have to read all the info and finelines (and believe me, there&apos;s a lot of them) on the website or in the packet candidates can pick up, but according to Reinhard, you can spend it on a fancy schmancy campaign office and the trimmings if you want. So far, only 6 people have signed up to participate in the Campaign Finance Fund program. Time is wasting. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 Portland Oct 18 2005 Kaady Grand Jury Day 

 
We spent the morning standing outside of the Clackamas County Courthouse. We got to the courthouse at 10 o&apos;clock and stood with pictures of Fouad as people milled around going about their daily business. Once in awhile someone would stop to ask what we were doing there, and we spent time explaining the circumstances of Fouad&apos;s death. Channel 6 news was also there and a reporter fron NPR came later. Just as the Kaady family began to arrive, Channel 8 news also joined the group. A man carrying a flag which read &quot;Justice&quot;, who was also at the demonstration in Sandy on Saturday stood on the corner across from the court house. I was a little sorry that so few of us who were not of the Kaady family showed up. Fouad&apos;s sisters do wonderful jobs of speaking for the family so we faded into the background as they arrived and came on home. I am attaching one picture of the event. [ read more ] 

Fouad Kaady&apos;s Killer back at work before the Grand Jury even hears testimony

Officer Bergin of the Sandy Police Department has been back to work for a week now, according to the Gresham Outlook. He has been doing &quot;desk duty&quot; doing paperwork and reviewing background checks for potential reserve officers. Therefore, it looks like they already thought they knew the outcome of a Grand Jury before they even met to decide whether an indictment is handed down. Of course, this was before they knew that Fouad Kaady was Zaki&apos;s cousin. How could an officer be checking background information for potential officers when he has been charged with a most serious crime? How do people in Sandy live under these people? WOW! It really amazes me. We found three more witnesses Saturday in Sandy, eyewitnesses who have not been called. [ read more ]

When police tried to escort the nazis out in the neighborhood they were pelted by rocks and a crowd of up to 600 residents gathered in protest. Tear gas was used to push back people but the police were unable to control the crowd as they were hit by rocks when they would try to advance. Eventually a small bar is burnt down and several fire trucks pelted by rocks and a state of emergency is declared for the city and an 8pm curfew set.

 Portland Oct 19 2005 Statement by former political prisoner Antonio Camacho Negrón 

 The FBI has issued an arrest warrant for former Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Antonio Camacho Negr?n, arrested for being a part of the MACHETEROS in the late 1980s. Following is a statement that Antonio Camacho Negr?n wrote and asked that ProLibertad read at the Oct. 14th picket in New York City:
&quot;I feel that the FBI will make an attempt on my life and justify it with fabricated lies in pursuit of the information I have shared with various elements of the Puerto Rican media, as well as to quell the revolutionary spirit that has been activated by Filiberto&apos;s death. The FBI will resort to acts of terrorism against me and others who are calling for a full investigation of Filiberto&apos;s death to terrify and silence the people from demanding the truth.

Earlier this week, there were allegations by provocateur elements in Puerto Rico who have made bold attempts to smear the name and reputation of Filiberto&apos;s wife. I believe that the smear tactics are a strategic ploy by the federal government to ruin her credibility as a witness to events that led to her husband&apos;s assassination.&quot;

But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of areas that will likely be targeted for industrial wreckreation development in much the way that Mt. St. Helens was targeted.

 Binghamton Oct 19 2005 BU Attempted Rape: Should Matt Chayes/Pipedream Share Responsibility? 

 As reported by Binghamton Indymedia in April , the Binghamton University newspaper, the Pipe Dream, published a satirical issue called the Pipe Bomb, which featured several articles which made violence towards women seem normal and humorous, including a photo of a white male performing a simulated coat-hanger abortion on a black female, and a front page feature with a photograph of a simulated rape.
On Saturday, a BU student was charged with attempted rape . Does Matt Chayes, the Pipe Dream managing editor responsible for the issue, share some of the blame?

 Boston Oct 19 2005 Anti-war movement wins Peterson&apos;s reinstatement; Tariq Khan still facing charges 

 After being &apos;banned&apos; from campus, Charles Peterson, as of Oct. 8, has been reinstated at Holyoke Community College. This victory for the entire counter-recruitment and anti-war movement came only after massive worldwide support for Peterson and resistance actions including a march and rally on campus Oct. 6. But the counter-recruitment movement is still being attacked relentlessly by the Pentagon and college administrations as the case of Peterson and Tariq Khan demonstrates.

 Portland Oct 19 2005 COCA COLA up to their usual tricks in Guatemala 

 They didn&apos;t even know their father&apos;s crime until the armed men told them: &quot;We are going to get that son of a bitch for trade unionism and he is going to die.&quot; 
On a sunny afternoon in Guatemala City a number of weeks ago armed men entered the house of Jose Armando Palacios. On finding he was not at home, they tied up his nine-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. Holding a gun to the children&apos;s heads, they demanded to know the whereabouts of their father. The children did not know.

Jose Armando is a member of Sitinca, a joint trade union of workers of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in the south of Guatemala and of a coffee producer called Incasa. Despite the signing of peace accords in 1996, which brought an end to the country&apos;s 36-year civil war in which thousands of social activists were &quot;disappeared&quot; and many more were forced into exile, little has changed for the trade union movement. According to some, the situation has worsened.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 19 2005 Rally, Queer Kiss-in Greet Military Recruiters at UCSC 

 On October 18th, hundreds of students marched and rallied at UC Santa Cruz to protest the presence of military recruiters at the campus career fair.

A Queer Kiss-in was staged in front of recruiters&apos; tables during the march and rally. From inside the fair, kissers were able to effectively block access to military recruiters without shutting down the entire career fair.

The military&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell&quot; hiring practices are in violation of the UC system&apos;s non-discrimination policy. Protesters demanded that the UC adhere to its own policies by protecting all students from discrimination and securing UCSC as a hate-free zone.

 Currently, the Solomon Amendment states that any university which denies military recruiters &quot;equal access&quot; to students will lose federal funding. The Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (FAIR) is challenging the constitutionality of the Solomon amendment in a Supreme Court case, FAIR v Rumsfeld, which will be heard in December. Protesters on Tuesday urged the University of California to become the thirty-ninth school in the country to join FAIR.

 Still We Ride and the Santa Cruz Bicycle Film Festival 

A special GDI event THIS Friday. We have the honor of co-hosting the Santa Cruz Bicycle Film Festival with People Power . The lack of easy and convenient public transportation this month is sending you a clear message: Get on your bike. Become part of bike culture and join us for this special event.

The Santa Cruz Bicycle Film Festival will show several bicycling films, including animated shorts, documentaries on bike messenger culture, and short films about the simple joy of riding a bike. The featured film, Still We Ride , is a newly-released documentary about Critical Mass, from its formation in San Francisco over 10 years ago to the mass arrests of cyclists in New York in August 2004. Currently the film is on a international tour to bring awareness to the New York Critical Mass cause.

PLUS thrilling and funny short films, an intermission, great company, and a rollicking bike ride after the movie.

 Madison Oct 19 2005 Former High School Senior Sentenced to Prison for Having Sex with Freshman: Punishment to Fit the Crime or Railroaded Through the System? 

 A Dane County judge recently sent former Madison LaFollete High School student Eric Dixon to prison for having sex with a girl when he was a senior in high school and she was a freshman. Although the act was consensual, he was convicted of second degree sexual assault because she was under the age of 16 years at the time and he did not contest the charge. Following his conviction, the judge ordered him to serve 40 days in jail, register as a sex offender in the state of Wisconsin, and he was placed on 4 years probation. His sentence was suspended, provided he stayed on probation. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections revoked his probation on July 28, 2005, and on September 2, 2005, the judge sentenced him to 2 and 1/2 years to 6 and 1/2 years in prison. The earliest date for his release is March 2007; the latest March 2011. Eric&apos;s mother claims he was railroaded by the system. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 20 2005 U&apos;wa Reject New Drilling Plans 

 
 17 October 2005: The U&apos;wa people of northeast Colombia have again rejected the extraction of oil from their cloudforest home and refused to participate further in a &quot;Prior Consultation&quot; process to legitimize the process. The project in question is the Siriri oil block, abandoned by California multinational Occidental Petroleum under sustained pressure from the U&apos;wa, campesinos and international supporters. The block is now being explored by the Colombian state firm Ecopetrol, with the assistance of Spanish multinational Repsol. When government representatives helicoptered in to U&apos;wa territory on September 28, they were met by a clear rejection from the U&apos;wa traditional government, which vowed never to allow oil drilling.

As part of a speaking tour across the United States, two representatives of the U&apos;wa people visited the Bay Area October 10-16 to speak out against renewed oil drilling attempts in their territory. U&apos;wa international representative and community organizer Daris Cristancho expressed her communities defiance against government threats to cut off social spending if the U&apos;was do not permit drilling: &quot;The laws of the U&apos;wa do not change as the laws of the government do... We would rather live dignified lives deep in the mountains than be bribed [in exchange for drilling].&quot;

 Portland Oct 20 2005 Peaceful Vigils Continue in Support of Justice for Fouad Kaady 

 
 Kaady Grand Jury second day: People began arriving at the Clackamas County court house shortly after 8 a.m. and gathered their signs and flyers to begin a second day of informing the public about what happened to Fouad Kaady on September 8, 2005. There are still many people in the community who are shocked to hear about what had happened to him. Today there were about 40 people standing on the corners of downtown Oregon City. Many of them were members of the Kaady family. I cannot say enough about how strong and caring this family is. They talked about how generous and full of life Fouad was, how he loved growing food in his garden and what a fabulous cook he was. There was so much love for him expressed that even though I had never met him, I came away with the knowledge that a wonderful young man was killed in a tragic way and that his family will always carry him in their hearts. [ read more ] 

 Pass The Collection Plate For Oregon City: I attended the protest at Clackamas County Courthouse today again, where parking tickets were flying more numerous than leaves, because little Oregon City likes money so much more than people. I parked blocks away on the river side of McLoughlin in a free two-hour zone, because i had not enuf change for a meter, which gives only a half hour for each quarter. Just one other car was parked where i was, so spaces were obviously not in demand. When i went back to my car i had a ticket. It said that my tire was chalked at 9:15&amp;the ticket issued at 11:17. So the meter person was literally waiting to give me a ticket! Oregon City is THAT desperate for revenue. [ read more ] 

 Kaady Grand Jury Day 3: We got to the court house at 11 a.m., joining some of the Kaady family in another day of passing out fliers and generally keeping Fouad Kaady&apos;s name and story before the public. There were only 12 to 15 people there today, most of them members of the Kaady family, but many citizens continued to stop and ask about what had happened to Fouad. A woman stopped her car, got out, and hugged two of the Kaady family saying, &quot;I lost my daughter three years ago, and my heart is with you.&quot; Someone else made small angels for the family. One gentleman gave the group a potted plant, the red flowers a bright spot to the day. Mrs. Kaady, always mindful of the needs of others, gave the plant out to people who had been helping her and it finally went to the office of Executive Copy Printing, a local business which had been printing fliers for us as we ran out, at no cost. [ read more ] 

 Might be last day, pray for justice: The grand jury may be releasing their verdict Thursday October 20th whether or not to indite the two bastard officers that killed Fouad Kaady. The support is crucial at this time and we need to show the police and county that we care and need justice...for all. The jury meets around ten a.m., but any time you can make it would be powerful. If they do not indite these officers for killing a naked, injured man then that will be clearly showing us, the people, that NOTHING will ever prove that these cowards are guilty. Do not let this slide under your nose without doing what you can, use your word, use your presence and stand up for our rights, safety and justice. The Kaady family needs you to stand strong with them, and for all others who have lost someone this way or WILL lose someone this way if we don&apos;t speak out now. OREGON CITY COURTHOUSE 8th and Main. [ read more ]

 Presentation of the Artist- Nelson Santana and the Work Group La Piedrita The landslide victory of president Hugo Chavez Frias in December of 1998 spawned and consolidated a host of national and international movements in solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. The Venezuelan people, after five decades of struggle against oligarchic and neoliberal governments, finally took the reins of their own destiny; the world celebrated this democratic victory. The movements in solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution have been key in communicating the ideology, victories and battles, of the Venezuelan government - a government founded on a constitution that establishes a participatory democracy, in which people are protagonists. This informational effort has been particularly important in view of the aggressive media, economic and military campaign, waged by national and global capitalist elites against the Bolivarian Revolution. The labor of solidarity movements is thus commendable, and the continuation of their support for a Latin American project of social justice, necessary.

 Houston Oct 21 2005 Pakistan /= Palistine 

 From the Newswire: Though we live Houston, there is apparently no Pakistani Indymedia Network, so I feel obliged to fill in some space. The number of people in Houston, who are unaware of the existence of Pakistan seems to be escalating at an alarming rate, or is simply saturated!!! Experts agree unanimously that this trend must be reversed before an impending terrorist attack on the “stupid yankees.”

They also blame many factors, such as television, for what is now officially a “pandemic of ignorance.” Of course, they said something like that about what would happen if a hurricane hits New Orleans, and apparently America voluntarily allowed the worst possible scenario to simply play out, before rescue teams realized that poverty could keep victims from rescuing themselves.

One individual, who shall remain unnamed, when asked if he’d heard of the recent earthquake, retorted, “well that’s what they get for terrorizing the Israelis.”

When asked to elaborate, it became clear that this person was confusing Pakistan with Palestine, a country which still does not exist. This person also believes that this conflict has been going on since the beginning of time, and will therefore never end. This apparently is a growing trend in the anti-Islamic and Arab-phobic post 1984 America.

 New Orleans Oct 21 2005 STOP THE ILLEGAL REMOVAL OF PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS FROM NEW ORLEANS 

 As public housing residents and supporters in the New Orleans area, we demand that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) and landlords stop using alleged hurricane damage to public housing projects as a pretext for cutting off section 8 payments to its residents. Our association knows full well that the agencies in charge of these housing complexes are using allegations of storm damage to the complexes as a pretext for expelling working class African-Americans, in a very blatant attempt to coopt our homes and sell them to developers to build high-priced housing. In this way, they are taking HUD secretary Alfonso Jackson&apos;s statement that this disaster will result in a &quot;whiter New Orleans&quot; and turning it into a reality, and we say no to this ethnic cleansing.

 New Hampshire Oct 21 2005 NH to Protest After 2000th US death in Iraq 

 Dear friends, As of today, 1978 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq. Uncounted thousands of Iraqis--over 100,000 civilians, by some estimates--have died since the U.S. invasion in 2003. ON THE DAY AFTER THE 2,000th U.S. military death in Iraq is announced, people will gather in communities across the U.S. to say that the country&apos;s pro-peace majority wants Congress to stop the killing by stopping the funding of the war. (If current trends continue, the 2000th U.S. death will occur in late October or early November.) Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 Portland Oct 22 2005 We Will Not Be Broken! Thousands walk off the job in support of striking teachers 

 Despite government threats, thousands walked off the job in support of striking teachers on Monday. Businesses were up in arms at the refusal of BC workers to adhere to the law. &quot;People must obey the law&quot;, Jerry Lampert from the Business Council of British Columbia warned, &quot;or we are on the short or long road to anarchy in this province, and we just can&apos;t afford that&quot;. Lampert&apos;s comments, cited by speakers at the rally, provoked the laughter of thousands of striking teachers and their supporters. When faced with the gross disavowal of worker&apos;s rights, thousands have shown that the law is illegitimate not the strike.

 Portland Oct 22 2005 From Camp Casey to D.C. 

 Bette Lee is a longtime activist photographer. When Cindy Sheehan set up Camp Casey outside George Bush&apos;s ranch in Crawford, Texas, Lee decided to take a trip down there to see things for herself and to support the anti-war direct action that Cindy Sheehan started. Inspired by what she saw, she then followed the story to the giant antiwar demonstration of September 24th in Washington, D.C. She will be giving a reportback on what she witnessed and show us what she caught on film. The presentation will be followed by a discussion about the anti-war/peace movement: what issues need to be addressed, what its goals are, what will happen after the war ends or the troops are brought home?

Please join Bette Lee and the IWW this Saturday night, October 22nd, at 7pm at the IWW Hall at 616 E. Burnside for an interesting and informative presentation with plenty of discussion afterwards. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt; 

 Portland Oct 22 2005 Mike D - In Trouble While In Trouble 

 Just returned from my allotted 30 minute visit with Mike D. He seems to be doing okay despite the fact he is facing possibly 20 days in the hole for the offense of refusing to strip down during the clothing exchange and wrap himself in a blanket. Does anyone have any firsthand knowledge of this practice? He is only allowed out of his cell for 30 minutes a day but can still receive mail and two half hour visits per week with up to 3 visitors per session. I put some money on his account so he could buy stamps and envelopes to reply to those who write him. Please - if you cannot go out and visit him then send your support through letters - read the list of rules/regulations for sending mail that was posted earlier.

 We are looking for anyone who was present at the circus protest that witnessed his arrest - especially if you have photos or video tape of the incident. If you can provide any info please contact me at 503 775-5777 or get in touch with his court appointed attorney - Alan Norris. It has also been requested that letters be sent to the Sheriffs Department/Bernie Guisto - probably not the correct spelling - Mayor Tom Potter and both the City and County Commissioners to express your outrage that our tax dollars are being wasted on housing Mike D - a peaceful protester and activist - on these bogus charges while other more dangerous inmates are being released due to a &quot;lack of jail beds.&quot; [ Read More ] Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 22 2005 Santa Cruz Bus Drivers on Strike, Students in Solidarity 

 On September 8th United Transportation Union (UTU) Local 23 signed a state-mediated agreement with the Santa Cruz Transit District’s negotiating team to ensure there was no disruption in service to the Metro’s 23,000 customers. The drivers, knowing that a strike would mean working-class members of the community as well as students would be without transportation, decided to work under the Metro Board’s rules until June 30, 2006, allowing plenty of time to work out negotiations over a new contract. The deal was no strike, no lockout.

On September 23rd UTU members were shocked to hear that the Metro Board had voted to renege on their side of the agreement and that all worker protections had been removed. The state-mediator said that in all of his years overseeing contact negotiations, he had never seen a public sector employer turn down a state-mediated agreement. Under these conditions, the drivers were forced to call an indefinite strike on September 26.

This is an unfair labor practices strike and is not about wages. It’s about dignity and respect. The drivers are not asking for a raise, they simply want to keep what they have. They want to keep their benefits, which were immediately revoked when the Metro Board threw out the no-strike agreement. One main issue on the table is a system of general leave, where senior drivers would be permitted to take a month-long unpaid vacation once a year that would actually save the district money. The Board refuses to budge.

 Portland Oct 22 2005 Kaady Grand Jury Day Five 

 We arrived at the Clackamas County court house at 9 this morning. Family and friends brought the signs and fliers for what we hoped would be the last day of this peaceful vigil. Twenty people were there most of the day, but from time to time the group grew a bit larger when people who heard the story of Fouad Kaady decided to stand with us. That was always welcome. A deputy stopped his car in the street, and accepted a flier from one of us... This is a long and tiring process and each person alone might get discouraged, but we draw on our combined strengths and help each other stand for this young man, Fouad Kaady, who deserves justice.

 A letter from Fouad Kaady&apos;s neighbor and friend. I lost my friend. I stand on the up-ended cinderblock, peering over my neighbor&apos;s fence. Still in dis-belief, I search for Fouad, out tending his garden, hoping to see his handsome young face with the engaging smile, and lively dark brown eyes. I listen keenly for his friendly hello. Nothing. I see his cat, Tiger, and the silence is suddenly broken by his soft meow, calling for a master who grew a catnip plant just for him! My eyes fill with tears, at the stark reality, my friend is gone. [ Read More ] Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 22 2005 Need for Solidarity with Anti-Racist Protesters from Toledo, Ohio 

 On October 15th, 2005 , the National Socialist Movement (NSM) attempted to hold a picket and march in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in the North End of Toledo, Ohio. The neo-Nazi rally was protested by hundreds of neighborhood residents who were joined by members of the Anti-Racist Action Network from across the United States and Canada. Approximately 114 local people were arrested in a police riot that followed the cancellation of the neo-Nazi march. They are being charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies. A week later, at least a dozen people are still being held in Toledo jails. Judges have refused to reduce bail or offer bond, so these 12 adults continue to be held on $10,000 cash in lieu of bond following an arraignment last Monday.

Anti-racist activists think that this bail is unnecessarily large, and is just another way for the Toledo government to continue to oppress members of this working class North Toledo neighborhood. Most people cannot afford to pay this huge sum of money, and everyone arrested is a local resident with roots in the community and thus not a flight risk. They are calling for people to act in solidarity with the anti-fascist arrestees and show the State that they cannot intimidate protesters into not acting against fascist threats. Bail money is urgently needed, and they are asking anyone who can to send money. Read more

 New Orleans Oct 23 2005 Forest Park Apartment Update 

 Residents of Forest Park Apartments, as a result of a fightback to defend access to affordable housing in hurricane ravaged New Orleans, have secured a series of concessions from the management of the Algiers housing complex. These concessions include pushing the request that residents vacate the complex from October 14, as originally demanded, to October 31. Management has also agreed to sign a written agreement that guarantees displaced residents will be allowed to return to the complex, when renovation work is completed, with no increase in rent. This position by the management of Forest Park marks a retreat from their previous position not to enter into any negotiations with the Forest Park Tenants Association. Up to this point, the management of the complex refused to guarantee that residents would be allowed to return with rent fees unchanged. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

They shouldn&apos;t. The questions go beyond the publication&apos;s dealings with Schweber, who for three years had freelanced for Manhattan Media, a publisher that otherwise publishes four community newspapers in Manhattan (and one glossy magazine, Avenue). Schweber says he was led to believe that the Standard was a community newspaper in Brooklyn. [Read More] Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 The renewed surge in counter-recruiting comes at a time when the Army is trying to rebound from its worst recruiting year in over a quarter century. In the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the Army fell 6,600 enlistees short of meeting its year-end recruiting goal of 80,000. The Army Reserves and Army National Guard experienced even steeper declines in their recruiting. The Army’s New York City recruiting battalion alone fell almost 2,000 enlistees short of its assigned goal of 3,858 new active duty recruits, according to a battalion spokesperson. With its nearly unlimited resources, the Army has responded by adding another $130 million to its advertising budget and bumping up its total number of recruiters to 12,000.

 Portland Oct 23 2005 New health care initiative is gathering petition signatures 

 Currently called Initiative 40, the HOPE for Oregon families ballot title reads: &quot;Requires access to health care as a fundamental right; Legislature must adopt plan expanding health care.&quot;
HOPE - led by chief petitioners Mitch Greenlick and State Senators Ben Westlund and Dr. Alan Bates - commissioned two questions on a recent poll. When asked if they would support that initiative, 71% of those polled responded affirmatively; 52% said they would strongly support that initiative which requires the Legislature to &quot;ensure residents access to basic health care.&quot;

Greenlick, who recently announced he has been diagnosed with cancer, and Westlund, also a cancer survivor, believe Oregonians understand the dilemma facing people who get seriously ill and don&apos;t have access to health care. &quot;No one should have to make the choice between food and medicine,&quot; said Greenlick. &quot;No one should be forced to suffer without adequate health care. It is clearly the Legislature&apos;s job - according to the results of this survey - to find the best ways to strengthen and improve our existing health care system and find ways to cover the 615,000 Oregonians with no health care.&quot;

Signatures for the constitutional amendment are already being collected. If you would like to help gather petition signatures, please contact state Rep. Mitch Greenlick.

 Long time 63-year-old Anarchist Prisoner survives yet another nazi attack

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 24 2005 San Francisco Board of Supervisors to Vote on Dispensing Regulations 

 On October 18th, Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi&apos;s bill regulating Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCD&apos;s) was debated before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. For three hours, various supervisors, including Maxwell, Alioto-Pier, Daly passed hostile amendments gutting the bill with zoning requirements which could effectively shut all or most dispensaries in the City (Supervisor Chris Daly won an amendment that adds large portions of South of Market as a no-medical cannabis dispensary zone). An additional issue of importance to medical marijuana patients is the threat of an amendment to kill the 99 plant/100 square foot plant canopy provision. Flyer A van will be bringing patients from the East Bay .

The bill was continued over to this week&apos;s hearing, which will be held on Tuesday, October 25th, 2005 at 2PM at San Francisco City Hall, Room 250. This may be the final vote on regulation of dispensing collectives in San Francisco. Medical marijuana advocates are encouraging people to voice their displeasure over this process and to show support for the City&apos;s MCDs. Organizations are also encouraged to write letters or make phone calls to the Board of Supervisors.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 24 2005 Students Hold Vigils Seeking Justice for WWII Veteranos 

 On Thursday, October 20, the Filipino Student Association (FSA) at UC Santa Cruz held a vigil to honor Filipino Veteranos from World War II by fighting for the benefits that they deserve.

Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos served under the United States in World War II, many of them receiving prestigious medals. While promised benefits by U.S. President Roosevelt, the U.S. Government refuses to acknowledge their contributions. Many of these Veteranos have since died, but an estimated 7,000 live in the U.S. and over 30,000 in the Philippines.

Thursday&apos;s vigil was part of a national day of awareness sponsored by Student Action for Veterans Equity (SAVE). The day was &quot;part of an ongoing campaign to &apos;paint the nation brown&apos;, stressing the awareness of the Brown Ribbon Campaign; an education and action campaign dedicated to the fight for Full Equity only and nothing less, through the passages of H.R. 302 and S. 146&quot;

Gray and three other men were accused of raping and killing Robin and Julie Kerry on the Chain of Rocks Bridge in 1991. The facts of the killings have been marred by police misconduct, racist accusations, and conflicting stories.

The Organization for Black Struggle , Affiliate of the Black Radical Congress, is making an urgent plea to all justice-seeking friends to stop the state murder of Marlin Gray. Gray has an execution date of Wednesday, October 26 at 12:01 am. They are holding a vigil October 25, 8:30-9:00 pm at St. Xavier Catholic Church, Lindell Blvd&amp;Grand.

 Boston Oct 24 2005 Harvard Janitors Fight For Real Living Wage; Will Students Muster Renewed Support? 

 Crashing cymbals, booming water cooler jugs and rattling shakers improvised from soda bottles and pebbles lent a boisterous sonic dimension to a rally by about 70 Harvard Janitors and a hand full of supporters outside the University&apos;s administrative offices on Massachusetts Ave. on the first Friday of October. While super enthusiastic, the rally, which marked the first formal effort to draw public attention to the new round of contract negotiations between the janitors, represented by SEIU 615 and university last month, was also notably for the absence of a contingent whom many familiar with recent labor struggles at the university might have considered a key element. Four years ago something between a gaggle and a gob of Harvard undergraduates were leading the charge at the university and across the country to achieve the outlandish utopian dream that folks they had far to much tact to refer to as ‘the help’ being paid a wage commensurate with the local cost of living.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 25 2005 October 22nd National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality 

 Saturday, October 22nd, 2005 was the 10th Annual National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression, and the Criminalization of a Generation. Police continue to brutally beat and kill people all over the United States, including in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina . Muslim, Arab, and South Asian immigrants are still being arrested, detained, and deported. Every year, people wear black on October 22nd to remember people who have died at the hands of the police. The October 22nd Coalition is part of the Stolen Lives Project, which documents cases of people who have died at the hands of law enforcement, and it says that murder by police is increasing. The &quot;Presente&quot; tradition of October 22nd | List of endorsers for October 22nd, 2005

In San Jose , some 75 people gathered for a rally and march in Emma Prusch Farm Park. Photos The protest was held in San Jose because over a dozen people have been killed by law enforcement in Santa Clara County in the two years since Cau Bich Tran was fatally shot by the San Jose police in 2003. New Stolen Lives Wall panels were made to include many of the people who have died in the last several years.

In Fresno , a Vigil For Lives Stolen by Police in the Valley was held on Saturday at 5:30 pm, at the park in front of the Main Library.
On Sunday, October 23rd , a Civil Rights Cookout was held at the Idriss Stelley Foundation offices in San Francisco.
On October 22nd , a Copwatch conference San Diego was attended by nearly 100 people . In Los Angeles , over 300 people attended a march that was stalled by a bomb scare. At around 4:00, there was a conflict between demonstrators and the police. Two teenagers were arrested. March organizers said, &quot;It is time to hold the murdering police accountable for the stolen lives of our loved ones! We must stand up against this system’s war on the people here in Los Angeles and all over the world! It is time to demand justice for all Stolen Lives!&quot; There was also a march to the police department in Santa Ana . The march was met by police on horses. Report and Photos 
In New York City , 100 people braved the rain forecast to carry on with the scheduled protest. Photos Many carried hand-drawn signs with photos of loved ones who had been killed by police.

 Many other cities held October 22nd protests: Greensboro, North Carolina ; Minneapolis, Minnesota ; Washington, DC ; Cleveland, Ohio ; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin were amongst them. Read more on the National October 22nd website

 Portland Oct 25 2005 Black Panther veterans jailed in San Francisco 

 Panthers still treated as nation&apos;s &apos;greatest threat to internal security&apos;
A San Francisco judge had two Black activists jailed Wednesday for refusing to cooperate with a state grand jury investigating a 30-year-old case. Ray Boudreaux and Richard Brown now join Hank Jones and Harold Taylor in San Francisco county jails.

Their attorneys argued that the grand jury procedures were abusive because the original indictments for a police shooting in 1971 resulted in the dismissal of charges when the U.S. government failed to disclose that their &quot;evidence&quot; was obtained by torturing at least three Black activists in New Orleans.

 Portland Oct 25 2005 Reportback-Press Conference announces 40 page report -The Primate Experimentation Scandal 

 On Wednesday October 19th, I attended a press conference given outside the Oregon National Primate Research Center. It was part of a nationwide tour of research facilities. The press conference was given by Michael Budkie, Executive Director of SAEN (Stop Animal Exploitation Now) to announce a 40 page national investigative report - &quot;The Primate Experimentation Scandal, 2005,&quot;.
The report, produced by SAEN, a research watchdog organization, links Vioxx and other similar drug scandals to fraudulent, taxpayer-funded research studies at laboratories across the nation, including those at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. It also provides extensive information about the use of primates, the increasing number of primates, redundancy of studies, etc. Quoted from the report summary :

&quot;Funding for primate experimentation is at an all time high with the overall estimate for federal spending on primate experimentation (including spending by the NIH, DOD, USDA, EPA, NSF, SBIR) is $1.6 billion. The number of primate grants funded by the National Institutes of Health has risen 67% in the last ten years. The funding of the Primate Research Center System has risen 379%% in the last six years to eclipse the $1 Billion mark.

On October 18th, Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi&apos;s bill regulating Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCD&apos;s) was debated before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. For three hours, various supervisors, including Maxwell, Alioto-Pier, Daly passed hostile amendments gutting the bill with zoning requirements which could effectively shut all or most dispensaries in the City (Supervisor Chris Daly won an amendment that adds large portions of South of Market as a no-medical cannabis dispensary zone).
The bill was continued over to this week&apos;s hearing, which will be held on Tuesday, October 25th, 2005 at 2PM at San Francisco City Hall, Room 250. This may be the final vote on regulation of dispensing collectives in San Francisco. Medical marijuana advocates are encouraging people to voice their displeasure over this process and to show support for the City&apos;s MCDs. Organizations are also encouraged to write letters or make phone calls to the Board of Supervisors.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 25 2005 Staniford Speaks Out on Animal Tests 

 Bearing signs saying “Liberate Primates” and “Stanford Kills Animals,” Stanford University graduate students, undergraduates, law students, and community members protested the use of animals in experiments at Stanford’s Research Animal Facility (RAF) on Friday, October 21. During a busy Friday rush hour that coincided with Stanford’s “Alumni Weekend,” the activists, members of Animal Rights on the Farm (ARF!), convened on El Camino Real, a major thoroughfare bordering Stanford University in Palo Alto. As passing vehicles honked enthusiastically in approval of the protest, the activists waived signs and distributed leaflets alerting drivers and pedestrians to the animal experimentation conducted on campus. The demonstration was held in commemoration of National Primate Liberation Week, and follows a recent on-campus press conference by Michael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now (SAEN). Budkie presented his group’s findings on animal research at Stanford. SAEN’s report details the use of hundreds of primates at the RAF, which ranks 21st nationally in terms of federal research dollars received. More info here .

 Portland Oct 25 2005 The Empire&apos;s Attack on Ojeda-Rios and Independence&quot;by Mumia Abu-Jamal 

 The September 23rd, 2005 attack and armed assault on Puerto Rican nationalist, Filiberto Ojeda Rios, left the family and his island without his proud and noble presence, but it did not achieve its real desired objective. The armed agents of Empire attacked the home and
family of the 72-year old revolutionary, shot him, and left him to bleed to death for hours in his home in Hormigueros, in the island&apos;s mountainous regions.

Dr. Hector Pesquera, president of the Hostosiano independence movement, nailed it when he said, of the heavily-armed FBI assault, &quot;They did not come to arrest Filiberto Ojeda, *they came to kill him*.&quot; Nor was it mere coincidence that the date the FBI chose to raid the Ojeda home was the island&apos;s day of national historical significance. Sept. 23rd was the 107th anniversary of &quot;El Grito de
Lares&quot;, when thousands of Puerto Ricans annually mark a day of resistance against the Spanish colonizers. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 New Orleans Oct 25 2005 Police Brutality Update 

 October 17th: In the week after New Orleans’ police brutality and arbitrary arrests became a national story, those practices appear to have continued unabated. On Oct. 15, two cousins were arrested for “trespassing” while walking on a sidewalk. Although they were non-violent -- they were not charged with any violence -- one cousin was beaten and shot with bags of small pellets. An officer also opened fire into their makeshift jail cell for no apparent reason, hitting several inmates with the pellet bags, including the other cousin. The full Associated Press videotape of police viciously beating 64-year-old Robert Davis and assaulting two witnesses is now available. CNN has released its own footage , showing Davis dripping blood. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt;

 For some reason, we had a &apos;good feeling&apos; about the outcome. How could the grand jury NOT make a decision for indictment? Again citizens stopped for fliers and to ask questions. Others continued to give support. Jeremy came all the way from Eugene for yet another day of support. Two young men who had heard of Fouad&apos;s death stopped and took up signs to stand with us for awhile. All along, there has been a positive atmosphere about this vigil...a hope for justice. That was all dashed at 12:15 when the word came (perfectly timed for corporate news) that there would be no indictment.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 25 2005 Rosa Parks Has Died 

 10/24/2005: Rosa Parks, died of natural causes Monday evening at her home in Detroit. She was 92.

&quot;It was 50 years ago this December that Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her seat to a white man aboard a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. She was arrested and convicted of violating the state’s segregation laws. Her act of resistance led to a 13-month boycott of the Montgomery bus system that would spark the civil rights movement. And it would inspire freedom struggles abroad including in South Africa. The bus boycott would also help transform a 26-year-old preacher named Martin Luther King Junior to national prominence. Rosa Parks’ arrest came just months after the lynching of Emmett Till.&quot;

 Houston Oct 25 2005 No Nonsense in November 

 Early voting has already started for the local elections taking place on November 8th. These elections have not garnered a large amount of coverage of the candidates or the issues being addressed. Mayor White is running with minimal opposition, but a number of city council races are heated.

Perhaps the most important issues facing voters are the propositions to modify the Texas constitution . The most controversial of these is Proposition 2 : “The constitutional amendment providing that marriage in this state consists only of the union of one man and one woman and prohibiting this state or a political subdivision of this state from creating or recognizing any legal status identical or similar to marriage.” Gay marriage is already against the law in Texas, and this proposition would make it part of the Texas constitution. This is part of a nationwide backlash against rights for the GLBTQ community 

Locally the No Nonsense in November Campaign has been organizing for the defeat of this proposition. This past Sunday they hosted a protest at Spotts Park in the Heights.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 25 2005 Two Thousand Too Many 

 &quot;Not one more death, not one more dollar for war!&quot; 

Join concerned citizens in cities across the US in a public candlelight vigil to mark the loss of the 2,000th US soldier in Iraq. Two thousand is too many, and we call upon the Bush Administration and all our elected officials to pull our men and women immediately out of this needless war. We call for an end to all death and injury, American and Iraqi alike. We call for an end to the occupation now! And we call for a return of the resources of Iraq to the Iraqi people.

 On the evening after the 2,000th death, come together at 7:00 PM at the Town Clock Park in the city of Santa Cruz (at the corner of Mission/Water Streets and Pacific Ave). Bring candles to hold shielded from the wind - and bring flowers, ribbons, shells, feathers, photos, poems, votive candles, and.... to create an altar in honor and in memory of those slain and injured. If you can, wear Black or White.

After the vigil we will march in a &quot;trail of tears&quot; down Pacific Avenue and up to Mission Park (by Holy Cross Church), the site of the original occupation and genocide on the land that we, here in Santa Cruz County, now inhabit, a thread that pervades our nation and lives on exponentially into Afghanistan and Iraq.

“The plan was to speak to the senator, our elected official, the woman that represents us. They ought to give us an opportunity to make our case.” said Reverend Peter Johnson after being turned away from Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison&apos;s office by a cadre of police Tuesday afternoon in Dallas.

The group, led by Civil Rights leaders Reverend L. Charles Stovall and Reverend Peter Johnson, wanted to discuss with Senator Hutchison her opinion on the two-thousandth dead U.S soldier since the war in Iraq began. They were denied access on the grounds that the building in which the senators office is located is private property closed to the public.

 A rally will be held at 12pm on Wednesday November 1st in front of San Jose City Hall (200 E. Santa Clara Street, San Jose, CA 95113) to protest delaying tactics by the City of San Jose in the case of the killing of Bich Cau Thi Tran. The City of San Jose has filed a Notice of Appeal in Tran v. City of San Jose. A trial date had originally been scheduled for November 1, 2005, and it was later rescheduled for December 2005. The delaying tactics by the City of San Jose may effectively deny the Tran family their day in court for 18 months to 2 years. Members of the Coalition for Justice and Accountability, or CJA, demand that the City of San Jose negotiate in good faith with the attorneys for the Tran family and allow justice to be heard by agreeing to a trial date in December of this year. CJA formed in 2003 following the death of Ms. Tran and has advocated for justice in the Tran case and for changes in police practices. Read more

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 26 2005 Livingston Foster Farms Workers on Strike 

 Hundreds of Foster Farms employees, upset about wages and working conditions, went on strike Tuesday at the company&apos;s largest chicken plant. Union leaders claimed that about 80 percent of the day shift stayed out and that much of the night shift would follow suit. &quot;We need respect,&quot; said 19-year employee Juana Santiago of Atwater, who works in packaging. &quot;We need better treatment from the foremen. There are people working 30 years getting $9.33 an hour. That&apos;s ridiculous.&quot; Walsh said the average wage is about $10.50 an hour, and health and other benefits bring total compensation close to $17 an hour. The workers are seeking 50-cent-per-hour wage increases in each of the next three years. Foster Farms has proposed no raise the first year, 15 cents the second and 20 cents the third. The employees rebuffed the company&apos;s offer in May and talks have been at a standstill since. They were represented by the League of Independent Workers of the San Joaquin Valley, which has since affiliated with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. &quot;We want the company to be fair with us, that&apos;s all, and realize that we are human, not slaves,&quot; said Singh, who said he makes $9.28 an hour on the processing line. Workers also complained about high health insurance costs, favoritism by supervisors, short notice of overtime shifts, pressure to increase production, and threats against union supporters. &quot;They treat us like product instead of employees, instead of people,&quot; said warehouse worker David Reos of Livingston, who has spent three years at Foster Farms.

 A recent ordinance to stop discrimination against people with criminal records in the city&apos;s hiring practices recently passed unanimously in Boston&apos;s city council. Activists say that this form of discrimination haunts those who have already served their time, creating a form of post-correctional incarceration when people are denied jobs, housing, and other basic needs. Activists are also saying that this type of dicrimination is deeply connected to racial discrimination. For more on the story, listen to the posted audio file.

 Boston Oct 26 2005 Inequality in America: version 2.0 

 Fall is inequality season. Every autumn, as the leaves change color, we get a vivid new picture of the trends that pull us apart as a country. This year is no different. But after almost three decades of incrementally widening disparities of wealth and income, it¹s worth noting that we¹ve entered a new version of economic apartheid, American-style. Let’s call it Inequality 2.0. The United States is now the third most unequal industrialized society after Russia and Mexico. This is not a club we want to be part of. Russia is a recovering kleptocracy, with a post-Soviet oligarchy enriched by looting. And Mexico, despite joining the rich-nations club of the Organization for Economic and Community Development, has some of the most glaring poverty in the hemisphere.

 Portland Oct 26 2005 Don&apos;t waste cops time with your stinkin&apos; bicycle accident and assault reports 

 I had just finished restoring a vintage 10 speed racer and took it out on foster in s.e portland. As I approached 68th(round table pizza) I heard angry swearing and after a few seconds turned my head to see &apos;what the...&apos; that was all about? My gaze was met by that of a man glaring right at me from his car just off to my rear. Before I had the chance to question in myself why he would be swearing and looking at me?..he swerved his car right into me. He hit me so hard with the right side of his car that it sent me flying over the sidewalk and into the Round Table pizza parking lot. Even though I had a helmet on it did not protect the side of my face from the asphalt scrub I got from hitting the ground. Damaged my just restored bike too.

Then, as if this guy had not just done something criminal ENOUGH, he stopped right in traffic and walked over and punched me in the face. I saw that coming and pepper sprayed him...but not before the WHAM. He got back in his Chevy Caprice (oregon license: MARILU), and drove away. A tri met bus driver who saw the whole thing gave me his number and so did a car with four adults who were stuck behind the guy when he stopped to assault me(further). So I had the injury and the evidence as good as anybody would need to get some action on this insane driver. Right?????

 Portland Oct 26 2005 Rosa Parks, Misremembered 

 Rosa Parks died yesterday at age 92. Over the days to come, we&apos;ll hear a lot of very-much deserved prasie for Parks&apos; refusal to abide bigotry and her courage in the service of a cause. Unfortunately, we&apos;ll also hear a new round of recitations of the stubborn myth that Parks was an anonymous, apolitical woman who spontaneously refused to yield to authority and in so doing inspired a movement.
The truth, as Aldon Morris wrote in his book The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement, is that a decade earlier in the 1940s Mrs. Parks had refused several times to comply with segregation rules on the buses. In the early 1940s Mrs. Parks was ejected from a bus for failing to comply. The very same bus driver who ejected her that time was the one who had her arrested on December 1, 1955...She began serving as secretary for the local NAACP in 1943 and still held that post when arrested in 1955...In the early 1940s Mrs. Parks organized the local NAACP Youth Council...During the 1950s the youth in this organization attempted to borrow books from a white library. They also took rides and sat in the front seats of segregated buses, then returned to the Youth Council to discuss their acts of defiance with Mrs. Parks.

This history is not hidden. But the Times&apos; obituary describes Parks&apos; arrest nonetheless as an event which &quot;turned a very private woman into a reluctant symbol and torchbearer...&quot; Parks was certainly reluctant to see too personal valoration of her as heroine distract from the broader movement. But she was not private about her politics. And her refusal to give up her bus seat was nothing new for her. As she would later tell an interviewer, &quot;My resistance to being mistreated on the buses and anywhere else was just a regular thing with me and not just that day.&quot;

 Portland Oct 27 2005 Ban Terminator Seeds - Join The Global Campaign 

 Unfortunately Terminator is not yesterday&apos;s news. Corporations and governments are again pushing hard to commercialize Terminator technology - plants that are genetically modified to render sterile seeds at harvest. The Canadian government tried to overturn the international (United Nations) de facto moratorium on Terminator in February 2005. To meet this new crisis and re-build global opposition, we ask you to join the new Ban Terminator Campaign and take action with us.
Mobilization is needed now to pressure governments to ban Terminator nationally and internationally. There are two important United Nations meetings coming up where debates on Terminator are planned. We will work to establish a ban on Terminator at the major meetings of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity: January 23-27 in Spain and March 20-31 in Brazil.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 27 2005 Common Ground Collective Calls for Help for Displaced New Orleans Residents 

 
The Common Ground collective is asking people to visit the New Orleans evacuees in their area’s shelters and talk with them about efforts that are being made to get them home. This can be done by printing out the 9th Ward flyer and bringing it to shelters. Information and talking points can be obtained by going to CommonGroundRelief.org and by calling Common Ground&apos;s 9th Ward Coordinator, Brandon Darby at 512-912-8000.

Common Ground Collective efforts have begun to take shape in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. The 9th Ward gained international media attention after the severe flooding during the week of Hurricane Katrina, along with the human rights violations and neglect the residents suffered at the hands of the New Orleans Police Department and the State government of Louisiana.

Local realtors and businesses are pushing to have the entire area bulldozed so the city can get a &quot;new face.&quot; Garbage, decaying animals, and other debris remain untouched while other areas in the city are receiving services. Common Ground volunteers are currently placing information sheets on every door of the 9th Ward urging residents to return home, organize, help each other, and resist the city&apos;s efforts to destroy their community for profits. Community meetings where residents can share thoughts and solutions will be announced soon.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 27 2005 Livingston Foster Farms Workers on Strike 

 Hundreds of Foster Farms employees, upset about wages and working conditions, went on strike Tuesday at the company&apos;s largest chicken plant. Union leaders claimed that about 80 percent of the day shift stayed out and that much of the night shift would follow suit. The workers&apos; average wage is about $10.50 an hour, and health and other benefits bring total compensation close to $17 an hour. The workers are seeking 50-cent-per-hour wage increases in each of the next three years. Foster Farms has proposed no raise the first year, 15 cents the second and 20 cents the third. Workers also complained about high health insurance costs, favoritism by supervisors, short notice of overtime shifts, pressure to increase production, and threats against union supporters. The employees rebuffed the company&apos;s offer in May and talks have been at a standstill since. Their organization, the League of Independent Workers of the San Joaquin Valley, is affiliated with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Read more

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 27 2005 Halloween Action Planned for October 28th to Unmask Hateful Talk Radio 

 On Friday, October 28th , a month after Bill Bennett aired a racist remark about aborting black babies, Bay Area protesters will conduct a Halloween-themed direct action to revoke the broadcast license of host station 910 am KNEW.

Bennett is not the only KNEW talk show host to make hateful comments- Michael Savage routinely calls immigrants “vermin” who are “raping, stealing, murdering and defecating on our lawns”. Protesters say this content is grounds for revoking KNEW’s broadcast license. “We’ve petitioned the FCC to revoke KNEW’s license because Clear Channel should not be given a license to hate,” says Taishi Duchicela, an organizer for the Youth Media Council.

The direct action against KNEW will take place on Friday from 4:30pm to 6:00pm at Clear Channel Headquarters, at 340 Townsend Street between 4th and 5th Streets in San Francisco . Protesters will be wearing Halloween masks, doing a street theater piece to expose the hateful content on 910AM KNEW, and taking direct action to deliver a legal petition to deny Clear Channel’s license to broadcast KNEW as well as 106.1 KMEL, WILD 94.9, and 92.3 KSJO in San Jose.

 Portland Oct 27 2005 Not One More Death, Not One More Dollar Vigil 

 
Late this afternoon and into the early evening voices were raised in Portland Oregon memorializing the 2000 U.S. soldiers and countless Iraqis who have died in Iraq during the invasion and occupation. After a few brief comments by Kelly Campbell of the American Friends Service Committee, people lined up and took turns reading off the names of the dead, the soldiers, the Iraqi civilians, the children.

The litany of outrage and sorrow continued for what seemed a lifetime, a prayer and a gong rang out for lives cut short and offered on the altar of greed and indifference. The greed and avarice of a powerful few and the apathy and indifference of the majority of Americans who are content to sit idly by while their government forcibly occupies a sovereign nation, daily murdering its people.

Vancouver Vigil

 Den Mark: We had about 130 at our Vancouver vigil. Lots of lights, some hard-to-hear words, a few songs, &quot;Taps&quot; on a live trumpet. A good event. It was interrupted a couple times by the screeching of jets over the Columbia from the Portland base. I wonder if they did that intentionally.

 gk: The rain held off in the dark, cool air as about 115 people gathered in a large circle. After opening readings and description of a solemn ceremony, some people broke out with peace songs, and a half dozen people spoke through a microphone. Another asked for veterans, and then veteran families to step into the circle. Some clapped for them.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 28 2005 Speak Out For The Lompico Creek Headwaters Area - Nov. 2nd 

 Public Hearing on the Lompico Headwaters Timber Harvest Plan 

The Lompico Watershed Conservancy needs your help to stop a potentially devastating Timber Harvest Plan . The plan would involve cutting old growth trees on the lands in and around the watershed. This would not only cause disruption of the environment and habitat destruction, it would also signficantly destabilize the land, creating erosion and potential landslide risks.

The Public Hearing for this logging plan is tentatively scheduled for November 2nd, 7:00 PM at the Zayante Fire House on 7700 E. Zayante Rd. across from the Trout Farm Inn in the Zayante area of Felton. 

Please attend this hearing. The hearing in 2001 was attended by over 200 area residents and was a remarkable event. Having a strong presence at this meeting can have a considerable effect on the outcome. We stopped the last Headwaters THP. Now we will have to do it again.

 Portland Oct 29 2005 Venezuelan ambassador speaking in Portland Saturday October 29th! 

 Bernardo Alvarez, Venezuela&apos;s ambassador to the United States, will be speaking at Portland State University this Saturday, October 29, on alternatives to &quot;free trade&quot; in Latin America, the political changes that have taken place under Hugo Chavez, and Venezuela&apos;s relations with the United States.

Since Hugo Chavez took power in 1998, his government has faced consistent hostility from the United States, which culminated in a US-sponsored coup attempt in 2002. Chavez, who identifies as a socialist, has been the most outspoken critic of &quot;free trade&quot; of any leader in the Western Hemisphere, except perhaps Fidel Castro. This, and Venezuela&apos;s oil wealth, make him a serious threat to US dominance in the Americas.

 Portland Oct 29 2005 MARTIAL LAW SURVIVAL GUIDE 

 This article will start off assuming that the Reader (you) is already subject to MARTIAL LAW; that is, the &quot;suspension&quot; of the Constitution. Curfews, rationing of basic goods, enforced relocations, confiscation of firearms and supplies, and summary arrest/execution by soldiers, paramilitary police and other jack booted chumps in black wielding assault rifles. Basic survival tips will be followed by more detailed ideals on how to counter this coup against the American People.

The remainder will apply IF you&apos;re reading this before MARTIAL LAW is imposed by the current corrupt government. IF you are reading this while you still nominally under Constitutional Law, it&apos;s urgent you read from the beginning to end so as to appreciate the opportunities you currently have to not only protect yourself and yours, but to attempt to stop a coup.

 Urbana-Champaign Oct 29 2005 Silencing the Violence of War 

 Mainstream media have blood on their hands. That is one lesson we can draw from official apologies for pre-Iraq War coverage, beginning with the New York Times’s public confession in May 2004. Typically, these “media culpas” confessed being overly credulous in accepting the Bush administration’s rationale for war. They attributed mistakes to good-intentioned professionalism and innocent oversight, but not systemic or individual failures. (To their increasing embarrassment, the Times’s apology conveniently failed to note Judith Miller’s byline on four of the six articles singled out as seriously flawed). Perhaps media elites assumed that tepid apologies and strategic ambiguity would inoculate them against further scrutiny. As passive consumers of news, we’d accept that there’s nothing to see here; better to move along, keep quiet and go shopping. Media have apologized and we can rest assured that now they’re getting it right. Of course, this doesn’t stand up to a nanosecond of scrutiny. There is now little doubt that media helped sell an illegal war –– for which they have yet to come clean –– but ongoing coverage continues to normalize and even glorify barbaric aspects of war by daily serving up an antiseptic version of events in Iraq.

 Portland Oct 29 2005 Justice: Oppose the Drug Free Zone 

 If you seek justice, please stand and voice oppostion to this unconstitutional Drug Free Zone (DFZ). At last months Boise neighbourhood association meeting, the attendees voted overwhelmiongly to oppose the DFZ. This is a community that is 100% inside a DFZ, and also an historically minorty and low income community. It is a truly radical stance to say NO! to this practice and at least defend justice. (Just as a side note, the Boise neighbourhood is where Kendra James was murdered a few years ago by racist police).
Currently a police officer has the power to stop a person for suspicion, and if any drug paraphenilia is found, that officer alone has the power to ban a person from the area for 90 days. There is no review or fighting it, even if you live within the area, you are restricted for 90 days (if you live in the area you are permitted to go to and from your house, but not anywhere else, unless with a written court order). This is supremely racist and classist, as many of us know the tools of law are hardest to obtain for those that need it most. So effectively the people that are punished under the DFZ are guilty no matter what. It is a bad cycle.

As community members, and justice seekers we have a chance to strike down this &quot;law&quot;. We can stand in opposition to it. At the upcoming community meeting Tuesday November 1st from 6:30 to 8:00 pm at the Emmanuel Temple (1032 N. Sumner) . Please, wherever you live, come to this meeting and voice your opposition the the DFZ!

 New Orleans Oct 30 2005 Assault by New Orleans, Federal Police on resident and mainstream media producer caught on tape 

 October 9th: The numerous accounts of escalated police harassment and violence after Hurricane Katrina reported on NOLA Indymedia, many of them first reported here, (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) are getting unprecedented corroboration in the corporate media when an Associated Press TV camera caught the beating of a 64-year old man in the French Quarter Saturday, October 8th. After being ordered to stop filming, an officer attacked the AP producer accompanying the cameraperson. Some (but not all) officers involved have been suspended. Read the AP story and watch the tape here.

The NOPD has a long history of brutality and corruption, including the apparent theft of Cadillacs from a dealership as tens of thousands of residents were trapped without transportation, food, water or shelter in the wake of Katrina. Yet the AP reports that two of the five police that committed the assaults were federal officers, suggesting recent police violence in New Orleans cannot be explained as merely due to a corrupt departmental culture. This comes as information has surfaced that hundreds of National Guard troops (engineers) were in a separate part of the Convention Center throughout the horrendous ordeal of thousands there, but did not intervene.

 San Diego Oct 30 2005 The No Border Movement Goes to Sacramento 

 
The mintuemen had planned a press conference on the steps of the california capitol today to announce their initiative for the california border patrol and show how great they are. A diverse group from all over California including working class people and directly affected communities showed up to say otherwise.

The minutemen were walled off from the protesters by CHP, horses and riot cops. About 350-500 protesters from San Francisco, San Diego and other cities were there to try to disrupt the event and provide a counterpoint to their racist messages. Less than half as many people, 150, were at the Minutemen rally.

While the Minutemen were making their speeches, numerous people tried to get past the lines to disrupt the activities. The Sacramento police used tazers numerous times. The sound of tazers clicking were &quot;all over the place&quot;. One protester was held to the ground and tazered at the same time. There were 3 arrests, including one felony arrest with a 30,000 bail for a protester who was allegedly &quot;resisting arrest&quot;. Demonstrators describd the police actions as &quot;brutal&quot;, saying they were charging the crowd and &quot;a lot of people ewre getting beat up&quot;.

 NYC Oct 30 2005 Halloween Critical Mass 

 Several smaller groups of riders originating from various locations collected into 2 main groups of 200 or so which moved separately around Manhattan. Both groups made a pass through Times Square. Smiling traffic cops waved our group through. It was great to mass through Times Square for the first time in many months.

For some reason the cops left the ride alone. I don&apos;t know of any arrests. There was a helicopter overhead and a number of scooter cops around Union Square. I mused that the authorities were respecting the holiday and having a temporary cease-fire. A more realistic theory was offered that the fascists were called off due to the upcoming mayoral elections.

 Santa Cruz, CA Oct 30 2005 The People Confront Racist Minutemen in Sacramento 

 
 Activists, including the Watsonville Brown Berets, disrupt Minutemen rally on the steps of the Capital 


On October 29, 2005, about one hundred Minutemen, a racist vigilante group, staged a rally on the steps of the State Capitol in Sacramento in order to gain support for an initiative that would create a state police force specifically responsible for enforcing federal immigration law. More than one thousand organizers, immigrant rights groups, students and families staged a spirited and emotionally energized counter protest on the length of the sidewalk in front of the Capitol steps where the Vigilantes held their program. Protecting the vigilante group were various police agencies, including the CHP and Sacramento police, who stood between the dissenting factions. 
 
Protesters carried signs demanding an end to terrorism on immigrants and that no human is illegal. Several politicians, including Peter Camejo, Green Party candidate, addressed the crowd of protesters and denounced the proposed measure and the Minutemen. The police, utilizing excessivly brutal force, arrested one demonstrator for standing on the street. Arnold Schwarzenegger has publicly supported the Minutemen. Jim Gilchrist, a founder of the Minutemen and the Save Our State Initiative, is planning on a run for Congress in 2006.

 sacprisonersupport@riseup.net writes : there were actually 4 arrests (if not more). 2 were released, one is pending release (resisting arrest), and one santa cruz resident is still in jail on two felony counts.

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 31 2005 Common Ground Collective Calls for Help for Displaced New Orleans Residents 

 The Common Ground collective is asking people to visit the New Orleans evacuees in their area’s shelters and talk with them about efforts that are being made to get them home. This can be done by printing out the 9th Ward flyer and bringing it to shelters. Information and talking points can be obtained by going to http://www.commongroundrelief.org and by calling Common Ground&apos;s 9th Ward Coordinator, Brandon Darby.

The Common Ground Collective reports that efforts have begun to take shape in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. The 9th Ward gained international media attention after the severe flooding during the week of Hurricane Katrina, along with the human rights violations and neglect the residents suffered at the hands of the New Orleans Police Department and the State government of Louisiana.

Local realtors and businesses are pushing to have the entire area bulldozed so the city can get a &quot;new face.&quot; Common Ground volunteers are currently placing information sheets on every door of the 9th Ward urging residents to return home, organize, help each other, and resist the city&apos;s efforts to destroy their community for profits. Community meetings where residents can share thoughts and solutions will be announced soon.

 Portland Oct 31 2005 Tre Arrow - Latest Update and Call Out 

 Hello to you all out there. It&apos;s Tre from behind these walls at Wilkie. I&apos;m not jazzed about being locked up, but if I have to be, I am grateful to be here. Most of the staff is kind and the administration has made a concerted effort to accommodate my raw vegan diet. I can see and feel the rays of grandfather sun and grandmother moon. I can breath in fresh air through the metal grate covering the open part of my window. I&apos;ve heard birds chirping outside my window, and have watched them pouncing on the grass, jerking and capturing the earthworms from the soil. I have been able to get outside and feel the cool, soft grass beneath my feet. I attended a sweat lodge ceremony with an elder native named Ron, along with three other prisoners...
In case you missed the last call out or have recently joined the supporters list, I&apos;m inclosing the previous message dealing with a crucial letter writing campaign to the Canadian Minister of Justice, and newspaper editors across the continent. These letters are an extremely important act of support and solidarity for me and my legal defense. This is an opportunity for you as my concerned supporters to eliminate the feeling of helplessness that many have expressed. This simple, tangible act of sharing your thoughts and feelings can be extremely empowering. This gives you the chance to have your words documented, your voice heard, and can have a dramatic impact on the Minister&apos;s decision whether or not to extradite me.

 Portland Oct 31 2005 Organic Food Labeling Compromised 

 INDUSTRY SNEAK ATTACK ON ORGANIC STANDARDS RAMMED THROUGH CONGRESS Despite receiving over 350,000 letters and phone calls from OCA members and the organic community, Republican leaders in &quot;Congress voted last night to weaken the national organic standards that consumers count on to preserve the integrity of the organic label,&quot; said Ronnie Cummins, National Director of the Organic Consumers Association. As passed, the amendment allows: Numerous synthetic food additives and processing aids, including over 500 food contact substances, to be used in organic foods without public review. Young dairy cows to continue to be treated with antibiotics and fed genetically engineered feed prior to being converted to organic production. Loopholes under which non-organic ingredients could be substituted for organic ingredients without any notification of the public based on &quot;emergency decrees.&quot;
Please, where-ever you buy your &quot;organic&quot; food, ask a manager or fill out a comment card on how they plan to deal with the new rules about labeling. This was an inside job, it seems, and bigtime food corps are trying to hijack the organic marketplace. They&apos;ve been at it for a while, but this is a big victory for them and a loss for those looking to feed themselves well. Buy Local: People&apos;s Co-op Alberta St. Co-op | Food Front

 San Francisco Bay Area Oct 31 2005 Support Needed For Those Arrested at Minutemen Protest 

 The Bay Area Coalition to Fight the Minutemen called for an action to oppose the Minutemen Project&apos;s rally to gather public support for their attempts to harass poor, undocumented border-crossers and to announce their support of a new initiative that would establish a state border police in addition to the existing federal border patrol.

There was a rally on the West Capitol steps in Sacramento on Saturday October 29th . It featured the founder of the Minutemen Project, Jim Gilchrist, and the legislative sponsors of the California Border Police Initiative, amongst others. About 600 people representing anti-racist groups throughout California arrived at the Capitol in busses and carpools from the Bay Area and the Central Valley to confront the Minutemen. Among those attending the protest against the vigilantes were Mexican American Political Association National President Nativo Lopez, former Green Party gubernatorial candidate Peter Camejo, and representatives from Bay Area Coalition to Fight the Minutemen, Deport the Migra Coalition, Zapatista Solidarity Coalition, Brown Syndicate, various anarchist collectives, and other statewide organizations. Three people were arrested Saturday at an anti Minuteman rally at the State Capitol, and two were treated for injuries. Photos | Press Release on Arrrests | Read more

 Memphis, TN: October 31, 2005. Today Colonel Nicolas Carranza, former Vice-Minister of Defense of El Salvador, comes face-to-face with five individuals who accuse him of torture, extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity. The trial is expected to last about three weeks. This is the first time Carranza has ever had to answer accusations that he oversaw widespread human rights violations in El Salvador. Carranza came to the United States in 1985 and settled in Memphis. He became a U.S. citizen in 1991. Read the original&gt;&gt; - or - Archived local copy&gt;&gt; 

 Portland Nov 01 2005 Dr. Dhafir Sentenced October 27th 

 Dr. Dhafir was sentenced today, in Syracuse. The place was packed and silent. When Dr. Dhafir came in the room everyone about 100 people stood in respect of him. It lasted about 3 hours from 9:30 am to 12:00 noon He is a highly respected and peaceful man in the Muslim community and in the general Central New York area. He has been sentenced to around 22 yrs, I believe, more details to come from the news tonight or tomorrow.

The case of Rafil Dhafir, a Syracuse NY based oncologist of Muslim faith and Iraqi descent, shows what can happen when a zealous justice department (FBI) and an eager prosecution are willing to bend the rules to win a conviction. To our knowledge he is the only person to convicted of breaking the sanctions against Iraq.

 Portland Nov 01 2005 E-Mails Needed on Fee Hearing! 

 Pasted below is an action alert from our friends at Western Slope No Fee Coalition . We all have an immediate opportunity to provide decision makers in the US Senate with much-needed public comment about the implementation of the RAT. These Senators know there are problems. They just don&apos;t know how bad those problems are or where, specifically, they are occurring. This is an call for E-MAILS. Please help. Thank You. 
The Senate Subcommittee hearing held on Wednesday, October 26th to review implementation of the new fee law, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA), presented plentiful evidence of agency overreach beyond the letter and the intent of the law. On our side is the fact that the Senate unanimously passed Sen. Craig Thomas&apos;s (R-WY) bill in 2004, which made permanent Park Service fees ONLY, and would have allowed US Forest Service, BLM and US Fish&amp;Wildlife Service recreation fees to lapse. Key Senators were extremely upset when the FLREA was foisted on them with no opportunity for debate, hearings or a vote, as a rider attached to a must-pass spending bill in Dec 2004.

vital to the success of our efforts to curtail the agencies&apos; overreach in the implementation of the FLREA is YOUR INPUT to Washington DC! Quite simply, more will happen, and faster, if an unprecedented number of emails are received at the offices of the Subcommittee. Written public testimony is being accepted into the official record of the hearing until November 4th

 NYC Nov 01 2005 NYU Grad Student Union Authorizes Strike 

 NYU Graduate Students, through GSOC/Local 2110 UAW, have authorized a strike this morning which will result in a complete stoppage of work by graduate students in response to the administration&apos;s refusal to renew their contract, which expired on August 31, 2005 (the National Labor Relations Board, composed largely of apointees from a reactionary Bush administration, determined, contrary to a 2000 ruling, that universities do not have to negotiate with graduate student unions). A contract &quot;offered&quot; to the union by the administration in August was &quot;little more than a public relations stunt&quot; which acquiesced to none of the principal demands in an acceptable fashion.

The graduate students and their union have the overwhelming support of undergraduate students, faculty, and the rest of the NYU community. The administration must now show what its priorities are through its response to the strike.
