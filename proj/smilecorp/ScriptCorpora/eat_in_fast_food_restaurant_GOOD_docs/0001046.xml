By popular demand- I&apos;ve put together a list of items from the top fast food chains that I recommend as an occasional treat that won&apos;t derail your weight management goals .

Let me first say that I do not recommend eating fast food meals on a diet if you don&apos;t already! Fast food is not healthy (and watch out for trusting &quot;healthy options&quot; like salads too). But I realize that many people, including myself, enjoy the indulgence, and it can be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet when you are smart about balance and moderation.

All of these sandwich and entree options are around 250 calories (leaving you some room for a healthy side and beverage) and under 10g of fat. Or click for a list of Weight Watchers Points Plus values .

As far as fries... I&apos;m sorry, most of these rated worse than many of the single sandwich options. If you&apos;re craving fries like crazy- order only a junior or small fry and have it with your low calorie meal from home. Otherwise, consider carrying around an apple to fill the role of side or desert when eating out. You can also take your sandwiches home and oven roast some healthy sweet potato fries . Another option is a plain baked potato, if you enjoy them without any butter or sourcream. (There also aren&apos;t many diet food options for any sort of ice cream treat or chicken nugget, so I recommend the same for these items- either treat yourself as a component of a healthier home meal or replace them with something healthier from home)

For beverages- water is always best, but most places now have sugar-free and fat-free coffee drinks and no calorie teas. Not only are these flavorful alternatives to soda, they&apos;re high in antioxidants.

Fast food should be an OCCASIONAL TREAT- a reward for some achievement, or something to look forward to at the end of the week or once a month (around the time all your bills are due?), but it doesn&apos;t have to be such a splurge that you throw aside everything you know about eating right. And because we are lucky enough to live in a free market society- the more you demand healthier options, the more that restaurants have to make them available. Just look at how much the menus have changed in the last 10-15 years! Stop buying the crap, and they&apos;ll stop selling it.

Oh, and one last note... sorry, but... eat breakfast at home! :-D

Is it necessary to eat in such fast-food restaurant?

Good Question! It absolutely is not. But many of us either end up there socially and are tempted, or just really enjoy the food. I myself indulge from time to time. It is still important though to be smart when ordering fast food, if you do. And definitely limit how often you treat yourself.

I think the term &apos;healthy&apos; is being thrown around a bit much here, few of the items listed could really be considered healthy...

However I do see your point and it is a well written hub! Although I would say just avoid eating fast food completely if you&apos;re on a diet!

Good point Mac- but don&apos;t you think that it is obvious by now that no fast food is healthy? Perhaps not and I should emphasize it. I never say that fast food is healthy but it can be part of a healthy diet- IN MODERATION. It is important in adherence for dieters that they not feel overly restricted and make change gradually. Most of us do end up, at some point, in a fast food restaurant and want to make a better choice than we are used to. In addition to anything I address here- there are preservatives, additives, fillers, high sodium and trans fats in fast food and the full picture undoubtedly reveals that it is best to avoid fast food all together. Many clients I have worked with have been unwilling to do so, but this can help them make a better, if not the best, choice.

Thank you for the Feedback!
