 Answers: England is renouned for it&apos;s Fish [served in batter] chips and mushy peas. Although England is swamped with American foods such as macdonalds, pizza hut ect. ect. but when i visited the states i couldn&apos;t find a fish&amp;chip shop ANYWHERE! Buffalo , New York and here abouts . On Fridays most taverns serve a fine batter fried Haddock and fries (chips) with cole slaw , macaroni or potato salad . The mushy peas can be had at several&apos;Pubs&apos;&apos;at boast&apos;em . Best to check the Restaurant Guidebooks or BFLO web page. Some taverns use a seasoned bread-crumb fried Haddock. So y&apos;ih gotta&apos;check. Yes, They (taverns) boast publicly and in their advertisements about being the&apos;Best fish-fry in Western New York&apos;(State). Have fun, Sittingmoose, Sous-Chef Sicilliano Emeritus and Welsh Shaman....it&apos;s a long story....Ciao. Long John Silver maybe Red Lobster, and Jack in the Box has fish and chips.

US fast-food restaurant chains that sell fish and chips include Long John Silver&apos;s, Arthur Treacher&apos;s Fish and Chips, Captain D&apos;s, H. Salt Esquire (in California), and Ivar&apos;s and Skipper&apos;s (in the Pacific Northwest). Most of these chains refer to fish and chips as&quot;fish and fries&quot;or as&quot;combo baskets&quot;, as opposed to&quot;platters&quot;(which include coleslaw, however the term&quot;chips&quot;still occurs frequently in the Northwest and Western United States when discussing this dish. (See Burgerville, which generally also serves its baskets with a lemon wedge. A Western United States&quot;combo basket&quot;will often include an additional side dish such as beans or coleslaw, especially in a pub setting.) In the 1990s, the perception within the United States of fish and chips as unhealthy led to a decline in consumption and to financial problems for Long John Silver&apos;s and Arthur Treacher&apos;s. Other restaurants have acquired these two brands, and the current growth-strategy of both of these chains appears to aim at combining fish-and-chips with other fast food brands to bolster them in the marketplace and to introduce new customers to the meal as a novelty. But some specialist restaurants prepare fish and chips in the full Commonwealth tradition — such as The Park Slope Chipshop in New York City. ChipShop NYC plans to spread around America by franchising. In Canada, Joey&apos;s Only Seafood Restaurants figure prominently in the fish-and-chips market with over 100 locations. There are still a few around one is called London Fish and Chips and that is just down the road from us. I think its a franchise. No love... I am sorry we don&apos;t no. However Long John Silver is most similar.
It is a greasy fast food fish restaurant, using the word loosely, with a tacky pirate theme.

but people in the north east may be more fortunate.

wow all 4 people who like long jon silvers are here, thats amazing Haha, really? There&apos;s tons of&apos;em.
I think the people who answered&quot;no&quot;must live in the middle of nowhere. It&apos;s not as popular as some other kinds of foods though. I mean, come on, how famous is English food really? Apart from the fish and chips the cuisine is internationally considered to be a bit drab. We have alot of Irish pubs that feature fish and chips as well. Oh, we have them, they are just not very good. Greasy and tasteless. Be happy you missed out . yeah there are some,
there are even&apos;seafood restaraunt chains&apos;like Long John Silver&apos;s (my fav) and Captain D&apos;s.
it&apos;s not common to see a fish and chips restaraunt here, and I live in brooklyn, pizza and greasy chinese food here. depends on where you go We don&apos;t really have fish and chip places. The only place I can think of is Long John Silvers which are few and far between these days. I don&apos;t like the quality of their food though. For something fresh, I&apos;d reccommend going to a pier or dock if you&apos;re on the east or west coast...the food is fresh and caught daily...other than those... not too many people specialize in fish and chips here...America is all about hamburgers...I guess that&apos;s our signature...just like fish and chips is your country&apos;s. i think they exist on the east coast i saw it on cooking shows and restaurants in northern USA that have them. down south we fry our fish in spicy cornmeal batter serve with hush puppies, tator tots, or crispy fries. They have commercial ones,&quot;capt&apos;D&apos;s&quot;and&quot;Arthur Treachers&quot;. In the north east there are homegrown, independant clam places. We used to go to this place called&quot;Vinnie&apos;s drive in&quot;where you could get those chinese food take-out boxes full of delicious fried clams. In the south you can find places that fry fish but they are definately southern. Some of them put spices like&quot;Old Bay&quot;in the batter. The chips are almost always American French Frys. I have never seen the mushy peas but I am aware of them. There are a lot of restaurants around me that serve fish and chips. I&apos;m not a fan of seafood, so I can&apos;t tell you how good it is.
Here&apos;s one for example:
 http://www.limeyspubonline.com 

Also, almost every restaurant along the beach sells fish and chips. Never having had the pleasure of trying a true fish and chip shop I can&apos;t tell you if any of our independent shops would be familiar to you. The chain restaurants that have been mentioned previously are quite variable in their product. You can find fried fish and chips in most diners, and it can be either very good or very bad. Growing up we use to have a place that did fried haddock and chips and every Friday night there would be a long line waiting to place their orders and take the fish home for dinner. Not sure if there was a place to sit and eat or not

I do hope that dispite not finding a fish and chip shop that you did find some better choices than just our&quot;fast food&quot;places when you visited. Come again and try our regional restaurants. almost any good seafood restaurant here in the states has fish and chips on the menu. In the northeast/ new england states, they do. I&apos;ve never seen anything anywhere else except for a fast food place that doesn&apos;t look very appealing! Not like in the UK! Arthur&apos;s Treacher&apos;s was decent but most have closed down. Long John Silver&apos;s is just AWFUL.

The absolute best fish&amp;chips shop is SALT&amp;BATTERY in NYC: most authentic, traditional and delicious!

 http://www.asaltandbattery.com/ We used to, but I have not seen any authetic ones in years. We used to have a franchise here names Arthur Treachers, and they offered two chips and steak fries with a coke for $4.99 and it was GOOD. America is HUGE, sweetie... there is one of everything if you know where to find it. There are even Englishmen who have moved here and opened&quot;authentic&quot;Fish&apos;n&apos;Chip shops because they were tired of Friday-night yobbos peeing on the outsides of their stores.

&quot;Arthur Treacher&apos;s&quot;once had about 950 shops in America. I&apos;m an ex pat living in Canada and have been all over the US and I always manage to find battered fish and chips. You couldn&apos;t have looked very hard. Besides fast food areas in Shopping Malls you will find them in most restaurants.
Can&apos;t say Americans like mushy peas.

They don&apos;t have chippies in most places but the do have them in California, specifically around Los Angeles. They also have some places in Virginia, also a lot of ex pats.

Americans have a great deal more to offer than fish&amp;chips and curries.
