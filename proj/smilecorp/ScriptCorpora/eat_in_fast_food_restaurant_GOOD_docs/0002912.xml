 The YAM Network (Auction ends Thursday, July 12, 2012!) 
 The Biological Clock Of Impending Doom 
 Bank | Los Angeles, CA, USA | 
 (Please note that I am a young looking 21 year old. I am processing a transaction for an older gentleman.) 

 Me: “Is there anything else I can do for you today, sir?”

 Customer: “Are you…” *mumbles incoherently* 

 Me: *thinking he said something else* “Oh, yes, I’m new! I’m [name].”

 Customer: “No, no, I asked if you were married .”

 Me: “What? Um, no, I’m not married. Not yet.”

 Customer: “Well, you’d better get on that.” *stares judgmentally and walks away*

 Cash Back (And Forth) 
 Drugstore | Gulfport, MS, USA | Money Issues , Top 
 (I am a cashier at a drugstore. A man is buying about $60 worth of merchandise.) 

 Customer: “Can I pay $40 in cash and put the rest on my debit card?”

 Me: “Sure.”

 (I take his money and give him his new total. He swipes his card and the machine asks him if he wants cash back.) 

 Customer: “Oh, yes, I DO want cash back!”

 (He gets $20 in cash back. I look at the $40 in my hand and slowly hand one of his 20′s back to him.) 

 Customer: *has a moment of clarity* “Hm, that didn’t make much sense, did it?”

 Me: “No, sir, not really.”

 (He leaves with his head down in shame, clutching a $20 bill.)

 They Grow Up So Fast, Part 2 
 Retail | California, USA | Children , Parents 
 (I am working one night in the children’s department. An older man approaches me about buying clothes for his son. Normally, the children’s department only carries clothes for infants, toddlers, and elementary school aged kids.) 

 Customer: “Excuse me, I’m looking for some clothes for my son. Is there anything you would recommend?”

 Me: “The skate and surf wear brands are very popular. Would you like to have a look?”

 Customer: “Yes, please.”

 (I show him around and let him shop for a few minutes. He later approaches me.) 

 Customer: “I’m not sure if these clothes will fit my son. Is it okay if we return them in case they don’t fit?”

 Me: “Of course. Just making sure, how old is your son?”

 Customer: “18.”

 Me: “18 months?”

 Customer: “No, 18 years.”

 Me: “Sir, this area is primarily for infants and toddlers. You’ll want to look in the young men’s department.”

 Customer: “Are you sure, miss?”

 Me: “Yes, sir, I’m positive.”

 A Horse Can Lead Itself To Water 
 Dentist | East Coast, USA | Extra Stupid , Health&amp;Sickness , Top 
 (My father is a dentist, and he is known among his dentist friends for having insane patients. This one really takes the cake, though.) 

 Dental Office: “Good morning, this is Dr. [name]‘s office. How may I help
you?”

 Ma Earth Thanks You Anyway 
 Office Supply Store | Baltimore, MD, USA | 
 (When I ring out customers with small items or few things, I ask if they want a plastic bag in the interest of not wasting one on something small.) 

 Me: “And did you want a bag for your pen, sir?”

 Customer: “No, thanks. I just want the receipt. Save the tree.”

 Me: *looks questioningly* “Sir, the bag is plastic. It doesn’t come from trees.”

 Customer: “Whatever. Something about dolphins and the Amazon…” *walks out*

 Not A Shred Of Intelligence 
 College , library | Orange County, NY, USA | Physical , Students , Top 
 (It’s finals week and a student approaches our help desk.) 

 Student: “Your copy machine isn’t working. My papers wont come out.”

 Me: “It’s probably jammed. I’ll have my coworker fix that for you.”

 (My coworker follows the student to the copy machines. After a few minutes, the student runs by me in tears. My coworker comes back a few moments later.) 

 Me: “What happened?!”

 Coworker: “She used the shredder instead of the copy machine.”

 Don’t Mess With The Lez 
 Theatre | Boston, MA, USA | Bigotry , Top 
 (I have a small nose stud. As I’m taking an old man’s tickets, he reaches out and pokes my nose ring.) 

 Customer: *in a rude, judgmental tone* “So, what’s this for?”

 Me: “It’s a signal to the other lesbians.”

 Customer: *makes a horrified face and scurries away*
