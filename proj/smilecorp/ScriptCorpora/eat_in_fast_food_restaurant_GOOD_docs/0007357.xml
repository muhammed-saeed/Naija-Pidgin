Automats, Cafeterias, Diners, and Lunchrooms
 
In the nineteenth century, few restaurants served food that workingmen could afford. As America industrialized, food delivery systems were invented to meet this new demand, including lunch wagons and diners. The first lunch wagon was launched by Walter Scott of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1872. He parked his wagon at a downtown intersection and sold sandwiches to night workers through a service window.

Lunch wagons improved over the years. Some wagons created a place for customers to stand inside at a counter, which was particularly helpful in inclement weather. Next came stools so customers could sit and eat their food. In 1897, Thomas Buckley began mass-producing lunch wagons. The diner evolved from the lunch wagon. Patrick Tierney of New Rochelle, New York, upgraded the wagon into something resembling a railroad dining car. Customers at first sat on stools located along a counter; later versions offered booths for customers and waitresses to service tables.

The diner was basically a small restaurant, not much different from a main street or highway café. Its advantage was its modular construction. It was relatively inexpensive to build, buy, and maintain. If a particular site proved unsuccessful, the diner could easily be disassembled and moved to another location. Various restaurants, such as White Castle and White Tower, employed diner concepts. For instance, fast food restaurant chains are based on modular construction of their outlets. Another way of serving food efficiently was the self-service cafeteria, where the customers emulated an assembly line. They picked up trays, utensils, and napkins, proceeded down a long counter containing foods in trays heated by hot water. Customers picked the foods that they wanted and placed them on their trays, while employees punched the customer&apos;s tickets, noting which foods the customers took. Customers then sat at a table and ate the food.

When finished, customers presented the punched ticket at the door, paid the bill, and departed. Cafeterias appeared almost simultaneously in the Midwest and the West and East coasts during the late nineteenth century. California became known as the&quot;cafeteria belt,&quot;although it was in the South that the cafeteria became a culinary institution.
 
Early cafeterias were oft en operated by the Young Women&apos;s Christian Association (YWCA) and other nonprofit groups for the poor and workingmen. By 1906, however, they were being run as profit-making enterprises. The key to a cafeteria&apos;s success was the scale of its operation. It required a bigger investment and a greater volume of customers than did other restaurants. It also required more space for a larger kitchen to prepare the food and an increased seating capacity. Cafeterias were widely adopted in factories as a means of quickly serving food to workers; cafeterias were also commonly operated in other institutional settings, such as schools, hospitals, and military installations. Another attempt to industrialize the food system was the automat, which dispensed food through banks of windows. The idea had been perfected in Europe and was in use in the United States by the late nineteenth century. The most famous chain of automats was started in 1902 by Philadelphians Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart, who ordered the mechanisms from a German firm that installed food vending machines in European train stations. In automats, food was prepared in advance and placed in glass compartments so that customers could see what they were getting. To remove the food, customers were required to place coins in slots and turn a knob, which opened the glass doors.

The food could be sandwiches, salads, or desserts. Heated or refrigerated compartments provided hot and cold food. Empty compartments could then be filled by workers who prepared food behind the row of machines. By 1912, Horn and Hardart had four establishments in Philadelphia and began opening automats in New York City. By 1950, the company operated 50 automats. Within 30 years, all except two would be closed, the firm having converted most of its operations to Burger King outlets. Yet another means of feeding working class peoples emerged-the lunchroom. Most lunchrooms were mom-and-pop establishments that sold candy, baked goods, and other products. By the 1920s, lunchroom chains began to develop in large cities. Most chains had only two or three establishments. These shared a name and were advertised as a system. Large chains might also have had central food distribution and preparation.

One such chain was W. F. Schrafft &apos;s, launched by Frank Shattuck in 1898 as a candy store in Boston. By 1915, Schrafft &apos;s had extended its operation to New York City and Syracuse. By 1922, the chain had 22 stores. Fast food chains, which emerged during the 1920s, incorporated aspects of automats, cafeterias, and lunchrooms. Some emulations failed, such as White Tower &apos;s experiment with its Tower-O-Matic restaurants, which tried to imitate Horn and Hardart&apos;s automats by serving hamburgers and other fast foods in machines. However, similar to cafeterias but unlike full-service restaurants, fast food operations were self-service. Unlike lunch wagons but similar to cafeterias, fast food outlets were permanent structures. Similar to lunch wagons but not to cafeterias and restaurants, fast food chain customers stood in line to order food, employees packed the order, and gave customers the food. Similar to lunch wagons and food stands but unlike diners and cafeterias, early fast food chain menus were limited and customers did not eat the food inside the outlet.
