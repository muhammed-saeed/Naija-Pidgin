 History 
SONIC Drive-In traces corporate history to a chain of root beer and hot dog stands known as Top Hat. When the original Top Hat location provided drive-up speaker ordering boxes, business tripled. The original SONIC founders, Troy N. Smith Sr. and Charles Woodrow Pappe, started the first company franchise with a single handshake and no firm franchising requirements. When the two men discovered the name Top Hat already existed as a trademark, the duo changed company names to SONIC. As the company grew, SONIC began offering standardized menus from most locations.

 Special Services 
SONIC Drive-In restaurants offer burgers, coneys, hot dogs, milkshakes, coffee, soft drinks, and several other traditional roadside hamburger stand fare. SONIC offers carside service and still allows customers to order from speaker boxes mounted throughout the SONIC parking lot. Carhops deliver food directly to automobiles and some locations even allow carhops to work on roller skates. Many SONIC Drive-In restaurants also offer drive-thru windows for patrons on the go.

 Community Involvement 
As a large restaurant business with grassroots company history, SONIC understands the importance of giving back to the communities supporting its business. SONIC regularly donates to support local and national charities providing services to improve education and academic opportunity. SONIC works with national charities, like DonorsChoose.org, to sponsor charitable programs, such as the Limeades for Learning national cause.

 Environmental 
With such a large business, SONIC Drive-In strives to keep its corporate carbon footprint in check. SONIC restaurants participate in local recycling and waste management programs. The business also works to ensure welfare for the animals destined to end up as SONIC menu options. SONIC works to ensure every supplier meets or exceeds the government regulated guidelines for animal treatment.

 Planned Expansion 
SONIC Drive-In fast food restaurants operate in most of the fifty states in the U.S. As of April 2011, SONIC announced national expansion plans but no international expansion plans. SONIC operates more than 3,500 restaurants across the U.S. and plans to continue aggressive expansion throughout the nation.

Hello,

My name is Devonte W and I am a college student at the time. I worked at a Sonic location in Winston-Salem NC about two years ago and I am seeking to return. Knowing that I have some experience in the Sonic world I don’t feel like it would be to hard to catch up and begin working with the team and progressing forward. I’m really interested in working with this company again. I am very energetic and love to maintain a positive environment while providing great service to paying costumers.
