 It might be easier if they go through the drive-thru. And have them come either later in the evening (like an hour before closing) when your manager is in the back doing paperwork or during a busy rush period. They can go back through the drive thru and say you forgot to give them something from their order. During the rush period you can bag up extra stuff for them without anyone noticing. But tell them not to do it too often because getting fired for trying to hook your friends up is embarassing.

 I used to do this when I worked at McD&apos;s in the early 90&apos;s. I often times worked drive-thru and friends of mine would come through occasionally. If I was working as a presenter (DT orders) or window (cashier), I&apos;d simply add a few extra sandwiches and fries to the bag. I told my friends I could get them extra food, but not totally free-they&apos;d have to order something so it didn&apos;t seem suspicious. If it was busy, the other workers never noticed or cared; they&apos;re not really paying attention to what you&apos;re doing unless it&apos;s causing a problem.

 I am a manager at mcd&apos;s and I get people fired all the time for giving free food to their friends or taking it just because. If you like your job don&apos;t do it. I know...you don&apos;t even want to hear it. You work to make money. After awhile the managers will start to watch you more closely. It just takes one slip up and you get your pink slip.

 These people really think you are a push over and a dweeb to ask you to give them food. They don&apos;t care about you at all!

Why would you steal for someone who doesn&apos;t even like you?

 Do that only if you don&apos;t care about keeping your job and don&apos;t care if you get fired (and may arrested for theft).
