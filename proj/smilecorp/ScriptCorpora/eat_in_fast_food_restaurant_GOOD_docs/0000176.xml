 Mind Your Language 
 Posted on May 24, 2011 by Max 
My next project to max up my mind is to mind my language. Ever noticed how some people start off a sentence with a phrase like,“I’m not going to lie to you but….”, or,“I don’t want to sound critical but….”. When lying or sounding critical is exactly what they’re about to do.

Even worse are the people that say things like,“I hope you’re not going to take offence at this but…”. With the implication being that you probably WILL take offence and, if you do, you’re somehow over-reacting! I may have even (face/palm) used phrases like this myself. But no more.

As Bill McFarlan points out in his wonderful book Drop the Pink Elephant we all have a tendency to pay far more attention to the words we write than the words we say. And this can get us into all sorts of trouble when we blurt out the‘pink elephants’–the words that focus our listener’s attention on the things that our uppermost in our minds rather than the idea we want to get across. As in the example above,“I don’t want to sound critical but…”signals to our listener that what’s coming up IS critical and we risk angering and alienating them before they even know what we’re talking about.

So I’m going to pay more attention to what I’m saying from now on and if I feel I absolutely must offer a suggestion to someone else I’m going to try and do it in a more positive way.

 Memories Are Made Of This.. 
 Posted on May 13, 2011 by Max 
 What’s your memory like? Mine is pretty shocking.

In fact, it’s a standing joke in my family that I forget pretty much everything. A conversation about events in the past runs like that song by Lerner and Loewe:

 
 
 We met at nine, we met at eight. I was on time, no, you were late, Ah, yes! I remember it well. 
 
So one of my goals is to improve my memory.

There seem to be several different techniques around and one I’ve tried, and found to work, is based on using vivid images and context to link different things together. Known, logically enough, as the Linking Method, this technique can be really helpful, for example, if you’re in a situation where you’re meeting a lot of new people at once and need to remember names and other details. I’ve read about this method from a number of authors, most recently from Derren Brown in his book“ Tricks of the Mind “. I had a go myself and was surprised to find I could remember most of the items on a list of random, unrelated words even months later. The trick is to find something that will connect the words and to make that an image in your mind–the more funny, striking and vivid the better.

To show how it works I’m going to put down a list of just ten random words. Now instead of looking at them and trying to remember by rote, I’m going to connect each word to the next by using images. In this way a kind of (ridiculous) story develops. As each image is‘seen’, the next word on the list is triggered and eventually you find you’ve remembered everything.

Here’s how I do it. I’ve put the list of ten random words below and outlined what images I would use to link them. But everyone is different so the images I come up with may not mean anything to someone else. So to prove to yourself it really does work make up your own list–try ten words at first. Then, once you get a feel for it, increase the list to twenty words. It’s important once you’ve done this to go over your list a few times to fix it in your memory. Ideally, create your images and go over it once straightaway, then again about half an hour later and then again the next day. Each time make sure the images connecting the words are as bright and as vivid as you can make them. Anyway, here’s the list I came up with:

 Bank Skipping Dream Poker Cup Label Think Battle Wig Goat 

OK. First word is Bank and second word is Skipping so I’m seeing an image of a girl looking like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz skipping in through the front doors of a bank. Like Dorothy, she’s got bright red, sparkly shoes on that glint in the sunlight.

To link Skipping to Dream I’m seeing the image of the girl/Dorothy skipping to the tune of John Lennon’s #9 Dream .  John Lennon himself is in the bank standing on the counter with a guitar and a microphone singing the song.

Linking Dream to Poker,…is the image of the backing singers on #9 Dream sat at a poker table wearing visors and with their sleeves rolled up singing into their microphones. The skipping girl/Dorothy sits down and plays Poker with them…

Linking Poker to Cup,…in the centre of the table is a gold Cup as big as a sporting trophy with two huge handles on it. The singers dressed as poker players are throwing their chips into the cup. The chips make a loud rattling sound each time they’re thrown in….

Linking Cup to Label,…The cup has a large white, cheap-looking Label on the side with‘I AM A LABEL’printed in colours which flash and pulse to the music…

Linking Label to Think,…the cup can speak (Harry Potter-type thing!) and its voice suddenly booms out,“You are a Label and I am a Cup and I think therefore I am.”.“A thinking cup!”, gasp all the singers/poker players and all suddenly sit in the pose of that statue‘The Thinker’by Rodin….

Linking Think to Battle,….and then a battle breaks out between the poker players for the cup. Their microphones morph into light sabers as they battle to and fro….

Linking Battle to Wig,…..one singer/poker player takes a swipe at another, dislodging a wig he’s wearing. His head is completely bald underneath….

Linking Wig to Goat,….except for a very large tattoo of a hugh goat on the top of his head.

Reading that makes it seem a bit long-winded but in practice, the mind whizzes through the images quickly and I find I can rattle off all the items in seconds.

The only drawback I can find to this method is that each item is remembered sequentially. If I do happen to forget one of the images, the rest of the list can be lost as well as remembering each item depends on the links from the previous item. There are other memory techniques out there that get around this issue and I’ll write about them in another post.

 Motivation 
 Posted on April 27, 2011 by Max 
I’m on my sickbed this week so this is just a short post as I take a break from coughing and spluttering. Here’s a quick video to give me the inspiration to get on with all those jobs and chores that have backed up while I’ve been ill……..

 Beware Timeshare/Holiday Club Touts Bearing Scratchcards 
 Posted on April 19, 2011 by Max 
 I like to think of myself as fairly sharp and on the ball. Not the sort of person who’s easily duped. So it came as a bit of a shock recently to find myself nearly taken in by the sort of relentless sales pitch that I’d always imagined only the naive and gullible falling for.

Luckily, I escaped before I’d pulled out my credit card but it was a close thing. And the fact that I fell for it at all has given me pause for thought. All is not lost though–I’ve used the experience to try and analyse that sales process that the company used, my response to it and at what points I should have been more wary. Here is what happened and what I’ve learned from it:

 I was on holiday abroad with my partner and we were stopped as we left our hotel by a guy in a car handing out scratchcards. He said that he worked for a 5* hotel just outside the main tourist area that was promoting itself with some free prizes so it became better known. Surprise, surprise! one of our scratchcards won–the prize was either a‘dream holiday’, cash or a camcorder. All we had to do to find out which one and claim it was to sit through a short presentation about the hotel–he told us it would take a maximum of 90 minutes but in fact usually only took about 20 minutes. The guy was jumping up and down at this point - there were only two winning tickets issued per day and not only had we got one of them (he was very excited for us) but he also would get a bonus (which he was just as happy about). To save time he would kindly drive us up to the hotel in his car and they would provide us with a taxi back to the resort once we had claimed the prize. (OK, let’s analyse what’s happened so far. Leaving aside the general unwisdom of getting into a car driven by a total stranger, how were my strings being pulled here? Firstly, I was on holiday and so was relaxed and off my guard–no way would I entertain any of this back home but it seems that my natural caution got left behind at the airport. Secondly, I had won something! Who doesn’t like winning? And something for nothing–all I had to do was listen to a short promo about the hotel? What’s not to like? Of course, I would guess now that at least every other scratchcard was a‘winner’and the stuff about‘just a way of promoting a hotel that was a little out of the way’and a presentation that would‘only take about 20 minutes’was being severely economical with the truth. And what’s the clincher here? Well, the poor guy (who was a total stranger don’t forget!) wouldn’t get his bonus if I didn’t go and claim the prize immediately–how bad would I feel then?) Once at the hotel’s sales office (which was miles from anywhere) a nice receptionist established that we were a) together, b) homeowners, c) not on a promotional trip and d) had a credit card with us. Then we were handed over to a salesman, who was very personable and friendly, as they usually are. But it became clear that the‘holiday club’they were‘promoting’was actually a form of Timeshare Exchange. And the apartment he showed us in the hotel was nowhere near 5*. And the‘annual free week’s holiday + a 2nd week for minimal cost’was actually the timeshare weeks, paid for by the annual membership fees. But after three hours of selling (!), the last of which I had spent telling them that I wasn’t going to sign up for anything there and then, and asking for the car to take us back, we finally escaped, Oh, and I was so hacked off at this point I didn’t even bother to claim the prize, which was the‘dream holiday’(probably an unused timeshare apartment in some grotty resort out of season). (The sales tactics used were very persuasive–I was shown a glossy brochure of hotels all over the world where I could book up holidays, savings on the cost of holidays was emphasised, particularly the‘free week’and that I could use my membership to book holidays for family and friends–it looked like a fantastic deal. BUT there were a few things that made me wary. The first was that the’5* hotel’was clearly nothing of the kind–the accommodation consisted of apartments and was more 3* standard–if he had exaggerated about this, what other information had been left out or bigged up? There was no way of knowing because the Club didn’t have any promo literature or anything in writing for me to take away. The second, and this was the biggie, was their insistence that the deal was available only there and then–if I walked away without signing up the deal would never be open to me again. I don’t like being pressured at the best of times, let alone when I’m being asked for money. So luckily I backed off and got away without handing over any money.) 

 I’m glad I had this experience but very, very glad I didn’t succumb to the sales techniques. I’ve been checking the net since I’ve arrived home and seen a bunch of stuff complaining about scams, bad service, trouble getting money back, etc. For those interested here’s a warning article by the Office of Fair Trading in the UK and the US State Department also issues warnings to its citizens to beware of timeshare sales tactics in many locations. 

 Remember: be on your guard!
 Don’t commit to anything until you’ve read the small print and have had a chance to think it over.

 Life needs passion 
 Posted on April 13, 2011 by Max 
A bit of music this week. There are some pieces of music that just get under your skin and make you feel happy whenever you hear them. I’ve got a‘Happy’playlist that’s full of music that lifts me up whenever I hear it.

One of the best for this is Elbow’s‘One Day Like This’. But it’s even better when you see the video for the song as well–makes me feel good every time I see it.

Lesson:
Do it like you mean it.
Do it with spirit.
Do it with passion.
Give yourself to the moment.
