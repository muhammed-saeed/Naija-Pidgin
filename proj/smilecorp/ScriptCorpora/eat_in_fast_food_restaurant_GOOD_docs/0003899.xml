		Who Does the Grocery Shopping in Your Family? 

 April 15th, 2010 in Restaurants 
 


 The Star Tribune provides a look into a recent survey about eating/shopping habits of families in 2009 and a look back 30 years prior to 1979 and how the numbers have changed. Apparently this particular ad was less a‘FAIL’and more a‘WIN’than Failblog would like you to believe.
According to the article back in September of 1979 75% of all households dined together, 2% said they had dinner at a fast-food restaurant the day prior, 94% of women did the family grocery shopping, 4% of men were the primary shopper for their households, and 2% of husbands cooked the entire meal on their own.




Fast forward to 2009 when several different surveys provide some insight into how that has changed–drastically. Now less than half of all families dine together (47%), 27% of households ate at a fast-food restaurant in the last week (the article admits that this is not an apples-to-apples comparison), and 38% of men now do all the grocery shopping for their family.

Now as many of you know I do all of the cooking in my house, 99% of the shopping, and we generally do not dine out at fast-food restaurants (we did yesterday as I was starving on my way home from the airport–I’m owned) and we always eat together. But what I’m wondering about are the distributions in your own homes. Who does the cooking, who does the shopping, and do you eat together? For those of you who were family people back in the late 1970s and early 1980s have things changed?

Growing up as a kid, living at home, we almost always ate together as a family, unless dad was out of town on business. Fast forward to high school, college, jobs and more activities going on, it wasn’t an every day event, but most nights we sat down together and had our dinner at least.

Today–We both will go shopping together most of the time, unless we missed something, and stop after work etc. I do a majority of the cooking, but the other half pitches in as well.–We usually are out to eat once a week on Saturday, usually at Bill’s favorite, BW3′s or we might regress to Chinese takeout on a Sunday evening.

It’s just more cost effective to prepare a meal for the both of us, plan ahead, and take a little extra time to make a good meal at home vs. spend 10$ on fast food. We have to do enough of that during the summer with all of our weekend warrior road trips to various shows.

- If last weekend is any precursor to the summers eating, I’ll be packing sammiches, because my system just doesn’t like Mc Burger Curly Toasted foods anymore..

Back to the topic, we both do the shopping, gets us out of the house for an hour, and we can gawk at people.

I hate shopping and that includes for food, so my wife takes care of that.

I don’t like cooking since it’s much faster to pour a bowl of cereal and I’ll enjoy it about as much. (I fully admit, this is a major character flaw…) My wife cooks.

And yes, we eat as a family. Usually…

Usually Husband and I do major shopping early Saturday morning. The kids are old enough to be left home snoozing while we take care of the grocery shopping. For small items needed during the week…that gets taken care of on the way home from work by the person closest to the store that has what we need. When the kids were small, I worked part-time. I did most of the shopping during those years. We have always eaten together nearly every night. Sometimes, due to sports, it’s a little late but it happens. One thing I have found really interesting is how amazed our kid’s friends are that our family “makes our own food” and “always sets the table.” They don’t report critically but they have told me, when they eat at other people’s houses they are often served food from a box and the food is scooped up as kids scatter to different parts of the house to eat in front of screens.
I can’t even begin to express the benefits of home cooked family meals. I feel pretty confident my kids will cook and take care of themselves well when they move out. I have adult friends that don’t know how to make mashed potatoes or hard-boil eggs. These are intelligent successful people. One common thread though, they were raised on boxed food eating in front of TV. Of course the TV only enforces the whole idea with endless commercials for fast and convenience food. Pause… for a moment of gratitude for my mother and mother-in-law for being great mentors (both dads died very young). Kids learn so much by being a part of feeding the family. It’s not just learning to cook. For example, we make our own; Naan, sushi, and jerky and the kids learn about geography and other cultures.
Just last night Husband and I were discussing the popularity of places like Subway and Jimmy John’s. Both places were packed last night at 8 pm. I pondered…in this economy, who the heck is spending all that money on sandwiches for Pete’s sake? Husband contended…people just don’t make their own food any more-not even sandwiches. I think this phenom is a big factor in the fattening up of America and is worth further discussion. It’s important for kids to know where their food comes from and how it gets to the table. Mealtime is a great time-out from a stressful world. It’s a time to relax, to enjoy conversation, to be a family.
Oh- and, I’m not going to lie, it’s a lot of work and sometimes I do think it would be kind of nice to hand my kids a Jimmy John’s sub and send them off to sit in front of the TV 

Bill, Bill, Bill….disappointing. At least humor us and let us know what you chose.

Grocery shopping and cooking, like everything else when you have three kids 8 and under, is done by whoever happens to have the opening on their calendar at the moment. I prefer to shop and cook, and though I don’t keep track, I think I do more of the cooking. Given the choice I would do 100% of the cooking and grocery shopping.

We eat dinner together every night and I plan on making that a priority for as long as the kids are in the house. We don’t have a TV anywhere near the kitchen and never will.

As for fast food, that’s just an unfortunate part of being on the go. I would say at least 80 percent of what we eat as a family is cooked from scratch, so I don’t really worry about the occasional pizza or McDonalds. When we want to measure how we’re doing, we ask the kids what their favorite foods are—restaurant/packaged foods almost never show up on the radar so we must be doing something right.

It does mystify me when I see a Subway or fast food joint doing business right next to a better option. The biggest head scratcher for me is in Roseville where you have Subway five feet from Mavericks which has outstanding sandwiches. The inner snob in me always thinks,“those idiots have no idea what they’re missing”.

I cook. I shop. This is mostly because I work from home and have the flexibility. Last time my husband&amp;I went shopping, I had two observations. He was one of those husbands that is always in the middle of the aisle and in the way. And we had a lot more crap food in the cart. His skills are much better suited to fixing our cars, mowing, painting and the like. He is an excellent grill master though.

As far as eating together, we do most of the time. Our household shrinks and expands depending on the time of year. It should be permanently down to just my husband and I and the youngest come September. With the older kids home, it is hard to eat together because their work schedules are all over the place. They should both have grown up jobs in place soon. And to be honest, they would rather live elsewhere, but are forced to be here until they get on their feet economically. Growing up, we all ate together, home cooked or a bucket of chicken. Now, I strive for Sunday night dinners with the whole crew.

Report from the front line of American Families-
Sankary home- except for the first week of the month the Sankary family dines at home together. Not much conversation is had, but we do eat toghter.

We almost never eat out.. fast food or otherwise. In the day we would eat out 3X a week, for the last few years it’s been 4 or 5 times a year. No kidding. Pizza delivery to the house went from once a week to once a month or less. We’re nesting now for some reason.

I do 90% of the food shopping. Mrs S does the rest of the shopping. (essentials and fill in trips)

I do 99% of the cooking. Mrs S sucks at it, and hates it. The kids have NO interest in cooking AT ALL. This causes me to get pissy about being a short order cook for bunch of whiny.. never mind.. that’s not the point of this.

Now when I was a kid- back in the late 60′s and 70′s.. we ate home most of the time, but the food was terrible. Thinking back I hated it then and I would hate it now. Asparagus from cans, broccoli boiled for 45 minutes until it was pale green and limp. Steaks cooked under the broiler until they were leather, the only fish we ate was sole, also cooked under the broiler for 30 minutes until flavor and texture had been removed.

Oh and then the fun of coffee. After dinner the folks would make a couple cups of instant Folgers and light up a couple heaters and sit and read or talk or what ever they did. Times have sure changed. :)

McDonald’s–yes, I was that desperate and man was it ever awful. I ordered two regular hamburgers (nothing else) and all I could taste was the sodium. They were saltier than the fries my wife ordered.

After the amazing food I just had in Seattle (post is coming at 10:30) I cannot believe I ended on that note. Yuck.

We split cooking 50/50, though it often ends up more 60-40 (me-him). We buy our groceries online, together, but before we did that we went shopping together every week.

I noticed that this only includes cooking , and not cleaning up after said meal. That would be a telling stat, especially if it’s self-reported (husbands say they clean up after the meal ##% of the time, while wives say their husbands clean up ##% of the time). As much as we strive to have gender equity in our home, it is rarely applied to cleaning (not like I haven’t tried to fix that).

I love to hear what everybody does! I find it so interesting, those inner workings of relationships and responsibilities and what have you.

Kelly,

It’s 99.9% cooking for me and I’m guessing 90/10“cleanup”(me/her) after dinner. I guess it depends on what your definition of“cleanup”is however. If you mean just moving the plates from the dining room to the kitchen and then leaving them there, I’m guessing the ratio is more in her favor ;-)

I like Kelly’s idea for a survey! I’d like to know who’s cleaning up the kitchen the most and who thinks they are cleaning up the kitchen the most. I’d also like to know if we are the only people without a dishwasher. At our house we all help clear everything up and wipe down all the counters and stove. Then we take turns washing all the darn dishes. There is alot of grumbling about washing dishes.

I do all the grocery shopping, but it’s all via Coborn’s delivers, with the exception of tomatoes, which I have never been happy with from Coborn’s. Hubs and I both currently have 1-hour + commutes, so the convenience of having the groceries waiting when we get home outweighs almost any argument for going to the grocery store (except the tomatoes). So while I do the shopping, it’s not a big chore.

I do most of the cooking, grilling included, and Hubs cleans up.

Mrs Marcos spoils me with dinner and kitchen stuff like I’m Ward Cleaver and not supposed to be in there. We hardly ever eat at a dinner table though–usually in the den in front of our dueling computers and TV. I end up just grabbing a salad or snacking when I’m not home at dinner time, which is usually a few times a week.

Definitely a change from when I was a kid in the 70s/80s. Mom made a fully-prepared sit down meal every night no matter what else was going on. We went out once a week to a family restaurant. It was so rare that we had fast food or even something packaged that we thought THAT was the treat. I thought Steak-Ums were the coolest, but I had to settle for freshly cut sautéed steak tips more often.

But if I stopped multitasking long enough to sit down and just eat dinner, I wouldn’t be able to do all the important……. all the important……. all the dumb stuff I do.

We usually shop for groceries together, though we each make the occasional side trip for a few items depending on the circumstances. I’d say I cook about 60% of the time nowadays, though it’s been as high as 90% in the past. Neither of us hates cooking, but we don’t love it either—it’s utilitarian for us; something we do because we can’t eat out all the time. If we do eat out, it’s probably fast food or takeout due to being in a hurry. We do eat together if we’re both home, though we do so in front of our computers/ the TV (we don’t have a separate dining area from our living room, and our kitchen is way too small to eat in).

Growing up, my mother did all of the shopping and the cooking (being a stay-at-home parent made that easier), and we all ate together at the kitchen table when we were home at the same time. The idea of not eating at the table was never even raised. We didn’t eat out often and it tended to be something we did on special occasions or if we were traveling.

Ironically I just had this conversation at my volunteer job this morning. We discussed how we’re getting to the point where we can make food at home better than eating out (or as good as) PLUS we’re responsible for the service&amp;timeliness of the food! :-)

Otherwise, I do 99.9% of the cooking because I work part time and can do it during the week while the man&amp;kids are doing their“jobs.”When child #2 was born the 4 of us went to Cub one day—disaster x1000. I saw the SimonDelivers truck in the neighborhood that afternoon&amp;that’s how we survived that first year.

We eat together almost every meal but weekday lunch. The kids are not yet super busy with sports/activities so that helps too. I cook weeknight meals, hubby grills something awesome on the weekend and we work it out for the gaps.
