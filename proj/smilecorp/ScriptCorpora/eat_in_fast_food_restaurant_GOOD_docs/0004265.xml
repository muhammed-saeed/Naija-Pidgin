说道：So, to make a summary, this actirle wants to talk about how to grasp more potential users through function expanding forward-looking, and maybe this opinion comes from the news about Apple design-- to think more over your users&apos; need and supply porducts to lead a trend , make them know about future tecnology and get them close to it.So under this precondition, Mr Little Horse took out a detail to suggest renren.com to add Sort Algorithm for the sake of offering efficient information gathering. He believes a forward-looking function will make renren.com(or other popular websites) more sexy, since there are big mess and has made browsing more heavily.Since I am not a professinal website designer, I quite understand the spirit Apple owns, and quite understand we all want to make user-experience more lightly, I give out my thinking-after about practical maneuverability(可操作性) is to analyse the foundation of renren.com firstly for getting clear of their users&apos; different requirements, so as to assess the profit ----don&apos;t forget the most important thing for a company is forever-profit.---- and under this preparation, suggestions will be made, or it&apos;s just a suggestion.So, it depends on whether you just want to give a suggestion, or you want to offer excellent codes, or you want to think like a CEO.

My first response is to say YES it is a very uusefl piece of equipment. But then I have to restrain myself and factor in that depending on your habits it may or may not be.But personally I love it it has helped me tremendously at work, in meetings, doing research, brainstorming, drafting out new ideas with diagrams, reading (AWESOME for reading) etc.. So you if you are inclined to do any of these things then I think you would love it.Also different professions could have great use for them. Anyone that spends a lot of time offsite or away from their desk but are required a lot of note taking would find a tablet very uusefl. As well I definitely would have killed for one of these babies when I was in school.I guess the bottom line is that if you are someone that a) takes a lot of notes b) works in groups or with clients c) drafts diagrams d) does a lot of research e) reads a lot then a tablet would be a great investment.The price for these guys is getting better and better and they are finally being built with some guts to them. There are actually some decent models out now that can serve as a legitimate notebook replacement. The one I have lacks power for heavy duty work (Photoshop for example) but with the newer models on the market that won&apos;t be a problem.Hope this long winded ramble helps

What a pathetic excsue for a costume! The pants would not even be considered pajamas, let alone worn in public, and the elastic was barely stitched to the top with no waistband. The Sailor Hat was anything but. It has no structure, doesn&apos;t stand up and looks like a nitecap I guess to go along with the pajama bottoms! The Muscle Arms were flat, would not stay up on the arm and had to be stuffed to maintain any shape. The sleeves on the shirt were not long enough to cover the unfinished edge of the Muscle Arms We had to go out and buy a real Sailor hat and Corn Cob pipe which added another $15 to the cost of the costume, and my husband wore blue jeans and his own Navy sweater to keep the arms on. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!

The cheap price for this item reflects its quailty. Item comes in a plastic bag with Wireless Accessories and Made in China on the bag it doesn&apos;t even identify what company made this item. Shell consists of two parts that snap together. It fit my iPod 2nd Generation, but I didn&apos;t notice until I put my iPod Touch in that there was a chip in the case near the opening for the connector and a scratch on the shell. As several prior reviews stated, it is difficult to get the iPod out once put in. Luckily, using a thin screw driver I was able to pry the case off. Very poor quailty product, not worth the money you pay for it. I have since ordered to DLO hard shell case. I should have stuck with them as I have one of their hard shells for my 3rd generation iPod Nano. Don&apos;t fall for the cheap price.

Sorry, but this is definitely not in HD. Watch some gnienue HD toons to see the difference. This was obviously ripped from Cartoon Network due to the watermark on the screen. If you want to try this again, tune to your cable provider&apos;s Cartoon Network channel and try again.

I have discovered some new elneemts from your web site about pcs. Another thing I&apos;ve always presumed is that laptop computers have become a product that each residence must have for a lot of reasons. They supply you with convenient ways to organize the home, pay bills, search for information, study, hear music and perhaps watch shows. An innovative technique to complete these tasks is by using a notebook. These desktops are mobile ones, small, effective and portable.

there&apos;s a lot of tuners olinne that&apos;ll play a note, then you can match it by ear. the best way is to hit the note the same time it plays a note, and if you&apos;re close but hear beats (the little wah-oo-wah-oo-wah), however many you hear per second is how many hertz your note is away from the real note.if that sounds too much for you right now, you&apos;d want to download a program if you want to use your computer as a tuner. i know garage band (mac) can do it, but i don&apos;t know of any windows programs with that feature (a real shame, since macs suck)

Agree with everyone about saetfy. Re the cash issue, I would say when you enter the country, just to be safe with immigration, know exactly how long you will be there, have at least a3200 cash with you and be able to tell them how you will have access to money beyond that. They may not ask you anything, especially if it is a short trip, but in general immigration has been tightening up around here and they can get picky about details like that. Otherwise, depending on where you are, you&apos;ll probably need anywhere from a310 to a350 to get around, eat and do things. Museums are generally free in the UK, but transport can be pricey; Eurail passes are not valid in the UK (I think not in Ireland either), so you either need to get a BritRail pass or buy your train tickets in advance to get the best deals. Britain has the highest train fares in Europe, so if you don&apos;t buy in advance you could end up paying a lot of money for even short train journeys.

Cuba is a place that you should visit boefre the US lifts the embargo. Once that happens, you will see the fast food places pop up like crazy. A friend has just returned from a holiday in Cayo Coco, and said he had a great time there. I was in Varadero a year ago for my third visit, which was fantastic as usual, but will try Cayo Coco next time for a change of scenery.The Mayan Rivera is also a very nice holiday destination. We returned home on December 3rd after two wonderful weeks there. No kidnappings or murders happening. That is taking place about 1500 miles from there on the US, Mexican border. The Cancun area is a tourist mecca that can&apos;t afford to have bad publicity. The resorts have good security, and outside the resorts is a large police, and military presents. We toured outside the resort several times, and never ran into any trouble. The mexican people are very helpful, and pleasant. We will be returning there again this year for some more sun, and fun.The food in Cuba is not always what you are used to. Going 4 4 and a half star is kind of iffy. The booze, and entertainment are good.The Mayan Riviera, 4 4 and a half star is pretty good. Usually several restaurants to choose from. Lots of entertainment day and night. If you do the all inclusive you will have all the booze and food you can consume with no extra charge. I do recommend that you check with a travel agent for the best resorts for your budget.What ever you choose, I&apos;m sure you will enjoy.

I actually straetd a whole new MS right after I wrote and subbed my contest chapter in IS. But I didn&apos;t WANT to finish that MS, I knew by the time I&apos;d written a different one that the one I had entered into the contest wasn&apos;t very good. The chapter I entered in FtH was for a finished MS, and while I got a form R on that one, I think I would revise and submit that one. It&apos;s my opinion, and others could disagree with me, that if you believe in the story you should go ahead and submit it through traditional channels and see if you can get feedback. Two ladies in my crit group got the form R for this contest and I think if they sent it through traditional channels they would get more than that. I hope that helps. Thanks for stopping by!

Hello Der-shing Helmer, and thanks for the great read!On your point I must cfseons, that some mediocre web comics can be bearable because they update often and on time (say, *cough* Wayward Sons). But when YOU are actually capable of this kind of quality, you should rather worry about keeping that standard and really not about quantity at all.Anyway, I don&apos;t think you can shut up all the spoiled children and anonymous a-holes out there on the internets by way of responding to theme280a6 Even if you told off all of those reading now, later other idiots will join (bet on it) who won&apos;t have read this thread.The only long time solution is to stop wasting emotional energy, period. You are so very good at your own thing, and you should focus on that. Best of health going forward and cheers :-)

Yesterday, I watched Nova&apos;s piece on the memoiral. Today, I watched ACLJ&apos;s movie Forever Changed. I was. I&apos;ve been reading memoirals and memories from FB. In fact, I&apos;ve collected a few links to post on my blog, starting tomorrow, for the next four days, including writing out my own memories of the event. It&apos;s still as vivid as if it happened last week. Up to that point, I&apos;d lived a lot of my life on the surface, where it was safer. I never watched the news because I&apos;d been punished, repeatedly, for interrupting my mother&apos;s news watching. I didn&apos;t want to be like her. How odd it was to me, at the time, that I was the one who had the television on all the time, watching what happened. Needing to know as much as possible. Needing to feel connected to the rest of the world. I changed. It was only a few short months later that I saw Fellowship of the Ring , which was incredibly intense and opened a whole universe of emotions, coming out of shock, I suppose. I changed.

I totally urdnnstaed your frustrations, Martin I too bought one of the early Dension devices, loved it and hated it all at once. I still have it, but replaced my head unit with an Alpine system that has a direct iPod connection. It was fantastic by comparison, giving me total control over the iPod, showing track titles in the display and everything you would expect. However, I bought a new car, and am back to a factory fitted iPod interface which happens to be another Dension ICE&gt;Link d&apos;oh! I have got two of them now.The latest one works reasonably well, so I am not going to update firmware or anything. I have at least one iPod hat it works with, and whilst I don&apos;t get track names appearing (I can&apos;t believe that still isn&apos;t sorted) I do at least get control of the iPod through the head unit.Eventually I will get fed up with some aspect of it and search for an alternative. The trouble is, there are precious few choices available that can fit to the factory head unit. I then have to decide if it is worth while dismantling it all and starting again, and compromising on something else that currently works well.Never easy, eh?

The spaces beewten pages makes them seem almost like a gift, like something special that should be savored, and that&apos;s what this comic is.I studied the way you color and line your pages, as well as how you use facial expressions, and I have to say, it&apos;s helped me a great deal in my own artwork. The almost casual grace some of the characters seem to have is amazing, and how you translate each personality through their body language is just astounding.Thankyou so much for producing this wonderful work of art, and I will always check back for updates until the day it reaches it end. I will never leave The Meek. It is far too good.I appreciate all the work you do, dear.

Jennifer Mattern | lol I don&apos;t think that would work well in our case. I&apos;m a very methodical peackr. Everything is boxed and carefully labeled so boxes immediately go in the correct rooms when we move. My guy on the other hand is the type to get a few plastic bins, throw stuff in them, take them to the new house, dump them out somewhere, rinse, repeat. I think if I let him handle moving my things, I&apos;d be twice as stressed when I got home. We&apos;re also merging two households and introducing four kitties at the same time (that&apos;ll be fun). So I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have the heart to put too much of it on him. At least we&apos;re moving close enough that the bit by bit approach could work. And I have family and friends around, so I&apos;ll beg and plead to get help when I need it. One friend already agreed to help out for a day with the smaller moves. And I have two strong brothers who are great for helping with the big stuff on an official moving day. That&apos;s the plan at least. I try not to get too attached to plans though. As soon as you do that, they have a tendency not to work out. Let&apos;s just call it hopeful optimism.

That would be a big flaw in InDesign as well. Importing styles into InDesign isn&apos;t that big of a prolebm for me right now, but I only have 10 or so docs that use that style. Not a prolebm, but not worth the time either.Why not build the technology yourself and then market it?So the real question I have is whether or not MadCap&apos;s new product will have this feature. It shouldn&apos;t be that big of a deal to tie that kind of technology in.

You never get a boost, as credit score takes time to actamuluce, but the ideal number of credit cards is 3. If you have less than 3 the score goes down, if you have more than 3 the score may go down too. But if you already have more than three, do not close unused cards, just put them away. Since the length of time accounts established also matters, what also matters is your total debt/available credit ratio. So say you have 6 credit cards with total available credit of 35,000 and you have overall balance of 10,000 in 3 cards that is a little less than 33% of your available credit looks good. You close 3 unused cards, and your available credit goes down to 20,000, now your ratio is 50% this is a borderline. Over 50% is definitely bad!So, if you have 3 cards, do not open new ones, if you have 6 but using 2-3, just leave other cards alone, unless terms become a burden such as annual fees etc. Then close non-needed cards.

If Framemaker were a bit easier to cumtzsioe (e.g. with something like VB or even Perl instead of requiring you to do C development) some bit of functionality like this could probably be implemented easily enough I&apos;ve done a fair amount of FDK programming and this is sort of an interesting idea. My first thought was that you could add a variable or some other method of storing the path to the stylesheet/template in the document then wait for the FA_Note_PostOpenDoc event that opens the referenced template and imports formats from it. Actually this wouldn&apos;t be hard to do at all. With time (and a C compiler) all things are possible Alas, I doubt that I could get paid for doing this.

1. 介绍 传统信号或者图像采样多采取香农采样定理：即采样频率为信号频率最大值（那奎斯特采样频率）的二倍。本文提出一种新的信号处理思路——压缩采样（CS）。在这种新方法下，采样率会大大降低。压缩采样依赖两条原则：稀疏性和不相干性，前者从属于信号，后者从属于感测模式。稀疏性（sparsity）：表达的概念是连续时间信号的信息采集率可能要比按带宽选择的采集率小得多，或者说离散时间信号依赖的自由度数要比他的长度小的多，更明确的的说，压缩采样探索如下事实：许多自然信号在下述意义下是稀疏的或可压缩的：当用适当的基表示时，它们有更简洁的表达。不相干性（incoherence）：延伸了时间与频率之间的对偶性，它表达的概念是：正如时间域内的Dirac和尖峰信号在频率域内是展开的那样，具有以$latex {\Psi}&amp;fg;=000000$稀疏表示的对象，在获取它们的区域内一定是展开的。极为重要的是人们可以设计出有效的传感或采样方案，捕捉嵌入在稀疏信号内有用的信息内容，并将其压缩成少量数据。这些方法不是自适应的，且只需要与少量的与提供信号简洁表述之基不相干（否则将失去测量过程对信号的依赖性）的固定波形相关联；此外，有利用数值优化由采集的少量数据重构全长信号的方法。换言之，CS是一种非常简单有效的信息捕获方法，它以与信号无关的方式和低采样率采样，而后根据看似不完整的测量数据集用计算能力重构信号。2. 感知问题 对于信号$latex {f\left(x\right)}&amp;fg;=000000$，传感机制为：$latex \displaystyle y_{k}=\left\langle f,\varphi_{k}\right\rangle ,\qquad k=1,\ldots,m.\ \ \ \ \ (1)&amp;fg;=000000$也就是说我们只需要将要获得的对象与波形$latex {\varphi_{k}}&amp;fg;=000000$相关联，这是一个标准架构，例如，如果检测波形是Dirac delta（尖峰）函数，那么$latex {y}&amp;fg;=000000$就是$latex {f}&amp;fg;=000000$在时间或空间一个采样值的矢量；如果检测波形是像素的指示函数，那么$latex {y}&amp;fg;=000000$就是数字相机中传感器特别采集的图像数据；最后，如果检测波形是正弦函数，那么$latex {y}&amp;fg;=000000$就是Fourier系数，磁共振成像 (MRI)用的就是这种检测模态。尽管可以建立起时空连续的CS理论，但这里只关心离散信号$latex {f\in\mathbb{R}^{n}}&amp;fg;=000000$，原因有二，一是简单，二是现有理论在此情况下成熟得多。我们关心欠采样的情况，可得到的测量数$latex {m}&amp;fg;=000000$远小于信号$latex {f}&amp;fg;=000000$的维数$latex {n}&amp;fg;=000000$。由于各种原因，这种情形极为常见，譬如传感器数量有限，或者某些借助于中子散射获取图像的花费极为昂贵，或者是检测过程缓慢，象MRI那样只能对对象施行几次测量，等等。这些情况产生一些重要问题，根据$latex {m\ll n}&amp;fg;=000000$次测量能够准确的重构信号吗？能够设计出$latex {m\ll n}&amp;fg;=000000$个检测波形捕获到几乎所有的关于$latex {f}&amp;fg;=000000$的信息吗？以及如何根据这些信息逼近$latex {f}&amp;fg;=000000$？毫无疑问，这些都是困难的事情，因为可能需要解欠定线性方程组。令$latex {A}&amp;fg;=000000$是以$latex {\varphi_{1}^{*},\varphi_{2}^{*},\varphi_{3}^{*}, ,\varphi_{m}^{*}}&amp;fg;=000000$为行的$latex {m\times n}&amp;fg;=000000$测量矩阵，$latex {\varphi^{*}}&amp;fg;=000000$是$latex {\varphi}&amp;fg;=000000$的复转置。当$latex {m
