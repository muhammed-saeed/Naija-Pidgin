 omega11 May 9th, 2011, 04:22 PM I saw a McDonald&apos;s today with a separate self-serve fountain drinks. does that mean you can refill as many times as you want? if so then its hot!lol SpicYMchaggis May 9th, 2011, 04:23 PM Wow. MALific May 9th, 2011, 04:24 PM I second that. Wow. b1unt3d May 9th, 2011, 04:25 PM McDonald&apos;s has always had unlimited free refills for their fountain pop. dark_passenger May 9th, 2011, 04:28 PM A manager once refused to give me refills and i am still not sure whether they are free or not. ofdoom May 9th, 2011, 04:28 PM McDonald&apos;s has always had unlimited free refills for their fountain pop.

Its been that way for years... it would be nice if it was self serve as you often have to wait in line to get a refill. jhuynh May 9th, 2011, 04:29 PM McDonald&apos;s has always had unlimited free refills for their fountain pop.

McDonald&apos;s has always had unlimited free refills for their fountain pop.

Um... I don&apos;t know...
If it&apos;s always been free unlimited refills, then why would they have the options of medium, large, and extra large sizes? number8888 May 9th, 2011, 04:35 PM 9 posts and no one even metnioned the fact that this is IN THE WRONG FORUM! :facepalm: DealRacer May 9th, 2011, 04:37 PM Um... I don&apos;t know...

Hello!! cuz it&apos;s a fast food restaurant and probably half the ppl that buy there is for take out. Not everyone will be able to dine-in and take advantage of their free refills. :facepalm: chinaboy1021 May 9th, 2011, 04:59 PM Can&apos;t they order a small drink then pour it into their stomach for storage, then refill their cup before they leave for their car?? I don&apos;t kow how this would work with drive-thru though....dammn.. omega11 May 9th, 2011, 05:03 PM not to be harsh or anything, but the original poster is a ****** for even suggesting that this is a deal (apologies go to those who actually have a mental handicap).

managers can choose not to give refills if they are cheapa$$, buts its rare. 99% of fast food chains allow refills, cept for smaller places like Subway who limit them or charge u for a refill.

some managers even charge you for extra ketchup or sauce packets, which is totally lame!

Relax. People make mistakes. I do remember clicking the Food&amp;Drink tab for posting, but I might have mistaken.

By the way, I don&apos;t think it is self serve for drinks at all or even most locations right? Like it is only at some locations? idubbz May 9th, 2011, 05:12 PM i removed my initial post cause it was a bit harsh. i frankly didn&apos;t care its in the wrong thread. I just figured your &apos;realization&apos; was very sad.

Unlimited refills at fast food chains i assumed was general knowledge, but...i guess i should expect less out of ppl.

its like stating that you can take a penny from the penny tray at a corner store. that&apos;s essentially free profit as well....

anyway, ive dealt with stupid receptionists at a doctor&apos;s office who lose my files or can&apos;t fax so excuse my increased sensitivity. trky May 9th, 2011, 06:47 PM Flaming hot!!!! duckdown May 9th, 2011, 06:55 PM Always been free, just many locations do not have self serve cloneman May 9th, 2011, 06:56 PM When I was in high school (bout 8 years ago..) you could only get 1 refill (it wasn&apos;t self serve)

its not really a hot deal unless you&apos;re there for hours with your friends eating lots of food and always refilling.... nippleholic May 9th, 2011, 08:23 PM Can&apos;t they order a small drink then pour it into their stomach for storage, then refill their cup before they leave for their car??

:lol: omega11 May 9th, 2011, 09:00 PM lol. The reason why i was asking was because i don&apos;t eat at any of the fast foods but was a pepsi-holic. lol I learned a lot thankx guys! DiceMan May 9th, 2011, 10:36 PM Err, not to judge but how many of these drinks can a person really consume? I can&apos;t even finish one which is why I just get water. Also, something about the 20 tsp of sugar in reg coke turns me off. On the other hand, if eating at McDonlad&apos;s, I guess calories isn&apos;t a big concern anyway! Chuckled May 10th, 2011, 01:41 AM I know that you can get a free refill for coffee, but what about iced coffee, is that a free refill as well? joeyjoejoe May 10th, 2011, 09:31 AM I know that you can get a free refill for coffee, but what about iced coffee, is that a free refill as well?

I&apos;ve seen people get it. Personally, I don&apos;t see why they wouldn&apos;t... seeing that it&apos;s the same as a regular coffee, but with ice.

And a boost of chemical flavoring! wszeto28 May 10th, 2011, 10:53 AM I&apos;ve seen a few Mcdonalds limit your refills to one before. Waht they do is either get a one hole punch and punch the bottom of the cup or they grab a permanent parker and mark the bottom. shopzors May 10th, 2011, 11:16 AM Err, not to judge but how many of these drinks can a person really consume?

i guess they want people drinking from the bottom of the cups now? :confused: New Tradition May 10th, 2011, 02:00 PM Actually for me, the one time I asked for a free refill at a McDonalds, they told me I can only get one, that&apos;s it. Maybe it was the specific location...

Although that&apos;s fine. I can&apos;t down two medium drinks in one sitting. Just have one, and nurse the second one when we leave, that&apos;s it xD TotallyKiller May 11th, 2011, 02:22 PM I&apos;ve also heard it limited to one. Actually, it&apos;s posted as only one in the McD&apos;s near me. I&apos;ve also been told by the manager that he has to limit things like that otherwise he gets too many people taking cups from their garbage and coming up for a refill. Sad but true. He&apos;s a nice enough guy to just fill them once and let them get away with it, but has to then impose restrictions on all.

Really, anything past one is excessive anyway. I&apos;d personally be embarrassed to be seen going up more than once. slowtyper May 11th, 2011, 02:25 PM This really doesn&apos;t help anyone outside of high school when kids like to hang out at mcdonalds. I mean does any adult actually hang out at mcdonalds to talk to friends? You go and get takeout or eat and leave! Chuckled May 11th, 2011, 02:28 PM I&apos;ve also heard it limited to one.

Anyone who is willing to fish a cup out a garbage and use it again, deserves a drink on the house. slowtyper May 11th, 2011, 02:32 PM Anyone who is willing to fish a cup out a garbage and use it again, deserves a drink on the house.
I think that is just an excuse which sounds better than&quot;I don&apos;t want loud teenagers taking up 3 tables and collectively spending 20 bucks over 2 hours. TotallyKiller May 11th, 2011, 02:33 PM Anyone who is willing to fish a cup out a garbage and use it again, deserves a drink on the house.

You&apos;d think so, but no. Not when you&apos;re sitting near the garbage and witness the whole thing. And not subtle either. Like 3-4 people pulling the garbage can out and fishing out a few cups, pouring out the dregs and heading to the counter leaving everything out. On a daily basis. While he&apos;s a nice guy, he&apos;s only doing it to prevent a scene, not because they deserve it. It&apos;s the manager who deserves a drink. I&apos;d be McBoozin if I had his job. new_vr May 11th, 2011, 02:38 PM McDonald&apos;s has always had unlimited free refills for their fountain pop.

Not always free. When I was young they didn&apos;t have free refills. Then taco bell came along with the free refills and McDonalds changed to compete. Chuckled May 11th, 2011, 02:47 PM I think that is just an excuse which sounds better than&quot;I don&apos;t want loud teenagers taking up 3 tables and collectively spending 20 bucks over 2 hours.

I was being sarcastic. I think it&apos;s a nice gesture on the part of the owner/manager to give them a free drink. Asking them to leave would probably provoke them into making more trouble than they are by fishing a cup out of the garbage and asking for a free beverage. The only remedy I can see to this situation, though it does not altogether prevent it from happening, is to ensure the garbage is inaccessible.

Definitely don&apos;t deserve it, but best leave them alone or risk confrontation. Not worth it, like you said, to make a scene. TotallyKiller May 11th, 2011, 03:12 PM Just to clarify, I never said it was teenagers. That&apos;s a separate problem he&apos;s got. I&apos;ll avoid using any descriptions or stereotypes so let&apos;s just go with &apos;homeless&apos;. joeyjoejoe May 11th, 2011, 03:47 PM Just kick them out of the store! If you give hands outs like that, they&apos;ll always come back. That manager isn&apos;t being a nice guy, he&apos;s just a wimp and needs to grow a pair.

If I was that manager&apos;s boss, I would fire him. If he can&apos;t handle a simple task like a bum trying to mooch off your restaurant, then how can I trust this guy to handle unrully customers? Give them free Big Macs? What about bad employees? Upsize their fries for free?

I&apos;m not saying litterally kick the bum out. But talk to the bum calmy, but sternly to leave. If the bum wants to be difficult, then threaten to call the cops... If the bum escalates further then call the cops. Chuckled May 11th, 2011, 03:57 PM I&apos;m not saying litterally kick the bum out. But talk to the bum calmy, but sternly to leave.

:lol: dragon_drift May 11th, 2011, 04:01 PM I think it really depends on which store it is. There are times where they mark the bottom of your cup to limit your refill and some stores don&apos;t. The limit has to be done to prevent abusers I guess. Think of it like this: Someone buys a drink now, keeps the cup and comes back tomorrow for a refill, and repeating the process. Sklem211 May 11th, 2011, 04:38 PM I work there and I can tell you that McDonald&apos;s do give refills but any store reserves the right to refuse a refill for any reason. Many stores will limit the refills to one and mark your cup so a group of teenagers cant order one small pop and keep getting refills to share amongst them for hours. Others stores likes ones in food courts will ask you to bring your receipt up with you when you get you refill so they know you didn&apos;t get to the a mall 10am and buy a drink, shop all day, then get a refill when you leave at 4pm. Some people just ruin it for the rest of us. There are no refills in the drive thru and it only applies to coffee/soft drinks/hot water for tea. I&apos;ve had many MANY people wash their cups out and bring them in the next day, pick cups out of garbages, ask other customers if they can have theirs when they&apos;re done. It&apos;s really sad but some people will do some crazy **** to save a buck! This same refill policies apply during the $1 drink promotion as well :) TotallyKiller May 11th, 2011, 05:07 PM Just kick them out of the store!

Easy to say without seeing it. Trust me, he&apos;s doing what he can to keep things going smoothly. I&apos;ve seen what happens when they try what you said, and it&apos;s not good. His tactics are the result of years of experience in this particular location. The man deserves a promotion and a transfer, not termination. He deals with it in a calm manner that allows him to get the massive lunch crowd through and it costs the company pennies. The fact that he just keeps smiling and knows most people&apos;s names through all that makes me wish that there were more employees like him. If the man could do IT Audit, I&apos;d hire him in a second. Resourceful quick-thinkers are a rare breed. joeyjoejoe May 11th, 2011, 05:25 PM Easy to say without seeing it.

its not really a hot deal unless you&apos;re there for hours with your friends eating lots of food and always refilling....

that&apos;s what i used to do in HS. buy lunch, eat there and finish my pop and go for a refill before heading back to class :lol: billdozer May 11th, 2011, 10:28 PM Can&apos;t they order a small drink then pour it into their stomach for storage, then refill their cup before they leave for their car??

Literally loling at this. :lol: OpportunityChaos May 11th, 2011, 11:46 PM Um... I don&apos;t know...
If it&apos;s always been free unlimited refills, then why would they have the options of medium, large, and extra large sizes?

because there are take out orders and sometimes little kids can&apos;t drink a large coke so they get a child size or small sized cup. :facepalm: biee May 12th, 2011, 12:33 AM Actually, before when I was in the states, they didn&apos;t let me refill when I had a small cup. They only let me refill medium cup or higher...

And is refilling for orange juice possible? :confused: Chuckled May 12th, 2011, 02:04 AM And is refilling for orange juice possible? :confused:

No. And since when did they start serving orange juice outside of the sealed containers? joeyjoejoe May 12th, 2011, 10:16 AM No. And since when did they start serving orange juice outside of the sealed containers?

Quite a while ago. I used to get one every morning over 10 years ago, so at least that long ago. I&apos;d get a large (medium fountain cup) orange juice and it came up to nearly $2. It was cheaper than getting juice in the bottles as they were usually over $2. Of course this was pricing 10 years ago... no clue now. ippon May 12th, 2011, 10:49 AM Quite a while ago.

i think it also depends on the location.
at the location near me, they have OJ from dispenser behind the counter, and apple juice is still in the sealed container, but they just got that dispenser a couple of months ago.

Thanks! I wasn&apos;t aware of this. I&apos;ll take orange juice over soda any day, even if it&apos;s from concentrate. Yeah it&apos;s cheaper than orange juice in the bottle, that&apos;s for sure, and it&apos;s from concentrate as well. TotallyKiller May 12th, 2011, 12:19 PM That&apos;s not quick thinking... that&apos;s cowering.

You&apos;re right. They should get the cops involved. Every day. Cause that&apos;s good business instead of giving them 10cents of free pop and having them out, quietly, without incident, and then moving on to the rest of the paying customers.

I&apos;m guessing you&apos;ve never been in a management position in anything that deals directly with customers. It&apos;s called &apos;picking your battles&apos;, which is a very important quality. There&apos;s a reason you hire the guy who knows when to say when, and fire the guy who needs to make something big out of nothing. You might as well suggest that employees should fight the robber while being held up instead of just giving the cash up.

Besides, I never said they were threatening. They are simply annoying. And cops have better things to do than stop in daily to deal with something that could have been dealt with better. joeyjoejoe May 12th, 2011, 04:18 PM You&apos;re right.

If you check my previous posts, I&apos;ve mentioned in the past that I owned and managed 2 successful restaurants. Both restaruants were sold for much more than what I bought them for. So yeah, I know what I&apos;m talking about.

If you set expectations of getting away with scamming, then they will come back every day expecting that same level of service. If you nip it in the butt right away, then chances are it won&apos;t escalate and they won&apos;t come back. Whether they are threatening or not is beside the point.

I&apos;m not saying rant and rave if somebody tries to scam you, all I&apos;m saying is to say no. Why is that so hard?

Also I mentioned ONLY to call the cops if it does escalate. A restaurant is private property and if you cause a scene, then yes I&apos;m within my right to call the cops and have them arrest you.

I&apos;m saying that your restaurant experience and fast food (based on the way people are served, the process for getting it to them, the physical environment of the establishment, what people expect, reputation of the establishment, etc) are apples and oranges for dealing with these situations. I&apos;ve worked in and managed several restaurants and bars and from talking to this guy and witnessing what he had to deal with, I&apos;m flat out telling you that he did what he needed to do, in that situation, in that particular location, to make the situation work as well as it could with the least impact to the current clientele and their revenue. Which is all I&apos;ve been saying all along. I&apos;ve never said that you were wrong in your approach, just that it&apos;s not right for the situation I&apos;m talking about.

So unless you know the guy, and have been there, I&apos;m saying that no, you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. However, I&apos;ll defer to your expertise the next time we&apos;re talking about one of the restaurants that you owned and sold (for a profit) under your iron-fisted regime. shannn May 12th, 2011, 08:37 PM Unlimited coffee refills are great for studying late at night :D ippon May 12th, 2011, 09:05 PM Unlimited coffee refills are great for studying late at night :D

at the location i frequent, the staff actually comes out to provide refills to customers with the pot.
never expected that kind of service at mcd&apos;s.
people vilify mcd&apos;s all the time, but i like what i get for the few limited things i get from there. jason9945 May 12th, 2011, 09:08 PM Can I return my unused refill for a refund? joeyjoejoe May 13th, 2011, 09:37 AM I&apos;m saying that your restaurant experience and fast food (based on the way people are served, the process for getting it to them, the physical environment of the establishment, what people expect, reputation of the establishment, etc) are apples and oranges for dealing with these situations.

Saying no I will not be scammed is an&quot;iron-fisted regime&quot;... right. :facepalm:

I never mentioned what restaurant I did own, so your entire post is completely invalid... how do you know it wasn&apos;t a McDonalds?

You still fail to mention exactly what happened where being allowed to be scammed was the proper protocol. Don&apos;t bother trying to think up the perfect scenario either as I just don&apos;t care anymore. duckdown May 13th, 2011, 10:57 AM This thread is SO&quot;RFD&quot; TotallyKiller May 13th, 2011, 11:29 AM at the location i frequent, the staff actually comes out to provide refills to customers with the pot.

I had that a couple of times when I was in Montreal. Totally caught me by surprise. Was a nice change of pace though. TotallyKiller May 13th, 2011, 11:47 AM Saying no I will not be scammed is an&quot;iron-fisted regime&quot;... right. :facepalm:

I&apos;m pretty sure I explained the situation clear enough. And pretty sure it was you who was telling me (and he) exactly what was right and wrong (and not subtly) with, as you said, not much info. Kinds makes you look like an ignorant jerk.

And if it was a McD&apos;s that you sold, then the fact you sold it for a profit means nothing. You could buy and sell a McD&apos;s without ever setting foot in it or having anything to do with how it&apos;s managed. Something I&apos;m sure you already know.

I don&apos;t need the perfect scenario. Nor was I &apos;thinking up&apos; anything. I was describing exactly what the situation is here and haven&apos;t changed or modified the story or my position on it. I know what the situation is here, (through direct experience and observation) and that&apos;s good enough. If you feel that you have it nailed down, and that your way is going to work for everyone in every case (which is exactly what you are trying to tell me here by claiming that you know what should be done even though you have no direct knowledge of the place) then you should be a published consultant who helps restaurants establish and thrive. I know people who do this and they make huge dough. That way you can be an arrogant know-it-all and get paid for it. Maybe even get your own HGTV or Food Network show.

And you care. C&apos;mon admit it. I can tell by the &apos;facepalm&apos; smiley that you used. maniackjr May 13th, 2011, 09:44 PM Aside from free drinks, I think you can also ask them to fill cups of ice which can be used for a fishing day. nagasadow May 17th, 2011, 01:01 AM Wooot $1 pop and unlimited refills Its like being jewish and scottish at the same time :cheesygri Chuckled May 17th, 2011, 01:28 AM Wooot $1 pop and unlimited refills Its like being jewish and scottish at the same time :cheesygri

:facepalm: Totoriko Jul 8th, 2011, 08:01 PM Friend of mine was refused a refill (Coke) today. The manager told him that he was seen entering the premises with the cup.
So you can&apos;t leave the McDonalds and come back in with a cup for a refill even for 5 mins.

Also I was told that there is no refill for the iced coffee the other day.
I think it&apos;s store dependent whether they allow for refills or not. Scott84 Jul 9th, 2011, 08:36 AM Friend of mine was refused a refill (Coke) today. The manager told him that he was seen entering the premises with the cup.

It&apos;s free re-fills while you are inside. Almost every location I have been to acts only this way. baz5 Jul 9th, 2011, 01:55 PM Friend of mine was refused a refill (Coke) today. The manager told him that he was seen entering the premises with the cup.

You joined to discuss refills at mcdonalds? baz5 Jul 9th, 2011, 10:42 PM You joined to discuss refills at mcdonalds?

lol.
,. westernmetaphor Jul 10th, 2011, 12:16 AM Can I still say wow? lol NKode Jul 10th, 2011, 10:15 AM Forget free refills, how about a free drink.

It was kinda weird, and sorry, in a way. I was at the McD&apos;s near Wonderland, and the place was full of skinny, out of school kids. I finish getting my order, place my food down, and goto the self serve drink station. I get there to see 2-3 kids using the ketchup cups as soda cups and getting their drink-on as such. What was funny more was when one kid refers to his drink as a coke shot.....Sad. aplayaz2000 Jul 10th, 2011, 10:01 PM who would want to drink more than a large cup of soda anyways

if you thought that was sad, you really need to search for better things to feel sad about. they&apos;re kids. being kids.

i usually go through at least 3-4 large refills during a single meal. wolverine07 Jul 10th, 2011, 10:23 PM The Mcdonald&apos;s I go to are pretty cool, I usually frequent 2 locations, 1 near work and 1 near home. One time I forgot my wallet and was in the drive thru already and I told the young manager I only had enough change for a double cheesburger, he asked me what type of drink would I like with the burger and I said I only had enough for the burger, he told me no probs, it was free. I thought to myself what a cool Org! BTW I have never had problems refilling my drink, though I don&apos;t do this often, not a big fan of fountain pop, the syrup + CO2 are rarely calibrated correctly. slowtyper Jul 10th, 2011, 10:54 PM , not a big fan of fountain pop, the syrup + CO2 are rarely calibrated correctly.

oh man I put fountain pop at the very top! Especially mcD&apos;s (at least when I was younger and had drank it more often). McD&apos;s fountain pop&gt;glass bottles&gt;cans&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plastic bottles Kherani Jul 10th, 2011, 11:16 PM McDonalds on Kipling and Dixon always refuses refills on the dollar drink. DeathRazR Jul 10th, 2011, 11:25 PM i refill my $1 drink cup atleast 4-5 times before i throw it out, or when the bottom starts to rip. wolverine07 Jul 10th, 2011, 11:27 PM oh man I put fountain pop at the very top! Especially mcD&apos;s (at least when I was younger and had drank it more often). McD&apos;s fountain pop&gt;glass bottles&gt;cans&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plastic bottles

When I used to work in a bar, I hated those fountain pop machines. I used to have to change the syrup tanks and they used to stick the the hose, then we would alway run out of CO2 and I would have to change the tank also. Maybe this is why I hate fountain pop! :D baz5 Jul 11th, 2011, 12:52 AM oh man I put fountain pop at the very top! Especially mcD&apos;s (at least when I was younger and had drank it more often).

Me too, I don&apos;t know what it is, but I find it really good. Though I&apos;m still a big fan of cans. aplayaz2000 Jul 11th, 2011, 01:11 AM i usually go through at least 3-4 large refills during a single meal.you are healthy and fit right? baz5 Jul 11th, 2011, 02:39 AM Wow, that&apos;s a lot.
That&apos;s 300g+ of sugar = 1200 calories on the drink alone. And if it&apos;s diet I&apos;m sure that much isn&apos;t good for you either. slowtyper Jul 11th, 2011, 02:45 AM you are healthy and fit right? Well he didn&apos;t actually say it was only him drinking it. Cheap guy is probably sharing one drink with 3 korean grandmothers ippon Jul 11th, 2011, 09:18 AM you are healthy and fit right?

not really. haven&apos;t worked out in almost a year.
i drink coke zero. i&apos;m after the caffeine. ippon Jul 11th, 2011, 09:19 AM Well he didn&apos;t actually say it was only him drinking it. Cheap guy is probably sharing one drink with 3 korean grandmothers

it all me, brah. no sharing with the grannies!
although, the location i go to becomes a pure korean town on certain days. wolverine07 Jul 11th, 2011, 09:58 AM Me too, I don&apos;t know what it is, but I find it really good. Though I&apos;m still a big fan of cans.

It&apos;s cans for me, taste better and the CO2 is always right. The only bottle I like is when I buy Snapple, Snapple can has a funny taste. Reyshel01 Jul 12th, 2011, 10:34 AM Wow.

+1 Reyshel01 Jul 12th, 2011, 10:35 AM have you ever been to a McDonalds before today?

I think he&apos;s some kind of a caveman lol 501 Jul 12th, 2011, 10:53 AM i&apos;ve been refused refills, i think its the location i goto...
