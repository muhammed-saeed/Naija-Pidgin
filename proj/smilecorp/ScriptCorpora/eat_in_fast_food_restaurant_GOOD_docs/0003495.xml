Description
 The food at Five Guys has been praised far and wide stalking numerous awards and prizes all the same. This Chinatown outlet is one of seven in DC alone, such is the roaring success of their scarce offerings. Burgers, fries and hot-dogs dominate their menu with free refills of Coke coming at a premium. For a humble price, the quantities are very generous with large meals satisfying upto 3 persons. Bacon burgers and Cajun fries are considered definite bargains. The Chinatown outlet is priced a tad more for its increased demand.   No Photos Available Image Search» See all Washington Restaurants»   Map   Add to Trip     Loading...

Contributor , 7/19/10 I am in LA right now, and I keep telling all these dumb californians how much better five guys is than In-N-Out. They have never even heard of it. Shame on them, its the best fast food burger out there. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo!

Contributor , 2/21/10 bags of potatoes surround you (to make french fries), peanuts on the table. It is a burger place and for fast food&quot; it is above average Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/21/10 For a fast food restaurant, burgers here are a thing of beauty. Juicy, flavorful and freshly made. If you love fries, your in for a delightful surprise, a regular order easily serves two with leftovers. Eating in is your best option as food does not travel well. The fries wilt, the burger and bun shrink. The atmosphere is bare bones but who&apos;s looking at the walls? Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/21/10 Best grilled hamburgers with every imaginable fixin or extra in the area. Freshly made french fries. Was this review helpful?

( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/20/10 How can you go wrong when you can get a good burger with all the free toppings you want? You can&apos;t, but the colossal french fires are even better than the burgers. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/20/10 Fabulous burgers made to order. Place isn&apos;t fancy and don&apos;t expect much in the way of service...but you will enjoy the burgers. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By A Yahoo! Contributor , 2/20/10 Great burgers cooked any way you want it with endless choices for toppings. They have the best fries - fresh and always hot. They give you a generous portion of fries served in a brown bag. Half of the fries always disappear before my husband gets home with them!
