 acknowledge them when they come in
get them seated asap
ask them about drinks and starters right away don&apos;t make them wait
give them the specials don&apos;t make them ask
suggestions if they&apos;re not sure what they want
the person who takes the order needs to be the one to bring out the order
that same person needs to check back after a couple of minutes
Act like you care and not like you have 8 other tables to take care of
smile show some teeth please
talk to the whole table not just the man.

Wait 3-5 minutes- discreetly somewhere- not hovering
Ask if everything is O.K.&gt;&gt;specifically if the steak is cooked alright
Let them enjoy their meal. Look for eye contact, don&apos;t make them snap their fingers at you if they need something
Clear dinner, offer dessert, coffee
Clear dessert.
Ask if there&apos;s anything else, present check.

 personally when I go in to a restaurant I like the place to be clean, staff to be nice, drink cup refilled, if something has gone wrong take ownership of the problem and solve the problem quickly if something arises, invite me to come back
