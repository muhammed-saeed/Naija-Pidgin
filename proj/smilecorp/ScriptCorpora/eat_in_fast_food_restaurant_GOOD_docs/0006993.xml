 Views:    Font: [ Large Medium Small ] 
 Here are some friends with simlar question as we.And I have this question for many days,anyone help us?
Kitty said: Yes. KFC stole my money and won&apos;t give it back? -I try seach this on internet but no results found.Maybe this is a stupid question.
Mike said: oh,no,you are wrong.I have found as below for this question( KFC stole my money and won&apos;t give it back? ),it will help you,my kids.
 I went to KFc%26#039;s drive thru last week and the dumb people at the drive thru swiped my card a bunch of times because they couldn%26#039;t figure out how it worked. I ended up getting charged twice, i got two receipts at the time but didn%26#039;t even look at them, so now my bank shows they charged twice. $6.36 and then $6.35.. I called KFC, asked to speak with a manager and i was on hold for 5 minutes and i heard in the background %26quot; i don%26#039;t know she wants to speaks to a manager%26quot; anyways, i spoke to the so called manager and he said they can only give me food and not my money back... Well i don%26#039;t want food, because my chicken was pink last time, and it tasted horrible. it even made me sick, at the time i figured whatever, i%26#039;ll just never go back again but now i%26#039;m pissed because they won%26#039;t give good service, no good food, and they won%26#039;t give me my money back. What can i do? I know it%26#039;s not alot of money, but they can%26#039;t get away with this. Please help! answer from chineseop.com cooking QA Call the KFC corporate 1800 number and talk to a customer service representative. They will be able to help you (and they%26#039;ll probably discipline the manager at that store). Even if you don%26#039;t get your money back, you%26#039;ll still get them in trouble for giving you a hard time. If this doesn%26#039;t work, file a complaint with the BBB (better business bureau) and they%26#039;ll start arbitration proceedings (which you%26#039;ll most likely win). Good luck! answer from chineseop.com cooking QA was it a credit card or debt? If it was a credit card you can call and dispute it and the bank will usually just remove the charge as it is more trouble for them to dispute it with KFC than it is worth. Better the bank get hit for 6 bucks than you. Not sure if it would be the same with a debit card, but you can dispute the charges on debit cards as well. answer from chineseop.com cooking QA I would do two things:

1) Call the credit card company and dispute the charges. They will almost certainly get you your money back.

2) Write to corporate. Give them the store number (on the receipt) and explain what happened. I believe, at the very least, they should give you coupons/credits for your troubles (KFC%26#039;s parent company [Yum! Brands] also owns some other resturants, such as Taco Bell and Pizza Hut). answer from chineseop.com cooking QA actually the mashed potatoes and biscuits aren%26#039;t that bad. they were probably illegals who took your order! you could do a bunch of things, but first try showing them the receipt, if not call, or go on their website, and then file a formal complaint. maybe you shouldn%26#039;t have fast food then, or ever go to KFC! pink chicken is NASTY, become a vegetarian :). that should help. GOOD LUCK answer from chineseop.com cooking QA Call 1-800-callkfc. That is their corporate customer satisfaction line. This should get results. At least it does at my hubbys KFC. The owner of that store gets these complaints or compliments and will pass them down to the store. Corporate also sees them and that looks bad for the owners if it is a complaint. or you can email them it will get the same results.
Here%26#039;s the link...

http://www.kfc.com/contact/ answer from chineseop.com cooking QA Go INTO the store and tell the manager what happened. Someone tried to get the $6 and keep it. Bring in both reciptes and show the boss. If that doesn%26#039;t work, go to the KFC web page and complain that the chicken was pink, the employees were rude and they double swiped your card.

I have. answer from chineseop.com cooking QA Go in with a letter for the manager explaining what happened, and a copy of your bank statement showing the two charges ( blank out any other information). Ask to see the manager, and insist that he deal with it right there. Im quite sure you%26#039;ll get your refund. answer from chineseop.com cooking QA mcdonalds did the same thing to us, and you are right, it isnt a lot of money, but if it happened to you, it happens to other folks,
contact you attorney general and file a formal complaint, and dont go back to that restaurant, cuz they will more than likely poison or spit or who knows what else to your food answer from chineseop.com cooking QA You need to call corporate and let them know that you tried to resolve the problem at the location and got nowhere. Next dispute the charge. You WILL get a refund one way or the other. answer from chineseop.com cooking QA Contact the corporate office. Go straight to the top, a CEO or someone like that. They hate getting complaints and will do what they can to satisfy you.
