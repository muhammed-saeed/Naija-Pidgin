The Best Way to Recycle Fast Food Waste

The best ways to recycle fast food wastes are composting and recycling. The typical fast food restaurant produces around 275 pounds of trash daily. This can be reduced considerably by composting and recycling.

There is also a difference in fast food waste and sit-down restaurant waste. The fast food restaurant uses much more nonrecyclable paper and plastic in the form of paper cups, paper plates, paper napkins, and paper packaging. There is less food waste than the sit-down restaurant but enough to be concerned with recycling or composting.
 
How can fast food places reduce their food and paper wastes before composting and recycling? Here are some ways:

1) Use biodegradable cups, utensils, and paper.
2) Use cups made of cornstarch rather than styrofoam. Never use styrofoam. There is new technology every day coming up with new ways of making biodegradable products.
3) Edible food can be sent to food banks and shelters. I believe most fast food places already do this.
4) Non-edible food waste can be sent to pig farms. This method has been around a long time. (I know this because I went to my first college in 1960 where there were two containers - one for food waste and one for paper and other waste. The food waste was sold to pig farmers).
5) Use refillable condiment dispensers rather than individual condiment packages.
6) Use bulk drinking straws in covered containers rather than paper wrapped.
7) Employees should wear reusable hats.
8) There can be reusable serveware for employees
9) Reduce the price of beverage if you bring your own mug.
(www.p2pays.org/ref%5C03/02283/), (http://abcnews.go.com?Business/TenWays/story?id=382 8728).

All fast food restaurants should have separate bins for food waste and paper waste, depending on how it is recycled. Food and paper waste can go together for composting.

Whatever is left over in fast food paper and food waste after all methods used above should then be sent out for composting. There should be a considerable reduction in food and plastic waste if all steps are followed. Actually 275 lbs. of trash per day should be reduced to 15 lbs per day according to an article at (http://abcnews.go.com/Business/TenWays/story?id=382 8728). A few restaurants have experimented with and implemented all of the above recommendations, which have greatly reduced fast food trash output.

Make sure to do your part in fast food recycling by throwing your fast food trash in recyclable containers whereever available. If there are none in the fast food restaurants you go to you can always alert them to the possibilities.
