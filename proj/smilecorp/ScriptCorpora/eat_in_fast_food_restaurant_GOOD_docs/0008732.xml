Wendi C. Thomas: Roland’s words tarnish officials
 
 By Wendi C. Thomas Memphis Commercial Appeal Posted September 25, 2011 at midnight 

 Discuss Print A A A 
 

 
Warning: The following quote from Shelby County Commissioner Terry Roland is not for those with weak stomachs.

At a Sept. 12 press conference to complain that the commission’s appointment of seven members to a unified school board was tainted, Roland said this of his critics: “They can all kiss me on my entire rear end because I’m doing what the people of my district wants me to do.”

Once you’ve scrubbed that nauseating image from your head, note that the best way this grown man found to vent was to publicly encourage amorous attention to his nether regions.

As you might imagine, this didn’t sit well with lots of folks, including fellow Republican Robert Hutton, who e-mailed Roland Tuesday.

“I am deeply troubled by what I have read in the news with respect to your vulgar public comments concerning kissing your rear-end,” Hutton wrote.

“Most people in Shelby County expect their representatives to act with civility and dignity. You can vehemently disagree with a person’s position, but not lower yourself to vulgarity that I would be ashamed to be heard by my children.”

Roland’s response was consistent with his terse ’tude:

I am sorry you feel this way, but dealing with idiodst you have to take drastic measures,besides since you live in Memphis and not in my district,you oppion falls on deaf ears.

For a moment, sit with the irony: An elected official who claims to be so deeply concerned about education misspelled “idiots” and has a wanton disregard for spelling and punctuation.

Roland’s typos make Hutton chuckle, but they’re not his chief concern.

It’s not even Roland’s politics with which Hutton has qualms. He has agreed with much of what the Millington commissioner supports, although Hutton is for school consolidation and Roland is not.

Hutton can even set aside the fact that as chairman of the commission’s legislative committee and vice-chairman of two other committees, certainly Roland must contemplate what’s best for the entire county, not just those who vote in his district.

No, it’s the tone, the choice of words, the bravado with which Roland spoke and the inexplicable silence of other county commissioners.

“One thing that has bothered me lately is just the increasing degradation of discourse, particularly people in government being able to act in a dignified manner,” said Hutton, who is a lawyer and lives in East Memphis.

“Elected officials should be held to a higher standard.”

Lest you think Roland was simply having a bad day, to which we are all entitled, Roland rarely plays well with others.

In the last two months, he’s stormed out of a commission meeting, verbally battered candidates for a unified board, committed to revealing all the details of closed-door commission-attorney meetings, bragged that he’d do his best to sabotage the schools merger and threatened to beat up a commissioner with whom he’s disagreed.

This, sadly, is what voters accept of those they chose to govern. The name-calling, the polarization, the demonization of those who think and vote differently, the inability to consider another person’s perspective — none of it bodes well for our country’s future.

“The manner of communication has become so vulgar that it makes a mockery of the institution and that promotes a lack of respect for government,” Hutton told me by phone Friday, after other commissioners suggested he forward Roland’s e-mail to the media.

Hutton’s disappointment extends to other commissioners, 11 of whom were copied on his e-mail to Roland.

“Frankly, I am also disappointed with your fellow commissioners for not publicly sanctioning you for behavior,” he wrote.

Hutton doesn’t have to look far to find models of better behavior — Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis Mayor A C Wharton.

“I admire them and I voted for both of them,” Hutton said. “They hold themselves out in a way that promotes respect for government. Now compare that to Terry Roland.”

It’s not a pleasant comparison, but I don’t expect Roland to temper his demeanor.

Instead, I’m worried about what he’ll invite us to kiss next.

Ms. Thomas is correct--civility in politics is becoming the exception, not the rule.

With that said, I don&apos;t recall Ms. Thomas calling out California Democrat Maxine Waters when she made the comment that the TEA Party&quot;can go straight to hell&quot;.

Oh my, would you have a look at that? GOP mud wrestling in the CA between two nominal RINOs. This must be a ramp up to an election year.

Can this be the same Robert Hutton who isn&apos;t at all offended trying to get child murderers and rapists off? Or are there two of them running around?

Refresh my memory. Robert Glen Coe. Child abductor. Child rapist. Child murderer.

The day before his execution, the CA carried a story explaining that Robert Hutton was asking for his client&apos;s life to be spared because he was certifiably nuts. The day after Coe&apos;s execution, the CA carried a half page editorial from Robert Hutton explaining what a great guy Coe was, and how articulate he was. No mention at all about the crap presented to the courts.

I think the record at least raises some questions about how objective Robert Hutton is. I&apos;m pretty sure as a judge of character he&apos;s really not in much of a position to give Terry Roland any grief. At least Roland never tried to get a child rapist, kidnapper or murderer off.

I am a conservative Republican, but on this one Wendy is right on the money. Roland is an embarrassment. He acts like a child trying to be a bully, and seems to show contempt for basic grammar and education in general. I love a good southern accent, but he sounds like a hick. His blow hard ways go all the way back to when his kids were in little league, and that was years ago. He couldn&apos;t keep his mouth shut then and won&apos;t now. What he doesn&apos;t understand is that a person can hold and defend almost any position without sounding like an uneducated bimbo.

I&apos;ll say one thing for you, Mr. Publicenemy: you definitely gave yourself the right username.

Since I assume, from your letter, that you&apos;re one of those blood-thirsty, vengeful supporters of capital punishment, know this: without capable lawyers like Mr. Hutton to take on the representation of those accused of capital murder, the executions you crave could never take place because, like it or not, the LAW requires that someone charged with a capital crime must be represented by competent counsel. Many death sentences have been overturned because of the incompetence of defense counsel, and i&apos;m sure someone like you hates it when that happens.

His job isn&apos;t to get murderers&quot;off&quot;; his job is to assure that someone in jeopardy of being murdered by the state gets a fair trial. If you have a problem with that, maybe you should go live in one of the few countries that still execute convicted murderers, but do so after sham trials.

You should be thankful Hutton exists, rather than vilifying him for doing a job our constitution REQUIRES.

People like you make me sick.

Roland serves the same function for white folks as Janis Fullilove does for black folks: each race needs its own idiots.

How shockingly vulgar -- making references to... his REAR END! The horror!

I&apos;m so appalled that anyone in gentile Shelby County could ever imagine such a profane urban lingual construct!

We may have to pass a NEW LAW to preempt a stampede of rampant, unprecedented, antisocial, likely racist/sexist/homophobic offensive language -- we&apos;ll usher in a&quot;new era of civility&quot;. Like in Wisconsin! Like after the Arizona shooting!

Nobody in Shelby County has ever been subjected to such crass assaults on tender ears before!

Oh wait....unless of course you are a student here. In which case you&apos;ve heard (and maybe become proficient with) every possible combination/permutation of the f-word and familial references by the end of the first grade.

Or you&apos;ve ever stood in line at a fast food restaurant here.

Or strolled through any mall here.

Or listened to the lyrics blasting from the car stereo in the next lane here.

Or paid attention to Harold Ford Sr. or King Willie&apos;s rants before...etc.

Slurp it up, Wendi. You don&apos;t report when local black politicians make everything a race issue, but when a white politicians who cares about his district complains, then you rant. When white politicians try to aid their own districts, it is racist, but when black politicians (and Steve Cohen) pull government money to their districts, it is helping the oppressed. Go get yourself off.

Wendi has no problem with a city councilman who takes bribes, gets indicted and convicted, goes to jail then is released and re-elected. He then takes more bribes, is indicted and convicted again and goes back to jail. That&apos;s just one example of Memphis government post 1990. On a national scale, I think Maxine Waters had some nice words for the TEA party but, I guess that&apos;s OK too. A County Commissioner who is justifiably upset, as are his constituents, makes a few negative comments and that&apos;s worth making a big deal about.

People moved to the suburbs to get away from the cesspool that Memphis has become. Now, the city is forcing a hostile takeover of the SCS system down the throats of the suburban residents who have no interest in living the lifestyle currently adopted by Memphis and its residents. Terry Roland is upset. A lot of us are.

I have very fond memories of Memphis as I grew up there in the 70s. Many of the communities in Germantown and Collierville now are very reminiscent of what Memphis used to be. They are nice, low crime areas where people take pride in their communities. Now of course, the reality is that we will most likely have to move out of Shelby County eventually. When the Memphis cancer spreads into the rest of the Shelby County body there is really not much anyone can do about it. But, that doesn&apos;t mean we have to like it. Ten years from now we will be mourning the death of Shelby County just as we now mourn the death of a once vibrant city named Memphis Tennessee.

Actually, I prefer Terry Roland to much of what I see from other politicians today. He doesn&apos;t hide behind a veneer of civility like so many other public officials.

Take for instance school board members parading around with ties with stick kids on them hamming it up for the cameras saying&quot;It&apos;s all for the children.&quot;

I am so sick of that hypocritical B.S. I want to scream.

I don&apos;t have much in common with Terry Roland and I would not vote for him, ever. However, the citizens of his district chose him, and my guess is that his antics are a reflection of the yahoos who sent him there, just like Joe Brown, Ophelia Ford, Marsha Blackburn, etc.

Wendi, these people are a reflection of us. Why mask it with a bland sophistry which conceals the real truth?

Sadly, uneducated redneckdom is all too common in today&apos;s GOP.

You and I agree that most conservatives are good and decent folks (you agree with many of their political positions; I disagree with most of them).

So why don&apos;t more conservatives speak up and speak out instead of allowing the once-proud party of Lincoln to become the sewer party of Beck, Limbaugh, Palin, Bachmann and Perry?

While many would not agree with Roland&apos;s choice of words, many deeply appreciate the sentiments he expressed.

Perhaps Roland learned how to handle his political disputes from our own President -- remember when President Obama told a crowd in Philadelphia that they love a&quot;good brawl&quot;? Then he told them if someone brings a knife to a fight then they should bring a gun. Remember that, Wendi? (Here&apos;s a reminder: http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/06... ) Where was Wendi when that was stated? Our President campaigned on the idea that he was above political partisanship and would raise the level of civility in politics. In this political season, Obama as already set the tone and Roland is merely following the lead of his President. And let&apos;s not forget that Maxine Waters told the Tea Party to&quot;go to hell.&quot;Then there&apos;s the labor union president who implied in a speech in Chicago that he wanted to&quot;take out&quot;the Tea Party.

And how many times have we heard local politicians claim&quot;racism&quot;whenever they are unable to make a political argument or defend their position? To me, claiming racism when it is politically expedient is just as repugnant as politicians recommending that someone&quot;kiss their rear-end.&quot;

As far as Roland&apos;s spelling and punctuation skills, I don&apos;t think any graduate of MCS should throw any stones. How many times have I had someone in Memphis&quot;axe&quot;me a&quot;querstion&quot;? And Sara Lewis, who sits on the MCS Board, is always shedding tears for the chee-runs of Memphis. I&apos;ve lost track of the times I&apos;ve watched the local TV news and thought they must have found the stupidest person ever to interview on TV for the world to see. Guess, what? They&apos;re always a MCS grad!

&quot;They can all kiss me on my entire rear end...&quot;

How shockingly vulgar -- making references to... his REAR END! The horror!

I&apos;m so appalled that anyone in gentile Shelby County could ever imagine such a profane urban lingual construct!

We may have to pass a NEW LAW to preempt a stampede of rampant, unprecedented, antisocial, likely racist/sexist/homophobic offensive language -- we&apos;ll usher in a&quot;new era of civility&quot;. Like in Wisconsin! Like after the Arizona shooting!

Nobody in Shelby County has ever been subjected to such crass assaults on tender ears before!

Oh wait....unless of course you are a student here. In which case you&apos;ve heard (and maybe become proficient with) every possible combination/permutation of the f-word and familial references by the end of the first grade.

Or you&apos;ve ever stood in line at a fast food restaurant here.

Or strolled through any mall here.

Or listened to the lyrics blasting from the car stereo in the next lane here.

Or paid attention to Harold Ford Sr. or King Willie&apos;s rants before...etc.

America Still Awaits New Era of Civility After Arizona Shooting

So true. Don&apos;t care for what Rolland said, but it pales in comparison to the vulgarities of the rap culture and its apologists. All you race baiters can call my reference to rap culture&quot;code&quot;(and I&apos;m sure the narrow-minded and intellectually starved among you will), but the truth is that it crosses the lines of race but closely tracks the culture of the&quot;oppressed, angry and entitled&quot;. The rap culture has done more to degenerate public civility and decency than anything I have seen in my lifetime. Good time for an article on that, Wendi.

Ms. Thomas is correct--civility in politics is becoming the exception, not the rule.

With that said, I don&apos;t recall Ms. Thomas calling out California Democrat Maxine Waters when she made the comment that the TEA Party&quot;can go straight to hell&quot;.
 
&quot;Two wrongs don&apos;t make it right,&quot;whether it be Ms. Waters or Mr. Rowland; but this article is about Mr. Rowland, a&quot;LOCAL&quot;politician putting one more stain on the way we behave in positions of leadership. This is about how we conduct ourselves in Memphis, California has it&apos;s own problems. Terry Rowland inviting people on the outside to settle disputes is not the kind of person that should be sitting on any commissions, and I believe everyone agrees with that except for those people who continue to vote people like Mr. Rowland in office. So let&apos;s clean up our own house; let&apos;s set the example in something that we do, and stop being the laughing stock of this country. (THE)

No credibility with me. Living in East Memphis he would
Not be a constituent of Rolands to begin with. I I do believe
Hutton is a RINO. Roland kind of sticks in the craw of liberals
like Wendy and Hutton, it puts a smile on my face.

I agree. With Wendi it is selective moral outrage. I am at a loss to find a similar article on non whites from this moralist.
 
Then you don&apos;t really read articles about the Ford&apos;s, Mayor Herrenton, Rickey Peete, etc. This isn&apos;t about Black and White; this is about correct behavior versus Mr. Rolands behavior. Why can&apos;t you&quot;Tea Party&quot;people stick to the subject? (THE)

Interesting that Thomas has had some pretty poor comment numbers on her articles, of late. Guess this is the way to jazz up her numbers for Peck and company.

Quite a few posts summed up Wendi&apos;s hypocritical views and what she could be commenting on instead of this drivel.

Sadly, uneducated redneckdom is all too common in today&apos;s GOP.

You and I agree that most conservatives are good and decent folks (you agree with many of their political positions; I disagree with most of them).

So why don&apos;t more conservatives speak up and speak out instead of allowing the once-proud party of Lincoln to become the sewer party of Beck, Limbaugh, Palin, Bachmann and Perry?
 
Hi Robert Hutton, how are you?

One problem with Roland&apos;s rants is that he is not smart enough to know that some of his “critics” reside in his district. I am one of those critics, I live in his district and I voted for him. Now that I choose to criticize him, he has invited me to kiss his rear end. No thanks Mr. Roland. Not all of Roland’s constituents feel the same way he does on a number of issues. I personally am embarrassed by Roland’s conduct and his representation. He seems to think all his&quot;constituents&quot;reside in the City of Millington or that his only constituents are those who agree with his positions or who approve of the manner in which he has conducted himself. WRONG. I don&apos;t recall hearing or reading about Roland conducting a poll of his constituents who reside outside of the Millington city limits. I don&apos;t recall Roland conducting town hall meetings outside of the City of Millington. I can assure Mr. Roland that he has lost at least one vote if he seeks reelection. Not only will I vote against Roland, if someone else seeks this position, I will campaign for them. Based on my conversations with a number of others who live in this district, including blacks and whites and those who agree with him on the issues and those who don’t, I am not alone.

Slurp it up, Wendi. You don&apos;t report when local black politicians make everything a race issue, but when a white politicians who cares about his district complains, then you rant. When white politicians try to aid their own districts, it is racist, but when black politicians (and Steve Cohen) pull government money to their districts, it is helping the oppressed. Go get yourself off.
 
This has nothing to do with whether Mr. Roland works hard for his district. I live 20 miles from him so I really can&apos;t say. People in this area are upset about what a poor role model he makes when he uses such foul language in public. I don&apos;t care what race a person is. When they use this kind of language, it sets a bad example and makes the instigator look stupid.

Wendi, Your palliative journalism is as usual an obviously skewed piece of journalism that is coherent only to the readers with little self esteem and hearts blackened by hate.
Your thoughts are as meaningless as tits on a bore hog.
You along with many blacks want to portray any caucasian as the cause of any and all failures of your race which is in a death spiral due to the total incompetence of Obama.
Your articles are in line with such racist statements as morgan Freeman whom pronounced the Taxed Enough Already party as being racist.

The fact is that America has opened its eyes to accomplisments rather than self proclamation of undue rights merely due to skin pigmentation and false promises.
Obama has himself undermined worthy deeds by deserving blacks to be ordained as questionable.
Obama has also reversed the civil rights of blacks by general populus prospective to that of pre 1963 opinion.
You could better help the black population by positive articles rather than the same racist rants that dominate your limited mentality.
 
Did you mean: boar hog?

Sad thing is, we have no real choice.

Both Roland and Wendi are acting out a scripted performance to appeal to the basest emotions in order to keep their jobs.
