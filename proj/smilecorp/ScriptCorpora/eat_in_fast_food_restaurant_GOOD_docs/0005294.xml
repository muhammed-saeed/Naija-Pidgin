Fast food is a fast-growing segment of the restaurant business. The Bureau of Labor and Industries predicts higher-than-average growth in the fast food industry through 2018. If you operate a fast food restaurant or are thinking of getting into the business, several types of insurance will protect you against unexpected losses.
 
General Risk Insurance

Risk insurance replaces your restaurant building, fixtures and contents. Risk insurance typically covers damage from fire, weather and the like. Coverage should extend to your exterior signage and landscaping. You can purchase insurance that covers the replacement value of your property or the fair market value of your property. If you choose to insure at market value, your insurance costs are less but your contribution toward replacing your property is higher.
 
Liability Insurance

Liability insurance protects against claims others make against your property. The two major types are product liability insurance and premises liability insurance. Product liability insurance covers claims related to the products you sell, such as food poisoning claims. Premises liability insurance involves occurrences on the restaurant premises, such as slip-and-fall injuries.
 
Business Interruption Insurance

Several types of insurance replace the income your restaurant loses if you have to close the business temporarily. Lost income insurance, business interruption insurance and food spoilage insurance all fall into this category of coverage. Many of your operating expenses, such as your lease and franchise fees, continue regardless of whether your restaurant is open for business. Business interruption insurance provides funds with which to pay those expenses.
 
Other Insurance

Several other types of insurance are advisable for a fast food restaurant. Workers compensation insurance requirements for your employees vary depending on the state where you operate. If your restaurant owns commercial vehicles, you need vehicle insurance. A restaurant should ensure against theft of property or cash. You may also wish to purchase enhanced insurance coverage that protects against employee theft, arson, power failures or drainage backups.
