“Dear President Obama”: The President Reads 10 Letters a Day from the Public, With Policy Ramifications
   Email 563 Smaller Font Text Larger Text | Print 
The letter to President Obama came from a woman in Arizona whose husband lost his job. He was able to find work, but the new gig came with one-third the pay; the family is struggling to make their mortgage payments.

 

The letter from the Arizona woman illustrated a policy conundrum, recalled senior adviser David Axelrod. President Obama read it, and absorbed the lesson.“She said they had made all their mortgage payments, but were running out of money,”Axelrod said.“And they were told they could not renegotiate unless they were delinquent in their payments.”

 

Before President Obama’s housing speech last week, he’d made copies of his letter and“sent it to his financial team and said,‘This is the kind of person our housing plan should help,”Axelrod recalled. The president had other copies made of that letter. He had it distributed to staff on Air Force One.“He had been struck by how powerful the story was,”White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said.“He wanted us as we were creating policy to make sure that we were listening and hearing these examples as well.”

 

Every day President Barack Obama is handed a special purple folder. The folder contains ten letters, and every day President Obama takes time to read them. Are they from world leaders? From members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? Members of the intelligence community? No, these letters have been culled from the thousands the White House Correspondence Office receives each day from Americans who have taken the time to sit down and write to their president.

 

“They help him focus on the real problems people are facing,”says Axelrod.“He really a absorbs these letters, and often shares then with us.” In his first week in office, President Obama requested that he see 10 letters a day“representative of people’s concerns, from people writing into the president,”recalls Gibbs,“to help get him outside of the bubble, to get more than just the information you get as an elected official.”Says Axelrod,“he did it because his greatest concern is getting isolated in the White House, away from the experiences of the American people…The letters impact him greatly.”

 

Some recent examples, according to aides, include a letter from a businessman who owns a manufacturing company and says he finds it very difficult to lay off employees who have done nothing wrong. If things don’t improve, the correspondent wrote, he’ll have to lay off 10% of his workforce.

 

Another letter came from a divorced senior citizen raising a grandchild on a fixed income, including Social Security. She confessed to being depressed and scared. A third came from a realtor who urged the president to do something about the large number of foreclosed properties. A fourth was a plea for help from an unemployed truck driver.

 

Monday through Friday the head of White House Correspondence delivers ten letters to be read by the President, choosing among letters that are broadly representative of the day’s news and issues; ones that are broadly representative of President’s intake of current mail, phone calls to the comment line, and faxes from citizens; and messages that are particularly compelling. Some of these, maybe two or three each day, the President responds to in his own hand.

 

Gibbs says that before two different economic speeches, the President“pulled letters he has gotten and distributed them to staff, to understand what people were going through.”The vast majority of the calls coming into the White House, and over a third of the faxes have been on the stimulus package and the economy, so up to half of the letters the President sees are on that broad subject.

 

Aides say that many of these correspondents also have other complications: bankruptcy due to health care, lost job, lost opportunities for their children. A smaller number of the letters address other issues, such as the environment, health care, education, foreign affairs, or nuclear proliferation. And a handful, usually no more than five a week, are from people who have a simple supportive message or inspirational story to tell. The head of correspondence also includes letters to the President from smaller children who ask questions or give advice. Sometimes the letters are include in the president’s overnight briefing book.

 

As the President addresses the immense issues the nation and world face—today the President will announce he’s appointing an inspector general to head the transparency and accountability board to supervise the stimulus spending, and will host an fiscal responsibly summit; Tuesday he will address the economy before a joint sessions of Congress; Thursday he will present his budget—the President’s aides say these letters help the president stay in touch with real people and ignore the chatter here inside the DC bubble.–jpt (Photos by White House photographer Peter Souza)

Except Obama’s housing plan will not help the people described in the letter.
The plan says the banks have to renegotiate the loan so that it is 31% of the household income.
If the guy has a new job paying 1/3 what he had before there is no way they can lower the monthly mortgage payments to meet his low income.
Bottom line–if there are no jobs or only low paying jobs then people with high mortgages are out.

President Obama’s massive mortgage-bailout plan is nothing more than a thinly disguised entitlement program that redistributes income from the responsible 92 percent of home-owning mortgage holders who pay their bills on time to the irresponsible defaulters who bought more than they could ever afford.
This is Obama’s spread-the-wealth program on steroids.

I’m really a cynic now but what is the purpose of putting this information out? Mr. President, I’m glad you’re human enough to be moved by people’s plight…now can we do something to really help them? Jake, don’t let them sucker you in…you are way smarter than that.

This is all public relations, and it is empty. Obama needs to stay in the oval office and get the work done, instead of galavanting around in Air Force One, as he brags about its luxury. His wife could focus less on fancy clothes and his kids don’t need to hang around with the Jonas brothers; rather they should show compassion for citizens in this difficult financial time.

Yes a folder full of“Oh Mr. President”all aobut how bad the country is. Wonder how many letters they get that say“stop this”or“I don’t agree”with this.
He won’t see those, nor will he want too….
How about some balance, 10 negative letters, 10 positive letters

This seems another distraction. I was ok w/ it and thinking, ok, so he’s a nice guy, but then he put in that they pass out copies to Air Force One staffers? Huh? What are they going to do? Right..back to the drawing board.

Sry, my bad. I thought he was passing it out to the staff of Air Force One, not the staff on Air Force One…still, another distraction though but I’m glad to see that he’s reading the 10 in a purple folder. I’m really trying to give him a chance but the more that comes out, the harder it is..It’s so tailored and w/ the photo-op. It screams fake to me.

I think there are people like me, that are willing to take care of themselves if given the chance. I have money tied up in an“employee owned”company that the company won’t allow me to access. I guess that doesn’t make good headline news stories.

Dear President Obama,
Thank you for the middle class tax cut which reduces the withholding tax on my paycheck. This gives me a little more money each payday but how does this reduce my taxes I owe at the end of the year? I was hoping for a tax cut but since it appears that this is only a reduction in the taxes withheld each month, I am going to save this money so I will have enough money to pay my income taxes at the end of the year…
Thanks….. I think. Sigmonde

My two cents:
I am a homeowner and live in Los Angele.
Some of these responses tell me, some of you are not homeowners. Foreclosure is really bad for homeowners. It drives the value down just like crime. I am losing value in my home everyday due to the foreclosure crisis. And so are many other people.
I would advise everyone to read the bill for themselves, and stop listening to the talking heads.

Very mature…I’m just more and more impressed w/ BHO followers. Can’t wait to see how one of his pet projects does in the emergency room should you end up there. There is less and less incentive to work hard…we’re all going to end up with nothing. I don’t think these guys understand that. Personally, don’t want my kids to strive for mediocre when they can be the best. Remember, that’s why people came to this country.

Given Obama’s extremely thin skin and huge ego–if the letter isn’t some adoring supporter in need it probably gets ignored.
Whenever BO reaches out to the opposition or the critics it is for his own publicity.
Come to think of it–it’s always about him.

yes i know its true teresa. its interesting too (and sad ) ,that the republicans see such empathy and substance of character as less than
genuine and some kind of ploy or act.
nope republicans ,there are actually some compassionate human beings left who really DO care about whats happening to their friends and neighbors. i am very proud of mr obama and his grandmother can rest easy and proud ; her grandson is proving daily to be a fine ,upstanding ethical man who i personally am very proud of and am very glad to have running this great country.

@ginger,
I AM A HOMEOWNER. We are living in our Second Home. We bought it 14 years ago this month on a 15 year mortgage. Making our last payment this week when I get paid! PAID OFF a YEAR EARLY!
My wife and I went through a lot of years of doing without to pay it off in 14 years AND we never missed a payment.
I am sad for the people losing their home due to Sickness, Job Loss. BUT, I don’t want to bail out someone that BOUGHT WAY PAST THEIR MEANS or BOUGHT FOR AN INVESTMENT!
Sorry.. I think there are a lot of Americans out there same as my wife and I. We did not borrow past our means, we paid our house payment on time even if it meant we could not get a New Car, TV, Cell Phone, or go on a fancy vacation. Why should we bail out those that DID NOT DO THIS!!!!
 
Posted by: ajax | February 23, 2009, 9:32 am 9:32 am
 
Do these guys think we are stupid? They pass a 75 billion dollar mortgage rescue plan but can’t say for sure who will benefit from it or how exactly they will benefit. Who is going to oversee 9 million homes that are estimated to be going into foreclosure? This is just another example of the“no experience”problem that faces this president.

ajax, alot of people got into their homes when they were artificially high (not really worth what they were told). Now that the house isn’t worth that amount, they can’t get the house renegotiated. Is that fair? I’ll grant you the notion of not bailing out the speculative investors and the ones that“reached too far”, but in the end if they go down, so do we all. It seems that we should aid those who really do need it, and“tell”the banks to renegotiate the others. Seems the banks haven’t adjusted the books to reflect the actual worth of these“toxic”assets and feel they’ll“loose”money. Guess what guys! You already have.

“nope republicans ,there are actually some compassionate human beings left who really DO care about whats happening to their friends and neighbors.”
And, some people are easily swayed by sentimentalism. I would rather respect my president than like him or her. I do not like the direction President Obama is taking our country but I wish him no ill will.
Republicans care about their neighbors, friends and family enough to keep up the good fight for a Representative Democracy in the face of an enormous tsunami of socialistic programs and bills. President Obama needs to read letters from those who do not agree with him to keep in touch with ALL Americans.
You may not like or appreciate Republicans but they are your neighbors and friends, too. They have lost jobs, houses and businesses in this economy. They believe in a different political philosophy than you do, but they love America, too.

I hope President Obama reads this blog: Where are the stimulus checks that was talked about when the first $700 billion was given out. How come that is being put on the back burner. If we are going to keep paying taxes, then why not give the American people a $20,000 or $30,000 check to stimulate the economy. You keep saying it needs to be done from the bottom up, but keep giving our tax paying money to these banks and car companies, who will not lend to people w/bad credit or who keeps making cars w/high price tags. Giving to them is not stimulating the economy. Unless the American people get a slice of the billion dollar pie, I will keep going exempt on my federal taxes and pay in pieces here and there until your new govt. decides to give back to the American people. I am sorry but $13 a weeks does not even cover gas for a week. As a matter of fact it is a slap in the face and an embarrassment for you to even think that the American people would be happy with that. We want a stimulus check or the economy will not bounce back, more stores will close, no cars bought, no vacations, no nothing until we get our share of the pie, and not no funky $600 or $1000 check which could barely pay 1 or 2 bills. Send us something besides throwing the American people a bone, while the big companies get away with just spending our money and having the nerve to come back and ask for more. Well I am asking for more, let see if I and other American tax payers will get it.

Hey struggeling home owners…I have lived in a two bedroom Apratment for ten years with my wife and kids, we make decent money and have been svaing to buy a house all this time…Tell me why My hard earned tax dollars should bail any of you out? I haven’t gone out and got myself over-extended…does living in an apratment suck? Yes, but I am not upside down in my house and cars either…Take a lesson…quit living beyond your means and then expecting the government and my money to fix your stupidity.

Why should we have to pay for people that were irresponsible. This is so unfair and is really dividing our country. I don’t know about you but when you count property, state, city, and sales tax we are close to 60% of income goes to taxes, how much more can they take from us? We live in Balti, Md. where only 25% of residents pay taxes and 75% consume taxes, OH and the entire city is run by??? You guessed it Democrats

STOP helping people who defaulted on their mortgage because they were greedy. STOP helping people who are living beyond their means. STOP rewarding bad behavior. I am ANGRY about your Stimulus bill. Do not think you have 4 years and people will forget. I voted for you for change. But it loks like you are going to the other extreme.
Best way is to give incentive for new young buyers, who can pay the mortgage, but do not have downpayments and help them qualify to buy houses from these bad people. 4 years is not far away. I am disappointed that I voted for you.

If a retired teacher can figure out that the best stimulus to the economy would be to simply rein in the credit card interest rates, you would think that the“big brains”could. If the banks could charge no more than 10% interest (a fair amount), folks could pay down the debts and would begin to purchase again. Duh. Many people have credit card payments in excess of 300–500 dollars a month without reducing their debt and struggle to keep up.

Mr. President, take the money&amp;give it to the Americans who need it. Shoot, maybe I’d start my own business,&amp;NOT overextend myself! No one bails US out, do they? The bank doesn’t say, ok, skip a month on your car payment, that’s ok. If you split the $ among all Americans over 18, regardless of tax, employment, or marital status, that’s about $3300 each!! That beats $13. While you’re at it, make the driving age 21 federally. Too much money is wated via insurance, court costs,&amp;car repairs, it is insane. Encourage college education instead. Teach kids how to drive, not tool around a parking lot.

RAISE THE DRIVING AGE!
I rent a tiny apartment, been raising 2 kids there for years. A year ago I was preapproved for $200,000 to buy a house. I am now approved for $100,000. My income has gone UP. Because I could not afford the payments on a $200,00o home, I did not buy one. Yet no homes are available to me now, not even a condo. I tried to get an estate sale, the house had no sale value for over 50 years,&amp;I still couldn’t get it. Make housing affordable for all Americans, OUTSIDE of the slums!

This president has accomplished more in his first month than any president I can think of. He has more on his plate than any president I can think of. Those critics out there try to imagine what he is dealing with, what a mess GWB left him. The Republican Congress and GWB turned a surplus into a deficit with Tax Cuts and War spending. When the Democrats took over congress, they were stopped by the Decider’s veto pen and the Republican party’s lack of bipartisanship. Don’t let them pull the wool over your eyes and try to tell you they are the party of“fiscal responsibility”. They justified all the spending in the name of“patriotism”. Where is their patriotism now I ask. Is supporting our country any less important than supporting our troops?

Do his minders choose letters that disagree with him? As long as there is someone choosing what he reads, he isn’t really staying in touch with“the people”.
Governing via anecdote is no way to make decisions. There are, tragically, always sad stories. He is the government of the whole country, and needs to make long term decisions, not govern the many by focusing on the saddest, most compelling stories.

Nine of the ten letters must come from ACORN.
They got $4 billion.
He obviously reads none of my letters, which ask why, in spite of my paying my mortgage and conducting myself responsibily that I am entitled to absolutely no break of any kind. I lost 40% of my retirement portfolio but Obama uses me only as a piggybank.
When is he going to read my letter?

To all the Obama Lovers….I hope you haven’t forgotten two of Obama’s most quoted statements…Which are just beginning to take shape…(1)”Should the winds turn ugly, I will side with my MUSLIM BROTHERS”(and, now, he is closing Gitmo…just the first of many favors to“His Muslim Brothers”).(2)”It is going to take a LOT OF MONEY to do WHAT I WANT”….Looks like he’s not kidding….a LOT of money…to do what HE WANTS…Not what America wants or what is good for America…What HE WANTS…AND…White Males are going to take the biggest bashing/beating…..America is going to be SO TOTALLY SCREWED with this guy and his Cabinet of Chicago Crooks, Re-Cycled Clintonists, and Democratic DC Insiders who have no interest in positive change….Congratulations to all the brain-dead Lib-Dems out there…Welcome to the Socialist Republic of ObamaLand….

On the one hand there are many of us that have been struggling before“the bubble burst”, and the economy correction was long overdue. The decisions of the government (stimulus, etc.) at this point are baffling. Why not let things self-correct instead of giving us decades of debt we won’t feel the benefits of? Why not let us take care of each other–without taxing us as a penalty for doing so? Minimize the welfare program payouts unless they also require hours worked at a food pantry or child care, for example.
I’m willing to pay my fair share for benefits and protections, but this current trend is out of hand.
My spouse died four years ago in his mid-30s. Since then I have had to skip or think hard on many decisions given that the household income was cut in half. When things break, they have often stayed broken as I don’t have the income to fix them and also pay the mortgage. At this point I’m feeling a little silly for acting responsibly and paying my bills…But I will continue to do so. Like many of those who have entered comments here, I feel like I am being asked to“share the burden”when it is no action of mine that put us in this mess. Rewarding bad behaviour at the top and the bottom makes me wonder how long until the middle has a structural failure and we pancake.

You notice that Obama’s answer is always more taxes and more handouts.
If that woman and her husband need jobs then the thing to do is incentivize the creation of jobs, not tax the remaining jobs into oblivion.
What happens when there are no more jobs and no more“other people’s money?

There are people who are loosing their homes because they lost jobs in this bad economy, a loved one died or got sick and medical costs crippled their budget. There are people who have seen the price of their home drop considerably because their next door neighbor has defaulted. Is it fair that those who play by the rules have to pay for those who’s reach exceeded their grasp? No. But most of you who’ve wrapped yourself in righteous indignation seem to forget that the the defaulting housing market IS THE VERY LIFE BLOOD OF THIS RECESSION. Sure you could just let the ones who played fast and loose crash and burn but that will not help freeze up credit and credit is the grease that moves the cogs of our economy. If you can’t get credit you can’t buy a car, can’t get a house, can’t get a student loan, businesses can’t by goods and make payroll and people loose more jobs and the unemployed end up getting your money through unemployment checks and other government services. There are several instances in life where the just thing to do isn’t the smart thing to do. It’s a large and bitter pill to swallow, bailing out selective homeowners (or anyone else for that matter) but it’s an unfortunate, yet necessary, evil.

I bet you are living really good in your nice house and your job is intact…..at least people can get food stamps until they can land back on their feet.

To all the people upset at the idea of helping people who are in trouble with their mortgages, how much are you personally willing to pay to extract your justice on the people who got in over their head?
When your two or three people in your neighborhood default on their mortgages your property value will immediately take a hit. The bank isn’t going to put a lot of money into upkeep while it tries to unload it. When the grass starts growing and neighborhood kids break out a window or two, your property value takes another hit. and then, when it finally comes up for auction and some crack dealer buys it for a song, forget about it.
Oh and think the drop in property values is at least going to help you with your property taxes? Wrong. The county’s getting less revenue so its going to have to raise rates.
Somehow in this country, we let the Republicans convince us that if you earn less than 500k a year, making a bad personal finance decision is a sin, a grave moral transgrssion worthy of punishment. Well its not. Its a just a mistake. For many of the people who made them, the mistake was perfectly rational at the time. For the others, their real mistake was thinking that their lender wouldn’t be lending them money the lender didn’t think it could get back and that their real estate agent had their interests at heart. The former was rational if you didn’t know they could pack it into a poke with a bunch of other pigs, slice it up into a dozen pieces so small that no one could tell what they were, and then sell all the pieces to rubes on Wall Street. The latter was rational–they were paying the agent to look out for them. Unfortunately, the agent’s commission depended upon the size of the purchase price.
The economic bind we’re in is what it is, anger isn’t going to fix it and punishing the wicked people who made bad calls will only make it worse for everyone. Period. So the question is whether you’re willing to cut off your own nose to see these people get what you think is their just desserts, whether, that is, you’re willing to see your personal wealth diminish to see them punished or whether you’ll help them out and, in the process, preserve some of your own equity.
And it if makes you feel any better, trust me: regardless of whether they get bailed out, the people facing foreclosure have and they will suffer plenty.

I wonder if Obama has even read his housing bailout plan.
From the Questions and Answers for Borrowers about the
Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan:
“Eligible loans will now include those where the new first mortgage (including any refinancing costs) will not exceed 105% of the current market value of the property. For example, if your property is worth $200,000 but you owe $210,000 or less you may qualify.”
Since most house prices have dropped 20, 30, 40, 50% and are still falling none qualify for this program.

From the the plans Q&amp;A:
“How do I know if I qualify for a payment reduction under the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan?
In general, you may qualify for a mortgage modification if (a) you occupy your house as your primary residence; (b) your monthly mortgage payment is greater than 31% of your monthly gross income; and (c) your loan is not large enough to exceed current Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits.”
Plus your mortgage cannot be more than 105% of the current value of the house.
(Because if you house was worth a lot more than the mortgage the bank would boot you out and sell it.)
None of those people cited in the Obama letters meet any of those criteria above.

I was told I had to be behind in order to qualify. I told him that because I have cut everything back including food budgets to be able to make my house payment(because thats the last thing I’d ever want to lose) I don’t qualify? He said that’s right. If I sat on the couch and said the hell with my mortgage they’d help me. I then asked if they were part of the banks that got the infusion of money from they bailout. He said yes. I asked him where he thought he got that money…us the tax payers. He said he was sorry and if they helped everyone that called they’d be broke in a day.

Sorry—-This plan only covers the first mortgage on the house.
Bottom line on over 75% of these troubled mortgages is the only way the people could stay in the house is for the govt. to make their monthly payments.
If one has no job it does not matter how low the mortgage rate goes, one can not pay it.

Instead of this Obama should be making jobs–lowering taxes for businesses that higher people, subsidizing wages for the newly hired.

A reply to Chris, Cali and others, who are of the believe that those facing foreclosure, brought it on themselves by over extending their income. Granted, some have and banks were stupid for lending the money, but remember, GREED rules business.
However, you seem to forget about those who have lost because of major illnesses or major surgeries, which made them fall behind, or about the need for a 2 income family who lost a job.
I will agree with you on the fact that Obama’s stimulus will never help the common person–only big business and Unions, which if you read anything today, then you have to wonder if he is turning us into a NATIONALIZED Nation with his taking over banks and the multi-billions he gave to the auto industry.
But then, what do yo expect from someone who has TAX EVADERS as Secretaries of his Cabinet?

“I said must be nice to have a safety net like the government.. where’s my safety net?”
Your story is a good example of why the government should not be in the business of bailing out homeowners if they can’t pay their mortgage. No government in the world rescues homeowners by paying their mortgage. Yes, you are having difficulty but your difficulty stems from your being laid off and the difficulty of making your payments. Safety nets are buying income continuation insurance in event you lose your job, your savings, and budgeting for potential tough times.

I don’t know why this is a story. All presidents receive letters from constituents, read them and respond. This is nothing new.
As for the woman in Arizona, who wrote to Obama about not being able to afford much else after her husband lost a job then accepted a new one at one-third the salary—if that family can no longer afford the home they are in and they didn’t save enough money to cover their expenses for a year after a potential job loss, it’s time to downsize. That’s life’s sad reality–you don’t buy a house without saving and planning for things like accidents, illness and job loss. And sadly, that’s the reality people expect Obama to change. If you spend money like there is no tomorrow and fail to save and you don’t want to downsize, let the government come in and save you. There’s no shame in renting or downsizing–unless you’re an elected official hoping to score some points.
Recessions, like all business cycles, have ups and downs. There are winners and losers in each recession. It’s during recessions that we see the investment groups come together–housewives, coworkers, neighbors, etc.–who pool their money together and invest in properties or stocks and end up making lots of money. Today’s middle class should be tomorrow’s top wage earners–that’s how the cycle goes. Obama’s plan disrupts that cycle and that’s pretty sad. It seems the days of housewives pooling their money together to buy stocks, real estate, etc. are over.

Peolpe have saved their money.. And they’ve run through it. This is going too long and the estimated 6 to 12 moths of savings for things like that isn’t enough. Remember this recession went on 6 mths prior to the last year without the government acknowledging a recession.. The are good people out there that were prepared who are unable to sustain now because of the length and depth…Must be nice to be in your position because it seems as if you fairing well.. but rest assured without helping people in the boat your refering to, you too maybe be there soon without even knowing it today…I hope you aren’t..

Also, don’t you think that some of these people complaining about mortgages, are the ones who bought a house they could not afford, most of these people live beyond their needs
anyway. Plus the mortgage companies were putting through loans that should not have been okayed to begin with.
It seems to me that many people are complaining about Obama, why????? He’s been in office ONE MONTH, and it seems to me that you should give him a chance. He is trying and he came into office with a real mess THAT HE DID NOT CREATE. When you started a new job, did you know everything the first month? I believe that he is watching everything and is trying to solve the problems, but everything can’t be done in one day, week or month.

You’re right. That’s the type of behavior this bill helps. It’s not aimed at those who help themselves and play by the rules, it’s aimed at those who continue overspending while not paying their mortgage–this is the New America.
I don’t know where you live, but in most metropolitan areas, there are companies that are set up to show homeowners how to milk the system–they’re popping up all over the country (as they always do in response to most gov. programs)–most are telling homeowners to stop paying their mortgage and save the money . They’ll still lose their home (they probably would have anyway), but they’ll live mortgage-free in their house for anywhere for 4 months to a year in the meantime and could walk away with cash.
IN this new America, there’s no point to playing by the rules. Get what you can and move on.

It’s refreshing to finally have a President who represents the people and not just the wealthy, spoiled, and selfish.
I guess it absolves the conscience of the rich to blame people losing their homes but the truth is that most of those people are losing their homes, not because they did anything wrong, but because Bush and his greedy administration destroyed the economy with their enormous tax cuts and give aways to corporations and to the wealthiest individuals in our country, along with the trillions spent in Iraq or stolen. That, combined with a complete lack of oversight, caused this mess we’re in. None of these people would have lost their homes had the government done its job. Because of this millions of Americans are losing their jobs and without a job they cannot pay their mortgages. I guess it makes those here who want to punish their fellow Americans for something out of their control feel better by grabbing on to the Republican smoke screen.”The victim is guilty. He bought too big a house or he couldn’t afford it. Its his fault. He can’t have my money.”Well, its his money too. He paid taxes as long as he had a job. He didn’t buy a house too big or above his means. The Republican controlled government who refused to stop their raid of the U.S. Treasury after stealing Clinton’s trillion dollar surplus and who just kept filling their pockets with the people’s gold did this. I say its high time the rich buzzards paid back some of that money by finally paying their fair share of taxes. Never before has this country lowered taxes during war time or given million dollar refunds to wealthy individuals who paid little to no taxes. It has always raised them but the last administration was totally and completely fiscally irresponsible. Its time to change that. President Obama should tax these corporations and wall-street executives etc. and fill up the people’s treasury to help the people of this country who need it. That is not welfare. It is merely doing the job of good government. These corporations and executives have become wealthy on the backs of the poor and the middle class whom they have been stealing from for years. Its time to give the money back.
We, the people, need to support our President. He’s one of a few on the people’s side who are really of the people, by the people, and for the people. We need to ignore the rhetoric and the lies being spewed on hate radio and in the media and stop and think. That stimulus package is on the web. Read it. Know when these bozo’s are lying about it and trying to fool you into being against that which will help you and your family. They do not represent you, they represent only the rich corporations and wall-street type executives and the powerful lobbyists from foreign countries who take your jobs overseas who are against working families and American labor.
One more thing, Thank you Mr. President for doing exactly what you said you would do and may God be with you.

To which I reply: then why did the GOP Senators and Representatives AVOID all true debate? Why did they act so stubborn instead?
Besides: debate is not unconditionally a good thing. Only intelligent, structured and timely debate is. The‘debate’lead by Rush Limbaugh is none of the above!

It is nice to see that there are still some people who use their head and heart instead of talking points when it comes to other Americans. No, I am not in foreclosure and I am still employed (thankful for both). To those that are not as fortunate as I am, I will say I have no problem helping out. That is what neighbors and communities are supposed to do. Complaining changes nothing. Pointing the finger and condemning does nothing. I will do my part to make America a better place. That is the only way it is going to happen; one person at a time.
Fellow Americans, keep your head up!

Mags–I know. This bill is a slap in the face to those of us who played by the old rules, but what can ya do when your leaders won’t listen? My advice to you Mags is to play by the new rules. These days, what do you have to gain by doing things right? If your business prospers, you pay your bills and mortgage on time, you save for bad times, somehow, in the end, you’ll be perceived as the bad guy while your neighbor, who probably vacations in the Bahamas, doesn’t pay his mortgage on time, has zero work ethic, gets the“help”he needs.
All markets go through cycles–you take the good with the bad and when times are good, you save and prepare for the bad times. Trouble is, most people just don’t save anymore so they panic during the bad times.
Funny thing is, even though everyone is complaining that the economy is horrible–people are losing their jobs, houses, etc., we went out to eat Friday night and there was a 45 minute wait because the restaurant was so crowded. Despite these dire economic times, every week, restaurants are crowded.
You have to stop and wonder, how many of these people flocking to Olive Garden or Red Lobster are waiting for the government to save their home.
And I do listen do Beck sometimes! Not all the time, and I listen to Rachel Maddow too, but I do listen, and yes, it’s scary!

Whether you agree or disagree with the President’s housing plan or stimulus plan, you have to commend him for his willingness to listen and to keep in touch with everyday Americans. I know of no other president who has done this.
There is no plan that will immediately help everyone at the same time, but in the long run everyone will see a benefit.

It’s good that Obama reads letters from citizens but I’m sure those letters are the most sanitary of the sanitized. While I have no problem with his people putting the hate mail into File 13, I wonder how many dissenting viewpoints end up on Obama’s desk, especially considering the wealth of tear-jerker mail that makes for good“he cares about the people”headlines.

I wonder if anyone has really read, understood, did some calculations on this bailout of late mortgage payers?
- Did you know taxpayers will be giving banks $1,000 just to do the paperwork on this refinancing–whether one qualifies or not? (Why don’t the banks pay for it themselves? They gave these unqualified people the loans.)
- Did you know taxpayers will be giving banks and bad debtors $10,000 for staying in the plan for five years? (Do you or I get $10,000 bonus for paying our mortgages on time?)
- Did you know taxpayers will pay half the amount to the bank for each dollar the bank lowers the monthly mortgage payments? For example, If the monthly mortgage payment goes from $1,500 a month to $1,000 a month (a $500 difference), taxpapyers will pay $250 of that to the bank–in one year, for this example, that is $3,000 taxpayers will pay on this person’s mortgage.
(Why can’t every mortgage holder have that deal?)
- Did you know that a“loan”judge can now lower bad loan mortgage rates to as low as 2%?
(Why doesn’t everybody get these new lower interest rates on their mortgages?)
- Did you know that the plan includes taxpayers paying $2,500,000,000 ($2.5 BILLION) for debt counseling classes? To be in the program one has to attend debt counseling classes.
(The number one lesson: Don’t pay your bills and the U.S. taxpayer will spread its wealth to you and pay your debts.)

The world is not black and white. In this case, helping out those who can no longer pay their mortgages, although deemed unfair for those who did follow the rules, is the more proudent choice given the current situation. Yes, I understand the personal argument of“this isn’t fair to ME”and“I pay MY mortgages on time, why do they deserve aid if I didn’t get any?”. However, if we ignore the plight that THEY are in right now, it drags down the whole system; a system that YOU are a part of. It’s not enough to observe direct effects. Often, the strategic responses actually play a greater role.

You all forget, this is JUST about the people who went and go mortages they couldn’t afford. I so got caught, but not because I bought a house with fake papers referring to my paycheck etc.
My husband and I have been homeowners for 30 years. 18 months ago his dad died and we bought the house from the estate, fixed ours up and put it on the market, then the shoe dropped, then the other……….then before you knew it we had 2 houses and one we could not sell. We’ve tried selling, we tried renting, we’re trying rent to own. We are NOT deadbeats, we’ve always paid our bills and, paid them on time. Problem is, now our old house is worth less than what we owe, because of the market, (not through anything we did wrong or bad) but now we’re trying to do a short sale, or possibley a deed in lieu of foreclosure. I was absolutely heartsick, depressed, lost a lot of weight, had trouble eating and sleeping because of the situation. But in the end, I had to face up, I can’t keep paying 2 mortgages, and I can’t sell it. My husand and I are very lucky to still have our jobs, and I work a second job so we’re not LAZY, WELFARE people.
These were circumstances that are beyond our control. I don’t control the market and the economy. I’m not a bad person and I pay my bills, but I cannot keep doing 2 mortgages indefinitely. Don’t lump everyone together.
Also, tho you may be angry at those that took mortgages they couldn’t afford, and at wall street for being so greedy. Thing is, we are in this situation, that is now affecting ALL of us, and if we want to get out, we all have to pay our dues.
Trust me when I tell you, there are lots out there that were like me, paying bills, paying them on time…but we had no clue this depression was coming..and though I really hate to politizie the subject but If Bush, just told us the truth 18 months ago, things MAY have ended up different.

No mention was made of the thousands of letters President Obama receives in reagrds to illegal aliens. Why is that? The cost that the millions of illegal aliens here in the U.S. has put such a burden on the American taxpayer; from our tax dollars going to fund special programs for illegals, to our jobs being taken from us by greedy corportaion and given to greedy illegals willing to work for less with no thought of safety, and there’s no mention of it in this article. What about the billions of dollars illegals send as remittances to their country of origin instead of putting that money back into the U.S. coffers? And the people in the White House see no need to mention it? I’m so glad the wind of change is here to see to American needs. (that’s sarcasm for those who missed it)

In response to Anon:
Just wanted to clear up a misconception. President Obama wanted to put a cap on the execs salary at $500,000 but the Repubs wouldn’t go along with it. What happened though was that (I think it was either Dobbs or Durkin) a clause was slipped in that put restrictions on their bonuses. I believe they don’t get any more bonuses until they pay back the stimulus loan to the government which is a great incentive to them to pay it back to the taxpayers. As you recall, they paid themselves $18.5 million dollars in bonuses recently.

Lord, this is my daily prayer for Your child and servant President Barack Obama. I pray You will direct his paths as he lean not on his own understanding but acknowledges You in all of his ways.–Proverbs 3:5,6.
Lord may You meet all Barack’s needs according to Your glorious riches in Christ Jesus.–Philippians 4:19.
Lord, strengthen Barack in everything he does, because as it is written in Philippians 4:13–[Barack] can do everything through You who gives him strength.
Lord, I pray that you command Your Angels concerning Barack, to guard
him, his family, and administration in all of their ways. May You command them to lift Barack up in their hands, so that he will not strike his foot against a stone. Psalm 91:11,12
Lord, subdue and render Barack’s enemies powerless. May you cause confusion in their camp. May you punish them and destroy them. Lord do save Barack from all of those who seek to and are hell-bent on working distruction, evil, and negativity. Those who desire to see his administration fail. Those who seek to be more about hindering and opposing, rather that working with the servant You have placed as the leader of this Nation. Lord, you promised in Your Word to save Barack from the hands of the wicked and redeem him from the grasp of the cruel. -Jeremiah 15:21. May it be done so in Jesus’Name.
Lord, it is written that You are the the God of peace, and You promised that You will soon crush Satan under Barack’s feet. May it be done so in Jesus’Name.
Lord, You have declared in Isaiah 54:17, that no weapon forged against Barack will prevail, and he will refute every tongue that accuses him. For this is Barack’s heritage because he is a servant of the LORD, and this is his vindication from You, declared the LORD.
Lord, may You bless Barack, his family and adminstration and keep them; Lord may You make Your face shine upon them and be gracious [ and merciful ] to them; Lord may You turn Your face toward them and give them peace.–Numbers 6:24-26
Now Lord, You are able to keep Barack from falling and to present him before Your glorious presence without fault and with great joy. LORD, You are the only God our Savior, so may glory, majesty, power and authority be unto You, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!
It is in Jesus’ Name and Blood I pray and believe. Amen, amen, and amen.

anon–When someone who can’t afford their house loses that house, it is someone else’s gain (usually a small investor or a middle class family looking to move up or subsidize their income by buying rental property).
That’s business. That’s the way the game is played. If you can’t or don’t make payments you lose your house and someone else benefits. A recession is nothing more than money (or property) changing hands—problem is, with helping people restructure their loans to better afford something they couldn’t afford in the first place, nobody gains. It’s everyone’s loss because the market cycle has been disrupted.
Think about it this way—you’re walking down the street and you have a $20 bill in your pocket. You still have money in savings and the $20 will come in handy, but you don’t need it to survive. Somehow, maybe due to a hole in your pocket, that $20 falls out. You don’t realize it and keep on walking. It might be tough for a while, but you’ll survive. There are safety nets and resources to help you get through.
But that $20 bill is still out there. Someone comes along and they find it and benefit from it. Your loss is someone else’s gain. But you gain from the experience too. You learn to be more careful with your money. You learn to make sure there are no holes in your pockets and you come back stronger. You save your pennies, invest them wisely and guard them closely. Next thing you know, you’re stronger for losing that $20.

For all you griping about folks who are having trouble paying their mortgage–there are many reasons why otherwise responsible people get behind, including major health crisis without health insurance and loss of income due to job loss (your own job, divorce etc.) You can put 20% down, pay for years and set money aside for emergencies but that rainy day money only lasts so long. What used to take 3-6 months to find a new job now can run a year or longer.
And I see very few mentions of another point. Those buying more house than they could afford at the time of purchase, whether McMansions, second homes, using liars loans (overstating income): where was the normal due diligence performed by the lenders? These folks could never have gotten any sort of loan with the complicity of lenders, who are now quick to blame the borrowers, ignoring their major role in the fiasco. If they stuck to fixed rate 15 and 30 year mortgages based on verified income from employers and credit reports, the problem we now have with collapsing loans would be miniscule. Yet they got billions in bailout and we holler about helping individual borrowers?

WAKE UP MAYORS WHAT IS IS GOING TO COST YOU IF YOU DON’T ACCEPT, WHEN YOUR STATES WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET THERE UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENDED AND HAVE TO GO ON YOUR STATE WELFARE. Where is the savings for that? There are people who have lost there jobs almost a year ago and need that extention to survive.. The funny thing is most of the state Gov. that are turning it down the stimulus are republicans? Is it just politics as usual. Not to mention any names Sony P…Why is it the people that have lost nothing and will continue to loose nothing ( like our elected officials) go home to there warm homes and live off the taxpayers money do not really care about the American people. They are using there budgets as an excuse when it is playing politics as usual. I do believe President Obama is trying and does care. If our Congress, senate and other elected officals don’t we are in big trouble working class America. IT’S TIME TO WAKE UP AND SMELL THE BS

No one president has any more responsibility for the economic mess than any other. Greedy bankers, mortage brokers, money managers (Bernie) real estate sales, have more to do with the financial melt down than anything else, the continual easing of regulatory issues have been a continuing disgrace to presidents over the last 30 to 40 years. Out sorcing manufacturing and technology has killed the American way of life. If Steve Jobs was 20 years old to day and trying to manufacture computers in his garage, the city of San Jose would shut him down due to zoning laws, lack of permits, and complaints of jealous neighbors to lazy to try something like that to get off of some government handout.

Everyone needs to read the details of the bill. Only people who are current on their house payments are eligible, and it must be the only residence–no speculators. They are going to refinance what they have. This benefits all of us more than having a lot of empty houses that get vandalized and are a haven for kids and the homeless to hid in. Some of these people have been laid off in masses of thousands from their company and have“done the right thing”for years and find themselves looking for work amid those other thousands in the same town. I notice that all of the people who are ranting about bailing out losers still have their jobs and their health. So do I, but I can empathize with those, through no fault of their own, find themselves in a crunch.

I went to purchase a modest house long before things hit the fan, and was aghast at the bank asking what would be my“stated”income upon which my credit worthiness would be. Indignant at what I thought was an irresponsible lending practice, I went to another bank only to find it was the norm. Fortunately, I exercised self-discipline and borrowed what (I think) I can repay. Obviously many wrer not so self controlled. How to aportion the blame is a relevant question for determining the future of our banking system. As for me, I put much of it on Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac for ill-conceived mission of“democraticizing home ownership”(their words). This led other lenders into the practices I cite. yet those banks, and those to whom they lent, must share some of the ppain, for all should have known better. Friedman is much maligned these days, but his principles would have precluded this, for if the bankers were operating in a free market, uncorrupted by the FM twins free-lending ways, I doubt the bad loans would have occurred. I hope we can all remember this in the near future when we all will be sharing the pain.

According to Wikipedia the following are spent on health care in terms of percent of GDP. Japan 8.2 percent; Canada 10.0 percent; and US 16.0 percent are spent on health care. Japan has a health care system that is quasi-public. In Japan, you may keep your private health insurance if you are employed. However, all others have health insurance pooled with the government. To keep health insurance costs low with buying power. Canada has a single payee system with super buying power.
According to Wikipedia, Japan has the highest per citizen national deficit of all the developed countries of the world. Canada, until this year, has had a federal budget surplus. According to one Canadian government link, there are programs for people to start a business, find ways to education, and still be able to keep their health insurance since it is Canada. If the United States is to reduce our national deficit, the following are proposed when it comes to social security, Medicare and Medicaid.
I feel the best approach to get people back to work; we must approach this challenge in a team approach. Yet let people have the chance to keep their health insurance similar to Canada or Japan. Let us create a team of the following to work with individuals. To work with those who have not worked for years due to health or aging challenges. We need to help individuals win a job that matches their abilities and disabilities. Sometimes there are other barriers. Sometimes there are dependent adults or children being cared for by a person. Perhaps the person should not drive but needs work. Sometimes these and other situations may be barriers that keep a person from working.
Let us create a team of people such as a primary care physician, a nurse, a social worker, a legal person, a small business case-worker, and a teacher just to name a few.
A family physician and a Case Worker could determine who should be on the team. This team could identify the barriers keeping a person from working. Then community resources could be identified to help a person get back to work.
Could it be they need to rely on public transportation? Could it be they need to have someone help with the care of a dependent person in their home? Are there legal questions such as tax, health care, power of attorney or other legal challenges that may complicate their return to employment? Could the best plan include working with the community college to assess and retool a person’s skill set? Or are there ways to help a person set up a new business with those new skills through the SBA.
Some people work well with people. They could become teachers or mentors. Some people may work better alone. Perhaps the worker could get Microsoft certification for an IT job. Perhaps the person could receive other community college training such as in construction. A new career could be identified that matches their physical and mental abilities.
In conclusion, if the United States wants to get more people back to work, reduce the spending on social security, Medicare and Medicaid, we should consider the following. Let us look at why Japan spends less on health care and why Canada has had a balanced budget. Perhaps a program with a team of professionals should be included to help all assess, retool and begin working with their new skill set. And at the same time, identify resources in the community that may be complicating the reason for people to get back to work.
Perhaps starting programs such as these may create the best return on the dollar.

Jim the Appraiser–Many governors are uneasy about accepting additonal money for Medicaid and UI because the money involves nearly 87 billion dollars given to the states for the next two years. After those two years are done, the Medicaid and UI funds go back to their original pre-stimulus package levels. This leaves the states in a tuff position because now they have hundreds of thousands of more people on the Medicaid or UI dole, but with pre-stimulus funding. Which means what?…You guessed it…exploding tax rates to cover the new people who are now on Medicaid and UI. And these governors also have a responsibilty to the people of their state. And one of those responsibilities is not to burden the producing population of their states with skyrocketing taxes. Think more intelligently and use the brain God gave you. Always beware of the government when it wants to“increase spending.”There is always a catch.

Don’t you think the welfare load is going to be increased anyway?
Posted by: Wallis Warfield Simpson | Feb 23, 2009 11:09:15 AM…Yes, I’m sure it will but why should Obama incourage it which he is doing. Please go to the National Black Republicans Assoc. site NBRA, and read what the democrats agenda has been for years, they are truly the racist party. Please do yourself a favor and read our side of the story.
I have news for you. The only black people that belong to anything Republicans are blacks that have plenty of money and they have learned the game of how to keep it! (lower taxes for the rich). If you watched the RNC you could count the black people on one hand. As the old saying goes: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
Talk about increasing welfare! What the heck do you think the banks and automakers are doing and not to forget Wall Street. They have their hands out and want taxpayers to foot the bill–what do you call that? I call it one of the biggest welfare bills taxpayers will see for generations to come.

I hope that most Americans will start to look at there own financial house to get it in order. I think its good whats happening to us because we trust the Republican and the Democratic party way to much. Most American we live above our means and we teach our children to do the same thing. I believe this election has caused people to start paying attention to goverment and big business. We might need to start looking at a 3rd party. I think Republican in congress are not in touch with all of America and the Democrate have to undertand that you cant help everyone. I do think we need to invest more in our own country but most people in big business have no integrity and too much greed. This is why wall street and banks and the automative companys are in trouble. A lot of people made a lot of money doing the wrong thing from refinancing homes to buy rental property that were bad loan deals. I would hope that we as a people will work on helping our self by being better steward of our money, teach our children and stop expecting the schools to raise our children because we are working two and three jobs to get a bigger house or a nicer car or game system and two hundred dollar tennis shoe for our kids, that we have not planned for. Plus we are having children that we dont want. We expect them to raise them self. I think for all this bull that is going back and forth on line, in the news, on radio. I would hope we would take more time to save more, read to our children and turn the TV off and try to help people within our familys and neighborhoods that are not doing what they need to. do by making bad decision.

Floretta–no one was forced or tricked into lying about their income on any mortgage application–that’s a myth. Yes, some lenders were too lenient and didn’t verify and some may have even suggested that borrowers lie, but in the end, it was the borrower who knowingly supplied false information and signed a legal, binding contract, who is responsible. Most did it with risky modified loans thinking they would own their home for six months and sell for a huge profit and no one would ever know they lied.
And if someone is losing their home because of a job loss–because they didn’t save enough money to cover expenses for a year or so–well, that’s the way it works. Obama’s plan isn’t going to help them anyway–and it shouldn’t.
Bottom line is, if you can’t afford your home, you have no right being in it. Move on and let someone who can afford it buy it. There’s no shame in renting or downsizing until you can afford something better!

Steph,
The article just mentioned examples of the letters the President gets that are representative of the problems facing the country. Illegals are not high on the list right now, and many are going back home because they are also hurting in this economy.
It is nice to have a President that even reads anything that is sent to the White House, and makes sure his people are aware of what is being sent.

Mr. President,
After I read the E-mails from the American working people, there is only one conclusion. The change and help is needed in all respects and on all fields in the U.S.A. today. America has become totally devastated by Bush.
I think you are doing everything as you has promised before you became president.
I wish I could give the courage to continue this very difficult and unpleasant path of your presidency.
Please be safe. You are somebody we all need in this once very prosperous
and humanitarian country!
Thank you very much,
Alicia

Where is the outcry for those CEOs who embezzeled their banks and companies on their way out giving themselves and cronies billions of dollars in“bonuses”so that they can keep their mansions? What gives these lowlifes the right to bankrupt companies and still live the life of opulence after they are gone (see Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros., etc). Meanwhile they companies and banks that more than gladly took them over got billions in bailout welfare knowing full well that those companies and banks were being looted but did nothing and looked the other way. Enough of always blaming the poor workers for the country’s plight. It was those SOBs and their greed that got us into this mess, not the poor guy that lost his job and can’t pay his mortgage now.

Tom Beebe–A loan or mortgage application asks for your“stated”income because not all your income has to be considered when applying for a loan. That protects the borrower. For example, if you are a single mother with a good income and you have two kids for which you receive child support, you wouldn’t want to include the child support in your“stated”income–it should be separate because if you default, all of your“stated”income can be used against you if the bank takes legal action against you for defaulting. YOu wouldn’t want the bank coming after your child support money would you? You also probably wouldn’t want them coming after whatever dividends you earn on your investments. When you apply for a loan, your stated income should be your wages and little else.

Really Mr. President.
Lets restore the constitution and bill of rights and actually defend it as sworn in to do instead of continuing to destroy it….. If you want to lead a country with a different constitution and bill of rights feel free to go back to Kenya, being born there you qualify completely. However this is our country, and I swore in to defend the constitution and will do exactly that. Its time to start removing people from office on a rapid basis , simply based on the fact that they either supported voted yes or wrote a bill that either changes or eliminates any part of the constitution. Because that is simply illegal. You swore in to protect it as it was not how you would like to see it. Im starting here in AZ and not stopping till we hit DC. Who knows though maybe a president who stands behind us will consider reading a letter from you…..

Yes he did–all presidents do. They usually respond in writing too. The difference here is that Obama is taking time out to read solicited letters–Bush never had his staff send email blasts to his campaign supporters asking for hard-luck stories from people.

Responding to lobbyist comments,(yes, Mags et al you’re not fooling everybody), is a waste of time. There have been many good points made by both sides, however, it’s obvious that the facts have been skewed in some cases. The new mortgage plan doesn’t go into effect until March 4. So those of you who have previously talked to your lender, you need to go back and check after the new program and new rules are in place. The previous information you got was under Bush’s TARP where there was no regulation and no rules. If you check your facts, you may be please with the results of further inquiry. That being said, I believe that Obama is accomplishing that for which he was elected. The majority wanted change and continue to support the change that’s being offered. The rest of you will just need to stifle, as we did when Bush was in office. And, we stifled because it’s important to support our Country, our People, (not just the one’s serving in Iraq), and our Leaders. Give things a chance–it’s only the beginning of change. Change takes time. For those of you who don’t want change (and some people don’t deal well with change of any kind), that’s okay too. You lost the election and change is what we voted for. Keep up the good work Mr. President.

Some republicans are still bitter over the election. And what they realize is that the Republican party has no leader, no direction, and no authority. This has caused them to be bitter and angry.. Another synopses that our GREAT President was correct about. He said there would be opposition, he said some would not agree with him, and he said,“Progress is pushing forward anyway”. So all you bitter people, please MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!!! The Barack Obama Prgoress train is coming…Either get on board or call Rush Limbaugh as he is the one directing the GOP right now…Hehehe..

My mortgage was only 395.00 but i got behind for six months as I coud not find work, I had no gas in my house and could hardly keep up with my lights,,I tried very had to keep my house I wen t o court the Judge gave me 3 mo.. to see if I can get Re-finance, that did not work, then after paying this lawyer money i had to barrow from my family he told me he could not helo me anymore..I got anohtre real estate to rty and help they blinked me out of all the little money I had left..Until people walk in your shoe they can talk.. The president is right because when there is a lot of housed closed up by your property it worth nothing, so for those people who are so high and mighty because they can still pay their mortgage let some houses closed get closed up by their property, theirs will go down,, Mr. President you will not fail, this is wht the Republicans want you to do but God never fails///

Everyone wake up and smell the roses.

I’m not on anyones side. What I have seen people in America do is get greedy, lazy and forget about God until they need him. I’m not a religous freak, but I do believe. I believe first of all getting spankings back into our schools. That would help our teachers and education out extremely. Students will start to listen. Bring GOD back as a whole Country. Not let anyone tells us we can’t take God out of anything because that is the reason America is or was so great. America must fall once again as a Nation to become a stronger America. Like the last depression that took over 14 yrs. to come out of. People need to stand up for what our for fathers did.
The back bone of America is the poor and middle class. There must be a way of preventing all our jobs from leaving. Put Taxes on incoming shipments and give the companys that stay in the USA a tax credit.
I see people lossing there homes that they bought at $270,000 and now are worth $75,000. Now way do you need a house at that price??? Did they ever think about not being able to pay for it?? Those people shouldn’t get help due to stupidity.

The House bill provides $4 billion per year to reward states to increase their TANF caseloads; the Senate bill follows the same policy but allocates less money. Change you can be dependent on!

And how about you ask US if we are willing to pay the debt. All I ask is that there is plan to pay it off, I don’t mind really what it takes, so long as their is a plan.

ROSE BERNARD-CARRUTH–When you lost your job in 1999 and your home was foreclosed on, I’m sure that somehow, some way it was Bill Clinton’s fault, just like those who are losing their homes now have only G. Bush (not themselves) to blame).
But when the government didn’t pick you up from that fall, didn’t pay for your house or intercede with the bank, in the end, wouldn’t you say you became stronger from that experience? Even if you lost your home? What followed the 1999 recession was a period of growth–most people prospered throughout much of the period of 2000 through 2007–so many so that most thought there would be no end. they were buying and selling so many houses with no regard to the future, taking out risky loans to finance their agenda.

Mr. U -
Um, yes, your elected officials were in fact asked about the cost of the war in Iraq and even though you might have been too young to vote, I’m sure your congressmen and senators (who voted on the war) would have loved to have heard your comments. This is a democracy, you don’t have to be asked for your opinion–just shout it out–offer it anyway. Call your congressmen, senators, etc. and let them know how you feel. That’s what they get paid for.
All representatives of Congress and the US Senate were asked their opinion on the war. They all voted and hopefully when they voted, they had your welfare and that of all their constituents in mind.

As a community organizer, our president was aware of what was going on with the people he served and tried to help. The reason( I believe ) so many bloggers on this site have a problem with him is they find it hard to beleive that people can want to do something to help others. Our president is optimistic and realistic. So many people that disagree with him are narcissistic and pessimistic. There is real hurt and there are real stories of people struggling to keep their homes, jobs and feed their families. Bravo Mr. President for hearing their stories! It is encouraging to know that you want to stay aware of what is going on with the citizens of this country. You are a follower of Christ’s teachings and it shows.Continue your efforts.

I don’t feel sorry for these people that bought homes that cost 500,000 and they only make 50,000 a year. Did you honestly think that you could afford that? Banks did not decieve people. Chances are you leveraged yourself out and didn’t think. Hmm geez what could happen if A) I loose my job or B) hmm the variable rate would go up. The only people that are getting the shaft are the people whom work hard and barely make ends meet. We are rewarding bad behavior and weaking this country.

It is interesting to read all these comments. It appears we all are professional political pundits, and economists of the highest caliber.
It also appears that only people from this blog know how to fix the economy.
This is the time to be united and support our government. If things dont turn arround, you can vote out the current policymakers teh next election.
The most important thing for Dem or Republicans is that if everyone supports (even with disagreements) the economic recovery may be faster.
I don’t see the Republicans and some Dems doing this. It seams they want to make it even harder for the President to apply the fix. In this scheme no politician will suffer, it will only be you and me.

Where does it say that you have to sell your house for more than you bought it?
Is there some law somewhere that says it?
If your current house price is lower than you paid for it, then live in it longer.
In the 1980s, a friend in California bought a home for $125,000. Ten years later the Air Base closed and her house was now selling for $64,000. Did the govt. bail her out? No, they lived in it and sold it 15 years later for just under $100,000.
Did she whine for help? Nope, that is the breaks she said. And after all she lived in the house for 25 years and once you count the cost of the house plus mortgage payments minus the selling price she figured it cost her about $500 a month to live in the house. Cheaper than renting apartments were in the area.
Again I ask the question:
Where does it say that you have to sell your house for more than you bought it?

What surprises me is the people who are putting President Obama down by saying he is playing God, are ranting and raving because he is not solving all the problems as only God can do. Am I the only one who sees a contradiction here? Shut up and let the President do his job–that is why he is in office. If all the negative people actually do have the answers here, whey did they not run, and why did the Republicans not win? He is simply trying to clean up the Republican mess which takes awhile as Bush’s taxes and mess are still in running for 2009.

MM I agree with some of the comments about governors being uneasy about accepting addition monies that will create a burden down the road. What about the burden that is at hand now? There are many, how did you put it oh yea (producing population of their states) that are loosing or have lost there jobs. Which i guess makes them non producers at this time? With the job market that way it is. Should we just write these people off MM? Some of these people have lived within there means myself included. We are living off our savings and have watched our 401k’s go south .. You said I should. Think more intelligently and use the brain God gave me. It is difficult to do that MM when you have about 6 months of savings left and no light at the end of the tunnel that can be seen at this time. So if i seem kinda down on the political quagmire that we call Government I am sorry. I blame the situation that the USA is in now on to much Gov, there are so many dept that have been created that one cannot communicate with the other without getting things convoluted or in the case of the SEC dropping the ball period. A perfect example would be Markopolos trying to deliver the largest Ponzi scheme in history to the SEC. I will survive I always have. Good luck to you MM, may life always hand you exactly what you deserve. I commend President Obama for attempting to put a band aide on this mess he has inherited.. I really believe he cares about your average Joe and Jane..

I wonder how many letters he is presented that appose his massive spending spree,or is it all sad stories that he can use as propoganda at his“town hall meetings”.When Obama went to Denver and Phoenix to sell his spending bill,there were many protestors saying“NO”to the“stimulus”and the media ignored it.All the American people were shown were Obama’s followers,cheering with glee as he prepared to pass the largest spending measure in American history.I would like to hear from americans like myself,who are not concerned wealthy by the presidents standards,will receive a measly $13 a week in tax benfits,drive two cars over 12 years old,pay by mortgage and bills on time and am responsible with my finances.Our government is NOT RESPONSIBLE to bail out those who have bought houses they cannot afford and we should not give any bail out money to Fanny and Freddie who helped cause this mess to begin with.Obama,Pelosi and Reid are rewarding the idiots who wasted our money in the first place.

These blogs are really eye-opening, especially someone who has 2 homes and can’t sell or rent one of their homes, due to the economy issue, believes that they should be entitled to help from Uncle Sam because they are working. Give me a break, but let’s help those who have no jobs, and those who have one home or no home first. People in this 2-home owner situation should assess their financial position and make the changes necessary to stay financially afloat, not expect the government to support their risky financial adventures.

Window dressing. Propaganda. Of course he does read the letters, but what makes anyone think the other Presidents didn’t read letters either? Of course the staff is going to pick the most touch and heart rending letters. Watch out that they aren’t taken in like Oprah Winfrey. Of course the letters are solidly behind the current President. You think those staffers are going to show him anything else? Those staffers want to keep their jobs. Would the President even look at letters that weren’t all gooey and gushy about him. Not any Presidents I recall, from Ike to Obama. This is proganda people. See it for what it is.

I certainly feel for the people who are in a bind these days, there always some when things go south and the sotries are the same. Yet he seems to be ignoring a much larger pecentage of the country who rent in order to save a tiny minority who are in over their head.
Dear Mr. President,
I see where you are considering a housing plan that would allow homeowners to stay in their over priced, ill financed homes, by allowing them to rent the home from the bank and hopefully buy the home back from the bank at some point in the future. I can certainly see and respect the motivations of your plan.
However, I am troubled by any plan which keeps homes off the market and delays or worse yet, forestalls any amelioration in home prices. As I am sure you have been told by your economic advisors, the disparity between personal incomes and home prices are at or near all time highs. So is the disparity between costs of renting and home ownership. Home price appreciation is vastly ahead of historical trends. I believe that it is essential to a healthy economy for these costs and prices to adhere to historical trends and be in relative equilibrium with respect to affordability. Past housing booms have been ended by a return to pre-boom pricing levels, adjusted for inflation. If these homes are not returned to the market there will be no end to the bubble and I, along with millions of others who did not make the mistake of taking a bad loan on an over priced home will forever be denied the American dream.
All of that said, I believe that your intentions are altruistic and I would understand if you felt it was essential to forsake the American dream of millions of savers who did not buy an over priced home with flim flam style loan, in order to save millions of people who made a bad investment on a home during the latter part of the bubble cycle. The only things I would ask for are these … First, an acknowledgement that renters like myself are being told to take one for the team. Second, since I watched you on TV, take an oath to uphold the Constitution, I would like an explanation as to why someone else’s pursuit of happiness is worth more to you than mine and that of other renters in this country.
Sincerely,
A Taxpayer

I keep hearing people complain about this bill the President just signed. Why complain about this bill because either way the government is spending money either they help people stay in their homes and keep their jobs or they are subsidizing their living in section 8 homes and giving them money through the ADC programs, Unemployment, food stamp and other programs for those without. So to me it would be better to use my tax dollars to help those who want to work keep their jobs and those who can pay for their homes with a little help right noe then to end up using my tax dollars taking care of in those programs.

Re me, who says“anon–When someone who can’t afford their house loses that house, it is someone else’s gain (usually a small investor or a middle class family looking to move up or subsidize their income by buying rental property).”
No, often nowadays the houses sit derelict and become havens for drug dealers who terrorize the neighbors and drive down their property values.

I have to assume that most of the snide comments on this blog are written by Republicans? People who talk about‘sad stories’as though everyone with a sad story is some sort of trailer-trash, welfare-trash, money-grubbing trash, piece of TRASH non-human—what is the matter with you people? Are you so bitter you have forgotten how to relate to another person’s misfortune? Are you so paranoid that you can’t believe anyone else’s misfortune couldn’t possibly be anything but their own fault because RUSH L tells you so? (L is for loser, by the way). I really feel sorry for people who feel this way. You all need treatment and drugs for your paranoia and/or depression. I have no idea whether other presidents read 10 letters/day written to him by the public. So what? Are you so paranoid you can’t say this is a good thing that Obama does it without having to make the comparison? It’s not like the guy doesn’t have the biggest mess in the history of the planet to try to clean up. Give the guy a break.

Two ideas to ponder for the next stimulus plan
1) Give each household a full tax credit equal to the filer’s previous year mortage interest or rent expense. You can spin it as a tax cut, you can spin it as putting money into the pockets of middle america. It comes out to about $20K per household.
This will help people who have a mortgage whether they are delinquent or current buy down their mortgage by a sizeable amount. It allows renters to have extra cash for the down payment on a home. And it infuses cash into the economy, as people will either pay down their mortgage or put it in the bank or spend it
2) Allow everyone to reset the mortage on their primary residence at the lower of their current rate or 5% by infusing cash into fannie and freddy so they can refinance these mortgages. This takes all the risky mortgages off the market and into the government’s hands and allows the banks balance their portfolio

I would love to write a letter to President Obama. There are a lot of people suffering right now and my family has been effected terribly by this economy. My husband became very ill in Oct 07 was misdiagnosed for 3.5 months before requiring surgery on 1/10/08&amp;returned to work Feb 1,08. After all that his employer“found a reason”to let him go&amp;he’s been unemployed ever since. Applying to well over 300 jobs this past year with no luck whatsoever. No job is beneath him but we’ve heard all the reasons (over qualified, under qualified&amp;that’s even if he gets a response). In the meantime I have had to support my family on my income alone which has not been easy being my husband was the“bread winner”of our family of 5. In the meantime we’ve drained what little savings we had and to top that my employer cut my hours by mid June as well. So I was forced to find another full time job to make ends meet. Fortunately I was lucky enough to find a job in TN but now had to leave my family in FL behind and we’ve lived apart for 4 months. So we are now faced with trying to sell our home in FL in a troubled housing market losing all of our equity that we had built over the past several years..only to be told if it sells we may break even…basically walking away with only our belongings. I miss my family terribly but this is what I must do to avoid foreclosure.

Thanks to the government meddling. If the economy were to rebound naturally, it would spur investing. It always does.
Of course there are lots of abandoned properties all over the country, and yes, they have become havens for the homeless and for the drug dealers–but that’s when neighbors need to unite and find creative solutions to solving these problems (not wait for the government to step in and solve the problem). I live in a Phoenix suburb that was left with hundreds of half built homes when the builder went out of business and our neighborhood took steps (by working with police, Community Watch, etc.) to make sure drug dealers didn’t take over the neighborhood–all it takes is neighbors who care.
Few things are ever really solved when we wait for the government to come to the rescue. What we end up with is just a band-aid–and that’s all this housing bill is–a band-aid.

At least President Obama is trying to do something to correct the situation.Even if some of it doesn’t work at least he is trying.

Okay, All this talk about foreclosures is enough. I have a very simple solution. For each month someone is behind on their mortgage, the bank should just let them add on their payments to the end of their loans. For example: If I am Suzy Homemaker, I am six months behind on my mortgage and I am unemployed. Let suzy put the six months she is behind onto the back of her mortgage. Give her six months without payments (so she can find a job) So now Suzy is 12 months behind in her payments. She has a 3o year mortgage. If the bank let’s her move those payments to the back of her loan, she now has a 31 year mortgage. Suzy stays in her home, and the bank gets all of the money it is owed. No government spending needed. This plan can also work with car payments. No government intervention needed. Why can’t it be as simple as this???

Glenn,
Inflating the money by another 700 billion dollars isn’t a“detail”, it’s a massive continuation of the same mistakes that Bush made, and that FDR and Hoover made back in the 1930s.
We are going through the crash that invariably follows an inflationary bubble. Inflation is not a solution to the problems caused by inflation. If it were possible to“stimulate”an economy this way, we’d be hailing Robert Mugabe as a genius, and Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth.

Send out the US marshals, throw those criminals into secret dungeons, let their attorneys try to find them. Cushy Jailtime is too good for them considering the damage they did to our nation, and for which they have yet to answer.
It is only a few individuals who made this disaster we are experiencing. Let’s arrest them, get rid of them and confiscate the enormous wealth they amassed. It belongs to the U.S. Treasury. Take away their millions and billions, let their kids attend public schools and scrimp to buy clothes at WalMart.

First of all allow me to commend President Obama for attempting to clean up a mess he inherited. In response to Charity..Let me ask how much time did you give President Bush to create this mess? 8 years if recall correctly. You can not clean up a eight year old mess in one month. Secondly how many measly dollars did you receive a week in tax benefits during the Bush Adminsitration?
Zero if I recall correctly. I do not agree with bailing out all of these Homeowners who went on spending sprees and now want the tax payers to bail them out. Question/Statement for Presidnet Obama, how about enacting a law especailly in the State of California who was 42B in the hole and
pays more rent then any other State in the Country. There are Certain cities in California which have Rent Control and some do not all cities need to have Rent Control and a freeze on raising rent during this recession/difficult times. The renters in this state need to be given some condireation not just the homeowners.

I am very impressed that within less than 2 weeks the issue was addressed and corrected more favorably than I expected. I have worked in the local government as a financial analyst and I have held many other positions. This is one of the FASTEST turn arounds ever in comparision to how long it takes to correct issues brought into other companies or schools. God bless, Heather

Are you saying he should go medieval on the likes of Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, and Madelene Waters.. they are the one’s who refused in 2004 to fix the looming problems.. but since they are Dems and not part of the Bush administration, I am guessing that NO ONE will get medieval on them…

Congress in 1998 removed teh restrictions on mortgages, Clinton signed it.. in 2004 republicans blew teh whistle about the looming crisis to Barney Frank who was the chair of the commerse committee that was charged with keeping an eye on the mortgage industry.. He, alone with Dodd, and Waters all slammed the republicans for sounding the alarm.. (google“Barney Frank denies”and watch the 2004 Cspan video of the congressional hearings if your don’t believe me). This was not a problem created by the bush administration.. It was created by democrats who forced lenders to push sub prime (bad) loans on people who should never have been approved.. all int he name of“housing opportunities”for lower income and minority families..
Now we have a president who has increased the deficit in 2 months by almost as much as bush increased it in 8 years.. all on“stimulus”spending that will NOT stimulate the economy…wake up.. We are headed for disaster that was created by democrats trying to build a power base among those dependent on the government and now we have a president who is extending that process by increasing the welfare stae on the backs of taxpayers, our children and grandchildren…

Sondra, Why would any bank want to do that? Why would I, as an investor, want to invest in a bank that allowed a debtor to stop making payments for six months or a year all in the hopes that they’ll make it up at the end? Just imagine what it would do to the bank’s payroll if 20 percent or 30 percent or even 5 percent of its borrowers decided to go a few months without paying their mortgages–it would drive the bank out of business or at the very least make the stock plummet (don’t you care about the small time investors who have their retirement in the stock market?)!
If the homeowner signed a contract vowing to pay a certain amount EVERY month–they should be required to fulfill their obligation or lose their property. For goodness sake–it’s not that hard! It’s business. when someone takes out a loan, other people’s lives are wrapped up in that loan–everyone from bank tellers employed at the bank to granny, who owns 200 shares in the bank.

Sondra, allowing home buyers to just tack on six months of mortgage payments at the end of their 30-year loan goes against every rule of responsible homeownership. Home buyers are taught to do the opposite–pay extra every month to avoid trouble and pay off a loan sooner, not later. homeowners who can’t do that don’t deserve to be in their homes. Banks are businesses–they have employees and investors and bills of their own–they’re not charities.

DIANE posted ARE THE PEOPLE ON SSI OF SS GETTING A CHECK I HEARD WE WHERE GETTING A CHECK PLEASE LET ME KNOW WE WHERE GOING TO BE GEETING A CHECK FOR 250 IS THAT TRUE…………..
I agree, i am on SSI and get 650.00 a month, plus a 92.00 in foodstamps. I would love to get a check or better yet a loan that i could affored to pay with what i pay my rent with. I pay 200.00 a month rent, plust utlities and other bills, this takes up almost all of my check (590.00) leaving me 60.00 for stuff my food stamps cant buy, gas for my van so i can go to apointments, copays at the docs office, the new part D eats up another 20.00 because congress forced it down our throats. I used to pay nothing for meds, now i do, i know 20.00 is not a lot, but when you live on 650.00 a month it eats a big chunk out of it also i maybe will be able to get a cheese burger from mcdonalds once a month. The disabled need a boost in income, like 200.00 a month and the goverment needs to slap the FS peopls hands. Do you know that when we get our yearly increase (usually 10-20.00) they cut that much in food stamps. Incresse my butt, As to the home owners loosing thier homes, they need to look at the situation. If you didnt over due it. But are loosing your home because you lost your job, and other items that could be the reason, then yes they need help, but to the ones who just kept spending and spending when they should have been paying it off.
The best way to fix it, (morgage) take the amounts that they own and havent paid, tack it onto the end of the loan, and let them stay in their homes. Then get rid of the rotating amounts you pay and give them a fixed rate. They both win, the homeowner keeps their home, and the banks get paid.

Dear Mr. President,
Please help me. I do not own a home, I buy cars used for cash and do not carry a credit card balance. I have worked a majority of my life and forgone many pleasure by choosing not to go into debt.
Over the past 8 years I worked hard and saved my money. I didn’t go to college, never studied economics, but due to COMMON SENSE I knew that the realtors, mortgage brokers and politicians were clueless about this now evident bubble. I thought “If I behave responsibly and prepare for when the correction takes place I can by a house too”
Well apparently I was wrong. I should have purchased that house for an inflated price and now be belly aching about the payments, calling ACORN to help me stay in my home illegally. Supporting a stimulus plan for me, me, me. This is America, it is not about me it is about us, but not your socialist us, or I pay for you us, it is about brotherly love and helping your neighbor by choice.
Frankly Sir, this is the portion of the United Stated that is too big to fail. Who is going to pay all these new taxes and fees due to the stimulus? How is this sustainable for a future generation? How will I be able to buy a home if you and the FED continue to artificially keep the prices inflated and interest rates low? All the while helping the people who were too greedy or too stupid to make a rational decision? This does not make sense.
I admit that I did not vote for you, but you promised that you would make a believer out of me. You said you were going to reach across the isle and unit our country. Now all I hear about is ammo running out and people are scarred as to how you are reshaping America. I am uncomfortable with your plan to reward greed and stupidity but I guess it is all part of the plan.
I beg of you, prove me wrong. Show the American people that you are looking out for the long term best interest of the Country. Show the Democrats that you are compassionate with there cries to assist the less fortunate and the Republicans that you are not going to shove government down their throats. Mr. Obama, show me that you care about this great country and the people who live within its borders. Show me by allowing the same freedom my family has enjoyed since we fought to free ourselves from the British and stand on our own feet.
Sent to President Obama 2/23/09. I hope I am one of the 10.

I think that President Obama is doing an amazing job, While everyone is trying to resist him because of personal issues, They tend to forget that the previous administration got us into this mess and swept everything under the rug. President Obama is“spring cleaning”and now everything is comming to light. President Obama has been in office for a little over a month and look what he is trying to impliment already, before the man even took office he was on the job. I think we all need to support and applaude his efforts, bare in mind that President Obama is not the Mesiah, so stop looking for him to put a bandaid on the world and solve everything. Stop thinking about me and think like he does for the greater good of mankind.

You do realize, don’t you, that Sarah Palin was NOT running for President? I really hope you didn’t think that and if you did, I hope you didn’t vote. It scares me how many uninformed people voted.

Response to Another Point of View,
First of all you must be a Republican, let me ask you a question, who was the President of the Unitd States prior
to January 20,2009 for the past eight years?(President Bush) and where all eyes closed while this mess with the
ecomony was becoming a widespread problem for the Nation. As far as the Clintion Administration goes we did not have a deficit, nor were we at War and people were not losing their homes and jobs at an alarming rate. Apperantly someone took their eyes off the ball as you say, however, it was not the Obama Administration. e-mail me back in eight years!
How are your going back to the Clintion

The best way to fix it, (morgage) take the amounts that they own and havent paid, tack it onto the end of the loan, and let them stay in their homes. Then get rid of the rotating amounts you pay and give them a fixed rate. They both win, the homeowner keeps their home, and the banks get paid.

Wanda–I did not mention either Bush or Clinton in my comments. I did not place blame or bring politics into the conversation.
I said that homeowners should be required to pay their debts as they agreed when they signed their mortgage contracts. The bank is a business. It requires that borrowers make payments on time every month so that it can pay its employees and keep its stockholders happy.
It doesn’t take a republican to know that and that you bring politics into a conversation about homeowner responsibility says more about you and your political leanings then it does about me.

Mr President:
Living in SW VA is not an easy task, especially having‘no choice’ballots, and not be truly REPRESENTED in the House of Congress. Not having a voice, not being heard, and being ignored by your Representative in the House, truly Jars my preserves!
Congressman Bob Goodlatte, ignores Constitutents, and force feeds them on his agenda and Rhetoric in any plea you render to him regarding his hard nose approach in representing his Party and his ideologues. I have been disconnected by his staff, if my dissent is not in concurance with his way of voting and his approach to what concerns me as a Citizen, with the RIGHT to disagree with his stance on a law.
Sir, as someone who knows and loves what my Country used to be, I know it is my DUTY to disagree and complain with those whom I believe has lead our Country on the road to distruction. To not be heard, to not be represented, to not be listened to, rankles my last years of life in my country. At 73, I should be respected as a Senior Citizen, as a one who knows what my country is capable of, and I resent being disrespected by an insipid Congressman.
Goodlatte has NEVER gotten my vote, and like his counterpart Virgil Goode, he will be voted out of office, because of his dogma and insurection and obstructive views.
YES, this one voted for that one, and PROUD OF IT! THEY HAVE GOT TO GO!
P. S. Tell the First Lady, to get rid of the YELLOW BRICK ROAD RUG, that the Wizard of Oz, left in the Oval Office, it has bad Kharma, and needs to be removed from your presence, because you have PRESENCE sufficient to suffice.

William, please enlighten me–how does a bank, its employees or its investors benefit when a homeowner decides to change the terms of its signed contract and pay in 31 years instead of 30? When buying a house, a borrower signs a contract agreeing to pay a certain amount every month. Paying on time is an obligation. If the homeowner is not required to fulfill their obligations to the bank, why should the bank fulfill its obligation to the homeowner?

Pure populist propaganda…
I, for one, am getting tired of hearing how when people“who have played by the rules”or“who have done nothing wrong”deserve to be bailed out or to have pity placed upon them. Call me cold-hearted if you will, but I don’t agree. If you lose your job and then your home is foreclosed upon then perhaps you have done something wrong:
- Perhaps you should have chosen a profession where you would be less vulnerable to a lay-off
- Perhaps you should have saved more money to have in case a job loss were to occur
- Perhaps you should have bought a less expensive home
- etc., etc., etc.
My point here is that we all make choices in life and sometimes things happen in life that are“not fair.”That’s life–Upon suffering a set-back you pick yourself up and get back at it.
Americans have become a nation of self-entitled whiners beholden to government ever-so-happy to play the role of Nanny.

Another Point of View, you sound quite naive. Do you really think that only the homeowners will take a hit in this economy? You can’t get blood from a turnip, and ANY bank (and its shareholders) would rather it get SOME $$ than no money at all. Forget people taking on loans they KNEW UPFRONT that they couldn’t afford (lied about their income–lazy/minority Democrats, as so many Repubs assume); forget further, the flip side of that coin, those duped by predatory lenders to buy more than they could afford, as if either group *necesarily* made up the *majority* of those foreclosing. Assume everything was above board on both sides–homeowner and lender, just for a moment. ALL of these loans are predicated on a certain mount of income to be able to pay, which can’t be done if job is lost and any replacement job is at less income. Your post is like a child condemning a deceased parent for breaking a promise to always take care of them, when they’re suddenly killed. It’s ludricous to expect nothing to change as far as honoring the commitments of a loan, if income circumstances change BEYOND ONE’S CONTROL. And, those lucky enough to be currently still able to make payments/still employed the same as before will see their equity go, as other homes foreclose in their neighborhoods. Develop compassion for those whose situations you do not know…

Rider1A, if you think Obama is a“Marxist”president, the you dont have the faintest idea what“Marxist”means. Most people who have claimed that he is a“socialist”president don’t know what“socialist”means either.
We’re dealing with a nation of undereducated, underinformed men and women who haven’t the faintest idea of how to define“Marxist”or“socialist”; they don’t even recognize that their own Social Security and Medicare benefits are all ABOUT the same sort of“soft socialism”that Europeans enjoy. I find myself utterly dispirited and disheartened by the sheer ignorance and stupidity of my own, fellow Americans. How unbelievably dumb and badly informed can you all be?
I like to think that most Americans graduate from high school these days; but perhaps most of my fellow citizens are all 8th-grade dropouts? And are therefore too ignorant to have any idea what the obsolete“Marxism”once meant and what“socialism”means now? Are you all REALLY that moronic?
Because let me assure you: the“conservative”pundits are VERY highly educated, and they are using you, the people who DIDN’T attend Harvard, Yale, Penn, and Dartmouth. You are their fodder, their audience. They are enjoying taking advantage of your lack of education and your ignorance. That’s their job.

I’m glad that Obama is reading letters to keep in touch with ordinary people and their problems. It is too easy for a president to become insulated from the‘common folk’.
ginger’s advice is excellent. Read the bill yourself and then decide if it makes sense. To me, the housing mess is a huge part of the economic problem. So lessening the number of foreclosures will not only be good for those individuals who qualify but will help all of us by stabilizing prices.

Sir;
I somehow turned out to be a“Republican for Obama”, which so far still feels like the right thing to have done. But I do have some small suggestions;
1. If the pouting Republicans don’t want to join the revolution, take a page from FDR and JFK, communicate directly with the people. God knows you have the technology, and no news outlet is going to dare turn you down. If half of the government wants to sit on their duffs licking their wounds, let them. Let’s move on !!!
2. I and my familly wholeheartedly agree with the need for massive govertnment intervention into our financial institutions and key Industries, but I would like to see you folks setting the parameters and nationalizing the banks, and those favored Industries until we are back on track as a nation. This has been done repeatedly in Europe and around the world when necessary and it has worked well as long as the politicians have not retained control beyond the time that was necessary to revitalize the economy. And however it’s done, we need regulations and safeguards to protect the people from Corporate and Political GREED!!! And this time they need to be REAL.
3. And last but definitely not least, before I die I would really like to see a national health care program in this country that measures up to the power and wealth of this nation. It’s truely embarrassing that all of the G-7 Countries and our Canadian allies to the north can find the resources to provide minimal health care for their citizens, but all we can do is build more Stealth Bombers and Trident subs.
If you ever see this I hope you aren’t depressed; but I live in a state where fat, greedy, sleazey politicians couldn’t pass a budget until one honest man ( a Republican from Monterey County) swam against the tide.
Maldonado and Arnold S. are two people I would vote for no matter which ticket they ran on.

“Some recent examples, according to aides, include a letter from a businessman who owns a manufacturing company and says he finds it very difficult to lay off employees who have done nothing wrong. If things don’t improve, the correspondent wrote, he’ll have to lay off 10% of his workforce.”
I hope someone tells that businessman that when he lays people off, he should start with Obama voters.

Chester White, what I find amazing is that you are apparently so blinded by your love of the Republican party to realize that the issues that the country is going through TODAY were put in place by the last 8 years of cronyism and incompetence at the highest levels of both business and government. Being angry at those who voted for Obama is like being angry at the rain for getting your shoes wet—given the situation, it was bound to happen. I realize that conservatism is all about maintaining the status quo, but when the status quo is leading millions of people to ruination, change is guaranteed to happen.

Dear President Obama,
Are you aware of what the insurance companies in this country are doing? They kick you when you are down. Due to my son’s credit score they are increasing his home owner’s insurance even though they received their money every year. This increase will push him over and may now lose his home because he just can’t afford it. He works hard and has struggled to keep his home and now lets increase his mortgage payment due to a credit score that the insurance company does not like. This also has happened to me as well. Due to my low credit score they have increased my auto insurance by $50 more a month and I have a very good driving record and always made my payments. What does a credit score have to do with your driving record and making your payments? I have just learned that my mortgage payment too will increase because of my credit score so now I am in the same boat as my son. Does this seem right to you?

A lot of people on here are complaining about the fact that a huge federal spending plan will take the economy further down than it already is. You people are sadly misinformed on both economic principles and history. While it is true that we are going through this crash because of an inflationary bubble, we are actually experiencing a period of DEFLATION. Massive government spending will most likely not cause hyperinflation, but slow down or stop the deflation effect. In terms of history, look up Japan’s“lost decade.”The Japaneese people experienced pretty much the same problem we are facing now; a recession caused by a housing crisis and a stock market failure, however, they did not have the huge amounts of unemployment we have. For the first several years they left it alone thinking it would fix itself. Nothing happened, so they implemented a stimulus package which was working until they pulled the plug on it because people were screaming about how the federal defecit was too high. Guess what happened then. THE ECONOMY CRASHED AGAIN!
I guess what I’m saying is before you all get all hot and bothered over this plan, do your research. In fact, you shouldn’t blindly jump on the bandwagon either. Alot of people commenting this article have expressed fear on the amount of uneducated people in this country and i have to say I am one of them.
More on topic of the press release, I think it’s a great idea to SHOW the public he is reading their letters. Even if other presidents did that, how would the general public know? If you feel disconnected to your leader, you can’t provide support and everything just goes down hill.

Perhaps you and your son should have been wiser in your financial choices. Owning a home is not for everybody. Perhaps you both should not have purchased a house with a payment that consumed so much of your incomes. Perhaps you should have been saving money in an emergency fund. If you were unable to save, then you obviously spent too much on your home. Perhaps you lost your job and are in a rough spot. Unemployment lasts for a year now, if that is not long enough to get back on your feet, then I say you are either not trying or too proud to take a lesser job. Maybe you got a lower paying job and can’t keep up with your payments. Maybe you should rent out a room in your house to make up the difference? Maybe you should get a second job, or sell some of your stuff. Maybe you should ask your son or other relatives to move in with you. You have options, explore them.
Call your insurance company and talk to them. Raise your deductible. Lower your coverage amounts. Try a new insurance provider.
Call your mortgage holder and ask for help. Perhaps they can work with you (not likely, but you never know until you try).
When you have done all this and still cannot meet your financial obligations, go back to your mortgage contract and look at the bottom. There you will find the signature of who got you into this mess. You.

Dear Mr. President,

In the past, a mortgage was a loan of money directly invested in a bank. If a mortgage holder had trouble with payments, the bank was *very likely* to work with them and extended the mortgage or adjust the terms.
Now, a mortgage is almost always a loan of money from a Mutual Fund or Investment account. The bank does not have the option of changing the terms, because they would have to contact all the investors in the Fund and ask them to approve it. This would often require contacting hundreds of thousands of people.
The problem is that the government deregulated the separation of Consumer banks and Investment banks. This lead to the“bundling”of mortgages into single giant Funds. This also hid the apparent risk because it was assumed that the risk was mitigated by grouping many loans together. This led banks to lower their lending requirements and issue ever more risky loans.
The investors, fund managers, banks, and consumers ALL made mistakes. What we need to do now is pass a law giving the banks the power to modify troubled loans, either by extending the length of the loan or by lowering the interest rate, without having to contact all the investors. This would give the banks the chance to help the consumers, to turn troubled loans into reasonable loans. The bank would rather have lower payments than no payments at all. They would have much smaller losses overall, lending would resume again, and the economy would have a chance to recover.

I am tired of people saying that President Obama is not fixing the economic problem. This problem did not just start when he became President. It has been coming for a long time and it is not going to get fix within the President’s first month in office. We need to stop criticizing him for not fixing the problem, when he is trying to come up with a solution that is best for the people at large. The ones that made this mess is trying to cover themselves and place blame on President Obama. We as a people should have been reading and paying attention before now and this problem would not have happened. We need to become proactive instead of reacting to the negative comments from the Republicans. I am behind our President one hundred percent and am looking forward to getting through this and a brighter day is coming. It is going to take some time to get this resolved. Again, it did not happen over night and it is not going to get fixed over night. Pray and move forward.

Lin ann, if people do not have enough savings to continue paying their mortgage for a few months following a job loss, then those people DID in fact take out a loan they couldn’t afford. If they run through their savings and still don’t have another job, well, if they can’t make their payments, they can’t afford their house.
The reality is that most people CAN afford to save their money so that they can survive a job loss and still make their mortgage paymens–they just chose not to, they’d rather spend it instead.

I have my masters, I had a great job and a little more than 35,000 dollars in savings plus I owned a small house and had not too high payments.
Then I was laid off, but I figured I would be okay for a while as I looked for a new job because of my savings. 7 weeks after I got my pink slip, I got something else, a diagnosis of breast cancer. Without insurance (which I lost when I lost my job and was holding off buying privatly thinking that surely I would find a new job) my savings disappeared pretty darn quick. I put my house up for sale two weeks after I got my diagnosis figuring I would eventually not be able to make payments, it has been on the market for 16 months now, my savings are gone and I am about to be foreclosed on.
Oh and I have been trying to get a new job, in the middle of my treatments—have you ever been to a job interview while sick and bald and scary looking–hiring managers look at you with pity but they don’t hire you.
To all of you out there judging those who are being foreclosed on, saying it is their own fault and chastising them, think to yourself“there by the grave of god go I”you are only ever one catastrophy away from being in their place. Use those christian teachings you like to shout at others, love your neighbor and help those in need, you never know how close you are to having the bottom fall out until it does

Fantastic! Obama is truly a king in the PR realm.
I am happy to hear that Obama tries to listen to ordinary people. Listening is the basis of public relations.
But I will be happier if Obama can listen to “ORDINARY” people who have not been ‘intentionally’ screened by his officers. Understanding the “public” not “selected people” is the most important component of public relations.
I will be much happier if Obama can make policies to best meet the publics’ needs. This is why I believe the President, a PR person, listens to people.
By the way, Mr. President, the photo on this post looks too artificial. I mean that I can smell perfumes of a PR person in your office. As a PR practitioner, if I can write a letter, I will say “the best PR is PR that goes unnoticed.”
Let’s keep in touch. We all hope that we can make ‘long-term’ relationship.
Jake, we hope that this post is not just a PR story. Please keep us informed that the President is really LISTENING to us.

Natalie F–I don’t think people are judging those who are in foreclosure just pointing out the reality that there are worse things in the world then foreclosure. As a cancer survivor, I’m sure you are aware of that. People survive bankruptcy and foreclosure all the time–they always have–foreclosure is not a new thing. Most people who go through foreclosure come back stronger and some are able to even buy another house years later.
Foreclosure is a safety net for both the bank and the home buyer–it’s not a punishment for not paying your mortgage. Sometimes foreclosure is the best option. Regardless of the circumstance, staying in a house that you can’t afford doesn’t benefit anyone–being house poor is no fun and there’s no shame in renting!
The media only tells us the foreclosure horror stories–they’re not telling you the stories of people doing voluntary foreclosure–pocketing their mortgage payments for months then turning in the keys and walking away with cash.
Again, sometimes foreclosure is the best way to end a bad situation. It means losing one home, but in most cases, you simply move onto another. I rented for years–it wasn’t traumatic for either me or my kids–as a matter of fact, when we finally moved into a house, the kids missed the pool, tennis courts and fitness center at our old apartment complex!
I wish you the best of luck in your cancer recovery.

“It’s like you opened bank pamphlet for how to survive tough times. I think poeple just say crap on here just to annoy people with good sense.”Posted by: Mike Z
Saving for tough times is what people are supposed to do when they buy a house! It’s common sense. Maybe you can see into the future and know with certainty that you’ll never hit hard times, but not me, so I’d rather be prepared! It’s what we counsel all homeowners to do and if more people did it, and if banks required it, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation right now. And yes, most people CAN save their money, but they choose to spend it. Spending an hour or two in Target or Wal-Mart and looking at what people actually buy shows how true that is!
And if I sound like a bank pamphlet, there’s actually a very good reason for that.

To Natalie:
Sorry to hear of your problems and I wish you well in battling cancer.
I would venture that you HAD the option of continuing your former employer’s health care with COBRA (if they employee more than 20 people, they are required to offer it–if they did not, I suggest you contact a lawyer).
But your situation is the exception, not the norm. Most people losing their homes did not have a catastrophic medical situation. Most people simply GAMBLED that the housing market would continue to increase and bet that they could buy and sell for a profit. They mortgaged beyond their means, trying to make a larger profit. The banks certainly gambled and took advantage, also looking to make a profit (from loan fees).
Many people could see that it would not last forever, I sold my house near the peak and have been renting since. I plan to purchase this summer during the low and outright own a house.
Many people see owning a home as a status symbol, as a statement that you are successful. This was because banks used to only give loans to financially stable, successful people with a significant deposit. It used to be impossible to get a loan without a 20% deposit. A 20% deposit proved that you had the ability to be responsible with money. That 20% was the safety net for the bank.
I have no empathy for those that took out 90-103% loans from a bank and now find themselves near foreclosure. I have no empathy for banks that loaned to people without a safety net.
I do have empathy for your situation Natalie, is there a charity or fund setup to help you?

@ Mark: Actually, most home foreclosures happen because of unexpected medical bills that require attention. Being alive&gt;Having a place to keep your things.

until companies understand that the US has to do more than consume products–they need to manufacture them–we are all in trouble. the plant where i work building computers is closing soon after several layoffs. this continues to happen putting more money in the pockets of the“investors”(CEO’s) so until shareholders turn on the boards nothing will change.

Mr. President,
As a part of your plan to control (and hopefully lower) the cost of health–please review the below and have your appropriate Cabinet Member–investigate.
Thank you and God Bless–we are with you.
Especially for special friends who consume too many drugs–and especially
for the attention of our President as he has vowed to look into the high cost of health care.
And thank you Sharon L. Davis who has done a wonderful job of exposing the greed of the drug
industry.
Yes, I agree that research is required for development of new medicines–but, perhaps there needs
to be more regulation with oversight and enforcement.
Go get‘em Mr. President

This is very interesting and I hope you all read it to the end and then pass it on!
Make sure you read to the end. You will be amazed.
Let’s hear it for Costco! (This is just mind-boggling!)
Make sure you read all the way past the list of the drugs. The woman that signed below is a Budget Analyst out of federal Washington , DC offices.
Did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active ingredient in prescription medications? Some people think it must cost a lot, since many drugs sell for more than $2.00 per tablet. We did a search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active ingredients found in drugs approved by the FDA. As we have revealed in past issues of Life Extension a significant percentage of drugs sold in the United States contain active ingredients made in other countries. In our independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really make, we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the most popular drugs sold in America
Celebrex:100 mg
Consumer price (100 tablets): $130.27
Cost of general active ingredients: $0.60

Since the cost of prescription drugs is so outrageous, I thought everyone should know about this.
It pays to shop around! This helps to solve the mystery as to why they can afford to put a Walgreen’s on every corner. On Monday night, Steve Wilson, an investigative reporter for Channel 7 News in Detroit , did a story on generic drug prices gouging by pharmacies. He found in his investigation that some of these generic drugs were marked up as much as 3,000% or more. So often we blame the drug companies for the high cost of drugs, and usually rightfully so. But in this case, the fault clearly lies with the pharmacies themselves. For example if you had to buy a prescription drug, and bought the name brand, you might pay $100 for 100 pills.
The pharmacist might tell you that if you get the generic equivalent, they would only cost $80, making you think you are saving $20. What the pharmacist is not telling you is that those 100 generic pills may have only cost him $10!
At the end of the report, one of the anchors asked Mr. Wilson whether or not there were any pharmacies that did not adhere to this practice, and he said that Costco consistently charged little over their cost for the generic drugs.
I went to the Costco site, where you can look up any drug, and get its online price. It says that the in-store prices are consistent with the online prices. I was appalled. Just to give you one example from my own experience I had to use the drug Compazine which helps prevent nausea in chemo patients.
I used the generic equivalent, which cost $54.99 for 60 pills at CVS. I checked the price at Costco, and I could have bought 100 pills for $19.89. For 145 of my pain pills, I paid $72.57. I could have got 150 at Costco for $28.08.
I would like to mention, that although Costco is a‘membership’type store, you do NOT have to be a member to buy prescriptions there as it is a federally regulated substance. You just tell them at the door that you wish to use the pharmacy, and they will let you in.
I am asking each of you to please help me by copying this letter, and passing it into your own e-mail, and send it to everyone you know with an e-mail address.

Dear President Obama,
I am the grandmother of the most beautiful Autistic little girl that you will ever meet. Julianna was diagnosed with Autism around her second birthday. It was one of the darkest if not the most darkest day of my life. My daughter was on the verge of a nervous breakdown from being heartbroken. But God Bless her, she pulled it together and worked every day in getting the help that Julianna needs. She takes horse back riding lessons, swimming lessons and dance lessons. I help her out all I can. Mr. President al of the tihings that Julianna does is theraputic for her muscles. The Autism families need financial help to pay for all of this. My daughter, son in law and the sister of Julianna sacrafice everyday to give her the needs she should and needs to have. How many autistic children are siting in a corner because the parents do not know where to turn. They have no money, no support, nowhere to turn. Please give these parents the tax break that they need to put a little more money in their pockets to help these unfortunate children. My heart is broken. I pray every waken hour for her to have a good day. This is truly one day at a time.
You are truly the hope that we have not had in a long time. Please help the Autism families that need you.
God Bless you.

I have been trying to reach people in the administration regarding the idea I have to help the economy, the country and ourselves.
Start a bond drive, called“Recovery Bonds”. Have it work like the WW11 bonds did, with low denominations that most people can afford. At that time for $18.75 you bought a bond that matured in 10 years to $25.00. For $37.50 you bought a bond that matured to $50.00. Doint this would be a win win situation for all involved. It would bring money into the treasury for the government to use, and would insure savings for the public to use for college costs, or retirement. People know that they cannot just expect Social Security to support them when they age, and know that they need a supplement to keep from poverty in their old age. The people need a safe place to put their savings, since their confidence in banks is badly shaken. And they need to be able to save modest amounts that will not break their budget. The old WW11 War Bonds were very good for all concerned, and continued to pay interest even long after their 10 year maturity. They were given as birthday and graduation gifts, and wedding presents, and I can personally testify how ours came in handy when the baby boom started. Our government needs to borrow from others to accomplish all that is set before us, and it would be patriotic to feel that our“Recovery Bond”purchases were making a contribution to that. I have written of this idea to Barney Frank, Robert Reich, Keith Olberman, and Rachel Maddow, in hope this idea would somehow reach the administration. No action thus far. Please consider this idea fully and thoughtfully. I cannot see how this could lose, and would be willing to do all I can to see it reach the proper people who could get it going.“Buy Recovery Bonds and help your country and yourselves.”Thanks. Rosalyn

Hard times or Reality?
Does the government know that this is not new! The “economic hard times” have been affecting people for years.
What about the single mother who is an expert at “stretching a dollar” because she’s always had to? The mother who works two jobs, to keep a roof over her family’s head, food in their mouth and clothes on their backs. This is the expert of frugal spending. She’s doing it alone, and barely getting by. Supporting her family, being a mother, and often forgets about herself. What about them?
What about the kids who don’t have to give up the “finer things” or sacrifice certain luxuries because they don’t even know what they are? These are the kids who have appreciated every piece of food because some nights they don’t have anything to eat. The same athletes who miss basketball practice because there are holes in their shoes and those are the only shoes that they have. What about them?
What about the wounded war veteran, or the elderly people who are unable to work, and have only enough government assistance to pay their bills. Who’s been worried about the helpless?
What about the college student who was only able to attend school with the assistance of government funding? The student who is trying to get an education and be the first in his or her family to do so. The one whose family is unable to assist in the funding of their education. This student has had it hard for a while. What about the student?
Now the more fortunate people are aware of how some have had to live for years.
I don’t feel that the recession is completely negative. It is making the world aware that not everyone has it easy. Not everyone has luxuries to give up. Not everyone is able to have a job to get laid off from. For some hard times aren’t something new, but have become a way of life. It only is important now that things are being “taken away” from people. What about those that were never fortunate enough to have them?
What attention is being brought to the fact that there are people who have been barely getting by for years? None.

What happend to personal responsability
Im so sick of hearing who’s fault this is . None of you seem to be taking responsability for this alot of these congressmen that got us into this in the past are still puting their pet projects that we can’t aford in and passing it with out looking at any thing. Who is overciting any of them. This is insanity. If i ran my business like this I deserve to fail. I wish what you were doing was the right thing to do. But really I do not beleive you or Congress can get it right. One sen says oh the only reason their trying to get buris out is because hes black. What a bunch of horse hocy. Maybe its because he lied. Another sen said the people don’t care about pork. Duh what planet is this guy from, Holliwood.
And then the AG said were cowards I do not think these people are the type of people that I want telling me whats good for me. And you might think this is being nit picking as you call it.
If I didn’t pay my taxes I go to jail.
And my taxes go to paying all of you and your planes and homes and cars. and all that is happening is Im having more trouble paying my bills because Im paying everyone else bills. The guy who dosn’t want to work sitting on his frount porch drinking beer all day so I can pay for him to go to the store and play the lottery another project of the gov that cost more then its worth. then the cost of ethinal. How much is that costing us. In food cost tranportation cost and energy cost. So you understand their are thousands of thes things that cost us more and don’t work. So you can see why I don’t thing this works. Yall have no skin in the game. You sit up their in fantacy land and make these oh Im going to save the world attitudes. frankly I don’t give a rip what color you are, or what sex you are. yall are seting bad examples for your race when you devide them and give them an excuse to be poor because they are black or red or purple. Im so sick of that being some kind of defence. Life is hard git over it. Thats what happens when your born into a world were lip service is given and their is no responsability for your actions. People do dispicable things.It dosn’t matter what color you are. Im so sick of it. Every blames some one else for their decitions. its bushes fault its the rep faults its them dems fault well yes all of the above get over it already.I don’t know any of you and yes bad things happen. But the eragance you have astounds me that you think you can fix it is just beon me. Gov creats nothing the people create. The Gov works for us . I do not se that hap-pening. Oh you can tell me that it is my patriot duty to help all you want. But I am not going to pay twice to bank of america or gm or crysler or aig. or the housing market. As soon as out of debt I will never deal with these co. again they should have gone down for doing bad business. I imagine they did’t because the Gov had something to do with it. So to save face. You get the drift. If it looks like a duck. You are the Gov. You stood bye and let this happen. so you can’t spin this in your favor. You and congress are all at fault. You failed and continue to fail bye your spin. I yell at the tv when I hear the foolish stuff coming out of yalls mouth. You beleive the people are stupid. Your arrogance astounds me.
Im not sorry for my rant.
The people need to quit putting people up on pedistals. They are people. remember what was said you can fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people all of the time. When you talk about dems or rep you are talking about people they are sapose to represent so think befor you throw around that partasin stuff. You have a great pr guy but he is not a magition to every one. We are being played like a violen. Well Im sure Ill have more rants later. Most of us are paying our credit cards and morgages and taxes. Otherwise you wouldn’t be on your frount porch drinking beer and buying lottery tickets. One more thing if you have to be in a union to do the shoval ready jobs. It seems to me that the states that have unions are not doing so well and the states that arn’t doing well do not have a good fiscal policy and a lot of welfare. You get what you breed. Why are they not called on the carpet for it. Im one of those so called ordinary person.

You are not the president. You are not a senator. You cannot even spell. Please, do not be critical of things you do not understand..our President has done better in the last month than the prior president did in 8 years! I know we are living in very tough times. I am a prime example..I’ve been unemployed since Aug./2007..my retirement savings are down 45-50%..Try living on the unemployment amounts!! But I still have faith in President Obama. He is working hard and he is sincerely trying his best to get things back to normal for America and its people. May God bless him and lead him.

The reason it is mentioned regarding the former administration is because people have begun blaming the current President with what he inherited. Remember he just stated and has hit the ground running. I am so proud of him. He showed so much class when he was attacked by so many. This comes from knowing who you are. Thank you Mr. President Obama for knowing who you are. We in the Christian community are praying for you continuously. May God hook you up with some Holy men of God who hear directed from God. Every King in the Old Testament had a prophet to count on. Ask God to show you the man. He will. When we talk to God, He is hear and answer. Stay encouraged!

And I don’t know what real world he lives in Washington? Im sure Christ wouldn’t spend money he didn’t have and put it on the yolks of others. And Christ wouldn’t be in politics any way.

Why do they not have to pay taxes . Why can we not find out what they really do? I listen the senat hearing and they are just not saying anything. What is there real function When did they come into exitance. What is their real function? How can the Pres put earmarks into a buget and to cover it up just take his name off of it or the vice pres even isn’t that a conflict of interest. And isn’t against the law to pay back suporters of your election with earmarks and tarp funds from tax payers money or is this common plase in the Gov. Or do you have to prove that is what you are doing. Looks Like A Duck.

We the people create Jobs. Not the Gov.
When the Gov interfears with the People who create jobs then the economy suffers. We are the ones who keep banks open we buy cars we invest. The Gov cannot create a job unless we pay for it. When the Gov starts giving money to their favorite charity. They are giving our money to the earmarks. Welfare is not good for anyone. The best thing to do is get out of our way and let us fix the problem. The more they fool with it the more we loose. Let u keep more of our money and it will be ok. Every time Gov gets involved We have to pay higher electric bills more on healthcare we loose our social sacurity(another skam. Tell me any one has Gov every done anything that they haven’t messed up. Im so sick of people thinking Gov is the answer. They are sapose to protect our borders and they can’t do that eather. I need a copy of the constitution to tell you what they are sappose to do. But its in their. No where in their dose it say bail out banks or insurance co. these people did bad business if I ran my business like they did with all the gov interference. Id go down. But it looks like they will be taking me down soon also with all the things they think I need. No thanks I do not want all this help. Leave me alone please. YOUR NOT HELPING SO JUST STOP.

You are delaying the fall of these co. and delaying the pain and recontruction. If you are using our money to help every one on the planet then pretty soon we won’t have any one paying the bills and then what. you will have more of a problem then you had when you let these co. go down in the first place. Let these co. go and new ones will spring up. But you are just taking more and more money out of our pockets to pay for every thing. These things are unsastanable Its been tried and failed. Why do you think you can do this?

Regimes which opress their own people will collaps of their own immorality if you just nudge them in the right direction.
That brings me to welfare it distroys lives this creates a society that knows how to do nothing. Where is the satisfaction in a life like that.
Do you not care about these people or do you think that if you throw money at them they will go away. Thats not very productive. and that is one of the reason socialism dosen’t work. It degrades people to the point of their own distruction.

The dispersment of money was backwards. Instead of giving money to the corp. that caused the problems the money should have been given to the people to pay off all their bills. Payoff home, credit cards, cars or buy a new car. This would have cleared the mortgage problems around the world, stimulated the purchase of new homes. Bailed out the auto corp. if people were told they must buy an American made car with the money. People could also pay their medical bills. The whole country would be in better shape. But things have changed in the USA. The constitution should read“For the Corperations by the Government”“For the People”no longer applies.

If we are inslaved by big government there is not enough money in the world to help any one.
Ive had a hard life from the day I was born there are lots of people out their in a world of hurt. I am a disabled vet.
I get $125.oo from the Va for my broken broken body . I put myself through colage 3 times. The people in Gov what have they done. I sold My home so I could start a small business so they would have a job. Because Ive been unimployd sence 1990. No one whats to hire a person that has disabilities. I have noinsurance. Im too afaid to go to the va hospital. They are socilized medicine and most of them probably pocket the money that goes to them and it happens alot in any buracacy. But because I live in a free country I am alowed to keep trying. Gov dose not want to help any one and they can’t do anything with out our money. Gov just wants to stay in power. And the more they can keep us beholding to them instead of them working to uphold the contitution and our rights to be safe and free. When they medal in things that they have no clue what they are doing they just make things worse. Most of what the economy is doing know is because they have been fiddling with it. They need to get out of the way and let the people do what they do best inovate dream build. Become selfsuffient
we have allways been that way thats how we made this country great. Socialism has never worked all that happens is every one becomes poor and sooner or later that country fails and then their is gangs taken over the gov stays rich and they eat steak and drink champagne. As long as we have breath in our bodies we can try and be good to our neighbors and help others in ways that you can. Gov can never sustain helping with money. We can try to make the best decition we can with the info we have at the time. Alot of countrys do not have what we have and they come here for it. They usually do well because they work hard.
But when working hard is no longer rewarded because the gov takes more of your money to help others that do not work . It becomes harder to work at all because I can sit on my porch and do nothing because I have some one elses money coming to me that worked for it. I not saying any particular person should not be helped. But we have gotten so far intrenched in this idea that gov is going to help . Gov has no money and getting money you didn’t work for is taking the dignity from this country. Churches used to help people and neighbors used to help one another. know its some one from another state or the person down the block that might be having the same problem. There is so much abuse in buracracy that it just drains the the whole nation. People help all the time but this way is disconnecting us and making people bitter. When the Gov dosen’t let you keep more of your own money. How can you help that single mom you know or that strugling student. When the Gov gets the money that have to have someone distribute that money and that means hiring some one and some of the money is used for that and then it has to go to the state and some of that money is used to pay some one at the state level and bye the time it gets to ther person its very little amount because the building had to be payed for the paper clips and the electricity at all levels. Thats a lot of money wasted on the buracracy instead of the people. Its the same in business people often see just apart of what goes on they do not see the taxes they have to pay at state and fed level and unemployent when they are fired or layed off, The electricity bill and a hoste of things that are behind the senes. The bigger Gov gets the less money we have and the less we can help each other. Just remember Gov creats nothing therfore thay have no mony we pay them to protect us and our rights our borders and when they become a charity distrubter then they cannot do what they are sappose to do. The puplic is the ones who produce wealth and jobs and doctors and insurance co and walstreet and banks Gov dose not.
When Gov puts all these fees and and taxes. then business have to raise prices. Take for instance the tax on gas the gas co have to raise the price to pay for the fee the electric co has to raise prices to pay for the fee the resterant has to pay the fee several times they have to pay in electricity at the grocery store and the transportation to get the groceries to the store and of course the fee to the transporter because he had to pay the fee. So everyone gets less money in their pocket because they don’t pay the price in their own home but in every thing you buy or eat. So smaller gov means more money in our pockest to do with as we wish. Then the churches would hve more mony the single mom would have more money and so on and so on and children can afford to go to colege on and on .
Done.

Parent/Teacher Conferences were better attended because of President Obama!
I’m a secretary at Sam Adams Elementary School in Cassopolis, MI in SW lower MI.
I’m the receiptionest/secretary at the front desk. I’m 62 years old and very proud to be a Cassopolis graduate myself. I grew up in the wonderful area and so did 4 generations before me.
The pride for my school and community is never ending. We have lots of history here and we are home of the underground railroad also.
Our parent/teacher conferences were Feb. 26th&amp;27th and were better attended than usual.
I actually noticed the difference in scheduling appointments the day after President Obama’s speech.
Parents also told me at my desk that they were inspired by the President to be more active in their child’s educational process.
I want to thank President Obama for his influence on our parents, our community and my life. I’m so proud of him and I know he will make a difference in all areas.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Kathy Ruple

Dear President Obama,
I live in Victorville, the California High Desert and we have a Hugh problem within our surrounding cities, our community is underdeveloped. While in the media Autism is a topic of interest due to the alarming number of diagnosed children. Meanwhile, the High Desert is approximately 10yrs behind in program development, medical care and education for our children with autism. Primarily because we have no medical specialist for children, the nearest children’s hospital or trauma unit is 60 miles away. I have desperately looked around for help for my 12yr. old daughter with Autism and Tourettes. When you live in an underdeveloped area that lacks help, programs for autism, especially for an older autistic child, what do you do? My daughter Crystal, was not diagnosed until age 8, at the LA diagnostic Center. I had to go out of my area to receive a proper diagnosis for her, the Diagnostic center said, “Crystal was one of the many children from the High desert that fell through the cracks.” Crystal received no early interventions, no ABA therapy, or other types of services that may have benefited her. I have done many hours of research to search for help. Most autism groups would tell me if what you’re looking for is not listed on our website than programs around your area just haven’t been developed. So, how do I develop programs? How do I bring qualified educators, the medical professionals to the High Desert?
I’m afraid for the future of my child, as well as for other families with children with disabilities in my community. If help does not arrive, children will suffer. Without qualified professionals children are late diagnosed and do not receive early intervention. When children are late diagnosed the world around them may crumbles, regress and develop severe overlapping medical problems, I know, that is what happened to my child.
Government, City Officials and School Districts need to be less concerned about the cost of autism development and everyone needs to realize what will happen in the future if children are not helped today. State and Federal Government will have to financially care and pay for the cost of autistic children who will one day become adults and will not be able to function independently. I am concerned for tomorrow by what we don’t take care of today.
Can you help?
Thank you,
April M

Dear Mr. President,
My problems may seem small to many but they are huge to myself and my family.
My husband is 72 and still working a full time job because our children can’t seem to find better paying jobs, so we have to help them. I cannot work because of health problems. We owe somewhere in the neighborhood of $20,000 in Income Taxes, obviously we have no deductions. We will probably have to sell our home that we have lived in since the 70′s in order to pay the taxes. We are at a loss as to what to do. Should we sell the house and my husband keep working, or should we let our children do without proper food, housing,and clothing? If my husband keeps working then the taxes just keep going up. It’s a catch 22.

Dear President Obama:
Congratulations on your historic and unprecedented presidential victory. I would like to wish you the best in these very difficult times.
I also would like to request that in recognition of the countless immigrant contributions to this country, please use your executive powers to order a cease to the ICE raids that are separating families and causing further instability in our economy.
As you’ve said, we will be judged on what we build, not what we destroy. I agree that certainly we are judge on what we build and accomplishments but also if in the process we neglect to pay attention to the little things that matter greatly such “Family” and in the way we do not do anything to salvage it and destroy it or damage it in anyway; “We will be judged as well”.
I believe in building strong high quality communities, families and societies that will contribute majorly in our economic growth, health and social realignment. But if the government continues allowing ICE raids that separate humble and hardworking families I am afraid the results will be chaotic and the impact in our children will be regrettable and unimaginable; something we should not bank on.
I am appealing to you as a fellow American that voted for you and believes in “the Eminent Change” our country is undergoing. As a son of an emigrant myself I feel the urge to voice my concern regarding the ICE deportations that separate families and their children. I understand that such task might not be a simple one but impossible either. Our country is suffering enough already and our children should not pay the price for something I am certain we can fix responsibly.
Mr. President, I feel that a person that entered the USA illegally has broken the law and therefore there are consequences. But if this person came to United States looking for a better life for himself or family, like our immigrant fathers and work hard and contribute to our nation by paying taxes, educating himself to become a better person and citizen of our nation; I feel those individuals deserve a chance to become Legal Aliens and later around proud citizens of our country.
But if these people have bad criminal records, don’t contribute to our nation in any positive way, shape or form possible and neither by paying the require taxes, those individuals should be deported to their country of origin immediately. What America needs is the hard working honest immigrants to help us rebuild the nation, our cities, our townships, our society, families, homes and economy. Our nation is a country built by proud remarkable immigrants and those are our roots; why now when their children, “OUR CHILDREN” need our help we hesitate!!…and ought to empower ICE to exercise a law that it is not serving a valuable purpose rather than causing pain and sorrow in the hearts of our own children- our citizens and their families.
I read the letter you wrote to your girls telling them what you wanted for them in their future; I realized that it is the same thing all parents would like happening to their own children all over the United States with the difference that for those families ICE is separating and deporting as you read this letter will not meet the same faith.
It is within your power and will to put an end to the ICE separation of families and stop the deportations. I believe in change, and I believe in you, for that same reason I voted for you Mr. President.
I thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and for taking the time to read this letter. It’s encouraging to have, as President of the United States, a man who appreciates and embraces the role of family with open hands and economical innovation and restructure as part of America’s larger role as a world leader, and who wants to stimulate and encourage America’s growth in these areas.

Dear President Obama,
I live in Waimanalo in your home state of Hawaii. I have been employed for the Sate of Hawaii, Judiciary for over 21 years. Due to the budget crunch and the current economy our Governor is proposing that (1) All state employees take 36 furlough days this coming fiscal year 2009-2010. Our medical has gone up which reduces my income by $6,723.84(self plan). In all in fiscal year of 2009-2010 alone, I will be taking a pay cut of 22%.That does not factor in what she will do in fiscal year 2010-2011. I realize that everyone needs to sacrifice due to the situation but 22%. Working for the government for 22yrs. and to get slapped in the face like that is just not right. People seem to forget that Government employees pay their fair share of taxes too. Just think of the hardship on those with families. The biggest cuts in her great plan will come from the Department of Education(Our Keiki). Sad days for Hawaii. I think it is great of all the ways you are trying to help our nation through this crisis not only economically but through out the world. Can you give Governor Lingle a call and set her straight! Alohaaa from Hawaii, mahalo for your time.

Lets come right out with what I am going to say. I am a 15 year old male in Michigan. I am extremely Conservative and I don’t like you, at all…
Setting that aside I also respect you for a president, and you are sometimes ironic…Because I don’t like you I am often called a racist or a Nazi. I find this very offensive and I wish someone would step up and say something for me.
I have very good grades and I have nothing on my criminal recorded. Up till about 3 months ago I wanted drug users to shrivel up and die, but then I heard something, I cant remember what, and I started to change. I never would smoke pot, or for that matter anything illegal. I admit if marijuana was legilized I might try it in Tea form (I am a big tea nut) but I would never ever smoke it.
My father was kicked out of school 1 week before graduation for skipping school to smoke cigarettes with his friends. About 20 or so years later here he is. He was going to attend a music school, and become a teacher, but he hung out with the wrong people.
I have similar dreams of becoming a musician. In fact soon I will be attending Interlochen’s All State program. My life is to important to wast on drugs. I stand now more democratic than Conservative on the issue of drug laws.
We are locking up heroin users with crazy rapists and murderers. I would like you to look me in the face and say that is not wrong.
The reason I think marijuana is illegal is because we can’t tax it. If that is truly the reason then there is a problem. If we can tax CO2 emissions then we can tax anything. I am bringing this up because I am disgusted by this notion. There is no such thing as global warming, and there is a lot of hard evidence to support this. I would like you to watch a movie called The Global Warming Swindle.
I also call for more funding towards NASA. NASA planes to have a human back on the moon by 2020, that’s just about 10 years, I believe we can cut that number in half with more funding to NASA. If you think about it, space is our future. I sometimes just lie down and think about the future. I imagine us using warp drive to bringing us to the nearest stars, and government is replaced by a star fleet.
I know that you rely are not reading this letter, but to the person who does, I want you to open your eyes to other possibilities. I also want you to think about marijuana law reform, but not complete legilization, I don’t want a high surgen operating on me.
I know all of America wants you to change us, and so far you haven’t. I truly hope that with the next three years you will change this country.

Dear Mr. President,
I have a solution to help fix our economy. A Stimulus Bailout for the working class American people. Just imagine, ten thousand dollars to every American with a social security number. How would you control it? Easy, just give it to everyone in the form of a gift card with expiration dated between the next month to a year. That way everyone has no choice but to spend it or lose it. By doing that, people will be going out to spend it causing re-stock of products and making those suppliers have to produce more product, therefore creating more jobs for everyone. Even with American auto manufactures, if you use that money to buy a car, the company will put down half of what you put down to buy the car. That would re-open the shops for car dealerships and makers. It’s just I believe that the economy is in the people and that’s where you should start in order to rebuild this country. People get jobs because of requirement for products in certain fields, and as long as they get paid, they’ll spend that money, creating more requirements of products in other fields helping someone else out to receive a job because of the need of products and laborers. If people don’t spend money, then a lot of these companies will have to shut down because of the lack of orders. I believe to help the economy, you’ll have to start at the beginning, and that is by helping the people who helped create this world that we live in.
Thanks
The People’s People

Dear Mr. President,
I am so heart broken. A million of our Iraqi children are dead due to the war. 4,000 of our US children, our US soldiers, have been killed. Over 300,000 have brain injuries and over 300,000 of our children have PTSD or severe depression. These children, our troops, have experienced first hand such unspeakable acts that there is no way to express in human terms what they have experienced. 18 of our US troops, our children whom we love and cherish, not any less then when they were babes in our arms, commit suicide per day. More of our US troops, our children, have died due to suicide than have died in the war itself. My heart is broken. I cry every night for our children. We stand helpless in a pool of blood. I am but a simple teacher. There is no summer school this summer for our most at risk children and teachers are being laid off due to budget cuts. There has been a trillion dollars spent on the war. I predict that we will need billions more to build prisons for our children who are not receiving the most basic of needs. For those veterans whose claims are denied by the VA, they may wait as long as 4 years for their claim to be re-processed, if they can survive that long. If we are going to agree to such atrocities as war, we also need to agree to fully support and to care for our troops, our children, and their families. This, too, will take millions to trillions of dollars. We cannot turn our backs on our children when we have sent them like lambs to the slaughter. I beg of you to bring our children home. To save our children. Their fate, and the fate of the worlds children are now in your hands, Mr. President. I pray that God will find it in your heart, and in your soul, to care for and to protect our children as you would your very own.
God Speed ~

The letter that John Bisner wrote could not have been more true than anything I have ever read. Since I know and have suffered this first hand I truly understand how this affects me as a parent and seen what it does to a child of a illegal immigrant. It is a same that he only wants those things: a better life for himself and his family. He has taught himself English and prides himself in being a family man that is hardworking. After five years of a wonderful life it came to an end for me and our son on his way back from work we got that call, border patrol had picked him up. Now I have lost my love and my son his father. It is something no one can ever understand unless you have traveled. The laws need to change.

I understand that regulation CMS-1420 that originated in the Bush administration will cut benefits for Hospice Care effective this October 1, 2009. Mr President you already took action to protect these benefits for mostly seniors which also sets the stage for younger folks that also face terminal illness by enacting a one year moratorium through the recently passed stimulus package. I would implore you to permanently rescind this regulation.
My son of 14 years and my second son 28 years old died from Cancer. At that time ,1987 for my 14 year old and 2005 for my 28 year old, Hospice would have helped us through this terrible time. Why would we want our seniors or any other Americans to languish in a hospital bed at great expense rather than give them and their families the option of being home with their families at end of life. Hospice is far more compassionate and cost affective. I would hope you would take the appropriate action to end this regulation.

Dear President Obama,
I am writing to you with the hope that you will be able to help out my community.
We are scared and having a gang war in our town. Maywood, Il. is where I have been residing since I was 5. I am now 35 and married with 2 children an 18 year old and a 10 year old. We need help. As of today 07/23/2009 the wars on the street in our town are out of control. We are worst that the westside of Chicago and our children are killing one another ever hour. President this is a plea of help. I am so sad since I have so much family in Maywood and the little children are constantly dodging bullets going to school. The officals in our town have taken away our center for the children and we have nothing I mean nothing for them to do. President even if you can’t do something is it at all possible that you could send some officals to help the police take back over the streets. This is so scary that we are worst that Englewood IL. Please Please help!!!!!!!!

Dear Mr. President, My name is Kenya Bernard, I live in Chicago ,IL. I wanted to say that i am proud of the work that you do.

I am scared of losing my job because i am so used to working. I have been working since i was 13. I have quite a bit of experience. But i learned that with you in office you are that will that will somehow in time make a way. I have confidence in you. I know that i will be ok as long as you are here. I also know that me and my children will not be on the streets again. I want to say keep up the good work and may GOD bless you and your entire family. I love you OBAMA FAMILY.

Dear President Obama: First, thank you for bringing new hope to the American people. I wish to make this brief comment regarding the mortgae crisis. My wife and I fall into the category of many Americans. We have good credit, we are employed and have not missed or been late on any payments. We have made the same foolish mistake as many others, during a brief time, a time my wife was off work and bed ridden due to surgery we made the decision to get an adjustable mortage thinking we would be able to refinance in a few short years. Now our home has lost value and we are sitting ducks waiting to be slaughtered when the loan resets in March.
My comment is not about this common struggle but about our lender American Home Mortgage Services Inc. AHMSI. I write because I believe they use Your honerable name dishonestly. Let me explain as briefly as I can:
The HOPE counciler instructs us go contact AHMSI as a first step–This is the difficulty. If you go to the website to fill out forms you will be cut off just before you finish the process. We tried three times. If you try to follow up on the phone you will get the option of entering 10 digit information to connect. You are CUT OFF upon entering the ninth digit for all three options. We tried many times overs several weeks. All of this discouraging pretense to help is preceded by the message of helping in your good name Mr. President Obama. Thought you might want to know your name is being used to PRETEND to help when I truly believe you Mr. Obama do not wish for AHMIS to pretend in your honerable name. It is sad for us. We have made our payments and only increased our income. We wish to keep our home. We are in our 50s. It is difficult to start over.

Dear President Obama,
This is just a short note to say I wouldn’t want your job for any amount of money. The next thing I want to say is I NEED some job. I hope and pray I can find a job soon. I would be willing to train for any position. My two degrees haven’t help me find a job. Being aged 60 doesn’t help. However, I absolutely must find work because I’ve been unemployed for 17 months. I worked hard to help you get your job. I hope someone will help me find work. Thank you.
God bless.

Dear President Obama,
I have a request for you to look into something I find troubling. The credit reporting agencies. I don’t agree that an employer should use these as a decision to hire someone. I do believe in the drug testing and criminal background checks. These credit reporting agencies are under not supervision of how they operate by any government mandate. They allow things on but never address how long they stay on or take off. Yes I had financial difficulty in the past but I have always worked. I made more money per hour in 1980 and 1990 then I do now. (it doesn’t relate but it seems the hourly workers wages are falling each year)As it becomes harder and harder to find work a person’s credit report should not be allowed to be used by employers. Employees should have and need some employee rights. Would you see if any type of legistration could cover this issued. As I said I think a lot of Americans fall into this employment hole. Thank you and as you are our president I’m proud to be an American

Congrads President Obama. I am a fifty eight year old single woman that has worked every since I can remeber and that is what brings me to this matter of concern.This may help get us out of the ressecion that we are in and for sure give the economy the boost that it really needs.We are still bailing out the rich, when the poor is the ones spending the money.Here is the stimulus plan that just might work for the american people and I think we the american people should be able to vote on this.I would call it the Stimulus packet with options. Give every working american over fifty years of age one million dollars tax free.But the stipulations would be that they would have to retire (their choice) in order to receive the monies.That would open up the job market and the unemployment rate would drop considerable.Next they would have to buy a brand new automobile and that would open up the auto industry.And last but not least if they have a home they would have to pay off the mortgage.If they don’t have a home they would have to buy one, this would open up the housing market. And I would just like to say I am all for the health care refore. Great job to you and your staff, I’m sure that you could not do it with out them or the American people. Thanks for listing.P.S. I also think the crime rate would go down considerable.

Dear Presdient Obama, Like many Americans I am seeking a purpose inlife. I am 60 female and wondering if you will create a“cash for clunkers for used granma and mothers”. I have been a successful real estate power broker, designer of“at Risk youths”grant program, facilitator of a college community partnership program and am now living out of my car, or in a house partially owned by my son. I have ost bother houses this year and am faced with a 1099c totally $900,000 in unearned income taxes. I have not earned more than $3000. this year and total of $4,500 last year. I just qualified for emergency food stamps in Riverside county CA. I have applied to the FDIC, and state for jobs. I have also applied for unemplyment , disabilty and mental benefits. Last week I was turned away from receiving mental (emotional therrapy) from the iNio mental clinic,becasue the state is not taking on New patients. Si I guess I better not have a nervous breakdown. I have taken my plight to a heavenly prayer and sent a email off to Ophra. ( I think she might be more powerful than you are.) I am not asking for a handout. I just want to be part of a solution to help. If you can give an Ethopian part of our $650 billion budget,then can I be on her team to help the non-profits. I volunteer at domestic violence centers teaching art as therapy for children, at camp erin in Big Bear through the Moyer foundation and Mourning Star. I am not complaining, I just want to help others so I have a purpose and feel like I matter again. I have a BA in Business Admin and am a novice in Spanish and French. I do have good people skills, I ama good team player or I can be a leader. Although I am white, I did grow up on the wrong side of the tracks…I just do not want to go back there.

Hello,Mr.President. I need to let you know that as being a ex-felon,No one wants to give us a chance in life. I was sentenced to prison for drugs&amp;trafficting in stolen property in 1998. I did 6.5 years. In june 2007 I was acussed of a crime,then my attorney got my case thrown out because the lady lied. She acussed her Lawyer,Bishop,Her best friends and Doctor for stealing from her.Because I was an ex-felon,they wanted to stick it to me. The lady who acussed me,Her best friends paid for attorney for me,for they knew she was lying. Now that is on my record as well. Why can’t we have a life? I’am not a drug addict or a thief anymore, I did my time,Please let me find a real job.So I can support my family.For we are about to be homeless, My Fiance is not well,she is on oxygen. So thank you Mr. President for at least looking into this for me.

Dear Mr. President,
I am pleased that you are working to clean up the mortgage lending mess that was created by lenders who relaxed their lending criteria. People got into homes that they just could not afford. There is, however, another incidious problem of credit. I’m talking about the reporting of credit.
I appreciate the attempt by Darlene Hooley with FACTA. But it did not go far enough and frankly does not have much enforcement. The three major reporting agencies still have trouble reporting correctly. The socalled clearing house EOSCAR does not address the inhouse coding system that is still retained by the three credit reporting agencies. Thus when you order individual reports from all three agencies, the information can be wildley differnt. The credit information comes from the creditor to the agencies in a single format. How do the agencies continue to get it wrong? Example: How does the tradeline for J C Penny go from current with Equifax, to 60 days delinquent with Experian, to a collections account with Transunion? This has got to stop. This kind of reporting is ruining people’s lives. The credit reporting agencies must be held more accountable for confusing Sr. with Jr., missed key strokes, and transposition errors. I would cringe when I heard mothers excited about naming their sons Jr. because inevitalby the sins of the father could be visited upon the son, or the sins of the son could be visited upong the father.

Dear Mr. President,
I have a proposal that has the potential to save millions of gallons of oil per year. The program would create jobs for the country and move the United States to the forefront of responsibility. You spoke of our citizens needing to make smart wise decisions. This is our chance. Not only will it save money for the American public, but reduce demand of foreign oil. This program is not unlike others that have led to innovations that have improved our environment. I have a plan. If you’re interested, please let me know.
Best Regards,
Sidney Hand

Yours and my hopes for fairness for all people are being sacrificed for a notion of conciliation with the republicans.

I share your believes and I’m proud of having a President with such a great vision for this country. As you may see, I’m an inmigrant ( legal), I became a citizen in 2006 and proud of it.

I believe in the words of President Kennedy’ “ Is not what your country can do for you, is what you can do for your country”
Right now, the country is asking to put all of our different apart and help restore this great nation. Not matter the color of your skin, your ethnic background, your religious believe or your political views. This is not the time to see what can we get from America, it is the time to see what can we do for America. It is time to look for America’s interest and not our personal interest. Lets all work together to bring America to be one of the greatest country in the world.
I do love this country and want to se America working again. I want to see our politicians working for the American people and their needs. Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, etc.
It is time to do what you guys are supposed to do……YES WE CAN

Dear President Obama,
I’m writing you in regards to my son Michael Curtis Warren, in hopes of you looking over his case. I’ve raised him since he was six years old. When he was 18 years of age on September 23rd, 1996 he was involved in a car accident. His lawyer at the time (a public defender) told us everything will be fine. Well he was sentenced four years to the California department of corrections. He started out on felony Probation for 3 years. He did most of the 3 years but ended up violating his felony probation. When he was released he ran to sc because he no more family left their in California. He did fine for awhile in South Carolina. In 2004 he went back to California to visit his ex wife and kids. He was arrested and sent to jail in Monterey county jail. He was given his 4 years of prison sentence. This was suspended. After a 14 month sentence he was released. He stayed in Avenal Ca. for about 6 months till he left because of a violation. Just to state, he never committed another crime. All his violations where minor simple violations. He had transferred his parole after his next violation to South Carolina. He had violated his parole in sc for failure to pay and failure to follow instructions. He went back and was released this year. He had left California because he has no support in California. All he’s trying to do is work and support his family. He had just had a new baby girl whose name is Joslynn. Right now his parole wants him to return and clams they can’t do nothing for him in regards to his living, so that he could finish his last 5 months of his parole. We are concerned that he might end up having to sleep on the streets. We ourselves don’t have the means to take care of his living situation so he can find a job which I know is difficult at the time with the way things are with our recession. All we are asking is that you look at his case and see if you can help. He is willing to finish his last 4 month of parole. With him in South Carolina, he can work and care for his family. He’s not a carrier criminal. He has made his mistakes in his life. He is a caring father to 4 kids.I does appreciate your time and help. Thank you…

Well he was sentenced four years to the California department of corrections. He started out on felony Probation for 3 years. He did most of the 3 years but ended up violating his felony probation. When he was released he ran to SC. because he had no family left their in California, because I went to work with Lear Sigler Corp. down in Charleston South Carolina at the Navel weapon station for the preposition ships for the Army. And so my wife and I moved to Columbia SC. My son did fine for awhile in South Carolina. In 2004 he went back to California to visit his ex wife and kids. He was arrested and sent to jail in Monterey county jail. He was given his 4 years of prison sentence. This was suspended. After a 14 month sentence he was released. He stayed in Avenal Ca. for about 6 months till he left because of a violation. Just to state, he never committed another crime. All his violations where minor simple violations.

He had just had a new baby girl whose name is Joslynn, and a step daughter Jennha. Right now his parole wants him to return to CA. and he has no place to stay or live when he gets there, they can’t do nothing for him in regards to his living, so that he could finish his last 5 months of his parole. And his parole sad that, that is not their problem. We are concerned that he might end up having to sleep on the streets. We ourselves don’t have the means to take care of his living situation. And finding a job is very hard for a convent In CA, so all we are asking is that you look at his case and see if you can help. He is willing to finish his last 4 month of parole. With him in South Carolina, he can work and care for his family. He’s not a carrier criminal. He has made his mistakes in his life. He is a caring father to 4 kids. And all he had was a car accident, I do appreciate your time and help. Thank you and God Bless for all the work you have done. And our prayers go out to you and your staff.

Dear Barack Obama, dear Mr. President:
The history of social security is one of compromise.Landmark legislation that it was, it passed as compromise legislation. More radical proposals were proposed. Many citizens today are happy it did.
To go down in history for such remarkable landmark equal coverage for all, it has to be Single Payer. Too few even know what it is. But you Mr. President could eloquently, very briefly and simply say something about the clear,simple, all encompassing 75 page bill. We’ll do the rest.
Never before, in my lifetime, have I seen so much hope. I come from the age group that votes, seniors. Give us this clarity. Give us this leadership. Give the people this information and this bill then has a chance at law.
With the people behind you on this, you will get even more folks voting again, and be more than assured of a second term. Glory!
And you don’t have to move from your own position. Please just add information to the health care debate. Very few people are learning exactly what single payer is. Confusion and hatred abound.
Get more of the public involved. What percentage of people actually vote? Give us the clarity that single payer will be self funded like social security, and cover everyone from birth for everything medically necessary.
This is the single most significant human right of our time, needing your clarity.

Health Care Reform is a necesity today, keep up the good fight.
Thank you for given the working American, the middle and poor class American hopes that there is a light at the end of the tunel. Health care is a right not a privilige. Why let the health insurances profit and gamble with Americans health and money? It is time to stop the insanity!

Dear President Honorable Barack Obama:
I am here to reside the fact of you decision on taking down the missle protection system and why it needs to stay.
North Korea and Most Countries that are against us have weapons aimed ready to launch at our priceless Country and end up losing many if that protection is taken down, I have researched my thoughts and have come to a conclusion that the thoughts of destroying the missle system will not save you money, it will end up losing lives cause we will become vulnerable to attacks, and it will be 9/11 x 11,000,000 cause it will be catistrophic in so many ways.
I am a Single man in the military joined January 27, 2009 in the efforts to serve my country as my Father has once done as a Naval Sailor he was in for a good time of 17 years and had to quit to take care of My Little Brother and I from harm as my Mother was thrown in Prison and I am going to serve my time as well.
Well take these thoughts from not just me but the People of the Military and People from the Country.
As i took this time from you, i respect the decisions you will put forth but just keep in mind the thoughts of what the people have to say.
Thank you for your time

Dear Mr. President;
There is help out there for people, in foreclosure. At least in the area of Oregon where I live and it’s growing. Thanks to a dream my boss had one night.I am blessed to work for a wonderful man who truley cares about others. As he watched family after family, neighbor after neighbor, stranger after stranger loosing everything they owned. He began doing everything he could to help. He contacted local banks, local tv stations, family counselors, and many others seeking ones that would donate their time to help those in crises right now. He saw how many of these organizations that were constantly advertizing to help these people, yet always for a price. A very high price at a time these individuals were desperate and needing to trust or take a chance any chance they would, only to be taken and receive nothing.
My boss, Pete Cislo, has now started an organization called“HOPE”. Which has went from the Medford, OR. to other surrounding areas. This organization which he puts many of his own hours into to just to help someone, is really helping many individuals. They provide counseling for individuals in or with the possibility of foreclosue free of charge. They provide free counseling with real estate matters and personal matters. Providing them with the knowledge not to get taken, to assist them in a time when they need the assistance and to stay together hopefully as a family when that becomes very difficult.
I just wish you could take a look at this program. Maybe through the heart of one man we can help many others.
Thank you Kathy

Dear Mr. President: I am a physician working as a P.C.P. in almost a rural area in Texas. To follow part of your recommendations I opened my practice with electronic equipment in June/09. For that reason I bought an EMR, called PRAXIS in advanced, April/09. Now we are in October/09 and still I can not use my electronic medical records. It is a common complaint in the medical community. Too many vendors with no quality control. Is it something you have in plan to be fixed?
Many Thanks, from a frustated Dr.

Dear President Obama,
It is imperative that you take IMMEDIATE ACTION to help ensure that services provided by Doctors of Chiropractic are fully protected in any final legislation likely to emerge from Congress.
Specifically, we must:
Guarantee that essential services delivered by a Doctor of Chiropractic are included as a covered benefit under any national reform plan.
I became very frustrated when I discovered Chiropractic was very helpful in making me stronger against winter illness and also helping me with IBS symptoms yet my insurance company would not help pay for my care!
What I don’t understand is why it is better to allow these conditions to continue and perhaps get worse! When being regularly adjusted I enjoyed good health and therefore my expenses were low on the health care front!
Ensure that all plans (including Medicare) allow for full direct access to the providers and health care pathways of their choice. Every patient should have the right to choose and be reimbursed for all health care services from doctors of chiropractic without barriers and limitations that unfairly restrict their freedom of choice.
This is important as that MD’s don’t help keep us well! I remember complaining of cough that wouldn’t go away, especially during flu season in winter. When my MD gave me a pill that was normally for epilepsy I said to myself this isn’t for me. I believe it made me ill and I had to vomit! I choose natural, safe, gentle adjustments that keep me stronger!
Defeat any attempt to impose an MD-referral requirement for patients to obtain access to chiropractic care.
If I don’t go to an MD, how am I supposed to get a referral?????

To Mr. President, I have been unemployed for 9 months with a masters degree in health care and can not find a job. I am a single mother of twins and coming close to losing everything I have because I can not get a offer after numereous interviews and can not figure out why. But the real reason for my letter is my anger with all the scam letters I receive each week from Nigeria. At least 10 letters a week and several from actual government officials that I have googled their name and sure enough they were. They are sending me a letter to commit a crime and steal money from their country. For ex: extra money for bids to complete work they want to take the money themselves. Or a blind woman claiming her husband died and he has money but it is in secret and she needs help getting it out of the country and invested in out stock market. Again I looked her up and she indeed is a government official and her husband is her guide and driver. I am outraged with all these letters that I feel we need to totally stop all business to and from this country, as well as stop all food, medicine and money being sent to this country from he United States. Of course it is not just officials, I just got another one this week from a Professor and former govt official. Then you have your regular lottery winning emails. I am so tired of receiving them that if I change my email, they win and they will find me again. Please investigate these government officials. Investigate how many Americans are being scammed out of money from people in Nigeria. Zero tolerance should be our moto with this country and stop all aide and business relations to this country. They need to be punished. It is worse that Americans are being taking for money when America is helping them. I am ashamed to admit I have been a victim by simply trying to sell a wedding ring on craigslist and recieved a fake letter from alertpay. Please stop all business and aid to this country. They don’t deserve our help when their own government officials are fore front in commiting these crimes. Brenda Pagano

The Frustrated Unemployed
I am the self appointed poster women for the unemployed. Seriously, although it is a joke, I seem to be the one person who gets their picture taken at all of the organizations “JOB FAIRS”. I made the front page when I applied for employment at the last country club offering; Then two weeks later, while standing inline at the EDD (Employment Development Department for the State of California in Indio).
At this job fair, we were asked to show our “white cards” as we entered. To many this caused confusion and added to their already insecure feelings of competition. I made a joke to ease their frustration telling a few, who were within my voice range, that I Have a White Card! Woooouwho! I explained that I have had my membership “Premier Pass Card” for over a year. It will not buy you a cup of coffee on any cold or hot winter night. In fact, you still had to sign in on the paper roster. So what’s my point? I am a frustrated public figure for the unemployed.
Here is a suggestion that would really help the unemployed. Instead of every employer reading through thousands of employment applications, and making thousands of people sign in on rosters (that will only be thrown away), why doesn’t the EDD allow for the Premier pass membership people to post their once filled out employment history/resume/reference for employers to access?
When I left I offered this suggestion to one of the lucky employees of the state. He mentioned that the reason was that every employer had their own application and disclaimer. Dah! That’s my point! I for one would much rather sign a universal disclaimer, than to fill out dozens of applications, stating the same stuff over and over and over again. If we take the time to use the EDD and obtain their white Cards, then it should really help the people who go through the process.
I think that these “EDD Job Fairs” are only an attempt to fill in a check box that may meet a state mandate. For the most part, at this job fair the representatives of the potential employer just made us sign in again on their roster and gave us more paperwork telling us to go online to their website for testing dates etc………
IT has to be easy to understand that saving a tree should also include developing a web base or universal job application and disclaimer especially during this recession period. Although we do not have many employers left in the state of California, why doesn’t the state make it easier for the citizen (or not) to simply have the employer used the white card EDD Premier Pass CODE to gain access to the perspective employee’s work history/references and resume. I would much rather sign in giving them my EDD Premier Pass Code ( ?) than to fill in 100’s of applications and sign 100’s of rosters.
Makes sense to me!

Foreclosure Farce
Now here is one better. I received a notice (last week) from Green point (who used to have my first) that the Colorado house will go to sale on March 23. I also received a notice a month before this that Countrywide took over the loan. I called Countrywide, since Greenpoint has a recording that states they are no longer is business, and talked with them. I offered to do a deed in lieu in order to protect the house from weather and being vacant( pipes bursting etc). Countrywide states that it is their POLICY that they will not take the house back unless I have it listed for 90 days on the market at fair market value. I explained that I did have it listed up until 4 days ago, but my agent quit. My agent quit because I would not sign an offer unless Greenpoint and Countrywide would sign off on a deficiency judgment. And since Greenpoint isn’t in business they will not sign anything (yet they can still foreclose?) countrywide states that they are not foreclosing and I have to relist find another agent since they now have the house and not Greenpoint. I explained that no agent will list the property since it is scheduled to go to sale on the 23rd of March. So here it is, no one wants the house. I can’t even do a deed in lieu. I think the lenders are scamming the government. They are getting bail out money, setting up their tax loss books and the homeowners will have tax penalties if the short sale. Bottom line is that now Countrywide is out of business and doing the same thing that Greenpoint is doing; Loss carry forward, just on my house alone. Can you imagine how many other homeowners are getting hurt by these lenders? The lenders are getting their bail out money, controlling the market price of their loss inventory and still not putting any money out to care for the property. I think they are all scamming the public!
Why else would Countrywide try and force me to list the property on the market for 90 days before they would take a deed in lieu?
Update: This year, 2009 I have lost both houses, totally $900,000 (in Colorado and California). I am now on food stamps. (Now mind you, I have a Bachelors in Business Administration and Management and have worked over 49 years. I am 60 years old and was a self made millionaire). I am lucky and loving the fact that I can sleep in a clean bed. Although I no longer have my own home or furniture…I consider myself very lucky to be able to have a house to sleep in, when available. I am unable to pay rent or utilities, but I do have food. I am not sure if I will ever get lucky enough to get a job. I do not get unemployment, because I have waited so long to apply. I have no more savings and do not have medical insurance. I can not even get mental health therapy, since it is no longer free. Besides, I am not mental crazy, just over stressed at times. I would love to just be helpful and useful.
Bottom line….Oh yeah that’s me!

Dear Mr. President Obama,
My family and I are at a crossroads, due to predatory lending practices, Wells Fargo, Sterling, Colorado. We obtained a“toxic”commercial/business loan from Wells Fargo that we have been banking for over 15 years. We believed in fairness, especially from the bank that we trusted with our money for such a long period of time. We have an excellent credit history ( FICO scores 814 and 798 ) and will be losing it all to Wells Fargo’s inability to provide us with a fair loan ( we defaulted in the first 6 months- a loan that should not have been approved) .
Mr. President, we have always paid our obligations on time and in full, Wells Fargo Denver Colorado ( the loan has been transferred there for being 3 months late on payments)is pushing us with fierceness into foreclosure, would not return our phone calls other than to threaten us with foreclosure. Please help us avoid despair, loss of dignity and all of our assets to this cruel giant, Wells Fargo Bank. We will do anything to avoid foreclosure and have taken steps towards selling/leasing the property, maxed our credit cards, maxed our personal line of credit, sold most of our assets. Wells Fargo is acting in a vindictive manner at this point, because we have voiced our concerns. This letter to you, Mr. President, may even cost us dearly in our relationship/or lack of with Wells Fargo . We will continue voicing our concerns and maybe help others avoid“toxic”loans and predatory lending practices from Wells Fargo. Thank you, Tim B

He lost his house in Colorado which could have been saved with the money. He lives at home on SS with his parents who now try to keep bills paid and supporting him too. What should take the Va so long to get out money to the Vet.He is put on depression pills even tried killing himself who wouldn’t be depressed. After the war are they forgotten.

Dear President Obama
Here is away to fund the Medical program
Legalize Marijuana and then tax it. Sell it in Drug stores like a prescription drug but do not need a prescription.
The money collected from the taxes will be used for your medical program
This will also help the economy because as people go into the drug store to buy the Marijuana they will all so buy other products while they are there.
This will also help the overburden prison system with crowding issues less people in jail for carrying Marijuana
And more room for the real criminals.

DEAR Mr President Obama, I believe that
we should interview and evaluate each person who is on SSI.!!..because i believe that some Citizens who are collecting SSI.!!..Are able to work..!!
and there are some Citizens who really
do qualify..we would save Millions.!!!
I have talked to several people who are
collecting SSI and i think that they have a drug problem..!!Not a Disability.

Dear President,
I am hoping you read my e-letter. I have been sick since birth. But I’m not writing on my behalf. I am writing on behalf of America. Humbly I ask that when your in Illinois you can find time to meet with me. I have the solution to many areas that are destroying out planet. I also have solutions in place of the health care plan, and to also reverse the financial deficit problem; not to mention many other problems and factors. I am not looking for any publicity or attention drawn to me at all. The world has gone power hungry everywhere. Many say some crucial things on your behalf. You appear to be a very open minded person that would listen. I can’t type everything on here. This is souly a one to one converstation that could reverse several contraverities that are taking place. Illinois has gotten hit the worse with these new tax laws. Please, Listen, the people will listen to sound guidance. May the Lord Jesus Christ lead you to the path of ordered footsteps of the Lord, may His wisdom&amp;guidance walking in liberty and truth enlighten you for your eyes to be opened and your mind to be enlightened to the Truth. May God bless You richly according to His perfect will.

PLEASE, I need your help to stay in my home. Bank of America acquired my mortgage 3 months ago and want to raise my payments by 77.00 per month. My insurance AND taxes HAVE NOT INCREASED on my 30 year fixed. My previous mortgage company had no problem with my mortgage NOW BOA has a problem. I can not afford this increase, if they impose it I will loose my house. I have had trouble with BOA since the second month they had my mortgage. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, help me keep my house. Thanks in advance, Jennifer

idea or just go on vacation and enjoy yourself while in the White house and we will take care of everything but Dont make the same mistake as President Bush with Katrina. Just picture the some states are struggling more than others and those states are really ran by others that would not care about anyone but themselves and there family and closest friends and aquiantences which we would call the good old boys club and just to fair would really have younger people running the country or business is the cause of this economy because lack of experience and up bringing of lack of respect to elders is a growing trend in corporate america. what education could not train ignorace takes over and bad decisions are made. Career training can help but debt will take over when a person cant get hired because its not a degree. I have been unemployed and i dont recieve unemployment or disability,or food stamps I have lost all of my possessions car, home, everything, I have over 60,000 plus in debt, i had bill collectors call me and i answered the phone and tell them that i have applied for there company for a job and they have not even called me back for an interview, yes i said that right i applied for job at bank and a collection agency and no job response, and the bank i applied for had my car loan there you would think that to hire someone that has the loan with them so you really know that the money would be invested back into the bank and not spent somewhere else while investing in the person to keep the loan current,its just not logical these days everything is done so wrong when it comes to common sense.

I am questioning the authenticity of these letters. After the anthrax scare of 2001, all letters to Congress and the White House to my knowledge are irradiated prior to being sent to the recipient. This is to ensure that anthrax spores are killed and are rendered harmless. Radiation makes such envelopes and letters inside of them very brittle and fragile. In one photo, Obama is holding a crisp letter. This type of letter would not have gone through irradiation. I smell something rotten here, unless there are Whiet House guinea pigs prereading the letters in some remote location.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND BOTH THE CONGRESS AND HOUSE OF REPRESENITIVES.
WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR ALL OF YOU. MR. PRESIDENT WE THE PEOPLE ELECTED YOU ON YOUR STAND FOR CHANGE. YOU PROMISED US A COMPRHENSIVE INSURANCE REFORM PACKAGE THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL THE PEOPLE. INSTEAD WE ARE GETTING AN HEALTHCARE REFORM PACKAGE THAT DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE OR LOWER THE COST OF MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR US THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE WATCHED OVER THE PAST MONTHS AS THIS REFORM HAS BECOME A WIN WIN FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, PHARMASUTICAL COMPANIES AND THE DOCTORS WHILE DOING NOTHING TO CONTRAL THE HIGH COST OF MEDICAL CARE.
WE THE PEOPLE ALSO HAVE TO ASK THE MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES WHO DO YOU WORK FOR? THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS OR US THE PEOPLE? WE THE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A LOBBIEST FOR WHAT WE WANT, YOU ARE OUR LOBBIEST, BUT YET EACH ONE OF YOU HAVE DESTROYED THIS HEALTH CARE REFORM BY CAVING IN TO THE LOBBIEST. AGAIN WHO DO YOU WORK FOR SPECIAL INTREST OR THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE PASS A BILL THAT DOES NOTHING FOR WORKING AND POOR AMERICANS. YOU HAVE ALL CAVED IN TO THE LOBBIEST AND PREASURE GROUPS. HOW ABOUT DOING WHAT YOU WERE ELECTED TO DO? WE ELECTED ALL OF YOU TO REPRESENT ALL OF US AND YOU HAVE DONE A MISRABLE JOB OF DOING SO. YOU ALL HAVE SOLD US OUT TO EVERYONE. YOU HAVE ALLOWED THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE PHARMACUTICAL COMPANIES TO DICTATE THE BASE OF THIS REFORM THAT IS NOT A REFORM. NOT ONE OF YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR INSURANCE TO WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR ALL OF YOU TO REALIZE THAT WE THE PEOPLE ARE WHO YOU WORK FOR?
HOW CAN YOU ALL LOOK AT YOUR SELVES IN THE MIRROR EVERY DAY KNOWING THAT YOU ARE NOT WORKING FOR US BUT FOR THE LOBBIEST? EVERY ONE OF YOU IN WASHINGTON HAS A HEALTH CARE PACKAGE THAT COVERS EVERYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG IN YOUR LIVES. SO WHAT IS SO HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME HEALTH CARE. THIS REFORM HAS BECOME SUCH CRAP THE WE THE PEOPLE FEEL THAT WE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. WE HAVE LISTENED TO ALL OF YOU TELL US WHY THIS PACKAGE IS EITHER GOOD OR BAD YET NOT ONE PERSON IN WASHINGTON HAS REALLY LISTENED TO US THE PEOPLE. IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT YOU WHO WORK FOR US TAKE A STAND AGINST ALL THE LOBBIEST AND PRESSURE AND GET TOGETHER AND PASS A REFORM THAT YOU WOULD ENROLL IN. ASK YOUR SELF WOULD I GIVE UP MY PRESENT INSURANCE TO GO WITH THIS NEW PLAN? IF YOU ANSWER NO WHY SHOULD WE THE PEOPLE ACCEPT IT. WE ARE NOT SECOND CLASS CITIZENS WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED YOU IN OFFICE ON THE PREMIS THAT YOU WOULD REPRESENT US THE PEOPLE AND NOT LARGE BUSINESS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN REMEMBER YOUR RHETORIC WILL ONLY GO SO FAR. WE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SHEEP NOR ARE WE STUPID. YOU TREAT US LIKE CHILDREN AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WE WANT TO HEAR BUT YOU DON’T LISTEN TO US. ALL OF YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE ORIGIONAL CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH CARE REFORM AND EXPECT US TO LIKE IT. HERE IS WHAT WE THE PEOPLE WOULD RELLY LIKE TO HAVE.
1 AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.
2. AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTIONS,
3. LOWER COST OF MEDICAL HELP,
4. CONTROLS ON WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN DO
OR NOT DO.
5. BASICLY WE WANT THE HEALTH CARE YOU HAVE THAT WE THE PEOPLE PAY FOR.
6. CONTROLL FRAUD BY LISTING TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.
7. STOP THE OVERBILLING OF MEDICAL COST.
IN CLOSING THIS IS JUST THE BASICS THAT ALL OF YOU FORGOT. YOU ALL FORGOT WHO YOU WORK FOR SO LET ME REMIND YOU. YOU WORK FOR US THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND NO ONE ELSE. SO GET UP OFF YOUR BUTTS AND REFORM HEALTH CARE LIKE IT’S FOR YOU. IF YOU WON’T ACCEPT IT NIETHER SHOULD WE.
SHOW US YOU TRULY MENT WHAT YOU SAID WHEN WE ELECTED YOU. WORK FOR US NOT SPECIAL INTEREST WE ARE TIRED OF BEING PUSSED TO THE BACK OF THE BUS.

ANTHONY D

WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITES STATES

Dear Mr. President,
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. I think you are doing a wonderful job. I see on occasion that your polling numbers are down but no one ever asks me what I think. since I no longer have a land line and am not often home during the day I am not one of the few who can easily be asked. I hope you know that not many people are reached by poll takers. Those of us who approve of your outstaning performance must be unavailable.
I have been unemployed since May but I don’t blame you for the mess you predecessor caused in the previous eight years. there are so many hot items to handle as a result of his behavior and attitiude. Thank you for giving peace a chance and not being a world bully and bringing thought and consideration back to national policy.
I do have an opinion about everything but I withhold it for now.
Wishing you and the entire family and staff a happy holiday. And thank you for the health care plan.
Sincerely,
Mary

Mr. President,Have a merry Christmas and a happy new year with your family and close associates. I would like to remind you of the returning veterans who have experienced the sting of battle and the damage that has been done to their psyche. I am a retired firefighter with the city of Austin, Texas and am a volunteer driver for Disabled American Veterans, and am a veteran of the vietnam era. Many of the horrors that these men and women have experienced take on a surreal quality and sometimes it is dificult for them to adjust to the daily experience of living in a relatively peaceful society. Their brains have been scarred by what they have had to do and I hope that an evaluation of their mental as well as physical health is being addressed in a routine way. Every one of them should be aware of the warning signs of depression and anger resulting from their military service. I transport many veterans every week to local hospitals for care and virtually all of them are grateful for the care they receive from the Veterans Administration. Please ensure that these honorable men and women are cared for and take a proactive role in their return to narmalcy. God love you and keep you and your family. Sincerely, Richard Dale Bailey.

Dear Mr. President Obama
My name is Jonathan D an I was reading horrible incident that happened on the Northwest Airline an that to me was the most terrible thing for someone to do. But I was thinking that what if the airport an private airlines uses undercover terrorist security cause I was doing research on the attacks of our country an all the terrorists was looking for recruitment to fulfill there mission to harm our country an by hiring someone to walk around as a civilian an talk to someone that my raise a eyebrow will be something that throws them off. Because all the terrorist know the TSA members so they will stay away from them to avoid problems with there duties. But Sr I don’t want to take up to much of your time cause I know you are a busy man I was just thinking outside the box, so enjoy your holiday with the family an I think you are doing a great job as the President.

I AGREE WITH NUMEROUS COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOVE. I AM A VETERAN THAT SERVED 21 YEARS IN THE MILITARY. WHEN I WENT IN THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE FREE MEDICAL CARE WHEN I RETIRED SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS TO STAY IN AS WELL AS WANTING TO ASSURE THAT MY COUNTRY STAYS FREE. NOW HERE I AM HAVING TO PAY FOR MY MEDICAL AS WELL AS HAVING TO PAY FOR MY CARE FROM MY DISABILITY FROM WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY. I CALLED AND SAID THAT I WOULD BE GLAD TO COME BACK IN THE MILITARY AFTER 9/11. THEY WOULD NOT TAKE ME BECAUSE I WAS OVERWEIGHT. I REALLY THINK THAT THE VETERANS ASSOCIATIONS NEED TO GET MORE ATTENTION TO GIVE THE SOLDIERS THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AS WELL AS WHAT THEY HAVE DESERVED KEEPING THIS COUNTRY FREE. RIGHT NOW I AM HAVING TO FIGHT TO KEEP MY DISABILITY WHICH HAS GOTTEN WORSE SINCE I HAVE RETIRED. WHY DO I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN GRANTED TO ME? PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW I AM SUPPOSE TO FACE THIS PROBLEM AND TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY AS WELL SINCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THE LARGE COMPANIES TAX BREAKS FOR HAVING THEIR PRODUCTS MADE OVERSEAS AND THEN BROUGHT INTO THE UNITED STATES. I LOST A JOB TO THIS WHEN I WORKING AT QUANTUM. PLEASE BRING OUR JOBS BACK AND GIVE US THE HEALTH CARE THAT YOU PROMISED DURING ALL THOSE SPEACHES. I AM 59 YEARS OLD NOW AND IT IS VERY VERY HARD TO FIND A JOB. BUT MY GRANDCHILDREN NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND ONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

Dear President Obama,
Well, where to start?? The banks, the credit card companies,the health reform issues, or just plain Social Security? There are no more“golden years”AARP suggested a credit card company, and I believed and trusted in AARP, so I opened one, well within a year they have more than tripled my % rate, I always pay my bill before the due date and more than just the interest, just the same, now I can’t pay them at all!! I live on Social Security and this year there will be no cost of living, or should I say no cost of dying raise, oh well that $20 a month would have helped with my prescriptions for Mulitple Sclerosis that I can’t pay for either! So I really don’t know what to do? I helped elect you, I thought maybe, just maybe this is the guy to understand what’s happening and maybe he’ll really make that change, I am still hoping that will be true! I would just check out but I can’t my remaining family couldn’t afford to have me cremated right now, they are in foreclosure and bankruptcy and I really wouldn’t want them to feel bad, and I can’t afford it either, so I’ll have to try to live a little longer, even though I can’t afford to live I can’t afford to die??I am just a drop in the bucket,where do we turn Mr. President??

I am trying to build my life from scratch. I survived human trafficking and domestic violence. After a long wait got my work visa. As I am starting all over, don’t have enough means and resources to commute and keep up with my new job. I had to leave my first job as I had no way to get there. I do need to work, as I love to work and be independent and be recognized because of my work. I am looking forward to keep this new job. Go to school for further education and make something out of myself. In my city the buses stop running by 7.pm, and the last bus to bring me home stops running at 6:10pm. The kc-mo metro does not provide rides anymore because of low funding. I can’t afford to pass on this job as well. I have few kind friends but I just can’t live off them forever. The agency set up to help people like me have been very limited and my case was beyond there understanding. what ever I have accomplished is own my own and great help form legal aid of western Missouri.
I think its my turn to work and pay back all the help I received. I need help to become self sufficient. I am willing to work and earn. I believe there are hundreds of victims like me out there. If a program comes, up that will be great and if most of them start working then per capita income will increase. Therefore it will be good investment.
Please respond to me as I really need help to bring my life back on track. You are my last hope as I have tried all the available options.
Sincerely
Shania

Dear President Obama,
It has been quite a week, with Haiti and the election of Scott Brown to Teddy’s senate seat. (I would say we Democrats were caught napping on that one.)
I am very, very concerned about this latest decision by the Supreme Court to let companies and unions spend as money as they want for political campaignes. You must fight this, do not let this slide.
On health care, offer the republicans one more chance to help craft a sensible bill, if they refuse, then you can go after them they way they have been going after the democrats. No more Mr. Nice guy. But do not lie like they do!

Thank you Mr. President for the wonderful address to the union tonight.
It was disgusting to see Senator McCain, pouting because he lost the race to presidency. His president bashing camera times are showing how difficult he is and will be in supporting your efforts at all.
I am ready to take the steps necessary to change. Even though change can be difficult and scary for some, change is good. I applaude your efforts thus far and wish the republicans would just stop trying to protect their investments and money stashes and start becoming part of the solution instead of the problem.
I hope all involved in helping America to move forward will keep their fears to themselves as well as, their rude and wavering commits to themselves.
I feel it shows how difficult they are and that they do not care for the middle class workers or the poor at all.
You have many great idea’s and I like the way you serve it to those responsible for today’s current situation. I am sorry that you became president after an alcoholic ran the country right down into the hole he creates and has driven America down like all other businesses he has ever been involved in. I know today’s problems were not caused because you took over Presidency. It is unfortunate, that you have to come in behind that disfunction and try to clean it up with a bunch of old timers who are stubborn, self preservating and unruley. I pray that the parties will put aside their differences and quit trying to be better then the other and realize if they don’t get on board with getting your idea’s accepted they will not be there after the next election because no one is going to want those who stood in your way for change to be re-elected. I agree with getting rid of lobbist, they really make a mess out of good reforms by making what they want about how much money can I pad my pocket with. No regard to what it will do when the ripple begins. You are right about the American people losing faith in their Government. Right now we see them eating, bickering, enjoying their suite rooms etc.. while they twiddle their thumbs and running from what they should be facing head on and changing for the poor and the lower class people, but especially the middle class who suffers daily with when is it my turn to hit the streets.
Here in Arizona they complain about being bankrupt with no money to assist our schools and our poor. Yet cave creek homeowner’s do not pay one red penny of property taxes on their multimillion dollar homes or their 20 acre lots. It is unfair that because they own the most prestige homes and land that they pay nothing in property taxes. I pay mine, they should have to pay theirs! In sun city, Arizona the government allowed the eldery their to no longer have to pay taxes that support schools, this too is wrong! Elderly who can not afford to live in Sun City, Arizona still pay taxes to support near by school and are not exempt because they are elderly it’s only where you live. Well, this is what I feel needs to happen.
Cavecreek homeowner’s and any other area’s that are not paying property taxes or school taxes because they live in prestige area’s must pay the same taxes everyone else is paying. This will generate the money that Arizona desperately needs to correct their problems. We do not need to increase a 3% tax on foods or goods that are already to difficult for the working class poor to afford. We need the people with the money to pay their fair share just like we have to.
The elderly in Sun City may not have schools in their area, or kids who attend schools any longer, but they did a one time attend schools paid by property owners and so did their children. So they should pay property taxes that also include school taxes to help out the schools in Arizona.
Republicans too often protect the wealthy or the extremely rich and do nothing to protect the hard working Americans. Even our state is a right to work state so again the rich control our lives and we have no say in the matter. Do we want jobs you bet, do we want to be slaves and under paid not at all. What would these companies do if we all just stopped working for them. Hire oversea’s, oh well they are already doing that because the sanctions were lifted so they could leave america and import their goods at a high cost and make them at a very low cost and low quality. I do not blame job losses on you Mr. President, I blame the loss of jobs on the Republicans and any Democrates who feel trying your idea’s are inappropriate and wish not to support you or respect your position. The grid lock they have created with their petti differences is causing America the beautiful to become another 3rd world country and their very own children and grand children and so on and so fourth will be the one’s to pay for their rebelious behaviors with their very own lives.
Creating clean energy is a must for our world to survive and for us to survive in it. Off shore drilling is not a great thing because it kills our ocean’s and the plants and animal, mammal’s, sea creatures in it. Nucleour is not the right way to go either, please let us not forget the nucleour plant that caused acid rain from russia to pollute our world.
Wind, water and sunlight are given freely let us harness these natural resources that will last forever when we start to respect them and use them to power our world.
Thank you again for you address to the union and I stand with you and believe in your dream for change and hope to see it soon. I will vote for you again even if you don’t get anywhere during this 4 year term, because I believe in your idea’s they make a lot of sense and it is what the hard working American Families need and want from our government!

Dear President,
Well sir i have been in the United States ever since i was like 5 years old. My parents brought me here illegally i don’t blame them because they just wanted the best for me. Well over all these years that i have been in school here in Texas i have learned all your history. I am sad to say all this is not what i have read i honestly thought this was the country of dreams but over the years this country has destroyed a lot of dreams including mine. My dream has always been to travel this country but cant thanks to one law that doesn’t make sense to me. I have been thru a lot of stuff over the years i have gone to school all my life here i am currently 21 years old. Can you Mr. President imagine yourself living more than 10 years hiding and lying to people about your legal status. My parents and i work for this country we give our all because we love this country even when we don’t the love back. We still have faith in this country to change and become that country full of dreams to humans. I am currently attending college and about to finish my career as an Electrician, but what after that what to do. Can you answer that to me. All we ask is to help us good people reach our dreams and contribute more to this country and help this country.

Dear President,
I pray you actually read my comment, and if you do read this thank you for your time sir. Ever since i have been eighteen years old I have always wanted to be a soldier in the united states army, But because of my stupid mistakes that i comitted as a young man now i cant become a soldier. But God knows that I would give everything in my life for the blessing and opportunity to fight for my country i would make it a career. I would do anything i mean anything to become a united states soldier to fix my past mistakes and be proof that people can change. I remember something you said the first week you were president can now i am calling you on it sir. I mean no disrespect; but you said“I am going to show that America is still the land of dreams that a simple man can become anything if given the opportunity. So thank you again sir and God-bless you.

Dear MR. Obama, I’m writing to you in regards to mortgage modification.All my life I have had good credit,However in September 2008 I lost my job and spent 10 month’s trying to become employed again in the auto industry.As you know two American car manufactures applied for bankruptcy during that time period causing my employer to lay me off.When I heard about your plan to use some 75 billion dollars to help many americans such as my self keep there homes I was excited.During my ten months of being unemployed my credit rating has dropped to a level that has effected my ability to modify my mortgage.The reason I’m being denied is called NPV.I am employed now and have been for several months but only at half the pay I was making before.I’m backwards on my mortgage because the value of my house has dropped 50%.My only wish is to remain in my home with my wife and three children.I can make a monthly payment of about half of what I was paying however I’m not being aloud to do so.Modification and NPV should be on the same page but there not.Displacing my family for pennies on the dollar does not make sense when my mortgage company could make more off me!All we want is to remain in our home that we have built and make good on our loan with out being pushed from it.

Its a job that encompasses more than any human could possibly due without feeling tired, overwhelmed and exhausted. Presidency defines your utmost character. Being a young family man adds to this job. Know you are heading in the right direction with health care reform and public option. Take care of ourselves first and then we can be healthy enough to take care of those outside our nucleus. I support your efforts and your causes. I am lucky enough in Alaska to benefit from Alaska Native Health Care along with my teacher retirement insurance.

I am curious what President Obama is waiting for to oblige his promise to the american–“change”. I voted for Obama and I had hoped that he would do what he was voted for. Despite the barrier he’s been going through, he is the president he should overide all against this positive change he wants to make. Right now he is not looking good to anyone as he has to step up and fight, show the americans majority what he was voted for, lowering taxes (great-in the works for working class), health insurance for all, managing big sharks (greedy companies, CEO’s&amp;wall street that are out to destroy&amp;hurt others to their benefit)&amp;promoting&amp;assisting smaller companies&amp;community banks. Just as you had mentioned over and over regarding managing country’s budget, bringing change in the health coverage, reducing taxes–How about getting this done soon! People had faith in you&amp;your ideas when they voted for you, even though we didn’t know much about you, so reinforce it and make it happen. You don’t have much time President Obama, we are still waiting to see what you can do for us. Are you a sayer or a do er? I can’t blame those that have come down hard on you, even though Americans have shown stupidity in the last year since you’ve become the president. They are not looking at the facts but rather following a cult“hate”views. I want a president that will get things done despite barriers. Just like President Bush, he did a lot of things we disapproved but he got them done, he did not allow anybody stopping when he said he would do something, therefore I believe you have the last saying&amp;first response to the american people to honor your promises of change. As a president of the United States you have an obligation to the people to get these things done. So please become the doer and not the sayer and get the american people what you promised them and make history that you’ve never seen before. You were chosen for this for a reason. 1st African American President that has everything to offer, this is your opportunity to make history @ all level–there is nothing better than that! We stand by you! Make it happen!

I am writing to you about retiree health care coverage concerns. I have worked for the same corporation for 31 years, Honeywell, Int’l. and I have always been eligible for employee health care coverage upon retirement, now however I understand that this benefit is soon to go away. However, I will not be eligible for retirement before it ends. Many employees have pre-existing conditions, these illnesses came about after they worked for the company and they really counted on this coverage especially knowing that they have pre-existing conditions.
I know that one of the possible laws of the new health care bill is that employers with more than so many employees should cover their employees health care premiums,is it possible to extend that law to cover employees once they have retired and that have worked for the same company for over 20 or 25 years. I believe that it should be protected just like pensions are today. It was a benefit that we counted on, now we will be forced to work until we are 65+ instead of giving our jobs to younger people, obviously it could solve some of the unemployment issues as well.
Thank you for your time,
Sincerely,
Sandy

Dear Mr. President, I am writing asking why can’t the members of the government higher up take a pay cut? I’m sure they have plenty. We work really hard to pay them. Its the least they can do to return the favor. I work for Bland county&amp;we really cant afford a cut as well as the rest of the educators in the US. It’s very sad that education is being sacrificed considering the children hold the future. It’s very sad that I myself cannot afford a new mattress for myself. The one I sleep on is used. But yet I am blessed to have one at all. I know there are far more less fortunate americans than me but it’s very hard for me to understand. With the small amount of money I make now is still not enough. I will probably owe taxes this year even with me claiming zero. How much more can any one on the lower level take? Please help us little guys, the big guys have plenty. If it werent for us they would not have nothing. But it seems they just want more. Thank you for your time

Dear President Obama
I am writing this letter because I am a 48 year old widow. Have worked since I was 13 and still employeed. I am in much need of a home improvement grant. I’ve tried saving money to get home repairs but it seems I like so many working people live paycheck to paycheck, or what little I do save my hot water tank needs replaced, furnance breaks down and needs repaired, or need to buy my granddaughter shoes or clothes for school because her mom is also struggling to make ends meet. I have done searches for free home improvement grants and it always says purchase this or purchase that. My home is in such need of improvements, need new furnance, new bathroom so many essential things need done. I’ve thought about just letting it go into forecloser and just living in a apartment were the landlord could make repairs. But Iam to proud of a person to do that. Please help me.

Dear Mr. President, As one of your most ardent supporters in the fight for health care reform, I come to you with a story that is both urgent and relavent. Last week my assistant brought me a CT scan to review on his nephew, a promising 19 year old college student here in Florida. It crushed my heart to see that this young boy had a soft tissue sarcoma that had spread throughout his body. But that feeling was nothing compared to sorrow and disbelief I felt when I was told that the Sylvester Cancer Center here in Miami had denied him treatment today and discharged him to die without hope and in significant pain. Imagine the desolation he feels knowing that he is being abandoned because of lack of ability to pay. Imagine the heartbreak of his parents having to take him home to die and trying to exlain the heartlessness of a country willing to bury him in the prime of his life. As a parent, I know you can intimately relate to that pain. Right now you have the power to save the life of this boy and so many others like him. Use his face and his story to connect with my fellow citizens . Let them know that they can save his life and preserve the sanity of his parents and friends by doing something now! In a case like this a few weeks can be vital and decide whether we will be going to his graduation or his funeral. With treatment his potential servival rate is 65%. Without insurance, it is 0. Please help.

Dear President Obama -
I have been a citizen of the state of Colorado since 1964 when I moved here at the age of 21 and became a registered Democrat. I have seen a lot of senators come and go in that time, some Republican and some Democrat, as well as a lot of governors and presidents, for that matter. I have remained a good and active Dem. In 2008, I stumped for you, talking to hundreds of voters about how someone could succeed with your approach, running a person-to-person grassroots campaign, encouraging people to give what they could, even if only $1! I stood in line for 2 1/2 hours to claim my seat (a volunteer perk!) to see and hear you accept the nomination at the Pepsi Center. My husband and I worked the crowd at the Denver Civic Center before making our way to the front to wait for you to speak at that rally and shake your hand. We were and remain today supportive of what you are trying to accomplish. I have argued to countless people that your ideals are high, but you are learning that one can’t rely on a bipartisan approach to getting things done. I continue to argue that the important thing in the health care controversy is to pass something and yes, we know it will be amended and changed over and over again for many years (Read the history of the Social Security Act!). I have argued to the doubters that 2010-2011 will be very different, much for the better.
The one thing that I cannot support is your insistence on getting involved in the Colorado race for the US Senate! In all my years in Colorado, I cannot recall a sitting president becoming involved before the Primary election. I could go into a lot of detail of the mistake that Governor Ritter made in appointing Michael Bennet, rather than Andrew Romanoff, who happened to enjoy huge popularity and success in the Colorado legislature and was, unfortunately for the citizens of Colorado, term-limited. Through direction from your administration or some other avenue, he appointed Bennet and hung Andrew Romanoff, the obvious choice of active Dems,“out to dry!”Now
that it is clear that Andrew is still the people’s choice–he (like you in 2008) is relying on small and not-so-small contributions from individuals, not corporations like WalMart and Pfizer. The fact that the Supreme Court has given its blessing to unlimited giving to campaigns does not make it right–Unfortunately, the“smell”will be with us for a long time.
I urge you and members of your administration to stay out of Colorado politics until after the Primary in August. I will continue to do everything I can to help Andrew win that race and the election in November, which he will do handily against whichever Republican opponent wins that Primary election (He is already polling better than Bennet again either one!).

CRITICAL TIMES HARD TO DEAL WITH…
Mr. President,
It is disgusting how Veteran Affairs treat some Viet Nam veterans who were exposed to the poison agent orange. My son was born with severe lower extremities of his right leg and foot. he has been treated with casts, and surgery at age 4 months. His father (the veteran)has underlying problems that only a professional would be able to reveal. We did not have medical insurance when the son was born in 1983. The orthopaedic surgeon offered his service free for the weekly office visits and the surgery. The veteran apparently did not know to apply for benefits or was to proud hearted to help his son. I applied for benefits for my son and later my son also filed a claim. About three claims have been denied. VA has a law stating that only female veterans who served in Viet Nam would qualify for benefits because certain birth defects only occur in the female’s birth canal. WELL LAUDY DEE…Someone does not know what God’s word say that through one man, God made all nation of men and also after Jehovah created the woman, Adam exclaimed..At last, this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. What else needs to be said. The woman comes from the man. The Viet Nam war still lives on and scars the veteran and his family–children and grandchildrens.

Why don’t you look at our Guys that have child support thaat wa back when times were good. Our CSF make up their owr laws . Takes 6 months or more for a court date ( I know some that have been waiting for 4 years ) just to make a change. If they can’t get a job , they go to jail . If they get a job and child support takes their check , then they have not money to go to work. If they have a job and get behind ( they go to jail ). Is this starting to feel like we are going in circles . People need someone to help them get back on track not just worry on how they are going to pay for yur Health Plan . Thank You for at least maybe your time .

Dear Mr. President,
My name is Ryan A. May. I am a 19 year old living in Alabama. I am attending college for the first time in this coming fall. However my father is a small business owner and with the economic recession his business has fallen on extremely hard times and we are stuggleing to keep the doors open, much less make profit. If the economy does not get better soon I wont be able to pay for my college due to extremely high cost of tuition and other expsenses that are related to higher education. I am very scared to take out a student loan because I do not want to be in dept for the rest of my life! I would join the military but I just cant fight in a war I dont believe it! You say children are the future and education is the gate way to success! Well if thats the case then prove it by making college affordable! Why should American CITIZENS be punished when illegal aliens get it for next to free? Please create more jobs and work on fixing the economy so I can go to college and be the future that american so desperately needs!

Dear President Obama and The Carter Center,
Although, we do appreciate your Center’s efforts, an overwhelming number of Sudanese are astonished to learn that, despite the fact that your report has clearly indicated that the recent elections in Sudan“fall short of international standards,”it continued to say that most of the international community will“recognize”them! For the Sudanese people, this insinuates that, since Sudan is an African country, what do Africans know about democracy? Hence, even though your elections fell short of international standard, the same international community would accept them. These elections have been blatantly rigged and fraud accompanied every step of its way as I am sure you have witnessed. Ample evidence is available including eye witnesses that the Carter Center could have consulted. The assumption now in Sudan is that the Carter Center, perhaps inadvertently, used employees who are loyal to the dictatorial system and thus gave flawed reports to the Center. Others claim that translators were poor. This election was a one man show, and in this sense, what is the difference between the Bashir who overthrew a democratically-elected government and the current Bashir who wants to rape the rule after 21 years as a military dictator? Many think, the U.S and the Carter Center care less for Sudan, but are only interested in the separation of the South given the oil fields in the South. I wish to think otherwise and continue on my perception of the Carter Center as a genuine institution that helps oppressed people in the word gain freedom, full democracy, and good life for the children, life that is free of war after so many years of oppression, torture, and damage that this criminal regime has afflicted the country with for 21 years. We do deserve a better life and treatment dear Mr. President. As the first U.S. resident from African origin, we had great hopes that you would help the African people get rid of dictatorships, totalitarianism, war, and poverty. We hoped that you would help establish democracy, genuine democracy not through rigged elections to re-instate the same military dictator who has been in power for over 20 years and is only trying to legitimize this dictatorship through fraud. But the Sudanese people have a long and proud history of overthrowing military dictatorships single-handedly.
Dear Mr. President: The Sudan is perhaps the only African country with a well-established multi-party system. Our country has witnessed two fair and clean elections in 1965 and 1986 respectively. The latter that established the third genuine democracy in the Sudan was the one that was illegally overthrown by general Bashir on June 30, 1989 when he established his military totalitarian dictatorship for over 20 years thus far inflicting war crimes on the Sudanese people throughout the country. Primarily, and given all this, the overwhelming majority of the Sudanese people are astonished that the U.S. and the Carter Center would even think of accepting Bashir to be a candidate in this election. An individual wanted by the International Tribunal Court for war crimes should not be allowed to rig elections to legitimize his totalitarian, dictatorial rule to afflict more misery on the helpless Sudanese people who, single-handedly through civil disobedience, and popular uprisings overthrew two military dictatorships on October 21, 1964 (the October Revolution), and April 6, 1985 (the April Uprising), respectively; and they will do it again sooner or later. Thank you for your efforts.
Sincerely,
Dr. Souad Taj

Please, please, please Mr. President, I know that you recieve thousands of letters every day but please take the time and read mine. I am a 47 year old African American woman. I have gone to college but have not been able to complete because of financial issues due to a bad marriage. Over the years I have been trying to find a decent job to pay off my old debts but have been able to. I have been told that due to bad credit I could not obtain employment with certian companies. To me I think this is unfair. My credit issues were not total caused by my myself and not purposely created. I should not be denied decent employment because of it. Please pass a bill that will encourage companies to hire people with credit issues. I am not a bad person or a criminal. I just have some credit problems because of things that have happened to me in my past and it has been following me every since. How can I make enough money to pay off old debts when now one will hire me on a job paying enough to pay off my debts and therefore causing me to go further in debt. I have gone to college have not been able to finish because of a student loan I cannot pay back. All I need is a decent job. I Recently got engaged and my fiance had a stroke a month ago here in miami florida. When we got his hospital bill back it was $109,000 which is another debt that i have encured. How are we going to pay that bill. Please pass the bill that allow busines owners to hire people with bad credit as long as they are not a criminal. All I need is a chance to prove myself and a chance to pay off my debts. As long as people in debt are denied good jobs they are going to continue to go into debt which is bad on the economy.

Mr. President do we have to wait 1 or 2 years for respond from Bank of America on the short sale offers? Nobody is helping or answering from that bank and the borrowers walked away from the contracts.Should banks help people to do short sale or they don’t care? Do we have to walk away from our home and let the banks do foreclosure?It is not our fault that we paid $240,000 for the house in 2005 and it is going only for $130,000 now. Mr.President, can You ask the Bank of America to respond on short sale faster to not let borrowers walk away from the contracts?

Mr. President Obama,
First I’d like to share the above video with you. It is the most feasible and safe way to get the oil out of the Gulf without harming any anaimals or plant life. We The People are sick of hearing how no solution has been reached at all in this matter.
Furthermore, I’d like to know where your administration gets their percentages when surveying the current unemployment matter. I find it not only offensive, but also remarkably false. We are NOT the upper class of greed, where jobs are not an issue. We do not have the time or money to be able to call a pleasant luncheon whenever we feel like it. We are the middle to lower class, who work and have worked really hard to make our economy what it used to be. Sadly and truthfully, the majority who have become the lower class, were the very ones who were a part of the middle class. Running once successful businesses, which was not handed to us on a silver platter, but worked for and grown from a ground up. Then the falling economy caused those very grounds to shake and crumble w/o warning. The aftershock following such a decline, were lost jobs, barely making ends meat and feeding our families, to foreclosures that lead to our now new tent communities.
Now this new Health Care Bill you forced to pass (&lt;that&apos;s how I look at it personally) has shook our worlds upside down in the worst way! It was not bad enough we found ourselves layed off from a job we sacrificed many years on, or brought small businesses that provided employment to many communities in many states across our great country, and eventually out of work and a roof over our families heads. No. Now even those people are facing the fact they cannot afford something more. Your Health Care. How in Hades do you expect the homeless, and anyone else who are barely making the bills and a loaf of bread to ration out among their children to afford this HC you made law? How? There is hope among chaos, where Hope WILL win out. In the meantime, you must know these people deserve so much more than this. Your HC bill and w/e else you have up your sleeve does not work for the people at all. We need a bailout too.
Moreover, how do you sleep at night knowing so many may die because they cannot afford all of this mess, after all was already stripped from them before your bill was ever presented to the masses? What if this were your children in such a situation? What if they could no longer enjoy eating nice Rhubarb pies with their families at a nice family dinner table, let alone a piece of bread to eat?
I just thought I&apos;d liberate my mind for myself, as well as advocate for the rest of the many Americans I see homeless, or barely making it under the same sky we all live under. You are the President of our Nation. And I hope you do the right thing. I really hope you do more than sleep on this and many more issues currently at hand.
Without The People, there is no Nation to govern/rule. Please remember that next time you hear of someone&apos;s child/grandparents found dead from heat exhaustion this summer.
In closing I&apos;d just like to let you know, you&apos;re forgiven. We are rooting for you though. We are hoping you are the one who helps the People of this Great Nation you now have the burden of. Hope is NOT gone.
Thank you,
J.P.

Dear Mr. President
Why have our political leaders missed a golden opportunity to create a healthcare system that works for all parties involved, the American people, the healthcare providers and last and rightly least insurance companies. Our country continues to dance to the tune of the almighty dollar. Let us dumb the system down, let the insurance companies’ battle with each other for our business. Case and point the Medicare prescription drug plan. Let’s do away with the“part D”and include prescription drugs in the Part B plan benefits. Make it and 80/20 payout, increase the Part B premium a little as the average Part D premium is roughly $30.00 a month. Lose the“donut hole”or coverage gap and force the insurance companies to bid for the contracts and offer reasonable coverage to our seniors and disabled as we currently do with the Part A and Part B contractors on a state by state basis. Medigap policies could then“reform”themselves and include as part of one of the many plans available the option of offering coverage for the 20% not covered under the Part B plan. The absolute last people on earth that should be struggling are our seniors our disabled and our children. Providers are walking away from the Medicare program due to reimbursement rates, seniors opt out of prescription and in some cases Part B coverage due to cost. Insurance companies that have either been contracted by Medicare to process claims or have been approved to provide prescription drug coverage have been some of the biggest contributors to the fraud and exploitation of the system and have gotten away with millions of taxpayers’ dollars and have left senior in the lurch with nightmare premium and coverage issues.
If we are designing a healthcare system that is truly affordable and accessible, then move the insurance lobbyist aside and let them beg for our Business, we are consumers, taxpayers and voters. Your heart is in the right place, but where do you get your information from? Simplify. I could say more, but enough is enough. Wow, you have a lot on your plate and I admire the fact that you do not rant and rave, nor place blame. I continue to believe you have our best interest at heart, keep the faith! It might be that you will never read this but it’s nice to have the opportunity to voice an opinion. Thanks.

Dear President Obama,
I know that you’re busy with the duties of the White House. I sure hope that you can help me with this matter. My husband and I are both disabled. The landlord in which we rent property from for our mobile home has decided to close the property down to any renter cause they can’t keep the place up and gave us until July 31, 2010 to move off the property. Now they’re giving us 2 weeks until we have to be moved due to them not gettng their rental money. My husband explained to the owner that we was both disabled and having a hard time finding another place to move the mobile home. His reply was that it wasn’t his problem. We can’t borrow money due to us both being disabled and on a limited income. I’ve tried to find assistance to help us with land that we can put the mobile home on so that we won’t have to move again once the home is set up. Haven’t found anyone that can help. I tried to find assistance to move the mobile home but couldn’t find any help there as well. I am frustrated with all this and do not know what else to do. Do you have any thoughts on what we can do? Time is running out and was told that if they have to they would move the mobile home off their property and charge us for the services. HELP PLEASE!!!!!

Dear Pres Obam,
I have an idea to merge HUD with KW Cares/Pepsi .org. Using monies from KW Cares, Pepsi refresh.or and your fudning sources, why can’t we help displaced families move into forelcosed proeprties and subsidize theri utilieis, while they revitalize the house andneighborhood. Results would be monitored and evaluated. A rating scale could determine if that family ( or single person) would remain inthe program. This saves the displaced persons from going to a shelter and being on welfare. It is a working employement idea; an improvement; a win win for many people, neighborhoods,feddie and fannie HUD REO/s. The banks could play as well in this game, usingt heir vast inventory.

Dear Mr. President Obama;
I don’t know where to start with my letter. I’ve thought many times on writing you, but I thought that you didn’t have time to read our letters, but I saw on the web that you do. Mr. President, I’m not sure that you will get my letter, but here goes anyway. I am a 60-year old black divorced woman, I have been unemployed for 11/2 years now, and just recently started getting my unemployment, which is about to end in 4 weeks. I have lived for months on the minimum of things. At the same time I’ve been job hunting, any kind of job, McDonalds, Wendy’s just any knid of job. I’ve always done office work, but thats next to impossible to get. I’ve applied to every place in Dallas. I don’t know if my former job is giving bad refence (I was employed there for 21 years) or my age is discriminated against ora felony that I got 30 years ago or what the problem is. But I see the bag women on the street and I can somewhat understand. I am a divorcee with no kids, my siblings have their own kids and problem, I can’t ask them for anything. But the bottom line with me is that I only want a job, anything that will pay my rent. I had to give up my home because I couldn’t afford it. With apartments the only thing you have to worry about is the rent. Now that is a problem. Mr President, Why isn’t there something in place for us older Americans, people that has worked all their lives, and can’t even have a good nights rest, without worrying about paying rent. I could really use your help, maybe if you could talk to people here, change the laws or something, I could write allday on improvements, but you are who we chose and you are our leader, I trust and believe everything you do, I am a Christian and believe in God, so I will just say back and let my 2 best men handle and do their job. Mr President we love you. Keep doing what you doing and keep your faith in God.

Dear Mr. President,
My husband recently retired at age 66 after years of working as a dentist. We have had a good life but not a life I would characterize as full of riches (of the monetary kind). I worked in the office as well often 10 hours a day to get all that we needed done.
Our concern is that we are now hearing that our health care benefits will be decreased because we have saved and planned for our retirement years. For that we should be punished? My health insurance plan which costs me about $9,600 a year for me alone (my husband is on Medicare and a supplemental plan with Blue Cross), is not a“cadillac”plan. I have a $3,000 deductible and wind up paying most everything myself because I do not reach the deductible amount. But I don’t consider going without insurance because of my age and health problems. We have always had to carry our own health insurance because of being self-employed. It has always been in my opinion“good only if you were dying because otherwise you would never reach the deductible”.
We do not feel we should be taxed additional money for my“cadillac”(your term–not mine and certainly not the reality) plan.
We cannot fathom why you want to hurt people who have worked hard all their lives. We, neither one, started on easy street and have worked hard all our lives–does that make us the bad guys?
It is a sad day when you punish those who have worked hard because others have been unable to make it. Where is the justice in that?
I know it is hard to try to find all the answers but I just hope you look at both sides of the issues before making decisions that adversely affect those who are not large problems now but could become so if they are taxed out of being okay.
Sincerely, Dianne Christensen

Dear President Obama,
I have never written to the President of the wonderful USA. But I guess its time for me to send this.
I am a registed Nurse and have been since 1991. I worked on my Dad’s farm till I was 14 and then took a fulltime job, plus went to school and tried to be a normal teenager that is if there is one! But basically worked all my life.
Here is my dilemma, I have lived in my home since 1993…..yes last 17 years and now I owe 2.7 years on my home.I lost my brother to an act of ciolence and had a mental break dow. And within a week my husband of 25 years filed for a divorce and that was a terrible hardship on me as the doctor’s would not let me work until my medications were straightened out, it has been a trial for me.
When my husband left he left me 3 months past due on my mortgage. He had all mu utilities were turned off as they were in his name. I lost my job last August as a travel nurse in California. At that time my morgage was up to date. I have tried working with Regions and the VA. I got a certified letter from the VA stating that my home had benn sold..guess who got it the people who were holding my mortgage. Regions Bank, they have led me on and my attorney. I owe a whopping 27,500 dollarsabout 2.7 years. Now I find that they bought it out from under me. I believe it was an arrangement between VA and Regions. Where is the help you promised to keep people in their home. I have 10 days to leave. I have no where to go..so I have a tent that I will be living in. Oh what fun since I live in Alabama. Our heat has been record in heat index. I believed in you, that you would stand behind people like me who have worked paid taxes and obeyed the law.
I don’t know why I wrote this because I am sure that you have more pressing things to deal with and my plight is of no concern, thats obvious by what the VA and Regions have done.
Sorry this is such a bleak letter, but I get jeaalous when people get Habitate for Humanity to build and give them a home. This is what I have a HOME and was the only thing that gave me any sense of belongin. I love my country and I love my state.
Just maybe you will read this and make my choices good ones. Cause at this point it does not look very good. I want to know why they would not work with me and have been closed to trying to help. I have an appraisal on my home and the land alone is worth more than what Regions got it for.
But you continue doing what your doing, but be aware what you have tried to do for homeowners is travesty.

America , I can understand all the anger and frustration directed at BP, but for the life of me I can’t wrap my mind around this anger towards the President. We are dealing with a disaster of the magnitude of which no other administration has ever had to deal with . BP had no contingency plan for the dept of such a disaster. We all know that deep water or offshore drilling has been going on for decades with no real significant problem. To add this unprecedented disaster to the plate of this President at a time when he’s dealing with two wars, an economic situation that is starting to show real signs of stabilizing but still is up and down, Crisis developing between Israel and Palestine’s, Iran , Korea, Terrorist and a never ending attack from those who’s total desire is to cripple this President and his administration . I say President Obama is handling himself very well. We elected a President who’s calm and steady demeanour was what we were looking for, not someone who flies off the handle and make irrational decisions without thinking. I for one am very comfortable with this President’s level of calmness, for me, it is reassuring and comforting. President Obama stated and I quote”I can’t go down and plug the hole up myself, and I can’t take a straw and suck all of the oil out”I conquer. He can’t snap his fingers or wave a magic wand and stop this oil leak no more than those who are criticizing him can do anything except flap their gums. The job of the President is to weigh all of the facts and suggestions from a whole host of experts in this matter, and come up or reach a conclusion that will best rectify the situation. His job is not to allow the nay Sayers and all of the negative talk deter him from his focus to get the job done right. Everything that can possibly be done I’m sure is or will be done to stop this leak sooner rather than later. America, instead of complaining and criticizing, try localizing a cleanup coalition in your states and get on a bus , plane, train, bicycle or scouter and assist in the cleanup . Put all of that energy to good use, put up or shut up!, I want to end this by saying that even though this president is feeling a little stress right now, he is still a thousand time better in a Crisis on his worst day, than his predecessor was on his best day. I’m just saying!.

Lets get real!
America! Do you really expect this President and his Administration to correct all of the Crap ! the previous administration did in just Two short years!? Are you serious!!?. The state this country is in, took over a decade or so, of Tax cuts for the wealthiest 3% of Americans to the detriment of the middle and lower class; not to mention the poorest of the poor! I mean com on!! Did we forget that when President Obama took office , his predecessor had taken this Country from a Robus surplus too the worst deficit since the great depression!!? Lets examine all of President Obama accomplishments shall we!. With the passage of the stimulus package the economy has started to turn around slowly but surely. After decades of trying and failing, to get comprehensive health care legislation passed , he did. after numerous blockage of regulatory reform attempts, he has just pass the largest over hall of our regulatory system in history. Despite all of the negative, and dare I say hatred towards him , This President has achieved in two short years , more than any other President in our Countries history, and yet he’s not satisfied nor are his supporters. Despite making history from the onset of his presidency til date! The polls are what everyone is harping on! The Party of no has no answers as to how they will or can do any better however, all I here from them, is a whole lot of who shot john!! If it was up to them, we would still be hemorrhaging economically and emotionally. I know that the job growth is not where this Administration wants it to be, but is is growing which is more than I can say about it before this administration took office. I’d like to know if the American people realize that once again the party of no! the Republicans have recently blocked the passage of extending unemployment benefits to all of those people who are still suffering , and looking for work. Can any body explain too me why? In fact they have fought this administration from the beginning with a little history making of their own‘Filibustering’!!! all in an attempt to cripple this administration. I think when Americans really look at where we are as appose to where we where! they really will have a choice to make. Whether they want to revert back too the Bush error or continue on the path towards making us competitive, by strengthening our position in the world. I think the latter is the obvious choice. Come November, we really will have a choice, don’t let it be the wrong choice. I’m Just saying.

The accomplishments you have achieved in less than 2 years , well cannot be compared to any other sitting President in our country’s history. For that I say Bravo!

You are a mystery to some but a Failure to non where I’m from. I think because you are One of a kind, the oppisition can not put you in a box, therefore it is their desire to cripple you and your adminstrion any way they can. You contine to be the Strong African Price&amp;Warrior that you are. And know that your supporters are in the trenches fighting right with you. Peace&amp;love to you, your family and your administration. God bless you&amp;God bless the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Dear Mr. President.
I live in California,almost 60 and still one of your soldiers, I have lots
of experiances in our Service to our country and as a Vet; There is little good to say. I am woried about the profound ebalance there will be when our soldiers start to return from the war. Worst they are now in a hole that they can’t dig out. It’s bad if they stay and it’s bad if they come back. Worst is that we are puting our good eggs into a bad basket because it has a very big hole in the bottom and it’s not geting any better. Here in this country we are still contracting out of country WE MUST STOP OR TURN OF THE OUT FLOW OF ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO FORIGEN LAND or tighten the up contracts, turn them around to this country and set it for about the same as payment over seas
bare in mind there are no jobs and I bet right now people are not going to sceam about how much money they are geting paid. they’d rather have a job.
Automotive corperations should start hireing and put people to work or did they not get money to stay alive???
Bank firms and other corperations that recieved Gov. money don’t they ow the people something in the form of jobs???? I am looking too but I have tenure and look forward in Civil Service and hope that I may make a difference by spending what I make and shore up accounts that will float on interests and look into County and City stocks I think if people could own a little of the town they live in things would go better…

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT OBAMA,
GREETINGS TO YOU. WHY IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION NOT SUPPORTING ISRAEL? WHY IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION ASKING TELLING ISRAEL TO STOP BUILDING IN JERUSALEM? JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, NOT A SETTLEMENT.WHY IS ISRAEL BEING SINGLED OUT? WHY DID YOU LEAVE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER Binyamin Netanyahu TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY, AND REFUSING PHOTOGRAPHS? THIS IS A DIRECT MESSAGE TO AMERICAN AND ISRAELI ENEMIES THAT WE ARE NO LONGER WITH ISRAEL.THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY.

Dear Mr.President,I am so proud to say yes I voted for you,You and your group of healers are getting it done!I do have one small problem and need your help,if possible.I was under medicare both the part A&amp;B,but wanted to change over to the Kaiser plan here on the Big Island,only dum thing is when I was under my dads health plan ,&amp;while working for the telephone co. on Oahu the Kaiser plan paid or covered all meds&amp;doctor fees.So I quit the medicare,but then Kaiser told me oh,no,I still needed the medicare .I went down to the Social Security here in Hilo,and was told to register again.I did and had to have it in on a date.I did that,got the Part A,but was told I was not showing up on the computer and needed to reapply for Part B.I was then sent a card from SS stating that as of July 1,2010 I would have the part B coverage.I got sick in July and was told I had had no Part B to help with the coverage.Went to the SS office,they told me I was’t on and cannot get to sign up til December.If I wasn’t covered how is it I got the Part A,when I put in for both plans the same time?I really think I need help and pray you will read this for my sake!Thank you for your time and god bless you and yours.Great Job!G.M.

DearMr.PresidentObama Hi i just want to
say that you are a very nice guy and
that you are doing a great job .But
there is a problem that is not right
and nobody is saying nothing about it
and the police think they can put
the immigrants in their place .Well i
think that it is not rigt that they can
do that .Dosen’t it say in the statue of
liberity bring me your weak and young and old.
But it seems that things are differnt
don’t we see that they are poor and
are without money and that’s why they
come to work here so they can have a
better life here but everytime i here
the new’s it’s alway’s about the
immigrants and that they need to go back
home where they came from .Well if that
will be true that means every one who
comes from different country’s will have
to go back then like the german’s and so
on .I ask that you take into
consideration that we need to change
for the better and not the worst .
Thank you for your time .

Dear President Obama,
I am sure that my comment won’t reach you, but have to give it a try anyway. I am a singe mother with a 16 year old son. I lost 2 jobs due to plant closings and recently exausted all of my unemployment benefits. I have been job hunting for 2 years and can’t find anything, have even applied for jobs that I didn’t even want, but trying to make ends meet. Now there is no money to go job hunting on, not that there was much left even on unemployment, we did without some things just so I would have gas to hunt a job. Something has to give soon or we will lose everything and will be living in our car. I have always worked and don’t know what else to do. I never dreamed that we would be in the shape we are today. Would dig ditches even at my age if job was available. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest anyway. Yours Sincerely, Kim

Dear Mr. President Obama
I am writing this letter to say good job Mr. President you are doing your very best. I believe you really have genuine concern for this wonderful country. and I pray that god give you strength to carry out all of your good plans for this country.I am sorry to say us American do not appreciate everything we have in this wonderful country only complain. We are so use to things given to us that we have forgotten what is the meaning of word United, means in United Stated of America? Instead of everyone working hard and taking responsibility for there action looking at government for free hand out. I pray people open their eyes and see that they are in a wonderful land and all need to do is to work hard and believe.my name is Maleeha I cam to this wonderful country from Pakistan in 1989 with my parents and 4 sibling due to difficult times in Pakistan for Ahmadi Muslims. My family was barely making ends meet because of our religion. And our life was threatened everyday. But come to us we all have work very hard and are stable can practice our religion and live free. When we came to use we lived in one bed Room studio for few months someone complained in the city that too many people living in this house this is a fire hazard. City of Fitchburg officials came to our home and offered us welfare and better housing, but my parents refused they instead asked if you can help us find a job. I was so proud of my family since then all of us have never asked for anything and always tried to stand on our feet with our hard work. Mr. President I Know you have so much on your shoulders my Ahmadi brothers in Pakistan are suffering and recent booming the mosque in Lahore left 100 families without loved ones. And now with flood people who deserve aid not getting it all foreign aid is being eaten buy government and in some case as I am told by friends, flood victims have to purchase their aid that was suppose to be given to them for free. I don’t know if there are laws that can make sure aid get to people not government since we haven’t had and good government for as long as I can remember. Most politicians that has held any government seat in Pakistan, only made it worst for the country and made Pakistanis look bad around the world. We are very gullible but loving people. Sorry took so much of your busy time. Hopefully you can do something about rights for Ahmadis in Pakistan.

Dear Mr. President- I am going to keep this short and sweet we understand those who need health insurance but has anyone thought about life insurance. It so frustrating when you are turned down time after time just because you are totally disabled. There is one question what are we to do who our love ones past on dig a ditch and throw them in? They will not give special people life insurance but they are giving it to others who are strung out on drugs and everything else I think this is sicking when special needs are living longer than the so-call healthy ones. Please help our family so that we may lift this burden off our mind which is driving me mentally, physically, and emotionally in sane.
Thank You,

Are You Kidding Me!
America, the Republicaint’s has just release their mission statement!! , whaaaat a surprise! Their goal is to revert back to the exact same policies that did such a banged up job during the last administration, that we all were prospering so well from right!!?, I mean are you kidding me !!!? Lets examine the so called contract with America , shall we! prior too the start of this Administration , we where for lack of a better words ! up the proverbial creek with out a paddle, a boat, or a life jacket! The poorest of the poor was getting even poo er, while the Wall street fat cats and big business as well as the riches of the rich where enjoying unprecedented gains in the market. People were loosing their jobs, savings and their homes at a record pace. Thousands of Americans were either under-insured or had no insurance at all because of deregulation, which allowed the Insurance and Financial community to run a muck; not to mention huge tax cuts for the top 1% Money Earners and Big Business, Two Wars which by the way was not paid for,! All while leaving an almost 2 Trillion dollar deficit. What a helluva Job!!!. This false concern about spending, deficits and big government is just a smoke screen . Basically their solutions is to continue the same failed policies, and expect a different outcome. This notion that the policies put in place by the current Administration , will cause Big businesses to move jobs out is ludicrous, think about it America ! if that was the case then maybe they can explain why we were loosing more jobs before the policies were in placed?!! Small businesses are the ones that are greasing the wheels of job growth in the market, the policies the Republicans propose to revert back too, in my opinion will change the direction of the country not for the better. Even though Americans are still in a recovery phase, things are getting better. America if you truly feel that we where better off under the policies of the previous administration, then vote to go backwards, but if you feel that Thousands of American deserve a better life rather than a life of continual suffering then join us in moving this country forward. The choice is yours I’m Just Saying.! Mr. president I and my family are behind you ad this administration 100%.

I was wondering why we do not have a memorial for all of our soldiers who have died as a direct result from a conflict.For example,I lost my dad 2 years ago from cancer to which he contracted from agent orange while he was in viet nam.My father was a terrific man,I would not be who i am today if not for him.He bestowed morals and values into my life and taught me responsibility as well as respect.He was my Hero,and I miss him dearly.Last year Me and my wife and stepmother,and my children visited our nations Capitol,and visited THE WALL,something he has always wanted to do.We had him with us in thought and i believe in spirit as well.But as We looked over those names carved in stone,i couldnt help but think his shouldve been up there as well.I mean he didnt loose his life over there so to speak,and he did make it home to us,but he did lose his life because of that place.His name was Calvin Ray Dowell,and I loved him very much and just wanted to share these thoughts with whomever wishes to read this.Thank you,sincerely,Roger T Dowell.

Hi my name is Matt&amp;im writing to you, to see if u could fix the problem with unemployment&amp;with child support. I am trying to do the right thing here by paying my child support, but when I get layed off in the winter I cannot afford to pay the child support and the rest of my bills. The wages I recive from unemployment barely meet’s my rent&amp;I cannot get help from the state with food stamps. We can only use the food banks 12 times a year and by the time winter starts we have no times left. So while you are fixing things could you at least look into possibly fixing this problem too. I am well aware that you are a very busy&amp;important man, if you could take some time to look into this, it would be apperciated.

Dear Mr. President,
I am writing to express my great displeasure at your wishy-washy position on extending Bush era tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans (annual income $250 thousand plus) . We cannot begin to address our deficit problems (even if we cut spending to the bone) without a tax increase and what better class of governmental beneficiaries than those who have benefited most from the opportunities our nation fosters.
Don’t let us down, Mr. President. The time has come to fulfill your 2008 campaign promises in this regard. It is hard to imagine anything that could hurt your chances for reelection more, as many of your most ardent and affectionate supporters, including my wife and I, will feel unable to continue our support if you do not do all in your power to get the job done and get us headed back on the road to a future that holds promise for all of us. Help us help you. We know you can do it.
Thank you, Mr. President.

Dear President Obama,
I am SO very disappointed that you have caved once again to the Republicans! When you campaigned, you told all of us that we were going to see change“we could believe in.”I believed in you and so did my husband. How were we so misinformed? You took on John McCain and totally whipped his butt! Then after you got into the Whitehouse, you changed in to a wimp! I am not a black woman, but I was so hopeful that you were going to make changes for every person in the poor and middle class. I’ve totally lost hope in you. My husband and I are so disgusted with your constant“enabling”that we don’t even want to vote for you again.
I’m upset that you are letting the Republicans extort you on the extension of the Bush Tax cuts and also on doing something for the 99ers. Don’t you realize these guys want you out in 2012? They’ve done everything to degrade you and your family; they’ve called you a Muslim; they’ve said you weren’t born here; and I can go on and on. Why would you insist on continuing a relationship with them? They have even betrayed the Tea Partiers that said they want less government involvement in our lives.
I’m starting to think you’re a Republican in Democrat clothing! You haven’t done much for the millions who made sure you got where you are today and that’s very sad to see.

Dear Mr. President I write you today nearly in tears that you could not stand with the american people on the tax cuts.Dissapointment does not began to discribe how I feel.The american people are stronger than you give us credit for.You promised to listen to the people but you do not.The republicans played a game of poker with you and won.The lyrics to the gambler describes perfectly how you got played.This is a sad day for hard working americans.Even if it meant no tax cuts we would take it ,stand on principle.

Dear Mr. President,
I thought when you signed the bill to extend unemployment benefits for the unemployed, that it was for all unemployed people. I just received an email from my state employment agency saying once I have ended the 86 weeks of unemployment benefits, that I would not receive any of the unemployment benefits that you have just signed into law. This is grossly misleading and unfair. My unemployment benefits are about to end and there continue to be people losing jobs in this city considered the air capital of the world. The aircraft industry is the back bone of this city and it has crumbled terribly. How can people like myself continue to pay bills, insurance, and buy food without the help of the unemployment benefits? Why did everyone mislead people into thinking we would get an additional 13 months of unemployment, when it is not true? I really thought you had come through for us, but I have only been disappointed once again. Maybe you can send me $363 a week out of your pay so I don’t go under. Sincerely, Kathy Barber from Kansas.

This country is going through a time of need, we need to solve the unemployment problem and at the same time protect oueselves against terrorisem, we need to rebuild our infra- structure. Our children are obease and stuck to computer games. Our education structure leaves alot to be desired and the respect of the youth today for country and athority is at an all time low. So where do we start to correct these problems? I think a solution is to increas our military man power, train these young people in fields to inhance our safety and help rebuild the foundation of our infrastructure. this would solve many problems faceing our society, not only would it teach respect but build self confidence in our younger generation, Educate them in the military and get them in shape. God bless America

Dear, Mr. President Obama
Why the short sale is impossible to do ?
The bank is responding very slow,so the buyers walked away from the contracts.We got 3 buyers and we didn’t finish the transactions ,because they didn’t want wait so long with not knowing that we can get bank approval for short sale,or people who been approval for the mortgage,didn’t get the mortgage.What is going on? You gave us the way to avoid foreclosure ,but the banks didn’t want to let people finish those short sales.When we start new sales contract (the house prices going down),but the bank wants more money from us to bring on the closing.How this is working, if we have to start selling the house again and again and the price have to be lower ,then before.It is not our fault that the prices going down and we don’t have money(10000-20000) to bring on the closing.It is impossible to DO THIS SHORT SALE!!!!!!It has to be something done,so we really can do it what You gave to us to help us -not the bank!
Do we have to do foreclosure instead of short sale?
PEOPLE NEED YOUR HELP MR. PRESIDENT!!!!!
Sincerely, short sale person from Florida

Dear President Obama,
I am a lifelong Democrat…a seventy-one year old married woman who has pretty much reached her limit. The first vote I cast was for presidential candidate John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and he won, and was a great president that took care of his people. I voted for you, of whom I expect no less.
Following is a little story about my family and reaching limits.
My husband is a very good man. He takes good care of me, respects me and my children, and understands the consequence when I have‘reached my limit’. He is not my first husband.
Spouse #1 was an abusive controller, a bully, a terrorist to his own family. I always knew when he gave me an ultimatum, I should duck or bleed, but‘ducking’just made him more angry and I ended up with a lot of buises and breaks. My children would cry and hide because if they tried to help, he would just laugh at them and then they‘paid’for their efforts. After years of abuse and living in fear for my children and myself, I reached my limit. Herein lies the meat of the story…
Whatever his reason at the time it was…his mistake…I had reached my limit. I stopped his intended assault with an iron skillet. He lived, but not in my house. He is dead now (I had nothing to do with that). There were many assaults before the final one, my children suffered for them as did I. As a divorced mother of three, getting no child support, I took a minimum wage job to feed, house, and clothe my family. It was not an easy way of life but we dealt with it, and survived, and were safe, and learned a lot about‘reaching the limit’.
My second husband and I have been married more than forty years. We’ve had good times and our share of rough spots, but all-in-all we stuck it out with mutual respect, patience, and not challenging one another’s limits.
That brings me to the point of this letter. In my life experience, I have found that:
Bullies don’t compromise,
Ultimatums issued are“duck or bleed”situations,
Terrorists believe only they are right
People that respect you and/or your opinions don’t challenge your limits,
and,
Impatient people make major mistakes.
In other words, bullies are impatient terrorist that issue uncompromising ultimatums and have no respect for others. In my personal opinion the current Republican leaders fit the description to a“T”. American people, like us, are willing fight for and make sacrifices to protect our rights against those who would deny us (like the current Republican leadership).
Please, Mr. President, the people who voted for you have reached their limit. We are tired of ducking, we have shed enough blood, we want to stop paying for the Republican’s mistakes and terrorist tactics. We expect you to quit allowing the Republican leaders to bully you and us, we want you to ignore their uncompromising ultimatums and take a stand in respect for those who put you in the White House. The current Republican leaders selfishly believe in bi-partisanship only if they get everything they want. We know it isn’t going to be easy, but it is time to stop the Republican assault on America, and we will be there for you if you are there for us. Take a stand to show you respect our limits and let the Republican leaders know their“duck or bleed”threats will no longer work because we have all reached our limit.
Respectfully yours

Lets us reflect!
In lite of the the most resent tragedies, once again we as a people are depending on, and looking towards the Government for answers. This is the same Government that people for lack of a better term, has deemed intrusive, overbearing and down right out of control. Oh! what a difference a tragedy makes!! This week the new congress begins it’s operation“revert“. First on their agenda is a feeble attempt to re pill the history making health care legislation, and to stop the progression of the last two years on a whole host of issues , some of which people are just beginning to see affect their lives. There are signs that the financial crisis although stabilized, still remains fragile. The slight decrease in the unemployment rates coupled with the growth of small businesses starting to hire , are all signs that we are headed in the right direction. People are still hurting I see it everyday. I myself wittiness the pain of my family member a vibrate proud woman having to go to the local Health and Human services office for assistance in restoring her electric. Which was disconnected on her 77Th birthday! I might add. If this congress gets its way these programs and many more like them will be among those that will be slated for cuts in an attempt to balance the budget and decrease the deficit, while at the same time giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 3% of Americans disguised as job creating opportunities. I ask you America If these tactics where so effective, then how did we get in the mess to begin with!!? We all know that we need to decrease the deficit, but not at the expense of the poorest of the poor. You can not on the one hand say we must reduce spending, and on the other hand give huge tax breaks to the upper 3% of money earners, which are not paid for but will be past on to us! and expect a decrease in deficit spending. America ! lets hope, no lets demand that this year it is not politics as usual, but that both side will come together as a unit that has been charge to do the bidding for all of Americans not special interest, and not just lip service. America deserves better! I’m just saying.

Dear President Obama, I hope you continue to support education as it is so important. I am 53 years old. At 16 yrs. old I was young and thought I had all the answers, so I decided to quit school. After 35 years of being out of school I decided to go back. I got my GED diploma in 7 months, made student of the year for 2010 and am now in my second semester at college. For the first time in my life I feel that I finally am finishing the rest of my life and I’m making a wrong decision a right one. So please keep on supporting education , it is so important.
Thank You

“We do big things”
America last night I was re energized after hearing the President’s call to arms in regards to making this country what we as a people want the it to be in the age of a new Millennium. We have always been in the forefront of new technology and innovation., and when the odds are against us , that’s when we tend to shine. Imagination and thinking outside of the box has always been the catalyst to new discoveries in science and technology breakthroughs. But we cannot stifle that process by eliminating primary and secondary education funding in an attempt to decrease the deficit. While it is true that spending is through the roof, it was necessary in lite of the state this Country was in. The opposition likes to point to the last two years , as an example when trying to make their point. Needless to say that, but for the vision of this Administration under the leadership of this President, we would not have continual growth in the jobs market, stabilization in the financial markets, continual decrease in the unemployment rates, an increase in building of new homes, closing of the doughnut holes in health care and so on. America!, if the other side really wants to do things that will help decrease the deficit, I say let them start by setting and example such as freezing their own salaries for two years! most of them are well off anyway, and this will show the rest of America that not only must we do and make hard choices but, that they are willing to feel the crunch too . Instead of the people who are already struggling bareing the brunt of the cuts. People wouldn’t mind so much the tightening of the belts if the people who were so willing to give huge Tax breaks to the upper 2% of money earners, somehow got the ca hones to turn that same desire towards themselves first. Why is it every time there needs to be a sacrifice it starts with those who are hurting the most!!? America I am willing to do my part to help get this country where it needs to be, but we as a people need to call upon the House and the Senate to lead by example. They can start by compromising and working together to solve the problems rather than playing politics. As the President said“We do big things”The biggest thing that can be done to show that everybody is on board with reining the deficit is to Freeze their own salaries for two years! at the very least it will show that we are all in this together. I’m just saying!!.

Mr. President:
I heard your state of the union address the other night and I was moved by what you had to say. I was also encouraged when you spoke of the women who is 55 years old and back in school because that is similar to my story. I am a grandmother trying to give back to my community. In 2004 I retired from working with the city&amp;county of San Francisco after 15 years. I injured my back and had to retire early. However, I wasn’t ready to sit down and do nothing so I decided to reinvent myself. I am now back in school on my way to earning a degree in Psychology with emphasis on Substance Abuse. I intend to start a non profit organization call Inspiration by J.A. D.A. (Jesus Against Drug Abuse) once I complete my degree. My goal is to house women who want help with their drug addictions so that they can turn their lives around. I want to assist them with getting their GED and also help them gain entry level job skills and eventually get a permanent address of their own.
Unfortunately in 2007, I reinjured my already aggravated back and was forced to give up my home because I could no longer work and pay my mortgage. I am in the process of reestablishing my credit so that I may fulfill my dream of opening a substance abuse recovery home however, because of my foreclosure and other financial hardships my credit score has declined substantially. I understand that there are many government assistance programs that will help with my down payment of a new home but I can not qualify with my current fico score. My question is this, there are government programs now that will assist people with keeping their homes from going into foreclosure and there are also credit counseling programs out there for the first time buyer but there are no programs to assist a person like myself. Why is that? A lot of hardworking people lost their homes because of one reason or another and now their FICO scores are ruin.
Because I can not reach the fico score needed to qualify for a loan, all of my dreams and goals to give back to my community have to be put on hold, or worst, may never materialize at all. Because of an injury I sustained trying to provide for myself, I must now give up my dream. That does not seem right to me. Is their nothing that can be done to assist people who have lost their home because of circumstances beyond their control? Can the current FICO rules be revised so that the millions of people like myself, who lost their homes through no fault of their own, can possibly restore their credit, so that they may fulfill their dreams?
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, and may God bless you and my God bless the United States of America.
Warm Regards,
Veronica L. Johnson

America What’s More Important!
Let me just start out by saying I own a car , by law I am required to have Insurance on that car before I can get a registration and /or Inspection. It is a requirement in most, if not in every State in this Country. Americans are on board with this, and to my knowledge, their has been no lawsuits, protests, or any backlash too this mandatory requirement. I own a dog, if you are a dog owner and you just happen to own a certain breed of dog , say a Pit bull! you are required by law to have Insurance on that dog. There is however punishments if you are caught driving without the mandatory insurance coverage and if you don’t have the necessary coverage on your Pit bull.. Most States are currently suffering a budget shortfall due to the rising cost of goods and services , payroll, maintenance etc. Hospitals are having to do more with less due to the astronomical increases in operating cost, mainly due to hundreds of thousands of patients throughout the country who when getting sick, have to go through the emergency room, most of them without insurance. The only consequence too this situation is and increase in the cost of the services which is passed on too the America people. The question then becomes why is everything so costly?! America! why is it acceptable to be required to have coverage on a car and a dog, but somehow requiring Humans to have coverage on themselves and their love ones invokes outrage and suddenly becomes unconstitutional!!? Whats wrong with this picture!!? Have we descended into such a uncaring and heartless nation that we put more value in things rather than each other!? All people at some point in their lives will get sick and need to see a health care provider, it is inevitable. I personally feel better knowing that when that situation arises I have coverage for myself and my love ones. There are those who feel that they don’t need are want health insurance, I say!”they don’t until they do”! Some Americans feel that it is not the Governments place to tell them what to do, you have that right, but on that same note, we have the right to not have to suffer the increases in the cost of everything across the board as a result of all of those who’s chooses not to have coverage. I’m just saying!.

Mr. President, let me first commend you on your efforts to quit smoking. I too was a smoker , I started when I was 13 years old, I am now 51. Lord knows that I tried and managed to stop twice once during Marine corp basic, and then again during Navy training, each time I started back. Despite everyone telling me that I needed to stop, it wasn’t until I decided too, and then I ask God to remove that taste out of my mouth and I am proud to say that I have not had a cigarette since. that was almost 4 years ago.I must tell you I don’t miss it at all especially since here in Dallas they cost on average about 7-8 dollars a pack. I did not have any withdrawals or irritability associated with quitting., and I must say that I find the habit offensive now but I am not one of those ex smokers who harp on others too stop. Everybody’s journey is different. I say to you Bravo. In these trying times their must be triggers 24 seven however I’m sure you will handle them with the same tenacity and vigor that you approach the Presidency. God bless you , your family and your administration. and Gog bless the USA. Please always remember and never forget that I and my family are behind you 100%. You make me proud to be an American.

Dear Mr. President Obama,
I am a Father who’s been out of work for the past year, as a Sr. Dimensional Designer, or Mock-Up Artist in Chicago. Being older makes it harder for us to get jobs because of our age. Nevertheless, I am still searching, especially since I have a daughter in Grad School, elementary school, and a 9 month old son. I don’t blame you for the job situation at all, or the lack of employment. I know within your heart of hearts, that you are working on getting this economy back together as best you can, despite all the conflict and rejection your getting from every avenue.
Im praying you and the Government, and hoping you all can eventually come together and bring us back to greatness. I believe, and I stand hopeful even in My demise.
If I may suggest one tiny thing which may help the invironment and put money in the unemployed hands on a daily basis…and i’ve suggested this to others and submitted as a suggestion…BUT, just as we’ve done with cans and scrap metal and obstacle’s, furniture and what have you’s, why don’t we set up dumpsites for recycled garbage bought in from the streets, highways, lots, sidewalks, and where ever, which by the pound or 25lbs bags would net them ONE US DOLLAR. One dollar for every bag of garbage picked up up from the streets of our cities, and highways. Kids, adults, homeless, campers, picnic’ers, fathers, mother’s daughters will start to clean up America and put money in their pockets. This is an unsupervised effort to clean and work and get paid until we either get clean or run out of money. By then we will teach people to hold on to their trash and get paid while disposing it at proper wastesites. Maybe the can recieve food couponds at favorite fast foods, and feed themselve if homeless. Either way, we get clean, we get a little money in our pockets, and creat jobs and not eliminate other workers.
Get back to me. Lets make it work for us.
Thank you

Mr. President, my question to you is why do you refuse to fight back against the Republican Regime. They are taking everything away from the poor and continually giving to the rich.Can we not ask the congress to give up some of their pay and benefits? The upper 2% of our nation hold over forty trillion dollars and yet they never pay their fair share. If you were to propose a law that would require all of the American taxpayers monies to be spent on USA made products, would that not fire up industries in this country. Instead of giving other countries money we have to borrow, give them USA made goods and then the people of those countries would benefit instead of their leadership robbing them blind. We need your help Mr. President and we need you to give the Democratic party and the rest of the middle class and lower income of this country the strength and encouragement to FIGHT BACK. My grandfather used to tell me either lead, follow or get the hell out of the way. What are you going to do? Who can the American people count on to lead us back to prosperity? God bless you Mr. President.

Mr. President, Just a little note to make you aware of what’s going on in my neck of the woods , in hopes that you put a stop to this attack on our children’s education.
What’s wrong with this picture!
America, I just became aware that the (DISD) The Dallas Independent School district is offering teachers up to $10,000 to retire early , like at the end of this school year. Coincidentally this offer comes at the same time that the city is experiencing a budget shortfall. I am perplexed!!! It seems to me that if you are experiencing a money shortage, how then does one come up with the funds to entice teachers to retire, why not use that money to retain them?!! Our children are already lagging behind in Math , and Science, having to do without most extracurricular activities, not to mention being technologically insufficiently educated for today’s job market. I ask you whats wrong with this picture.!!? Kids today are more vulnerable to becoming dropouts because of a lack of innovation and /or interest in whats going on in the classrooms, and now they have to maintain that interest with fewer teacher. All I can say is that if you want a generation that is less likely to surpass the baby boomers educationally speaking”then You DISD are on the right track!“I’m just saying.”Stop the Madness! God bless you, your administration and God bless the United States of America.

dear president obama
i am writing to you cause i need help.we applied for a loan modification and was told we didnt make enough-debt income ratio.thats why we applied in the first place.we are both disabled and work pt when we can find a job.which is going to get harder with gas prices.we are in debt to credit cards 20 thousand, most is interest, not being able to pay more than minimum last few years.we need so much done to house and car but we cant afford that. we need around 5 thousand total for dental work we cant afford to do.periodontal disease. we dont qualify for any help and programs like the tax breaks for buying a house came too late for us. we just cant get a break financially. and of course no social security raises.we have never paid our mortgage late, we pay when checks come in on the third. but we dont have money left at the end of month.we arent living, we are existing. we dont do anything except go to grocery store. we never go to movies, vacations or anything recreational. we cant even go see hubbys mom who lives 90 miles from us and with gas prices going up we will see her less.we just dont know what to do. we want to stay in house and pay what we owe but it just seems everything is getting worst. 2010 was the year from hell, everything that could broke down and we had to pay taxes cause i worked a 1099 job.we are at our wits end, esp with the mortgage situation, the gov bailed them out but i dont see where they are giving back to the consumers, i worked as a telemarketer at a mortgage company for a year and talked to many people who applied for mods but never got them.in a year i only talked to a few who actually got them.i know its not your fault for all these problems but i just dont know where to turn.

I pray for you and the United States and for you decisions and your direction and your family and Michelle EVERYDAY!
Please make an address to the people of the world to pray. God says,“If my people who are called by my name should humble themselves and pray, then shall I hear from heaven and I will heal the land.”He also says,“You have not because you ask not.”He also said,“Ask, and it shall be given unto you.”
Please ask everyone to pray. In your eloquent words, there are many ways inwhich this can be done and I know that you know how. Please get with your religious sector of government and talk with them to find a good way of doing this. A national day of prayer for the world. We need to this now please. God is able and will help us if we ask Him to.

We can do this!
America, watching the Celebrity Apprentice, I saw two groups of celebrities, raise over 1.6 million dollars for charity in just a two hour show. A magnificent feat!. It lead me to this question! suppose we the American people in our own States were to put together a statewide fund raiser to help get the States budget in order! kinda make you go hum! right.?. I know that in my state of Texas we are experiencing a budget shortfall and our Teachers , Public Workers as well as our children’s education are at stake. Teachers are being offered up to $10,000 dollars to retire now. At a time when the unemployment rates has dropped to a promising level, now is not in my opinion the time to add several thousand people too that number. While I don’t mean to equate a charity with the financial woes of our country, I do however see a dire need for change , especially when our children are at risk of falling even further behind in education. I mean think about it! We live in a country that allows Athlete’s, Artist, Actors as well as many other professions to make more money than they could possible spend in two lifetimes, but when it comes to our Teachers, Educators, and our children education, well lets just say it is pathetic. somethings not right! I love the foundations and non-profits that continue to help people all over the world, American is known for that , but it seems to me, that every time there is a need for sacrifices to be made, it starts with the poor working class people first. I’ve said before and I’ll say it again , people wouldn’t mind tightening the belts if it included everybody!!!. A wise man once said”A man can never reach new horizon’s unless he first looses sight of the shores”I don’t know if this fundraiser thing is possible but, I just wanted to put it out there in hopes that some one will organize and /or initiate the process , because our children deserves better! This would save our children, keep our teachers and public workers employed and balance the budget! its a win win ! I’m just saying! Mr President I and my family are behind you 100%.

Mr. President, I appeal to you to stay strong ! your convictions as well as your focus on the matters facing all Americans not just a select few has and will continue to takes us in the right direction. Do Not allow yourself to be bullied into compromising your core beliefs even if it means shutting down the government. Just know that anything worthwhile is worth fighting for, I and my family as well as millions of Americans stand with you and we are willing to go the distance. God bless you ,your family and Administration and God bless the USA.

Dear Mr. President,
During your presidential campaign you have stressed the ideals of “hope” and “change we can believe in.” It is certainly no secret that our country is in need of a change in many areas, most importantly economics, and are domestic and foreign policies. I greatly admire your intense desire to improve the quality of life in this country and I know that the damage to our economy can’t be fixed over night. However, I must admit that I disagree with the way in which you are going about it.
I am in disagreement with your health care reform for many reasons. First of all, the government run health plan will cause many Americans to lose their current insurance. You argue that a public option will increase competition, but if the federal government controls the rules of the private plans, then many private insurance companies will soon be out of business. There is also fear that the government will choose our health care plan for us in order to decrease costs. Also this health care plan will be costly, especially for the richer Americans who will be forced to pay more taxes to help cover the poor.
I am not saying that everyone should not have medical coverage. However, you must allow those who can afford private insurance to still be able to have it. Our great country was built on capitalism and freedom in enterprises, but your health care reform threatens these principles.
I also want to talk about your approach about the future during one of your speeches. You are talking about fast speed trains and more things to make us better in the future. This is a great idea but this is only to help enrich few corporations.
If you really care for the common people, the only way to do it is through investing in construction. Instead of making more trains and feeding few engineering companies and corporations, why not invest in mid income residences in various cities.
This will help small architectural companies, common workers, local providers of services and materials, and help reactivate the economy at the very bottom of the chain instead of from the top down by focusing of feeding overpriced greedy corporations.
Please, Mr. President if you really want to make an immediate impact on this country you should invest in few smaller projects that will generate more jobs impacting more families and small businesses. You should also change the health care reform to where it fits well for are economy.
Thank you for your time and good luck.
Sincerely, Scott Budd.

Mr. President, First let me just say that I and my family are behind you and your Administration 1000% however, it has just come to my attention that in the event of a shutdown ,both the House and Senate will continue to get paid while thousands of Americans receive furloughs!, Sir that hardly seems fair! considering the fact that they are responsible for the shutdown. I am not a happy camper at this point. Is this the policies that govern how things work in Washington, their is something inherently wrong if this is the case. I encourage you to stand strong in your convictions and principle’s, don’t be bullied even if it means a shutdown, just make everyone feel the pain of such an event, EVERYONE!!! I mean its only fair especially sine they are not getting the job done. God bless you , your family , this Administration and God bless the USA.

Dear President Obama:
I admire your intelligence and fairness.
The Corporations are trying to take down America for profit.
Why not fill vacant judge positions in this country with progressives and fire supreme court justices that break the law and replace them with progressives?
Why not bring an end to foreign wars and spend the money here at home?
How about putting people to work on clean energy and U.S. infrastructure? Just some thoughts.

In my opinion this is a non-issue! this feeble attempt to distract from the real problems this administration is facing, are from those who lack the skills and/or knowledge to put fourth there on ideals to solving the financial,economical and Foreign affairs issues this country faces. I say to them this is not a reality show this is real! either get serious about solving real issue are shut up Mr. President, I and my family are behind you 100%. Please always remember and never forget, small minds think small. America knows! stay on course, god bless.

Dear President Obama,
First of all, I’d like to commend you on your bravery! Walking into the mess that has been, and doing your best to clean it up takes a lot of work, time and precise planning. In all the naysayers’defense, I believe they tend to forget that fact.
The reason I write you today is because of my husband of 20 years. He came to the United States at the age of one. He contributes to society, pays his taxes and would die for this country! I am an American Citizen, our children were born in Morristown, NJ, near our hometown, where my husband is living for 40 years now. Our children are attending the same schools their father had. Anyone in our town can tell you what a great man he is.
It is now 6:00 a.m. and I haven’t slept a wink. I arrived at an airport at 9:00 p.m. yesterday to greet my husband, who was returning from a trip from Turkey. I waited several hours before I found out he was being held in customs.
We finally receive his call after 3 a.m. only to find out he doesn’t know when he will be released. Can you imagine the heartbreak the children felt, seeing their dad being treated this way in our country? It tore me apart.
Granted he got into trouble with the law for something petty. How long is one to be punished for a petty crime that was done 21 years ago? How could that be held against him? We all make mistakes when we’re young.
There are all kinds of undeserving people who become American Citizens somehow, yet the most deserving, cannot. It baffles my mind.
Regards to you and your family,
Baffled

Mr President, let me first congratulate you on cracking the face of the Donald! That was brilliant!!, Once again you have set the bar so high that I don’t think any one can touch it. There is no end to your history making feats, and I thought that your inauguration was the proudest moment of my life , until last evening!! my hearth was weeping with a combination of joy, admiration and being a US veteran; a real since of pride. Continue to stand firmly on your principals, and never allow yourself to stoop down to the oppositions level. You make me so proud to be an American , but most of all you make me prouder to be Afro-American. Bravo Mr. President.

Dear Mr. President
Please find the fortitude and courage to do whatever is in your power to support the working class of America. The greatest threat to our democracy is the growing disparity between the wealth of the richest 5% and the rest of us. There are many steps that can be taken but they are strongly opposed by the monied interests out of sheer greed. I know that its difficult and the fear of not being reelected is very real. Sometimes you need to do wwhat is not in your own self interests si ply because it’s the right thing to do. Have the courage of FDR and save our country from the path its heading toward.
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Mr. President,
I am in need of your help. This health care system sucks in the United States. My brother is near death, suffering from heart problems, dietbetes, high blood pressure,arthiritics, Depression, hearing lost, Slur Speech, Unable to stand for long period of time. Can’t follow directions, Unable to make decisions&amp;unable to work. He is currently in the hospital and they are refusing to give him emergency medical or SSI presumption disability. He has been a tax payer for years. I don’t know what more I can do. They are releasing him from the hospital after 5 days of treatment. I can’t work due to the fact that I must take care of him. I was told by Social Worker in order to get the medical or medicare right away, u must be near death. The house we are renting currently, is about to be sold at auction this week. We are in desperate need of your help. I worked on your campaign when you were running for president. So, I’m hoping that you can help me save my brother life.
Sincerely,
Deborah

Mr. President:
I have asked for help getting my partner to the USA from Vietnam for his safety. But The embassy refuses to give him a visa due to fear that he may not return to Vietnam after his visa is over. How ever we can tell the Embassy that he is seeking asylum once here. Others who have asked for refugee status at the Embassy have disappeared and never made it here. That the Embassy staff who conducts the interviews were given all proper documentation and I submitted papers that were approved but since he is poor was turned down. I have ask ti get him an exit visa to the states, but no one with in the government is willing to help an American asking for help to save a life of my chosen life time partner.
Both parties who took oaths ton uphold the Constitution refuse to follow it and discriminate and hold some Americans as second class citizens. I thought Civil right were suppose to be protected by the government not refused. What does it take to get the government to help in a time when a life is at risk. The politicians like speaker of house and McCain waste money on fighting unconstitutional laws, discriminate because there religious views.
I give the Republicans who passes same sex marriage credit. They spoke that there religion had no place in the running of the government and there oath of office did not allow them to prohibit civil rights that are granted to all Americans under the law.
Yet Republicans who said they were out to protect the USA and follow the Constitution are doing everything in there power to not follow it making them liars and should be thrown out of office for committing fraud when taking there oath of office.

Dear President Obama,
My name is Zarine Gazali,22yrs from Mumbai,India. I am writing this mail hoping you would read it one day. I am doin medicine final yr.
I met my perfect guy and am in love with him.He works in NY and had come down to India for his H1visa renewal but due no reason he is being put under administrative processing for which we might have to call the wedding off which is like a huge insult in the society for a girl but even he cant help it and take the responsibility without knowing if he has his residency prog. and his job.
I agree its a matter of national security and hence administrative processing is done but please cant it be done faster so that people dont loose their career for which we struggle so hard and put in our years and end up in misery just because we are muslims and are checked time and again.
Please its a request and i hope the consulates across the world dont take an indefinite time over administrative processing because I just lost on my perfect guy and am still in shock.
Thnakyou Sir.

Mr. President, I appeal to you to stay strong ! your convictions as well as your focus on the matters facing all Americans not just a select few has and will continue to takes us in the right direction. Do Not allow yourself to be bullied into compromising your core beliefs, even if it means letting the chips fall where they may! I live on $1167 dollars a month and part of that is taken before I get my hands on it , to cover things I owe, leaving me with $956 to live on. If I have to make sacrifices so too should the upper 2% of money earners as well as the oil companies. Just know that anything worthwhile is worth fighting for, I and my family as well as millions of Americans stand with you and we are willing to go the distance. God bless you ,your family and Administration and God bless the USA. We believe in you.!

We all know the state this Country is in, both Financially and Economically! and their is enough blame to go around. I don’t really give a flying fish about who’s more or less at fault!, what I and most Americans care about is Fixing it!!. Plain and Simple.!! Now I am not an Economist, nor do I profess to be any kind of expert on these issues, but I am aware of all the Educational Programs, Teacher Layoffs, cuts to Goods and Services that help a large majority of needy people, and other very necessary programs that have been cut or that is on the cutting boards. I am also aware of the massive increase in profit gains that large Cooperation’s as well as big Oil and Gas companies are enjoying; while most Americans are having to tighten their belts. I personally am living on a Fixed income, part of which is garnished for overpayment and other debts, leaving me with what most people would consider very little ! I have lost my home and now reside with my family in the family home! Sound familiar!? Most Americans like myself have not seen an Increase in their income over the past two years, but the cost of everything continue to go up.! So the question remains; Why are the republican base so determined to put the squeeze on 98% of the people in order to continue to give large tax breaks to the upper 2% of money earners and Cooperate Jet owners?!! All of the experts in this matter continue to express a need to have everything on the table, and both sides needs to Stop the Madness! and get the job done!! This is THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, The greatest country in the free world, Not raising the debt ceiling, for any reason is Unsatisfactory, and would weaken and/or completely destroy our standing through out the Political and Financial communities!

Dear Mister President, humanity is at a tragic and extremely fragile junction.
The terrible reality is that people know that almighty Dollar is the universal, all powerful god…they see the conscience of public officials buckle under its lure, they see corruption everywhere, and they know not what to do. We feel powerless.
I pray that you are the man, the hero who dares to remain adamant and uncorruptible no matter the cost. Do not give in. Do what is right at any cost. Uphold justice and equality and history will crown you as the man who dared sacrifice it all for the Amarican pople and the world. May God give you clarity of vision and formidable strength. Thank you for standing straight and lead bravely.

Dear Mr. Obama
I am listening to you this morning on the Debt speech and you are so wrong the American people do not want to know how you all in Washington solve this problem. Eighty percent of the American people do not trust you all in Washington. We do not find the people representing us to be truthful, unselfish, understanding what poor is, and worried about our future. You stated we need to invest in our children an infrastructure. Let’s stop investing
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and make our country strong again, so if someone comes here we can defend our children and our infrastructure. We have all been told all our lives, if you don’t have the money don’t buy. You all need to start listening to your mother and fathers. I am 58 and never had to depend on government program to survive and hope I never do, but I do not live above my means, and so should our country.

This is a wonderful place. Any where you go, it beautiful (Even Oklahoma). Now with that said. I’m truly sad by the fact that“Our Congress”acts like they are all 2 years old. They fight, sometimes they look like they will flip over backwards. Just set a 2 year old in front of you, then look at the Congress. They need to remember they work for us. The people of the United States. Don’t sell us short, PLEASE! Bring jobs back to the United States, stop fighting and work together if you can. I do respect our Congress, I respect you Mr. President. I love these United States. I love our Freedom. Please figure something out.

Dear Mr. President ,
My husband is deployed on the USS Bataan LHD5. Though, I am aware that I signed up to support my husband and his military duties, but not for a deployment that was endless. Since my husbands ship left 3 months early you have yet to set a return date. He has now been gone for over 3 months and it’s harder and harder to go on. On top of the stress of the deployment ,you decided to down size the military and my husband is at risk of being forced out upon his
return. Please stand up, support the military and set a return date !!!!

Please stop the talking and stop the spending,
Is there not enough purity in the hearts of our leadership to make the decisions that are needed to change the‘way things are done in Washington’?
Please stop the spending. Just say no and try some humility.
The system is badly broken and needs some‘integrity’to do the job. I ask myself, are there any real leaders in our leadership.
The way I’m thinking now is I’d rather take a chance of thing‘falling apart’, at least we could then begin to FIX IT.

We are up to the moon with debt, we borrow money only to give it away to other countries, and we rape our own country of our citizen rights….you want to take away from social security putting stress on my elderly parents, you want to take away their medicare benefits…gosh….let’s add more stress to elderly people who had money taken out of their paychecks for decades to support them in their old age..while all of you get paid millions of dollars even after you leave office and sit on you ass writing books…are you kidding me? This country has gone down the toilet….literally….I used to be so proud of this country, but now I am ashamed of all of you represnting the people…if my parents were not still alive, I would move to another country where they respect the elderly and take care of their country before all others….I guess that is the curse of being part of the country who wants to be the SUPERPOWER of the world….who can save us? Only God can….Father, forgive them for they know not what they do…..Amen…

Dear President Obama,
I don;t see how the world can expect the idiots around you to solve the drbt problem they created in the first place. We need new intelligent people to accomplish that.
That is the first task.
Cutting old age benifits isnt the answer, they have paid for what they get, don’t do it.
Saving money can be accomplished by cutting politicians pay and letting them build their own 401k’s and paying for their own medical plan like everyone else.
Hope this helps,
And Oh ! by the way please end all the wars, that should save a lot also.

The republican part created this crisis, holding our financial and economical solvency hostage for their own sjenda, Most Constitutional legal scholars has come to the conclusion that this violates the very constution they claim to hold so dear! I say! if that is the case then You can now as a matter of national security envoke your right as the President and use the 14th amendment to put an end to this fisaco! As it stands we are becoming a laughing stock around the world and it just weakings our Standing across the board! Sir, this is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, the gratest contry in the free world, and we don’t default on our obligations to our citizens, our military and our or debtors! So Please Mr. President if they insist on being children then I and millions of Americans stand with me on this , you must put a stop to this madness ! by envoking the use of the 14th amendment! God bless you and God bless the United States of America!

President Obama,
How could you do something so heartless as to put Social Security on the table. Millions of people depend on that money…money that they earned. Its wrong to take that money. Its stealing from the American people. Take money from Congress. They should not continue to receive a paycheck after they have left office. How much is spent on that? I think we need to clean house in all our government and start over. I voted for you Obama but I am beginning to regret that. You dont show any gumption at all. This country is disappointed in you!!!

Dear President Obama-
I am glad you will be enjoying vacation with your family, but this is not good timing. Please cut it short, come back and talk specifics about jobs! I live in Bucks County, PA in Mike Fitzpatrick’s district. I am self employed. My hubby has worked hard all his life, he was laid off twice and thankfully is working now. I am 64 and my husband is 62, I do thank you for extending unemployment benefits and COBRA as it saved us! We both fought for you-we still will-and please be forceful, do the right thing, support us, your base–and talk what exactly you are doing about JOBS where, when, etc.??? Thank you. Mary T

Dear President Obama:
You are in my prayers every day. Please be the leader we know you can be in your own quiet way (like the way you enabled our brave men to get Bin Laden). We know, in the same way, you will get this country back to a better place. I hope that you will lead us away from the Middle East–bring our men and women home. I am frightened of the Tea Party.
They don’t want the country to go anywhere while you are in office. They want you to fail-you can’t compromise with these people. Best wishes to your wonderful family. PS Bucks County PA needs better roads and bridges-can you push Mike Fitzpatrick a little and put some people back to work in Bucks County! Mary Tessell

Dear President Obama–you need to reach out to the black community or they won’t vote at all! Unemployment is 20% in some areas of the cities for African Americans! Come on, President Obama put these poor people to work! Not that it’s your fault–I am addressing this to both congressional D’s and R’s.
PLEASE HELP! MARY

Dear President Obama -
It’s me again, Mary. I am a pest, I know, but I so much want you to succeed!
Not a good time to be on vaca; I know you deserve it, but many people, both R’s and D’s are not happy about the timing and I am discouraged that your approval rating is at a new low of 26%. I hope you have a good jobs plan, in writing, when you return and you must not yield to Congress.

Dear President Obama,
Yes we can….. I believe in you…. you’ll do the right thing for all of us, who have been your camp from the beginning. You have done a lot-people don’t realize how much–because of the obstructionists–people just don’t get it. I think you did the right thing re Libya-but once again- jobs, jobs, jobs!
I pray for you every day, President Obama. I really do hope you and your family are having a good vacation.

Dear President Obama,
Thank you for paying attention to all of us who are in the path of Hurricane Irene. I know you are in touch with FEMA all the time, and I know that you will do all that you can do provide us with the necessary assistance that we will need. Not only am I sure you will help keep us safe–you will for sure be able to create many jobs for people!
Thank you!
Mary T

I am in a state that by majority does not like you. I however am one who sees a different side. You have managed to irritate the right and the left so I can only by deductive reasoning believe you represent me, average“shmuck”American. I am behind you all the way keep shooting that left handed jump shot all the way to a win in 2012, the economy will improve and we will be able to tackle the many issues of the our day.—Born again Christian

Hello mr president. I have a question you may have no answer for. The home In detroit I lived in was damaged by fire 1/12/11. We are insured by Allstate and have not got any help in the form of living expenses or recovery of clothing an valuables is there any way to expedite the process so we can get back to a normal way of life. Much love to you an yours.

The American economy drags its feet, like a reluctant child on his way to school. Anyone at economics 101 level knows that any economy, personal, family, company or national will not work unless those directly affected feel confident. Whilst millions of American families remain under water, financing a debt not of their own creation there will be no confidence and no recovery. Bernanke, Obama, whoever; need to urgently address this issue or leave the national economy to fester for years to come. Americans are diligent and industrious and when necessary imaginative. Having had to endure the shameful spectacle of witnessing billions of dollars of public money, poured into the coffers of those financial institutions, gamekeepers turned poachers, who were the shameless architects of the current malaise, millions of decent families have indisputably been left; hung out to dry. It would not need a genius to craft the necessary legislation to allow (force) the lenders, with assistance from the IRS to become imaginative regarding restructuring these mortgages which are keeping the brake on all the attempts the government might make to ‘kick start’ economic activity.
Someone must turn the light at the end of the tunnel on again.

Dear Mr. President,
I personally invite you to come to boise, idaho and see the beautiful town. I would personally show you how beautiful this state and town is. I am a 31yr old unemployed man that is struggling. I have a beautiful 3yr old little girl and even though I am struggling to find a job after I was let go a year ago and working for the company for 11yrs I still maintain a positive attitude. My unemployment is running out in a couple of months and I have alot of resumes and applications in, but either I am over qualified or they already filled the position. I wish and wish that the airforce one would land here and I would greet you and be able to spend the day with you and sit down and talk and show you how beautiful this town really is!! As long as I have been alive I think one president has been to this state and I really dont think people really know how beautiful this town is and how great the people are!! I can only dream that in my lifetime I will every meet the strongest president we have had. I would love to sit and talk about things that I think would be great with the country and but I would also like to just know you. I know I would also for you to love to meet my daughter. She would be really excited to meet you. Well have a great day and I really hope that you read this.

Dear Mr. President,im a 55 year old woman looking for your help in some issuses that i would like to talk to you about if i may.I would like to see you have more housing for the elderly and take away housing and projects,that some people abuse it.I want to know why you dont go after the musicians and movie stars instead of the poor people.You also said that you take the Marines and and the rest of them out of the war in 2011.The people that get medicare,i dont think it is right that you would even go there.There are people that social security and the republicans are trying to take that away also,which is not fair to the people of our country.I am one of those people that have disabilites.So please Mr.President can you consider what am asking you to do?We lose another cost of living raise because our country is so messed up?Which i dont think is very fair to us at all,can you see what imtalking about

Dear Mr.President,can you plese help us out?We need new jobs and there are alot people out work.There are alot of people that are on housing and living in projects,when it should be just for the elderly only 65 years old and up?Please get our troops out of the war as well.Would you consider discussing with the movie stars and musicians to try and tax them as well?You could save billions of dollars if you could check into each state about the people that are on housing an try and fix that problem and keep it for the elderly like i said?We dont even get our cost of living raise any more which is not fair to us people that get social security? So if you can consider what im talking about it would gretly appreciated,thank you for listening?

Dear Mr. President,
I have trouble reading small print, but I would like to say something, hopefully it is posted.
As you know the United States was established with rights for the people. One being the right to wordship the way a person wishes to. That is stated in the on our currency.
Those few people who want to take God out of people lives, have no right. Even thou they state that they do not believe in anything, they do. All people believe in something, even if only them self. That is part of being human. People believe in God, no matter what they might call him. The basic is that the larger amount of the people believe in One God. That he send down his only son and that is why we call Christmas, Christmas, for if you take Christ out of Christmas you have a mas, or a mess. He is the the who told us that it is better to give then receive.
I myself say“Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year”I also tell people”don’t to drink too much Sparketly Cider on New Year Eve”
For the greater amount of people, who believe in God and like you, PLEASE stop saying“Happy Holidays”and Start saying“Merry Christmas”. Never mine those few who say they do not believe in God. For you say that you are a Christian, now is the time to show it and prove the rest of the people who say that you are not, that you are.
Just put any of the non-believers in a fox hold in the battle field and see how fast they change their minds.
May the Great Father in Heaven guild you and yours and also keep you safe in the palm of his hand, safe and healthly.

I am so sick of the American people complaining about what president obama is doing for this country. HE’S TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEMS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MADE FOR AMERICA. UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH JR. AMERICA FOUGHT TWO WARS WE DID NOT HAVE TO FIGHT, WASTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS. IF YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN–COMPLAIN ABOUT GEORGE BUSH JR. AND HOW HE SINGLE HANDLY ALMOST DESTROYED THIS COUNTRY, GOING OVERSEAS TO FIGHT A FIGHT THAT WAS NOT OURS IN THE FIRST PLACE. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ONLY TRYING FIX SOME OF THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO OUR COUNTRY. THE OLD RACIST REPUBLICANS DON’T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MINORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY, AS LONG AS THEY CAN FILL THEIR POCKETS WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS…AGAIN TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON BUSH AND NOT ON PRESIDENT OBAMA.
