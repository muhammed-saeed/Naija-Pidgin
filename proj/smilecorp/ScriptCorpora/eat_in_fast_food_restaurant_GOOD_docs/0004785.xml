 Restaurant Diet Facts 
 Aug 7, 2010 | By Maria Scinto Photo Credit close up plate of food image by Joseph Pierce from Fotolia.com 
If you enjoy eating out, it can be tough to stick to your diet resolutions. You may find yourself tempted to just throw caution to the winds and splurge---and if you&apos;re dining at a four-star restaurant to celebrate your birthday, go right ahead. If, however, you&apos;re in the habit of dining out on a regular basis, there are a few sensible precautions you can take to make sure that every bite you eat doesn&apos;t go to &quot;waist.&quot;
 
Posted Nutrition Information

The health care bill passed in 2010 had a requirement that all chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets nationwide must post calorie counts for all menu items in their establishments, both on their printed menus and on menu signboards and drive-through signs. This regulation, which is already in effect in New York City, is expected to be in place nationwide by 2011. This should allow you to make healthier choices, as you can see immediately that, for example, a Wendy&apos;s Junior Bacon Cheeseburger has 370 calories, while a Baconator triple has1,360 calories.
 
Diet-Friendly Restaurants

Seafood restaurants can be a good choice, as long as you avoid fried items or buttery seafood casseroles. Mediterranean restaurants tend to offer a number of healthy options: lean meats cooked in olive oil, wine and lemon juice instead of butter and cream, for example. Tapas restaurants offer you the chance to select a few small portions of several items rather than one oversized entree. Many chain restaurants offer special diet menus, and you can often read up on the nutritional information on their websites before you go, so you can pre-select your diet-friendly order. If you are on the low-carb diet, try a steak house, but be sure to skip the baked potato.
 
Best Foods to Choose

If you&apos;re not low-carbing it, pasta can be an acceptable diet choice, particularly if you choose a marinara sauce. A moderate portion of spaghetti with marinara sauce is just 260 calories as opposed to a similar portion with Bolognese (meat) sauce, which will cost you about 390 calories. If you enjoy Japanese food, sashimi is an excellent low-calorie, low-fat choice, with most types ranging between 20 and 40 calories per ounce. Sushi is a bit more fattening (and carb-heavy), particularly the rolls, which range from around 150 calories apiece to nearly 400 calories for the unagi (eel) and avocado roll. Grilled chicken and fish are always diet-friendly, particularly if they are well-seasoned with spices and/or citrus marinades as opposed to being dressed with cornstarch-thickened or sweet sauces.
 
Portable Calorie Counter

If you have an iPhone, Droid, Blackberry or other similar device, you can easily download an app that will allow you to track your calories on the fly. One particularly popular app is Livestrong&apos;s own Calorie Tracker, which allows owners of iPhones, iPod touches, and iPads to access nutritional data on over 625,000 different foods. Not only does this app allow you to monitor your daily intake of calories, carbs, protein and fat, but it also allows you to calculate the number of calories you&apos;ve burned by engaging in exercise or other daily activities such as doing laundry or washing dishes.
 
Leftovers

Before you order, take into consideration whether your entree lends itself well to leftovers. If you&apos;ve ordered a large steak, you can easily cut it in half and ask for a takeout container to bring home the rest of it for tomorrow&apos;s sandwiches, thus saving yourself fully 50 percent of the calories as well as providing yourself with a free lunch. Leftover pasta, on the other hand, can get a bit messy and hard to deal with. And salad, while usually thought of as the dieter&apos;s best friend, does not lend itself well at all to leftovers. According to &quot;The Takeout Cookbook,&quot; mayonnaise-based salad items such as tuna, potato or macaroni, can be refrigerated for up to five days; but lettuce-based salads wilt within hours.
