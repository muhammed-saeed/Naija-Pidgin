My Writing Prompts

I&apos;ve decided that I&apos;m going to start putting daily writing prompts up on my website. I&apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time and since it&apos;s almost the first of the month, I decided to start with February 2010.

There are two prompts for each day. There is a single word prompt and there is a longer exercise. They are not necessarily related, but they might be on certain days, like Valentine&apos;s Day. Feel free to use these exercises and get writing! You can do 1 minute, 5 minute, 10 minute, or 20 minute writing exercises.

And if you happen to write something publishable, drop me an email to tell me and if appropriate, give me credit for the writing prompt. Nothing formal, just a shout out.
