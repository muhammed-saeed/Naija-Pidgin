I am interested in starting my career with Veolia Environmental Services. The position I would like to apply for is a mechanic. I do have some mechanic background that should help me get the job. Does anyone think I should provide reference letters from old clients to better my chances of getting the job?


 
 Q.broussard: 





Sure,experience is a plus

Absoutley!!!!! Have you ever filled out an app. before? The info the company, or any company, cares about is what your past work ethics and accomplishments. These things tell H.R. what they need to know to make a good decision. You HAVE TO PUT REFERENCES or they won’t know who to believe.
