 MARATHON COUNTY (WAOW) -- A Christian group is predicting the end of the world in nine days.

Billboards across the country are advertising this including one in Marathon County. The billboard outside Hatley says judgment day is coming May 21.

The billboard&apos;s sponsor, Family Radio, says the Bible proves this. According to its website, Family Radio uses a formula to predict the day the world will end. The formula states that day will come 7,000 years after the flood in the days of Noah, which the group claims is May 21, 2011.

Family Radio&apos;s website urges people to pray to be among the few that are saved before the world is destroyed.

Newsline 9 asked people along Highway 29 in Marathon County what they think.

&quot;They claim a lot of times that the world&apos;s gonna end but it never seems to,&quot; said John Blaschka. &quot;I really don&apos;t get too worried about it.&quot;

&quot;The billboards, they&apos;re there,&quot; said Dee Duckett. &quot;But as far as the message, if the world ends, it&apos;s going to happen and there&apos;s nothing we can do about it.&quot;

Family Radio is based in California, but the group&apos;s website says its programs are broadcast around the world.
