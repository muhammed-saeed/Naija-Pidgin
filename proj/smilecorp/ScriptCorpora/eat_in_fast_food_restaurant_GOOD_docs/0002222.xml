The‘Smack Attack: The Charlotte Bobcats’Bismack Biyombo - Fan’s Analysis
 
By Andrew Sweat , Yahoo! Contributor Network Mar 7, 12:13 am EST 
 
The 2012 Charlotte Bobcats are horrible. Terrible. Putrid.



If the Bobcats were a movie, they would be Troll 2 . If they were a fast food restaurant, they would be Jack in the Box . If Charlotte&apos;s&quot;professional&quot;basketball team was a car, it would be a Ford Pinto . Entering tonight&apos;s game against the Orlando Magic the Bobcats had played 35 games this season and had notched approximately four more NBA victories than a six-pack of New Coke.

But then something magical happened tonight as the Bobcats faced off against Dwight Howard and the Magic. Amid the choruses of&quot;Boo&apos;s&quot;and&quot;Zzzzzzzzz&apos;s&quot;generally emanating from Time Warner Cable Arena, a beautiful sound emerged this evening. The sound was this:



SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!



The sound was courtesy of the Bobcats 19-year-old rookie Center Bismack Biyombo rejecting seven Magic field goal attempts and playing solid defense in holding Dwight Howard to 15 points on 6-13 shooting.



Then a new sound emerged from the crowd. Could that be cheering? In Charlotte? Seriously?



Apparently those are the sounds that accompany a home victory against a playoff-bound opponent, which is exactly what the Bobcats delivered tonight against Orlando. It was Charlotte&apos;s first home win since defeating the lowly Golden State Warriors on January 14th, nearly two months ago.



Propelling the Bobcats to the upset victory was Bismack Biyombo, who contributed 10 points, 15 rebounds, and smacked away the seven aforementioned Magic shots.



 The Magic 29-Minute Mark

 When Bismack Biyombo gets minutes, the young post player produces.



Including tonight&apos;s game against Orlando, Biyombo has played at least 29 minutes five times so far this season (vs. ORL, IND, TOR, CHI, and PHO) and his numbers in these five games have been outstanding - 9.2 points on 63% FG (17 of 27), 12.0 rebounds, and an astounding 4.7 blocks per game.



More importantly, the Bobcats are 2-3 when Bismack Biyombo plays at least 29 minutes. In the games in which Biyombo has played less than 29 minutes, the Bobcats are cover-your-eyes awful 3-28.



 Flashes of Brilliance 

But even as a raw, developing rookie, Bismack Biyombo showed flashes early in the season of the type of player he could become with more minutes. On January 13th he swatted five shots in just 12 minutes against the Detroit Pistons . On January 17th, once again facing the Orlando Magic, Biyombo played a then season high 21 minutes and delivered his first career double-double, posting 11 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks. Five nights later, Biyombo dropped 11 points, 7 rebounds, and four more blocks in just 18 minutes against the New Jersey Nets .



With the season already a disaster, the Bobcats made a rare smart move and inserted Bismack Biyombo into the starting lineup on February 4th. In 10 full games as a starter (excluding the Feb 29th game when he played only nine minutes due to injury), Bismack Biyombo has averaged a solid 6.3 points on 52.2% shooting (23 of 44), 8.7 rebounds, and 2.8 blocks per game.



The 2.8 BPG is significant as it would put Biyombo second in the league behind Oklahoma City&apos;s Serge Ibaka and his league-leading 3.2 BPG average.



It is not difficult to imagine Bismack Biyombo developing in time into a Ben Wallace -type force in the paint, consistently delivering double-digit rebounding performances while leading the league in blocked shots. And if Bismack Biyombo becomes a key piece in the Bobcats&apos;rebuilding process and helps turn this terrible team into a winner in the near future, the weary Charlotte faithful would only have one thing to say:



&quot;Holy smack!&quot;
