Pizza Hut

 Hauptstraße 111 69117 Heidelberg 

Pizza Hut.  Arguably one of the most popular fast food restaurant chains in the United States.  But how does the tomato sauce compare in another country?  Does the pizza taste better as you get closer to Italy – the birthplace of pizza?  What about the preparation of chicken wings in Germany?  Anything unusual about Pizza Hut in Deutschland?

 

Walk inside this Pizza Hut for the first time and you might feel a bit lost.  There are no cash registers to walk up to, no service counters to wait in line for.  It might take a moment for you to realize that Pizza Hut here is not your quintessential fast food joint like in the States, but rather an actual sit-down and order restaurant.  One glance inside and you will surely be amazed at how elegant the restaurant looks.  The dining area is so upscale and trendy – almost enough to qualify as fine-dining.  There are plenty of tables–dark brown polished wooden tables–here, enough to accommodate large parties and families.  Silverware awaits you at your table.  There is even an open service counter window through which diners can see the kitchen staff at work.  This alone definitely makes dining here an exciting experience.

The menu at this Pizza Hut is, unexpectedly, rather extensive.  There are a large number of appetizers, including country potatoes, crispy mushrooms, quesadillas, chicken sticks, and chicken wings.  In addition to your typical types of pasta, lasagna and gratins are also offered.  What makes Pizza Hut here unique is the variety of desserts listed on the menu.  Not only can you order hot pancakes and Belgian waffles here, but also donuts, Panna Cotta, and ice cream.  Wine and beer are also served up.

 

Order the 2,90 € chicken wings and you get 6 hot pieces – 3 drummettes and 3 wings – a choice of dipping sauce (Sour Cream, Barbecue, Guacamole, Ketchup, or Mayo), and a towelette.  Forget to mention your desired dip and you will get BBQ – which is a bit smoky and sweet.  Nothing spectacular about the presentation of the dish, but that’s expected.  The chicken wings are seasoned well and taste perfectly fine without any sauce.  Think miniature rotisserie chicken wings.  Of course, add on the sauce and the flavor changes drastically.  Unfortunately, Pizza Hut in Germany does not offer Buffalo styled wings so you will surely be disappointed if you want something spicy.

The pizzas at a German Pizza Hut are similar to the pies back home.  Naturally, a wide variety of toppings are available, in addition to a select number of crusts (pan pizza, New York style, and stuffed crust).

 

Ask for a Margherita pan pizza and you will essentially get a cheese pizza.  The mozzarella cheese is bubbly, gooey, and delicious; the pizza is cooked fresh and served steaming hot in a pizza tray.  The texture of the dough is nice and fluffy–delicate and delectable.  Crust is crisp.  Surprisingly, the tomato sauce in Germany has the same taste as in the US.  A normal sized pizza is approximately 23 cm, a bit larger than a personal pan pizza.  At 4,50 € it is a reasonably priced pie that can easily be shared by two people.

Pizza Hut will easily satisfy your cravings for something simple, familiar, and delicious.  Stop by for the food and sit down for an amazingly pleasant dining experience.
