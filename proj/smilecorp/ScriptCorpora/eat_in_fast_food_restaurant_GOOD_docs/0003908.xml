I love the moonies burger. Some people describe it as greasy. But there are two things you need to consider. 1) Its a hamburger, fat = taste. 2) They use hawaiian bread which is inherently sweet.

Anyways, the mushroom swiss is the winner for me. With nice crispy fries. mmmm

All the burgers are good, and then at the Anderson Mill/Research location you have the option of blue bell milk shakes. Don&apos;t go here looking for healthy meals, although the chicken sandwiches always looked good. I am confident it is my favorite in the area.

I decided to give *this* Moonie&apos;s location a chance, since I&apos;ve written off the Cedar Park and Pflugerville locations. See my older reviews.

That turned out to be a complete waste of time, unfortunately.

I wanted to be proven wrong... I wanted to be impressed... I wanted to like it.

I wasn&apos;t wrong... I wasn&apos;t impressed... I didn&apos;t like it.

The place is a mess. It&apos;s dirty. It&apos;s dumpy. The food took FOREVER and it was &apos;average&apos; flavor. Nothing spectacular, and not worth $12 for a burger, drink and rings.

Sorry, Moonie&apos;s, that&apos;s three strikes for you... you&apos;re out.

 Moonie&apos;s Burger House 6/23/2012    «Hide Hey Ron...Thanks for giving us a try. It sounds as though… More» Hey Ron...Thanks for giving us a try. It sounds as though you just dont like our place or our food. Some people don&apos;t and others love it. As you know everything is made to order so it will take 8-10 minutes best case scenario to complete an order. When we are packed as we often are it will take 10-15 minutes. Most people understand when its busy it may take a little longer and most are willing to wait a little longer because we do put out a great product. Sounds as though it does not fit the flavors you like but we sure appreciate you giving us a try. Our pricing is the least expensive of any place around including mighty fine, five guys, fuddruckers, Red Robin etc..we are $8.99 for any burger you want, fries and a bottomless soda. I wish we could please 100% of the people out there (we sure try) but its just impossible. It sounds like you are one of those and I really am sorry. As I stated earlier We really appreciate you giving us a shot and we will miss your business. I hope you have a great day. Flag this comment

I LOVE their fries here. LOVE. Also, they have that crunchy ice here, which I&apos;m strangely fixated on. (Like Sonic&apos;s ice..)

However, everything else was okay. My burger was fine, but the bun was essentially an oversized Hawaiian roll which was too sweet for me. Meat was kind of gritty, nothing special.

It&apos;s an alright little place. Folks were friendly enough, atmosphere was alright. I might try it again.

Burgers here are great in my opinion.  fries as well.  Often times the drink machine is neglected.  They lose points there.  Maybe they need it behind the counter so they dont forget about it.  If you see a lady working the register that looks in her late 40&apos;s or so be prepard.  She is a bit off and can come off as rude.  I think they should put her somewhere else.  Bad body language and poor attitude.  She might be the owner.  i have no idea.  She does not even ask you anything.  She jsut stands there and gawks at you lol.  Most people would say something like, &quot;How can I help you?&quot;, not her lol.  I think she thinks if she does not say anything you amy leave and then she will nothave to work.

I&apos;m not sure why Moonie&apos;s gets such a bad rap. I know they have yet to learn that teenagers make for terrible employees but have one very important thing going for them...
They are consistent. Not a lot of places do that these days. They keep their menu simple and every time I order my &quot;go to&quot; burger it&apos;s always the same. That why I go back to Moonie&apos;s.

When they opened their first location in CP I was there the first week it opened. They are still cranking out the same tasty burgers as they did then. You gotta respect that.
Moral of the story, If you can brave the cheesy country music and put up with the teenagers (cause really who else is going to work at a burger joint?) then it&apos;s a good meal for a fair price.

BEST hamburger and fries in town.

WORST MILKSHAKE IN TOWN at the Anderson Mill location..  It was So thin it was just ice cream flavored milk.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN TOWN. On Father&apos;s Day, When I complained about the ultra-thin milkshake, the manager said, &quot;What did you say?&quot; In amazement, she looked over to who was making the shakes, NEVER apologized or offered an explanation or compensation, and continued on her task at the cash register. So I walked away, never to return to that store.

My favorite, especially the Swiss Mushroom burger. The fires are excellent and I am not a potato eating person. I particularly like the slightly sweet bun. Prefer over Mighty Fine. Limited menu and the only time I tried the grilled chicken salad I was sadly left unsatisfied. Should have stuck to the burgers in a burger house. Not much atmosphere and the ice machine seems to regularly run out of ice but a must for burger lovers.

This place started out being judged harshly as it was choice #3 for my husband&apos;s birthday lunch (he wanted Red Robin - I know - but whatevs, and they closed.  Then, second was Hoovers, who also closed, this ended up being a...well, it&apos;s right here).

+1 star for having the exact meals we wanted to order (a plain chicken sandwich and a Hawaiian burger - which actually seems to be pretty rare around here lately).
+1 for reminding us of a hole in the wall type burger joint we frequented in San Diego.
+1 for delicious fries and REALLY delicious rings
+1 for the totally awesome doughy bread the sammiches came on.

I am disgustingly, yet happily, fat and tired after my first trip to Moonies.  I&apos;ll return (but know to only get one side for 2 people, not 3 sides for 2 people) for sure.

Their burgers and fries (crispy and sweet potato!) are quite good.

It&apos;s in my neighborhood and I have been here many times, eat in and carry out.

Their service is bad or perfectly satisfactory depending upon luck, I suppose.  I&apos;ve come many times and have been satisfied with the service.
Other times I&apos;ve had our order lost on a very slow day and waited forever, without even an apology from the waiter.  At my request they did get my young child some fries to eat while we waited.  It did seem they weren&apos;t real thrilled to do so, though.
I&apos;ve also been told to stand in a line 15+ customers long to pay for my to-go order?!  Why even bother with calling in the order if I have to wait to pay while my food gets cold.  They have no sings for a to-go line either, which would be useful since the line can be long at times.

I&apos;m usually rather patient and understanding, and at times their service bothers even me.

I continue to return from time to time as the food is definitely good, and it&apos;s location is convenient for me. I will say we&apos;d likely come more often if the service was better and the prices a little cheaper.

Certainly worth checking out for the burger and fries.

Decent counter-service burger joint.  I tried the bacon cheeseburger with some fries and the hamburger bun was really fantastic, it had a great sweetness to it. The burger itself was extremely greasy - not that greasiness that comes off some really good meat but that fast food greasy that makes you feel like you&apos;re at risk of catching on fire if you go near an open flame.

I&apos;ve been to Moonie&apos;s 5 or so times, and I&apos;ve never had any of these &apos;horrible customer service&apos; run-ins that I&apos;m seeing on here. Of course, I&apos;m friends/acquaintances with most of the employees because I went to high school down the road. The burgers are some of the best I&apos;ve ever had- the bun is crisp, buttery, and has a kick of sweet in it. Awesome! The shakes are also incredible, made with real Blue Bell. Not a fry eater, so I can&apos;t vouch for those, but the rest of the food is incredible!

Customers like you are what makes this a fun business to be in. You love our food and our space. i am sorry the place was not up to par on cleanliness. I can tell you we had a big problem with the finish on all of our large tables- they always felt extremly sticky thus also felt dirty. I heard this from a few people and have since gone in and sanded down all of the large tables and re-finished them myself. They are much better as of 10 ten days ago. Thank you for letting me know. I also have talked to the team about keeping the restrooms picked up etc. through out the day.  We really appreciate your business and thanks so much for your feed back. Hope to see you soon.

Based on Brian G.&apos;s (the owner of Moonie&apos;s) response to my review, I feel inclined to take back my comment about them being racists. At least he&apos;s trying and that counts for a lot. I was hoping this could have been the &quot;go to&quot; burger joint for me and my coworkers that frequently go out to lunch in the Anderson Mill and Research area. But it&apos;s so hard to undo a first impression. I might try another location some time in the future.

Please dont be so quick giving judgement in a public forum without even talking to one of our employees.

This felt like one of those places that was opened by someone who thought the restaurant industry is a great way to make a quick buck.

Food was not good. Service was worse, and slow. In hindsight, I wish she hadn&apos;t realized she forgot the fries. They were bargain basement fare that I doubt Sysco even carries.

There are way too many average-to-good-to-great burger joints in Austin to waste your time and hard earned money here.

Sounds like its just not the place for you. Our fries are some of the best out there and have won many awards and accolades - again probably just not for you. Upon opening our restuarant five years ago we of course were hoping to make a quick buck(dreaming of course) but as anyone in the business knows it is a 12 hour a day work week while being on call the other 12. To help clarify Since its sounds as though you do not understand the business- there are not a lot of quick bucks in the restuarant business. Again i am sorry your visit to us did not meet your expectations. We work extremely hard to provide great food to all our loyal customers. Flag this comment

anderson mill location... ordered 2 burgers for take out... waited 20+ minutes... watched as the employees got other orders mixed up... customers coming up with incorrect orders... unbelievable... looks like the entire process is using hand scribbled orders that are placed in or by the food baskets... too easy to get mixed up or lost... i think they gave my to go order to the wrong person because i swear i saw the guy bring the order back into the store... then the waitress finally found me and i swear i saw bite marks in my burger... i ate it... it was good.. just not fresh.
.
UPDATE: got a response from the owner - he was very sincere - i actually felt bad about writing such a negative review - but it was all true - i thought the restaurant should of apologized and cooked me a fresh one - but i am going back (free burger) !!

Well Mr. Moonie I was hoping for better, much better.

Tip number 1.   A little bit of music after 9. Or, do you never have music?

Tip number 2.   Employees that aren&apos;t pissed off that customers are entering at 9 on a Saturday when you close at 930 (on a Saturday,  Really?)

Tip number 3. Please let us have some ice for our drinks.

Tip number 4. When someone says order up and a server (?)  doesn&apos;t hear it.  WHY don&apos;t you just tell us when our order is ready?

Tip number 5. We know when you are young you want to leave ASAP on a weekend night but don&apos;t take it out on the customers who are wondering why the hell you are closing at 930pm anyway.

Tip number 6. Your Employees do not seem to enjoy their job so I guess that is why the help wanted sign was on the door. And they were texting.   I asked the cute dude if there was a manager there he said, &quot;No the manager, owners and assistant manager are not here.&quot; Early Easter I suppose?

Tip number lucky 7.  wth do you have 8 employees when half of them are texting or chatting with the one and only burger guy or bitching about customers coming in so late.   Why 2 stars?  your burgers are good, your beer prices are right but your employees appear to want to be on a reality tv show.      Oh, and I really wanted to take the keys out of the door as I left since I was locked in and there was no one there to let me out.  Now that is great customer service for ya.  Not one smiling face in the place.  Except for the dude that was hoping for Memphis to win against the Spurs.

Oh, and how about some hats on the burger dude and dudes that hang around him chatting.

Best part of the evening?  it really felt like I was in some kind of reality show where how many people under the age of 23 could be so lame and to care less about their jobs.  8 people in a burger place and 5 of them were doing NOTHING.

Come ON!

I am on a rant b/c when I worked at an independent burger joint millions of years ago it was one cashier, one cook and one manager after 7 until midnight.

DREADFUL customer service. I just attempted to call in an order for pick up and when I was on the phone with the woman, I asked my boyfriend one thing and asked to her to wait a second and she hung up on me. I called back and asked to speak to the manager and she claimed to be the manager so I asked why she felt the need to hang up on a customer and she then said she didn&apos;t hang up, she lost connection, which is total bs I heard the b$@#! hang up the phone, so I then said thanks but no thanks and hung up myself. I understand if someone is perturbed that I had to ask my boyfriend a question about his order, but the whole hanging up thing happened in a matter of seconds, it wasn&apos;t like I was taking two minutes or something. Not to mention you NEVER hang up on a customer. Total bs.

We have now been to Moonie&apos;s several times.  Once at the Cedar Park location, the rest at the Anderson Mill location.  We have all ordered a variety of their burgers and have all enjoyed our burger and fries very much.  The milkshakes are very thick and tasty, as well. They have a lot of teens working there, but we have always gotten fine service. I like that they have bottled beer there if we want to order one.  I also like that my kid gets a snow cone with his kid&apos;s meal.  I also like that we are all full after a meal.  (Did I mention I have teens?)

The fries are always hot and crispy.  The burgers are very tasty.  This last time my husband and I both ordered the buffalo burger and we were both very surprised (in a good way!) with the amount of blue cheese on the burger.

So, yeah, we will be going back.  Lots of good burger places in Austin, and this will definitely be in the rotation.

Just tried out Moonie&apos;s today and I really liked it!

I got to say, it&apos;s not a gourmet burger palace like Hop Doddy&apos;s and they won&apos;t serve your burger to temperature but that being said, it&apos;s a great restaurant if you&apos;re in the market for a tasty burger, good crispy fries, and a filling experience.

It&apos;s a burger house so you have to assume that the presence of many loud and screaming children is likely...unfortunately. But you&apos;re not exactly here for the ambiance either.

It&apos;s a nice thick meat patty that&apos;s cooked through and through. I had the California burger and my boyfriend had the Swiss Mushroom burger. Both had good flavor and the patties were juicy so we weren&apos;t lacking in that department. Excellent bun! It&apos;s slightly sweet, firm to the touch, but it has a very surprisingly fluffy texture when you chew on it. It&apos;s strange but for as many toppings as mine had, it was constructed fairly well. SO well that it didn&apos;t disintegrate in my hands like most burgers will.

The FRIES! The fries were great. Both crispy and sweet potato fries were very crisp and hot out of the fryer. Definite bonus points there!

Thumps up!

I am a big fan of Moonie&apos;s! I have been here several times and it does not disappoint me. To me, it is the best burger I have found in Austin. The buns are also AMAZING!!! YUM YUM!
Before I eliminated red meat from my life, I would get the Western Burger! Heaven in my mouth!! This past weekend I had the turkey burger and it was just as amazing! I love the french fries here too!
Sometimes it can get busy and they only have one cash register so the wait is annoying but it is worth it.
I will continue to come back here for sure.

The first time I went to Moonie&apos;s I had a great experience, the place was packed and the burgers and chicken sammies were great.

Things have gone down hill very quickly. We won&apos;t be back based on our last outing:

1. The employees seem mostly underage, while that isn&apos;t always an indicator of bad service, it was in this case. If there was an adult around I didn&apos;t see one. They mostly just mumbled amongst themselves or stared off in complete boredom. Not one person looked like they wanted to be there, they seemed angry just to have to look at another customer.

2. The ice machine is STILL broken, it dumps out massive amounts of ice, so after you spread out the mound of ice to move your cup under the dispenser, you might get ice, you might get a ton, gambling is fun.

3. 25 minutes for a burger and chicken sandwich. The people in front of us got their two burgers within 5 minutes, out of 6 couples in the entire restaurant we were served last although we ordered second.

4. How can you have a completely dry inedible piece of chicken spray out butter juice when you take a bite, magic? I have no idea how this place went down hill so quickly, maybe its just the current waitstaff, even the fries tasted bored and uninterested.

5. Based on the experiences this year this place is very overpriced. Sell a mediocre product if you want, but don&apos;t charge this much.

There are much better places for your money.

Ive seen the mixed reviews on here, so I had to try it myself. Got the blue cheese burrger..whatever they call it...and the fries. When the burger came, it looked like there was too much bun, but as I was eating it, it seemed almost the right size. Still a little on the large size though but it tastes awesome. Perfectly soft and toasty. The fries are the battered kind. Really good. I didnt have a problem with the service, they seemed nice and helpful enough. I ordered a shake to go, it was blue bell and hand made, and good. I&apos;ll go back and see if I ever have a bad experience like others have.

I was hungggerrryyy on Sunday at almost 8:15 PM. Where to go? Too late for most spots. Too lazy to cook. Oh what&apos;s a food fanatic to do? RING RING &quot;Moonie&apos;s, how may I help you?&quot;  Me - &quot;What time do you close?&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;BE RIGHT THERE&quot; It was almost closing time. The restaurant was pretty empty. Staff was cleaning up. They saw us coming. Stopped cleaning, put on a big genuine smile, and asked &quot;What can we get for you tonight?&quot; GREAT SERVICE already. Loving it already.

My sister got the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich, the lady got a California Burger without the cheese ( saddened me ), and I got the Chile Cheese Burger with Frito&apos;s on top. And for sides, we got the Sweet Potato Fries and some onion rings.

To start, the portions are filling. I struggled (willingly) to finish the meal. The bread tasted slightly sweet and fresh. The Hawaiian wasn&apos;t my favorite because I&apos;ve had one that was so much better. It wasn&apos;t bad but my bias just puts me in a position to judge. The California was excellent. The smooth texture of the avocado mixing with the crisp bacon was a mouthwatering combination. Not to tote the whistle of the person who suggested I get the chili cheese burger, but good lawd that was tasty. The chili didn&apos;t run too much or make the buns soggy. The Fritos on top added an awesome crunch. The cheese held everything together. The onion rings were extra crunchy, even after getting nuked in the microwave. The sweet potato fries needed a slight dusting of salt.

Sadly the menu isn&apos;t that large BUT it makes it easier for me to go back and try EVERYTHING. Don&apos;t judge me.

I wish I could give it two and a half stars, because that is squarely where it falls.  So I&apos;d say Moonie&apos;s is ~okay~.  I probably would not eat there again, but it wasn&apos;t something that couldn&apos;t be cured by a few policy changes.

My first disappointment was when I was told they would only serve my burger well done.  Yuck.  But I was hungry and I&apos;d driven by a hundred times, so I thought what the heck.  I went ahead and ordered the combo and sat down to wait for my order.

The tray arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the food looked good.  I like the buns the burgers are served on.  4 Stars for the buns!  Then the burger... dry.  Why oh why won&apos;t you serve a burger med rare or at LEAST medium.  So I choked down the very dry burger.  Good flavor, but could have been sooo much better if it wasn&apos;t so over cooked.

I&apos;ve seen some people comment on the fries.  I&apos;d give them a 2.5 as well.  Some nice hand cut, medium size, non battered fries could have saved the experience.  I ate a few and sent the rest to the trash.

IF YOU LOVE BLUE CHEESE BURGERS - GO HERE!

Although I ate at Moonie&apos;s a few months ago, how could I ever forget their &quot;Blue Moon&quot; burger and onion rings!  It&apos;s the perfect blue cheese burger topped with blue cheese and thick sliced hickory smoked bacon...can&apos;t ever go wrong with that!  The burger was juicy (definitely 80/20!) and the bun we so fresh it feels homemade (it&apos;s slightly buttered which I love and has a mild sweetness).  Trust me, this place will have you going back for more...I know I will!

BTW the only reason I didn&apos;t give it five stars is because there is still plenty left on the menu I&apos;d like to try...no worries, I&apos;ll be happy to do a follow-up review! =)

Damn fine burger at that Moonie&apos;s.  Stars deducted for ineptitude of staff, and cleanliness, but overall the buger was tasty and hot, fries are crispy, and soda fountain is set to proper proportions (can&apos;t stand it when it&apos;s too syrupy).

Keep it up, Moonie&apos;s.  I&apos;ll be back for more burger indulgence.

This place definitely believes in the quantity over quality approach.  There&apos;s something to be said for that, sure, but it&apos;s generally not the best philosophy.

Place is really crowded for lunch, you&apos;re almost better off having a snack and heading in after 2 or so, the service really slows down.  I got their bleu cheese burger thing, thinking it&apos;d come with wing sauce since that&apos;s what every burger with bleu cheese I have ever eaten comes with.  No.  They didn&apos;t even have wing sauce in the place.  Um, what?

The burger itself wasn&apos;t anything mind blowing, but there was a lot of it and it was cooked as ordered.  Lots of fries that were seasoned well but undercooked.  Good tea and large glasses and free refills.

Again, nothing that will change your life but if you&apos;re in the area and need a greasy burger it&apos;s way better than the burger king at the other end of the parking lot.

I had a good experience. I went on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the Californian (guac and bacon) with blue cheese instead of  pepper jack. It was the tastiest burger I had in a long while. I liked that the buns were slightly sweet and the bacon was very flavorful. I think the burger size was generous and the fries were great - crispy but not dry.

I liked the atmosphere too. It was more small town-y than Austin-y but felt comfortable and not generic.

I had always wanted to try this place. I work close to this location. I rolled in for lunch and ordered my burger. There are signs all over the place with the awards they have won for their burgers. I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo meal. Its over $9. Ironically that seems to be the median price for lunch these days at a non fast food restaurant.  The guy who took my order was very curt. He was not overly friendly but was not rude either. They cook the burgers to order so it took a little longer than normal to get my burger, which was fine. A server brought my food to me when my number came up. The fries are batter dipped fries which were hot and crispy. The burger was huge. I only had 2 complaints with regards to my burger. First of all, it had no flavor at all. How about a pinch of salt and pepper or even season salt? Secondly, I wish they allowed me to cook my burger to my liking. It was a little too done for my tastes. The buns were homemade which was a nice touch. The bacon on the burger was a tad bit on the thin side. You would have thought you could have had thicker sliced bacon.  The burger was hot and juicy so I am not going to count off for the fact that the burger had no flavor or it was not cooked to order.

I did noticed tables were immediately cleaned as customers left. I would like to suggest to get rid of the mayo packets and have a dispenser for mayo. Who wants to grab a handful of packets that might goto waste if you do not use them all?

I do like this place and looking forward to going back.

A great lunch.

I have read reviews from a few of my favorite yelpers and must disagree or hope that their reviews have helped the management fine tune what wasn&apos;t working. I had a buffalo burger and fries with a large drink and it was $8.95 (with tax). The burger was great, not just good, great.

The atmosphere is a kid friendly suburban burger joint, expecting anything more is not their fault. They have self serve drinks, free snow cones with kids meals, hand spun shakes, serve beer (including Stella no doubt), and have a fairly creative menu with burgers and chicken sandwiches with identical options.

Someone said they could get a Fuddruckers burger down the street cheaper-

A. No you can&apos;t, Fuddruckers meal is $8.65 and Moonies meal is $7.99

B. Could you and would you are two different questions.

I went to Moonie&apos;s for lunch with a few friends today - I ordered the veggie burger and turned it into a combo meal.

The price is really reasonable ($4.99) - I appreciate that they don&apos;t charge you more for a veggie burger than a beef burger.  The veggie patty was okay - some sort of mixture of a Gardenburger and a black bean patty.  Bun was delicious, veggies were fresh.

I got the combo meal ($3 more) and added on fries and a 32 oz drink. First of all, who needs to drink 32 ounces?  The cup was about the size of my face - a little unnecessary, IMO.  I&apos;d say they should cut down the size of the drink and then reduce the cost of turning into a combo meal.

The fries were good - hot, crispy on the outside.  I think they are standard boxed fries though as I&apos;ve had really similar stuff before.

Service was a little bit of a miss - my two friends ordered right before me and probably had their food for a solid ten minutes before I got mine.  Sometimes veggie patties take longer to cook (usually b/c they are frozen), but it would have been nice of the cashier to mention this so I knew to expect a wait.

Overall, a pretty decent place to hit up for lunch - the menu looks interesting so maybe I will try a different sandwich and they have Blue Bell ice cream shakes which are always a winner.

This place reminds me of everything I hate about living in suburbia: smart-ass children, rampant obesity, high schoolers, Ugg boots, cell phone belt clips, troll-like children with one giant eyebrow,  bad food, etc., etc.

So, I walk up to the line to order my burger. There is only one line. There are like 15 high school kids working here, I had no clue what all of them were doing, but only one of them was taking orders. The guy in front of me took about 15 minutes to order 4 burgers. I ordered the Hawaiian burger. It came with pineapple and teriyaki sauce.

I take my seat and across from me fat dad and fat son were sitting with squirrely dad and squirrely son after some kind of sport&apos;s practice Dads were talking about sports, kids were high on sugar. Dear dads, get these kids an instrument or a sewing machine or something because from the looks of them they obviously suck at sports.

My burger and fries came out quickly. I was disappointed to find out that it wasn&apos;t fresh pineapple, and the hamburger patty was too well-formed to have not been frozen. The fries were about in the 50th percentile range.

Do these people not follow trends? Don&apos;t they know that every burger place right down the street serves burgers with fresh patties and all-organic everything for a cheaper price? How can this be?

Being in these surroundings with these people and this food was making me write a review in my head. I just couldn&apos;t handle it anymore. I finished my Stella and hustled out.

The one redeeming thing that happened that night though was as I was walking out some kid broke up with his girlfriend who was sitting across from him. As she turned to hide her tears from the rest of the restaurant, she looked directly at me with mascara running down her cheeks.

I felt her pain. I too had been disappointed that night.

With a name like &quot;Moonie&apos;s&quot;, I was expecting this place to be more of a &apos;50s diner than a country-bumpkin road house, if it had any shtick at all.  I almost felt like I was in the back woods of Arkansas.  I think &quot;Boonie&apos;s&quot; is a better name for this place.  When I walked in and heard annoyingly twangy country music, I nearly walked right out, but I figured since I&apos;d wasted the gas getting over there, I might as well stay and eat.

So I ventured to the counter and ordered a Plain Jane with cheddar, and some onion rings.  Grabbed my number and filled my drink.  I&apos;d heard they had Coke Zero on tap here, but I was disappointed when I spied an &quot;out of order&quot; sign on it.  So I got iced tea, which was made very well.  But how can you really mess up iced tea?

My burger and onion rings were brought out quickly.  It looked good, and I couldn&apos;t wait to dig in.  The first several bites were nothing but bun, as my burger had a huge pillow of a bun that tasted like a dinner roll.  It was too much, so I removed the bottom bun.  And once I did so, I realized just how small the burger was that I&apos;d paid about $7 for (my entire bill was over $11 for a burger, rings, and a fountain drink).  I can get a much bigger mediocre burger and rings at the Lakeline Fuddrucker&apos;s location for the same price.

The meat itself was overcooked, and I didn&apos;t like the spices they used.  I discovered fennel seeds on the burger, which pissed me off.  Some people like licorice, but not me.  The cheese, lettuce and mayo made the burger almost bearable.  Almost.  I got slightly more than halfway through the burger, but it was too mediocre for me to finish.

The rings weren&apos;t too bad, so I concentrated on those.

Thankfully, the powers that be randomly shut off the twang-fest country music that was playing, so I didn&apos;t feel compelled to leave quite as quickly as I originally had.

I expected a lot more from Boonie&apos;s.  My mistake, I guess.  And so, my search for Austin&apos;s best burger continues.
