 Pages : 1 [ 2 ] canabiz Jul 9th, 2007, 09:21 PM That&apos;s awsome! But I do believe dumpster diving is illegal is it not?

It ain&apos;t cheating if you don&apos;t got caught!

and it&apos;s good for the environment too, people is actually recycling stuff ;-) convoluted Jul 10th, 2007, 02:30 AM 100% true:

The Billionaire CEO of a very large cable/phone/internet company doesn&apos;t wash his hands after going for a number 2.

I guess you don&apos;t need to wash your hands if you don&apos;t wipe. And with that amount of money, I&apos;m sure there can be bidets in every room. :) Steeve Urkel Jul 10th, 2007, 05:26 AM At one of the Ottawa Superstore the are supposed to throw out the cooked chickens and hot food at the end of the night like they do at other loblaws.

At superstore, they just throw some kind of cover over the chicken and patatoes and fries and leave it there- so you are buying days old chicken if u go in the morning a lot of times.

Also at Foodbasics whenever they have a sale on yogurt for 30cents a cup or the $1 sour cream or anything cheap, they do not refrigerate the products and they sit in the store unrefrigerated on a skid or wooden platform all day long or until the products are gone.

I have seen them do this many many times.

So, if there happenes to be a sale at Foodbasics try and walk over to the fridge section because they usually have a few items of the same there too- but people never bother to check there also.

I only buy stuff at Foodbasics if it is in the fridge chest and only items that are at the back as they are usually the coldest ones;)

I don&apos;t work for Foodbasics, but shop there almost every day it is beside my house so you see what happens there a lot. felix Jul 10th, 2007, 06:00 AM Infonec uses returned parts in their pre-built machines (and probably many small computer shops do as well).

So, if there happenes to be a sale at Foodbasics try and walk over to the fridge section because they usually have a few items of the same there too- but people never bother to check there also.

This probably depends on the food basics, as I have never seen that happen at my local ones. The yogurt when on sale is always in the chest freezer when it is on sale. However, I have been to 1 store locally which I have overheard a staff say to another at checkout&quot;if anyone asks about the oranges, they are good&quot;which made me never want to buy produce from that one again. The other food basics are much cleaner I find. Asmegin Jul 19th, 2007, 12:50 AM Also, it is illegal for the security gaurds to touch you before you leave the store. You can shove Anything you want into your pockets and if they see you, they follow you and wait for you to leave the main doors before they get you. If you pull the stuff out of your pockets and leave it in the store, no crime.

False.

Canadian Criminal Code Section 322 (2):
A person commits theft when, with intent to steal anything, he moves it or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable.

Under Canadian Criminal Code Section 494 (2):
Any one who is

(a) the owner or a person in lawful possession of property, or

(b) a person authorized by the owner or by a person in lawful possession of property,

may arrest without warrant a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence on or in relation to that property.


The reason they wait for you to leave the store is because it&apos;s harder to get the charges to stay in court if you didn&apos;t leave the store (unless it&apos;s an obvious theft like the one you described). It&apos;s not worth the time and effort if the person is going to dump the stolen item before they leave. Mr D J Jul 26th, 2007, 12:40 PM Thought I&apos;d add some things as well, although they were most likely said already.

McDonald&apos;s.
Timers are never followed. Simply resetting them is a daily routine and even managers do that sometimes. Sometimes, timers are not even used whatsoever so meat or chicken may be lying around there for 8 hours (especially grilled chicken). During the rush, grill is barely cleaned at all... and instead of putting 8 patties on it, workers try to fit in as many as they can (I think we were able to put 21 on it once). The products that were dropped on the floor are wasted, and only once I&apos;ve seen someone pick up something off the floor and sell it. Sometimes, the oil used for nuggets is not changed for a long time and turns almost black and there are nuggets swimming around in it. Well done meat = extremely overcooked... usually an old patty is taken from the tray and goes through another cooking procedure on the grill, and when it comes out, it looks extremely nasty. Also, 1/4 pounder meat looks very very nasty when it comes off the grill... there is lots of blood on it and sometimes parts of it aren&apos;t even cooked.

Best Buy
Sales assistants will try to sell you the PSP/PRP at all costs. Their schedule depends on their PSP sale percentage. Basically, PSP/PRP = 100% profit for BB. Sales associates who are not able to sell enough PSPs are usually fired or get around 10 hours a week. As many people pointed out, Best Buy associates usually know nothing about the product they are selling. They just tell you whatever it says on the price tag.

I worked at many other jobs but I don&apos;t think any of you will ever use their service, so no point of talking about them anyways... gabrielle Jul 26th, 2007, 12:51 PM What&apos;s PSP/PRP? Mr D J Jul 26th, 2007, 01:13 PM What&apos;s PSP/PRP?

Performance Service Plan/Product Replacement Plan. Basically, extended warranty. majesus Jul 26th, 2007, 03:30 PM I remember the argument made by vegetarians (in several published videos, not just&quot;talk&quot;) that if the developed nations grew edible food instead of raised meat animals - especially cows - world hunger would end because you could feed 10x more.

I thought that was an exaggerated claim until I started working in the farming industry.... and now I&apos;m inclined to believe it! The amount of crops that go towards just feeding animals (+75%) is staggering... those dang cows eat tons of food to produce... well... a cow. A 1000lb cow will not feed nearly as many people as would the crops grown to feed humans instead. Not to mention that pasture/grazing areas could be crops as well.

Meat is a super-expensive commodity in that regard (good thing it&apos;s heavily subsidized.) Ranching gets decent money though, and the ranchers grow much of their own food - but so many more people could have been fed by growing human food instead of fodder....

I heard rasing poultry is even more expensive. majesus Jul 26th, 2007, 03:35 PM In regards to dumpster diving:

Agreed, I never see anymore bottles or cans littered anywheres. I wish we would start a return deposit on other garbages. We should charge a penny a cig butt, that would really clean up the streets. Hugh Jass Jul 26th, 2007, 06:19 PM A bit of useless information:

The Irish Embassy Pub at Yonge and Wellington sells more Guinness than any other pub in Canada. skategoat Jul 26th, 2007, 07:05 PM Speaking of dumpsters, if you go to the Trek factory in Wisconsin, you will see a dumpster in the parking lot full of frames from competitive manufacturers. Some are cut up, others are perfect. Maybe if you ask nicely, they&apos;ll let you&quot;recycle&quot;a few of those. demanche Jul 26th, 2007, 07:10 PM Heres a tidbit I learned from my employment:

In the US its not so legal for drug companies to keep track of the amount of drugs that their customers (doctors) prescribe to patients weekly/bi-weekly/monthly... if they notice a spike in prescriptions they cut off the freebies and charge full price

:idea: so they pay a 3rd party company to collect the data and sell it back to them, as well as collecting personal info on doctors so they can target the doctors more efficently :idea: (they have kids? whats the wifes name? shes pregnant? ;) ) BlueMax Jul 26th, 2007, 10:09 PM In regards to dumpster diving:

In California, there&apos;s a nickel charge&amp;refund for cigarette butts. Just imagine bums or kids everywhere sweeping the streets clean of all those @#$^ butts! Too bad they wouldn&apos;t take that up a notch and somehow reward for pounds of trash or something. :) majesus Jul 27th, 2007, 11:13 AM In California, there&apos;s a nickel charge&amp;refund for cigarette butts.

Yeah I wish... You would see some very clean cities. California has one of the most heavly regulated laws to keep the environment clean.

if they have it here.. im sure bums can easily make 10 bux an hour just sweeping king/bay vicinity. dealtaker Jul 27th, 2007, 02:35 PM Tims...

Re: the spoon... we are supposed to put it in an cup of ice and change the ice/rinse it out every so often (generally when the ice melts). There shouldn&apos;t be a problem unless the employee drops the spoon or leaves it out on the counter or something.

Yeah unless someone brings in their own dirty cup and they use the same spoon.
I saw this happen.
Not at Timmies mind you but at the A&amp;W heading south in Red Deer.
I would suspect it happens at Tim&apos;s as well. slim_shady Jul 27th, 2007, 03:34 PM False.

Holding merchandise in your pocket while browsing the store is not proof of intent to steal (maybe you&apos;re just keeping your hands free to do more shopping!). This point is further proven by the almost impossible task of convicting someone for theft at a retail store if they never left the building. ak-47 Jul 27th, 2007, 04:47 PM agree, i always do that for small items when i dun hv a basket/cart, sometimes managers stare at me thinking i&apos;m stealing, which is pretty funny :twisted: bigshotceo Jul 27th, 2007, 04:53 PM Holding merchandise in your pocket while browsing the store is not proof of intent to steal (maybe you&apos;re just keeping your hands free to do more shopping!). This point is further proven by the almost impossible task of convicting someone for theft at a retail store if they never left the building.

Keep in mind, though, that if they saw you take it they can demand you give them back the item while you&apos;re still in the store (since you haven&apos;t paid for it yet, it still belongs to them) and if you refuse to do so it would be theft, which they can arrest you for. slim_shady Jul 27th, 2007, 07:00 PM Keep in mind, though, that if they saw you take it they can demand you give them back the item while you&apos;re still in the store (since you haven&apos;t paid for it yet, it still belongs to them) and if you refuse to do so it would be theft, which they can arrest you for.

Correct, but they&apos;d need to walk a fine line to ensure they make no mention of shoplifting or theft suspicion during the altercation as that would be false accusation. Siefer999 Aug 28th, 2007, 10:24 PM im sure most of you already know this but some cineplex&apos;s theatres are so close to each other that they are basically competing against themselves.

they strategically divert big blockbusters from theatres that they know are going to be busy anyways, to theatres that get less traffic.

example being scarborough town centre. they will be busy on a friday and saturday night regardless of what movies are playing. in order to support other theatre nearby, they will not show some big movies that are released. it is not because STC Famous Players cant afford to purchase rights to show the movie as some people assume, they just choose not to. cassey48 Aug 28th, 2007, 11:29 PM they strategically divert big blockbusters from theatres that they know are going to be busy anyways, to theatres that get less traffic.

oh, that is why the STC Famous Players didn&apos;t play The Simpsons, Shrek, and even Harry Potter! Jaytee Aug 28th, 2007, 11:40 PM Interesting. I use to live in STC and it use to drive me crazy they wouldnt have the latest blockbuster. That was years ago, that sucks that they are still doing that.

You can always try Morningside Cineplex which is ridiculously close to STC. domvex Sep 8th, 2007, 12:34 AM I worked part-time for over than five years at an indoor family amusement park within a mall (Can you guess the location?) Although rules regarding pricing, fares, amount/duration of each ride and general policies can vary from amusement park to amusement park, there is one consistent trouble spot to watch out for: ball pits. The ball pits are generally very dirty - little kids pee, sneeze, bleed, spit and so on while in the ball pits, making them a very dirty place to let your kids play. Kids will grab,&quot;swim&quot;, dunk themselves, and even dive to the bottom of the pit to look for their lost socks and other items. The balls themselves were cleaned 3-4 times per year in a ball washing machine, but the balls in the pit can get dirty very quickly; we were quite good with rules and regulations, and actually had the time to clean the ball pits during weekdays (except during summer), so I can imagine how often a larger or less-reputable amusement location tended to their ball pit stations. Whenever employees brought their families to the park, they usually advised their relatives&quot;not to play in the balls - they&apos;re off limits today!&quot; Siefer999 Sep 8th, 2007, 12:49 AM I worked part-time for over than five years at an indoor family amusement park within a mall (Can you guess the location?)

Ah, learned something today I was always wondering about. I used to be so mad at them because they wouldn&apos;t show stuff like Pokemon or other big ones. tet8suo Sep 8th, 2007, 01:31 PM Yeah, I was surprised that they were not showing The Simpsons Movie. Hugh Jass Sep 8th, 2007, 01:44 PM Royal Bank Plaza downtown Toronto, about a month ago a man walked into the main branch of RBC and demanded cash or else he was going to set off a bomb in his backpack. The branch was shut down ( as were the neighbouring streets) as bomb disposal experts cleared the danger.
http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20070801/bank_bomb_070801?hub=TorontoHome


Fun fact, not yet known by the general public: The bank robber was a customer of Royal Bank :-0

Further details available if anyone cares. Chrispy Sep 8th, 2007, 04:54 PM It was for TD Bank, around 10 years ago haha. Policy doesn&apos;t work out, so its history now. Try asking for it now, theyll probably laugh in your face haha

Well likely yeah, considering that every TD I ever go into nowadays is like a party...lol, they&apos;re alllllwwayyys busy preshans Sep 8th, 2007, 11:58 PM heard this from a friend of a friend. places that charge for parking (i.e. CNE, Ontario Place) get ripped off by the cashier at the gate. they will receive the money from the paying customer, if the customer does not ask for receipt, they just let them in and pocket the money.

dunno if thats true now.

this is quite common...i had a friend who used to work at the STC krispy kreme. The price of 3 dozen donuts is like 19.97. it&apos;s near 20 bucks. the guy won&apos;t enter it in the cash register. he&apos;d jus slip in his apron. n the bmanager doesn&apos;t always loko at surveillance. he and his friend made alot. Im talking hundredz. i guessing that also factored into the closing of Krispy Kreme? Kommander_KornFlakes Sep 9th, 2007, 02:07 AM they strategically divert big blockbusters from theatres that they know are going to be busy anyways, to theatres that get less traffic.



Hmmmm that explains why we don&apos;t get half the blockbusters at my local huge Famous Players&quot;Coliseum&quot;while nitwit small Famous Players screens elsewhere get them all. soviette Sep 17th, 2007, 10:42 PM That&apos;s the biggest crock of **** I&apos;ve EVER heard. Our chain hires INDEPENDENT contractors to perform health and safety checks, and they&apos;ve NEVER found ANY evidence of rodents... yet alone&quot;birds&quot;LOL. And if they did, head office would be all OVER our ***** to get rid of them. Yes, we are a big box store.

at sobeys we had a bird come in once, if they come it its by receiving, usually. its rare tho. ants can be an issue and flies are definalty terrible. Jaytee Sep 17th, 2007, 11:17 PM There is a bird in the Loblaws on Queen Quay in Toronto. Ive seen it many times when I worked across the street. It would be very hard to catch I would imagine. It has access to fresh fruit and veggies daily so I assume its still there. :) abu_sme Sep 18th, 2007, 05:23 AM I worked for a ghetto, but national chain of electronics stores, one that has 800 locations across canada (hmm, I wonder which one). If we scanned something and the price came up as $19.99 but the sign says $29.99 we over ride the price and charge you $29.99. It&apos;s un-official company policy, they don&apos;t put it in the policy books because they can be leaked to the public, but it is pretty much the norm for the company.

One time when I was working there I scanned up a cigarette light adapter that had gone on clearance for $4.99, but the sign said $39.99. We were told to over ride the price and give them a&quot;free&quot;warranty with it.

Absolute rip-off, don&apos;t shop there, and if you are forced to, look at the receipt, if the sku number has an (o) next to it, the price has been over-ridden. The best practice is to have the sales monkey show you the stock lookup screen.

CorSter Sep 19th, 2007, 01:27 AM Scarborough Town Centre, and Cineplex not wanting movies, is an excuse, period.

AMC Kennedy Commons is a direct competitor to the Famous Players in that area. AMC and Famous have always had a sort of unwritten agreement, that AMC would back off on movie acquisitions at Interchange (next to Cineplex&apos;s largest theater, Colossus), providing that Famous Players backed off in Scarborough.

I don&apos;t know about Interchange, but Kennedy Commons almost never gets the huge hits unless it&apos;s a real blockbuster expected to hit $300 million. The only big summer titles they had at that location were Spider-man 3, Pirates 3 and Harry Potter 5. No Transformers, no Die Hard 4, no Simpsons. But this location is quite good for smaller films. zedsky Sep 23rd, 2007, 01:15 PM At a bank my friend used to work at they moved locations years ago and was a very old bank. During this transfer old papers were misplaced or magically disappeared.

Now way back people used to put up securities for loans or mortgages which the bank would hold onto in their vault till debt was repaid. These securities were moved into the new vault but are very old and about 90% of them the bank has no clue who owns and since its been 20+ years I guess no one knows about their relatives having owned them and therefore cannot claim ownership.

Bonds? stocks? who knows what treasures are in there. I can only imagine how much they would be worth now.

One thing my friend did mention though he says he might have misheard but supposedly some of these securities are missing or have been lost..go figure how things in a VAULT go missing....and there is nothing that can be done about any going missing because their is no ownership of these items.

That is my secret...well technically my friends but my friend doesn&apos;t work there anymore so I doubt she cares. BlueMax Sep 23rd, 2007, 02:36 PM High-ranking bank employees stealing unclaimed funds? Say it ain&apos;t so!
Too bad my time in the bank would lead me to agree.... Shysters!

There was a very prevalent attitude of gimme-gimme&apos; greedy money-grubbers from all sides. The banks are only interested in making more money - period, and so are their more&quot;successful&quot;employees. miss_swan Oct 14th, 2007, 05:41 AM I don&apos;t know if this happens at other Wendy&apos;s or not, but I have a co-worker who told me that he used to work at Wendy&apos;s and burnt burgers and burgers that accidentally fell on the floor were ground up and put in the chili. He told me never ever order chili from Wendy&apos;s.

Another one. My high school buddy used to work at Canadian Tire years ago. He told me that every Timex watch cost Canadian Tire $12 regardless of what the retail price was.

Too late. Just had some and it was yummy. I&apos;m a junk food freak. :cheesygri

Well, I never frequent the ot section of rfd so I never hit this thread. Great stuff here. I&apos;ll chime in with some interesting stuff.

- if you ever get admitted into a psych hospital always be adamant that you have all your possessions itemized and taken care of. Don&apos;t be a jerk about it (of course, if you&apos;re a psych admission who knows how your attitude and mental health will be at that time of admission. You may be in 4 point restraint ...) and hopefully you&apos;ll get all of your stuff back upon discharge. Yes, it sounds like common sense but it&apos;s all about the human inefficiency .. and psych units are the same. Some people care ... and some don&apos;t.

- a good friend of mine had a sweet job. He was a&quot;fluffer&quot;for a local dancer/strip club that was well known.&quot;Fluffer&quot;I mean by he was the one that&quot;massaged&quot;the girls boobs to get them&quot;warmed&quot;up - so to speak - before they went out to perform. At least back in the day the level of technology for implantations would lead to some firmness and such that it may not look&quot;right&quot;during movement and it would necessitate some massaging to get the implants to behave right, or at least to look less implant-ish. Not sure how much of an issue it is now for the implant world ... but he was in boob-heaven. He&apos;s always a barrel full of laughs at parties. Such is the inner world of strippers.

- many staff (ie: nursing) self-medicate and will steal or&quot;pocket&quot;medications like ativan (lorazepam) etc ... especially at workplaces that have poor checks and balances for their controlled drugs/narcotics. Don&apos;t ask me how I know ... I just know. But this shouldn&apos;t be a big surprise ... people come in all size and shapes and if you&apos;re in the medical field with direct access to controlled drugs then some are tempted by them.

- the cement they use for surgical procedures like a Total Knee Arthroplasty (like a Zimmer) is exothermic. In 3-4 minutes a small egg-shaped amount will heat up like a hot hard boiled egg straight out of the water and will be too hot to hold. A good practical joke to play on rookie nursing or medical students. A fellow medical student almost dropped the cement into the sterile surgical field ... he would have been killed by our surgeon if that would have happened. :lol:

- back in the day I would sort mail at the post office during the xmas rush and we would hand sort them. People do read your postcards from hawaii, mexico ... before sending them out to the proper address block. I read a postcard from Blue Rodeo to some private ugy once. Interesting. jayisthebest88 Oct 14th, 2007, 06:36 AM I worked at Zellers and the things that are in stock are amazing. If you look at the back of a shelf you just might see a Brand New Nintendo Entertainments System still there from the early 90&apos;s and if you scan them they are still the same price as they were backthen!

The organization and inventory turnover is pretty sad, and as a result, you can find many retro items in zellers. The next time you are shpping at zellers, just look around, reach towards the back of shelves, maybe you will get your hand on some 90&apos;s thing that you thought yo uwold never see again.

Just last week, I got my hands on a Original Game Boy(the big fat bulky one), when I went to the till, they were amazed that it was still there. Needless to say, I am playing Pokemon Red right now.

If a prank causes a nursing or med student to compromise patient care, the prank is then probably not worth doing... miss_swan Oct 14th, 2007, 11:17 AM If a prank causes a nursing or med student to compromise patient care, the prank is then probably not worth doing...

Well, I certainly do not disagree there. All in all though, the student was relatively far away from the field and would have to almost throw the item ... which is what he almost did. I guess that&apos;s not much of a rebuttal. :cheesygri

It was more of a learning experience ... perhaps with some information left out and not knowing exactly how a person would react. towhytea Oct 16th, 2007, 10:52 PM Almost every grocery store on the price tags have price per unit for example .667 cent for 100ml this comes in very handy when your a college student or trying to figure out weather the 24 of coke is cheaper then the 12 per unit

If you are looking for some&quot;old&quot;items AP has a lot of canned and packaged items from even 4 or 5 years ago!

I saw some Incredible Hulk packaged pudding last week, it was a powder mix.
It was from when then movie came out.

Also I would watch out with the frozen juices.
All of this summer at the ottawa location they were selling a lot of juices that expired in 2006.

I know this because one day I decided to buy some juices there and they have the&quot;fresh or free&quot;policy and every juice I picked up like powerade and Bacardi coolers was very old.

So, always check the dates on the items as they have so much expired there.:lol: Steeve Urkel Oct 17th, 2007, 02:58 AM [QUOTE=miss_swan;5763427]Too late. Just had some and it was yummy. I&apos;m a junk food freak. :cheesygri

Interesting,
one of my friends that I&apos;ve known for about 15 years is an&quot;exotic dancer&quot;and I&apos;ve never seen any of these&quot;fluffers&quot;you are talking about and I visited my friend at work many times...and since i&apos;m a girl was also allowed in the change rooms, so know firsthand what the do.

I was really curious of my friends job so spent a couple hours there hanging out with her , didn&apos;t want to see my friend&quot;dance&quot;though...

I do know that a lot of the dancers they sometimes share their underwear without washing it.
They also share their makeup a lot of times too.

I never did see any men in the backstage changing areas or washrooms. men are usually not allowed there.

Also I learned that there are a lot of creepy men there who think&quot;regular&quot;girls in clothes should strip also. I wore normal clothing to meet my friend and found that out pretty quick also.

a whole truck full of watermelons costs 200 or 300 bucks from florida/texas

the trucks go right onto the fields and are boxed/loaded up... Most of the time the boxes go untouched untill the consumer picks out the watermelons they want out of the box in the grocery store.

Problem is a lot of times the boxes also hold different kind of surprises, snakes, spiders...

Saw a few Black widows, which is pretty hard to spot between watermelons.


it doesnt happen often but it does happen so next time u reach in to get a watermelon from the bottom of the box you may want to be more cautious miss_swan Oct 17th, 2007, 03:20 AM [QUOTE=miss_swan;5763427]

My friend was a cousin of the proprietor ... and the proprietor was/is a business affiliate of the HA. I was not trying to infer that it was a standard practice in the industry. I wouldn&apos;t know anyways. All I know was that this was a quasi-&quot;responsibility&quot;of his and it was probably a voluntary, locally-developed kind of activity for him so-to-speak. He didn&apos;t break his back taking care of all the girls ... but when someone asked he was quick to oblige, at least in the beginning as you would expect from a guy.

It didn&apos;t hurt that he was 6&apos;3&quot;, really good lookin&apos; dude, buff .. and the ladies loved having him around ... and he was related to management in a close way - who sign their checks, bookings, whatever.

He was a local legend ... who actually tried to walk the thin line between normalacy and whispered rumor with the HA. Something that I would not like to live with personally. I&apos;ve already said too much ... I hear motorcycles coming up my driveway. :lol:

For the record, this is BC we&apos;re talkin&apos; about and I only went into this establishment like 2-3 times. I always felt grungy going into a strip bar or what they liked to call a gentleman&apos;s club. I&apos;d rather go for a quesadilla at Earl&apos;s (restaurant), have some drinks a some good laughs. bigbug Oct 17th, 2007, 10:37 AM Royal Bank Plaza downtown Toronto, about a month ago a man walked into the main branch of RBC and demanded cash or else he was going to set off a bomb in his backpack. The branch was shut down ( as were the neighbouring streets) as bomb disposal experts cleared the danger.

Further details available if anyone cares.

I don&apos;t know why.

He asked for a withdrawal from his account, then said he wanted $75,000 cash or he&apos;d blow up the building. Security kept him talking as the cops came. They just ran in and tackled him to the ground. A bit stupid of them, if you ask me, what if he did have a bomb and saw them running for him? *boom* st7860 Oct 17th, 2007, 02:18 PM [QUOTE=Steeve Urkel;5778896]

Oni-kun Oct 17th, 2007, 03:08 PM Anything perishable that is returned to a grocery store is tossed. If you buy a 50 dollar turkey and come back with it 2 days later or whatever amount of time (unless you bought it 5 minutes ago) its going in the garbage. The store will not take the risk that you did not store the product properly.

If you want to exchange something you bought at RCSS at Loblaws or vice-versa that is a non-company label product just &apos;lose&apos; your reciept and they won&apos;t know you didn&apos;t buy it there and you can do an exchange.

Those&quot;fresh&quot;fruit salads, cut up veggies, and salads are not made at the store. Some fruits such as pinnapple and watermelon are cut in store. But everything else comes in tubs and they just take it out and put it in containers. Oni-kun Oct 17th, 2007, 03:28 PM There is a bird in the Loblaws on Queen Quay in Toronto. Ive seen it many times when I worked across the street. It would be very hard to catch I would imagine. It has access to fresh fruit and veggies daily so I assume its still there. :)

At my new job at Hollisters, one thing I recently learned is that if you find an object in the wrong place (ie, a 50$ shirt in the 20$ shirt shelf), we have to give it to you for the price you claim. So feel free to say that 50$ pair of jeans was in clearance for 20$, we will give it to you.

Also, you can return things without a receipt, but you will only get store credit. Oh, and if there&apos;s a 50$ shirt you want, and it&apos;s close to the end of the season, the price is dropped considerably when the next season begins.

How much did you pay for the Game Boy? philelmo Oct 28th, 2007, 01:55 AM at RBC or CIBC, we need to do weekly goalsheets and need to sell enough products, mark it on the goal sheet, and show the ***** . manager. Bank managers are really sales managers. They coach you if you don&apos;t have enough sales. If you get alot, they want more. You might get a job as a personal banker/account manager/financial planner, but that just means you need to sell more. There are zero commissions for tellers, just a pat on the back.

at Rogers stores, the computers are locked down&quot;like Fort Knox&quot;-Rogers help desk. They often change the administrative password. I heard someone got in trouble for creating a internet explorer shortcut?? Rogers tills and computers are crap. I have to go through 20 pages of documentation to swap their HD&apos;s and computers. Rogers&apos; helpdesk can remotely login to any till within 15 seconds. Their solution to 90% of employee reported problems are to swap the till.

at Shaw, technical support ppl are required to sell products to you. they make $2.25 for xtreme upgrade, $6 for phone... etc. customer service (who take these kind of calls on a daily basis) make commissions on almost every call, they might get $400-500 more than technical support. customer service and technical support are paid the same wage. Shaw&apos;s phone is completely unreliable as there is no backup generator on any node. If the power goes out, it is almost guaranteed your phone will be dead. Often your alarm is triggered.

If the customer fights about it, yes. In all instances they will try to assure you it is infact 50$ instead of 20$, but if you insist they have to give it to you for 20$.

I know 5-8 years ago (before bootlegging became really popular) I had friends who were renting 10+ movies/games a week. These guys had major influence at our store, if they rented something and didn&apos;t like it, they brought it back and were given another rental no problem. (Obviously they brought it back like the same day)

I also remember one of them went in one day to pickup a movie or something, and the girl at the counter took forever to run them through. He flipped on her and we never saw her at that location again. I think she was moved/transferred just for pissing him off! :confused: masterballer Oct 29th, 2007, 12:14 AM So you can write anything you like? like for example this girl&apos;s got a nice ***** and silly stuff like that? :lol:

I&apos;ve worked directly in situations where open fraud was occuring. Situations where contractors controlled which other contractors were hired and of course kickbacks were being handed out.

My favourite is the times when a contract is running out but money is left over in the contract so the contractors all work overtime DOING NOTHING just to bill the crap out of the government. But wait there&apos;s more... Then the government employees get called in to work OVERTIME DOING NOTHING to test the big fat nothing the contractors have done! It&apos;s all to make the senior beaurocrats look good! It&apos;s really funny to watch it all go down. There&apos;s catered food, sometimes beer and wine provided.

Thanks for the link, much appreciated! dieunguyen Oct 31st, 2007, 11:07 PM I work at a Tim Horton&apos;s and I must say, there is nothing wrong with them! They are&quot;perfect&quot;! I eat food there everytime I work even though I work there! (Cause a lot of times people don&apos;t eat food from where they work).

Just to clear things up though.

The stirring spoons are kept in a cup with ice and a little bit of water, when the ice melts, we change the cup.

Employees are required to use a straw to stir coffee in a customer&apos;s mug and then dispose the straw. Anyone caught using the spoon to stir coffee in the a mug is fired.

Usually when customers complain that we miscounted the number of timbits we gave them, we usually give them more. Like if I gave you only 18 in a 20 pack of timbits, then you get 6 more instead of just 2. syn3rgetic Oct 31st, 2007, 11:43 PM at serco drivetest centers, we can fail your written just because we want to, and theres nothing u can do about it, because we&quot;shred&quot;the test papers...

I had a tag on my account once and I was pretty shocked. The problem was not me however, it was the fact that Blockbuster just didn&apos;t clear their returned items box nearly enough (it is probably a lower volume one in my area). Whenever something was legitimately late, I paid, but sometimes I would drop off the video into the return box around 7pm the night it was due and the next time they would tell me it was late because the goofs they have working their don&apos;t check in the box items until the next morning when they don&apos;t feel like it.

So one time I was disputing when a manager came and started yelling about this not being the first time, I always try to weasel out of late fees and it won&apos;t happen this time etc etc. I was like whatever bye, no more Blockbuster again. Haven&apos;t been in years. spyd4r Nov 13th, 2007, 11:17 PM Futureshop Knowledge


Look at the bottom (left) i think it is for the cost value on an item.

14999 would be a cost of $149.99..

Just get them to&quot;Check Inventory&quot;and eyeball the screen, so you will know if you have much room to haggle the price.

I worked at FS back about 8 years ago and it was true back then and I checked it out when I bought my Polk Audio RTi10&apos;s in the summer... so unless the systems have changed in the last few months... this is still true.

I believe they changed this quite a long time ago, same goes with the&quot;internal item value&quot;numbers on the price tags, they are no longer there. But keep these juicy stories comming.

Yeah most of the parking lots that allow you to charge to credit card dont have some database they check, they just scan the exp dates.

&quot; CSIFan29 Nov 25th, 2007, 06:33 PM I used to work at a banquet hall and the parmasan on the tables (which were sitting out all night during the party in small bowls) were dumped into a larger bowl then re-used until finished. Bread was also the same, it would be put in large garbage bags and re-used for Sunday&apos;s lunches.

Oh, so was wine--bottles would be filled with other bottles until they were full again and then re-corked for re-use. When going to banquet halls or retaurants, make sure the wine is not only corked, but SEALED, too. CSIFan29 Nov 25th, 2007, 06:39 PM Oh, here&apos;s another in the restaurant biz (I should get back into it rather then working in an office so I can get more useful info): never order &apos;Zuppa di Pesce,&apos; &apos;Fish Soup,&apos; or any time of mixed fish dish like these. It&apos;s all the fish that&apos;s leftover at the end of the week and then cooked so they don&apos;t have to throw it. Not the worst thing ever, but you&apos;re if you&apos;re paying for a prime fish dish, this isn&apos;t it! Setz Nov 25th, 2007, 06:57 PM Not so much a secret, but rather an interesting piece of info: since I work in a clothing store, I ultimately fold all the clothes unpurchased throughout the day. In every pile of shirts or whatever, we need to have exactly so and so small, exactly so and so large, etc. Essentially, we have to have equal amounts of XS, S, M, L, and XL.

I&apos;ve noticed while folding women&apos;s clothing that we mostly have large and xtra large blue shirts/tops left over, meaning that smaller women like to wear blue clothes out of our selection. Conversely, we have an abundance of smaller white shirts/tops, meaning the opposite.

For guy&apos;s jeans, there&apos;s less brighter color jeans than darker color jeans at the end of the day, meaning men prefer to buy light or medium colored jeans rather than dark jeans. poolking Nov 26th, 2007, 02:35 AM Tell us a secret you know because of your work/experience/etc. that others might not know...


For example...

My uncle/aunt rent the claw machines that allow you to get stuffed animals (regularly found in arcades places) and I found out that the way that thing works is that it has a timer that changes the claws strength. Therefore, if you are playing when the claw is on strong, you are almost guaranteed to get the stuffed animal. In other words, the claw can be weak for 20 min, then switch to strong for 2 min, and then to weak again for 20 min. Those times are adjustable.

Well there are some laws.
I was told for my work when I write up reports on the store employees I am not allowed to use any racist terms to describe people.
I am not allowed to write&quot;the black man&quot;or&quot;the chinese girl&quot;or anything like that.

Apparently in the US you are allowed to write descriptions that include race.
It makes it really weird for my job when I am trying to decribe an employee that could be from another country and I am only allowed to put the&quot;it is a male that is 5&quot;10 and has black curly hair&quot;

Really doesn&apos;t tell you much as it could be anyone really.

Another gross thing i learned through my job is that a lot of the stores and restaurants that serve fountain drinks they never clean the fountain spouts even tho they are supposed to do them often.
So a lot of times there is residue and mould and it affects the taste of the drinks.

Also, some of the 7-11 stores they use expired drink syrup as they never check the dates very often.

I know this cuz I was asked to inspact some 7-11 stores for issues and had to read a training manual. dnyc Nov 29th, 2007, 05:53 AM If the customer fights about it, yes. In all instances they will try to assure you it is infact 50$ instead of 20$, but if you insist they have to give it to you for 20$.

thats not true... all companies would go out of business. customer A finds a pair of jeans for 49.99. Customer A shops around and sees a $20 rack.. and decides to buy $20 jeans instead and puts the $50 jeans in the 20 rack because he/she is lazy to place it back where he/she found it. Customer B sees those 50 dollar pants and goes up to cashier with it oh its 20.

only way you&apos;ll get it for 20 is if its 49.99 on the tag but scans in as 20 then you get 20 no doubt. another way is if the $20 rack had the same few pairs of jeans placed there then yes its 20 but if its the odd one out of the bunch good luck.

I know in Winners this girl I was friends with she would switch the tags on the pants so she would pay less.

I only found out about that later...but still think it is wrong.

Also at winners they have a problem with shoplifting sometimes and people stick the clothing tags in the small spaces in the corners of the fitting rooms.

Also at winners if you find an item without a price tag, they are not supposed to sell it to you.
But I doubt they actually follow that. kleptodathief Nov 29th, 2007, 07:07 AM ya i like winners! put those red stickers on newer close ;) :cheesygri cipher Nov 29th, 2007, 11:05 AM ya i like winners! put those red stickers on newer close ;) :cheesygri

Anyways, I got some tidbits I have to share.

At many RCSS locations, they don&apos;t have ANY filtration for their air circulation, even the air that goes into the freezers. Many times when I would walk into the back to get some stock, any time I would have to go to the freezers, I would see dead flies below the vent in the freezer! Even in the electronics dept there would be dead flies on top of the shelves. Even in the deli and bakery!!! (They actually do cook some of their own bread and pastries, all made from premade ingredients of course)

Rats were also quite a bad problem, even at the newer one that I worked at, there were a lot of dead rats. Our Orkin binder was huge for how old the store was.

RCSS is also probably one of the biggest waster&apos;s of food and pretty anything else they sell. I&apos;ve seen unopened boxes of dishes, bbq&apos;s, and tv&apos;s thrown in the compacter because they received too much and didn&apos;t have any room. Employees can&apos;t take them home even if they are getting thrown out because they would still have to pay full price. I assume they don&apos;t have any kind of liquidation deal with anyone.

That huge sale on a crapload of electronics last year (cameras for $10) was because they were switching to computer assisted inventory (only took them 20 years to figure out that it could help them, many other stores have been using it for MANY years) and they didn&apos;t want to go back and catalog all the old stock that was DNO (Do Not Order). They don&apos;t want to waste time and pay people money for doing that since it is just going to be deleted soon anyways.

If you see anything with a DNO on the label, the price is usually open for negotiation with a supervisor (cashiers don&apos;t get access to lower prices of any items). If there are any display models that have no stock left and aren&apos;t for sale as display models, you can get anywhere from 20% to 60% off, make sure you point out any scratches or anything, with some supervisor&apos;s you can get 10% for each scratch!

If you are looking for something cheap, ask if they have any display models lacking remotes or manuals or even power cords, and you can get anything for dirt cheap because they cannot display it as for sale without the manual missing. They&apos;ll often use 6 digit markdown codes which is pure profit for the dept. You can also go back later and say it didn&apos;t come with a remote, they&apos;ll give you a remote from another display or even a universal one for free.

Inventory is done on the 2nd week of January, and every 3 months after that, so you can usually scope out some cheap accessories for just about anything for .44c if they have more than 10 of them. Even though CAI (its called ELVIS or something) is used, they still manually go and count everything in every dept, look for the white&quot;counted for inventory&quot;stickers on everything and you&apos;ll know it is inventory time, supervisor&apos;s are also very generous for deals to push stock in april, that is when the slow months are at the slowest and they need to push stock.

I got more, maybe later.

But what I want to know is the best way to negotiate a new rogers contract is :D or perhaps if anyone that works at rogers and wants to hook me up with a good plan :D *cough* PM me *cough*

;) gsrce Dec 11th, 2007, 02:48 AM Bleh, just read the whole post...my eyes...they bleeeed...

Finally time to quote a bunch of people, and add my wisdom.


Don&apos;t order pizza (or food) an hour or less before closing. This makes the kitchen guy take a longer time to close the kitchen (i.e. clean and stock the kitchen). If it&apos;s slow during the last hour before closing the kitchen then they have time to clean and get out at a reasonable time. But if they are stuck making orders until closing time it takes WAY longer to finish up .. especially on a friday or saturday then it cuts into his drinking time after work. You don&apos;t want a pissed off cook making you food 10 minutes before closing.

At Pizza Hut, they&apos;d do prep most nights, which consisted of taking dough, and either just saucing it, or putting toppings on it (pep and cheese, etc.), putting the lid on the pizza pan, and putting it underneath the tables for use during the night.

This sort of prep was supposed to be timed, and after a certain amount of time the prep is to be thrown out, due to the dough going hard, sauce drying up, etc.

Quite often employees would make a ton, and have it sit there all night to use. So if you came in 20 minutes before the store closed, you&apos;d be getting hard stale dough/sauce/ingredients, with maybe a little bit of extra cheese thrown on top to make it look good.


KFC Gravy

I can&apos;t tell the dif between the KFC gravy from Famous Players and a regular restaurant, so the powdered stuff they use at the theatres must be pretty close.


At Big Daddy&apos;s bar and grill alot of the prep cooks mix the coleslaw with their hands in rubbermaid tubs....we wash out hands though..but we don&apos;t/didn
t have to wear gloves!

I worked at Local Heroes in Ottawa briefly. It was a very poorly run establishment, as a restaurant is concerned.

They too had people mix big rubbermaid buckets of coleslaw. They get their chicken wings in fresh, but freeze it, and then take it out and soak it under hot water for hours until it&apos;s defrosted.

They also use the same oil they cook the raw chicken in to cook their breakfast potatoes, etc. (and reheat the breakfast potatoes in the deep fryer).


What I heard from managers and others
- Pizza hut never cleans the ovens as it is&quot;flavouring&quot;

All stores in Ottawa have an oven cleaning guy who comes in from Scarborough about once every 3-6 months or so who stays overnight in the restaurant and takes the ovens apart to clean them thoroughly.


all buns, and bread bowls all came frozen, and heated up on a daily basis... nothing is really freshly made there... even the chicken in the salad mix comes in a box... the tuna mix is from a can! Cookie, danishes as well as crossants were all frozen... stuff like icing was added after reheating in their convensional oven..... anyway... just to inform everyone of their&quot;Always Fresh&quot;rule....

When I worked at Timmies about 6 years ago, they were still using fountain drinks for the peach juice, making almost everything from scratch (save the breadbowls and buns for sammichs).

Also, at certain Dairy Queen locations, they&apos;ll have their hot dogs on one of those grill roller things, and at the end of the day they&apos;ll take them off of the grill, and put them in their fridge to reuse the following day.

That&apos;s it from me for now, going to rest my eyes for a bit. heat Dec 11th, 2007, 04:07 AM i worked at tim hortons. Once there was a bee in the fondant (if u guys dont know wht a fondant is, its the stuff on top of ur donut, the chocolate icing, vanilla icing or whtever they have on it). So ya we did not want to throw all that fondant out, since it was rush hour, so the manager came along, scooped it with a spoon!i was like :-0 and then :lol: :lol: . N1QUE24 Dec 11th, 2007, 10:37 AM I work at Empire Theatres.. and we have 2 portable machines that contain either Becel Margarine or Lactantia butter. (They&apos;re basically mini butter pumps that are always in front of the concession stand).

So anyways, when it comes to closing time.. these things are real bizznitches to clean. But anyways, where im going with this is the unbelievably disgusting state of the Becel butter machine at the end of the night.

I open up the machine to take out the left over becel liquid.. and all I see is this really disgusting ring of fat.. looks like lard, but the point is.. this ring of lard is stuck to the bottom.. and it&apos;s really, really sickening. Looks like some sort of jellyfish..

Anyways, that&apos;s my little rant... I&apos;d take a picture next time if I bring my cellphone with me next time. But yeah, pls dont try and kill yourself by asking for becel on top of your butter..

TNX. smirnoff Dec 11th, 2007, 12:40 PM I used to work as a barista at a cafe.

Believe me, when it&apos;s busy it doesn&apos;t matter whether you ask for skim or whole milk, you&apos;re getting whatever milk is ready when it&apos;s time to make your drink. Enjoy!

If you want free flavour in your latte or something then don&apos;t ask for it when you order it, but wait until the barista is already working on it and then say something like &apos;oh yeah, could I get some hazelnut in it&apos;, it&apos;s most likely they aren&apos;t going to trouble themselves to ring up a 50cent flavour shot, I know I never did. Helps if it&apos;s busy. Also, it&apos;s more work to add the 50cent shot to the tab so I would only go out of my way to do it in the first place IF the customer was a jerk. Ebola Dec 11th, 2007, 12:51 PM As for the police having quotas remark:

-Traffic enforcement divisions basically have quotas. Not in the sense that they HAVE to write X amount of tickets per shift.. but management reviews the numbers from time to time and will put pressure on those units if they have lower than average numbers.... because their sole task is supposed to be enforcing traffic violations and then dealing with any other fun **** that occurs during those stops.. (drugs, warrants etc)

-All other units, for example patrols.. have no quotas. board123 Dec 11th, 2007, 12:56 PM I have plenty of secrets at work because I work at ATI.

You will save a couple $ doing that. Also Starbucks always has chocolate powder, cinnamon, milk, cream and honey? on the counter...so enjoy :lol:

I&apos;ve tried that a few times and my own iced coffee was just as good..or crappy as the one I paid more for at Starbucks...seriously:mad: trick91 Dec 12th, 2007, 05:22 AM used to work at a company called Ipsos Reid. We would basically randomly call people in the States, asking them to participate in testing a new television show. We sent them a tape, they would watch it, and we would call them and ask questions.

The trick is that the show was more then a few years old that never aired. The only thing we were interested were was if people remembered certain ads and what they thought of the commercials.

Well that secures your job pretty nicely - provided you don&apos;t turn them against you afterwards. :| hahn Dec 15th, 2007, 02:26 AM Most places like an office have recycle bins for bottle/can, cardboard and paper. However, unlike bottle/can/cardboard, paper to be recycled isnt really worth anything. So, unless the manager / owner of facilities is willing to take a lost and specifically pay extra $ for the cleaners to take them to a recycling drop off. The paper that you put it the&quot;recycle&quot;bin ends up like any other trash, in the big garbage bin out back.

our workplace uses the company shred-it to get rid of confidential documents, it&apos;s supposedly recycled after being shredded (they tell use we saved 14 trees or whatever). obviously this costs money, but since it&apos;s there already, i try to throw every type of paper product inside the shred it box. it just seems wrong to throw out the paper into the trash when you can recycle it.

I used to work for Opinion Search and most of their data is seriously flawed.
They even admitted this on their website...I actually wrote a paper for a class about it also.

But when i worked at Opinion Search- the supervisors were telling the people that asked the survey questions that they could not have a N/A or no answer and that they were forcing people to give an answer.
If that did not work, then most of the people entering the data would just put whatever they thought was right:lol:

I don&apos;t agree with that, as that makes all your polls inaccurate.:mad:

Also when Opinon Search was doing some surveys for Bell or Rogers or some phone company they put in the script that it said we were calling from (Bell or Rogers) and not on behalf of....so that was seriously misleading to a lot of people on the phone.

Also that the supervisors have their own lunch room- they are not supposed to&quot;socialize&quot;with the employees.
So, if a supervisor decides to eat in the employee lunchroom whoever is there will most likely get a stupid lecture later on:lol: Hugh Jass Dec 16th, 2007, 06:01 AM On the survey theme. I once worked at a telephone survey place and they were completely by the book. You said what you saw on the screen and were not allowed to converse with the recipient other than ask the questions. About 5% of the time, you were being listened to. You could of course just press any answer but we were being paid hourly and speed didn&apos;t matter.

Most of the survey places are usually good to work for and honest or professional with their work.

I also know Opinion Search kinda wanted to get rid of me because I foubd out that they made so many mistakes with their work and actually printed that on their website:lol:

Also, that I ended up telling my stepfathers business friends never to hire them for work..after everything I did tell them:lol:

I also worked for 2 other research companies and they were very professional.

IBM- formerly price waterhouse...they are very by the book and very serious to work for.
And they have a cheesy screen saver.

For what, I asked. She said if I was willing to participate, they&apos;d send me two printers to evaluate and as a thank you I&apos;d get to keep the one I prefer. I said&quot;sure&quot;and went back to sleep.

Two weeks later my sister calls me on my cell and tells me there is a big box that arrived at the house for me. I tell her to open it and she tells me there is a brand new printer and a box with pens, CDs , a stopwatch, a long distance calling card, a binder and every type of thing you could print on (paper,envelopes, overheads).

I get home, and get to work. I had to time everything (unpacking, set up time, print times, tech support times etc.) and record my thoughts on sound levels while printing, picture/text quality ). Two weeks later, I get the second printer and repeat all tests.

Two weeks after that I pack up the printer I didn&apos;t choose, along with the binder and test CD and send it back (to California).
Two months later, the printer I kept reaches the market priced @ $600!!

I work at a family photo retailer, and there&apos;s no real&quot;shady&quot;practices, except enjoying when people bring in their naughty photos.

When we adjust prices, it shows on the receipt, we&apos;re really not out to screw the customer, just try to make our margin&amp;goals for the day. No commission, just honest opinions.

On an up-note, we did&quot;have&quot;to do a memory card&gt;cd backup for a customer who happened to have a video of her taking it doggy style from her well hung boyfriend, shot from his POV. It took a couple of extra minutes to finish that order... I wanted to put a&quot;Great shot!&quot;sticker (= free 8x10 print) on the order, but the lab manager thought that was a little too obvious ;-) heinrich Dec 17th, 2007, 02:53 AM &gt;3. Mercury based chamicals were used at golf courses years ago and were&gt;legal because there was like .2 ppm, but as we all know mercury has various&gt;half lifes because it is made up of 7 isotopes, the longest isotope half life is&gt;444 years, and the second longest is 44, the rest are under 1 day each, so for&gt;the most part it breaks down fast.

I gotta call BS on this one... there&apos;s a big difference between stable isotopes and radioisotopes! Mercury has 7 stable isotopes - those aren&apos;t decaying at all. Sure, you can make radioisotopes of mercury, but they aren&apos;t found in nature, and certainly not on golf courses.

To contribute to the thread:
Working at A&amp;P Grocery back in the day (meat&amp;deli), out of date meat was routinely repackaged. Sometimes, if exposure to light had darkened the meat, we would have to flip it over before repackaging.

Having worked in various restaurants as well, I&apos;ll say this - it&apos;s best not to know what&apos;s going on behind the scenes, hygiene-wise. Substance abuse was endemic, leading to plenty of erratic behaviour from chef types... best not to aggravate them! rayner55 Dec 17th, 2007, 03:27 AM Once I took a survey and after answering all the questions the girl on the phone said I&apos;d be perfect.

Where I used to work, we were instructed to charge the highest possible price to &apos;&apos;walk-in&apos;&apos; customers, and those who did not ask or gegociate often were charged up to 50% more for exactly the same room.

You can negociate easier by saying you are a governement employee (about 20-25% rebate, employees never check if you actually work for the gov or not exect for the news ones or the brown nosed ones), a student (about 5%), CAA (5%) or best of all, the over 50 or 60 rebate, can be up to 50%.

So, the best way to do it would be check the prices on the internet (the prices are lower on the website than directly at the hotel or by telephone) and when you are arrive ask for gov emplyee rebate, for a +25% rebate extra. Or you could make the rooms on the name of the over 50 person and just pay individually, and still get the rebate.

The employee at the desk also can lower the price if you say another hotel is cheaper.

One of my friends just asks for the&quot;corporate rate&quot;.
I think he applied for an account at a few hotels, but also mentions that he books a lot of musicians in hotels across north america.
He really does though, but he seems to always get 30% off the lowest rate or prtty cheap anyways... warthunder2k Jan 20th, 2008, 10:38 AM Yes you are right I forgot about this one. You can ask for corporate rate it&apos;s just a little more money than gov employee. Plus it&apos;s easy to get.

I&apos;ve always refused to pay full price at a hotel ~ but then again, I&apos;m a government employee. However, so far I&apos;ve used my&quot;discount&quot;at 3 hotels and each one of them requested proof that I worked for the federal government.

I brought along a paystub and my ID card and that was good enough. miss_swan Jan 20th, 2008, 01:45 PM A friend of mine found out that if you score too high on the intelligence tests when screening to become a cop (in Edmonton), you fail selection. Certainly doesn&apos;t surprise me.

They don&apos;t want you too&quot;intelligent&quot;because you&apos;re less likely to conform to training and keep adherence over the long run. They want minimal risks, max benefit.

Plus, people who score&quot;well&quot;on intelligence tests may not have characteristics that translate well into policing.

Some people are just good at taking intelligence tests and do not actually translate those scores into what we&apos;d consider a productive life.

Does that still apply now that IBM and PriceWaterhouse Coopers merged and are now under the IBM banner?

I used to work in the Price Waterhouse office for market research and now it is something like IBM business services.

speaking of those consulting companies. Andersen consulting- the company that had sketchy problems a few years ago, they renamed themselves Accenture.

Dustbunny Jan 22nd, 2008, 03:38 AM A friend of mine found out that if you score too high on the intelligence tests when screening to become a cop (in Edmonton), you fail selection. Certainly doesn&apos;t surprise me.

There is another factor here that companies often use those tests to determine and that is whether the person is suited to what might be considered repetitive or boring work (cashier is a good example where that comes into play). Rather than them rejecting based on the IQ it&apos;s more on the fact that they did all the questions in order. Those tests are set up so math, perception, logic, etc. are all mixed up and you have to shift gears pretty well to answer the questions in order. When they see someone went through and did all the math first for instance then they have someone who likes to concentrate on one thing at a time or is less likely to get bored doing repetitive work. Different organizations may be looking at the tests for different reasons than overall IQ.

Whether what happens in Edt. is based on IQ or not I don&apos;t know. I do know being a patrol officer is regarded as one of the most boring and mind numbing jobs going sometimes so they need people who can cope with that yet stay alert. So not to say it has to do with intellegence, just more of personality trait requirement.

If you are ever asked to take an IQ test or any other type of test figure out what they might be looking for before you take the test if you want the job.

Winners hires a company to randomly go to some of their stores and check if the salespeople will sell you items without tags- they are not allowed to sell those apparently it is in the employee manual.

Also you (well I had to) check the fitting rooms for price tags that would be shoved between the small cracks as that is a sign of theft,

Also in Winners manual it says to consider anyone a potential for theft and that the staff should not leave the customers alone for long.

Now I don&apos;t work for winners I just had to go visit the different stores in my city.:lol:

I also knew a girl I went to school with apparently she would wear pants she did not like as much to the store and would switch into new pants at the change room- not sure how often she did this as she was not a good friend (no idea why?? she bragged of this either?) canabiz Feb 24th, 2008, 10:19 AM Winners hires a company to randomly go to some of their stores and check if the salespeople will sell you items without tags- they are not allowed to sell those apparently it is in the employee manual.

I have heard stories about people switching tags at Winners (and at other shops mind you), i.e. slapping a $19.99 tag on a $59.99 jeans for example.

The cashiers would just swipe the tag (and that&apos;s their job, precisely, i don&apos;t think they have time to wonder oh why you got such a great deal on this) and the *customers* got a nice $40 discount, now whether there is any collusion between the cashiers and the customers (wouldn&apos;t surprise me) remains to be seen, but my point is they need to have a better system in place, if they don&apos;t want to be ripped off. canabiz Feb 24th, 2008, 10:23 AM I&apos;ve always refused to pay full price at a hotel ~ but then again, I&apos;m a government employee. However, so far I&apos;ve used my&quot;discount&quot;at 3 hotels and each one of them requested proof that I worked for the federal government.

I brought along a paystub and my ID card and that was good enough.

Does it have to be business-related or government-sponsored trips ? Also, i would imagine it will work only within Canada ?

In my experience they don&apos;t care...

I work in the construction business and learnt these things:

1. You get tetanus shots, so when a nail goes through you, you are protected.

2. If there was a house with a leaky roof we would not&quot;patch it&quot;but purposely tore the entire roof off to bag more money, sometimes making extra holes on purpose to show the home owner.

3. The same went for basement waterproofing. We also made sure to use as much as needless material to surcharge homeowners, we got a commission from suppliers for extra material bought (at the expense of the house owner).

4. Most of all the land for 50 kilometers around Toronto has already been bought by Toronto&apos;s largest house-building corporations.

5. To build a $400,000 home in Toronto only costs $130,000 to build.

6. Most supplies to build homes and waterproof basements are strictly controlled and you cannot buy them unless you have a Toronto city permit... and the purpose of that permit is to tax you for any underground work you might try to do. So if you waterproof a basement and want to hide it from Canada Revenue you won&apos;t get away with it because a hefty tax is already charged in the construction products.

7. We used to bribe the local unions to give us contracts, especially city contracts. So projects were not given to the cheapest bidder or most professional, but to whoever gave the biggest kickback.

8. We installed cheap illegal wiring in new homes to save money on the real thing, we also sometimes did not insulate homes properly to make a few extra $$$ thousands per house... who will find out that their new house only has 70% of the insulation it&apos;s supposed to have?

9. We bribed city inspectors to pass minor and mild shoddy jobs in new homes and road-building.

I wasn&apos;t going to post this one but eff it, I&apos;ve kinda had enough ...
Shoppers Drug Mart doesn&apos;t recycle CRAP at any of its stores. Flyers go to each store every week at about Tuesday/Wednesday in a small box (at least 1) with hundreds of flyers.

If a flyer is wrinkled, wet or not clean looking, its thrown in the garbage.
All the old flyers left over are thrown in the garbage.
Flyers left in carts, thrown in the garbage.

Not a single piece of paper is recycled anywhere ... 1,000 Stores strong it REALLY bugs me that they don&apos;t care at all about this.
Not to mention daily reports printed by multiple people in multiple departments, every single day.

Because they do this on a regular basis, every week, with so many stores, I think they&apos;re the largest polluter I can think of. Larger than FS or BB, larger than grocery stores even. Valek Apr 8th, 2008, 01:19 AM Marketing and Market Research: Focus Groups

So I&apos;m not sure how many of you participate in Focus Groups, but if you do, or hope to be put into one for the future, here&apos;s some helpful info to I guess, be placed in the proper demographic that the company is looking for:
Most cases you&apos;ll be asked a series of questions to see if you fit a certain quota to be filled. Here are some questioins that will disqualify you.

1) If you&apos;ve work or have ever worked in:
Marketing and Market Research
Advertising
A Member of ACTRA
Any Media company
Public Relations
Etc, basically any occupation the interviewer asks you, they are making sure that YOU DO NOT work for one of these companies as you&apos;ll be automatically disqualified. They&apos;ll think you might have special access to information.

2) For placement purposes, do you mind if I have you household income/year? Total, not including investible assets such as houses or cars, etc.
-Yes, a sensitive questioin to many but to the companies trying to market something, this question is a big one. Many people will not qualify because they refuse to give out any information like this. Approximate ranges are allowed however:&quot;20-40k, 41-70k, etc. Usually though, there&apos;s a big fat DISQUALIFY beside the&lt;20k range though.

3) Some Focus Groups pay so well it&apos;s crazy. This one Focus Group was looking for certain car owners. If the car owner agreed to particpate in the group, here&apos;s what the incentive was:
Round trip air fare from Toronto to Las Vegas for yourself + your partner
Hotel and Food included
Transportation to and from Airport/Hotel included
An exclusive auto show only for the focus group to check out new concept models
Sight seeing tour for the Focus Group respondents
3 Nights later: Trip home.
All that, plus cash.

Medical focus groups are also high paying, doctors and health specialists get paid anywhere from $250/15 min and upwards for their time to discuss something over the telephone. WAY more if they come in to the office in person and participate in a 1 on 1 study.

I know of a few from Silver City.

People there used to clean their hands with the sheets of ice, and then put it back into the machine cooler which was used directly in peoples drinks.
I have seen people 1) hork in those machines 2) put those giant june bug beatles in there

The ends of the pop tank machines were never ever cleaned. It would be covered with sticky pop syrup and insane amounts of black dirt / dust / crud. This would all make it into peoples drinks.

We had problems with fruit flies back at the pretzel place and same with the new york fries. The bugs would lay their eggs in the dough and in the potato&apos;s. Nothing was ever done about it - but the fly eggs were instantly killed when they went in the oven/deep frier.

The Burger King at silver city would constantly use expired buns as long as their wasn&apos;t mould on it.

During the movie the Blair Witch Project, people used to barf all over the seats like crazy. We would just throw some pop corn on it, sweep it up with our broom, then put this chemical on top of it to hide the smell. No anti-bacterial spray was ever used.

We had severe rat/field mice problems underneath the building. Silver City is actually a&quot;floating strcuture&quot;that doesn&apos;t have a basement. We once went under the false floor to see what was there, turned our flash light on, and saw 100&apos;s of field mice and rats scurry away. Probably one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen.

The&quot;popcorn powders&quot;also had issues with them. Workers would constantly use the&quot;all purpose cleaning chemical&quot;around them which would of course get into the powder that people would sprinkle/season their popcorn with.

I think issues like that need to be reported to the head office to be investigated further. You may BELIEVE the head office just&quot;knows about it&quot;and big business doesn&apos;t care but that&apos;s truly a health scare problem and a newspaper article away from exposure, so the CEO might be interested.

Likestuff4free Apr 13th, 2008, 01:19 AM A Wal-mart warehouse in NE Calgary has 7 skids of Wii&apos;s which was recieved on feb 6 with bright orange stickers that say not to be displayed until june 22, 2008 and behind a chain link fence jadoocian Apr 13th, 2008, 03:04 AM not much of a secret but:

At the CN tower, people come in paying 25-40$ ticket expecting something amazing to do and see at the top. You usually just end up going to the top, look around for an hour (trying to convince yourself it was worth the money) and come back down. There is NOTHING to do up there other then look around - which might be all you wanted to do anyway.

One exception is if you want to eat. If you have more money to blow on yourself and friends, by all means, check out the restaurants there.

DO NOT go on an amazing summer day as you will wait up to 2 hours in line for literally looking around and come back down in like half hour. If you must go on this day, go early morning or closer to closing.

if you&apos;re good at slipping through those ropes to keep lines in place, you can easily sneak up there without a problem.

One last good one- your ticket expires once it has been scanned and you are let through. As you&apos;re going up the elevator, read the employees name tag (or ask them what it is if they don&apos;t have one - the ones that don&apos;t have one are hiding it as you MUST be wearing a name tag at all times).

If you wish to exit the tower and come back later that day (or perhaps let someone else go up for free ), take your expired ticket and write with a pen

&quot;30 - xxxxx. Allow rentry for yyyyy&quot;. where it says xxxxx, just write their name, where it says yyyyy, write todays&apos; date. You should be able to use this ticket again. Just say persson xxxxx allowed you to come back if they question you (which they won&apos;t)

The only thng you gotta be careful of is that the person who&apos;s name you write, isn&apos;t collecting tickets the second time you come in, otherwise they will obviously remember they didnt write that! Basically sometimes the employees are nice and make exceptions for you to go back down (cuz u forgot camera or baby in your car). Here you are just doing what they woulda done for you ;)

The number&quot;30&quot;in there is just a department code. (ie to tell the difference between security, restaurant workers, customer service ppl etc) Easy as pie, if you do it, post back with results!!! billdozer Apr 13th, 2008, 03:18 AM The only thng you gotta be careful of is that the person who&apos;s name you write, isn&apos;t collecting tickets the second time you come in, otherwise they will obviously remember they didnt write that!

Kuurgen Apr 13th, 2008, 05:17 AM I used to work at a banquet hall and the parmasan on the tables (which were sitting out all night during the party in small bowls) were dumped into a larger bowl then re-used until finished. Bread was also the same, it would be put in large garbage bags and re-used for Sunday&apos;s lunches.

Oh, so was wine--bottles would be filled with other bottles until they were full again and then re-corked for re-use. When going to banquet halls or retaurants, make sure the wine is not only corked, but SEALED, too.

This brought back memories of one of my first ever jobs at a banquet hall.
Rebottling the wine and grabbing and rebagging rolls.

Pet Psychcic (my favorite).
Calls used to come to my house. I only really did it for about a day, but everybody got the same schpiel. Basically, it was paid by the hour you had someone on the phone, so I was trying to keep people on as long as I could. If I remembe correctly, I got paid $15 an hour.

Also, I was one of those a**holes that would interupt you in the mall food court, or at school or something and try to sell you a beauty salon package or paintball or something. The beauty salon one was for like 8 visits. I sold them for $40 and got to keep $20. There were some people that were selling like 20 -30 packages a day. If you bought a package, you had to use them in order, and within a certain time frame. I heard several people tell me that the &apos;saloons&apos; tended to go out of business very quickly. Did that one for a day too. It felt super sketchy. jnfr Apr 18th, 2008, 12:26 PM Well...though this is a good start., what I&apos;d REALLY like to learn, is:

At Staples:
1)Where do I look for hidden stock
2)If the rep is having a problem processing a pm., how do i navigate the menus to faclitate the process over-riding key authorization only steps :D

Same questions to FS.BB., etc :lol:

&quot;Hidden&quot;stock is usually placed above where the item&apos;s home location is. There&apos;s like 2&quot;levels&quot;of stock that items are placed in before they reach the shelves. There&apos;s usually no&quot;hidden&quot;stock at the&quot;Back&quot;(hell, the&quot;back&quot;doesn&apos;t even exist at the Staples I worked at. All there is at the back is defective items, overstock and discontinued products.) Just ask a friendly associate and they will check if there are more of the product you are looking for in the system, but usually the aisle associates will be checking the shelves to make sure everything is stocked properly.

Why would a rep have a problem processing a PM? Customers are obviously not allowed to go behind the counter and key in their own codes. :P


Oh and most of the time when customers bring in items for return and the package has been opened, the associates do a crap job making sure the box contains everything needed and there is almost never any testing to make sure the product works fine. We just tape it up, put a&quot;Repacked!&quot;sticker on it and sell it at the same price. convoluted Apr 18th, 2008, 01:27 PM &quot;Hidden&quot;stock is usually placed above where the item&apos;s home location is.

I think bubble.tea is talking about stock that is&quot;pulled from the shelves&quot;when a ridiculous PM opportunity begins. Much more valid in the past when they had 150% PMs... Such as say&quot;free&quot;items because staples is selling at $120 and competitor is selling at $40. The stock&quot;mysteriously&quot;disappears.

And often, because reps do not process PMs frequently, or are new, they do not know how to key them in. jnfr Apr 18th, 2008, 01:50 PM I think bubble.tea is talking about stock that is&quot;pulled from the shelves&quot;when a ridiculous PM opportunity begins.

Oh, okay.

Well anyways, if like, 2 huge PM&apos;S came in, my manager would freak out and hide all the other one and instruct associates to let them know that we&apos;re sold out or holding them. There&apos;s no way to bypass it really, just go in early :D Oh, and flyer days are on Tuesday. The features table usually changes Monday nights so you can get a sneak preview at the items on sale. If it&apos;s a hot item, buy it Monday night, come back Tuesday and do a PM.

Also, Staples shouldn&apos;t be pricematching Dell or Canada Computers or Infonec, etc etc but if you get rejected once, try again at another location. Go when it&apos;s busy (Saturdays!!) and you see a nervous teenage clerk behind the CS desk. Most likely, they&apos;ll let you have it. This only applies for items less than $50!!! If the item is over $50 and changes to the price is made, manager&apos;s approval is needed....... (this goes for returns as well)

Oh, and if you want to buy a laptop or something else expensive, get one on a weekday night (Friday nights...) when it&apos;s REALLY dead. Managers are really pumped on selling x number of laptops/computers and making y amount of money by the end of each business day so if you go when it&apos;s really quiet and dead and they need to reach their quota, you can bargain like crazy and they&apos;ll probably throw in an ESP because they are desperate for them.

If you have an ESP and you want to claim it, make sure that it&apos;s been over one year from your purchase date (or past the manufacturer&apos;s warranty) but SOMETIMES we will let this slide if it is just a replacement plan. Also, you must get a CASE NUMBER from the ESP call center (obtain number from ESP form) before we will even begin to listen to you. We will probably not call the call centre for you and if you come in on a weekend, we will tell you to come back on Monday because call center is closed on weekends***************!!!!!!!!!

Rebottling the wine and grabbing and rebagging rolls.


Good times!


This must be in the restauraunt and hospitality handbook!

Lol,
whenever my Stepfather orders wine he insists the bottle be opened in front of him.
And also quite a few times he can even tell if it is the wrong wine or mixed as he is pretty much a wine expert.

Once he made a waiter replace his wine glass 3 times as the wine was off.
Don&apos;t think the emplyee was too happy bout that though.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here&apos;s my phone tips:

Well I know if you go to the Telephone Booth store or a store that has pay as you go phones, the Sales Associates are supposed to reccomend Fido as the first choice for prepaid and the salespeople make more on that.

Also for regular service most of the stores are supposed to reccomend the Rogers brand with a 3 year contract and the big thing is to try and tell you you have a $100 extra rebate if you sign up for the vision service.

What they forget to tell you is that the Vision services is for the duration of the contract and is $7 a month and if you cancel it there is a penalty and you lose the $100 credit! warthunder2k Apr 19th, 2008, 10:48 AM What they forget to tell you is that the Vision services is for the duration of the contract and is $7 a month and if you cancel it there is a penalty and you lose the $100 credit!

When you buy gas at an Esso station, and pay the attendant in cash, if you don&apos;t have an Esso points card, they can swipe their own and collect the points.

As long as the attendant doesn&apos;t get dumb about it (ie. swiping their card 20 times in a shift), they can rack up alot of free points. canabiz Apr 19th, 2008, 11:24 AM This is from a few years back now, but it might still be valid.

Shouldn&apos;t it be the same for any other cards (Petro, Shell etc)? Ebola Apr 19th, 2008, 11:48 AM Shouldn&apos;t it be the same for any other cards (Petro, Shell etc)?

I assume so. A buddy of mine (this was back in high school) worked at Esso, and that&apos;s what he told me.

I&apos;m guessing their are loopholes everywhere. Digital_Domain Apr 19th, 2008, 11:48 AM Last summer, the pool I worked at had it&apos;s maintenance guy leave, leaving my supervisor in charge of maintaining the pool. He had never maintained a pool before and barely knew how to do the standard pool tests. Thus, our pool became legally unsafe to operate. At one point, our pH became a skin burning 8.1 (legally, pH should be&lt;7.9) and our chlorine levels went anywhere from 1ppm up to an eye burning 8ppm (it went up to 12ppm on a Sunday, but I didn&apos;t work then). We talked to higher ups and not much was really done, so I quit after the summer. Oh, if you&apos;re saying that I should have reported that, they must maintain 3-hour logs that must be kept for a year (legal requirement), health inspectors can easily find out this information when they next check the pool out.

Many places do that. Like Fido activation places.

Their coffee is made fresh. Every 20 minutes we have to dump it. That&apos;s why pots have time written in white marker. However, this is often NOT the case on slow times, mostly noon at weekends.

Contrary to what you may believe, it&apos;s quite clean. Other than ice cap. They use tap water to make the java. The machine that freezes the java to ice cap is really of poor design. It fails to freeze it fast enough on hot days or when you use too much and too fast of the java, leading to watery ice caps. Bacon are all microwaved from semi-cooked.

What surprises me is how everything can be returned. If you don&apos;t like the way your coffee is made, you can exchange it. Or, if they got the wrong cream cheese, put lettuce when you didn&apos;t want lettuce... etc. Usually, they will do it because they don&apos;t like you holding back the other customers, and they don&apos;t want you to complain to head office.


I think that&apos;s all. Well, once, when someone was making chicken salad (which is made on-site) they dropped some on the table but put it back in. I guess that was one of the worse offenses. T-Man May 24th, 2008, 02:11 AM Ok, here are some myths and facts from one of my jobs:

1) Hospital E.R Room wait times too long? Don&apos;t want to wait for hours? No, problem, call an ambulance, they can bypass the E.R wait times, and&quot;get in right away&quot;


Although I&apos;ve seen people who come in and I can pretty much tell if they really need to be seen right away, I&apos;ll do my best to alert the Charge Nurse(bypassing the busy occupied Triage Nurse), and on the other hand, I&apos;ve seen people flood the the E.R rooms with minor things (my opinion) such as sore throat, a cold, a headache, a slight fever etc.... What makes me shake my head is when this second group of people use our tax funded ambulance services....

Fact:
Once you arrive by ambulance, you&apos;re taken into the ambulance hallway, where a nurse will Triage you, same as walking into the E.R doors yourself. Hospitals will take the most serious life threatening people first, doesn&apos;t matter how you arrived. I&apos;ve seen people brought in by ambulances, and after being triage, they stay laying on the stretcher in the hallway. It then gets crowded, and ambulance vehicles get piled up in and around the ambulance bay outside. Paramedics, by law are not allowed to just leave you there as they have not officially released you to the hospital staff yet. So what happens, they then read magazines, play chess, talk about the hockey game last night etc. Oh don&apos;t worry, they&apos;re still supervising you while you&apos;re laying there. They also get paid by the hour. Paramedics always work in a team of two, so thats two publicly funded workers that are now tied down not too mentioned one less ambulance now on the road to respond to a real emergency. The ambulance ride cost itself? Thats paid by our tax dollars as well, unless the busy E.R doctor remembers to fill out this form that states the ambulance ride was unnecessary in which case the bill would be charge back to the patient.

I once saw a guy arrives by ambulance, and after being triage, he then demanded a room right away, none was available at the moment, the Nurse replied due to his not urgent nature, it may be a few hours before he gets a room. Guess what he did next, he jumps off the ambulance stretcher, rushes past the confused paramedics and states&quot;Fine, I&quot;m going home then&quot;and leaves out the E.R doors. RenegadeX May 24th, 2008, 02:24 AM [cops..] They promote internally. Do are you saying all the senior officers are the smarter ones out of all the *****?The way it works for most of the positions cops can apply to internally is that every so often for whatever reason, they&apos;ll make &apos;x&apos; number of openings available. If a cop has the necessary qualifications for the position and they get approval from their sergeant or superintendent to apply for the job, they can proceed with the application. (However, there is often a pecking-order based on badge-# seniority within the detachment, so they may not get the green-light to apply for the position when it&apos;s first available). If more people apply than positions available, then the best candidate(s) theoretically get selected; however, if there are 5 positions and only 4 applicants, or 2 positions and 1 applicant, the applicant is guaranteed the position unless they do something majorly wrong during the interview process or during training.

It is for this reason why there are some cops that really *shouldn&apos;t* be in the position they&apos;re in.

And depending on the unit/department, an officer may be able to apply and re-apply for the same position indefinitely, though they may be told not to reapply for a certain time-period (such as 6-months from their last attempt). Having said that, special units like ERU frequently tell officers after their 2nd failed attempt,&quot;Please don&apos;t bother applying again&quot;. :lol: Kasakato May 24th, 2008, 02:26 AM I worked at Tim Hortons.

Are foods being wasted in Hospital and (city owned) Nursing Homes?

Some of the ones that I&apos;ve been in yes. I&apos;ve seen perfectly good trays of frozen Lasagna being toss in the garburator or other perfectly good foods being thrown out on a daily basis. a) Why not give it to the homeless shelter? An answer I was given was that in case somebody decides to turn around and sue the hospital for say food poisoning. b) Why not let the staff have the left overs then? I think its cause they don&apos;t want the staff to take advantage of this. I was in a Home once, where staff were allowed to purchase a plate of leftover foods for $1. That money was then used to buy stuff for the residents on that unit/floor. But somebody higher up thought it was a bad idea so the program was scrapped. c) Why not save it for leftovers or at least one more day? They can&apos;t no room, another shipment is coming in and they need the space.

Fact:

Each year, government own Nursing Homes, and Hospitals are given X number of dollars, so lets say Grace Hospital ABC gets 1.4million a year as their budget for just food. But say in reality they only need 1.1 million, so thats about $300,000 wasted. Now Grace Hospital ABC decides to save money and that they can operate on a budget of 1.1 mill, so thats what they apply for and get for the following year, but then say a year after that, due to population growth etc, they now find themselves needing 1.4 mill, are they likely to get it again? Probably not. So hospitals will not risk it.

One of my former co-worker who&apos;s wife works for the government runs an office and faced the same dilemna. She would be given a certain budget every year, and she has to spend it all otherwise, she&apos;ll be cut back. So every year she gets new office furniture, blinds, computers, chairs etc.... T-Man May 24th, 2008, 03:01 AM I see this get asked a lot at the hospital:

3)How many Ambulances does this hospital have?

Answer= 0

If you&apos;re a paramedic, you&apos;re not employed by the hospital, You&apos;re paid directly by the city/government. Peel Regional Services, or Toronto EMS etc will normally take you to the nearest properly equipped hospital for your specific needs.


4) How come hospital foods are boring? Plain? no flavour?

Fact:
I think hospital foods have improved over the years. They are just not loaded with stuff you&apos;re used too like Sodium AKA. Salt, fats, preservatives, More and more of the food you eat in hospitals are more prepared daily, so you don&apos;t get as much processed food as you used to. So basically its healthier and better for the patients and everybody. I can&apos;t speak for smaller hospitals, but I&apos;ve see bigger hospital&apos;s chef/cook/baker would bake croissants, and other goodies on site.

I&apos;ve seen that first hand. extra $$$ in the budget? new desks, carpet, lighting, desk accessories, etc. i watched them throw out perfectly good everything. stationary items (paper trays, pen holders w/ pens in them, gel wrist pads) went right into the garbage cause they were getting new ones anyways. i even got to help choose the new carpet. rfdrfd May 24th, 2008, 10:56 AM And also that OHIP only pays for your Ambulance transport if your condition is a medical emergency. If not, you will get billed later. So calling an Ambulance just to get in there faster doesn&apos;t work in all circumstances (and as you pointed out, it depends on the severity of your emergency as well)

There are certain (limited) exemptions to the $45 fee. (eg - on welfare, living in a Ministry approved nursing home/rest home)

Otherwise, even if the doctor says it&apos;s medically necessary, there&apos;s still a $45 fee, but that&apos;s good your family member didn&apos;t have to pay. A lot of people don&apos;t know about the ambulance fee and are surprised to get a bill. My grandmother was quite surprised after my grandfather had a stroke at home and was taken to the hospital by ambulance as he couldn&apos;t move and she was unable to carry him to her car. She received the bill in the mail from the hospital 2 days after he had passed away. That was when I became aware of the charge.

- the short answer is: it depends.

Issues of apathy, liability, policy derivation and/or lack of it, culture of administration ... all that stuff and more.

Yes, there is always huge waste of food at most if not all facilities to a large degree. Food gets thrown out for good reasons ... food also gets thrown out because many times the effort, insight or foresight and/or political will are not there to enact change. They aren&apos;t going to hold onto food to&quot;sell&quot;to employees unless the typically have an employee ordering program ... it&apos;s much&quot;simpler&quot;to chuck out food.

Food that gets put out on the floor and comes back gets chucked out per foodsafe policy ... that&apos;s a no brainer even though it comes across as extremely wasteful (it is). Life is not black and white ...

As with budgets, especially governmental-types, if you don&apos;t use your budget you lose it. If you save 200k then all that happens is someone to (maybe) give you a pat on the back and then cut your budget by 200k the next year. There are not many medals given out for taking one for the team ... you might as well utilize those funds to increase morale or to increase an employees ability to do their jobs or to enjoy their jobs to maintain loyalty and decrease sick time and inefficiencies.

... and no, i&apos;m not an administrator. :) rilhouse May 25th, 2008, 03:33 PM OK another one:

Are foods being wasted in Hospital and (city owned) Nursing Homes?

Some of the ones that I&apos;ve been in yes. I&apos;ve seen perfectly good trays of frozen Lasagna being toss in the garburator or other perfectly good foods being thrown out on a daily basis. a) Why not give it to the homeless shelter? An answer I was given was that in case somebody decides to turn around and sue the hospital for say food poisoning. b) Why not let the staff have the left overs then? I think its cause they don&apos;t want the staff to take advantage of this. I was in a Home once, where staff were allowed to purchase a plate of leftover foods for $1. That money was then used to buy stuff for the residents on that unit/floor. But somebody higher up thought it was a bad idea so the program was scrapped. c) Why not save it for leftovers or at least one more day? They can&apos;t no room, another shipment is coming in and they need the space.

Fact:

Each year, government own Nursing Homes, and Hospitals are given X number of dollars, so lets say Grace Hospital ABC gets 1.4million a year as their budget for just food. But say in reality they only need 1.1 million, so thats about $300,000 wasted. Now Grace Hospital ABC decides to save money and that they can operate on a budget of 1.1 mill, so thats what they apply for and get for the following year, but then say a year after that, due to population growth etc, they now find themselves needing 1.4 mill, are they likely to get it again? Probably not. So hospitals will not risk it.

One of my former co-worker who&apos;s wife works for the government runs an office and faced the same dilemna. She would be given a certain budget every year, and she has to spend it all otherwise, she&apos;ll be cut back. So every year she gets new office furniture, blinds, computers, chairs etc....

yah i used to work in a hospital (in IT) and towards the end of the fiscal year was like a crazy shopping spree, much of the equipment was never used. it&apos;s really disgusting but true, if they don&apos;t spend the $, it&apos;s less next year. our tax dollars hard at work!

Unfortunately, it&apos;s like that with corporations too. At the end of the year, it always shopping spree time.Too bad it&apos;s never for our salaries. :(
I know for business, if you don&apos;t spend the money you&apos;ll just get dinged for hefty taxes (37%) so it is always to spend it better than to give it to the government. batman321123 May 25th, 2008, 04:21 PM Fact:

Old people talk about you behind your back more than teenagers do. Did some volunteer work at a hospital gift shop back in the day, and some of the things they said once the customer left was astonishing. Of course, I just had to sit there and nod my head as if I was interested.

Don&apos;t mess with your electrician or else it&apos;ll be lights out for you... trilinearmipmap May 25th, 2008, 04:33 PM OK I have a few...

Job #1, summer student job at an oil refinery.

Part of my job was testing fuel samples in a lab. Heated different grades of fuel, measured the temperature they evaporated at, measured the temperature a spark would ignite them at. Then report by phone or radio to the guys working in the control areas, basically if the fuel was too light or too heavy they would make adjustments to bring it back into specifications. Anyway, if the jet fuel or gas was out of the specified range, instead of adjusting their equipment to correct the problem, they would put pressure on me to fudge the results of the lab tests, I must have made a testing error, wasn&apos;t the number realy xxxx instead of yyyy.

Another part of the job was patrolling the grounds in a pickup truck to measure volumes in all the tanks. One time around midnight I found a small (small meaning several thousand gallons) tank of fuel was overflowing. I radioed back&quot;tank number xxx is over the top&quot;. Later I got crap for this because the supervisor hears the radio calls, they guys expected me instead to have discretely notified them of the overflow so the supervisor wouldn&apos;t find out. No one seemed to care that fuel spilled into the harbour and no one notified any gov&apos;t or environmental authorities.

Anyway I suppose this is one reason I don&apos;t hold unions in the highest esteem, working with these lazy union bums really opened my eyes. trilinearmipmap May 25th, 2008, 04:40 PM OK, job #2 was a summer student job working as a research assistant at a biology lab at a university.

There were about five post-doctoral types working there, all hoping to land a job as a professor. The professor who they all worked under sat in her office and did nothing all day. Her underlings would do all the research work, then when it was published her name would go on it as the researcher, and I am not sure if they even got credit for&quot;assisting her&quot;.

I worked on collecting data for a couple of&quot;experiments&quot;if you could call them that. They way it is supposed to work is you make a hypothesis, set up an experiment, collect the data, run statistics on the data and see if it supports or refutes your hypothesis. The way it really worked is if your data doesn&apos;t support the experimental hypothesis, you must have made a mistake in your data collection, you throw that data out and try again until you get data that is&quot;correct&quot;.

There were 5 of these grad student/post-doc types all competing for a position as a professor, eventually one got hired. For political correctness reasons the female got hired even though she was the least competent of an incompetent lot. In any event I took the summer job just to prove to myself that I really really did not want to go into academic research for a career, I thing the job convinced me I was correct about that. monty613 May 25th, 2008, 04:52 PM No one seemed to care that fuel spilled into the harbour and no one notified any gov&apos;t or environmental authorities.


wtf! trilinearmipmap May 25th, 2008, 04:54 PM OK job #3 is my current job which I will just say is in the health care area.

Some tidbits about doctors. Too many people assume that doctors are to be looked up to and they are honest, respectable etc. etc. Some are but too many are not. For example, there are quite a number of docs out there who will be glad to prescribe narcotics to drug addicts. The doc doesn&apos;t care if they are harming someone with an addiction problem. Every patient seen is another thirty bucks in the doc&apos;s pocket. Similarly there are huge numbers of&quot;disabled&quot;people out there who are perfectly healthy but have imaginary or over-exaggerated medical conditions. They will go to doc A, B, C, and D until they find the one unethical doc who will certify them as&quot;disabled&quot;so they can collect benefits.

Hospital admin is not much better. At one hospital I worked at a window was leaking. You would imagine it might cost two or three hundred dollars to replace. No, the one leaking window meant the whole exterior of the building had to be re-done for approximately one million dollars. Something about if we don&apos;t spend the money in our capital maintenance budget we will lose that money next year. Similarly, back in the days when computers cost around three thousand dollars, a decision was made to buy a computer for docs to use in one room, even though it was made abundantly clear that no one would actually use that computer. If we didn&apos;t spend our budget, the budget would decrease next year. The computer was purchased and sat gathering dust in a room that no one went into.

Once a doc is on staff at a hospital it is almost impossible to get rid of him. We had one specialist who everyone knew was incompetent, no matter what we did we could not get rid of him, and as long as he was there no one else could be recruited to take his place. Finally thank God he left.

As far as nursing goes, there are good ones and bad ones. The scam is, the best, smartest, hardest working and caring nurse will be paid on the same pay scale as the incompetent, lazy and undependable nurse. In private industry nurse A would get a promotion and a raise (I hope) and nurse B would be disciplined or fired.

There is a lot of abuse of the system by patients. People going to ER for a sore throat (approx $300.00 expense to the system) when a $30.00 office visit would accomplish the same thing. People claiming fake WCB injuries. It seems that there is a good percentage of the population who live their lives by scamming the system. manixc May 25th, 2008, 04:57 PM OK, job #2 was a summer student job working as a research assistant at a biology lab at a university.

Yeah, I did coop for a physics research group and decided not to go into academic research.

Depends on the project, I do believe the lead professor get their name at the front and then followed by other profs and post-docs. Being post-docs do suck (I&apos;ve met a few), basically they are trying to gain a reputation (writing papers and etc) and hopefully be a professor.

Still, you gotta respect their dedications to the subject.

BlueMax May 25th, 2008, 07:03 PM People claiming fake WCB injuries. It seems that there is a good percentage of the population who live their lives by scamming the system.
My pot-head brother in law was like that. Would work only long enough to claim some sort of disability, then would&quot;injure&quot;himself. Step on a roll of tape... bump into a wall and [insert sad violins]&quot;OOhhhhhhh.... I&apos;m so injured!!&quot;How he managed to ever get a doctor to support his claim that he was badly injured is beyond me.

On the plus side, he&apos;s been blacklisted so cannot abuse the system any longer. :) twistedmuse May 25th, 2008, 10:22 PM - KFC chicken when packed in a bucket or barrel is supposed to be half white meat. A 15 piece bucket should have 8 pieces of dark and 7 pieces of white meat (and yes a wing is considered white meat). There is a sur charge to upgrade any piece of dark meat to white.

- always check your ice in your drink at a restaurant. If the cube is cloudy and not see-through; the ice machine is in a sorry state and needs cleaning. A study was done a few years ago and the results showed that there is less bacteria in a freshly flushed toilet as opposed to the ice in most fast food restaurants. Health conscious people also ask for no ice....not just people looking for more soda

- microwaved pickle slices at McD&apos;s make the BEST projectile to fling at the flesh of people that annoy you... they stick ~evil grin~

- popcorn sold at auditoriums is mostly popped the day before to keep up with the volume. A little bit is popped during the event for visual effect and the smell to entice sales.

- the majority of food served at Red Lobster is doused in a butter and wine mixture called scampi sauce. The wine is barely perceptable in taste. If you order for example your garlic shrimp with NO wine (say it&apos;s a religious thing...or even i&apos;m in AA you wanna argue about it?) and your order will be made fresh to order every time.

- if you ask for unsalted french fries at McD&apos;s they will have to make you fresh ones as they are all salted. Then you can ask for salt packets.

- the Suite entrance at the Aud is where all food services staff also enter for their shift ~hint hint~

There was no oil to change out the fryer so I planned on not using that particular vat as my manager would not let me dump it. The same manager threw some fries down in that fryer while helping at lunch. Ewww. The same manager was served their fish and chips for their lunch cooked in the same fryer. :cheesygri RenegadeX May 26th, 2008, 01:05 AM The other beaver is this guy

Ken Hudson CampbellHoly crap. I was actually wrong about something... for the FIRST TIME EVER!!! :-0

Thanks for the info! jeremycoburn May 26th, 2008, 02:19 PM I used to work for a sewer flushing company (Trans Video out of Oshawa). We ran the big noisey old water trucks that woke you up early in the morning and sometimes turned your toilets into sprinklers because of the pure back pressure they produce. (we called this the old Porcelin Enima).

One day while working in Richmond Hill we found ourselves with a bit of a delema. We had just finished flushing a line when we decided to run our camera through to ensure the line was indeed clean and there was no damage.

This line was at the end of a long line of residential streets and the camera noticed light in a tunnel that shouldn&apos;t be there. We proceeded to check to see where the light was coming from only to find our camera crawling over a toilet paper and tampon pile and looking accross the lenth of a pond at kids swimming and familys enjoying there day on the public beach.

Yes my friends, Richmond Hill some how combined the sanitary and storm lines and now all the sanitary waste was disposed of in a public swimming hole.

This is going back 10 years ago and the problem was fixed right away, however there is no way of knowing how long the lines were crossed; this issue was kept on the down low and never made public; the swimming hole was never closed and all repair work was done at night while everyone was tucked snug in there beds dreaming of tomorrows day at the beach.

Nobody was any the wiser..... until now. Blunt May 26th, 2008, 02:23 PM :arrowu: Wow!
Gross jeremycoburn May 26th, 2008, 03:18 PM I dont know this through experience, but I was told this:

That one is definently not true for the SilverCity I worked at . . . they cleaned the popping machines every night and we had to pop fresh popcorn everyday.

I didn&apos;t mention a thing about movie theaters...I said auditoriums. And the machines were cleaned out there nightly also. The popcorn was popped 24 hours in advance and bagged in huge garbage bags and stored in crawl spaces (commonly called ratholes for obvious reasons)and put back into the warming bin to sell just before an event. cyrene May 26th, 2008, 06:01 PM I&apos;m sure many know about the shopping sprees at the federal government, but I didn&apos;t know hospitals do that, too, until I read a few threads regarding their spending!

This isn&apos;t all that uncommon. It takes decent effort to find someone who wants old office crap and the coordinate the move. A private entity might be motivated to improve its image a bit, but a public dept just wants it out of the way hence employees taking it, or going to some random empty room. It can be difficult to give things away for the Government. Lets say your hospital wants to get rid of 10 old computers. How do you decide who to give them to? What if 15 organizations want them? What if some of those organizations has an office at the hospital or is related to the health care industry? There&apos;s a lot more to consider than just waste here. Political correctness creates a hassle.

Did you remember to wear shoes? cuongp Jun 4th, 2008, 04:06 PM Don&apos;t shop at grocery stores with old equipment and that look ugly and a little dirty. I used to work in a place like that. Here&apos;s what went on:

1) Freezers broke down regularly and anything that thawed out was just refrozen once the freezers were unclogged.

2) Meat was repacked all the time when it got near expiry time. Sometimes chicken was washed to get rid of the smell and slime.

3) Expired cheese, butter and margarine was used to make bakery products.

4) Cheese packaged in the deli was de-molded and repacked.

5) Deli meat that was near or past expiry was bought from shady sales reps.

6) Uninspected meat was bought by various shady people and then packaged for sale in the store.

Generally speaking nothing except packaged non-perishable food was safe from the digusting practices going on. I never ever shop at dirty grocery stores with old equipment.

heres how true these statements are at the loblaws i work at
1)not true, whenever our fridge breaks down, we just move it to another cooler

2)this is true, our meat manager does this all the time, back in the olden day, they washed the chickens with bleach to make it look fresh

3)not sure how true this is but i doubt it, ive always seen them throw out expired dairy products

4)depending on the type of cheese, if its an aged cheese, extra old or at least 1 year, this is actually acceptable because they molding starts from the outside then works it way inside unlike most cheeses where the mold starts from the inside, but then again, we still throw it out

5) and 6) do not apply Mulder and Scully Jun 4th, 2008, 04:40 PM yah i used to work in a hospital (in IT) and towards the end of the fiscal year was like a crazy shopping spree, much of the equipment was never used. it&apos;s really disgusting but true, if they don&apos;t spend the $, it&apos;s less next year. our tax dollars hard at work!

Exactly. Do you know what the research labs do with their grants? Top notch LCD screens, computer systems, laptops, etc. What do they use these for? Torrents and downloads like crazy. My friend who is in research is my main source for movies and stuff.

Many years ago when laser printers, scanners, DVD burners were just beginning to come to the public, our labs bought them right away. Just to use up the budget. Because same thing, or else you won&apos;t get it next year. Totally wasteful of the money from the grants.

Here&apos;s where all your Charity walks, Cure for Cancer dollars are spent. Rarely, rarely do we make a breakthrough discovery to cure cancer. Every research paper they produce is doing a similar experiment, then getting same results, then publishing it with tons and tons of references to make it look like they actually did something new. I read through hundreds of papers in my University days and all of them are like that.

I mean, seriously, CURE Cancer? I doubt it. After how many years of Walkathons, fundraising billions of dollars for Cancer, what&apos;s the way we still use to&quot;help&quot;cancer patients ? Chemotherapy with horrible side effects.

One of my Aunts have colon cancer right now, and when I see what she is going through with the&quot;treatment&quot;, I truly doubt what the heck the scientific field is doing to further the&quot;cure&quot;for cancer.

I don&apos;t know how it feels but it must make you feel really furious about&quot;how far&quot;we&apos;ve come during the last many years. I really hope they find a cure.

As for the types of drugs they prescribe to cancer patients, what are these drugs actually for? Are they to somehow&quot;slow down&quot;or maintain the cancer?

/offtopic derail
As a former&quot;Big Pharma&quot;employee in clinical trials, I can tell you that the term cancer is a catchall for all types of cancer. There are currently hundreds of types and then hundreds of subtypes. Each has it&apos;s own characteristics and each must be treated differently. That being said, there will never be a cure for cancer. There may be cures for some types, but a magic bullet is way too much to ask for. Anti-tumour or anti-cancer drugs are designed for a specific action depending on the type of cancer. Unfortunately, the side effects affect each individual differently. Some are okay while others suffer greatly.
My cancer was cured by surgery without drugs. I was one of the lucky (so to speak) patients.
I certainly hope rfdrfd&apos;s aunt pulls through.

Imagine if you were at the public viewing and all of a sudden you notice gnaw marks on your beloved deceased relative ... nice. joshuaave Jun 6th, 2008, 02:30 AM When you are in the hospital, you are often cared for by Resident MDs of varying levels working under the Specialist MD. Often, it is the experienced RN who knows exactly what needs to be ordered and only calling the Resident as a formality to write the order. Sometimes these Residents, especially if they are just starting their new rotation, have no idea.

Also, for surgery, unless you request no medical students or residents on the consent form, it is not uncommon they will be doing most of the procedure.

Not to knock the system, doctors have to learn somehow. at1212b Jun 6th, 2008, 02:48 AM Exactly. Do you know what the research labs do with their grants? Top notch LCD screens, computer systems, laptops, etc. What do they use these for? Torrents and downloads like crazy. My friend who is in research is my main source for movies and stuff.

Many years ago when laser printers, scanners, DVD burners were just beginning to come to the public, our labs bought them right away. Just to use up the budget. Because same thing, or else you won&apos;t get it next year. Totally wasteful of the money from the grants.

Here&apos;s where all your Charity walks, Cure for Cancer dollars are spent. Rarely, rarely do we make a breakthrough discovery to cure cancer. Every research paper they produce is doing a similar experiment, then getting same results, then publishing it with tons and tons of references to make it look like they actually did something new. I read through hundreds of papers in my University days and all of them are like that.

I mean, seriously, CURE Cancer? I doubt it. After how many years of Walkathons, fundraising billions of dollars for Cancer, what&apos;s the way we still use to&quot;help&quot;cancer patients ? Chemotherapy with horrible side effects.

I mean, truly, with billions of dollars, we can at least find better drugs and methods to kill or take out cancerous cells by 2008 ???


That&apos;s what I&apos;ve always believed in and have said for awhile now. Good to hear confirmation.

Donate here, Diabetes there.. this tsunami thing. My response&quot;sure, there are some well meaning people at the bottom, but the people at the top will of course need a nice big plush chair, Wide screen TV for news in their office, expensive dinners to go over how &apos;allocate&apos; that extra money&quot;. MADD was also embarrassed when it was found out only ~less then 20% was used for what they said it would be used for.

Another interesting point my Soc Prof. pointed out:

You have a organization that is created based on a goal. It then grows and takes on a life of its own now, and like any organization/corporation, it takes on a different mandate... to basically be a ongoing entity. Kind of like a living organism.

Now what happens when they actually achieve their Actual Initial and Main goal?

Simple: The organization would technically no longer exist as it no longer has a purpose anymore.

Therefore it actually has a conflict of interest with its initial goal now, and is no longer its primary purpose of interest. Growth and Survival is. So it will essentially &apos;corrupt&apos; and use its goal to fuel its importance and growth, going to the public that the &apos;Cause&apos; is getting worse and therefore requires more $$ or resources.

Kind of a Fuelling of their &apos;Cause&apos; to be more important and therefore receive more funding. Imagine if they actually found a cure for Breast Cancer? All the current infrastructure in place will not just go away. They will try to find another thing to cause greater panic and hence take &apos;ownership&apos; of. tet8suo Jun 6th, 2008, 09:10 AM :arrowu: Thanks for pointing that out.

Yep.

One more reason why there can&apos;t be a cure for cancer is because of genetics. If your grandma died of cancer, your mom died of cancer, then you will very likely die of cancer (or at least will GET cancer because of genes).

No drugs can help that. Unless in the future we start doing gene manipulation. Blunt Jun 6th, 2008, 11:09 PM Yep.

Essiac... oh give me a break. This is just snake oil. BlueMax Jun 6th, 2008, 11:18 PM Essiac... oh give me a break. This is just snake oil.

Viral marketing? S&apos;okay. Most people trust Big Drug, unlike Big Oil. The cancer researchers are the GOOD guys!

I&apos;m just saying the answers are out there (and no, not limited to one&quot;cure all&quot;... ) Essiac was just one example of a natural method that works for some - but who knows for sure, since official testing and results of natural methods and diet are squelched by those who have the deeper desire to line their pockets.

Putting certain drug, research, convenience/processed/fast/snack food industries out of business is a BAD thing! Human health means little compared to a thriving economy! :lol: peterpatch Jun 7th, 2008, 12:46 AM I worked at the Swiss Chalet in Peterborough Ontario, the one on lansdowne St. Across the road from the Zellers. I worked their for about 4-5 years, part time. They had the worst cockroach problem I have ever seen. They had a massive infestation. I remember one of the cooks showed me how you could see the roaches scurrying arround behind the walls when you shone a light into an empy electrical outlet hole. I have had to put plastic sheets over the dishes and other food surfaces of the kitchen many times in preparation for an Orkin-man visit. The sheets are to protect the surfaces from cross contaminating food with inscecticide.

I remember one particular instance where the raoches had &apos;colonized&apos; the back of one the small bar fridges and the the milk crates that it was standing on. Apparently they like dry warm places, so the compressor/air outflow area of a fridge was a prime roach habitat. The whole time taht we were pulling chicken fingers, prepped stir fries and other things from this fridge there were probably thousands of roaches living 2 inches away from the food, separated by some metal and mechanical parts. Management, in their own self-interest, kept the kitchen running after they found this. I rememver being outside having a smoke when one of the managers brought the infested fridge and crates outside. She poured bleach on the crates and the roaches all fled, the whole road leading out of swiss chalet was awash with small brown cockroaces running away. It was f***ed up to say the least.

They could never get rid of the roaches because the restaurant occupies a building that shares its ceiling space with like 5 others units. So all the units would have to simultaneously implement pest control and eliminate 100% of the population of bugs to obtain any sort of success. The roaches are probably still there, I haven&apos;t worked their in like 9 years though so I can only speculate.

Pretty certain that&apos;s incorrect. I&apos;ve had Federal security clearance for well over two years now...not once have I been told that I was not allowed to tell others the level of my security clearance. Frankly, it makes no difference.

Profs of mine that worked in the federal government also told us their level of security clearance to help explain their point regarding protection of national secrets.

Not a great idea ...&quot;as good as new&quot;sounds like hyperbole or inexperience to me.

Not to mention it&apos;s also opens up a whole can of worms and you can potentially get seriously hurt when exposed to&quot;recharged&quot;alkalines - especially when it&apos;s done by someone who&quot;thinks&quot;they know what they are doing. Even then, an experienced person still cannot cover the unpredictable nature of such an act/process.

Put it this way, if it was feasible, easy and worth it to recharge alkalines ... wouldn&apos;t you think it will be common?

It&apos;s not - and for very good reasons.

Honestly, just be bad for the environment, buy the 48-50 packs of Maxell branded AAs or the bulk packs of AAAs from Walmart for 8-9 bucks and be done with it.

Baloney. Anyone who finds a testable, repeatable and consistent cure for any kind of cancer will be rich beyond their wildest dreams, and that includes big pharma.
Those&quot;researchers&quot;, and BTW those scare quotes are an insult to the dedicated professionals who do this work, are constantly looking for cures. This takes money, time and talent.
Eating and living right help, but won&apos;t prevent cancer if you are predisposed to it.
Makes me crazy when I read messages disparaging these people who are trying to save lives. They may save yours one day (but hopefully you won&apos;t need their talents).
No natural method has ever been shown to cure any kind of cancer in any kind of lab condidtions. I for one chose modern medicine and lived to talk about my experiences. I wouldn&apos;t trust a&quot;natural&quot;therapist with my life any farther than I could throw one.

Not that I doubt the shops, but I doubt anyone can seriously inspect every single inch of the fish meat, 8 hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year without missing something. Even machines break down once in awhile.

Main concern is the methods they use to kill the bacteria, eggs or parasites.

Eating sushi is like flying in a plane. You HOPE the pilot and weather is good. You are there for the ride, nothing you can control. Not every plane will crash, but every year, many planes crash and people do die. We just hope the sushi chef is skilled and follow his procedure every single time.

Seriously, with the existence of this thread, LOTS of workers do NOT follow their proper procedure. That is a fact as you read all these posts.

If not, welcome diaherea, colonscopy and potential health problems. UrbanPoet Jun 9th, 2008, 04:02 PM at least 20% of the time... they dont really have your size!!! they are just too lazy to check... new_poppinfresh Jun 9th, 2008, 04:17 PM took me the whole day to read this....very interesting read.

Job: Canadian Tire

not all security cameras are real! through going to the office where the security monitors are kept, and word of mouth from other employees that go up there, most employees have figured out which are real and which are fake (esp. the teenage part-timers). and man...did some of em do some big spending in the 5-finger discount dept.

They make their profit from paying high schoolers min. wage. and don&apos;t bother trying to get information on products from them, 90% of the time you&apos;ll just get bs. dont piss them off either since theyll prob just lead you in circles or tell you that something is &apos;out of stock&apos;. there IS a way to check when your next stock is coming in on the computer systems, but managers dont like you telling the customer that. i suppose if they dont know, theyll keep coming in randomly and on the off chance might buy something. Also, there is a way to check when the item will go on sale next and at what price (if its within a month or so). so if you know someone working there (and really want something from there, i dont know why you would though), get them to check the next sale date for it.

the reason cdn tire prices are so high is so that when they have a sale and shows the product at 50% off, it looks like a HUGE deal even though that 50% off price is what wal-mart sells the product at regular price.

more to come as i remember them, havent worked there in a few years now... sexpuppet6000 Jun 9th, 2008, 06:27 PM at ice cream places. they swirl your ice cream in the scoop to create a pocket of dead space in the centre. This saves them ice cream and gives you the illusion that you are getting a big scoop. king_george Jun 9th, 2008, 06:32 PM Not that I doubt the shops, but I doubt anyone can seriously inspect every single inch of the fish meat, 8 hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year without missing something. Even machines break down once in awhile.

Main concern is the methods they use to kill the bacteria, eggs or parasites.

Cool.

I thought it was interesting that you mentioned the concept of respiratory depression Vs pain for the client and palliative. It&apos;s something that most people have no idea about because it&apos;s a medical/nursing perspective that is understood once you are in the biz.

Fact is: once you&apos;re palliative (or even before that) and you&apos;re prescribed something like morphine as a comfort measure, it&apos;s a sure sign that chances are you&apos;re going to go see your maker soon. It&apos;s the first clue to the family before you even talk to the doctor that the prognosis isn&apos;t that positive.

Something to keep in mind. joshuaave Jun 10th, 2008, 01:39 AM I thought it was interesting that you mentioned the concept of respiratory depression Vs pain for the client and palliative.

Yes, another important variable is cognition, some patients have higher pain tolerances and rather not be incapacitated; or family members find it distressing when their loved one seems completely out of it.


It&apos;s the first clue to the family before you even talk to the doctor that the prognosis isn&apos;t that positive.

It is heartbreaking to explain a&quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;order, however, the alternative of breaking your ribs and cracking open your chest is certainly not better.

I can&apos;t wait! BlueMax Jun 12th, 2008, 07:31 PM In my new job I get to read letters from shoppers across the country.

Literacy, spelling, penmanship and just plain writing skills in general - have gone down the toilet.&quot;No child left behind&quot;yeah... pass &apos;em to the next grade even if they&apos;re as dumb as a doorknob. :lol: torontorocklacrosse Jun 17th, 2008, 08:06 PM I worked at tim hortons for about 2 years total.

please what ever you do, not order the chilli.
if you could see whats in the bag before we&apos;d boil it in the back you would never eat it. guaranteed a nice layer or film of blood from what ever animal or thing is inside.

also, if you want to know how ice capps are made, its quite simple, you pour 1 part cappicno (from a bag) into 3 parts water(equal ammounts of water. so you would fill the bag 3 times). but in order to do this you need a bucket or something large before putting it into the chiller, slang for what we called the freezer ice cap machine. at my timmes for the longest time we would use this white bucket. this white bucket was also for our used coffee grinds, and any spills.....

i havent ordered food from there since. only coffee:) superock Jun 27th, 2008, 11:08 AM When employees of best buy/futureshop go on the computer to check the&quot;cost&quot;price of a particular item, that price is not the REAL cost price of said item, it is the price that best buy sets that they deem to be a reasonable discount while also ensuring that its not so low that employees start hoarding the product. However they do occasionally screw up and have things appear at their real price and we employees do raid it. There once was a kingston usb flash drive that came up to a total cost of $2 after the 10% employee purchase markup and tax, those things sold out within a matter of an hour.

During the busy seasons when we hire seasonal part timers, the&quot;cost&quot;price of popular items are much higher than they are usually. A good example would be the portable GPS devices, I bought one during the christmas season with my employee discount, about a week after all the seasonals were laid off, I checked the&quot;cost&quot;price again and the damn thing dropped by $80, of course I got my price adjustment.

That just goes to show that even best buy employees don&apos;t get the best deal. I&apos;m pretty sure the managers and higher ups get a much better deal on the products there (but this is unconfirmed). superock Jun 27th, 2008, 11:18 AM btw I&apos;m 1337 :cheesygri

Also I used to work in retail for clothing stores and all I have to say is, wash your clothes after you buy them before you wear it out. That stuff is dirty and filthy due to the stock guys just tossing it on the floor while sorting and people occasionally stepping all over the clothes. skewed Jun 27th, 2008, 11:47 AM please what ever you do, not order the chilli.

When it is inside the bag, it is fine no matter what it looks like since the process to put it in those bags is more than likely regulated and inspected. It is what is done to it after, like you mention with the buckets that worries me.

The fact that the white buckets for the iced cappucinos mix was used with coffee grinds isn&apos;t that bad unless it was left in there for a long time causing mold. The problem comes when employees still use it after using it as a waste bucket.

A lot of the really disgusting stuff happening in food places is mainly caused by dumb people. weedb0y Jun 27th, 2008, 12:08 PM When employees of best buy/futureshop go on the computer to check the&quot;cost&quot;price of a particular item, that price is not the REAL cost price of said item, it is the price that best buy sets that they deem to be a reasonable discount while also ensuring that its not so low that employees start hoarding the product.

When working on a movie set, it may take a whole day if not more just to see a 30 second clip in a movie, or commercial. I remember being on set for 16.5hrs shooting almost the same scenes over and over again. When the final movie was release, only 1-2 mins of it was used.

P.S Jimmy Fallon is a really nice guy in real life, he went around shaking people&apos;s hands and thanking us for doing what we were doing and saying he knows its sucks being an&quot;extra&quot;and that he&apos;s been there.

And that is what genetic engineering is for. It was on the news the other day that there is currently a fetus due on the next couple of months that is&quot;guaranteed&quot;to be free from breast cancer.

It was the father&apos;s family that had the history of breast cancer (every woman in the last three generations, and all before the age of 30), and it&apos;s not reported whether or not the other embryos were destroyed, only that the ones selected were pre-screened NOT to have the gene linked to breast cancer. Not quite as bad as you make it sound, but still, pre-selection based on genetic markers, which opens to the door to all kinds of possibilities, good and bad.

A friend of mine is doing physio at a retirement home. He says that the govt subsidizes physio care for the retirees. They routinely book appointments for the elderly whether they need it or not. If the patient is senile or unable to communicate - they do nothing at all. They always charge the FULL amount allowed.

Pizza Pizza

Most of the time we make good, proper pizzas, really, I think I got fortunate finding a decent job place with no insects, terrible cooks, etc lol (after reading so much about it in this thread!) the only thing is ... our Manager is cheap as hell and never wants to spend proper amount of money. He often doesn&apos;t order enough toppings and we run out of toppings on daily basis, so we have to compensate for them. For example if we run out of feta cheese, we put goat cheese, chances are 95% of customers won&apos;t be able to tell the difference, if we run out of tobasco sauce just mix vinegar with hot sauce and VOILA. Our manager also orders the OIL for frying wings/fries like once in 2 weeks, so most of the time oil is greesy as hell, when we want to have some chicken wings we just cook them in the oven as opposed to frying them in the oil (although it takes 3x longer)

A lot of people figured out that if they complain (even if it&apos;s a fake complain) to Pizza Pizza they will get the same order free of charge again, what they don&apos;t have figured out that if it&apos;s a fake complain we&apos;ll know it, since the cooks always check the pizzas (for toppings, etc) before they give it to drovers (talking about deliveries) so they will know if your complain is real or not, and you don&apos;t wanna know what a pissed off cook can do to your pizza

^ For every complain store receives manager has to pay the company ~$10 if there are 7 complains a week manager has to pay a penalty of $200. That way they try to make the stores please the customers as much as they can

Oh yeah, you know those 3 dollars that you pay for delivery? Well by Pizza Pizza laws those are supposed to go to drivers for gas, but all the managers from the stores (in Toronto anyway) got together and decided to keep those 3 bucks for every delivery instead of giving it to the drivers. But I&apos;ll be honest if drivers got to keep 3 bucks for every delivery they make + salary + tips on top of that.... they&apos;d be making $30 or more an hour easy on a busy day.

You&apos;ll still get fresh fries if you ask for no salt though. convoluted Jul 5th, 2008, 07:08 PM One time at pizza pizza, I complained there was a long curly hair in my food, and the owner/staff said it was not theirs. The ovens are hot enough to melt the hair he said. I had blue hair, and my friend had short hair so it clearly was not ours. I should have filed a complaint at the time, but they definitely were not bending over backwards to accommodate.


Oh my god, loved every single page of this topic! I gotta contribute!

Pizza Pizza

Most of the time we make good, proper pizzas, really, I think I got fortunate finding a decent job place with no insects, terrible cooks, etc lol (after reading so much about it in this thread!) the only thing is ... our Manager is cheap as hell and never wants to spend proper amount of money. He often doesn&apos;t order enough toppings and we run out of toppings on daily basis, so we have to compensate for them. For example if we run out of feta cheese, we put goat cheese, chances are 95% of customers won&apos;t be able to tell the difference, if we run out of tobasco sauce just mix vinegar with hot sauce and VOILA. Our manager also orders the OIL for frying wings/fries like once in 2 weeks, so most of the time oil is greesy as hell, when we want to have some chicken wings we just cook them in the oven as opposed to frying them in the oil (although it takes 3x longer)

A lot of people figured out that if they complain (even if it&apos;s a fake complain) to Pizza Pizza they will get the same order free of charge again, what they don&apos;t have figured out that if it&apos;s a fake complain we&apos;ll know it, since the cooks always check the pizzas (for toppings, etc) before they give it to drovers (talking about deliveries) so they will know if your complain is real or not, and you don&apos;t wanna know what a pissed off cook can do to your pizza

^ For every complain store receives manager has to pay the company ~$10 if there are 7 complains a week manager has to pay a penalty of $200. That way they try to make the stores please the customers as much as they can

Oh yeah, you know those 3 dollars that you pay for delivery? Well by Pizza Pizza laws those are supposed to go to drivers for gas, but all the managers from the stores (in Toronto anyway) got together and decided to keep those 3 bucks for every delivery instead of giving it to the drivers. But I&apos;ll be honest if drivers got to keep 3 bucks for every delivery they make + salary + tips on top of that.... they&apos;d be making $30 or more an hour easy on a busy day.

Might add some later nerdnik Jul 5th, 2008, 10:39 PM On the TTC when some drivers get tired of driving, they put on the&quot;Out of Service&quot;sign on the bus. They then drive the bus off to be&quot;fixed&quot;or checked out. Doing nothing and chilling for a couple of hours while getting full pay.

Where do people come up with this ****? I mean, really?! Buses are tracked and monitored at all times. They have been for, I would guess, the last 15 years. The bus literally appears as a blip on a map and is tracked.

Drivers are also to follow the schedule -- this is tracked and displayed on the machine you see in front of the fare box (it appears as + 10 minutes or - 10 minutes when ahead of, or behind the set schedule, respectively; the display is angled and only seen by the driver). When the driver is ahead of schedule, by say, 10 minutes, they get a call from their boss asking them what&apos;s up and to park the bus to the side to get back on schedule. Similarly, if the driver is behind schedule by a considerable amount, a call comes in and the driver has to explain why (like an accident holding up traffic). Sometimes this is remedied by the bus becoming a&quot;short turn&quot;bus, so if you&apos;ve ever been in this situation where you were asked to unexpectedly exit the bus and wait for the next one, this is could very well be why.

2 question:

how do bus drivers take their breaks? does the super radio in? when you are given a break are you obligated to park your bus (so as to conserve gas) until the shift commences again?

when a ttc bus driver is done his shift, does he put on the out of service sign? Is he given a time frame to return his bus to the TTC hangar/garage?

thnx. nerdnik Jul 5th, 2008, 11:28 PM 2 question:

thnx.

Bus drivers do not choose their breaks -- it is chosen for them in advance. They do not have to clock out during this time, if that is what you&apos;re asking. They sign in at the beginning of their shift, entering their employee number, bus number and route number (if I remember correctly) and sign out at the end of their shift.

I don&apos;t know that there is necessarily a hard rule about turning off the engine when on break, but any time my father (who was a TTC driver for over 30 years) took his break, he turned it off. As did the other drivers who took their breaks while I was on their buses.

When the driver is done his or her shift, one of two things happen:
1) The bus is returned to the parking garage; or
2) Another driver takes over the bus, usually when the bus returns to the bus station, but sometimes the shift switches are done in really random spots!

I don&apos;t have an answer to your last question -- about whether they are given a time frame to return the bus to the garage. If you are trying to ask whether TTC drivers take some time to joyride after their shift, then no, this is strictly prohibited and grounds for termination. Remember, their every move is tracked! Even after their shift ends. nerdnik Jul 5th, 2008, 11:31 PM So I read this entire thread from beginning to end over the course of a few days. There&apos;s no way I can find the post now, but someone said something about the black CIBC debit card as being a way to identify yourself as a VIP and skip the line.

I have one of those black cards (it&apos;s an investor&apos;s account) and they certainly DO treat me as a preferred customer. I get much better service now then when I had the regular card.

However, people don&apos;t stand in line holding their debit cards in their hands, nor are they asked by the CIBC greeter what colour card they&apos;re holding. So how can they skip the line?? I think I see an actual teller, like, once per year, so it doesn&apos;t matter, but just wondering ... dairymandip Jul 5th, 2008, 11:35 PM Where do people come up with this ****? I mean, really?!

Say you had a bad experience with a bus driver and call into customer service, does anything actually get done to the bus driver? i remember this bus driver was really giving me a problem I called ttc and didn&apos;t see him on that route ever again shrugs kkentm Jul 5th, 2008, 11:46 PM So I recently got hired at McDonalds and I&apos;ll share some secrets.

The biggest surprise to me was that anyone in the&quot;kitchen&quot;will put some patties on the stove to cook (handling them raw and frozen) and will not wash their hands before assembling burgers for other customers. This is because burgers need to be cooked so often and there is no one designated to that job. Whoever is available will cook the burgers. I&apos;m not sure how&quot;hygenic&quot;it is to handle raw burgers even if they&apos;re frozen and cross contaminate directly with prepared food but I&apos;m sure customers wouldn&apos;t apprecient knowing this =P nano Jul 5th, 2008, 11:56 PM ttc

when a driver uses one of the sick days, their supervisor tries to ask other people who are not working to take that shift. 99.9% of union employees will say no, even if it means they will get overtime because when everybody says no, it&apos;s as if there are not enough employees and the ttc can hire more people every year. people who take the shifts are branded as outsiders and you will get dirty cut eye from other union workers. you are either with the union or against it. kindof like what other places do with their budgets. if they see that they do have enough employees, they will start laying people off.

the TTC wont lay people off most days they don&apos;t have enough bus drivers... jcoltage Jul 6th, 2008, 12:08 AM so its only +10 -10 right? , i take the same bus every day so I know the exact time its suppose to appear yet when an ew bus driver takes over the route they will stop at tim hortons for say 5 minutes and then continue on

If it goes over +10 the controller gets an alarm in his station office and then sends a msg over the radio to the driver if there is another bus behind them to unload all the passengers to the other bus and then turn around to catch up.

Example the bus driver gave me

Don Mills North Bound ... bus in over ten mins ... unloads all the passengers on second bus which should be behind it. then turn around at finch and it will be caught up on schedule since it is 10 mins behind and it takes 10 min north to steeles and 10 mins back therefore it would be 20 mins behind schedule if it did not turned around at finch.

and why the bus driver gave me a lesson - i said thank you when he handed me a transfer I guess? but I did not mind I was in no rush and I learned a lot but a lot of people gave me the evil eye cause he started driving real slow.

I kept quiet but he kept showing me things ... so whatever. nerdnik Jul 6th, 2008, 12:18 AM so its only +10 -10 right? , i take the same bus every day so I know the exact time its suppose to appear yet when an ew bus driver takes over the route they will stop at tim hortons for say 5 minutes and then continue on

To be honest, I was only using the number 10 as an example. My dad passed away, so I don&apos;t know the answer. nerdnik Jul 6th, 2008, 12:21 AM Say you had a bad experience with a bus driver and call into customer service, does anything actually get done to the bus driver? i remember this bus driver was really giving me a problem I called ttc and didn&apos;t see him on that route ever again shrugs

Eh, not really. Not unless it was something unforgivable. My dad was a real stickler for the rules. Didn&apos;t have your student card? You had to pay adult fare. If you refused, he&apos;d not only stay at the stop, he&apos;d turn off the engine and make everyone wait while you changed your attitude and paid up. Yeah, he was one of those! So he got lots of complaints, but as I said, he was with the company for over 30 years so ... nerdnik Jul 6th, 2008, 12:27 AM So with all this talk about the TTC, I might as well offer up a&quot;secret.&quot;This was true as of 2 1/2 years ago ... I can&apos;t see how this would work now that metropasses are transferable.

It used to be that drivers were encouraged to compare the numbers on your metropass with the photo ID displayed above it. If they didn&apos;t match (ie you were using a friend or family member&apos;s card) it could get confiscated. Normally why would a driver care, right? Well, the company rewarded them ... I think it was something like $4 per confiscated pass. Or maybe it was half that. I honestly can&apos;t remember. My dad also confiscated lots of student cards ... no idea why. He brought in an extra couple hundred dollars per month this way. jcoltage Jul 6th, 2008, 12:35 AM To be honest, I was only using the number 10 as an example. My dad passed away, so I don&apos;t know the answer.

It is +10/-10 and then an alarm goes off and they dial in 3 numbers to confirm they know and it goes off every 5 mins till they catch up and it is recorded .... also those guys you see with notepads watching the buses are&quot;just for public image&quot;in theory are useless according to that bus driver since the computer tracks everything by the Bell Radio.. oh and if the bus driver is in trouble a cop can be on the bus in less than 4 mins and 8 mins for medical personal. reddealer13 Jul 6th, 2008, 04:47 PM Finally finished reading this forum and found lots of interesting things and caught a lot of BS.

When it comes to Best Buy some people mentioned that the employees weren&apos;t trained and thats a lie. Every employee, especially in computers and home theaters get product training. Some times people think this because they talk to new temporaries who may not know as much.

Are you sure about that? Maybe the conceptual design and layout of a flyer is completed 6 months in advance but the flyers? That&apos;s surprising.

Okay, might as well add something for the fun of it. I used to do some TA work for a prof at Ryerson during my masters studies. The classes were 2nd and 3rd year classes in business/economics geography. I was shocked at how many students were unable to form a proper sentence, let alone write an entire paragraph. Most of the essays I read were absolutely horrible. Several students copied, word for word, straight out of wikipedia but the best part was they sourced the entire thing hahaha!!! Fortunately for the students, I was told not to mark on grammar or writing skills but to mark purely on material. Kind of hard to do if you don&apos;t understand what a student is writing. The prof (perhaps Ryerson) probably did this because for the majority of students, English was a second language.

My favourite essay was one in which a student wrote about how technology advanced, allowing businesses to expand their markets. Then as an example, the student put a picture of an American soldier holding a gun and included a caption along the lines of&quot;An example of modern day technology&quot;. It was so funny I even shared it with my friends (I know, that was really mean of me :evil: ).

The saddest thing about it was the class average at the end of the year was about 40% (I think only 2 people actually passed). However, the prof didn&apos;t want to fail the entire class so she boosted all the marks resulting in a class average of about 65%.

And to think I always wondered why TAs and profs told me I had excellent writing skills. I wonder if this is true with classes in other universities. Don&apos;t remember ever getting a huge bump on my mark at UofT during my undergrad.

Unless things have changed since I worked for them, that isn&apos;t quite right. In most cases they would barely have ordered the stock for most sales or known the prices 6 mos. out. For big regular sales like Bay Day they would have some idea, same for any big promo like Christmas maybe (at which point rough layouts etc. would be started early) but for the most part we used to order stock about 2 months out and final proof of the ads/flyers would be done from a few weeks out to days ahead (depending on where it was printed). Six months out is generally a little far out for most items although some imported goods etc. could easily be ordered even earlier than that. Meanwhile, they (the local managers) always know what is coming on sale within 6 weeks or so of a sale.

The flyers are delivered from the printers to the HBC head office about 6 weeks before publication. So I would imagine store managers get them around the same time. Mr Nobody Jul 7th, 2008, 11:40 AM I&apos;ve been following this thread pretty much from the beginning. We all know about food horror stories, but I really found the TTC stuff facinating. Thanks nerdnik.

I haven&apos;t taken the TTC regularly in years, and its been mostly subway rides when I have to. Regarding buses, from what I gathered through observation, the stops are being automatically announced based on position? GPS or dedicated proprietary system?

I should go downtown and ride the streetcar one day. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been on a streetcar in 10 years. :) RuLa Of Da WoRlD Jul 7th, 2008, 02:52 PM When you get fries and mc donalds, just tap the bottom of the container on the counter, the fries will sink in and you can ask for more. the employees hold the container a certain way that makes the fries get stuck in the middle that way there is empty space at the bottom. try it the next time u get fries :D

the only exception to this is the white paper container.

i work at mcdonalds for a part time job and we are told to squeeze the box a little bit to prevent the fires from bunching up in the middle(what u got when u had to tap it occurs when the people dont squeeze the box) squeezing the box a bit equals to more amount of fries! RuLa Of Da WoRlD Jul 7th, 2008, 03:21 PM Swiss Chalet sauce is made in a similar fashion.

Tim Hortons - They use the same spoon to stir the coffee and never wash it. Next time you go get your double double, look for the spoon they use.



same thing at mcdonalds sillysimms Jul 7th, 2008, 03:25 PM I find this thread really interesting. I&apos;ve been looking at the&quot;spoon&quot;at every Tim Hortons that I&apos;ve been to since reading about it on this thread. I have not yet seen one in ice. Each location has it in water and doesn&apos;t seem to replace it once the ice melts.

Many years ago I worked at a McDonalds for a couple months. Not sure if this is still their policy, but at the time we were told we could not wear coloured nail polish. They were concerned that if it chipped it would get into the food and be seen. BUT - here&apos;s the thing - we weren&apos;t allowed to wear coloured nail polish - clear nail polish was okay (because if it chipped no one would see it!)

Only way he eats fish is if its fresh, and being landlocked does pose a bit of an issue.

A butcher once told me that the packers inject water into meat to make it look more&quot;juicy&quot;when you&apos;re buying it. Compare the size of that chicken breast before cooking and afterwards, next time.

And, when we raised our own beef, didn&apos;t put horomones into them, never ran them on grass, fed them only wheat, and then hung the carcasses for 21-28 days.

Some of this&quot;Canada grade A beef&quot;is from the US, corn fed, maybe hung a week. Wonder why your steak tastes funny and is tough?

I worked as a butcher about 6-8 years ago and I saw how all the meat came in from the slaughter houses.

Nothing is done to the meat (ie, injecting) at the store level (at least, at our store). All we did was take the meat out of the box, drain the excess goo for chicken or blood for beef from the boxes to make sure that the bottom of the garbage boxes wouldn&apos;t collapse when going to the compactor, and then cut them and tray them as specified.

Meat will always shrink when it&apos;s cooked...but it&apos;s not because the meat was&quot;injected&quot;with additional water by the packers. dealguy2 Jul 7th, 2008, 06:19 PM pack well for checked-in luggages when flying. they get SLAMMMED.

As for secrets on my end, most of it has been covered already, but here are a few pieces of &apos;information&apos; at best:

Best Buy, when i worked in inventory a lot of stuff used to go missing, memory sticks, games etc..., when we used to unload trucks. Also i found it odd that the washroom did not have a product detector, contributing even more to the high shrink.

Future Shop, haven&apos;t worked there in a while either, you can further maximize your discount by adding regular software from the shelves to the mix, any &apos;informed&apos; sales guy can make some extra commission by packaging an install sku with it. Finally stay away from energy speakers, although they are supposedly a good brand, the markups are pretty high, i think we used to get 50% off, same goes for most things in home theater, such as stands, mounts, cables etc... Finally in many instances, customers are told the product is out of stock because it is a &apos;dry&apos; sale, specifically because there is little commission, low gm, no additional accessories, rude customer, hot product being saved for a chance at a &apos;quality sale&apos;....furthermore i have seen cases where potential pm&apos;s are subverted by managers telling associates to &apos;walk&apos; customers.

what does it mean to &apos;walk&apos; a customer? monty613 Jul 7th, 2008, 11:41 PM what does it mean to &apos;walk&apos; a customer?

purposely not make the sale, and have the customer walk on the deal nerdnik Jul 8th, 2008, 10:07 PM The flyers are delivered from the printers to the HBC head office about 6 weeks before publication. So I would imagine store managers get them around the same time.

I don&apos;t work for Hbc&apos;s advertising, but that&apos;s what I have been told on a number of occasions. It might be that at 6 months out, everything is in place and only the prices haven&apos;t been finalized, as I&apos;ve often seen prelim flyers/magazines with the models/products with the price as $00.00.

Without getting myself in trouble admitting what Hbc Management is capable of knowing and how far in advance, I can confirm that they certainly do NOT have access as far as six weeks in advance. danns Jul 8th, 2008, 10:15 PM Friend of ours was a fisherman in N.S., now living in AB (the good life :cheesygri ). Anyways, he says that we would NEVER eat canned fish. Said that the fish that had growths on them, worms, etc, all went to the cannery.

Only way he eats fish is if its fresh, and being landlocked does pose a bit of an issue.

A butcher once told me that the packers inject water into meat to make it look more&quot;juicy&quot;when you&apos;re buying it. Compare the size of that chicken breast before cooking and afterwards, next time.

And, when we raised our own beef, didn&apos;t put horomones into them, never ran them on grass, fed them only wheat, and then hung the carcasses for 21-28 days.

Some of this&quot;Canada grade A beef&quot;is from the US, corn fed, maybe hung a week. Wonder why your steak tastes funny and is tough?

On average a pizza delivery driver makes $30-$50 in tips a day (depending on the day of the week and how busy it is) not including their salary (usually $7 an hour). They can easily make over $100 on a very busy day. I know one driver who got over $200 in tips in 1 day, forget which holiday it was, let&apos;s just say manager had to call 2 extra drivers who were off duty to help out

They rarely get parking tickets, in 1 year that I&apos;ve worked I&apos;ve only seen two drivers get those and I&apos;m pretty sure one of them was lifted anyway (no where else to park) Siefer999 Jul 9th, 2008, 12:54 AM i work at mcdonalds for a part time job and we are told to squeeze the box a little bit to prevent the fires from bunching up in the middle(what u got when u had to tap it occurs when the people dont squeeze the box) squeezing the box a bit equals to more amount of fries!

What is an&quot;empty prepaid visa card&quot;? st7860 Jul 11th, 2008, 02:24 PM What is an&quot;empty prepaid visa card&quot;?

a visa card you buy from 7-11 or safeway or something for $2 + the amount you put in it. its a prepaid visa card. spend all the money on it, and then, you can use it in some parking machines to get free parking.

you can do the same thing with old visa cards too. report your card stolen, then you&apos;ll get a new card in the mail. use the old card to get free parking. mjl_toronto Jul 11th, 2008, 03:46 PM use the old card to get free parking.

It&apos;s not free, it&apos;s stealing or taking advantage of the system. Used to work with old Dave&amp;Busters cards too :D Hugh Jass Jul 11th, 2008, 04:22 PM parking lots in vancouver and toronto and most other places will often accept empty prepaid visa cards!

So one of these &apos;credit card in, same credit card out&apos; places, will unknowingly charge a card that can&apos;t be charged?

it will work in any place that doesn&apos;t have live credit card verification. you don&apos;t know until you try. but typically, many parking machines don&apos;t have live verifications since that saves them the cost of a phone line.

you can use empty prepaid visa cards, empty prepaid mastercard, and regular credit cards that have been deactivated. usually they&apos;ll work for 4 to 5 days per card. &apos;some&apos; gift cards also work(rumours, such as futureshop ones, empty ones, etc) Jay-c Jul 11th, 2008, 09:21 PM you can do the same thing with old visa cards too. report your card stolen, then you&apos;ll get a new card in the mail. use the old card to get free parking.

Charges from the&quot;old&quot;card are transferred to the&quot;new&quot;card - you have the same account with the credit card providor. Whether or not you choose to identify these charge as legit or fraud once the transactions are batched and sent to the bank, will be up to you. given the point of this attempt, I suppose you would choose to dispute he charges as fraud.. which when I stop to think about it, is about as fraudulant as yourself making the transaction in the first place!

If you choose to go the route of&quot;damaged&quot;, you&apos;re still SOL, since charges will still appear on your account. st7860 Jul 11th, 2008, 09:23 PM Charges from the&quot;old&quot;card are transferred to the&quot;new&quot;card - you have the same account with the credit card providor.

charges are NOT transffered if you report the card LOST or STOLEN. they will in this case give you a new number.

charges ARE transferred if you just ask for a new card because you wore the old one out. they will in this case print a card with the same number. miss_swan Jul 11th, 2008, 10:12 PM I hate Impark as much as the next person ... but this seems like alot of&quot;work&quot;to save yourself a little bit of money ... it also seems a bit sketchy but I won&apos;t get into that any more ...:cheesygri st7860 Jul 11th, 2008, 10:13 PM you don&apos;t have to cancel a credit card to do it. just get a prepaid visa or mastercard, then spend all the money, then use the empty card. nobb Jul 15th, 2008, 12:35 AM I worked a summer job at a Joey Tomatoes in Calgary a few years ago. It was such a rush that the cooks dont really have time to wash their hands after handling raw stuff. One minute they would be grabbing a handful of raw meat and dumping it into the fryer, the next minute they would be manually piling the cooked meat with the same hands on a plate. The cooks would be yelled at if the plates where not piled up high enough.

touching cooked foods after touching raw meet without washing your hands should not be a regular practice at other restaurants....in fact it&apos;s dangerous and the person eating the food could get food poisioning. cheeseshredder Jul 15th, 2008, 01:12 AM I worked a summer job at a Joey Tomatoes in Calgary a few years ago.

It is common.

At the place I work, there&apos;s not even a sink on the kitchen line (and this is a large chain, so I&apos;d imagine other places with less standards are worse). The best that the cooks do is dip their hands in a dirty buckle of water used for rinsing tongs and spatulas.

During any of the rushes, it&apos;s so frantic that if you spend time to properly wash your hands after handling raw food and plating, you&apos;ll get screwed.

So yeah...cook and eat at home. geremy Jul 15th, 2008, 01:25 AM So I recently got hired at McDonalds and I&apos;ll share some secrets.

The biggest surprise to me was that anyone in the&quot;kitchen&quot;will put some patties on the stove to cook (handling them raw and frozen) and will not wash their hands before assembling burgers for other customers. This is because burgers need to be cooked so often and there is no one designated to that job. Whoever is available will cook the burgers. I&apos;m not sure how&quot;hygenic&quot;it is to handle raw burgers even if they&apos;re frozen and cross contaminate directly with prepared food but I&apos;m sure customers wouldn&apos;t apprecient knowing this =P

I&apos;ve worked at McDonald&apos;s since Summer 2006, and I can say that this is NOT a regular occurrence. When we put any meat, whether it be grilled chicken, breaded chicken, McNuggets, or red meat/beef, we ALWAYS wash our hands before doing anything else. Maybe your co-workers are extremely lazy, but your managers should be enforcing the proper policies. As an employee, it&apos;s also your responsibility to report this kind of thing (you can do it anonymously) and head office will deal with it.

ANYWAY...

My #1 tip at McDonald&apos;s (which may have already been given away here) is to ask for unsalted fries. That way, you always get them hot, and you can add the salt yourself (there&apos;s usually little packets near the napkins and straws).

#2...make your own ice coffee! This is my own formula I made long before McDonald&apos;s introduced ice coffee in Canada. Get a small black coffee with 3/4 sugars in it, and ask for a large McFlurry cup 3/4 full of ice with 2 creams. When you get to your table, pour the hot coffee into the McFlurry cup and stir using a stirstick...it tastes just like the plain/non-flavoured ice coffee they serve, but for $1.12, not $1.46. If you want vanilla or hazelnut, forget about this tip though! If you are an employee, this drink is technically FREE for you since cups are free, hot coffee is free, and ice is free. I don&apos;t understand why they&apos;re too cheap to let us drink the real ice coffee though.

And please, just be respectful to the people at the front counter because it&apos;s NOT an easy job for everyone. AND THROW OUT YOUR OWN GARBAGE.

I spent all of my high school and undergrad years working in restaurants and not ONCE did I ever do this, nor did I ever see anyone who did. Obviously, this place is the exception rather than the rule. I&apos;m sure the health inspectors would have a field day at that place. st7860 Jul 15th, 2008, 10:31 AM http://www.news1130.com/news/topstory/article.jsp?content=20080530_091337_4276
VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) - Here&apos;s a list you may want to consult before making your Friday night dinner plans. The Vancouver Coastal Health Authority has released the names of 50 local restaurants that have been written up for unhealthy practices.

The list comes with a host of unappetizing explanations. The Success Seafood Restaurant in Richmond was ordered to close twice in six weeks because of rats and unsanitary conditions.

Today some people say the annual hit list reassures them the system is working. For one man though, it&apos;s the variety of infractions that kills the appetite. He says he assumes that if they&apos;re open and licensed, they&apos;re professional. He says this is Vancouver, this isn&apos;t a third world country.

Some of the Vancouver restaurants forced temporarily closed include Kam&apos;s Bakery on Main Street and Little Caesar&apos;s Pizza on East 22nd. The rest of the list can be found here http://www.vch.ca/environmental/docs/food/food_closures.pdf nobb Jul 15th, 2008, 11:02 AM I spent all of my high school and undergrad years working in restaurants and not ONCE did I ever do this, nor did I ever see anyone who did. Obviously, this place is the exception rather than the rule. I&apos;m sure the health inspectors would have a field day at that place.

But is a health inspection really going to change anything? They will just put on a pretty show when the health inspector is here, but merely go back to what they were doing before when the inspector leaves.

I wonder if this happens often at the higher class restaurants where the chefs usually&quot;pile up high&quot;or manually arrange the food on the plate with their hands to make it look more appealing when served. Quite frankly, I rather my food not be touched even if the plate wont look as good. crashz Jul 15th, 2008, 12:39 PM Well...though this is a good start., what I&apos;d REALLY like to learn, is:

At Staples:
1)Where do I look for hidden stock
2)If the rep is having a problem processing a pm., how do i navigate the menus to faclitate the process over-riding key authorization only steps :D

Same questions to FS.BB., etc :lol:

Hidden stock. I worked at Staples for 5 years and there was never anything&quot;Hidden&quot;, unless you mean where the actual stock is kept of the demo products on the shelves. Overstock is in the aisles. All electronics and software are usually locked in a separate storage area. Computers, PDA&apos;s (anything high end) as well as software are locked away in an area that is accessible only by a manager on duty. Lighter secutirty items like phones, entry level printers, labellers, etc, are in a secured area that is accessed by one of the associates on staff in the electronics area.

PM&apos;s are pretty simple on the till. I never even worked cash. But the screen allows them to override the price for a PM and they just have to verify the Ad, confirm stock and they can process the PM up to a certain dollar amount. Any higher requires a Manager to basicaly key in a code to allow the override. In most cases the cashiers knew the managers code and usually just call the manager to let them know what they are doing and under the managers&apos; discretion, they will say do it or wait till they get there.

Sure it might not work that way at all stores. We had a good 2-3 year period where there was very little turnover in our location so everyone was pretty tight and there was a lot of trust management had in the staff. Rekognize Jul 15th, 2008, 12:48 PM I worked at Staples for 5 years

I can&apos;t speak for Ontario, but you&apos;d be surprised what a heath inspector can find, despite your attempts to hide it. I worked in several restaurants and hotels and not once did I eve come across the problem that others described above. In fact, if you ever get a chance to eat at a Bob Evans restaurant in the US (I&apos;m not even sure if they still exist), then do it. It was by far the cleanest place I&apos;d ever worked. Meats were never frozen, and were brought in 3 times a week (so they didn&apos;t even sit in the walk-in very long). Fridges on the grill line were washed out EVERY NIGHT, and you could virtually see yourself in the grill at any given time, rush hour or not. I just hated the little paper&quot;hats&quot;they made us wear to look like 1950&apos; short order cooks. LOL pitz Jul 15th, 2008, 02:21 PM Many years ago, I had a job doing electrical inspection in rural areas of the province in which I lived.

There were a few electrical customers who used a ton of electricity (the meters was turning like crazy), but the yard was otherwise completely empty and nothing resembling liveable accomodations was present.

I suspect that these people might have been growing &apos;stuff&apos; hydroponically. But since I wasn&apos;t a police officer with a search warrant.....

the nachos are made in some room by employees, if your nachos seem light is because some employee is too lazy to follow the guide lines and just dumps&apos;em in.

did you know employees make commision selling off combos? i made 100+ in 2 weeks selling combos

ask for butter after you have paid, you get free butter, but if they still say you have to pay, get all strict and be like&quot;you didnt ask for me butter, can i speak to your manager, since the employee is just a young kid they&apos;ll prolly give it.

dont be rude to employees working concessions they&apos;ll either over charge, or give you the least freshest food

you can basically sneak into any theatre once you get in

heres the big one, if its rly busy, and theres a long line and an open candy display, go up there take the candy, get back in the big line, and when the employee turns his back, walk away..

You can do this in any store in the world, but if you get caught you risk being arrested.

Great advice&gt;:( Rishi Aug 10th, 2008, 12:05 AM lol

Yes there is a name for that, it&apos;s called theft under $5000. Jucius Maximus Aug 10th, 2008, 12:09 AM This thread is so great. I kinda wish I had worked some kind of sleazy retail job so I would have stories to post.

oh temptation.... gretzky99 Aug 10th, 2008, 01:04 AM Why is there a need to steal those drink coupons when Starbucks has great benefits for it&apos;s employees?

Why???

Do a search in the BST thread. They are in hot demand.
There were tons of these Starbuck free drink certificates being sold in lump sum quantities of 20 and 10 stacks. Frankie3s Aug 10th, 2008, 01:57 AM Frankie3S, are you the actual Frankie3S that plays third strike?

Nope. jbpriede Aug 10th, 2008, 07:51 AM A few year ago, working a part-time (well full time with zero responsibilities, so felt like part time) CSR job with Barnes and Noble, the guidelines consider Canada an&quot;international destination&quot;.

Another policy is that any damaged item (i.e. dvd with a torn cover, book with bent pages) sent to an international destination, worth US $50 or less is replaced without asking for the original item to be returned.

Not too usefull unless you want 2 copies of that $49 movie for xmas gifts, etc.

Was a better deal when Canada $1 = US $0.66

Jeremy EM_K19 Aug 18th, 2008, 05:29 PM Here is my experiences from working at Baskin Robbins, Laura Secord, and Game Shack.

1) I&apos;ve seen lot of people complain when they get an ice cream from the bottom of the tub, and demand that they want a new tub so they get a fresh one. Well, they&apos;re dead wrong. The ice cream at the top of the tub actually is the part that melts the fastest. Basically you are getting a part of the ice cream that thawed a bit then got refrozen; hardly fresh, and more chance of bacteria in the ice cream itself. Combined with the tendencies of many stores to keep the freezer temperature at the bare minimum (so it is easier to scoop, however, this makes the ice cream melt easier), and topping the new tub off with the bottoms of the previously finished tub, there is a big risk here. So you&apos;ll almost always want to go with the ice cream that has at least reached the middle of the tub.

2) You&apos;ll almost always get more ice cream served in a cup rather than a cone. There is more of a tendency for the employees to try to&quot;fill&quot;a cup, and they scoop less for the cones since it&apos;s easier for the ice cream to stay on the cone that way. A sneaky way to get around this is to ask for a cup in the beginning, then ask for the cone later.

3) If you know anyone working at Baskin Robbins, and would like to buy a Ice Cream cake, ask them for the discount; it&apos;s a whooping 50% discount for the employees for the cakes, provided that they make it themselves at their own time.

4) When trading games in, don&apos;t bother taking old sports game with you. You&apos;re better off keeping it. The trade value for them worth the least out of any games ($2 max), and many stores won&apos;t even take them, period.

5) I&apos;m not sure about EB Games or other stores, but when trading at Game Shack, it is IMPORTANT to be nice to the employees. We did have degree of leniency on raising value of the trade-in games, and usually, it is based on how much we like you. If you act like a jerk, we&apos;d happily knock out $5 off something that is otherwise worth $10.

6) Also, if you insist in bringing 30+ games next time you trade in something, expect to get lower value for each of the item. It can be an absolute pain for the employees to check through all of them, and usually they round the number off at their own discretion.

7) When trading in a game/system, make sure you check for its availability within that store. More copies of that game the store has, lesser the trade value you get, and it doesn&apos;t matter how good or popular that game is. This can mean $5 to even $10 difference, believe it or not.

8) Also, next time you bring in a game, DO YOUR RESEARCH about how much it is really worth. Most game stores do not take into consideration how rare a game is or how much it is worth in general. You&apos;re gonna bring in Final Fantasy VII, PS2 Marvel Vs Capcom 2 or PSX version of Valkyrie Profile? We&apos;re still paying you $5 for them. If anything, most employees will buy it off you at a ridiculously low price, buy it in-store immediately after, then sell them on ebay for crazy profit. Believe it or not, I got this at the store OFTEN, and told them how much it is really worth so they don&apos;t get screwed over. But do your research... most employees won&apos;t be as nice as I was. :twisted:

9) Most people know this, but realize that either missing a case or missing an instruction book (or both) is REALLY detrimental to your trade-in value. We&apos;re talking 25-50%. EM_K19 Aug 18th, 2008, 10:25 PM Few More:

- My parents own a successful burger joint in Mississauga, and I worked at the restaurant a few times. Being the boss&apos; son and all, everyone tried to get in good terms with me, and this one cook in particular gave me an interesting gift once... a HALF A ZIPLOCK BAG FULL of Timmy&apos;s&quot;Roll up the rim&quot;coupons!! Where did he get it? Well, he is in really good terms with a manager at a local Tim Hortons, who hooked him up with it. I know there are many people who had always suspected by that the contest is rigged by Timmy&apos;s managers and workers, and this just confirmed my belief (note: obviously doesn&apos;t apply to all stores, but shows there are definitely some stores that are corrupt). Anyways, needless to say, I didn&apos;t pay for any donuts or coffee for the next two months. :D

- I worked at a Square Boy Pizza once in Port Perry, where they served oven-baked wings... these obviously came frozen like they do anywhere else, and when we had to cook them, we had to defrost them first (since these weren&apos;t deep fried). The bad part? These were soaked in warm water the previous night, and left to defrost until the next morning, when it would be separated and floating in a nasty goo of funky-coloured water. What&apos;s worse? This was all done in the same sink where you clean dishes, and dump out the mop water. This, combined with many other shady practices of this place, made me quit soon after. convoluted Aug 20th, 2008, 10:24 AM Few More:

No actually. The stubs were clearly not worn out or stained, and you could tell these were rolled right out of the wrapper and cut with scissors, not ripped. darkprince Sep 2nd, 2008, 12:30 AM When i use to work at Candy Time @ CNE we use to sell all we possibly could have.

For example, one time someone came back to us cuz they dropped their candy apple, we exchanged it and I was told to just wash it and wrap it back up. The ice we used usually had tiny pieces of dirt in it. When i saw a wasp in one of the cotton candys and told the manager, she told me to sell that bag next, and when one of the other co workers cut their fingers, she was still told to make the cotton candy(we didn&apos;t have gloves) so blood got into the candy.

I was only there for three days and i reported them but i don&apos;t think anything was done =/... oh well buyer beware :)

I was at CNE this year and there was this Stand in the Food Building forgot what it was called. But they were selling Foot Long Corn Dogs and&quot;HoneyDew Drinks&quot;and my gf noticed that the have health inspectors gave them a&quot;conditional pass&quot;that&apos;s when i notice the honeydew juice tank was blackish and moldy then i notice the guy that took our money was also the guy that made the corn dogs. He took our money and didn&apos;t even washed his hands or put on gloves and its ridiculous watching this guy try to put a hot dog on the stick with his mouth. Fcuking GROSS! he gave us our dogs and my gf walked away for 1 min then i went back and told him i was not happy about the food and why and i told him that you should get this tank out of site. I told him i want my money back and he said no and that he couldn&apos;t give me back my money and that it cost him money for those corn dogs, so i told him i would like to speak with your supervisor and manager about this matter. That&apos;s when his face turned white and quickly punch open the cash register and gave me back my money.

I notice this lady and his son was about to buy something from them too. And i over heard the kid want to get some of those honeydew juice. I quickly interrupted the mother and told her&quot;look at that do you really want your son to be eating or drinking anything from this place?&quot;she thank me and drag her son away from the place. :cheesygri

Always check the health inspection signs. MrDisco Sep 2nd, 2008, 01:03 AM and its ridiculous watching this guy try to put a hot dog on the stick with his mouth.

wait wait wait. now the last time i went to the Ex was probably nearly 20 years ago so maybe things have changed a great deal, but are you saying they put hot dogs on the stick with their mouths? :confused: _Allan_ Sep 2nd, 2008, 03:39 AM I haven&apos;t read allt he pages - I&apos;m at 56 now - but wanted to toss in a couple more I&apos;ve learned.

When you call in to activate a Visa Card, and the person starts talking about &apos;insurance&apos;, hang up. By the time you talk to a human, the card is activated, and they are just trying to &apos;upsell&apos; you. - Also, a good portion are done here, in Toronto, at Yorkmills/Yonge by&quot;Vox Data&quot;.

Security Guards... be nice to them. One of the largest turn over businesses is Security Guards. The companies treat them like crap, underpay the guards in buildings, but pay the &apos;dispatchers&apos; $4-$5 more/hr then the ppl doing the actual work. I heard somewhere that Security in Toronto has a 60%-70% turn over rate, and most people quit after a month.
---
If you catch someone [not the police] writing your ticket, a security guard for example, they can easily &apos;void&apos; it - tell them to put a line thru the 7 or 0. 90% of the time, the tickets are voided as when your trained your told that is illegal (crossing 7&apos;s or 0&apos;s). This doesn&apos;t work if you get CofTParking Patrol as they use HP iPaqs / Dell Axims and thermal printers.
---
The photos that you get at the mall with Santa, do NOT cost much. The guy who did it last year [while I played Santa] told me the actuall cost for each photo for him was $3. But they charge what they do because Santa and the Camera man is paid hourly - also, all Santas are supposed to be screened by Police.
---
Salad Dressings. I worked at Seaforth Creamery where we made dressings. No Name, Presidents Choice, are made the exact same as name brand. Bluecheese dressings are made on the SAME LINE as other dressings - Creamy Cucumber, French etc., and they DO sanitize between EACH batch. Trust me, I have had my body inside the machines. They even sanitize the LABELING machine.

The eggs in the mayo, are dried, and the &apos;hermetic seal&apos; well, lets just say, when the machien stops working, humans do the tightening.
---
My friends mother used to work at WalMart. She always had a box of gloves and sanitizer behind the Customer Service desk.
People would bring used stuff back. One woman brougth one of those&quot;bathroom sets&quot;[toilet cover, bath mat, toilet mat] back with PUBIC HAIR in it. Another lady brought back a dress she&apos;d worn once to a wedding, and had sex in. She admitted that after my friends mother asked what the stain on the back was.

parking enforcement officers do indeed have a quota of parking tickets to write!


Don&apos;t say something you don&apos;t know about. Cops don&apos;t have quotas. They write ticket in the middle of the winter,because that&apos;s THEIR JOB. A bit of common sense would solve this riddle without my note...

I can verify that MLEO&apos;s - Municipal Law Enforcement Officers - do not have a quota. How? Because I AM a MLEO. I was given 5 books of tickets, and have up to a year before I have to retrain [my birthday in this case].

So stop hating on MLEO&apos;s and Security Guards. We&apos;re not out to get you, we&apos;re just doing our job. Firebot Sep 2nd, 2008, 04:50 AM I&apos;m not gonna bother with stuff from my own work since any info is confidential (I have access to a fair bit of info), but will mention something about my past roommate&apos;s work.

He&apos;s a plumber, and one of the jobs he had to do was in new renovated condo buildings in Calgary. He came in to clean some of the pipes as they were spewing brown water, but he noticed that the builder is simply rebuilding new walls over the 60 year old plumbing. Th building looks completly new and being sold off as such, but has plumbing dating back from the 50&apos;s. We are talking about completly rusted, about to burst pipes here, and these are being sold off as new condos. Apparently the building inspectors are oblivious to it or turning a blind eye, and my roommate mentioned that all the pipes need to be replaced, cleaning the pipes is just a temporary bandaid. It&apos;s not being done because the builder would have to charge an extra 50,000-100,000$ per condo. So they were just cleaned.

You know what happens when the condo building is finished and all units sold off? The builder runs off with the money, and any damages which happens afterwards is the condo owners responsibility. This is very similar to those condo buildings in Vancouver with leaky roofs, but it&apos;s happening right now. Guess who&apos;s going to be hit with all those plumbing and replacement charges after when the whole building has water problems? Not gonna be the builder ;).

Unfortunatly my roommate didn&apos;t care enough to do something about it. darkprince Sep 2nd, 2008, 06:28 AM wait wait wait. now the last time i went to the Ex was probably nearly 20 years ago so maybe things have changed a great deal, but are you saying they put hot dogs on the stick with their mouths? :confused:

sorry, he had a stick in his mouth and was trying to juggling with 3 hot dogs in his hands and trying to poke it through the stick in his mouth.

I know i won&apos;t be taking my future kid there s/he&apos;ll probably hate me when i tell him s/he can&apos;t eat this and that while we&apos;re there. Plus there is nothing to do there. Most of the rides are crappy and death traps and the only reason why i went there was for the international building where ppl were selling stuff. =D cheepino Sep 6th, 2008, 12:05 AM wow novacat2003 Sep 8th, 2008, 12:44 PM I used to sell hot tubs and pools. We have approximately a 15% discount we are able to offer you. The markup on hot tubs is much higher than on pools. Regardless of the time of the year, you can get this discount. Always. Buying in the Spring or Fall does not make it any cheaper. The employees get everything at cost, meaning a hot tub for say $5999.99 would be about $4100for us. heh

Not that interesting, but if you want a deal, be persistent. novacat2003 Sep 8th, 2008, 12:48 PM Oh, also, I worked at a piercer&apos;s before and the approximate cost price of any body jewelry (tongue rings, bellybutton rings etc) is 16 cents or so.

So don&apos;t pay $10 for it, when you can get it online for a LOT cheaper. graheel Sep 8th, 2008, 08:44 PM If 99 pages aren&apos;t enough, you can find some more &apos;secrets&apos; here:

Pushing 100, Disgruntledemployee Sep 8th, 2008, 09:50 PM I have so many things to say.

Usually that bar/restaurant that makes most of its money selling alcohol does not serve good food. Be careful, even if you only order fries!

When I was 14 I was illegally hired by one such establishment on Queen St. West (closed now). 1st duty was to get a garden hoe and remove the 2 inches of mold/food/??? that had accumulated on the walk in fridge&apos;s floor, yes I took it out in squares that I cut out using the hoe. Manager found mice crap in the sugar AND flour, just spent a day sifting it out. Rats and mice urinate when they defecate for anyone who doesn&apos;t know. Every sunday I was instructed to clean the NEW mold that had formed on the floor of the dry storage room in the basement. There was a leak and it was in the basement beside the keg fridge.

My absolute favourite thing about the unsanitary conditions. In the basement there was an old style drum potato peeler, beside set peeler was a stick. The only purpose for that stick was to hit the potato peeler before use, this would cause the cockroaches to flee from the main drum. Of course not all would run or escape before the potatoes went in.

It was a great 1st job experience. Paid $5.75 an hour except when my boss had no change, then 5$ an hour. I walked out when I was made to clean the unventilated bathrooms with pure bleach. They needed it no doubt but I needed my lungs more being so young and all.

There is more that went on but I&apos;m bored of typing now. Anyway, enjoy your fries! :) jason9945 Sep 8th, 2008, 11:52 PM I have so many things to say.

I hate those restaurants that dont serve food. Riflem@n Sep 9th, 2008, 09:42 AM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnXDCmIDscs deal_king Sep 11th, 2008, 06:07 PM I&apos;ve read your stories, but mine probably takes the cake. It is pretty shocking.

I live in Montreal and was traveling in the Middle East; using my MasterCard to take out money and buy things. At some point someone from my hostel stole my card and it took me a month to notice. I called MasterCard Security and they told me that someone had charged $12,000 to my card. (The guy had also done cash advances- so he knew my PIN number from cloning my card.) I asked them for a list of the things the thief had purchased, and went on my own little manhunt. After figuring out who the thief really was, I called back MasterCard Security with the guy&apos;s stats and name and they brushed me off saying that their own internal security was handling this matter and refused to take the info on the thief. I was baffled over why MC would ignore my help especially with nabbing someone who stole $12,000.

When I got back to Canada, I got my $12,000 back within 2 weeks. I spoke to my friend who works for VISA in the fraud department and what she told me had me in shock: MasterCard does not investigate overseas fraudulent purchases unless they exceed $65,000-$100,000.

The first reason is because MC/Visa make money on their brand ALONE, and from the sense of security people get from using their card. The minute people start reporting CC fraud to the police, they create fraud statistics which may eventually get published- and which in turn would make people less likely to feel comfortable using their cards. The sheer return on investment (in terms of branding) is such that MC/Visa will do almost anything (including swallowing massive fraudulent charges) to avoid having criminal activity publically associated with card.

The second reason why they don&apos;t investigate overseas purchases is because it is practically impossible. The sheer cost of cooperating with a police force in Asia to find the guy or to ask the Asian bank to send a picture of the guy who withdrew money from the machine- is prohibitive and amounts to well over $20,000. Short of sending their own investigators across the world, it is a lost and untraceable case for them.

So literally anyone can go to any machine abroad and buy a fortune in jewellry or take out $20,000 in cash advances over a week or so, and then claim that his card disappeared a week ago. Now when you read about those Russian mob credit card rings, you know how they make their money...
----------------------------

Before I go, I have another story which you&apos;ll find interesting. I was in the dressing room at Gap and I got a call on my cellphone from MasterCard.&quot;Sir this is MasterCard Security, can you tell us what your last purchase on your card was?&quot;After ascertaining that it was really MC and not some fraudster, I answered the question. She then asked if I still had my MasterCard with me, and I did. It turns out that someone had cloned my card and bought $8000 worth of jewellry and alcohol- including a $5000 bottle of wine at the SAAQ three stores down from the store I was actually in! So while I was in the Gap dressing room, someone was using my cloned card to buy a $5K bottle of wine a few hundred meters away from me!

Anyhow- the girl from MC assured me that she was cancelling and crediting the charges from my card and true-to-form- the next time I got my bill, I saw the charges and the corresponding credits. manixc Sep 11th, 2008, 10:09 PM I&apos;ve read your stories, but mine probably takes the cake.

- Jie deal_king Sep 12th, 2008, 07:30 AM To bring lube when in jail?

What my post also indicated was that anyone could go to a foreign country, use their credit card with a fake signature to buy $$$$$ of goods, take out cash advances, and then later claim their card was stolen and get the money refunded to your card. There is almost ZERO possibility of the credit card company being able to figure out it was you- especially if it took place in a third world country with low technology.

This is why those Russian credit card mob rings are able to thrive. I know its not moral, but its just a fact of life. Just remember that MC/Visa will flag accounts with multiple reports of card theft and cancel your account. So if you&apos;re ever going to report your card as a one-time thing, hopefully it should be for a a worthwhile amount. I don&apos;t think its the amount that matters, its the frequency. The_Madz Sep 12th, 2008, 10:03 AM in regards to the mastercard charge back.

knowing from experience with American express, they will charge back to the people who originally withdrew the money from the card, e.g the liquor store and or other places.

from my own experience, in the company i work for we normally deal business to business and thus dont bother with credit cards, one customer insisted he wanted the security and the points of using his american express.
we signed up for accepting american express and shipped the merchandise to him, got the tracking and confirmation he received it.
a few weeks later American express contacts us and says the buyer has disputed the charge saying he never got it and they are therefore doing a charge back to us. We protested and told them we had the receipt from ups saying he received it but they didn&apos;t care. After all, they had already credited the other guy and didn&apos;t want to be stuck with the bill. plus we didn&apos;t have an imprint of the card nor his signature to verify. hi_me_again Sep 12th, 2008, 01:09 PM I have worked both at the federal gov&apos;t and Ontario gov&apos;t; I have noted few observations:

Most francophone managers tend to hire/promote francophone employees. All this talk of equal opportunity is all b.s. Francophone employees in fed gov&apos;t do not care about Anglophones or any one else. They work mostly in Ottawa where most gov&apos;t offices are located, yet they will live on the Quebec side.

The federal gov&apos;t department spends a lot of money on consultants for preparing special studies/reports; yet nobody reads them. The reports either collect dust or get recycled or lost; again in a year or two, same reports are prepared by the same consultants. Each report is not cheap either. I think most reports are around $15,000 or less than $25,000. If they exceed $25,000 they you have to go through formal tender.

Amounts spent on perks such as traveling, meals, and drinks will make you go crazy. Just visit any fed gov&apos;t web site and look under Proactive Disclosure

Ont government; more or less same but on a lesser extent. Favoritism and nepotism are rampant. Normally there is formal hiring process, yet occasionally you will receive e-mail saying so and so is starting today...
makes you wonder how and when the hiring process started.


Overall, I think 40% of the workforce at both level of government is useless... HBP Sep 12th, 2008, 09:17 PM What my post also indicated was that anyone could go to a foreign country, use their credit card with a fake signature to buy $$$$$ of goods, take out cash advances, and then later claim their card was stolen and get the money refunded to your card. There is almost ZERO possibility of the credit card company being able to figure out it was you- especially if it took place in a third world country with low technology.

MC/Visa wouldn&apos;t take that much of a hit in loss and have liaison with their department in that country. If this was true, then fraudster would be all of this and fraud would be rampant.


I&apos;ve read your stories, but mine probably takes the cake. It is pretty shocking.

I live in Montreal and was traveling in the Middle East; using my MasterCard to take out money and buy things. At some point someone from my hostel stole my card and it took me a month to notice. I called MasterCard Security and they told me that someone had charged $12,000 to my card. (The guy had also done cash advances- so he knew my PIN number from cloning my card.) I asked them for a list of the things the thief had purchased, and went on my own little manhunt. After figuring out who the thief really was, I called back MasterCard Security with the guy&apos;s stats and name and they brushed me off saying that their own internal security was handling this matter and refused to take the info on the thief. I was baffled over why MC would ignore my help especially with nabbing someone who stole $12,000.

When I got back to Canada, I got my $12,000 back within 2 weeks. I spoke to my friend who works for VISA in the fraud department and what she told me had me in shock: MasterCard does not investigate overseas fraudulent purchases unless they exceed $65,000-$100,000.

The first reason is because MC/Visa make money on their brand ALONE, and from the sense of security people get from using their card. The minute people start reporting CC fraud to the police, they create fraud statistics which may eventually get published- and which in turn would make people less likely to feel comfortable using their cards. The sheer return on investment (in terms of branding) is such that MC/Visa will do almost anything (including swallowing massive fraudulent charges) to avoid having criminal activity publically associated with card.

The second reason why they don&apos;t investigate overseas purchases is because it is practically impossible. The sheer cost of cooperating with a police force in Asia to find the guy or to ask the Asian bank to send a picture of the guy who withdrew money from the machine- is prohibitive and amounts to well over $20,000. Short of sending their own investigators across the world, it is a lost and untraceable case for them.

So literally anyone can go to any machine abroad and buy a fortune in jewellry or take out $20,000 in cash advances over a week or so, and then claim that his card disappeared a week ago. Now when you read about those Russian mob credit card rings, you know how they make their money...
----------------------------

Before I go, I have another story which you&apos;ll find interesting. I was in the dressing room at Gap and I got a call on my cellphone from MasterCard.&quot;Sir this is MasterCard Security, can you tell us what your last purchase on your card was?&quot;After ascertaining that it was really MC and not some fraudster, I answered the question. She then asked if I still had my MasterCard with me, and I did. It turns out that someone had cloned my card and bought $8000 worth of jewellry and alcohol- including a $5000 bottle of wine at the SAAQ three stores down from the store I was actually in! So while I was in the Gap dressing room, someone was using my cloned card to buy a $5K bottle of wine a few hundred meters away from me!

Anyhow- the girl from MC assured me that she was cancelling and crediting the charges from my card and true-to-form- the next time I got my bill, I saw the charges and the corresponding credits.

Damn I agree. Thats just plain bad what he said he could do....And I think he probably already has done it&gt;:( :-0 :-0 :-0

While I do agree lots of things we do aren&apos;t exactly the&quot;righteous&quot;, as a customer/consumer, I think if the provider doesn&apos;t close up any potential gaps in their system, then they are simply allowing losses to themselves.

If this really cost credit card companies so much $, they would put in safe guards already. Just like cc fraud. There are tons of security features they could put into our cc cards to stop it. But they don&apos;t. Because they earn tons of money from the high interest rates that more than covers their losses. Lots of interviews on tv with these companies already shown us this is true. DVDManiac Sep 13th, 2008, 11:02 AM Do you work in ChinaTown or something? :confused:

Well, it really doesn&apos;t matter where I work in the organization, I started in Burnaby and it was predominantly Chinese. fantom Sep 13th, 2008, 06:03 PM Charges from the&quot;old&quot;card are transferred to the&quot;new&quot;card - you have the same account with the credit card providor. Whether or not you choose to identify these charge as legit or fraud once the transactions are batched and sent to the bank, will be up to you. given the point of this attempt, I suppose you would choose to dispute he charges as fraud.. which when I stop to think about it, is about as fraudulant as yourself making the transaction in the first place!

If you choose to go the route of&quot;damaged&quot;, you&apos;re still SOL, since charges will still appear on your account.

read below.


charges are NOT transffered if you report the card LOST or STOLEN. they will in this case give you a new number.

charges ARE transferred if you just ask for a new card because you wore the old one out. they will in this case print a card with the same number.

correct.


you don&apos;t have to cancel a credit card to do it. just get a prepaid visa or mastercard, then spend all the money, then use the empty card.

and correct again.

There are variables that can change who pays for the loss (the merchant or the credit card company), but in the case you mentioned above, it would almost always be the store that takes the loss.

The GENERAL rule, is that if it is a card not present transaction (e.g. internet, no signature, telephone transaction etc.) it will be the store/business that takes the loss if there is a fraudulent transaction. That&apos;s why many websites are so strict about the billing address matching the shipping address and try to verify everything since they&apos;d take the loss if there was fraud.

In most cases, if a signature is obtained and the card is present, the credit card company takes the loss if the transaction is fraudulent. oldskool75 Oct 10th, 2008, 02:48 AM you don&apos;t have to cancel a credit card to do it. just get a prepaid visa or mastercard, then spend all the money, then use the empty card.

I recall hearing on the radio this last summer that they were addressing this (soon?) in the GTA.. jcg1545 Oct 10th, 2008, 01:58 PM If you complain at KFC that your chicken is &apos;too greasy&apos; they will just put in in the french fry fryer for a minute to crisp the outside to get rid of the &apos;sogginess&apos; .. you now have MORE grease than before.

Mini carrots in cello packs are NOT mini carrots. They are full sized carrots (they need to grow full size to get some flavour) that are too gnarled to sell so the are cut and shaved down to mini carrot size. (Waste goes to animal feed)

take that one step farther, they use carrots that are past there prime and scrape them down till they get to the good part Frankie3s Oct 10th, 2008, 10:05 PM To bring lube when in jail?

Don&apos;t got any secrets myself but just wanted to bump

:arrowu: Sgt_Strider Oct 17th, 2008, 02:51 AM When i use to work at Candy Time @ CNE we use to sell all we possibly could have.

For example, one time someone came back to us cuz they dropped their candy apple, we exchanged it and I was told to just wash it and wrap it back up. The ice we used usually had tiny pieces of dirt in it. When i saw a wasp in one of the cotton candys and told the manager, she told me to sell that bag next, and when one of the other co workers cut their fingers, she was still told to make the cotton candy(we didn&apos;t have gloves) so blood got into the candy.

I was only there for three days and i reported them but i don&apos;t think anything was done =/... oh well buyer beware :)


I use to work at the PNE in Vancouver and a co-worker once told me something similar. amana Oct 18th, 2008, 01:00 AM Most store brand and name brand items are made by the same company.

yah, i remember watching a consumer show on tv about this. Sometimes large chain stores have their own brand of AA batteries, but it&apos;s actually made by Energizer/Duracell. So you might actually be getting the same battery but at a different price. brownie17 Oct 19th, 2008, 09:36 PM hi, just got through this thread in its entirety (after 4 days...)

here&apos;s my addition:

Back in high school I worked as a receptionist for a dentist in Scarborough (he&apos;s still around...his office is at the bottom of a condo building...) My disdain for dentists stems from my experiences with this guy! Whenever insurance companies were involved, he would do 2 things to increase his revenues:

(a) charge for 2 units of time when he really only spent 1 unit, or 3 units when he only spent 2, etc. 1 unit = 15 minutes. This I know of directly because the total # of units he charged for the whole appt often added up to much more than the total length of the appt!
(b) charge for things he didn&apos;t do and/or did, but wasn&apos;t really necessary, but did anyways because it was covered under your plan. I never witnessed this directly, it was the dental hygenist/assistant that would complain about this to me (since she was actually present during the exams and had the technical expertise to know what he was and wasn&apos;t doing in there)

I don&apos;t think this sort of abuse is the&quot;norm&quot;in the industry....this was just a particularly slimy cheap-bastard. Come to think of it.....maybe he was just an early RFDer.. :idea:

On another note, very often he would bring fish for lunch or dinner, and would microwave it in the kitchen area at the back of the office. Needless to say, it didn&apos;t smell pleasant!!! VERY OFTEN I would have to make excuses for the smell when a patient walked in, oftening blaming the stores next door and apologizing profusely!!

God I hated that man. Two of my friends were also receptionists there and we shared many many laughs at his expense....heck, we even declared our hatred for the man in our grad comments in our last yearbook! lol. brownie17 Oct 19th, 2008, 09:38 PM By the way, in reading the entire thread, i saw&quot;PM&quot;in the context of a Staples store referred to many times.....but I couldn&apos;t figure out what PM stood for???

price match rfdrfd Oct 20th, 2008, 12:12 AM Ah, dentists charging for more things just because its covered by our dental plan is very common. Esp. Asian dentists (and India dentists I heard). Asian dentists even ask you to sign the insurance claim form before you even sit into the chair.

There&apos;s tons of fraud in the dentist industry. There&apos;s a task force for a few years to look into this, but good luck to them.

Just like Doctors&apos; opening up their own cataract clinic, charging patients $100 fee, and billing OHIP as well. Same with colonoscopy clinics as well.

Well my first and only job is Mc Donald so I&apos;ll contribute some info:
-we change our oil every two weeks but filter it through some magnesium powder that turns to some brown hard stuff every day, usually make the new people clean it lol
-we never received any training on how to put less fries in the box in fact we are encouraged to push the fries into the box to get more in
-we do wash our hand after we touch meat and this is well enforced especially by me the team leader
-to clean the grill we use some clear yellow stuff that smells horrible but instantly cleans all the black stuff on the grill
-please do not order large amounts of food during closing we are people too and wish to go home and sleep please be considerate as during almost closing we clean and package most things that could be reused such as pickles, sauce.
-we do not do background checks on your references but why would you lie to get a job at McDonald lmao
-24h McDonald are pretty dirty compared to the ones in the malls because they do not close and have little opportunity to be cleaned.
feel free to ask me any more question as I hate my job and do not mind giving out info people want to know as long as I do not get sued lmao Hugh Jass Oct 27th, 2008, 08:11 PM feel free to ask me any more question as I hate my job ..........

cause the hours are extremely flexible as I can practically make it to what ever I want and as a student that&apos;s important to me.

Thirdly my pay is decent and better then most other places would pay as I&apos;m team leader about to be promoted to manager in about half a year which looks good on my resume.

When do you guys brew new coffee? Do you wait till the existing coffee is finished, even if it is 4hours later? Is there a set time when the coffee is poured out and a new batch is made.

And why is there always a freakn&apos; line up at the drive-in and inside????? There is so many people working inside, and yet, orders take forever to show up. Is it because you guys make everything to order? themagekiler Oct 27th, 2008, 09:10 PM I work at a Mcdonalds in a mall and there&apos;s a lot of older people who order coffee constantly so coffee is usually pretty fresh during the rush but during the night hours the pot that was brewed at 7pm usually last till closing, to answer your question in short not there is no set time to dump coffee in the McDonald hand book that I have. May be different at 24h places or corporate cause my store is a franchise.
As for waiting times at my store if I&apos;m working we usually have a burger done in 30 seconds for bigger orders usually no more then a minute if were not waiting on the fryer due to a incompetent person dropping the food not dropping enough. so we do assemble the order when people order the food but we should have enough food so that people don&apos;t have to wait for food to be cooked but it does usually happen during the rush and big orders come along
Our service time should be no more the 10min per visit I think not entirely sure... and we do have mystery shoppers every month that grade us on speed and quality and if a store does not make the mark over and over again the franchise could be taken away from the owner. themagekiler Oct 27th, 2008, 09:28 PM Is there anything in particular that you would suggest people don&apos;t order at McD&apos;s?

That chili story gives me the creeps too... Not that I know of all of our products come in frozen and after we fry,grill, we serve it as is with the condiments of your choice. It&apos;s all typical fast food. We do waste or get to eat any left over food and nothing is kept except for pickles, sauses (mayo,ketchup,tartar,etc) cheese, which are refrigerated.

thx for the response. If I ask for you guys to make a fresh pot, will you guys do it? sometimes I ask for coffee at the weirdest times.

my only beef is with the waiting time, 10 min per visit is a lot?? that does explain the lineups, there usually is like 5 people in front of me, and it takes about 20minutes before I get served. sillysimms Oct 27th, 2008, 09:44 PM That chili story gives me the creeps too...

Now that I think about it it&apos;s more like 6min maximum waiting time your right 10min is way to long but 6min is for like big orders a typical combo would take 2-4min from start to finish though depends as the person may have to brew coffee if it&apos;s almost out,drop fries in the fryer etc.
As for the coffee thing it may depend on the manager though they probably will honor your request if it&apos;s a 24h McDonald but if it&apos;s one that closes at 9pm they probably would not waste a pot of coffee that&apos;s not gonna get used and thrown out for one customer. It takes about 5-10min for a fresh pot of coffee. themagekiler Oct 27th, 2008, 10:22 PM Just found my managers book for service times:
Sandwich assembly from start to finish is 45 seconds
service time at front counter is 60s or less (time order to completion)
drive thru service time is 45s or less
total experience time 3min and 30s or less
Though as I said it varies as sometimes there are other extra duties while in the front, (change spoons for coffee,fries, refill fries ice cream machine, drop dries in fryer, stock up sauses, clean up,lobby check, change napkin dispensers). kimierin Oct 29th, 2008, 03:21 PM Love the thread!

for dents and etc, just hammer it out to its general shape and slap on 2 part putty/body filler. Easy and quick job, but not the greatest.

Ive heard stories that some body workshops tend to stuff newspapers on holes and stick in 2 part puddy, to cover the holes and etc.

This is a secret and a whole crap load more of stories to tell you guys, but I dont want to get ratted on. lol, so yeah, when you guys get into a collision, make sure you go to a garage that your friend owns or a huge franchise so they do the actual work and give you the work that you paid for.

This works best if the piece (e.g. fender) was supposed to be replaced but was repaired instead. However, it&apos;ll also show the difference in a bit of putty and a lot of putty. When you inspect the car, bring a magnet, keep it hovering about 1cm above the area.

If it sticks well and makes a clear sound when it hits the body, you have a good repair. If it doesn&apos;t stick as well or if it makes a dull thud, you have putty. bmnb4tches Nov 4th, 2008, 03:17 AM we drink and drive and smoke in a very public place

no accidents, but it makes for fun times. _Allan_ Nov 4th, 2008, 05:02 PM I worked for a week with a collection agency .. I was 5 minutes later today, and was fired. So let me spill the beans on a few things.

1 - Deny you are who you are, and if they refuse to tell you what company they work for, you know it&apos;s a collection agency. Why? It&apos;s against the law for the Collector to disclose any information about the call to a 3rd party.
2 - Tell them they are hereby ordered to not harrass you anymore. They are not to&quot;skip trace&quot;you (that is, call neighbours, ppl with same last name, or place of employment. Send it in WRITING TO THEIR OFFICE (Collect Corp is 415 Yonge Street).
3 - Debt Collections in Canada arerequired to follow their Provincial Ministry regulations. They will call between 8am-9pm Mon-Sat, and 1pm-5pm Sunday. They also have to follow PIPEDA (Privacy&amp;Information Protection, Electronic Documents Act).
4 - If they offer you an early settlement - TAKE IT!
5 - IN Canada, they CAN NOT See your mortgage information, however, every agent can see your current Credit Score, they can also see your SIN/SSN, address, previous address, and a bunch of other information.
6 - NEVER ANSWER YOUR PHONE WITH YOUR NAME, just say&quot;Hello.&quot;and when they ask for you, ask who they are, and why they are calling. If they are evasive about the company (as noted above) tell them to stop calling your number. miss_swan Nov 4th, 2008, 06:10 PM I worked for a week with a collection agency ..

Interesting stuff ...

- I know that collections will also do computer automated dialling ... what can a person do about that?

I answered the phone at my friends place one time and I got an automated caller saying&quot;Hello! blah, blah, blah ... to speak to one of our reps press this number, if this is a mistake press this number ...&quot;and so forth.

My friend never paid his city parking tickets (evidently that was the source he says) and collections was after him over time.

I just hung up thinking it was a marketing call.

Curious, with the new Do Not Call Legislation, does this affect collections? I would think probably not. _Allan_ Nov 4th, 2008, 10:10 PM No, the DNC list does NOT stop collection calls. skewed Nov 5th, 2008, 09:03 AM I know the best way to avoid collection agencies.....pay your bils.

Sadly a lot of people owing would never consider this. _Allan_ Nov 5th, 2008, 02:01 PM Yes but some collection agencies just phone everyone up in the phonebook that have a similar name.

It&apos;s called&quot;Skip Tracing&quot;using a SLN (Same Last Name) and it is legal in North America, as long as 1 - the collector dosen&apos;t reveal the reason for the call and 2 - they only call the SLN once. _Allan_ Nov 5th, 2008, 02:19 PM Haha why not let collection agencies call I love them direct them to me... my parents got ETR after then because for some strange reason we own a Dark Colored Jeep when in fact the we don&apos;t.

Last time some loser called I googled his work place (Yellow Pages Building) while he was on the phone and told him I&apos;ll be there in 20 mins to discuses this face to face. He quickly quieted down real quick and stopped with the threats. That was 7 months ago.

The time before that I talked real slooow.

and prior to that I started to sing (and i suck at singing)

The best one is to repeat whatever they say.

The rule is NEVER agree to pay them any amount cause that resets the time limits - thus they can sue you ... they have 2 years to take you to court - after that they are at your mercy unless you say yes then the 2 year window to sue is reopened.

2 yr limit is a myth. If a person calls after 8 years and says&quot;did you go to such and such a college?&quot;you reply&quot;yes.&quot;then they ask&quot;did you get a student loan?&quot;if you reply&quot;yes,&quot;then you have reopened the case. abu_sme Nov 5th, 2008, 02:43 PM A collection agency is repeatedly calling me at 10:30 PM for a debt I do not owe. It all started when I changed my phone number. I have filed police reports and have gotten a court injunction against them but they still call me. Anyone know a good lawyer to take these guys to the cleaners? angekfire Nov 5th, 2008, 03:35 PM I worked at a Zellers for about 3 years. For 1 year I worked as a stock boy (So doing basically everything but cash), and for 2 I worked in the frozen/dairy section.

-You can return pretty much anything. A woman used to come in every month and return a 1/2 used bottle of shampoo. She&apos;d then buy the exact same brand/type, use it for a month, and come back and repeat. If the person at the service desk won&apos;t take it back, ask to speak with a manager, they will give you pretty much whatever you want.
-In the dairy section, we were told everything needed to be checked every day for expiry, but then told getting new stock out was more important than checking expired stuff. So if it was busy, sometimes I wouldn&apos;t have a chance to check for expired stuff.
-New stock is always supposed to be piled in the back with the older stuff in front, so if you are buying food, always check the date, and always buy the one farthest back.
-Sometimes we would get stock and they would just leave it on the floor as soon as it arrived. Sometimes it would stay sitting out for 4-5 hours, and even if things had partially thawed, we were told to stock it anyway.
-Employees would sometimes take mark-down tickets and print off a handful of extras, and put them on products they wanted as opposed to ones that actually were supposed to be reduced for clearance, then wait for their shift to end and buy them. Mulder and Scully Nov 5th, 2008, 03:43 PM Large retail companies often lose several trailers (referred to as&quot;containers&quot;) of product when it is boated over from China.

I don&apos;t know about that, but for my company it&apos;s often quicker and less expensive to have something shipped from China than it is from the U.S. Seriously. The Chinese want Canadian business. The problem however is in being able to find the product first and then there&apos;s still the quality control issue. tonyth Jan 1st, 2009, 11:26 PM One time when I was working at KFC this superviser dripped oven cleaner liquid all over the fryer and he pumped oil back in.

Those jets were escorted back by US fighter jets. After that, they sold all those jets.

Why did they do that? Their top management thought a world war was coming and the situation would become worse. i.e. they thought the outcome would be much worse than what we know now.

I can&apos;t because we cannot name this customer in anyway including admitting they are our customer. They are really straight about that. Our company needs to sign a contract to follow this (and many other rules). Otherwise, they can demand getting all the money they paid us. That contract went through the lawyers in both side back and fore for months in order to get that done.

We gave a code name for this customer just in case we accidentally talk about them in public (such as in a restaurant). All the papers that has their name in our office is either in a safe or be shredded. gman Jan 4th, 2009, 02:53 AM That&apos;s funny since Allan Greenspan THE freaking CHAIR of the FED had to hitch a ride on a Military tanker across the Atlantic since all PRIVATE JETS WERE ALSO GROUNDED - his envoy was left in Switzerland till 1 week later without the escorts&gt;enjoy the tin foil.

At least, he got his ride back home. That is what that matters.
I know (or I thought)&quot;everything&quot;was grounded. That is why when they told us about that makes that special. To be more specific, our eyes were popping out. gman Jan 4th, 2009, 03:28 AM I love how the 3rd line states&quot;International Bankers meeting&quot;you&apos;d think that those big banks mangers would be at the swiss meeting with the chairman - you should read that book cause it talks a lot about the shut down of America and how nothing was allowed expect the military and executive members of the govt - everyone else was locked out

I only know what I was told. I don&apos;t know the detail and how exactly the security detail was worked out. If their security (not security in terms of stocks) officer BS to everyone in the top management of our company for no good reason, that is the BS I know because of my work that others might not know. ;) bigredlemon Jan 4th, 2009, 03:50 AM 2 yr limit is a myth.

Care to back up that statement? ShopSmart Jan 4th, 2009, 03:04 PM I met a guy who worked at the Keele Valley Landfill in Maple On.
Crappy Tire dumped an entire truckload of&quot;defective&quot;49 mhz cordless phones into the landfill a few years ago. He told me the story that when the truck was out of sight, there was a feeding frenzy and everbody took dozens of the phones. He said he was able to make several good ones by combining good handsets with matching good base units of the same model.

So that&apos;s why we end up paying so much for garbage disposal via our taxes and now the stupid user fees.

What a f***ing waste to the environment. selpats Jan 4th, 2009, 03:14 PM Don&apos;t shop at ATIC, you will never win.

ShopSmart Jan 4th, 2009, 10:03 PM I&apos;ve seen that first hand. extra $$$ in the budget? new desks, carpet, lighting, desk accessories, etc. i watched them throw out perfectly good everything. stationary items (paper trays, pen holders w/ pens in them, gel wrist pads) went right into the garbage cause they were getting new ones anyways. i even got to help choose the new carpet.

This is a sign of low intelligence and utter disregard for 1. environment, the needy, and ethics.

I&apos;ve heard the same about some non-profit agencies and other companies/agencies funded by the government. The fact is that a lot of people have a low level of intelligence and are too lazy or complacent to either fight policies or expose them. Either that or they are afraid of losing their job. It&apos;s a little depressing to think of so many people choosing to do the wrong things and having so little regard for others. angekfire Jan 5th, 2009, 09:14 AM This is a sign of low intelligence and utter disregard for 1. environment, the needy, and ethics.

When I worked retail there was a story about an employee that was taking shelving units and stuff that they were throwing out anyway. When they found out, they fired hom for theft. Apparently, once it is in the garbage he would be free to take it, or if they had given him permission, but he took it before throwing it out.

I&apos;ve seen people throw out perfectly good clothing that just didn&apos;t sell for a while. It could have been donated, but then again, it would be them paying for stock that would be given to profit someone else. I would say who cares, but they are a business, they are in it for the money, and not to give away their stuff for free. havoc69 Jan 5th, 2009, 10:18 AM I worked 2 years in a POM bread factory.

Uh, I worked at CollectCorp, I did training, and this is what the trainer said, and demonstrated.
I have not done it personally, but he managed to snag one guy from UWO who hadn&apos;t paid on his loan for 20 years. Called him up, asked if he&apos;d gone to UWO, guy said&quot;yes.&quot;Trainer asked&quot;did you get a student loan?&quot;guy replied&quot;yes.&quot;and the trainer said something along the lines of&quot;Thank you for confirming that. Your case has been re-opened. You still owe several thousand dollars on the loan, and I&apos;d like to know when and how your going to pay for it.&quot;


TigerDirect.ca usually charges around 19% markup on retail prices.
If you want to get a GOOD deal with them, call their toll-free number, and create an account as a SMALL BUSINESS (they will then have the ability to adjust your prices, and knock up to 10% of the shipping costs.)

Also, according to my supervisor when I worked at TigerDirect .... CanadaComputers sells stolen goods. (I doubt the validity of this but ...)

I don&apos;t know about stolen, but for a long time (maybe even still?) Canada Computers was known to sell gray market goods -- skipping the legal, authorized and contracted Canadian wholesalers/distributors and going directly or close to the source in Taiwan, Hong Kong and etc.

Future Shop (even pre-BB), Best Buy, Staples and etc. all buy through Canadian or American wholesalers if not the manufacturer, and thus this adds another level of markup before goods hit retail shelves. rfdrfd Jan 5th, 2009, 12:12 PM I don&apos;t know about stolen, but for a long time (maybe even still?)

whenever u deposit cheques using the ATM machines, always entered the amount to an extra dollar e.g if u had 10.05 --&gt;11.05 or 10.61 --&gt;11.61. U will actually get the amount difference if it&apos;s less than a dollar or equal, i can&apos;t remember if it works equal to a dollar but less fa sure...so if u&apos;re lucky, u get $1 more into ur account...

i know bmo, royal and cibc does it, i&apos;m pretty sure the rest does it too...

This is true!!! I was an employee at BMO and I processed ATM envelopes - there&apos;s an&quot;Under 2&quot;category we used for the difference in the amount the customer keyed in and the actual amount deposited. So it actually had to be $1.99 or less. If it was $2.00 or more then we adjusted the customers account accordingly. selpats Jan 22nd, 2009, 04:08 PM This is true!!!

Is this actually legal? billyote Jan 22nd, 2009, 05:30 PM Is there a limit on how many times an account can do this? Could someone do it everyday?

When I processed ATM envelopes (over 5 yrs ago), these were for customers who genuinely mistakenly made a keying error. For example, a cheque was deposited for 55.35 but the customer keyed in 53.55. The difference of $1.80 would be put in the&quot;Under 2&quot;category and be &apos;written off&apos; at the end of the night after balancing the numbers. The customer would get to keep the $1.80.

So I&apos;m not sure how to answer your question - if there&apos;s a limit? Probably not. Could someone do it everyday? Probably.


*** On a side note, one of the ATM processors I worked with at the bank used this to his advantage. He ended up getting caught because all of his deposits had a difference of $1.99. One of the other processors there noticed he was doing this because of the name on the cheque and was eventually reported *** rfdrfd Jan 22nd, 2009, 10:23 PM PM someone and let them post it :-0

hehe, reminds me of an episode from Frasier. Frasier wants to tell Niles about a patient, but can&apos;t due to patient/doctor confidentiality. Then Niles tells Frasier a trick:

What if it is the other way around? If the customer accidentally keyed in $1.99 or under in favour of the bank, rather than the customer. Would they credit the customer in those cases? I&apos;m assuming they do credit the customer, but just curious. kingrukus Jan 23rd, 2009, 02:55 AM some of this stuff is pretty crazy.

Yes, the customer would be credited. Hugh Jass Jan 23rd, 2009, 04:41 PM For example, a cheque was deposited for 55.35 but the customer keyed in 53.55. The difference of $1.80 would be put in the&quot;Under 2&quot;category and be &apos;written off&apos; at the end of the night after balancing the numbers. The customer would get to keep the $1.80.

I should hope so, his cheque was for $53.35. :lol:

I presume you got it backwards.

Why wouldn&apos;t it just be corrected to the right amount? deal_or_no_deal Jan 24th, 2009, 01:29 AM I will definately try this out! shplad Apr 28th, 2009, 05:49 PM Fascinating thread...(though I&apos;d love to see it expanded, as I can&apos;t stand hearing any more about the food industry)

I used to work in IT (Information Technology) for many years. I still keep up with current industry trends

I don&apos;t have any secrets near as juicy as some of the previous posters, but..let&apos;s see some people might not know.

Hard Drives
==========
A sales rep. from one of the largest manufacturers of hard drives recently admitted to me that
my suspicion about reliability was right. I said&quot;Doesn&apos;t it seem like drives are becoming less reliable every year
now?&quot;. He said&quot;yes, and that the increased (areal) density (amount of storage capacity per drive) was making it
extremely difficult to make drives as reliable as the old ones.&quot;He said he&apos;d seen some series of their drives in
which approx. 15-20% of drives were failing once they reached the customer.

Windows and Restore/Recovery CDs
========================
Microsoft&apos;s licensing arrangement specifies that if Windows comes installed on a computer, then a backup
copy of either the install CD or a recovery CD or similar (recovery partition, etc.) must be provided, or there is
breach of contract. Technically, that means breaking the law. Most of you know this, but we don&apos;t always remember
it can be a good bargaining point when dealing with used equip., PC suppliers etc. If you get a used PC and you
didn&apos;t get recovery CDs with it, you can try calling the vendor (HP, IBM etc.) and ask for one. If they tell you
they provided a recovery partition on the hard drive of the machine, complain that that is no solution, as it was
corrupted by a virus/trojan. They&apos;ll say it can&apos;t be possible, but in fact, it often is. Often, you&apos;ll get a free
Windows or Recovery disc.

Changing the Product Key
=================
Oh, on the subject of Windows, if you have already gone to the trouble of installing Windows XP, and you didn&apos;t
have a valid serial no. when you installed, you can change your serial no. after you install using Microsoft&apos;s tool:
the WINDOWS XP PRODUCT KEY MODIFIER. Think about that for a minute...


Negotiating without the Windows License
===========================
If you&apos;re buying a computer that typically uses Windows, you may be able to negotiate a lower price with the
manufacturer if you insist that it be shipped without Windows (or any O/S). That way, some people argue, you
shouldn&apos;t have to pay the license fee that the vendor pays to Microsoft for installing Windows on the machine.

NTFS
====
NTFS is really a joke when it comes to reliability and performance when compared with filesystems that come
with other operating systems. When you look under the hood, as some testers and programmers I know have, it&apos;s
really quite a joke.

Antivirus problems.
=============
Speaking of NTFS...A signficiant proportion of problems people experience with antivirus software results from the
fact that Microsoft won&apos;t divulge certain aspects about NTFS to A/V vendors. That means the programmers there
often have to guess how to implement certain functions. When they guess wrong, it can lead to data corruption,
system freezes, and other problems.

Cisco
======
Someone I know has shown me evidence that suggests that the operating system on at least some models of
Cisco routers has a memory leak so severe that it can cause some routers to intentionally reboot. Cisco reps.
denied the claim, even though the code that demonstrates it was shown to them. They claimed it was impossible.


Firefox
======
My own experience suggests that Firefox STILL has a memory leak that is severe enough that if you open quite
a few Windows, the system can, at times, run out of memory, even with 1GB of RAM. (We&apos;re talking 10 or 15
windows here, not thousands.)

Anyone else here work in I.T. have anything interesting
to share?


Shplad nobb Apr 28th, 2009, 06:09 PM Hard Drives
==========
A sales rep. from one of the largest manufacturers of hard drives recently admitted to me that
my suspicion about reliability was right. I said&quot;Doesn&apos;t it seem like drives are becoming less reliable every year
now?&quot;. He said&quot;yes, and that the increased (areal) density (amount of storage capacity per drive) was making it
extremely difficult to make drives as reliable as the old ones.&quot;He said he&apos;d seen some series of their drives in
which approx. 15-20% of drives were failing once they reached the customer.



This one I am curious about. I have never had any problems with older drives, but just recently I bought a 500gb 2.5&quot;WD and that started developing 3000+ bad sectors within a few months. My RMA&apos;ed drive also started getting ~20 bad sectors within a month (although not severe and still usable).

Are high density hard drives just less reliable such that you can get bad sectors more easily (considering that the more dense the data is, the more accurate the head has to seek)? What about the mechanical side of the hard drives...surely that has to be improving? Also, I dont suppose if you have any information as to whether there is an actual physical difference between consumer grade drives and more expensive enterprise grade drives? shplad Apr 28th, 2009, 07:11 PM Can&apos;t say for sure. I do know that the raw number of bad sectors is not necessarily indicative of quality, since
obviously, the number of sectors is much larger on modern drives than on older drives.

I do know though, that the drive makers, in their relentless race to the bottom (price-wise, for those of you
not familiar with that expression) are trying harder and harder to make do with less. 3 platters was earlier
reduced to 2 and sometimes now 1. They claimed that perpendicular encoding was going to be way more
reliable, but that doesn&apos;t always seem to be the case, now does it.

I did notice that Seagate a year or two back changed the terms of their five year consumer drive warranty
to stipulate fewer running hours on the drive per day.

Anyone have any thoughts/opinions/rants/raves on this?

I am not quite sure I understand why a hard drive with more density would be more prone to failure, if it is not because of the increasing difficulty of the head to more accurately read/write (more chance of bad sectors).

Perhaps the reason why newer drives are less reliable is not related to the higher density, rather, the fact that manufacturers are trying to cut costs in any way possible? darkprince Apr 29th, 2009, 08:40 AM FS/BBY

that&apos;s not really a secret though :) trinidolphin Apr 29th, 2009, 11:49 PM Toronto has placed a bid to host the 2012 Wrestlemania PPV event!!! WHOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO... :cheesygri sh0n Apr 30th, 2009, 11:42 AM Might as well chime in with the good stories about where I previously worked.

Large national grocery warehouse (Platte assembler)
- They have dry, cold and deep freezer sections.
- All english muffins, muffins, and some bread were in the freezer section and they would be sent frozen to the store and left to thaw at the store and then sold there
- If we drop stuff on the floor we would pick it back up and try and fix the product and ship it back on
- We would even send in expired and moldy goods just so the stores can deal with it and it would also cut our costs down by eliminating wastes
- The people that work here and handle all your food / goods are by far the least educated ones out there. I think most of them either had some criminal record or is an illegal immigrant. Getting a job because of the turnover was&quot;that&quot;easy

3 Star Chain hotel lodge (Front Desk Staff)
- Guests would call in with the stupidest questions. We had to pretend to be nice and answer everything.
- The front desk staff is also a sort of concierge service and we can give you suggestions, directions and help you make reservations.
- We appreciate tips and seldom do guests ever tip the front desk staff
- The best rates you can usually get is the AAA or CAA rate. That or if you need the hourly rate (surprising this was quite rare)
- Since the hourly wage was pretty crappy we would try and find ways to make extra money on the side. Trying to up sell you to some of the tours locally or every time you exchange money at the desk.
- The best time to come in to check in for your room is after 1pm. By now the rooms would be cleaned. However we would usually give you either the room that is the farthest from the elevator or one of the nicer rooms it all depends on the front desk staff. If you are a late check in say 10pm then there would be very few rooms left and you are stuck with the best of the worst. So remember to check in early or in the mid afternoon for the best available room.

Nothing too juicy but those are some inks and bits from my previous work shplad Apr 30th, 2009, 03:40 PM BTW, I don&apos;t claim to know a great deal about hard drives, though I know a little. What you say makes sense.
Of course, data is written magnetically, so from what I gather, the problem is not as much mechanical as magnetic. I would GUESS that the more data on a platter, the stronger and more clearly polarized the magnetic charge of each part of the encoding must be (for differentiation from the neighbouring bits).

Apparently, even time (gravity, IIRC) can make the magnetic encoding originally on a platter weaker, so the process must be very precise.





Well the less platters a drive has, wouldn&apos;t that also decrease the chance of failure due to head crashes (less heads), and potentially reduce wear on the motor since it doesn&apos;t have to work as hard (lighter platters to spin)?

The District Managers keep them on a tight leash these days. gflux May 5th, 2009, 11:07 PM -You can return pretty much anything. A woman used to come in every month and return a 1/2 used bottle of shampoo. She&apos;d then buy the exact same brand/type, use it for a month, and come back and repeat. If the person at the service desk won&apos;t take it back, ask to speak with a manager, they will give you pretty much whatever you want.

wow your friend is feeding you lies.
I used to work there as a kid and its completely true... I can even tell you the process:
1. Your meat is cooked and put on a timer (90% of the time the meat will sit forrr way longer time that its suppose to) Thats why its the best to buy food when its busy.
2. The meat is put away in a holding container for 3 hours.
3. The meat is put into a freezer over night.
4. the meat is put to boil in the morning.
5. once its boiled its chopped up.
6. Its then mixed into the chilli mix and put to boil for 4 hours.
7. Its served to the customers. ricoboxing May 6th, 2009, 01:36 PM this is not really a secret, but if you ever need a personal trainer at a gym/healthclub, offer to pay the trainer cash, and you will save at least 25%

ie. personal training sessions used to cost $55?hr (10 years ago), I would only get $25/hr (minus income tax etc.). Sometimes clients would offer to pay me $35 cash, so I would take it. mcplar May 6th, 2009, 04:28 PM I can&apos;t because we cannot name this customer in anyway including admitting they are our customer. They are really straight about that. Our company needs to sign a contract to follow this (and many other rules). Otherwise, they can demand getting all the money they paid us. That contract went through the lawyers in both side back and fore for months in order to get that done.

We gave a code name for this customer just in case we accidentally talk about them in public (such as in a restaurant). All the papers that has their name in our office is either in a safe or be shredded.

I never worked in the Auto industry, but I can tell you there is a computer program called&quot;Alldata&quot;that will tell
you everything critical about your vehicle, including factory recall notices, and even warnings that the dealers
are told not to tell you about. Comes in handy when buying used vehicles, and during disputes with
dealerships/repair depots. Also useful for doing repairs, trade-ins etc.

Anyone else got anything to add about cars/the auto business?


Shplad jed May 7th, 2009, 10:32 AM Alldata are generic shop manuals, used for independent shops. They do not have current recall information although they do have some. They&apos;re alright.

May be different at 24h places or corporate cause my store is a franchise.
As for waiting times at my store if I&apos;m working we usually have a burger done in 30 seconds for bigger orders usually no more then a minute if were not waiting on the fryer due to a incompetent person dropping the food not dropping enough. so we do assemble the order when people order the food but we should have enough food so that people don&apos;t have to wait for food to be cooked but it does usually happen during the rush and big orders come along
Our service time should be no more the 10min per visit I think not entirely sure... and we do have mystery shoppers every month that grade us on speed and quality and if a store does not make the mark over and over again the franchise could be taken away from the owner.

Canada Computers was known to sell gray market goods -- skipping the legal, authorized and contracted Canadian wholesalers/distributors and going directly or close to the source in Taiwan, Hong Kong and etc.

Future Shop (even pre-BB), Best Buy, Staples and etc. all buy through Canadian or American wholesalers if not the manufacturer, and thus this adds another level of markup before goods hit retail shelves.

A while back i used to work with a chipset rep who was a manager at canada computers a long time ago, he told me the same thing as well and that the company was in huge trouble financially soon after because of the afore mentioned practice.....perhaps because of that situation, many of my managers at fs refused pms. When i would ask why, i usually got &apos;they are not authorized or they sell gray market stuff&apos; from a lot of the older managers.

I get a little cranky about this type of thing as I still have family in the business and these kind of way out comments can hurt my family&apos;s welfare.

When KFC Canada can not get enough supply from their main Canadian supplier (Maple Lodge Farms) the do have to import from the US occasionally. The US chicken tends to be &apos;stringier&apos; and internally the store staff has always chalked this up to a belief that the US chicken is brought to maturity faster through different hormone injections (you can see the injection spots on US meat but not on Canadian). Whether that is true or not I&apos;ve never looked into.

ALL the non traditional chicken products (burgers/wings/popcorn) come PREFROZEN and are not prepared on site (thus the fallacy of &apos;running&apos; out to get a cat or two).

Your family&apos;s&quot;welfare&quot;was gained off making people fat with greasy chicken. Chicken is actually one of the most healthy types of meat and KFC turned it into pure lard. I understand your not really very keen on people slandering your family&apos;s business, on the other hand that business has screwed so many people out of good health just because they are weak minded.

And harmful stuff most likely can&apos;t survive on moldy cheeese because huge part of this mold is fungus related to penicillin.

Probably he just knew what REAL cheese should taste like (feeling unfamiliar to those who never ventured outside of&quot;cheddar/mozzarella/Craft cheese&quot;realm). I mostly avoid processed&quot;sheetse&quot;myself not out of fear of bacteria but because it tastes bad. But moldy cheese... Well, bring it on!

Can&apos;t believe this would be surprising to anyone. Do other Tim&apos;s use bottled water to make icecaps, coffee, soups etc?

Coffee is allegedly made with filtered water. I do not know exactly but the water comes into the machine automatically through a pipe (employees do not pour in the water themselves).

The soup however is made using tap water. Most soups are prefrozen except for chicken noodle, which comes in power format. Prefrozen soups are heated and mixed with water, powder is.... well mixed with water and heated :lol:. Chili also comes prefrozen. mazdubb May 14th, 2009, 02:06 AM Coffee is allegedly made with filtered water.

I had the pleasure of trying some Smoked Blue Cheese at a pot luck party I attended. It was amazing. Nettles May 14th, 2009, 02:32 PM FFS when you get soup, it&apos;s boiled or heated so it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s tapped or bottled water. How do you think people in developing world countries clean the water in their homes? They boil it before using it and then cool it.

If you get an iced cap from the tap then it&apos;s okay to worry about that. Also, bottled water usually isn&apos;t filtered so your tap water is a lot cleaner. stevethewheel May 14th, 2009, 02:39 PM I had the pleasure of trying some Smoked Blue Cheese at a pot luck party I attended.

Not really. Authors make jack. Average royalty here in Canada is about 10%, and it&apos;s a function of selling price. The higher the price, the more royalty. Publishers could easily sell a book for $50 and still make ridiculous coin even after paying the authors, but why bother? The precedent for selling that intro math book is already at $150. Very lucrative industry. robster77 May 15th, 2009, 04:35 PM :evil: I knew it!!!

In just about every area (including Ontario) it&apos;s illegal to have a fire exit that&apos;s locked to prevent exit. There&apos;s pretty much only two legal options: a) Have a fire exit that is locked but automatically unlocks after the fire alarm is pulled (as long as a pull station is nearby), or b) Have a fire exit that will open after the bar has been pushed for x number of seconds (usually 15 or 30 seconds, in some places you can get a variance for a longer delay).

I worked in the kitchen at Tim Hortons from 2000-2002 and both the chilli and chicken stew came frozen, everything else was dehydrated. Things may have changed though as back then we actually baked as well, now a days the majority of the stuff comes frozen and is reheated. mazdubb May 17th, 2009, 03:46 PM I could have sworn that I saw frozen servings of chili in the freezer when I was working there last year... alongside some cream soups and some sort of stew (the only dehydrated soup that I am sure of is the chicken noodle soup).

It might have changed since you worked there. Right now, the chili and most of the soups are dehydrated when shipped to the stores. The only soups that are shipped frozen are the potato&amp;bacon chowder, clam chowder, cream of broccoli and the mixed veg. brunes May 17th, 2009, 06:22 PM I could understand different sandwiches, but for every sandwich, that is crazy.

I would rather have an employee who washes his hands before his shift handle my food than these ones I see with the plastic gloves on that literally wipe up the counter with the gloves and then handle your food. You don&apos;t think it happens? Watch these guys with the gloves closely sometime, look at all the crap they touch with the gloves at the same time as your food.

Plastic gloves don&apos;t do **** all to protect from germs. It is all hygene theater to make the public feel good. It&apos;s no different than all the BS you go through at the airport that does nothing to prevent anything and is really just a huge waste of everyone&apos;s time and taxpayer money.

EDIT: BY THE WAY - You aren&apos;t going to get sick from someone touching your food. Unless you plan on rubbing your sandwich all over your face and shoving the salami up your nose, i don&apos;t see how anyone thinks they are going to get another person&apos;s germs or viruses from something that goes into yoru stomach.

I&apos;ve worked as a part time butcher for the past 5 years and god so much goes on that shouldn&apos;t.

Tables never sanitized after something was cut on it (Example: Chicken will be handled on the table and than pork, and than beef).

Meat falls on the ground and gets put back.

I can tell you DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY BREADED MEAT AT GROCERY STORES THAT&apos;S MADE IN HOUSE! For example we ALWAYS sell breaded pork which is the pork that&apos;s cut goes bad on the counter after a couple days, we tenderize it bread it and put it back out.

Also I wouldn&apos;t buy medium ground beef, at least at my store we make it our self and it&apos;s all the scraps and bad meat at least we get our tubes of extra lean or lean and they don&apos;t look bad.

Gloves won&apos;t be changed often.

The supervisors were very insistent that the people doing the surveys must give a yes or no answer and not a skip the question or undecided.

You were also evaluated by how many surveys were completed and many people working would get people who did not understand english and still put the surveys through by putting words in peoples mouths,stuff like do you agree...ect and the person would just say&quot;un huh&quot;and not really a real answer.

Also Winners clothing store is not supposed to sell you any items without a price tag, they are suposed to be put away so that the correct price can be looked up somehow.
This was from the employee manual-now they hardly ever follow that policy though.

Apparently a lot of people steal from winners and put the price tags in the cracks of the fitting rooms.
The fitting rooms are also monitored by cameras.

Most scallops at the&quot;fresh&quot;fish counter are defrosted also unless the sign specifically says Fresh.
You are better off buying frozen seafood as it is cheaper also.

But that being said I did buy some actual fresh Canadian scallops last night at the fish store paid $10 for 200 grams,while loblaws defrosted scallops are around $33 lb:!:

Now I do not know about the other fishes as I have not looked lately.
Most of the fish in stores is also stored in a phosphate solution to preserve it better. This applies to almost all fish places, unless their sale tags specifically says&quot;no phosphates&quot;added then it is just stored in water I think.

Someone mentioned about the frozen bread being shipped to stores!
That is very funny as a few times I used to buy bagels at AP and they put them out frozen w the&quot;fresh&quot;ones and the frozen ones were actually w expired dates,lol!

I spoke to a friend of a friend-type family member who owns several Wendy&apos;s franchises in Quebec, who told me that was completely incorrect.
I remember quoting him old info I read here on RFD and he told me no, that&apos;s completely wrong. It&apos;s all fresh for the chili, its not dropped meat or second grade.

I worked at Wendy&apos;s as well when I was younger. Every store may be different, but where I worked here&apos;s how it went:

Any patty that was broken on the grill and not fit for going on a bun (split, etc) was put into a chaffing dish on the grill and kept warm.

When the chaffing dish would fill up, it would be covered and put in the fridge overnight.

Each morning, the previous night&apos;s broken patties would be chopped up to make chili.

No big deal - the meat was fine; not dropped, etc. Usually just broken and not fit for a burger patty.

I worked at Wendy&apos;s in Kingston many years ago as well, for about a year and it was the same at our Wendy&apos;s. We weren&apos;t allowed to put a burger on a bun if it was broken so it would go into a dish that was kept warm and then used for chili the next morning. There was nothing wrong with it, just not a perfect unbroken square for the burger.

Do your time.

- many times getting an NCRMD means a longer stay in the system than an actual jail sentence.

Once you do your time you are done.

If you are in the system it follows you around pretty much forever unless you manage to get an Absolute Discharge.

If I am not an Acanac subscriber for x months, can I sign up again at $18.99 a month? How about if someone else who lives in the house signs up?

Ya know, when the thread title asks for workplace secrets that others don&apos;t know, they&apos;re generally expected to be real secrets...:lol: Imelda_Acanac Dec 3rd, 2009, 12:11 PM A customer and household can only get it once.
Staff can access old files and check by name,
address, phone number, email, credit card, etc.
to determine if someone or a household has already
used it before. Although it is possible that some customers
who move, change phone and email, or have another
resident living in the same household pay for it, may
have been able to get it twice, but usually when caught,
billing will email them asking for the regular term price
to be paid or terminate service.

If they see sample spoons or sundae spoons on the floor they will reuse them...i have seen dead rats everywhere at the back of the store and even live ones ...i used to work there but could not stand the way they manage their business... is scary....the boss cant speak english.. the other 2 co-workers cant speak english... go check it out yourself.
I wish I knew this earlier. Baskin Robbins is so closeby that in the summer we end up going to this location for a cold/sugarfix. Not anymore.

About seven years ago I had a friend that worked at the Harvey&apos;s at the Hwy7/Mccowan location and according to him, there was a guy there that used to whip&quot;it&quot;out and stir the mayonnaise...and not with the proper utensil if you get my drift. I haven&apos;t been able to eat there since, though I&apos;m sure that guy is gone by now, but still.. Bookpreviews Dec 12th, 2009, 10:28 PM Might as well chime in with the good stories about where I previously worked.

Large national grocery warehouse (Platte assembler)
- They have dry, cold and deep freezer sections.
- All english muffins, muffins, and some bread were in the freezer section and they would be sent frozen to the store and left to thaw at the store and then sold there
- If we drop stuff on the floor we would pick it back up and try and fix the product and ship it back on
- We would even send in expired and moldy goods just so the stores can deal with it and it would also cut our costs down by eliminating wastes
- The people that work here and handle all your food / goods are by far the least educated ones out there. I think most of them either had some criminal record or is an illegal immigrant. Getting a job because of the turnover was&quot;that&quot;easy

3 Star Chain hotel lodge (Front Desk Staff)
- Guests would call in with the stupidest questions. We had to pretend to be nice and answer everything.
- The front desk staff is also a sort of concierge service and we can give you suggestions, directions and help you make reservations.
- We appreciate tips and seldom do guests ever tip the front desk staff
- The best rates you can usually get is the AAA or CAA rate. That or if you need the hourly rate (surprising this was quite rare)
- Since the hourly wage was pretty crappy we would try and find ways to make extra money on the side. Trying to up sell you to some of the tours locally or every time you exchange money at the desk.
- The best time to come in to check in for your room is after 1pm. By now the rooms would be cleaned. However we would usually give you either the room that is the farthest from the elevator or one of the nicer rooms it all depends on the front desk staff. If you are a late check in say 10pm then there would be very few rooms left and you are stuck with the best of the worst. So remember to check in early or in the mid afternoon for the best available room.

Nothing too juicy but those are some inks and bits from my previous work

I know that it is true that AP before they used to get the bagels,pita,breads that were frozen and place them on the shelf like that.
I&apos;d go in the AM some days and find EXPIRED frozen bagels on the store shelves lotsof times
This was back when they stilll had the&quot;fresh or free&quot;program.

The same AP location in ottawa they would also scrape the expiry dates on some food items and place them back.
I know so cuz I use to get a lot of fresh or free items as you could buy gift cards for the equal amount back then :):D

I actually called the food inspection about this and they were useless..so clueless too and was told to call back ect..

I also called Pilsbury and they sent someone from the company to check the store and also send me some coupons for my time (like 2 product coupons I think...)
I have never bought any baked goods from AP since then... ADRiiAN` Dec 12th, 2009, 11:50 PM EDIT: BY THE WAY - You aren&apos;t going to get sick from someone touching your food.

Really now? That&apos;s a huge lie.
Employee has a cold, employee wipes nose, employee makes your burger. Some employee&apos;s don&apos;t give a **** about washing their hands every second, or they simply, don&apos;t realize they just wiped their nose.

I understand about the gloves thing, but it&apos;s just another step in safety. Some people might have a small cut on their hand and not realize it, and still continue to make food. The gloves prevent blood from going in at least. jayisthebest88 Dec 13th, 2009, 12:23 AM That guy in the Roger&apos;s commercials who is always getting boned doesn&apos;t actually know he&apos;s on a commercial.

I don&apos;t think service is the key factor in hotels that charge an hourly rate. UrbanPoet Jan 6th, 2010, 05:20 PM A check at a bank really only takes 1 business day to clear!
At max 2 days... 3 days is rare (this is when volumes are high due to statutory holidays or due to unusually large volumes).

The 5 day hold they impose is just to mitigate risk! Because after 5 days the check will be 100% cleared through the system and any stop payments/holds could be weeded out by the clearing system.

Buy car wash at Location 1 - Wash car (or not) - write down code #
Keep ticket and take it to location 2 (same gas station brand) and ask for a new code. They&apos;ll give you one and take the old receipt.

Now you can wash your car once at location 1 and once at location 2 since you have a code for each. gretzky99 Feb 13th, 2010, 03:55 PM Buy car wash at Location 1 - Wash car (or not) - write down code #

Why would Station 2 give you another code? Won&apos;t they ask for proof of purchase? ie. your recipt with the code? When they see that, they will say&quot;that&apos;s not from my station, so i cannot give you another code for free&quot;.

This isn&apos;t unusual at all as most stores do this. Cookies are sellable as fresh for 4-5 days. Cakes and muffins 2-3 days. Tarts and brownies 4-5 days.

They take the old code (but they don&apos;t know he already washed the car in Markham) and they give him a code for the Mississauga car wash which he uses at that station next time he wants to wash the car.

Get it now?

If I was the Mississauga station cashier, I&apos;d say&quot;sorry, there is no way that I can tell you did NOT already use the code in Markham, since my car wash system isn&apos;t Province wide, hence, I cannot give you a new code, or you can simply go back there&quot; rfdrfd Feb 13th, 2010, 11:49 PM I&apos;ve always thought that the code will work at ALL gas stations of that particular brand.
So that if i bought a car wash at the Markham Esso, the code can be used at a Mississauga Esso? I could&apos;ve sworn i did a car wash at a different location using the same code...

I kinda assumed that when they give you a code, that code is now purposely activated for that machine (at the same station) for a few days/weeks. Expiry on the receipt.

Sort of like how a Gift card works. You can steal all the $25 Bestbuy cards you want, but that code ain&apos;t worth crap until they activates it in their system. 5dark Feb 13th, 2010, 11:55 PM Person buys a car wash in Markham.

JAGpilot, have you done this before? Bookpreviews Feb 14th, 2010, 04:44 AM This isn&apos;t unusual at all as most stores do this. Cookies are sellable as fresh for 4-5 days. Cakes and muffins 2-3 days. Tarts and brownies 4-5 days. If stores made and sold every pastry fresh every day, then there would be a lot of leftovers thrown out.

I know most bakeries keep some items like cakes 3 or 4 days ect...
but this shop is so small I thought they made items every 2 days or so for some anyways.

I know for sure the bread is made every day and also doughnuts, sandwiches.
but the owner only seems to make 24 doughnuts a day.lol
and maybe 40 muffins...

My buddy was at one of those restaurants and many of the other diners were either Chinese restaurant managers or owners. They all asked for paper napkins.

A week later, he was picking up stuff at an industrial laundromat and noticed that the workers just dump all the clean cloth napkins on the floor and pick them up to fold and pack after they made a small mountain of them.

How anyone could use a cloth napkin at a restaurant to wipe your mouth is gage indusing. :lol:

Looks to be an issue with the laundry company and not the restaurant. abu_sme Feb 19th, 2010, 04:57 PM Primary sector industries routinely pay bribes, kickbacks, and sometimes even ransoms.

But it&apos;s better then McDonalds, they don&apos;t have to wear gloves, which I find gross.

What makes a plastic glove any &apos;cleaner&apos; than washed hands? angekfire Apr 6th, 2010, 11:51 AM What makes a plastic glove any &apos;cleaner&apos; than washed hands?

1-If there is an open cut on a hand, a glove will prevent contamination
2-If the person forgets or chooses not to wash their hands, at least the glove is still cleaner from being kept in a box, probably away from contaminants.
3-Many people do not follow proper hand washing procedures, which is why so many bathrooms now-a-days have instructions.
4-If someone has an allergy and you need to avoid cross handling, it is easier&amp;faster to replace the gloves rather than wash your hands
5-If the person is wearing nail polish it could chip off into the food, which is kinda gross.

Just a few reasons. pfenix Apr 6th, 2010, 03:14 PM Hahaha I know which course it is because I worked there too, though I must admit, I never saw any of the listed activities occuring.

Anyone have inside knowledge about Subway or The Extreme Pita?

I eat at both of those quite frequently, due to the perceived cleanness.. so I want to know if there&apos;s anything bad about them!Subway has strict regulations about safety and cleanliness but I suppose it depends on the store owner/manager. I haven&apos;t heard of anything bad except a hair in a sandwich once. I eat from a Subway in Etobicoke all the time since I know the owners and have been in the back many times.

Cakes and muffins 2-3 days. Tarts and brownies 4-5 days. If stores made and sold every pastry fresh every day, then there would be a lot of leftovers thrown out.

My wife worked at a small, great cafe in Victoria where they would throw out their muffins, etc. at the end of each day and bake fresh in the morning. Instead of throwing it out, she started dropping the leftovers off at the needle exchange/AIDS clinic/homeless place on the way home. Sometimes she&apos;d drop off an entire cake. Everyone wins!

my contribution: I worked at a Pizza Hut in Oshawa twenty years ago (wow...) and it was the cleanest, strictest place. We would slice veggies fresh every day, and no funny business was allowed (we used to get in sh*t for breaking up blocks of frozen shredded cheese on the ground - even though they were double bagged and in cardboard). I also worked at one of Oshawa&apos;s finest restaurants (admittedly, not saying much), and it was disgusting. The chef used to smoke right over the grill, a coworker once knocked over a whole jar of peppercorns under the stove, which is a disgusting area, and he was told to sweep them up and put them back in the jar. And this was a $40/entree place.

You really can&apos;t judge a book by its cover... OnFiYa Apr 28th, 2010, 01:27 AM When i use to work at Candy Time @ CNE we use to sell all we possibly could have.

For example, one time someone came back to us cuz they dropped their candy apple, we exchanged it and I was told to just wash it and wrap it back up. The ice we used usually had tiny pieces of dirt in it. When i saw a wasp in one of the cotton candys and told the manager, she told me to sell that bag next, and when one of the other co workers cut their fingers, she was still told to make the cotton candy(we didn&apos;t have gloves) so blood got into the candy.

I was only there for three days and i reported them but i don&apos;t think anything was done =/... oh well buyer beware :)

I follow up on a lot of renovation jobs in the summer and when I have free time, there are stories from workers from all over the place; electricians mentioning how he pulls a lot of extra wires and outlets for&quot;extra output&quot;in basements and people questioning if there were suppose to do&quot;something&quot;, how quite would &apos;I&apos;/one might do it.

The most common story I remember was during the renovations on the restaurant below where one of the drywallers were mentioning how clean our kitchens were and how they have to be clean. One of the restaurants he did in china town had really old and moldy ceiling tiles and as he was removing the tiles he found rat sh.it on top of the tiles and below had a bunch of pots with food and whatnot in.

The drywaller told him that he needed someone to remove all the pots or they would have sh.it in it and the owner said&quot;don&apos;t worry&quot;insisting he would get rid of it. As he finished up the job he told me how the owner stirred it all and mixed it well together and I don&apos;t know what happened after


Finally, NEVER USE AN AIR DRYER after washing your hands. If you open one up, you will find feces on the blades. When people run the dryers, others are in the bathroom and the smell from their feces gets into the dryer and hardens. What is worse, I see people using these dryers to blow dry their hair. You can verify this by looking at the fan in your bathroom. It works similar to a hand dryer, except it sucks the air in, so it collects crap faster.

This is bullsh.t

You know how there&apos;s a saying when you flush you&apos;re toilet sh.t particles fly back in the air? Yes it&apos;s true, but the distance is less than two feet, unless you are taking a sh.t while you blowdry your hair then&quot;never using an air dryer&quot;is bogus.

We all know somebody who&apos;s chased down by creditors. Collections jobs are it seems in endless supply from all the turnover.

But, you&apos;d be surprised at the personal details they pull up. And not just from your current state/province. Oh and the accent.. some shady companies run collections across borders pretending they&apos;re in Texas or Calif vs Mexico/Canada.

Oh and be kind to the typical student on the other end. They just want you to make some minimum $10 payments on your account, so that they could move on to the next shouting lunatic - yeah they&apos;ve heard your excuses a million times, and believe me your&quot;bad day&quot;, is nothing compared to mind numbing verbal abuse and threats day in and out.

================

Not really a secret, but obviously 99% of stuff in Canadian Tire / Wallmart etc is Made in China. Typical $5-10 items are $1-2 in a dollar store.

And I&apos;m pretty sure everybody&apos;s figured out the&quot;regular&quot;price fix. Even Best Buy started doing it recently. To get 50% off special, instead of lowering price, raise the&quot;regular&quot;price. Expensive transportation, weak dollar, etc... most department stores raised prices across the board in last 12 months.

================

But, we still make electronics here in Canada, right? Celestica. MTS. AMD. RIM. Jobs in Canada are getting scarce. Only small-scale prototype runs are done here. All the big factories are in China (ie foxcon where iPhone producing workers are increasingly suicidal).

But, of course you don&apos;t ship your&quot;broken&quot;BlackBerry or AMD video card to China - it comes here. It gets investigated and added to databases of faults.
As you&apos;ve probably guessed, a lot of spontaneous unexplained high falls, liquid soaks and crushing impacts that customers expect to be reimbursed for.

The Ottawa hospital- the general location they used to store some medical tests on laptops.
And apparently they were too&quot;lazy&quot;to tranfer the files for a number of months.

The same dept, they also forgot to lock up the laptop and many weeks this computer was in an unlocked area near where the emergency dept was located before.

This laptop was stolen and it had thousands of people&apos;s tests,ohip numbers and medical info.

I doubt the hospital actually reported this to the police either-it think it was just internally reported.

I also received a letter at home about this as my info was on that laptop that was stolen.

I have this info on an actual letterhead from the hospital in my desk too.:lol:
So, even though this is not&quot;new&quot;news I&apos;m sure some media might be interested in printing it:lol:

I also spoke to someone who worked in that dept and they told me that they did not think someone would steal a laptop left in a public unlocked place.

I find it hard to beleive that&quot;they&quot;never thought someone would steal a laptop, cuz when you go far a x-ray they have all these announcements to keep your valuables with you to prevent theft.

they strategically divert big blockbusters from theatres that they know are going to be busy anyways, to theatres that get less traffic.

example being scarborough town centre. they will be busy on a friday and saturday night regardless of what movies are playing. in order to support other theatre nearby, they will not show some big movies that are released. it is not because STC Famous Players cant afford to purchase rights to show the movie as some people assume, they just choose not to.

That is partly false, its because they make deals with other theatres to get the big movies they want.

example is

blockbuster 1 and blockbuster 2 are comming out same year, the SCT Famous will want blockbuster 1 very badly and they will make deals with the parent company to hold it for a certain contract time frame and even what theatre it will play in. And offer other theatres blockbuster 2 plus a few decent movies to get the one they want.

Example is empire in square one and the cinaplex across the street. The empire gets the ****** movies because cinaplex distrabutor has arranged a deal to give all the good movies to cinaplex but the **** to empire while on young and sheppard the reverse happens since Empire considers that their flagship theatre they allow cinaplex to take all the movies in the mississauga location so that the empire on younge and sheppard gets all the good movies.

If you think im wrong go look up

The reason STC gets less good movies, isn&apos;t because they are close to other Cineplex (Morningside/401 is far, as is Eglinton Town and Fairview).

They are dealing with AMC there. I know this, as I&apos;ve worked at the STC location, and talked to the manager.

The movie DISTRIBUTER has final say on where the movie goes. NOT the theatre company. So, if Maple decides to place&quot;Spiced&quot;(for example) at STC for 6 weeks, then AMC will not get it. BUT They will also say&quot;Morningside/401 no, Eglinton ok, Firview no.&quot;because they want to spread out the movies.

When I worked at an IGA (Sobeys) in the early 90&apos;s, we use to just take all the broken eggs to the bakery department so that they could use them in production.

There was nothing wrong with the eggs (besides cracks of course) so why toss them out (the store did not get credit from the egg producers). Jaytee Jun 21st, 2010, 03:01 PM The coke machine at my work accepts Cuban nickels as dimes.

Shocking, but true. mbk.2k3 Jul 15th, 2010, 02:23 PM i used to work at Kumon (math + comprehension for kids) back in highschool:

the owner/head master or whatever would sometimes purposely try to slow down a kids progress to milk their family of their monthly fees. even kids with high potential would be slowed down a few times.

i actually did the opposite...gave some of the smarter kids advanced tests to move them on to the next level if i thought they were ready for it.

message for parents: closely monitor the work you child does at kumon/sylvian/private tutor. test their knowledge at home to measure their progress once in a while.

most likely an isolated case. abu_sme Jul 15th, 2010, 02:33 PM I worked in a certain electronics store that will go nameless. At my store, although I&apos;m sure it was systemic, outright fraud was pretty common. If a tag said $49.99 and it scanned up at $29.99 and had a $15 warranty we we&apos;re told to override the price to $34.99 and say that they were getting a free warranty.

Happened at at least 3 different stores I worked at, but it was very common within this company. If you try to guess the store I will neither confirm or deny any of them, so don&apos;t ask. frankyflwrs Jul 15th, 2010, 03:14 PM Won&apos;t tell you which brands but....

In order to save money in some places, they still serve food that they accidentally dropped on the floor. pintobean Jul 16th, 2010, 04:37 PM My cousin told me this story a couple of years ago, but I forgot to post it here...

During his last year of highschool, my cousin did a co-op placement at a food packaging company. I don&apos;t know the name of the company, but they were really cheap because every year they used to take on dozens of co-op placement students (free labour) and they also hired mentally-challenged people (to take advantage of some government program that would subsidize their wages).

One of the products that this company prepared was&quot;shredded lettuce&quot;which restaurants use in dishes like nachos, tacos and salads, and which fast food places like McDonald&apos;s use in Big Macs, McChickens etc...

Anyways, my cousin said that the heads of lettuce used to be chopped up, and then the shredded lettuce would be dumped in huge sinks of water. This was done so that the lettuce would be&quot;washed&quot;but also so that it would absorb water because the lettuce was packaged and sold by weight.

One of the disgusting things that my cousin witnessed was the mentally-challenged kids spitting and blowing their noses into the sinks of lettuce. He observed this happen multiple times in a day so he approached one of the kids and asked him why he was doing it. Apparently the kid just laughed and said that everbody else was doing it, so he did it too.

My cousin reported the issue to the shift supervisor, but the guy didn&apos;t do anything about it and acted like it was commonplace. He also reported it to his co-op supervisor at school, but they were so hard up to find companies that were willing to take on co-op students that he&apos;s pretty certain they didn&apos;t do anything about it either.

Since hearing this story I try really hard to avoid shredded lettuce whenever I eat out at restaurants and fast food places, but sometimes it&apos;s just impossible. Sorry if this grosses you guys out :o Hugh Jass Jul 16th, 2010, 05:13 PM We need brands, or it never happened.

Well, for starters, the poster could get himself sued for doing so.

While he may be telling the truth, getting oneself into hot water unnecessarily is stupid.

He posted some vague info, we can take it with a grain of salt as with everything else on the internet. There&apos;s no guarantee the poster was telling the truth to begin with. marcroboy Jul 18th, 2010, 01:03 AM the coke machine at my work accepts cuban nickels as dimes.

Also, if you are a hot or good looking chick, almost any type of retail store you go into, all (or most) of the guys will &apos;notify&apos; each other and will be eyeing you and checking you out.

If you go to watch a movie on slower days/time, chances are, they&apos;ll start the show (esp if its the last) several minutes early as everybody wants to go home earlier. Sure its trailers, but if you budgeted 15 mins after the official start time, it&apos;ll actually be 10 mins or less.

I&apos;ve had that exact sequence happen to me only once ever I think. It was at a Guess store I think at Sherway Gardens. The saleswoman showed me a pair of jeans, a zip-up sweater and t-shirt about a minute after I got into the store (of course she greeted me first and gradually showed me each item). Then when I was trying those on (surprisingly enough, everything she picked fitted me) and got me one more t-shirt to try on.

Well....assuming you don&apos;t grab your size 40 pants which have started to sag off your already plump behind, then proceed to prepare your sandwich...gloves are supposed to be a clean barrier between any bodily fluids/contamination and the food you are preparing.

However, fixing your hair, pants, shirt, sweat off brow with these gloves....KINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDA defeats the purpose.

I had to call a certain not-so-pleasant-on-the-eyes employee when they proceeded to pull up their pants before making my sandwich on that faux-pas. I was impressed I didn&apos;t just vomit right then and there :D., all I did was ask them to use a new pair of gloves. I said it just loud enough that EVERYBODY in line heard me :lol:. _Allan_ Jul 20th, 2010, 12:13 AM When you watch an analogue film, every 17-23 minutes (somewhere in that time) you&apos;ll see a red circle flash VERY BRIEFLY at the top right of the screen.
THIS is a warning sign from the &apos;old days&apos; when they had two projectors running, and was a&quot;10 meter&quot;warning. That meant, there was only 10 meters of film on the reel and to start the other machine, so the next reel would be going and synch perfectly.

NOWADAYS ... it&apos;s still there, but, most modern places (AMC, and Cineplex) have platters. They take the 5-9 reels (20min/reel x 5 = 100 min or 1hr 40 min) and &apos;build&apos; the film onto a large platter (around 6&apos; diameter).

Also, there is usually only 1 projectionist Mon-Thur from opening till 6pm then 2 people to run a 12 theatre projection room [which is just one massive room with the projectors &apos;offset&apos;].

At a theatre like The Varsity, when you walk down the hall between Cinema 2-8 you&apos;re walking under several TONS of camera equipment.

if you see a person carrying a hexagonical shaped metal box ... they are carrying reels of multibillion dollar film.

TheFinalWord Jul 20th, 2010, 05:37 AM When sending your kids off to camps for the summer, think of these little tidbits:

1. The juice is typically mixed in garbage cans (that have never been used for garbage) and then poured into jugs to be sent out. When they come back, the juice is dumped back into the garbage cans. Sometimes, there are napkins, leftover food, etc. in the jugs and this gets dumped into the garbage cans. It is then taken out with a strainer and the juice is reused. Typically, the lids for the cans are not used, so you&apos;ll drop meat or whatever into the juice and just take it back out.

2. Most food goes out on larger platters and is not individually plated. When it comes back, it is reused. Spaghetti today is chicken noodle soup tomorrow. Carrots and green beans today goes into stew tomorrow. And it doesn&apos;t matter the condition it comes back in...it gets reused.

3. The staff are sometimes not too bright. Since the kitchen staff eats the same food as the kids, there is an incentive to not mess with it. Unfortunately, I&apos;ve witnessed people sitting bare- ***** on the pizza dough or dropping it on the floor for fun. It&apos;s not as much fun when you don&apos;t know which pizza&apos;s have had the special treatment.

4. We had a guy cut his hand on the metal rims of the large ice cream containers. It was a cherry ripple or something like that and he got blood in it. Most was removed, but I&apos;m pretty sure not all of it was.

5. There is a network between the camps, so once the inspector shows up at the first camp, all the others are aware. We are sent into the fridge to cover everything and clean up quickly so we can pass the inspection.

6. Strict kosher is likely not happening at Jewish based camps.

7. Mice get into everything. Never witnessed much of an issue with cockroaches, however. angekfire Jul 20th, 2010, 08:40 AM Makes me happy I never went to camp. _Allan_ Jul 20th, 2010, 09:27 AM When sending your kids off to camps for the summer, think of these little tidbits:

I&apos;m not entirely sure if you&apos;re referring to overnight camps, day camps or just in general but I currently work at a day camp and we definitely have the proper procedures as to dealing with the food. The food gets dumped at the end of the day and is not reused.

The juice thing doesn&apos;t happen there either since the place I work at usually buys cartons/jugs. The one/two time(s) I saw them mix from concentrate it was done in the jug or cooler.

It&apos;s never ALL camps. It&apos;s never ALL restaurants or grocery stores or whatever. I worked at 2 camps in Northern Ontario and 1 camp in Haliburton/Algonquin and things were very similar at each.

The food from the plates is tossed, but the food from the main serving dish is what is reused. klover Jul 20th, 2010, 11:23 PM Here&apos;s one.

At the futureshop location which I used to work for, returns come back as open box units. But sometimes when managers get annoyed at the large amount of open box items we had to get rid of, we would&quot;clean up&quot;some of the nicer ones and sell them as&quot;factory fresh&quot;

Found this out the hard way with a&quot;new&quot;HD-DVD player. Manager saw me coming back to the store next day and pulled me aside and immediately gave me an actual, NIB unit.

I fille dout that survey thing at the bottom of your receipt and left a few nasty comments about the store, cleanliness ect.

Manager calls me back a few days later and says that sometimes in the chip aisle and cracker aisle customers put fruit and things that need to be refrigerated and staff only find out later and that&apos;s why there is fruit flies.

- they don&apos;t have a quota, but if they aren&apos;t issuing tickets then the supervisor will ask wtf is going on
- some officers are nice and will give you warnings
- if they chalk your tires, just move your car up to the next curb and you&apos;ll be fine.
- if you park your car in a tow zone, your car will be towed probably instantly. the officers have a duty to do patrol in these zones from 4-6 (which is when they&apos;re usually active due to the rush). so if you leave your car there for 2-3 minutes, it will likely be gone. if you come back and they&apos;re in the process of towing it, you&apos;ll have to pay the tow truck a&quot;drop fee&quot;which will depend on what he feels like charging you. he doesn&apos;t have to charge you a drop fee and can just tow your car away if you&apos;re rude. be polite
- if a car gets 3 tickets (or 5, can&apos;t remember) it can be towed. it&apos;s up to the officer. (i believe this was all-time and not in a certain matter of months, eg. in the past 3 months)
- if the officer sees a ticket on your windshield, you can still get another ticket
- school zones are watched like a hawk once school is done
- if you&apos;re in your car, you can still be issued a ticket. just because you can&quot;move it if there&apos;s a fire&quot;doesn&apos;t mean you should be standing there
- if your car doesn&apos;t have a license plate, you will be issued a ticket through the VIN#. these tickets do not have to be paid.

that&apos;s all i can remember for now petitallegra Jan 17th, 2011, 10:06 PM Because here is the recipe!

Its just Bisquick mix, with about 2 Tablespoons of garlic powder in the mix, and a sprinkling of parsley flakes. After they are done baking, you pour a mix of melted butter and garlic powder on top, while they are still hot.

Comes out perfect everytime, and you don&apos;t have to ask for extras at the restaurant, and try to sneak them home :razz: antigua1999 Jan 18th, 2011, 12:05 AM If you need to call a help desk or customer service and have the option of french or english press french, you are almost certain to get a call centre in north america versus one overseas. This way you can get an english speaking person, and not somebody from another country that dosen`t speak very good english. Mykester Jan 18th, 2011, 12:09 AM Because here is the recipe!

I do this anytime I need to call Rogers, works like a charm! Kherani Jun 2nd, 2011, 10:10 PM I do this anytime I need to call Rogers, works like a charm!

Rogers doesn&apos;t use overseas call centers. originalnutta Jun 2nd, 2011, 10:22 PM There are actually a lot of hard workers at Canada Post. Sure there are some lazy doggers who think the world owes them a favour, but that&apos;s in any job. But for the most part a lot of people do their work and realize how fortunate they are.

They don&apos;t add cheddar? Even though they call it cheddar bisquick? eldiablo Jun 3rd, 2011, 07:07 AM Yellow Media’s (owns Yellow Pages which ows RFD) stock has fallen 40 per cent in the past six months, including 20 per cent in the past two weeks alone. originalnutta Jun 3rd, 2011, 12:19 PM Did you read the thread title?Yeah, sure did.

Are you sure? Two of the last retentions people I spoke to were clearly not Canadian and had trouble conveying their words. nalababe Jun 3rd, 2011, 06:38 PM Are you sure? Two of the last retentions people I spoke to were clearly not Canadian and had trouble conveying their words.

You mean just like Markham??? eldiablo Jun 3rd, 2011, 06:49 PM yes, just like Toronto (Leaside).:lol: bullionaire Jun 3rd, 2011, 07:32 PM Are you sure? Two of the last retentions people I spoke to were clearly not Canadian and had trouble conveying their words.

Call centre in RHill and massive one in Brampton AKA Bramladesh. Sounds like you didn&apos;t get one on the east coast... Nook Jun 5th, 2011, 03:11 AM You mean just like Markham???
Nah, we&apos;re pretty awesome up here.


Call centre in RHill and massive one in Brampton AKA Bramladesh. Sounds like you didn&apos;t get one on the east coast...
Yeah the Brampton part probably explains it. There was a lot of static on the line as well, so I figured maybe it was a non-domestic call. lead Jun 5th, 2011, 10:33 AM I don&apos;t want to stir up a hornets nest but if you were diagnosed with als or parkinsons or ms or degenerative severe arthritis in canada? I&apos;d go or send a blood sample to the igenix labs in sanfrancisco or boston for lyme disease. In canada they test for 4 bands only and early infections can&apos;t be detected.Thats the min mandate by cdc. The igenix tests for like 16 bands. Its not just lyme? you may have aquired but there are co-infections that can have neurological ramifications in a similar family as syphilis and malaria.

The fish we froze last was getting pretty close to rotten. Kris81 Jun 5th, 2011, 12:10 PM have u ever noticed prices at BB or other retail stores ending with .99 .97 .95?

well theres a meaning behind each one

.99 Regular item (not on clearance)
.97 On FINAL clearance
.95 Gone when gone (not final clearance but almost clearance) never really understood this. :lol:

this is at BB.

Walmart does not do .99 on anything, they started doing .97 because people&apos;s eyes would be attracted more to the 7 than the 9 because it looked like a better deal to them. So people would shop at Walmart instead of other places. Kris81 Jun 5th, 2011, 12:22 PM Nothing Major, but i always thought to myself&quot;what happens if when i&apos;m mailing a letter I put where I want it to go as the return sender, and put my name as the address I want it to go to, and not put any postage on? The item would be killed and&quot;RTS&quot;and basically delivered for free.


Great way to have an item shipped for free, lol. Kris81 Jun 5th, 2011, 12:40 PM The fact that your packages say&quot;this side up&quot;or&quot;fragile&quot;don&apos;t make a difference at FedEx. They don&apos;t get any special treatment.

No, and why should they? The same is said with Canada Post. If I notice the sign saying&quot;Fragile&quot;or they wrote Fragile on it, i&apos;ll do it. But Canada Post has their own&quot;Fragile&quot;and&quot;Do Not Bend&quot;labels they stick on. If you want that service, you should pay for it (although like I said, i still do it if i see it out of common courtesy) wisdom_kid Jun 5th, 2011, 12:47 PM I verify sales for poor customers getting scammed into signing up for a water heater. Kris81 Jun 5th, 2011, 12:51 PM If anyone is interested, try reading Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. It details how food gets processed for fast food restaurants. The slaughter house stories are disgusting, and the discussion on how food flavorings are produced is interesting.

I read that book years ago, and was really turned off of Fast Food until someone pointed out that is how it works in the American system (mostly McDonalds as they discussed in that book). Canada has different rules&amp;regulations on how their meat/chicken/produce/vegetables are processed&amp;purchased.


That&apos;s why you can get a big mac in the states for like 97 cents EmperorOfCanada Jun 5th, 2011, 01:49 PM Nothing Major, but i always thought to myself&quot;what happens if when i&apos;m mailing a letter I put where I want it to go as the return sender, and put my name as the address I want it to go to, and not put any postage on?

I first came across that idea when reading a troll comic a few months ago (similar to this this (http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_liy4qizmEY1qe2mq3o1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId =AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&amp;Expires=1307404560&amp;Signature=Tzr3S1uD9OUXSN1tV3ba8r%2Fxvf8%3D) one but not the one I saw from a few months ago) and you just brought it up again.

I tried to Google it through some pretty random terms (since I wasn&apos;t sure how to properly search for the answer to that on Google) and I came across this link; read the first response.

Yea, that&apos;s pretty amusing, lol. I personally wouldn&apos;t do it, but when you see some of the things people on RFD do to get stuff for free/cheap, i wouldn&apos;t be suprised if someone attempted wedding invitations like that, haha damnos Jun 23rd, 2011, 12:52 PM Yea, that&apos;s pretty amusing, lol.

The problem from that story was the guy trying to send the mails across states, if you are sending it within the city it might just work
