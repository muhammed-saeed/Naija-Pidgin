 Why I became a vegetarian… Waking Up a Sleeping Giant 
Lentil Tacos–Tortillas Made From Rice Flour
 By Linda On Monday, September 10, 2007 · 12 Comments 
I’ve been having pain in my left thumb for a few years. I thought it was from an injury, but since I started working at the pizza place it spread to my right thumb and right ankle. I went to the doctor and found out it is arthritis. Some days at work, the pain was acute. Of course the doctor’s office didn’t offer anything but motrin to cover up the pain.
 
 
I’ve been doing some research, and discovered that wheat contributes to the problem, so I’ve been working on cutting wheat out of my diet, for the most part. And since I’ve been avoiding wheat, the arthritis pain has 90% disappeared. That’s the good news.

Because of my switch from using wheat, I’ve been experimenting with making things from rice flour, using no yeast. I made some great tortillas. Flour tortillas are easy to make–they are simply flour, salt, oil, and water. Here’s my recipe:

Flour Tortillas

A couple cups of flour, more or less.

Mix the flour with about a teaspoon of salt, more or less.

Into the flour/salt mixture, pour some olive oil. I probably use about 1 tablespoon or 2. Sorry I don’t have exact amounts, but this is how I cook.

Stir that up, as well as possible, then add warm water until you have a nice paste that sticks together a bit.

Take the flour mixture out of the bowl and knead it on a flour-covered board. I just use the drain board next to my kitchen sink.

Nice floury mess. I like that.

Then put it back into the bowl. You can let it sit for an hour or so, then knead again.

This time make little balls out of the flour. The balls should be about two or three inches across. Let them sit a while, then get ready to roll them out.

Heat up a large skillet or other flat surface. I use a flat griddle sort of thing. Prepare it with cooking oil to coat the surface.

Now the rolling pin thing is a matter of choice. I used to use a regular rolling pin, but the Mexican cook who taught me to make tortillas used a simple round piece of wood about the thickness of the bar you put your clothing on in the bedroom closet. Recently I saw such a piece of wood in a hardware store, bought it, and asked my boyfriend to cut a 12″length for me. This is perfect for rolling out tortillas. I just push it back and forth rather than using handles.

Anyhow, roll out the tortillas. They have to be super thin. You may have to experiment with this for a time until you find the thickness that works best, according to your tastes. And as soon as that puppy is rolled out, toss it onto the hot griddle.

As that tortilla browns, start rolling out another one. Turn the tortilla over once to do the other side. If there are air pockets rising while it cooks, you know you did the right thing. Those are the best.

When cooked, the tortillas can rest in a warm bed made from a bathroom towel. Yes, cover them completely to keep them warm for dinner.

Filling: The fillings I’ve been making lately have started with cooked lentils. I love lentils. This week I combined the lentils with rice and dried green peas. I put them in olive oil, smash them together with a fork, and simply warm them. I cooked the lentils with garlic and onion and salt, but at this point I like to add more garlic powder. I love that garlic taste.

Toppings for the tortillas–use whatever you have that you like:

Diced fresh tomatoes

Chopped onions

Grated cheese

Sprouts or lettuce

Sauteed mushrooms

Note: On days I don’t feel like making my own flour tortillas, I use corn tortillas instead.

Hi there…I just found your blog last night, trying to find a nice veggie dish for my tea. I tried these with loads of cheese, onions, sour cream and guac–amazing!

Hope you update soon!

the tortilla recipe sounds great–i’ve missed flour tortillas so much since i went gluten free about 6 months ago…other recipes looked so complicated but this looks doable!

on another note, i find it a little funny that you brag about never owning a cell phone and yet you can be followed on twitter…

Vansci, you don’t need a cell phone to use Twitter. I use it online, with my computer, only, but not often. I’ve got too many other things to do!

How do you make the rice flour stick together? I can’t get it to form into a doughy mass to roll out or form?

Rice flour is definitely a different texture, and hard to work with. I just pieced it together as well as I could–sometimes with rough edges. I much prefer whole wheat flour for tortillas…

Love finding this recipe…we have food sensitivities and wheat is a problem for me as well. Always on the lookout for good recipes that do not use wheat!
