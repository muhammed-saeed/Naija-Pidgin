 Miami New Times presents Iron Fork: a duel with knives and fire. 
​ If you&apos;re like us, your favorite competitive sport consists of two chefs engaged in kitchen combat. We&apos;re talking sharp knives, open flames, and meat -- this is one dangerous battle to the finish.

The best part: You get to eat the spoils of this particular warfare, along with delicious bites from dozens of Miami&apos;s best restaurants, at the New Times fourth annual Iron Fork.

This year&apos;s big event will be held Thursday, October 20, from 7 to 10 p.m. at Ice Palace Film Studios , with VIPs receiving an extra hour of tasting and partying at 6 p.m. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the United Way of Miami-Dade .
 

The event, which is curated by celebrity chef Allen Susser, features the Chef Challenge Finals, where returning champion Carlos Torres of De Rodriguez Restaurant Group will battle Timon Balloo of Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill.  The rules are simple: Each chef will receive a basket of ingredients, including one mystery ingredient. It&apos;s up to them to vie for the glory and the coveted Iron Fork award.

For the first time, Iron Fork is also presenting the Fighting Food Trucks Taco Tangle, an
intense battle between Jefe&apos;s Original Fish Taco&amp;Burgers and B.C. Tacos!

Tickets are $35 in advance, $45 at the door, and $65 for VIP admission. All tickets include the chef competition, food sampling, open bar, and live entertainment. Purchase tickets for Iron Fork 2011 here. And bring your appetite for the sport known as cooking.

Very uncomfortable event.  They were not ready for the crowds at all, long lines, very limited seating, cold food and shortages very early in the evening.  And where was the wine?
