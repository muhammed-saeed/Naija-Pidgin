 Chinese 

 
 Sarah wants something different for 
 lunch. Ok. Fine. But is she just trying to upset her father or is she 
 ready to try something new? 
 

 
 Living the Life of Holly
By Holly Winter
Going Chinese 

 “I think we should have Chinese food for lunch 
 today.”Came the suggestion from the back seat. 

 Ralph hadn’t learned to expect opposites from his 
 twelve year old daughter yet.“You do?”It took his full concentration 
 to keep the car on the road. If she had decided to start shooting up heroin 
 he wouldn’t have been more surprised. 

 “Yeah.” 

 “Wow.”I said.“That’s a first.”Sarah and I smiled at each other. 

 Ralph turned towards her.“You can’t order 
 a hamburger there. They don’t have American food there. And they 
 don’t have toys.” 

 “I know.”Sarah said, insulted.“I 
 want to eat CHINESE FOOD. That’s why I want to go to the CHINESE 
 RESTAURANT. God. Dad. Why don’t you get it?” 

 Ralph looked to me for the Holly Translation services. 

 “Honey-girl. I think it’s great that you 
 want Chinese food. I’m honored to be with you the first time you 
 try it.” 

 “Aren’t you and Daddy going to eat?” 

 “No. We already ate.”Ralph said. 

 “I still want Chinese.” 

 “Fine. But if we go there you have to eat Chinese 
 food.”He insisted. 

 “I KNOW.” 

 Ralph pulled into a little fast food restaurant in a 
 strip mall. It was empty. 

 “Great.”Ralph said, as we walked in.“There’s 
 no line. No waiting.” 

 “This’s so cool. Sarah. You’re trying 
 something new!”I said. 

 “I know.”She smiled. 

 We walked up to the counter. 

 “Well. What do you want?”Ralph asked, impatiently. 

 “How is she supposed to know?”I pushed my 
 best friend out of the way.“Let’s help her.” 

 Sarah contemplated the pictures.“No. I don’t 
 want any of that stringy stuff with sauce and rice and all that stuff.” 

 “Sarah.”Ralph huffed. 

 We ignored him. 

 “Honey. What do you feel like eating?”I 
 asked.“Chicken? Beef? Vegetables?” 

 “I don’t know if I want Orange Chicken or 
 Lemon Chicken.” 

 Ralph’s head spun around.“How do you know 
 about that?” 

 “Mommy had it one day. It looked good.” 

 “Wow.”He said, stepping back. It was starting 
 to sink in.“My little baby girl wants to eat Chinese food. Maybe 
 she’ll like it. Maybe we won’t have to eat hamburgers for 
 every meal. That’s incredible.” 

 We ignored him. 

 Sarah approached the counter.“What I would like 
 is half an order of Orange Chicken and half an order of Lemon Chicken.” 

 “Impossible. Can’t do like that.”The 
 owner announced. 

 “Why not?”Sarah asked. 

 “Can’t do like that.”He repeated. 

 “That’s what I want.”Sarah shrugged. 

 Ralph stepped forward.“You have to choose. You 
 can’t have both.” 

 “Ok.”She said.“I’ll have the 
 Orange Chicken.”She thought a moment.“And I want Won Ton 
 Soup.” 

 “How do you know about Won Ton Soup?”I laughed. 
 Come on. This was a big occasion. Her first ethnic meal. 

 “I read about it in a book. What is it, anyway?” 

 I thought a moment.“Um. It’s kinda like 
 chicken noodle soup. Only the noodles are bigger and there’s a little 
 piece of surprise meat tucked inside the noodle.” 

 “That’s perfect!” 

 The waiter brought the meal out. He gingerly placed it 
 in front of a very surprised Sarah. 

 I leaned over.“Honey. Did you sneak up and order 
 extra? You must have been very hungry.”The portion was big enough 
 to feed four adults. 

 “I can’t eat this much. Even you couldn’t 
 eat all that, Dad. Who eats here, horses?” 

 The soup was placed next to her entrée. It had 
 to be half a gallon served in one huge bowl. I know. Where were those 
 cute little soup bowls that you would normally get? Sarah’s mouth 
 dropped open. Little tears were forming in the corners of her eyes. This 
 may be the last time she ever orders Chinese in her whole life. 

 I laughed.“Honey. Eat what you want. You can take 
 the rest home.” 

 Ralph marched up to the counter.“Why did you give 
 her so much food?”The owner silently handed him a bill for eighteen 
 dollars. 

 “For one Orange Chicken and some soup?”Ralph 
 asked, outraged. 

 “Yes.”The owner said.“Is very good 
 food.” 

 Ralph glared at me and paid the bill. 

 She ate three pieces of Orange Chicken and two Won Tons 
 before she announced that she was full. 

 “You’re full? That’s it…..” 

 I interrupted Ralph.“Congratulations, Darlin-girl. 
 You just ate your first Chinese food. Did you like it?” 

 “I love it. I want to save some to eat at home 
 with Mommy.”She said.“She’s going to like it too.” 

 You’re not getting a hamburger. This’s your 
 lunch. That’s all.”Ralph said. 

 “They don’t have hamburgers here, remember 
 Dad?” 

 “Yes.”He sighed.“I remember. But 
 maybe we can’t come back till you’re a little older and you 
 can eat a little more.” 

 “Dad.”Sarah said, struggling under the weight 
 of her leftovers.“I said I wanted Chinese food. But, I never said 
 I wanted enough to feed everyone in China.”
