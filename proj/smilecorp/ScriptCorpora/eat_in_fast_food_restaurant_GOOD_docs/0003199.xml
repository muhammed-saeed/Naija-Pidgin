 A TEENAGE boy who fired a shotgun at several youths outside a Sydney suburban fast-food restaurant, hitting one, is behind bars, while his mother has been arrested for acting as his get-away driver as he fled the scene. 
 
Police today charged the 16-year-old boy and his 35-year-old mum, both from St Andrews, over the shooting in the early hours of Sunday 18 December 2011.

Detectives alleged that at about 5.45am the teen and his mother were in the drive-through of the restaurant on Pembroke Road at Minto when he was involved in an altercation with a number of male youths.

It is alleged that during the argument the boy produced a shot gun from the vehicle, firing at the group and hitting a 17-year-old male in the stomach, before fleeing the scene with his mother.

The injured man only suffered superficial injuries.

Police said the two groups were not known to each other prior to the shooting.
 
About 11.15am today police from Macquarie Fields Local Area Command conducted a search warrant at a house in St Andrews, arresting the 16-year-old alleged shooter and his mother.

Officers allegedly seized drugs, including steroids, ICE and cannabis, along with a large amount of cash and a BMW which was taken for forensic examination.

The teen was charged with shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possessing a prohibited drug.

He was refused bail and will face Campbelltown Local Court tomorrow.

His mother, who police allege was the driver of the vehicle, was charged with being an accessory after the fact and released on conditional bail.

She will face Campbelltown Local Court on February 22.
