Your 13-year-old comes to you and asks permission to start
babysitting so she can earn enough money for that great pair of
sneakers or a new video game. Or maybe your 16-year-old wants to
work at the local fast-food restaurant so he can save money for a
car.

If you&apos;re like many parents, you probably think a part-time
job, whether after school, on weekends, or during the summer, is a
good idea. After all, working teaches teens a sense of
responsibility, helps them pay for their own expenses, and teaches
them that money is something that&apos;s earned. So you may be
inclined to say,&quot;Sure, take the job.&quot;

But sometimes parents may not give much thought to the risks
their teens may face while working. Here&apos;s how you and your
teen can choose a safe part-time job that minimizes those
risks.

Common Jobs for Teens

Lots of teens work, especially 15- to 17-year-olds. Many
are employed in retail operations, including fast-food restaurants,
grocery stores, and other shops. Service industries, including
nursing homes, swimming pools, amusement parks, and moving
companies, account for another large portion of teen labor. And a
smaller number of teens are employed in the agricultural industry .

Other teens opt for entrepreneurial activities, such as
babysitting, delivering newspapers, and dog walking.

Risks to Teens

Of course, almost all jobs have hidden safety hazards: falling
off a ladder while reaching for a box on a high shelf, slipping on
a newly mopped floor, or being bitten by an unruly pet are just a
few risks your teen could encounter on the job or at the
workplace.

Other job injuries have more recently become common, such as carpal tunnel syndrome (an overuse injury in the wrists) and other repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) . Though mostly associated with computer work, RSIs can also
develop as the result of scanning items as a supermarket
checker.

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) in 2006:

 30 youths under age 18 died from work-related injuries an estimated 52,600 work-related injuries and illnesses among
 teens 15 to 17 were treated in hospital emergency
 departments 

And since only about one-third of work-related injuries are seen
in emergency departments, that means that an estimated 157,000
teens sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year.

According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
farming, forestry, and fishing industries are the most dangerous
and account for the most fatal occupational injuries; the retail
industry is the second most-hazardous; followed by the construction
industry. Transportation injuries on farms, highways, and
industrial premises account for almost half of fatal occupational
injuries among teens. Wholesale and retail trade and service
industries account for the majority of on-the-job nonfatal
injuries.

Depending on the industry they&apos;re working in, teens can be
at risk for serious dangers, such as injuries from heavy machinery
or illness from bacteria or toxic chemicals. Teen workers are
generally believed to be at increased risk of occupational injury
because of inexperience and limited training.

Starting the Job Hunt

If you and your teen agree about your teen looking for a job,
plan to spend some time searching for one that&apos;s safe and
enjoyable.

Talk about what your teen wants to do. If possible, your
teen should be interested in the job, not just taking it for money.
Someone interested in pursuing medicine in college, for example,
might seek a job as a nursing home worker or at a
hospital.

Try contacting the department of labor in your state. Among the
things you can ask them: the number of hours teens can work,
the hours of the day when they can work, and the types of jobs they
shouldn&apos;t do. For example, in some states teens under age 16
aren&apos;t allowed to operate deli slicers or fryers in
restaurants. And some teens under age 18 may not be allowed to work
past 10:00 PM on school nights.

You can also get helpful information from the National Consumers
League (NCL), a national organization that works (among other
things) to monitor and fight child labor abuses.

Starting a Business

How do you monitor the safety of a teen who wants to start
a business (or work independently, as in babysitting)? Check with
the labor department anyway; this may help you and your teen
establish some guidelines, like hours to work and what kind of
businesses are OK.

For example, let&apos;s say your 16-year-old wants to run a
window-washing business this summer, but the labor department in
your state prohibits minors from taking jobs that involve climbing
ladders. Even if you know your teen is mature and responsible, the
laws are there to protect teens from getting hurt.

Before your teen starts a business, steer your child to the
library or Internet for business and safety advice for young
entrepreneurs. Your local hospital, police or fire department, Red
Cross chapter, or YMCA/YWCA may have helpful information about first aid , CPR , and safety.

Before Your Teen Is Hired

To find out if a job is safe, talk to your teen and ask
questions such as:

 How did you find out about this job? If your teen got the tip from a trusted adult, for example, you
 might feel more comfortable with it than a job listed in the
 classifieds with an unknown company. Do you know the people you&apos;re working for? It&apos;s one thing for your 14-year-old to babysit for your
 neighbors and friends. But if you don&apos;t know your teen&apos;s
 boss, you may want to set up an appointment to meet before your
 teen accepts the job. How many hours will you work? What hours will you work
 (weekends, after school, school nights)? For the sake of grades and sleep, you and your teen should set
 limits. What protection will you have? If your child is working inside someone else&apos;s home or
 cleaning up at a restaurant after hours, find out if there&apos;s
 a security system and lock, as well as easy access to a phone to
 call 911 and other emergency numbers. Do you have the skills for this job? Age isn&apos;t always the key factor. A 13-year-old used to
 babysitting for younger siblings may be more qualified for
 such work than the 16-year-old who&apos;s an only child with no
 experience watching kids. And if your teen wants to be a
 lifeguard but has limited swimming skills, you might steer him or
 her toward the snack bar instead. 

Checking Out a Job Site

You might not have concerns if your teen is working around the
neighborhood with people you know. But you might have questions if
your child&apos;s takes a job where you don&apos;t know the people or
the environment.

If you choose, get references for jobs from the school, parents,
the labor department, and the Better Business Bureau. Make an
appointment to meet with your teen&apos;s potential employer and
take a quick tour of the work environment.

Ask questions, including:

 What are the specific job responsibilities? Find out if your teen can (legally and physically) or should do
 what&apos;s expected. What sort of training is offered? You should be satisfied that your child is properly trained to
 handle the job, is never asked to substitute in jobs for which he or she isn&apos;t
 trained, and that your teen&apos;s coworkers are also trained.
 Teens can also benefit from being trained in emergency procedures
 such as first aid, CPR, and burn treatment. Your teen should know to report any injury to a supervisor immediately - no matter how minor it seems
 - and to get proper treatment for it ASAP. Who&apos;s supervising my child? In some work situations, teens&apos;direct supervisors may not be
 much older than they are. So, an immediate boss may not know much
 more about the work or how to react in an emergency than your
 teen would. What other potential dangers have been
 addressed? A spokesperson for the Children&apos;s Safety Network provided
 this good advice:&quot;I know a pizza place that uses Caller ID
 to confirm the caller&apos;s identity, the address of the
 delivery, and that the order was really placed.&quot;These kinds
 of practices ensure that your teen is delivering to a legitimate
 customer and increase safety overall. What about working late at night? Many older teens work in late-night establishments like diners,
 ice-cream shops, and all-night groceries. You and your child must
 discuss the pros and cons of such work. Ask serious questions of
 the employers: Who&apos;s working with my teen late at night? Is
 there always an adult there? What security measures are in place?
 And be sure to check with your local police precinct for further
 suggestions and information. 

Keep Talking, Even After Payday

Don&apos;t stop talking after your teen has been hired.
Encourage your teen to discuss work regularly and offer specifics
on the workday (rather than just&quot;it&apos;s fine&quot;). For
example, you can ask:

 What was something interesting that happened at work
 today? Are you still handling the original job or have your
 responsibilities expanded? What are your new responsibilities? What kind of training did you get before you took on this
 additional work? Are you being paid more for the extra work? Why or why
 not? Do you think anything about this job will help you in your
 career someday? 

Talking to teens about their rights and experiences at work is a
great way to keep communication flowing. Explain that there are
laws to protect teens against sexual harassment and discrimination,
and encourage your child to come to you with all work-related
concerns, especially if anything&quot;doesn&apos;t feel
right.&quot;

Also make sure your son or daughter understands that with
rights come responsibilities. Some employers get away with paying
teens less than minimum wage by paying them&quot;off the
books&quot;and telling them they won&apos;t have to pay taxes. But
remind your teen that paying taxes is an important responsibility
and a legal requirement.

And be aware of your teen&apos;s physical health and safety: Is
he or she nodding off a lot? Are grades slipping? Does he or she
seem stressed out? You, your teen, and perhaps your child&apos;s
doctor can confer about maintaining a healthy balance between
school, work, and other responsibilities.

By investing some time in research beforehand, your teen can
have a fun, worthwhile, and safe job experience.
