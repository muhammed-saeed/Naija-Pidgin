         Flagstaff Central&apos;s
 restaurant reviews featuring Fast Food joints in Flagstaff Arizona. Let&apos;s face it, fast food is a way of life for our quick 
 paced society. So, it&apos;s always a good idea to find out 
 which place makes the best burgers,
 shakes, and French fries. Or, even better, other options 
 for Fast Food that are inexpensive but better for you!          
 
 Restaurant Name: Flame Broiler (Greentree Shopping 
 Center on Milton) Restaurant Rating: 8 (10 being the highest) Name: Anonymous E-Mail: Anonymous@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    For a quick meal that&apos;s 100x&apos;s better 
 than any of the standard burger slop places, this is really 
 great. They pretty much have basic meat, veggie, and 
 rice bowls. It&apos;s simply, tasty and relatively 
 inexpensive. A great place to take the family for a 
 fast food oriented meal that isn&apos;t greasy... 
 
 Restaurant Name: Sonic (Fourth Street) Restaurant Rating: 4 (10 being the highest) Name: Anonymous E-Mail: Anonymous@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    I want to start off by saying that I&apos;m 
 a fan of Sonic. They have a wider variety of food than 
 most fast food places, and the setup where you can drive up 
 and not feel like your in a line where you have to rush is 
 much better. I prefer it over most fast food place. With that said, I haven&apos;t had the best of luck with Sonic on 
 4th St. There have been a bunch of times where my 
 stomach really didn&apos;t like the food afterwards. The 
 taste was okay, but the revenge after was not. So, I&apos;d 
 try to stay away from this place. 
 
 Restaurant Name: Taco Bell Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: The Three Homeys E-Mail: OptionalEmail@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    They have great food and at a great price.
 Also, I can always count on them to give me what I want. 
 
 Restaurant Name: Taco Bell/Long John Silver&apos;s #022356 (Park Santa Fe -- 66&amp;Fanning Drive) Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: Mark Roden E-Mail: phpjh26@yahoo.com Restaurant Review:   I visited the Taco Bell/Long John
 Silver&apos;s there on Fanning Drive&amp;Route 66 on Tuesday, April 26, 2005 around
 12:30 pm. It was awesome food at an awesome price. Awesome Customer Service; Clean Restaurant and Restrooms; Outside was trash/litter free; Fast Service. I would recommend the 1/2 lb Beef&amp;Potato Burrito and L1 (2pc Fish Combo). I would like to compliment the crew for their hard work through the usually busy lunch rush. I would thank Patrick&amp;Ryan at the front counter for recommendations of what to eat. Their customer service was beyond belief. Talk about incredible service, the manager Carrie brought my order to my table -- thanks Carrie! Fast and awesome service with a smile is a rarely seen, but seeing this myself tells me that there are restaurants that still care about their customers. Thank you for the wonderful lunch. 100% CHAMPS with a YES Attitude! 
 
 Restaurant Name: Subway Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: Robert Laplaca E-Mail: OptionalEmail@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    Excellent food and service. 
 
 Restaurant Name: Hot Wok (in the old Taco Bell in Fort Valley Center) Restaurant Rating: 2 (10 being the highest) Name: KJ E-Mail: OptionalEmail@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    I got lunch to go and took it back to work. The portions were large for the price, BUT: The soup was gloppy and tasteless, the fried rice was just white rice with a little scrambled egg in it, and the egg rolls were REALLY greasy. The main dishes were decent. The best part of the meal were the packaged fortune cookies!
 Won&apos;t eat there again! 
 
 Restaurant Name: Subway Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: Trice E-Mail: jamiejaspers@hotmail.com Restaurant Review:    its good 
 
 Restaurant Name: taco bell Restaurant Rating: 6 (10 being the highest) Name: kristen E-Mail: brat_child_07@hotmail.com Restaurant Review:    we want to eat 
 
 Restaurant Name: jack in the box Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: jamil abdullah amir E-Mail: OptionalEmail@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    great 
 
 Restaurant Name: Taco Bell Restaurant Rating: 9 (10 being the highest) Name: Rebecca Rees E-Mail: RKR75AZ@AOL.com Restaurant Review:    Some times I don&apos;t know what I am in the mood for when I am looking for a place to eat lunch, I think of all the restaurants in Flagstaff, and I when I don&apos;t know what I want I always know that I can settle on
 Taco Bell cause I can always find some thing that I like there like the 7 layer
 burrito. I order it about every time and the service is quick and always friendly. I
 recommend Taco Bell to anyone who doesn&apos;t want to spend too much money on lunch . 
 
 Restaurant Name: Galaxy Diner Restaurant Rating: 10 (10 being the highest) Name: Becky Rees E-Mail: rkr75az@aol.com Restaurant Review:    I love the Galaxy Diner! It brings out the best in Flagstaff&apos;s
 restaurants and is differently a place to stop and check out when you are in Flagstaff and you are
 hungry. 
 
 Restaurant Name: Subway (in the Flagstaff Mall) Restaurant Rating: 4 (10 being the highest) Name: Anonymous E-Mail: Anonymous@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    When it comes to Fast Food, Subway is not a bad place to go. At least you can get a fairly decent sandwich without all the grease. The one in the Mall is a little more expensive than most, and doesn&apos;t seem to be super clean. The service is just okay too. I give this Subway a less than average rating. 
 
 Restaurant Name: Wendy&apos;s (on W Milton and 89 N by the Mall) Restaurant Rating: 7 (10 being the highest) Name: Anonymous E-Mail: Anonymous@flagstaffcentral.com Restaurant Review:    As fast food goes, Wendy&apos;s is truly the best. The fact that you can get a potato and a salad says something. 
Their chicken sandwiches are good, and their fries are always crispy.
They&apos;re my favorite fast food joint.
