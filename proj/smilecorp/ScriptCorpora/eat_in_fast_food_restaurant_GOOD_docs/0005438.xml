Who Invented the Breakfast Sandwich?
 The king of breakfast foods from fast food restaurants is undoubtedly the breakfast sandwich . What would we eat when we are on the run if McDonald&apos;s and every other fast food restaurant did not offer those greasy, delightful breakfast sandwiches? Whether you prefer sausage or bacon, cheese or no cheese, biscuits or English muffins—McDonald&apos;s has a solution for you.

Have you ever wondered who invented the breakfast sandwiches that are routinely served in all fast food restaurants. Wonder no more—it was me !

The first commercially sold breakfast sandwich appeared in Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in 1969. Mine first appeared in 1968! Yep, one of the biggest money-making ideas in the history of mankind was all mine. Doubtful? Read on as I attempt to convince you that the breakfast sandwich really was my idea and explain why I am not a multimillionaire today!

McDonald&apos;s Is&quot;Loving It&quot;

What&apos;s Not to Love?
 In April, 2010, Advertising Age made the statement that breakfast is &quot;McDonald&apos;s most profitable meal.&quot; Sounds like a reason to&quot;love it&quot;to me!

According to my research, the first fast-food restaurant to begin serving breakfast sandwiches was Jack-in-the-Box. They began selling them in 1969.

McDonald&apos;s franchise restaurants began selling breakfast sandwiches in 1972. Before that, they did not have a breakfast menu at all!

During my freshman year in college (1968), I presented the idea for a breakfast sandwich that would consist of sausage and a biscuit in a research assignment to a professor of economics and (need I say more) marketing !

Breakfast Sandwiches Were MY Idea
 I didn&apos;t spend my usual hundred-plus hours researching this topic - mainly because there just isn&apos;t enough information to require that many hours. Here&apos;s what little I found to refute my claim that it was I who invented the breakfast sandwich..

Wikipedia states: &quot; Origins are unclear , but many state a man in Southwest Oklahoma named Harold Moeller started it circa 1954.&quot; I found absolutely nothing to support that statement except other websites who quoted the Wikiipedia article. So, I have no idea who the&quot;many&quot;in the above statement might be .

Whoever they are, until I have other substantial proof that it was someone else who invented the breakfast sandwich, I contend they are dead wrong! Note: Wikepedia itself asks for&quot;credible references&quot;to statements used in that article. (The underlining and emphasis were added by me, of course.)

In a Facebook group dedicated (if you can believe it) to Breakfast Sandwiches, I found this statement: &quot;A man named Harold Moeller spawned the idea in Mountain Park, Oklahoma. Sausage biscuits were first commercially made in Garland, Texas. It was made in a factory named My Biscuit Inc. That is a factory where they made cake, ice cream, and cheesebread.&quot; 

With regard to that claim , I found nothing except a few websites with exactly the same information, obviously each copied and pasted from whoever the first one was. And, I found absolutely no information about a company named&quot;My Biscuit, Inc.&quot;- not in Garland, Texas, or anywhere else in the world.

 
 If one of your children ever has an essay involving breakfast foods and Mountain Park, Oklahoma, please block them from searching for: &quot;Mountain Park, Oklahoma&quot;sausage 

Seems a lot folks around Mountain Park might be more than just a little frisky, and they don&apos;t define&quot;sausage&quot;in the same way most of us do!

Learning About Cotton and Breakfast

Start Your Day Out Right
 At birth, I got&quot;dumped off the the turnip truck&quot;and landed in the cotton fields of Southeast, Missouri. Over the next several years, I learned a lot - about cotton and about my preferences for breakfast.

My parents were&quot;country folks&quot;, largely uneducated, and they knew nothing about the health risks so often associated today with favorite breakfast items. During the times when we could afford it, I absolutely loved having sausage, milk gravy, and biscuits for breakfast. My mother made fabulous milk gravy and biscuits that, for me, have never been matched! Breakfast was my favorite meal. Still is, as a matter of fact.

Gravy gets cold and yucky after a few minutes, and there was no such thing as instant-reheating with a microwave oven. So any leftover gravy was given to the dogs. BUT, Momma always put any leftover sausages and biscuits aside for later. One of my favorite treats was slipping back into the kitchen to slap one of those great country sausages between the layers of Momma&apos;s awesome biscuits.

Small Fish in a Big Pond

From the Cotton Fields to ASU
 In 1967, I graduated from my high school in the bootheel. I was valedictorian of my senior class, which had a total of 89 graduating seniors. And I wanted to go to college. If I made it, I would be the first in my family to have ever done so.

My high school adviser, a female teacher that I adored, warned me sternly that I would be unhappy there. Exact words were:&quot;You&apos;re used to being the big fish in the little pond; there you will be the little fish in a big pond.&quot;Loved her, but ignored her. Came up with enough scholarships, Federal grants and student loans to get myself to Arkansas State University in Jonesboro and never regretted it for a moment! 
My Claim to Fame

I invented the breakfast sandwich!
 During the last semester of my freshman year, I had a know-it-all professor of economics and marketing that assigned us a semester-long project. We had to invent something that did not exist. We had to describe, in detail, the non-existent product and the manufacturing and packaging process. In addition, we had to market the product, deciding what media mix we would choose for advertising and how often ads would run. Of course, we also had to set our budgets for every aspect of the process from beginning to end! And, our project had to come in at or below our projected budgets during the first year.

Quite a challenge for a bunch of kids, many of whom were just like me—fresh off the farm and not really engaged with the world of industry and commerce at all! Some of us didn&apos;t even have television sets and knew very little about the game of advertising. 
From Lunch Sandwiches to Breakfast Sandwiches
 Remember my adviser saying I would be a small fish in a big pond. Well, I was. However, I found many delights in that great pond.

One of them was fast-food restaurants! These were certainly not a part of the previous small pond experience.

Most mornings I just skipped breakfast. However, as often as possible, I made it to one or the other of the fast-food restaurants in Jonesboro for lunch. I fell in love with the whole idea of the quick, easy-greasy sandwich!

The Natural Transition

From Lunch Sandwiches to Breakfast Sandwiches
 Ah, back to how I got to be world famous for being the person who invented the breakfast sandwich. (No harm in wishful thinking, is there?)

Being someone who was accustomed to eating breakfast, it was difficult for me to make it until lunchtime when I could satisfy my hunger for those delicious, greasy hamburgers! And, I longed for Momma&apos;s sausage and biscuit sandwiches.

Maybe it was hunger pains that caused me to come up with the idea for my invention - breakfast sandwiches ! Wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful if I could just run into one of those fast-food restaurants and get a breakfast sandwich like those yummy ones I used to make from Momma&apos;s biscuits for a quick, easy, and wonderful breakfast!

Thus was born my idea for the product that I would&quot;invent&quot;for my economics and marketing research project. I would figure out how to make, package, and market this awesome breakfast food. I would become the one who invented the breakfast sandwich!

Well, I did it ! AND, I got an A on the research project. Did you know that banks won&apos;t take A&apos;s in exchange for money?

So, then why am I not just rolling in the dough (pun intended) from my excellent idea? 
If I Didn&apos;t Make Money...Who Did?

Ignorance is NOT bliss!
 Let&apos;s see. I was an 18-year-old, fresh-off-the-farm, naive little country girl, just beginning to learn what a big world it was off the farm, and about such exquisite things as malls and fast-food restaurants. Deception, back-stabbing, and sneakiness were not words that had any real meaning to me.

First of all, the very idea that I had a real, commercially-viable idea for making something that did not already exist never once crossed my mind. Needless to say, the concept of selling that idea to someone for profit was still out in the stratosphere for me.

So, I turned in my project, got my A, and forgot about it until years later. Naturally, since no&quot;capitalist&quot;thoughts even existed in my brain at that time, it never occurred to me that I should keep a copy of my completed project to later&quot;prove&quot;that it was I who invented the breakfast sandwich.

 You should now have strains of creepy, sneaky, underhanded, diabolical, villain-inspired music playing in your head. 

Did I mention that the professor who assigned this project was an economics and marketing professor ? Oh, yeah, I did. It is my firm belief that this man who knew a lot about capitalism and marketing sold my project idea and that idea first showed its&quot;proof of concept&quot;at Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in the following year. I don&apos;t remember when fast-food restaurants in Arkansas began serving breakfast. Whenever it was, by that time, I had totally forgotten my project. Clearly, however, it was a very good idea.

Historical Notation: This probably did not happen this way. However, it very well could have. So, as the saying goes: That&apos;s my story and I&apos;m sticking to it!&quot;

Moving On
 Okay. I just have to accept that I am never going to see a penny from my wonderful sausage and biscuit breakfast sandwich idea. I have no proof that it was I who invented the breakfast sandwich, and I can&apos;t disprove anyone else&apos;s story.

So, where does my story go from here. Well, I guess it&apos;s time I moved on to my next great idea. Let&apos; see............

How about sausage or bacon, eggs, and cheese served on a hot English muffin instead of a biscuit? Hmmmmm... Maybe not!
