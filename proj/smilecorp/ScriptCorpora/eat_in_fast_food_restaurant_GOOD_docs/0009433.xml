 Tips Even if you pick up your takeout food order, it&apos;s always a good idea to tip the server. After all, they have to take the time out for their other duties to prepare, pack, and serve your food to you. It&apos;s up to you whether you should tip as much as you would for a delivery order, however. 
 If you&apos;re watching your weight, you&apos;ll have to be careful with the takeout food. Limit your consumption of burgers and French fries, for example, and steer yourself toward low-fat meats like chicken. If that chicken is deep-fried, though, your best move is to peel the skin off before you eat. 
 Want a quick picnic? You don&apos;t have to slave over the stove for hours to fill that picnic basket. Instead, drop by a fast-food restaurant for takeout food. Some restaurants, especially chicken places, will gladly provide you with extras like mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw for a little more money.
