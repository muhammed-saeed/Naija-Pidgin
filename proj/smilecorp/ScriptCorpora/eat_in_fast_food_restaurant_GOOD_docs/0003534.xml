There&apos;s a reason why a lot of those crazy coupon ladies on TV choose Winco. Great prices! Winco is no Raley&apos;s, but it is open 24 hours... so I don&apos;t mind if the place doesn&apos;t have great lighting or happy customer service.

My favorite part is the bulk food area.They have a good variety of candy (lots of sugar free too!), pasta, nuts, dried fruit, trail mix, coffee, spices, rice, seeds, beans, etc. The Jalapeno bagels from the bakery are delicious.

My family and I were regulars here, the prices are way low compared to Bel Air which is right next door. Even if this place is always packed with tons of people, I really didn&apos;t mind. Up until we took a quick trip there on Easter Day.

As we were in line, a lady was asking us and everyone else that was in line. If we had any cash to trade for her food stamps? The cashiers obviously knew and heard that lady asking each customer also, but didn&apos;t do anything about it. The lady was seriously going to each lane, asking each customer out loud to trade her free food for cash, even parents that had their children while in line, were getting uncomfortable and a bit scared.

Then, right after as me and my husband were walking to the car. Another lady in a mini van pulls up with her children begging us for money. Telling us she needs money for rent etc etc?

Winco should do something about people in the store trading foodstamps for cash. Especially when the workers see and hear it! Customers like me and my family don&apos;t feel safe/comfortable going there on a weekly anymore. I do go there when I really NEED to, but rarely now a days. That&apos;s the main reason, we now shop at Bel Air.

I LOVE WinCo. Cheap, huge selection and open 24 hours.

And there&apos;s the entertainment at this ghetto location. Birds flying over the produce department, a good third of the customers are either in pajama bottoms or slippers, kids eating out of the bulk food bins, and there&apos;s always someone trying to pay with credit card (don&apos;t accept) or an overdrawn debit card. On some days, you can catch a fight while you wait in the long-ass lines.

As for the fruit, you just have to know how to pick it out. Sure, I&apos;ve seen pumpkins rotting in the bins, but I&apos;ve also bought some of the best fruit I&apos;ve ever had here.

Winco is great, but this location isn&apos;t. It&apos;s always a choice between shopping during the day and dealing with the crazy crowds, or shopping late at night and dealing with the stock lined up in the middle of every aisle.

I recommend driving to the Roseville, Folsom or Orangevale locations, even if they are out of your way. They are much nicer and less crowded. I rarely even have to wait in line at the Orangevale location.

I would be a little more enthusiastic about this post if I actually thought the employees/&quot;owners&quot; cared about their company. But the simple fact is, there will always be enough ghetto in the world to keep this place busy, so why should they care?

I have been here about 10 times. I literally live across the street so I wish I could come more often to spare myself from the belair price gouge.  The parking is atrocious. Even if there is an open parking spot near the front, the place is a shopping cart grave-yard and dodging pedestrians that look like they&apos;ve just stepped off the boat and have never seen a car before is truly entertaining, just not for me. Don&apos;t even bother coming here on the 1st and 15th of any month. This place is crawling with people loading up 3 carts at a time around then and the checkers do not care if someone is waiting behind a 3-carter. Very nonchalant.  The best part is, though, when you do get up to the checkout stand, you&apos;ll likely be able to hear the conversation between your checker and the checker in the next lane talking about how much they hate their jobs. Yeah, I guess that would explain the dirty look I got as a greeting. Didn&apos;t realize it was MY fault that your life sucks. Oh and hey, WinCo, I realize that you guys are 24 hour, and you need to restock at some point, but maybe you can do it so that the entire store is still accessible at 5 am. Oh! And I love the birds flying around the ceiling in the produce section! Pure entertainment.

It doesn&apos;t matter what WinCo you go to, they all look the same. It doesn&apos;t matter if it is opening day or older than the hills themselves: they all look half built. BUT...I can see where this helps. The company provides facilities that are no frills so they spend less and can charge less. It works. Some people have a problem with bagging their own groceries but I don&apos;t mind it...it takes me back to the days when I ran the front end at  large grocery center in Oklahoma City. I just hate watching the 80 year old blue-hair trying to bag canned goods and carrying them. I especially like the bulk food area, where you can get 23 pounds of scrumptious granola, though it might cost you a pretty penny. Either way, it&apos;s your choice. I definitely will be going here on a regular basis even though it&apos;s 2 towns over.

Dirty place and parking lot. The wife and I walked in and found used condoms in parking lot. Nasty! Also produce seemed old and all of the birds inside and extremely long lines made us turn around and leave. Roseville location is very nice and clean.

What did the bird say as it flew over WinCo?

Cheap Cheap!!

WinCo has its place for my food buying, but not all of it. I will not buy produce or meat here as fruit and veggies seem to go bad in less than 24 hours. Canned goods or dry goods can be a very good price but I generally choose to shop at another local store instead.

There are A LOT of people here during the day and I have to make that decision on whether saving a few bucks is worth is sometimes. .

WinCo has some great prices for most items.  They only accept cash, debit cards, and of course food stamps/SNAP cards/CalFresh.  It&apos;s too bad that so many of the customers are scary ghetto thugs with food stamps/SNAP cards/CalFresh.  That&apos;s the reason why WinCo has an armed guard at the front door and one in the parking lot.  Unfortunately Antelope (like most of Sacramento) has become thugville.

Another grocery store with just as many cons as pros.
Cons: produce isn&apos;t always fresh, crowded all the time, mediocre customer service, mediocre bread
Pros: good bakery (besides the bread itself), large selection of foods, well stocked, low prices
I used to absolutely love Leonardi&apos;s pizza inside the grocery store, but it has been closed for a while. Miss that place.

I love winco because of their prices and varieties.  I can find every item and brand that I am looking for here.  Their prices are so much cheaper than Safeway, Bel Air, etc. and you never need a club card for discounts.  I also love their bagels from their bakery.  You need to go there early, or else they run out of bagels.

This winco does not have baked pizza like some of the others I&apos;ve been to.  Actually most wincos have a baked pizza shop except this one.

Winco does not accept credit cards, only debit, cash and ebt.  This winco has the type of customers you expect to find at walmart not costco if they makes any sense.  Lots of customers on ebt.

You also bag your own grocery, I have no problem with that at all!  If you bring in your own reusable grocery bag, make sure to tell the check out person, they will give you credit for each bag you bring.

The polar opposite of Bel Air which sits across the street, but in my eyes, both of these stores deserve the high marks I give them!

I love this place!  I love how I can walk into the store with the intent to buy broccoli, and I end up leaving with other vegetables, some meat, and some milk by virtue of them all being on sale.  The lines used to be a lot longer, but since the opening of Super Walmart, the wait time has been cut down drastically.  If you want friendly customer service, get your ass out of here and to the nearest Bel Air across the street!  This place is everything you expect from a discount grocery store.  This is the price you pay for half price groceries.  Yes you may have a rush of welfare people with full carts, or long lines in the beginning of the month, but you just keep thinking of the savings :-)

I would also recommend eating the pizza in the front of the store at the Leonardi&apos;s!  Yum this pizza is delicious.

I think my only gripe with this place is the fact that they do not accept credit cards.

In the end, just remember that you didn&apos;t come to Winco to get customer service and top quality meats... you came here to save money!

Cheapest prices around- some drawbacks though:
bag your own groceries, bananas are always green, fresh meat quality is sketchy, crazy crowd, the parking lot is always full and dirty/sticky. Bonus: I have had my purse stolen here!

Still, WinCo is one of my shopping staples. Great bulk section, cheapest produce, lowest everyday prices. People watching possibilities are phenomenal!

Why is it no matter what WinCo location you go to - you can&apos;t leave without being completely agitated?

Given - it was eleven at night, but the lines weren&apos;t horrific.

However, the woman ringing messed up the welfare check of the woman in front of us and the manager or whatever she was wouldn&apos;t come to see the situation, instead they yelled back and forth ten feet. Really? That&apos;s rude and embarrassing for the woman and her husband trying to get food.

So, this is backing up the line. The yelling manager lady comes over and pulls from THE BACK of the line instead of the person behind the messed up check.

I made it two stars instead of one because I wanted pickles and I got them under $3. Also, there were two girls in line with a huge amount of stuff that let my boyfriend and I go in front of them (We only had pickles).

Like a previous reviewer said - I&apos;d rather pay MAYBE $5 more than being treated like crap. Grocery shopping shouldn&apos;t be so frustrating.

I just have to add my 2 cents about Winco. It is UNBELIEVABLY cheap !! The only drawback is that the produce is lousy. Oh, and I believe there was a gang-related shooting in the parking lot a couple of weeks ago........Which is why I go to the Winco in Roseville.
But seriously, if money is tight for you, you need to be grocery shopping at Winco.
Update:
OK, apparently that last sentence came out sounding something like:
&quot;All you ghetto people need to shop at Winco while us yuppies stick to Bel-Air&quot;
What I meant to say was that if you want/need to save money, like most of us do, I highly recommend shopping at Winco.

Cheap.  Cheap.  Cheap.  Dare I say it, the cheapest grocery store I have ever been to?  Winco gets a prize!  I now see why my mother chastises me for spending the &quot;big bucks&quot; at Trader Joe&apos;s.  What would she think about my sometimes Whole Foods&amp;Wild Oats splurges?

Winco has a deli that sells pizza and grinders.  Not subs, not sandwiches, not hoagies, not heros, not poor boys -- no a real grinder here in the West Coast.  I had a bite of the Italian meats grinder (pepperoni, salami&amp;other salty meats) on Italian bread, tons of cheese, garlic and other fatty deliciousness a few years ago (I was then ignorant about my wheat allergy).  One bite and I was transported back to New England.

My husband had a grinder this weekend while we visited the family.  The grinder was as fab as ever.  My mouth salivated.  I sniffed his grinder.  Woe is me.  The life of a wheat allergic girl:(

I love shopping at Winco Foods. It&apos;s about a fifteen/twenty minute drive from home but it&apos;s always worth it! I save a TON of money here. The selection is huge and I always stock up on a ton of fresh fruit&amp;veggies. I loaded up my cart until I almost couldn&apos;t push it with everything from frozen goods, chocolate, meat, pumpkins and soda and I still only spent $130.01. That&apos;s a huge plus for a single mom like me!

The only things that suck about the place is that it&apos;s so huge, I almost need a map and bagging my own groceries can be a bit tiring.

A Tale Of Two Supermarkets:

At the intersection of Elverta Road and Walerga Road, there are two supermarkets that are a study in contrasts: Bel-Air and Winco.

Bel Air is top notch in everything--except price, which is rather expensive for most items.

Winco is arguably just the opposite. Winco is *very* good for prices, but lines are hellish, service is overwhelmed, the place is shabby and they do not accept &quot;magic plastic&quot;.

I hate hate hate WinCo in general due to their bugs in the dry foods, fruit flies around the produce, but this WinCo exasperates me to no end. One check out lane open the weekend after everyone&apos;s food stamps arrives? Bag your own groceries and feel rushed as the next person&apos;s groceries start to head down toward&apos;s yours? Carts with 1/2 of the wheels working? THEN THIS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IS FOR YOU.

It&apos;s not worth saving the $ on groceries. Bel-Air and Safeway are just worth it.

This place is so damn cheap I have to question how the place even makes money.  They sell Arizona green tea for about $1.5-$2 cheaper than Bel-Air across the street.  It&apos;s amazing how much $30 will buy you at that place.  I highly recommend trying the almond butter (found right next to the water jug dispenser). You can&apos;t beat fresh almonds ground up right before your eyes!  To my shock, their deli pizza&apos;s are pretty damn good.  I did not expect this from a grocery store.

Try to avoid going there after 10pm because that&apos;s when they have only 3 registers open and most likely the person in front of you is paying with food stamps (or some type of government assistance payment) for $200 worth of groceries (in Winco&apos;s world that&apos;s about 2 carts filled up to your head). IT TAKES FOREVER for your turn to come!

By far the best &quot;American&quot; supermarket out there. I wish there was one in San Jose! Warehouse prices at a supermarket location! Every time I&apos;m back in town I always do my grocery shopping at this location.

You do have to bag your own groceries and the service isn&apos;t anywhere near 5 star material (not even 3 or 4 star in my opinion), but it&apos;s well worth the sacrifice in my opinion for the prices they offer. Wide selection of beer too!

Winco is a little out of my way, but my boyfriend and I love Mrs. Renfro&apos;s Habanero Salsa, so we make the trip for it.

I like it, nothing is hard to find and the lines are sometimes horrendous. That&apos;s life. I&apos;ve never had problems with the checkout people; some of the customers are incredibly rude but that isn&apos;t Winco&apos;s fault.

WinCo Foods is great if you play it right. First of all, leave your Visa at home.
To get your money&apos;s worth, you need to focus on the canned goods, frozen foods, and packaged types of goods. The produce is average to good depending on the day and how many people have picked through it with their dirty hands. Plus, the flies and birds have had their share of fun with the produce as well.
The meat is average. The seafood doesn&apos;t seem fresh.
The bread, tortilla&apos;s etc is fine.
The worst thing about WinCo is the questionable customers that roam the place. I have been yelled at by big ladies for being in their way. &quot;I&apos;m the one that is taking up less space in this place! Why are you mad at me?&quot; I have heard stories about food fights and other types of conflict. Some of the cashiers are more friendly than others. You can tell who the happy people are.
Overall, WinCo is a great place to save tons of money.

Okay, yes, this place is extremely cheap. If you go, don&apos;t expect to come out of the store in a good mood, even though you probably saved a few bucks. Don&apos;t even dare step foot inside at the beginning of the month on the weekends- big NO NO! The employees are usually nasty and rude. They seem mad at the world to say the least. And, finding a cart with working wheels is definitely a struggle. Oh, don&apos;t buy their meat, just pay a little more and get the good stuff across the street at Belair.

I will give them this- they are open 24 hours which is very convenient so you don&apos;t have to deal with the crazy hustle&amp;bustle during the day. The fruits&amp;veggies are just like any other store and their bulk section is pretty amazing (CHOCOLATE COVERED GUMMY BEARS!)

I would give it a go if you&apos;re really in the mood to deal with it, but if the parking lots full, I would rather spend a little more and not come out wanting to shoot myself in the head.

I shop here all the time. Why anyone would pay the prices that Bel Air, -Raleys or Safeway charge is beyond me. You have to bag your own groceries but, so what. The savings are worth it. I&apos;ve never seen any fruit flies or pests inside. The parking can be a challenge, The staff has always been friendly and polite. Don&apos;t go around the 1st unless you enjoy the agony of morons that can&apos;t read using their food stamps ( I&apos;m not saying everyone on food stamps is a moron, just the ones that seem to get in front of me). Just be fore warned  that shopping on the first or around a holiday can be a challenge.

What can i say... I&apos;m a regular...   Ok ok i freakin stalk Winco! I live at this place... I should pay rent..  Wait wait wait..  They should pay ME to shop here i am so loyal. Canned.. Bottled.. Bagged from the manufacturer and you are good.. Keep away.. I REPEAT.. KEEP AWAY from the fruits and most of the veggies. Horrible! If you do feel like living on the edge and decide to grab an apple or two eat it within 24 hours or that worm you saw on your grandmothers grass last week will pop out of that sucker like Cinderf*cknrella and the pumpkin! Otherwise.. Eat i repeat EAT all of the fried chicken you can buy in the heart attack fried deli section here because it is the best damn chicken ever! I sware! Bible! Prices are amazing and staff is always cool... 24/7 you cant beat that! Now beware that it can get a bit ghetto in here from time to time but hey you get to people watch while you shop for food. Like an added bonus. I have decided that for the rest of my life i have to live within a 1mile radius of any Winco! Its like crack and i am the fiend!

If you need/want to save money this is the place to go. I always grocery shop here. I have never seen fruit flies or anything like that.
I have to admit that it is really ghetto. And I would never leave my purse in the car.
I also think paying 10 dollars at bel-air or safeway, savemart, all those places when you can get it for 7 dollars here, makes you kind of ignorant. I&apos;m sure they might be nicer other places but you can get crappy or great service anywhere. I have had not so great check out people and really nice check out people. I save literally hundreds of dollars A MONTH by shopping here for my family of four and the visitors that seem to eat all my food!
Ghetto? Absolutely. Worth it? Only if your smart.

Grimey grocery store but everything is pretty chreap. Kind of like a walmart for grocery stores. I don&apos;t need all the fancy decor or organic hippie food. If u do, don&apos;t come here.

Guy Davenport is nominally the King of Antelope. When he is in the area, he shops at winco, even though the place has lately become over-run by wannabe thugs and eastern europeans. But once upon a time, there was no better place to get jones soda and home run pies. Damn them and their bright lights and insanely low prices. I will give them an extra star since the always fine Tori is still a cashier there, still smoldering with sexual tension. Also, in case any of you are wondering, you have Guy Davenport and Shock McMannigan to blame for the lack of doors on the bathrooms.

This is my favorite market. Forget Raley&apos;s, forget Safeway, forget Wal-mart. For value, convenience and selection WinCo food is where it&apos;s at.

winco is the shit as long as you don&apos;t go there on the 1st when everyone&amp;their mamas get their welfare checks!

yes they are cash only (atm/debit) but if you think about it, they&apos;re saving you $ because if you could use your credit card, you would have to pay interest.  so yes, winco wins again.

Love Win Co it is cheaper than other grocery stores even cheaper than Wal Mart. It is very hard to get groceries if you go on are around the first of the month, everything is out of stock and it is so very crowded as well. Overall the best grocery store for the money.   I also love their pizza that they sell there, good prices and tastes a whole lot better than Papa Murphy Pizza does.

Yes it is inexpensive, but you have to be willing to do a little work bagging your groceries and putting up with your fellow morons bagging theirs, which can be stressful.  We love the variety of bulk items and always are amazed at the selection and prices. The bins are a foodies paradise.

And for my next review, I must comment on a consistently negative shopping experience. For an employee owned company, they sure have lousy customer service. Speaking of &quot;Customer Service&quot;, it closes at 9:00 PM, even though it&apos;s a 24 hour store. Need a bottle of vodka? It&apos;s locked in the closed &quot;Customer Service&quot; area. No offer to retrieve your request for a bottle at 9:15 PM. All of my other groceries were immediately left on the counter as I said, &quot;Good night&quot;. I have other stories, but why bother?

Been coming here off and on since 2002, Huge grocery, CHEAPEST PRICES in SACRAMENTO. NOT really good produce, meats are OK. The PIZZA made there is very good and cheap! Alcohol is reasonable prices, it gets crowded all the time. Be sure to show up anytime  24HOURS OPEN!
