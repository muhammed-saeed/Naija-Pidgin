Hi,
your cost can go from 5-100 euros, depending on the restaurant and your own taste.
in čika ljubina street, just behind the republic square and national museum in belgrade, there&apos;s the very good fast food restaurant where u can choose according to your taste different cooked, fried or baked food.

Be care about which restaurant You pick for a meal... Some are very nice on the first sight, but the service they offer very poor and bad communication with a customer. I recommand, if you like some italian cuisin, restaurant Fresco in Vuka Karadžića 12, its just by the pedestrian zone of Knez Mihailova Street... if you walk through this area you should visit also Kalemegsanska Terasa Restaurant, in the Kalemegdan Fortress, after the pedestrian zone I said. As the matter of fact, in this area you should found many nice places for a dinner...

depends on which restaurant or fast food would you like to visit. If you want a luxury dinner in some good restaurant it could cost you for one person 50 euro, 100 euro...and more...I say it depends on what you want to order. You also have not so expensive restaurants where you can eat and have very good meal for about 20 euro (about 1800 dinars, but that is a meal with main meal and everything, you can have a dinner there for less price)...more or less... and also you have places with fast food where you can have an good meal (meat and bread-hamburgers or something like that) which costs about 2 euros (200 dinars)....so it depends what you want to eat and where.
you can visit this web and see some restaurants and prices in Belgrade:
http://www.belgradeeye.com/skadarlija.html
here you can see our the most famous quarter called Skadarlija where you can find very old restaurants and not so cheep... or you can find some restaurants on this web :
http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g294472-Belgrade.html

about drinks, it is very similar price wherever you go. for example one coca-cola in some cafes is about 120 dinars (1.5 euro), but generaly in Belgrade it is very important on which location in town restaurant or cafe are located. Location is the most important fact on which bosses put the price. So coca-cola is somewhere about 120 dinars, somewhere is 150 dinars, and somewhere is 90 dinars, but for that places you have to know Belgrade very well :) I think that only people from here can find cheep places

Well, it depends, first of all, on weather you want to dine in a fancy, international restoraunt down town (from about 2000 din per person=about 25 euros), or in a fast food place (from about 10 euros). In total, it is possible to have a nice meal in a decent place for about aproximatly 15 euros per person... Hope I&apos;ve answerd your question, enjoy your stay in Belgrade :)

It depends on what type of dinner you want... Maybe, You can be more precise. :) You can eat very cheaply by fast-food restaurants. Also, you can have a decent dinner for one person (in an average restaurant) for 10 euros ...

You can eat Burek&amp;Yogurt;for as little as 1 euro! And it is the most valuable meal! Also you can have popular Serbian fast food &quot;pljeskavica&quot; (hamburger) and a beer for 2 euros / talking about &quot;take away&quot; food. If you like to seat and eat pljeskavica (or another meat menu), french fries, some salad and a drink will cost you between 5 and 7 euros.

It depend on many things, but it is not a big diference in price in whereever you sit and eat or drink. Main meal is always betwen 550-1000 din ( 6-10 euros). But very important thing is that in Serbia the portions are much much larger than anywhere in Europe.
Enjoy your stay in Belgrade
