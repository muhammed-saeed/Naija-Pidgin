 Getting into the legal field 
 Added on : Sunday July 08th 2012 07:00:44 PM I&apos;m considering going to law school in a year or two, but I would like to try working in law first to see if I like it, and what I like. I have a 2 year degree in Business Management with a good GPA, including a business law class, and I am married to an attorney. What are some good jobs that I can get into without a degree, that would give me a good sense of whether I want to work in this field? I was considering paralegal work but I assume this needs a degree, or maybe being a legal secretary or something similar (I&apos;m in Ohio). What are some job titles to look for? And what are some hints for how to package myself to get an interview and get hired? I am interested in criminal prosecution, civil plaintiff work, gaming law, consumer law (representing consumers), and possibly criminal defense.If at all possible, I would like to get into at least the thirties in terms of salary, although this isn&apos;t a hill to die on.

 College for the &quot;well off&quot; but not Rich 
 Added on : Wednesday July 04th 2012 02:00:45 PM I would like to start a thread on the recommendation of another poster. Basically how do people who make a good living save for college? I have 3 kids as I have mentioned in previous posts, college for all 3 could easily be the better part of a million dollars when they go. I will have kids in college 2017-2027, and 3 of those years I will have 2 in college. Here are my issues with college:I dont think it is right to pay for college with mostly loans, or any loans at all really. This is especially true for a liberal arts degree; I make an exception for professional and doctoral programs. This is obviously impossible for 90+% of the population. My feeling is that college is overpriced because the government will guarantee loans, and people will take them. This creates fake demand and pushed the price up. I am 100% sure this is happening, but there is really nothing I can do about it. With 3 kids I am being squeezed!
How the F*** does anyone of my generation save that kind of money! The stock market has been flat for 10 years, and interest rates dont even cover inflation. Even if you make good money and save a lot ($20,000yr for 3 kids) for college, you still will fall short. Basically if you want your kids to go to a private college, or in my case (University of Michigan obviously not private) you need to be rich, not just well off. My understanding of the system is that if you have no money and are smart enough to get into the school you can get a need based scholarship. If you are very wealthy than you have no issues I guess. But if you are doing OK, and saved and scrimped for years, college will cost you everything!So basically the point of my thread is to toss around ideas on how people can intelligently mitigate the cost of college. Ideas and strategies that can help people with money, just not all the money in the world.

 Debt reduction/saving advice for recent grad 
 Added on : Wednesday June 27th 2012 11:00:48 PM I&apos;m a 25 year old, very recent graduate with a professional degree. I would love to get some advice on the best strategy for paying off my debts and building savings/retirement funds. I currently have $28,500 in subsidized federal student loans, which will go into repayment and start accruing interest @6.8% in November. I currently have about $8,000 in the bank. I&apos;m bringing in about $4,500/month after taxes and 401k contributions (currently set to max out employer match) and my monthly expenses are around $2,000/month (including some discretionary spending). I don&apos;t have any other debts and have no retirement savings until 401k deferrals start next paycheck. My goals are to get out of student loan debt as quickly as possible while starting to build savings/retirement funds. My future plans may include pursuing further training in my field in about 2 years. This would mean 2-4 years of making just enough to cover my expenses (however, I shouldn&apos;t have to acquire any additional debt) and my salary afterward would be similar or slightly below what it is now. Yes, money-wise it&apos;s a bad move, but I would be choosing to work in a field that I truly love and accepting lower compensation/opportunity cost of time back in school. With that in mind, I want to make sure that I put myself in the best position I can financially over the next 2 years. My short term plan is to set aside $4,000 as an emergency fund and using the remaining $4000 in the bank as the start of my savings, then focus the majority of my $2500 excess monthly income towards student loans to lower the principal as much as possible before they start accruing interest. When November rolls around, I&apos;d start diverting more money into savings while still making large contributions towards debt repayment (perhaps 1700 loans/800 savings). If all goes as planned, I&apos;ll have paid off my student loans, established a good amount of savings and started my retirement fund before having a couple of lean years in grad school. I&apos;d like to get some input on whether this sounds like a reasonable strategy and how I can improve it. I feel like I&apos;m in a good position to get started, but need some careful planning so as not to hurt myself if I do go back to school in 2 years. Should I defer more money into 401k? Do large monthly payments throughout my loan grace period seem reasonable, or would I be better off accruing money in the bank for now and making a lump payment just before November? If need be, I could buckle down somewhat on monthly expenses and funnel more money other places - would you recommend it and why? Thanks for any advice you have to give!
 Parents want to pay off loans - but we&apos;ll pay them back - how to do it 
 Added on : Tuesday June 26th 2012 05:00:46 PM My husband and I are currently saddled with a mountain of debt from his law school degree. Each set of our parents has offered to loan us the money (100K from each of them ) to pay off the loans most of which carry with them a whopping 8.5% interest rate. His parents would charge us a much lower interest rate (3%) and give us a longer term. My parents, however, would prefer not to charge us interest and have us pay them back over a shorter term, which now of course I understand has gift, and thus tax, implications. But . . . is there any way to to do it?
 Cousin that works construction wants to go to school for &quot;Business Management&quot;. Input? 
 Added on : Tuesday June 26th 2012 12:00:52 PM My 21 year old cousin works in the construction field installing flooring. He has potential for upward movement, however they have put pressure on him to get a college degree. (Any bachelors degree). They&apos;ve indicated the degree will make it much more likely to be moved up to certain positions. He wants to pursue a generic &quot;business Management&quot; degree because it would be one of the easiest ways to meet the qualification of &quot;any degree&quot;.I may be biased because I didn&apos;t feel like a business management degree did anything for me. I started out majoring in &quot;business management&quot; and ended up doing a double major of finance / accounting to increase opportunities out of college. My opinion is that business management (generic degree) is typically a waste of one&apos;s time and money. A job that requires &quot;any degree&quot; is often a job you shouldn&apos;t be aiming for (I&apos;m sure there will be exceptions for this with gov&apos;t jobs, or jobs that will be landed with your connections.) Could I be wrong about the value of a management degree, since he already has work experience? He should qualify for a lot of financial aid due to low income. (He made $20,000 which is higher than his single parent mother&apos;s income) - I helped him complete FAFSA and EFC was $0. But, I don&apos;t think this should keep him from looking at majors that will provide value. If it was about playing / partying that would be one thing, but I think he legitimately thinks this is going to help him.I realize this isn&apos;t a new topic on FW, as I frequently see the value of various college degrees analyzed on here. However we come from a stubborn family, so I really would appreciate anyone that wants to weigh in to this specific topic. If he listened to anyone, it would be me or perhaps the FW community (I believe I&apos;m the first and only person in my family to get a college degree, and he respects me greatly.)

 Moving out of rental, mold found. pics 
 Added on : Monday June 25th 2012 02:00:46 PM When moving out of our rental today, we found mold in a closet behind a picture that was in storage. I believe the mold came from the sprinklers being on too much. The owner takes care of the sprinklers and yard, so we do not regulate the flow and it opereats during the night so we do not know how much it waters. My question is what recourse do we have if he tries to charge us for it? We are moving out of state. Edit Directly below the faucet is the sprinkler the shoots in a 90 degree fashion.The wall with mold is on the wall that is perpendicular to the wall.PS we have had a great relationship tenant/landlord relationship up to this point. IE always paid rent early, very little maint. needs, improved property, will be returned in very clean condition, and he gave us a glowing recommendation to our new landlord.

 SYLVANIA White 6-in Remodel Recessed LED Lighting Kit $24.98 Lowe&apos;s YMMV 
 Added on : Thursday June 21st 2012 11:00:05 PM I was at the Lowe&apos;s in Torrance, CA looking for a Ceiling Fan for my brother and ran across some SYLVANIA White 6-in Remodel Recessed LED Lighting Kits. I&apos;m just finishing up a remodel and was looking to put in some Cree CR6 Recessed lights but these were showing a $24.98 price on the shelf as their &quot;Everyday Low Price&quot; and appeared to have good reviews online at various site. Being that they are about $6~7 less then the lowest price I can find for the Cree lights I picked up ten to see how they would look and they look great in the Master Bedroom so I decided to pick up more for the rest of the house. They are 3000K vs the Cree 2700K which makes them a light cooler on the brightness, but they cast a good light and don&apos;t feel too bright. They show up as being $49.98 online and in a couple other stores I have been in. Using the Lowe&apos;s mobile App in the store, I noticed the in store price would show the lower price, but if I was not in the location it would show the higher online price.Rather then go back to the same store since it is quite a ways away I decided to do a price match at another local Lowe&apos;s using my original receipt and there was no issue so I bought what they had in stock. Went to another store down the street to get the rest that I needed, showed my receipts to the cashier and the lighting guy decided to butt in while the cashier was starting to proceed stating he won&apos;t do the price match if it were up to him because it was half the cost. Needless to say they didn&apos;t end up price matching, but I did head to a third Lowe&apos;s the next day and picked up what they had in stock I could and will be on the look out for one more to finish off my project.Showed the lights to a work buddy and he decided to take a snap shot of my receipt and went to another Lowe&apos;s to pick up 6 and was able to price match as well.Sylvania LED Recessed Light Kit Lowe&apos;s Item 78215Light Specs:

 Avoid student loans your entire life by going to school...for 29 degrees. 
 Added on : Wednesday June 20th 2012 06:00:45 PM I know we&apos;ve discussed endlessly taking classes to put students loans on never ending deferment before, but I never thought anyone would seriously do this. I think we may have found a winner though: a Michigan Man has 29 college degrees and is getting more. The story doesn&apos;t say much about his finances and I suppose its possible that his wife is rich or he got some huge inheritance, but its unlikely as he says hes worked menial jobs to make just enough money to go through school. Plus, since every school I am aware of charges fees for people who already have a BA/BS and are getting another one, I suspect hes racked up quite the student loan debt.So if he does have student loans, he won&apos;t ever have to pay them...he says hes going to keep going for more degrees.

Reliable, 10 amp DEWALT-built motor
Reversible, variable-speed control from 0 to 1,200 rpm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patented DEWALT-Built Motor with Overload Protection
With its powerful 10 amp motor, the DEWALT 1/2-Inch VSR Pistol-Grip Drill is capable of delivering speeds of 0 to 1,200 rpm. This translates to quick, versatile drilling and driving.

At the heart of this drill&apos;s performance is a patented DEWALT-built motor that generates 50 percent more power than a standard motor of the same size. It also provides increased overload protection for extended tool life.

Designed for Versatility and Durability
As versatile as it is powerful, the DWD210G functions well for both steel and wood applications. When working with a spade or auger bit in wood, it offers a 1-1/2-inch capacity, and it can handle a capacity of 2-9/16 inches when used with a self-feed unit. The drill can also handle a 1/2-inch twist bit when working with steel. When used with a hole saw, the drill offers a 3-5/8-inch capacity in wood and a 2-inch capacity in steel.

Its keyed 1/2-inch chuck grips the bit securely to prevent slippage, and a metal gear housing provides added durability.

Built with Comfortable, Accurate Handling in Mind
Comfortable handling goes a long way toward ensuring accurate results. The DWD210G is built with an ergonomic grip, and its two-finger rubber trigger makes power control easy. A locking, 360-degree, soft-grip side handle gives you hand-position options for improved user comfort and better overall command of the drill. And it weighs an easy-to-manage 4.9 pounds, decreasing user fatigue after extended use.

The DWD210G 1/2-Inch VSR Pistol-Grip Drill comes with a DEWALT warranty package that includes a three-year limited warranty, a one-year free service contract, and a 90-day money-back guarantee.

What&apos;s in the Box

 neighbor suing over some cut trees 
 Added on : Thursday June 07th 2012 09:00:49 AM Posting this on behalf of my dad. I&apos;m married and long moved out of my parent&apos;s home. My dad is 86. I realize that doesn&apos;t excuse anything he did below, but PLEASE go easy on me, I realize what he did was wrong, but for those of you with older parents/grandparents you probably realize sometimes older people don&apos;t listen to wise advice and can be stubborn. He didn&apos;t stop when I strongly suggested he do so.OK.... that aside.....My parent&apos;s backyard abuts perpendicular to another property&apos;s backyard. While my parent&apos;s lot is a typical suburban 120&apos; or so, the other guy has something like 700&apos; of property depth, so his side property line runs alongside my parent&apos;s property and several other of my parent&apos;s neighbors.The stretch of his yard that abuts my parents is near the back of his property, maybe 400&apos; from his back patio. As you can imagine, he never uses his &quot;way back&quot; yard. He&apos;s older and barely gets to mow what grass is back there. In fact he tried to parcel it off and sell it to the people on my parent&apos;s street a few years ago so they&apos;d have longer lots. My parents and their neighbors listened to the offer, but it was above market, not a fair offer, and they passed on it without even countering.So in his &quot;way back&quot; yard, he doesn&apos;t do much landscaping, pruning, etc. (Of course, he doesn&apos;t have to, it&apos;s his yard to do whatever he so chooses with.) Unfortunately, it drove my dad nuts to see this wildly overgrown patch just beyond his property line. Against my advice and my mom&apos;s, he went in there and cleared out some brush, trimmed some trees, etc. Neighbor called the police and had a report done.Court summons came yesterday. Dad is being charged with:
1. Criminal Damaging - which is a misdemeanor of the second degree carrying up to 90 days jail / $750 fine, and,
2. Criminal Trespass - which is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree carrying up to 30 days jail / $250 fine.My dad is a clean guy, no record with the law, never been sued (civil or criminal) before.I myself have no court experience except for a speeding ticket a decade ago.Some questions running through my mind:
1. Should he bother getting a lawyer? I can&apos;t see the judge throwing the book at my dad. I&apos;m guessing no jail time and maybe $500 fine?? If we don&apos;t get a lawyer, I need to go help him because he&apos;s hard of hearing.2. Would any monetary damage to the neighbor be handled at this court appearance? Besides the fines which I believe go to the state (is that correct?), could a civil penalty be added that gets paid to the neighbor at this same court appearance? If not -- I assume the neighbor might be planning a civil suit in small claims as well, is that a fair statement?3. Perhaps there won&apos;t be a civil case, because what kind of value can random wild bushes or small oak trees that he didn&apos;t intentionally plant possess? His bigger trees &quot;planted&quot; these smaller trees over the decades.4. My dad has pictures of the overgrown mess before he cleaned it up. I realize that legally these pictures only prove how much he did in fact trespass and did in fact &apos;damage&apos;, but would a judge look at my dad and these photos, and at his age perhaps sympathize that my dad&apos;s intentions weren&apos;t malicious, and in reality, the &apos;damage&apos; that has been done has caused the neighbor zero harm. To some eyes the landscape work probably raised the value of his property an (inconsequentially) small amount.5. Continuing with the &quot;sympathy&quot; angle when we appear before the judge, should we mention that the neighbor might be annoyed that his offer to sell the property was rejected? He very well might be ticked at my dad and the others for ignoring his offer to sell.6. When the police report was filed and the police came to document everything, they did &quot;snoop&quot; with the neighbor in my dad&apos;s back yard. Looking at what he had stored next to his tool shed, looking through his pile of firewood and lumber. I know it&apos;s neither here nor there, but, I don&apos;t see why they needed to do this.7. Since this is a criminal case, does my neighbor do the talking, or does the city attorney handle all talking during court?8. Any use talking to the neighbor to see if they&apos;d drop the case for a settlement? Can they even drop it, at this point? The court summons reads &quot;The State of&lt;&gt;, City of&lt;&gt;VS.&lt;my dad&gt;&quot;. What about showing up early and trying to make a deal with the prosecutor, or sending him a certified letter ahead of time??Any other suggestions at all?I&apos;ll say it again - YES I and my dad know it was 100% legally wrong and that there is no justification that would permit doing what he did. The question is how to proceed.Thanks!!

 Starting a new career, too late, too risky? 
 Added on : Friday June 01st 2012 02:00:45 PM I&apos;ve been an electrical engineering technician working with particle accelerators for about 7 years. I&apos;m very good with electronics and have moved from a technician role to an engineer role (without the title). For having a 2 year degree, my pay is quite good - around 78K including 5K overtime. There is not much room for me to improve that number without significant overtime. Overtime is available, and I could earn as much as my willingness to work overtime allows. I&apos;ve also been moonlighting in physics classes, and will receive my BS in physics soon. I enjoy school and would like to get a master&apos;s degree. I was considering accelerator physics, but the job prospects are very narrow for that field. That&apos;s why I&apos;m considering theraputic medical physics (think a radiation pharmacist for cancer patients). Nearly every clinic and mid sized hospital has one, large hospitals have a team. A board certified physicist earns about 120K-150K to start, with income potential of 200K+. It will take me 4 years to finish the program while working full time, plus 2 years of residency with annual salary of ~50K during the residency. Right now, there is a bottleneck in residency slots with too many applicants, many who are armed with a PhD. If I don&apos;t get into a residency after spending 4 years to get the masters degree, I may never be board certified, limiting my earning to the low 100K range. By the time I might finish a residency, I will be 35. That still gives me 30 years in the field. I know many doctors start their career that late in life, but their earning potential may be significantly higher. My employer pays for all tuition and books so far, and will pay for my master&apos;s degree. I have a 5K in student loans in deferrment left over from my technical school. The master&apos;s program will essentially be free, only costing me my free time, after which I will take a 30K a year pay cut for 2 years. DW can likely fill that gap as she is a school teacher, but that may be difficult with one or more small children. I will either have to rent out or short sell my house because I&apos;m 30K underwater and there is not a residency program near me (Las Vegas). PITI is $1600, rental income would be about $1400 minus management fee.I&apos;ve looked through physics forums for this type of question and primarily find the thread turns into an academic pissing contest. I&apos;m not writing this post to get affirmation for a decision I&apos;ve already made, but rather input as to whether it is worth it to pursue this course, whether the risks are too great, and if I&apos;m starting in a new field too late in life. Cliff notes for those TLDR folks:
I want to start a new career that requires a master&apos;s degree and may more than double my salary. I will be 35 by the time I finish. The field requires board certification, which I may never get. In that case, that limits me to perhaps only a 50% increase in salary. I&apos;m not paying for the education. Is it worth it in terms of investment of my time, and perhaps having to short sell my house?

 Hit and run accident, then chase and run driver. 
 Added on : Thursday May 31st 2012 03:00:49 PM So I had a crappy time last week. I was driving my car, and was rear ended by an Ford F250. The driver asked us to pull over to exchange info, and when we did they took off. I chased them, and caught up to them at a Body Shop. They went inside and disappeared on foot. Cops show up, did there walk in a circle, stated the drive was not there, and left (amazing detective work for a 350lb man). Later I find out driver was not the owner of the car. The owner left the car with the Body Shop to sell. The good news is that because the owner gave permission, the owners insurance (Geico) will cover my loss/damages. Both myself and my passenger suffered what we believe is bad whiplash and are seeing chiropractors. This occurred in WA state.Now I have no health or PIP protection so I am paying out of pocket up front for my treatment which kind of sucks. 9-12mo is what the chiropractor expects for a time frame. The good news is that I have enough cash on hand to cover what I expect my bills to run, and my passenger had PIP on her policy so she is golden for at least 10k. Now this is my first accident where I have been hurt, and I was hoping for some constructive advice. I know I can get a lawyer to deal with the insurance CO, but I would prefer not to give up 30%. I really would like enough money to cover the bills, and a reasonable bit for pain/suffering as I miss being able to turn my head more than 90 degrees. Questions I had right off the top of my head is can I find out the owner&apos;s coverage limits? If I exceed these limits does my under insured on my auto policy cover for pain and suffering theoretically? Um, and all the other things I should be asking but am currently ignorant to.Thanks for your thoughts. Harman Kardon BDS 800 5.1 Channel Blu-ray Home Theater Systems $748 + FS @ wwstereo

Make every night movie night.
The BDS 800 is a fully loaded home theater system that comes with a Blu-ray Disc receiver, a DVD/CD player, Dolby Digital and DTS decoding, an HDMI output, a USB port for importing music, video and picture files, and a preprogrammed/learning remote control that helps facilitate easy setup. There are no extras you need to buy. With everything necessary to turn ordinary film or TV viewing into an extraordinary experience, the BDS 800 is a complete system that transforms home entertainment into something you must normally leave the house to enjoy.

Dcor-complementing design.
It might sound strange to hear someone compliment your home theater system on its surprising good looks, but with the BDS 800, its a distinct possibility. With its modern, high-style design, the BDS 800s aesthetics are as expertly crafted as whatever youre watching on screen making it the perfect fit for most bookshelves, countertops or home entertainment centers.

Sublime Dolby sound quality.
The BDS 800 is a complete home theater audio system. One special feature is Dolby Digital and DTS surround-sound decoding, which allows you to hear every nuance of the latest movie soundtrack including Dolby and DTS high-resolution soundtracks in their native formats. This way, you and your friends can enjoy a surround-sound movie experience that is completely faithful to what its creator intended.

Crystal clear HDMI perfection.
If youre going to invest in a system with the extensive capabilities of the BDS 800, youll want the best high-definition picture and sound quality possible. Thankfully, with HDMI output, youll have it. By delivering HD digital video and high-resolution audio at the highest level possible (up to 1080p), the BDS 800 allows you to experience each frame of Hollywood action as it was shot without quality loss due to conversion or compression of a video or audio signal.

A single system for all your entertainment.
Imagine a home theater system that can play every song, video, or picture that you send its way while its hooked up to your TV. Serving as a true multimedia device, the BDS 800 can play sophisticated formats such as Blu-ray Disc or DVD video or casual, matter-of-fact videos shot on your iPhone device via the USB port. Simply attach a device such as a flash drive to the front-panel USB port, and watch your media manifest before your eyes. Thats all it takes: One cable, and youre instantly watching MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MP3, WMA and JPEG files with greater quality than is possible on your computer screen.

Compact, powered subwoofer.
Far from bulky, the compact BDS 800 subwoofer fits unobtrusively into your life. Yet its hard not to notice, thanks to its impressive output, acoustic loading and down-firing sealed enclosure in close proximity to the floor, creating tight, powerful bass performance. In addition, the glossy black BDS empowers you with volume, phase and bass-boost controls, so you can always create your ideal listening environment. The subwoofer also has an automatic turn-on and shut-off capability that responds intuitively to audio signals, so the system saves you not just time but energy as well.

Take control with preprogrammed/learning remote.
Theres nothing more frustrating than a coffee table stacked with more remote controls than coffee-table books. Thats why the BDS 800 simplifies your life with a single, adept remote control that can synchronize and coordinate your TV, cable boxes, satellite tuners and home theater system. And the BDS 800s on-screen menu makes setting up and using the system even easier.

Dynamic digital-amplifier technology.
In so many ways, going digital has great benefits. The same goes for the digital amplifier that comes with the BDS 800 home theater system. With the BDS 800, you can keep your audio signal smooth by keeping it in the digital domain from the sound source to the amplifier output and avoid audio artifacts that pop up in converting sound from analog to digital and vice versa. By using digital-amplifier technology, the BDS 800 keeps its receiver size small to ensure that your system generates less heat than others a benefit that allows you to minimize your carbon footprint.

Four identical two-way satellite speakers.
Sound quality, fidelity and consistency have been hallmarks of harman kardon speaker systems for 60 years. These signature traits are still in full effect, as the BDS 800 speaker system demonstrates. With a two-way, dual-driver configuration that lowers distortion for clear sound even at high volumes, the BDS 800 moves sounds consistently and realistically among speakers, drawing you into the movie experience while keeping your attention at every turn.

Dedicated, two-way dual-driver center speaker.
Voice-matched to the four satellite speakers, the dedicated center speaker provides heightened realism, clear dialogue and sound thats consistent with the other speakers for a faithful and immersive movie experience. In addition, the dual midrange drivers let you achieve maximum clarity even at high volumes. So, ultimately, when it comes to that climactic action sequence, no distortion will ever interrupt your suspended disbelief.

Gain extensive connectivity through multiple inputs.
With three digital inputs and two line outputs, the BDS 800 gives you great flexibility in mixing and matching other systems. And even though the BDS 800 provides everything youll need for a stellar home theater system, you can expand it by using multiple audio sources at any time. In addition, the BDS 800 also offers extensive connectivity in ways that more limited systems can only dream of. It even has an Ethernet port that allows you to connect to the Internet via your local area network, so you can take advantage of BD-Live interactivity a next-generation technology that allows you to import your own programming using MP3, WMA and JPEG playback.

Enhanced display features with energy-saving technology.
In addition to a dot-matrix information display that communicates freely with you to deliver status messages, the BDS 800 receiver lets you play music without having to turn on the TV. This forward-thinking feature saves energy. Additionally, a screensaver function prevents image burn-in on CRT and plasma displays. As a nod to its MP3 player technology, the BDS 800 even has a cover-art display function for audio files with ID3 tags (from USB devices). This way, you can see what youre playing. What could be more convenient?

Improve the quality of your connections.
You can never have too secure a cable connection for preventing unwanted interruptions. Thats why the BDS 800 has heavy-duty, gold-plated, binding-post speaker connectors to help you achieve the strongest connection and drastically minimize the likelihood of distortion or interference. The flexible BDS 800 system is also compatible with a variety of speaker wires, accepting banana connectors, spade connectors, pin connectors, bare wire and, likely, any other connectors you choose. Theres also a detachable IEC power cord that lets you connect to the installation site with ease simplifying the connection process even before you install the unit.

Magnetically shielded transducers.
When youre immersed in your favorite movie or TV show, theres nothing worse than unexpected interruptions. With magnetically shielded transducers designed to eliminate picture interference and distortion, the BDS system allows you to place your speakers close to the TV screen or wherever best complements your dcor to achieve the best possible picture and sound quality. The BDS 800 even has flat-panel midrange transducers of a honeycomb design with carbon-fiber skin, which deliver better sound quality than conventional transducers. And thanks to a 2-1/2-way crossover network that improves the transition between midrange and high-frequency drivers, you can expect very natural, transparent sound.

Intuitive playlist memory.
Its nice to have a home entertainment system that remembers your favorite songs. With playlist functionality that stores the locations of your most frequently used media, the BDS 800 system makes it easy for you to play files stored on a USB device or CD-R with a minimum of button pushing. Its one thing to be able to listen to your home theater system, but when it listens to you, isnt that a nice bonus?

Be system ready for upgrades.
Keep your receivers performance up to date with the latest software for improved operation, at the moment when upgrades become available, via the on-screen display (OSD). Using your OSD, you can simplify the upgrade process and ensure that your BDS 800 receiver is consistently running up to speed with the latest technology and meeting its great potential.

Going solo.
Sometimes when youre watching a sporting event or movie in your living room late at night using the BDS 800s 5.1-channel speaker system, those sleeping in the other rooms (not to mention the neighbors) can get swept up in the excitement whether they want to or not. Thats why the BDS 800 comes with a headphone jack, so you can enjoy your very own private listening experience and not have to worry that sound is traveling outside your four walls.

 What to look for in a gap year program? 
 Added on : Monday May 28th 2012 11:00:49 PM Situation: A particular gap year program (between the high school and 1st year in college) * costs slightly less than the total cost of 1 year of attendance at a local University, and* awards 30 credits that the local University confirms are transferable (there were precedents). These credits are equivalent to a year of coursework at a University.
I think that it should be possible to apply the credits from the gap year and complete the undergraduate degree in a University in 3 years. What are the possible traps or things to watch for? e.g. tax treatment?credits may not be applied to a major, only to electives?

 Tuition Free Colleges 
 Added on : Sunday May 27th 2012 01:18:17 AM I was reading about tuition-free colleges in newsweek and thought that there must be additional places to attend an institution of higher education (college) at no cost.http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/11/1114_tuitionfree/index_0...A quick search turned up this information for those interested in studying abroad in Norway:&quot;Nothing is for free&quot; is a saying that is true in many cases. But in Norway it is possible to get quality education without having to pay tuition fees. If certain prerequisites are met you could also be eligible for financial support that can pay for your living expenses. Through various fellowship programmes, scholarship schemes or student loans, international students can receive funding for a full degree or a limited number of semesters. http://www.studyinnorway.no/sn/Tuition-ScholarshipsAny others?

 Added on : Thursday May 17th 2012 09:32:23 PM This seemed like a good deal for me so I picked one up yesterday. The website seems to have removed the price from last night, but I picked this up in store $398 including 2 pairs of 3d passive glasses. Website showed $398 so I called my store to check stock and price (as WalMart often has different pricing than their website and refuses to pricematch themselves) and they told me they had 4 in stock at the same price. I went and picked it up and tested Thor 3d on my ps3 and it looks great.The website has not changed and shows only in stores, but if you call ahead they should hold (mine did):
Walmart LinkOn another note the website shows it comes with a qwerty keyboard and a premium and basic pair of glasses (as well as visio&apos;s website), however it came w/ 2 basic pairs of passive glasses and no qwerty keyboard. I called visio today and they will be sending me
the new remote and a premium pair of glasses (no hassle they were super nice about it), since this is what their website showed as well.You can&apos;t order this online as of this afternoon but you can order this bundle still at $459 including an hdmi cable and soundbar.

VIZIO Warranty One Year Parts&amp;Labor; Free Lifetime Technical SupportWalmart Coupons Negotiating higher salary (job offer / counter offer) 
 Added on : Thursday May 17th 2012 09:15:15 PM Hi all,A little background. I&apos;ve been a Co-op (basically an intern) at an software engineering company while in University for the past 2 years. My total amount of time worked there is a year plus 3 months of full-time interning. I&apos;ve been on the same team every time I came back for co-op. The company wanted to ensure that I would stick around, so they created a full-time entry level position for me. I just finished the interview for that, which was more of a technicality than anything. The HR person I had talked to asked me what I had thought about compensation, if I had any general numbers. I expect competitive salary, and I know that the company does give competitive salary and benefits. The median salary for the job (via salary.com) in my part of the country is $56,588. I wasn&apos;t even expecting to have any salary talk since this was the first round of interviews. But I gave my cards up early and when asked, I gave an intentionally high number of about 10k more than the median salary. She responded by saying that&apos;s high and I should expect &quot;60-ish&quot; (her words). I&apos;m confident that my non-verbal cues gave off that I wasn&apos;t particularly impressed with this number.I will be receiving an offer letter some time next week. I&apos;m preparing for having 60k on the offer letter. What I was expecting was more around 64 or 65k (which is why I threw out a high number to begin with). Assuming the offer is lower than what I desire, how do I go about negotiating a counter offer from here? This is my first major job in my career, and I don&apos;t want to be like a typical entry level candidate and accept whatever first offer I receive.Some of the pluses here, as far as my negotiation goes:
- 75th percentile salary is $63,416, so I would expect at least 62 to be competitive (am I wrong for expecting this?).
- I&apos;ve been working for this team for 1 year and 3 months already. They know I fit well with the team and they know I have the skills needed. On this note, I know a lot about the specifics of the job already as I&apos;ve been with the company. I would expect my experience with the company and the benefit this gives the team to be reflected in the number (Competitive + X, X being that extra I&apos;m worth since they know I fit well and work hard).
- This position was created for me. No other candidates have been interviewed, and I doubt that they&apos;d really want to go looking for another candidate. Some of the negatives:
- I don&apos;t finish my degree until December. I will be starting for them full-time in the near future assuming I accept an offer. I&apos;m also finishing school full-time while working for them full-time. They know I don&apos;t graduate until December, so they would likely also know that it&apos;s very doubtful that I&apos;m receiving tons of offers at the moment.While I realize I don&apos;t have a lot of wiggle room since I haven&apos;t graduated yet, as a true FW&apos;er I want to be sure to get the best base salary entering my career as I can. Bonuses, raises, and various other compensation are all percentages of base salary. So If I negotiate this base salary higher, it will reflect in a lot of different ways. That being said, they can easily go hire a graduate with a BS to fill the position. He wouldn&apos;t have the experience working with the team in particular that I have, but he would have a degree (and potential other experience).This is all preventative thinking, especially considering I haven&apos;t seen the actual offer letter. I can let you guys know the specifics of how generous other parts of the compensation plan look when I receive the offer. Any and all tips are appreciated, thanks! P.S.: I&apos;ve considered asking for a crown vic as part of the compensation package (company car ), even though I already have a perfectly fine 04 Civic.

 Added on : Monday April 30th 2012 09:04:08 PM Hello FWF,A few months ago, my fiance&apos;s great uncle passed away and his house was left to his three nephews(he had no kids of his own). One of the nephews is my fiance&apos;s father. They are planning on selling the house and said that they would like for it to stay with somebody in the family. House appraised for ~159k and they are willing to sell to somebody in the family for 130k.Facts:
-We are both 24, college grads
-Combined income is ~60k (she is first year out of education degree, noble but not high pay)
-She has no debt, I have ~38k student loan debt
-I have limited credit history, she has essentially no history
-10k in savings
My question is what is the likelihood that we will qualify for a mortgage (FHA, etc.) and what might be our best options to proceed with this situation? I am not too familiar with regulations regarding purchases within the family, etc. Any advice would be helpful, thanks all! Graduating in May - Deciding on job / living arrangements 
 Added on : Monday April 30th 2012 09:04:06 PM I&apos;ll be graduating in May with a degree in Marketing and Finance with 2 years of internship experience in the marketing/communications fields. I have a few good job prospects (three of which I just finished 2nd round interviews).I don&apos;t know the exact salaries being offered, but I know they are in the low to mid 40&apos;s (I&apos;d assume 41-46k). I am from the Chicagoland area and all these positions are located in the suburbs. I grew up and my parents are still in the western suburbs. Anyways, I&apos;m trying to figure out what to do as far as savings / living expenses. One of the positions is located about 20-25 minutes from my parents house. I already have discussed with them the possibility of living at home for a year or so. We haven&apos;t come up with a solid number, but $500/month for food/utilities/rent seemed to stick out in our discussion. This would save around $600/month if I rented by myself. The other two positions are located 50-60 minutes away, assuming traffic is flowing, if not, then 75-80 minutes each way. I wouldn&apos;t mind that commute over the summer, but in the winter, I wouldn&apos;t want to do it. I&apos;m an active person (I run and bike a lot), so spending two hours in a car a day when I could be using that extra hour to work out seems wasted. Also, with the two other jobs, I would be incurring an extra $150/month in toll and gas expenses.I&apos;ve thrown this example budget, assuming I live on my own. If I can find a roommate (which I would like to do), I would take that option, lowering my monthly expenses by around $300/month. I&apos;m not sure what I would do with the excess income. Probably save 50% of it, and then maybe use the leftover for short-term savings. I have about $18,000 in the market/bank with no debt. Am I missing anything that stands out?

 Added on : Sunday April 29th 2012 09:09:53 AM http://www.frys.com/product/5885253Says shipping is unavailable, but my local B&amp;M;had them. Granted, it&apos;s not the Stage, but it is still an ESL. I&apos;ve demo&apos;d it a few times, incredibly airy and detailed, but with most ML ESL&apos;s, very directional. Get out of the field, and it sucks. Damn nice center for anyone with ESLs that need timbre matching, and these things typically do $600-$750 used easily. This is a quality ESL, before ML got on their big box store focus.http://www.martinlogan.com/products/matineeMatinee is a highly evolved expression of the same ideas and engineering that spawned the Stage and Motif speakers. A state-of-the-art MicroPerf electrostatic panel, dual paper-cone woofers, and highly sophisticated Vojtko crossover deliver unrivaled precision and center-channel intelligibility. Wall-mount brackets and an optional pivoting stand with 35 degrees of motion (sold seperately) allow Matinee to work as either a center or surround speaker, mounted on- or off-wall, horizontally or vertically. Only a handful of speakers match or outperform the Matinee in any of these applications, and none outpace it in all of them Craftsman 3 pc.

 Added on : Tuesday April 24th 2012 06:10:53 AM I have a 2 year-running, local service professional (one man operating) business. I graduated from Academy of Arts University in 2005 (AA degree in Computer arts) and I created my own website to advertise, plus optimized my website to top spot of Google which brings in good traffic/clientele. I made 90k last year and on my way to make over 100k this year. I&apos;m a 31 year old father to my sweet 4 month old son and husband to a beautiful 26 year old stay-at-home wife. I&apos;m renting a 2 story home which costs $2150/mo (not the best money saver) and paying off two vehicles this year. Everything looks fine and dandy right? Wrong.From 2005 (graduation day) to 2010 I was in and out of low-income jobs. I couldn&apos;t pay back my school loan of 20K+. My credit score is terrible-- mid 500s. My wife has bad credit as well. We have Wells Fargo with a savings of 15k and climbing. Next year we&apos;re aiming to buy a home. Which leads to my questions: Which is the best way to use my 15k savings NOW to start building my credit score and possibly start investing my money into something? Is it best to pay off the FAFSA school loan asap to rebuild my credit score or over a period of time ie. months or years? Plus I want to start saving/investing my money. Any links or info there? A starting place would be great... actually any information that helps would be great. If you can, please list links and guides that can help me become financially wealthy. Thanks.

I have this one and here is my review:
Pros: Size, power usage, Ethernet and wireless,sdhc slot, 6 usb ports.Cons: HEAT All they need to do is add another fan at the intake side of the box to help push air through. Or do the mod I did. For the bios headache, they really need to add a bios update configuration in the bios.Put a spacer on the bottom of the unit, right below the processor, the bottom of the unit gets extremely hot, the plastic case actually turned milky, I had it without air space on the bottom of the case.Other Thoughts: I tried the unebottin and it would not run on the USB (cd error). Go through the reviews at Newegg and find a link to where you get the HP USB formatter and Win 98 to create a bootable USB then copy updated bios files to usb. That worked for me updating the bios. HEAT, watching videos (using Cyberlink to upscale from 720 video to 1080 P) the temps hovered around 175 F degrees on HDTV. I cut a hole on the cover above the cooling fan and put a Laptop usb fan on top. That dropped the temps down to 145 degrees F running the processor at 100% for 1 hour idle temp is now 112 D F instead of 130 D F. EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT. I am also going to use brazostweaker to lower the voltage which will drop temps even more. I have used brazostweaker on my HP DM1Z and it dropped temps another 10 degrees F (have not done it yet on Foxconn model. This Gskill memory worked fine on the unit. N82E16820231341 (4 gig module around 20 bucs at Newegg)
Also please note: supposedly the wireless was terrible but a review states that the 2 wires that are connected to the wireless card (black and white wire) wrong way and all you have to do is switch the connection to correct the problem( I use the ethernet port so I have not tried wireless yet).
Do not try to run version 8 bios update in windows, if it runs (I was getting an error) it can brick the motherboard (supposedly UAC blocks some of the writing to the bios) You have to use a usb bootable flash either using Unebootin or HP USB formatter and Win 98.For an HTPC I am very satisfied, I also got the Logitech K400 wireless keyboard with touchpad (I do not know if Amazon still has it for 29 bucs)Newegg Coupons Zmodo 4 camera DVR $99.99 newegg fs

 Added on : Wednesday April 04th 2012 03:13:51 PM Hello Fatwallet!I have a 20-something brother-in-law finally graduating from college with a degree in business and would like to get him some sort of gift to make his transition to the real world a bit smoother. Straight cash is not in the mix as with most 20 somethings, he is not too good with money (yet). My first thought was something like a Sharebuilder Starter Kit with some extra $100 sharebuilder gift cards to start him in the right direction. Any creative ideas within a budget of say, $500.00, please share!BTW.....wife won&apos;t spring for H&amp;B;(my first choice).

 Added on : Monday March 26th 2012 09:03:31 AM Hi everyone,I have accepted a one-year internship at a good company that I will need to re-locate for. I am considering houses at $130K and below. The internship will pay 60K for that one year. At the conclusion of the internship, I will have earned my BS degree and would hope to be hired on by the company that I intern at, but there is no guarantee of that (supposedly, the company hires on about half of all interns that still want full-time employment after the internship&apos;s conclusion.)My question is, what sort of response should I expect from the banks if I try to obtain a mortgage (before the start of the internship) given the fixed-term income? Can I expect that banks will pre-approve me, or is there no chance of that? I would be the only person on the mortgage. I am asking here first because it might be a waste of time for me to assemble all of the documentation that they require to process the application only to find out that I didn&apos;t stand a chance of being approved in the first place. I have not yet reached out to any banks to ask about this yet because I currently already have a mortgage (house is already up on the market to sell.) As a result of my current mortgage, I&apos;m thinking that my debt-to-income ratio would likely be too high - especially considering the fact that I am currently unemployed, plus they&apos;d have to use my projected income. If required (and also to avoid PMI), I could make a 20% downpayment on the new mortgage plus pay the closing costs, but I&apos;m not sure if that will even make a difference in getting approved.Has anyone else ever tried to get a mortgage under similar circumstances?It is very much cheaper to own then to rent in the Sacramento area (where I&apos;ll be moving to.) Although house prices in Sacramento could potentially go lower in the short-term, I think that I would get a good return on my investment in the long run (30 years) by taking a mortgage. If I were to get a loan from family, I could potentially pay cash for a house, but I could not borrow from them for 30 years in the same way that I could from a bank. Thus, my monthly payments on a family loan might be $1500 or $2000 per month (too much) vs only $500 a month for a mortgage.TIA.edit: I forgot to mention that if I find myself unemployed after the end of the internship, I&apos;d have enough in savings to live off of until finding my next job. I would not sell the house. Victorinox Seefeld 25&quot; or 28&quot; Expandable Suitcase with 360 Degree Rotating Handle $105 Shipped @ D/S

 Added on : Monday March 19th 2012 09:07:35 PM If you knew you were going back to school, what could you do to tax advantage of your situation.Here are a few ideas, please critique and add:
-Roth IRA is even more appealing (convert IRA if possible?)
-Should you cash in equities in a gain position? Reasoning: pay any gains at the lower tax bracket and possible 0% for long term gains. (Is it wise to just rebuy the stock afterwards?)
-Of course accelerate/defer any income to the year you are not working (Any ideas of what to do?)
-American Opportunity Tax Credit ($2,500 tax credit) for first 4 years past high-school
-Lifetime learning Credit ($2,000 tax credit)
-Page-1 Deduction (up to $4,000) If you don&apos;t do either credits aboveMy specific situation: I might be going back to school full time for a graduate degree. I have enough savings to last the 2 years in school. This is a very rare time that i will have very little to no income coming in so i want to take full advantage for tax purposes.Thanks for the inputs! Fujitsu Q550 Slate - Windows 7 - $499 + FS

 Added on : Tuesday March 13th 2012 06:08:36 AM Can anyone share any good career paths, or fields, that pay well, and can commonly be obtained through self teaching, and/or proof of knowledge, rather than simply requiring a degree?This would really benefit people such as myself, and other similar people. I am a very quick and proficient self learner. I&apos;m especially skillful at technical, mechanical, logical, scientific, and computer tech type things (not so skilled with artistic and sociological type things). I want to explore possible new career paths, however college is simply out of the question at this point, or any time in the near future.There are so many resources for learning, from the internet, to the library, to various free open source online classes, which claim to teach courses that are completely equivalent to the college counterparts, but unfortunately don&apos;t offer an actual degree. With all these resources it should be very easy for someone to gain the equivalent or greater knowledge of a college graduate on their own for free, on their own schedule, rather than incurring massive debt to do so. The question is, are there any fields where it is actually common practice for employers to hire people based on their actual skills, rather than closing the door to anyone who doesn&apos;t hold a degree? A field where someone could start studying with a good level of confidence that they will have a very good chance of landing a job as soon as they become competent in that field?One example, I have once heard that computer programming is a field in which someone can self study an in demand programming language, and if they are good at it, they will be in high demand, and likely get hired making good money. If anyone could elaborate on this I&apos;d like to hear, as well as any other good examples of careers that can be obtained this way? As well as any other good related resources of advice would be appreciated.Thanks. Career Advice? 
 Added on : Monday March 12th 2012 06:04:05 AM I&apos;m a 25 year old student majoring in accounting with no debt due to the Post 9/11 GI Bill.
Currently I&apos;m a senior that just needs 18 hours to graduate with a BBA in accounting.
My overall GPA is around 3.32 with no outside organization involvement or activities.
From my GPA you can tell I don&apos;t have much ambition or motivation.I pretty much hate school and just go since I get paid BAH every month. In fact I never wanted to attend
college in the first place, but I happened to have fell into the complacency of
the monthly BAH payments. I haven&apos;t acquired an internship yet however I do plan on it. I thought about doing security contracting and working on oil rigs in North Dakota or Texas if I decide
to quit school. At this point, it doesn&apos;t seem worth it at all. If someone offered me a 60k a year job
with benefits, I drop school in a heartbeat. At the end of the day I just want a job that&apos;s secure and
decent paying. I&apos;m don&apos;t see myself climbing the corporate ladder very far. I figured if I find a spot I like at a company, I&apos;ll try my best to stay in that particular position.
I don&apos;t really have any desire whatsoever for continuing education past my bachelor&apos;s degree.
Since I&apos;m in Texas, I also have the Hazelwood Act to cover 150 hours of college after I use up my
current benefits,so I don&apos;t need any type of tuition reimbursement. So what are my job prospects
like with my current info? Of course I have no interest in working with the Big 4 accounting firms.
I imagine I could at least start out in the 45-55k range? Basically my plan is to go with
a) accounting and find a job in that field using my degree
b) law enforcement (Cops get paid around 50k a year here and can make OT.)
c) contracting for a company like Dynacorp for PSS (Former Marine Corps infantry experience)
d) Oil rig work Any advice regarding my situation is appreciated. Please be as critical as possible.

 Added on : Wednesday February 29th 2012 03:33:41 PM TexteBay Coupons Direct Student Loan Borrowing 
 Added on : Tuesday February 28th 2012 09:22:41 PM I need to convert my FFEL loans into Direct Loans so I can qualify for the Public Loan Forgiveness Program. My Question is who is the best provider (servicer) to work with the best rates? I have read many webpages and forums,and it seems like I have gone in circles with varying degrees of information. Now I am totally confused!!Any input greatly appreciated!!! Is the Average income really 70K in the King County area of Washington? 
 Added on : Monday February 27th 2012 09:18:24 PM I&apos;ve been doing a lot of salary research and I&apos;m trying to figure out if 70k is really the average working person&apos;s income in King County and nearby areas.I&apos;ve looked at many different sources from census data, to government sites, to career sites, to wikipedia, to city stats etc, and figures seem to be very widely ranging. Sometimes they go by &quot;per capita&quot; income, which does not seem very accurate, and would produce lower figures since it includes all the old retired people, and very young adults, and people who do not work, etc. Other times average incomes seem like they may be skewed, for example if Bill Gates income is factored in, everyone is skewed. Other sources list &quot;household&quot; income. All in all, it seems like the average person&apos;s income is around $70K.But is that really the average? It just seems too high. None of my friends make anywhere near that. I&apos;ve looked at a lot of colleges placement figures, whatever ones I can find that actually have placement salary info, and the vast majority of them, it seems that even students who got a 2-4 year degree, even many times with a STEM degree, get placed making around $17-$19 an hour. On the L&amp;I;labor statistics pages, the vast majority of average incomes are well less than that (although I think they might average throughout the whole US). I work in heavy duty construction, and I &quot;can potentially&quot; make around that much if employed year round (tough in this economy where construction has tanked), but it comes at the price of your health and breaking down your body.If 70K is really the average income, where the heck are all these $70K-$120K and above jobs hiding that statistically should make up about half the jobs out there? Because 99% of the jobs I ever see are jobs that pay $25K-$50K. 55&quot; LCD 1080p 120hz 3 HDMI input Seiki at Sears $699

 Added on : Sunday February 26th 2012 06:49:07 AM http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-system-set-persuade-ebook/dp/B...Years ago, when you were about four
years old, the system set out to persuade
you of something that isnt true.
Not just persuade, but drill, practice, reinforce and, yes, brainwash.
The mission: to teach you that youre average; That compliant work is the best way to a reliable
living; That creating average stuff for average people, again and again, is a safe and easy way
to get what you want.
Step out of line and the system would nudge (or push) you back to the center. Show signs
of real creativity, originality or even genius, and well-meaning parents, teachers and authority
figures would eagerly line up to get you back in line.
Our culture needed compliant workers, people who would contribute without complaint,
and we set out to create as many of them as we could.
And so generations of students turned into generations of cogsfactory workers in search
of a sinecure. We were brainwashed into fitting in, and then discovered that the economy wanted
people who stood out instead.
When exactly were we brainwashed into believing that the best way to earn a living is to have a job?
I think each one of us needs to start with that.
Over time, the benefit of working for the man and following a manual as a compliant cog is going
to go down, while, paradoxically, the difficulty in getting a decent job will go up.
We just lived through a few generations of huge companies that got bigger, giant bureaucracies
that got bigger and white-collar jobs that got farther and farther away from actually making
something that a customer might buy.
And then, pretty suddenly, that faded. Unemployment goes up, downsizing happens, layers of fat
disappear and the idea that you could get a good job, indoors, paid well, doing not much except
watching the dog that bites the pilot if he messes with the autopilot... well, those jobs are gone.
Is that it? Are you done? Is this the end of the road, the best its going to get, the beginning
of the end?
Same job, but more work, less pay.
Same industry, but less growth, no challenges.
Same path, fewer options.
Its entirely possible that youve trudged as far as you can go on this road, and that the slog is
just going to be more of the same. Possible.
But I dont believe it.
Why?
Because theres more leverage, more degrees of freedom and more opportunity today than ever
beforeif youre up for the choice.
The new industrial revolution (the one were living through, the one thats changing everything) has
opened doors for anyone (or certainly anyone with enough resources and education to be able to
read this document). If youve got the time, the intellect and the access to get your hands on an idea
that spread as this manifesto did, then you have the ability to reinvent yourself, regardless of what
you do, who you do it with, or what the people around you expect.
The pillars we grew up with (things like General Motors, TV, the postal service, retirement, top
down media and commodities) are disappearing and are being replaced with entirely new
ways of interacting, making a living and making a difference. Not just for organizations, but
for individualspeople like you. http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-system-set-persuade-ebook/dp/B... Driving or Security Anti-Drowsy Alert Alarm $1.70 shipped DEAL EXTREME

That respirator (MP) uses P100 cartridges, which means that they trap 99.97% of dusts and mists that are 0.3 microns or larger (roughly equivalent to 1/300 of the diameter of a human hair). Whereas this Paint and Pesticide (PP) deal only blocks 95% of the same sized particles. Additionally, the MP cartridges are approved against both a variety of acid gases and organic vapors, while the chemical portion of the PP cartridge is only approved against organic vapors. The trade off is that the MP cartridges clog up more quickly because they block more dust.The reason why I buy the PP respirator and cartridges is that it&apos;s effective enough for my purposes (I&apos;m not around acid gases), they require less frequent filter changes, and the filters are cheaper. Additionally, the PP filters use a prefilter, which help extend the main cartridge even more. Finally, 95% effectiveness is against the tiniest of particles, so anything bigger would have a higher chance of being caught anyway.I&apos;d also be curious to note if anyone has tried both and can speak more about the differences (lower airflow on the MP, etc).Amazon Coupons Is maxing out my student loans a good idea? (IBR Question) 
 Added on : Saturday February 25th 2012 12:14:20 AM If I have a sure non-profit job/government job lined up after school (in a very specialized field, have been guaranteed the job), are there any incentives for me not to max out my loans and live the high life? Currently, I am being very careful and living on the least possible. The firs grad degree was free (beyond living expenses), but the masters will probably cost me and so will the living expenses (waiting for scholarship info). IBR PSLF gets rid of the debt in 10 years with no tax consquences. Only 10 percent of DISCRETIONARY income. AGI based, so all my 401k contribution dont count. Seems like a good deal.If I get the scholarship or fellowship, I will be looking at around 40k for both degrees+BA. That wouldn&apos;t be worth IBRing. If I don&apos;t get anything, I will be looking at 70k. I could max this up to 100k+If I don&apos;t get any scholarships for the second part of the degree, should I just max out and enjoy the moral hazard?

Available at a small fraction of the price of a real tilt-shift lens, the new product offers a greater degree of creativity by providing many more tweaks, options and customization settings than even the highest-end tilt-shift lenses.

Tilt-shift photography is a unique style of photo art that makes a life-size object or location look like a miniature model. To achieve this, the camera is equipped with a special tilt-shift lens, allowing photographers to go beyond the limitations of DOF and perspective. Ideally, photos need to be taken from a great height, for example, a bridge, mountain or helicopter, which creates the illusion that the viewer looks at a miniature model.

Myself Credit score ~790 About 160K in avail credit card lines from churn and AORs, Owe 104K (at 4.75% on house worth about 130K and about 14K in student loan debt at 1.5% rate (will be paid off in about 7 more years), No other debt, just normal bills. Will earn about 65K this year.
Fiance: Just discovered last week credit score about 560, Owes 16K on a car loan at 8.99% for 72 m, 4 years remaining, Owes 37K in student loans for her grad degree (Some were not subsidized, and all will be out of deferment by July 2012 and acruing at 6.8%.) She only has about $500 in credit cards that will be paid off in about 2 weeks. She&apos;ll earn around 45K this year.I discovered the issue last week when she was declined for 2 cc apps I had her do for bonuses.
We pulled a report and her credit is not bad, she just has little of it. She basically has like 3 ccs worth about 2K total in lines, but the one she owes on was recently over 500 due to a late fee and its limit is $500 so thats a ding. Looks like she often pays that one a smidge over 30 days normally, but she pays so a slight ding.
She prob got 2 dings for the 2 apps I encouraged her to do.
I am MAD that she did a new car loan 2 years ago at 8.99% for 72m and that is just eating me up inside.
Her student loans should be cut in half soon as she should qualify for a big paydown due to the place shes worked for several years now meeting that requirement.
One thing on her student loans, is on her credit report, 2 of them report like she is &quot;over the limit&quot; because they have been unsubsidized and acruing interest for 2 years. So they report sort of like an over the limit card. She has already been paying on those for the last 6 months consstently.She really doesn&apos;t have bad credit, its just the little she has allows a couple small things to make a big ding.She&apos;ll be moving into my house in a bit over 2 months.I&apos;m not sure what to attack first. Apparently there is no big student loan consolidation program like I had to reduce the rate.
I&apos;d have her immediately refi the car to a 4 year penfed at 1.99% but based on her score she wont be approved.
She prob lost 30 pts on her score for the two apps I convinced her to do.I would even consider just putting the car in my name to &quot;refi&quot; or buy it, but I dunno how that works as far as insurance and taxes now being in my name, etc.
My current card is paid for as of 3 years ago, but I&apos;m considering buying a another car in the next 6 months and looking for less than 2% to 0% interest at that time.Not sure whether to say, once shes out of her apt lease, that we start throwing $1000 per month at her student loans first, or put an extra 100 towards the car to cut it from 4 years to 3.1 or refi the car to my name and still pay the same extra total and cut it to 2.9 years and save 2K in interest on it.If I took on the car, I&apos;m responsible and I know its my obligation to ensure its paid and I will do so.
I just love FWF and I like to squeeze every dime out I can and It eats me up that shes gotta deal with 8.99% on the car, and 6.8% on the student loans.Thoughts?

 Added on : Tuesday February 21st 2012 12:14:33 PM Stats:
Myself Credit score ~790 About 160K in avail credit card lines from churn and AORs, Owe 104K (at 4.75% on house worth about 130K and about 14K in student loan debt at 1.5% rate (will be paid off in about 7 more years), No other debt, just normal bills. Will earn about 65K this year.
Fiance: Just discovered last week credit score about 560, Owes 16K on a car loan at 8.99% for 72 m, 4 years remaining, Owes 37K in student loans for her grad degree (Some were not subsidized, and all will be out of deferment by July 2012 and acruing at 6.8%.) She only has about $500 in credit cards that will be paid off in about 2 weeks. She&apos;ll earn around 45K this year.I discovered the issue last week when she was declined for 2 cc apps I had her do for bonuses.
We pulled a report and her credit is not bad, she just has little of it. She basically has like 3 ccs worth about 2K total in lines, but the one she owes on was recently over 500 due to a late fee and its limit is $500 so thats a ding. Looks like she often pays that one a smidge over 30 days normally, but she pays so a slight ding.
She prob got 2 dings for the 2 apps I encouraged her to do.
I am MAD that she did a new car loan 2 years ago at 8.99% for 72m and that is just eating me up inside.
Her student loans should be cut in half soon as she should qualify for a big paydown due to the place shes worked for several years now meeting that requirement.

 Added on : Friday February 17th 2012 06:13:52 PM Long time lurker, first time poster here. I&apos;ve been struggling with some career-related decisions lately, and am hoping the minds of FWF can provide some unique insight.My background:- B.A. Economics
- In the accounting field
- Passed the CPA exam, but need more experience for the certificate
- Age 25, married, no kids
- Located in CaliforniaWhile I was in school, my plan was to follow the &quot;normal&quot; CPA career path (4-5 years at Big4/large regional CPA firm&gt;transition to corporate accounting/open my own small firm). Due to the recession, however, many firms were more or less freezing new hiring by the time I was nearing graduation and my job prospects were poor. I worked as a temp, was unemployed for a while, then was able to land my current job, which is with a municipal government in an accounting role. I decided at the time that it was a good opportunity to ride out the bad economy and get my CPA exams out of the way, which I finished a few months ago. As of now, I&apos;ve been with my current employer for almost two years. It&apos;s a good job overall, but I&apos;m having misgivings about my current path and trying to decide where to go from here.My biggest concern is that the economy is still shaky and I&apos;m hesitant to leave my current job, which is very secure, to pursue my original plan and look for less stable employment in a public accounting role. I don&apos;t believe my experience thus far would translate particularly well to public accounting, meaning there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;d take a salary cut as well and start in an entry-level role. On the other hand, it doesn&apos;t look like the job market will be improving much for at least the next couple of years and I&apos;m afraid of attracting stigma as a government employee by staying in the public sector too long. My job right now also tends to be pretty mind-numbing most of the time and not particularly satisfying on a personal level. Essentially, I&apos;m trying to decide between making a long-term commitment to my current employer and quitting to try to follow my original plan.Current job:- $60k salary, likely future earnings potential is $~80k in five years, $~110k in ten years (plus COLA). Small potential for $~150k in a CFO role within 10-20 years.
- Full health/dental/vision coverage paid by employer. 5-7 weeks PTO per year (paid holidays plus vacation). Ample sick days.
- Defined benefit pension plan (1% at 50, 2% at 60) and 457 plan.
- Relaxed atmosphere, 40 hour work weeks with almost zero overtime required.Alternative:- Based on recent research, $50-$55k likely starting salary, future earnings potential $70-$100k in five years, may be as low as $80k or as high as $200k+ in ten years.
- Health/dental/vision plans offered by most employers I&apos;ve researched, with varying degrees of employee share.
- 401(k) plan, possibly with employer match. No DB pension.
- LOTS of overtime during the busy season at a CPA firm, 40-45 hours/week during the rest of the year.
- Work is somewhat more fulfilling.What would you do in my shoes?tl;dr: Keep boring, safe government job or take probable pay cut and extra risk for potentially better job in the future? Cobra 12 Band Radar Detector w/ 360 Degree Detection LaserEye, SafetyAlert Transmitters $45 Shipped @ Amazon

 Added on : Wednesday February 08th 2012 06:21:50 PM This thread is on behalf of my significant other.Her background includes
1. An MA in English Literature.
2. &quot;Adjunct Professor&quot; in a college for 1 year. This is outside USA.
3. Stay-at-home mom looking after the kids for the past 6 years.WES (and education evaluation service) evaluated her GPA to be 2.996 in BA and 3.336 in MA.She loves teaching. So she decided that she&apos;d like to become an elementary teacher. The degree she would like to work towards is an MS in Elementary Education along with state certification. In our state - that is a 5 year program (yes - you read that right!!).Factors/Reasons for choosing &quot;Elementary Education&quot;:
1. She loves teaching.
2. If she can get a job in the same school where our kids go (or if kids can move there) - then it will become very convenient. Her vacations will always coincide with the kids.
3. Perceived lack of safety for teachers in some high schools - hence elementary teaching is preferred.
Sequence of events since figuring out what she wants to do:1. She took Praxis 1 in 2011 and scored 95th percentile or higher in all three sections. She also cleared TOEFL.2. She spoke with the academic adviser of the teaching college she&apos;d like to go to. The advisor said that subject to her being accepted in the school, they should be able to transfer all the credits (as equivalents) from her overseas English MA and knock down 2.5 years from the MS program. i.e. she should be able to complete her MS in around 2 years (instead of the regular 5) if she is up for it. He also asked her to complete 5 pre-requisite college courses before she applies for admission. These are a couple of math courses, a science course, a child psychology course and a US History course.3. She took the Accuplacer placement test in the nearby community college in order to qualify for the math courses since she did not do any college math before. She needed the level D (Pre-Calculus). She got this level and also scored pretty good (99th percentile in all the levels except for the &quot;college level algebra&quot;. She got 80th percentile there).4. The director of the department that offers these tests happens to be a Math prof and he also happened to be the one who signed the waiver allowing her to sit directly in the required math courses. Apparently he liked her placement test scores enough to offer her a &quot;job&quot; as a &quot;tutor&quot; in the community college for some of their elementary math courses. She is currently doing this job (mostly as a way to add this to her resume) a few hours every week (along with 10 credits and two kids). Apparently the director is so far happy with her work. He also thinks she is &quot;overqualified for an elementary teaching job&quot;, &quot;it was a waste for her to study English and should have taken Math instead&quot;, and that she should at least aim for a high school teaching job if not higher. He was also gracious enough to offer to give her a recommendation based on her job and personally speak with the folks in the teaching college when she applies there.6. The feedback from her classes (at the same community college) is also very positive so far. After two classes, her math class prof (different from the earlier one) was ready to write a note to the Math chair waiving further pre-requisites for her so that she could apply to the MS program this Summer instead of in the fall.After this long &quot;history&quot; - now it is my time to ask for suggestions and feedback. What other career options could she have opted for (or can still look at)? She wants something relatively low stress so that she can be with the kids more.Will she is considered overqualified for an elementary teaching job? How easy/difficult will it be for her to find a job (or change when she needs it) assuming she does well in the college? Bracketron Stand with Headrest Mount for iPad 2 for $11 + free shipping

 Added on : Friday February 03rd 2012 03:15:43 AM I thought I would try this topic to see how it goes over in FWF Finance. First, this isn&apos;t a political discussion about arbitration - it isn&apos;t the place for it so please lets not go there. This is about arbitration in the workplace for those of you that are either under some sort of collective bargaining agreement, considering a job that involves one, or just have questions about it. You might be asking the following:- Why post this in FWF finance?
Because for quite a few people (although a shrinking number of people overall, I know) arbitrators have tremendous power over your pay, can overturn your employers decision to discharge you (or sustain it), determine your benefits, etc. Its as much of a finance topic as any employment related thread it.- Why are you qualified to talk about it?
For the past 4 years I&apos;ve worked for an arbitrator part time that does public and private sector labor arbitration. Over the course of that time I have done everything but sit in the arbitrator&apos;s chair during the hearing. I have written around two dozen binding decisions(involving companies like Norfolk Southern, the Social Security Administration, various regional hospitals, etc.) - the position is sort of like a law clerk in that the judge sits on the bench but we all know the law clerks do much of the writing and generally know the inner-workings of the system.- And your legal credentials are?
Absolutely zero! I am not a lawyer, I make no claims to having anything but practical experience with this and about a semester&apos;s worth of law school classes that I took as electives in graduate school. Most of the arbitrators I&apos;ve met are not lawyers - most of them do have a few masters degrees or a PhD though - subject doesn&apos;t seem to matter though. The arbitrator I work for has a PhD in political science. Most clients actually seem to prefer a non-lawyer arbitrator.I should note this does not cover consumer arbitration (I&apos;ve never been a part to cases involving credit card arbitration or anything like that) - just workplace arbitration. We may not have enough people who care about this, in which I&apos;ll just let the thread die. Again, please, as a reminder: this is supposed to be a functional decision about arbitration and how it can effect your employment - how to handle it and that sort of thing. Please don&apos;t put your personal politics in here. New Career advice... 
 Added on : Thursday February 02nd 2012 12:10:31 PM So I graduated from College with my Business Administration Degree last May and have yet to find a new job. I currently have a decent paying job so it&apos;s not like I&apos;m unemployed but I&apos;m just finding it depressing that I can&apos;t break this cycle of not getting an interview anywhere. It seems like every job that is available in the Business/Finance/Management field require 10 years experience, a Masters Degree or pay $10k less a year than I currently earn...Anybody have any advice on how to land an entry level job in this field? I am in the NW Florida region if anyone is hiring ;. qvc.com $124 George Foreman Evolve Grill w/ 6 Removable Non-stickPlates

Cheap for only $3.99 Link Tax Suggestions for Next Year 
 Added on : Monday January 30th 2012 06:06:21 PM Me and my wife are both in high paying jobs and our combined gross is around 190K. We both have 401k plans at work. Last year we didn&apos;t contribute much to 401k as we are clearing all the debts we have. I contributed 4K just enough to get the employer match. My wife she contributed only 3K, but she gets 9% of her salary around 10-12K in company contribution. At the end of year, I have some money left and wanted to contribute to Roth IRA. But we are not eligible as married couple as the income limit is around 170K. My plan for next year is to maximize the 401k for both of us, which will bring the income down from 190K to 160K. I can contribute then around 10K to Roth IRA. Any other suggestions from the FW&apos;s? I will have another 10K left to invest in retirement. I already contribute around 15K combined to insurance plans and do not want to put more into it.Thanks in advance.PS: We graduated just three years ago with masters degrees, married and bought house 2 yrs back. We already have 80K combined in 401K. My wife is considering babysitting several kids in our home. What is the best way to reduce liability? 
 Added on : Sunday January 29th 2012 12:34:34 PM We currently have two children under the age of two, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom. She is going to school for a business degree, but online, and does most of the work in the evenings and during weekends while I&apos;m home.She&apos;s mentioned several times that she&apos;s considering advertising to babysit, to earn some extra money. This would let us get some credit card debt paid off much sooner, and pay down other debt, such as student loans.We live in ohio, and a quick google search turns this up -
http://jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/page2.stmLooks like as long as we only took in one additional kid under two, and no more than 4 all together, we wouldn&apos;t require any licensing or anything unless she wanted to take government money, for people that get assistance paying for childcare. I&apos;m not sure what the license requirements are, but I&apos;m sure it wouldn&apos;t be too difficult or something our home or my wife wouldn&apos;t pass.
I have suggested to her that we pay the $125 for her to get an LLC and get a business checking account, as a means to reduce liability.
Then, purchase an umbrella insurance policy, in case a kid breaks a leg and she gets sued. This would also let us do things like get business accounts with things like Costco or Sams club, and she could write off a lot of expenses, such as any mileage she puts on her car for the business.Are there any other suggestions on things to look into, or look out for? iPhone 4 Leather Swivel Holster for $10 at Amazon w/free shipping (65% off)

 Added on : Sunday January 22nd 2012 06:17:23 PM Let me preface this by saying I think undergraduate college is a huge bubble in this country, and I think students and parents are getting scammed for huge sums of money. Here is my personal story and why I am posting right now. I am going to be very specific about schools and costs.
My relative has a full ride to University of Connecticut, certainly a good school, but obviously not IVY. She is clearly very smart, full rides are rare. My feeling is that anyone who graduates from a school like UConn, and distinguishes themselves with good grades and impressive activates, can compete with anyone for any job coming from a very good private school. Now here is the rub.My relative decided to go to Boston University, a good private but very expensive school. In my mind, networking opportunities aside, I dont see BU as that different of a school than UConn. The difference is cost, however, is roughly $130,000. To make matters worse she is studying to become a teacher.
I think her parents gave her very bad advice, and I am sure this same scenario is being played out all over the country. She is not getting value for her $130,000. Moreover, this debt will saddle her for a good part of her entire life. She is paying for the experience of Boston, and she is too young to realize how high a price she is paying. At $60,000 a year, I think a fair estimate of what she can expect to average over a 10 year teaching span, that debt and interest can easily represent 40% of her entire take home pay. College costs are crazy, and way too many people are going to college. I think the old liberal arts degree is going to be a thing of the past. I went to the University of Michigan, obviously a great school, but again not IVY. If I wanted to send my kids there from out of state it would cost me over $200,000! They can literally go FCK themselves! God help you if you are middle to upper middle class and want to send your kids to school, be prepared for them to want all your lives savings.
On a side note, since Obama has taken office the amount of school debt, a debt that can never be discharged and will follow you to the grave, had doubled! We are saddling our kids with debt at their most vulnerable point in life. Be prepared to live with your grown up kids well into their 30s if not longer.

 Added on : Monday January 16th 2012 12:30:08 PM I found this article to be quite informative:California Prison Academy: Better Than a Harvard DegreeWSJ article said: The job might not sound glamorous, but a brochure from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations boasts that it &quot;has been called &apos;the greatest entry-level job in California&apos;and for good reason. Our officers earn a great salary, and a retirement package you just can&apos;t find in private industry. We even pay you to attend our academy.&quot; That&apos;s rightinstead of paying more than $200,000 to attend Harvard, you could earn $3,050 a month at cadet academy.

It gets better.

Training only takes four months, and upon graduating you can look forward to a job with great health, dental and vision benefits and a starting base salary between $45,288 and $65,364. By comparison, Harvard grads can expect to earn $49,897 fresh out of college and $124,759 after 20 years.

 Added on : Wednesday January 11th 2012 06:12:14 PM Some may wonder why I&apos;m asking a career type question on a finance forum. Its because I believe that many of the people on this forum are highly intelligent, and would be some of the best around at providing great input. Also it is finance related, due to the cost of college, the salary benefit, etc.Is there any way for a person who possesses very good technical skills, very scientific minded, and with a passion for the science/technology/engineering field to get their foot in the door in the industry, with a good paying job and possibility for advancement, based on self knowledge rather than a college degree? I have always been a very technical minded person, and really just have a passion for it. Getting into a job helping engineer new technology, or studying aerodynamics in a wind tunnel, or other similar things is something I think I could really excel in. I actually find myself studying all sorts of various things in the science/technology/engineering/computer field a couple hours every day, just because that&apos;s what I&apos;m interested in. I&apos;d be confident to say I probably have the equivalent level of education and technical ability as many people who do have bachelors or 4 year degrees in these general fields. The problem is I can never seem to get my foot in the door without that piece of paper. I do have a new plan of action, which is outside of the box. I haven&apos;t had much of a chance to try it yet, but so far it seems promising. Perhaps you guys who may be in the field can tell me what you think, and if you have any advice towards my plan.My plan is to do away completely with the typical resume. Resumes are so boring. And in my case with no degree, and my current trade being construction, a resume is almost worthless. Instead I&apos;m thinking of trying to get more of a portfolio to employers. One with pictures and descriptions of things I do to catch their eye and provide proof that I do have good technical ability. I want it to basically give the idea of &quot;look, I don&apos;t have a official degree, but I have the equivalent level of knowledge, and I&apos;m smart enough to learn anything you throw at me&quot;. Plus, just because someone has a college degree, doesn&apos;t mean they are smart or know much, they may have just smoked pot, partied, cheated on tests, and just squeaked by only to forget most of what they&apos;ve learned. With a portfolio, it demonstrates proof of competency and ability.Here are some examples of a couple portfolio pages I made slightly related to a recent position. These are by no means the top of my ability since most of these projects were thrown together in only a few hours. I&apos;m plenty capable of bigger, more complex projects. They are simply things I did for fun.Remote control self stabalizing tricopter

What do you guys think? Think its a good approach? Any ways to expand this idea, or do some other outside the box idea to break into the industry in a good paying career without the official degree? In general most people I know or run into always assume that I am an engineer, they think I&apos;m joking when I say I&apos;m a construction worker. I&apos;ve also been told that I&apos;m &quot;one conversation away from a great career, if I just get a chance to network with the right person&quot;. I may likely continue education sometime, but at this moment in time getting a degree is out of the question. Craftsman 18780 Evolv 12 amp Corded 7-in Circular Saw $29.74@sears.com

Perfect for photographers ready to make the move to digital SLR photography, the EOS Rebel T3 delivers beautiful photos and video, speed, simplicity and fun.

Technology for outstanding images
Canon&apos;s CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same technologies to maximize each pixel&apos;s light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It&apos;s an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there&apos;s an effective 1.6x increase in the lens&apos;s marked focal length when attached.
DIGIC 4 image processor
The improved DIGIC 4 Image Processor ensures that images are captured, processed and saved with remarkable speed. The EOS Rebel T3 DSLR&apos;s 3:2 multiple aspect ratio, in-camera RAW image processing, creative filters, image resizing and provided S2 and S3 image-recording quality are all possible thanks to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. With dazzling results, the DIGIC 4 Image Processor also works to capture and process data of images shot at 12.2 Megapixels at 3.0 fps, as well as 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, enhanced Face Detection Live mode, Full HD video recording, Auto Lighting Optimizer and Lens Peripheral Optimization.Specifications&amp;Dimensions General: Auto Focus:TTL phase detection Auto Focus Points (Zones) Qty:9 Digital Video Format:H.264, MOV Effective Sensor Resolution:12,200,000 pixels Enclosure Color:Black Field of View Crop Factor:1.6 Image Processor:DIGIC 4 Image Recording Format:JPEG, RAW, RAW + JPEG Image Stabilizer:Optical Max Video Resolution:1280 x 720 Optical Sensor Size:14.7 x 22mm Optical Sensor Type:CMOS Product Type:Digital camera - SLR with Live View mode, movie recording Sensor Resolution:12.2 Megapixel Total Pixels:12,600,000 pixels Exposure&amp;White Balance: Exposure Metering:Evaluative, partial (10%), center-weighted Exposure Metering Zones:63 Exposure Modes:Program, depth-of-field, bulb, automatic, manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority Exposure Range:EV 0-20 ( ISO 100 ) Light Sensitivity:ISO 100-6400, ISO auto (100-6400) Max Shutter Speed:1/4000 sec Min Shutter Speed:30 sec Special Effects:Neutral, Faithful, Monochrome, Landscape, Portrait White Balance:Custom, automatic, presets White Balance Bracketing:Yes White Balance Presets:Fluorescent, cloudy, tungsten light, flash, daylight, shade X-sync Speed:1/200 sec Dimensions: Depth (in.):3-1/10 in. Product Overview: Color:Black Features:Burst capability LCD Screen Size:2.7 to 2.9 in. Megapixels:12 to 13.9 megapixels Weight:16 to 19.9 oz. Lens System: Features:Aspherical lens Filter Size:58 mm Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera:29 - 88mm Focus Adjustment:Automatic, manual Lens Construction:9 groups / 11 elements Lens System Mounting:Canon EF Max View Angle:74.3 degrees Min Focus Range:9.8 in Type:3 x zoom lens - 18 - 55 mm - f/3.5-5.6 II Canon EF-S Zoom Adjustment:Manual Microphone: Microphone Operation Mode:Mono Camera Flash: Camera Flash:Pop-up flash Features:AF illuminator, flash +/- compensation Flash Modes:Fill-in mode, rear curtain sync, auto mode, flash OFF mode, red-eye reduction Guide Number (m / ISO 100):9.2 Additional Features: Additional Features:Direct print, USB 2.0 compatibility, RGB primary color filter, auto power save, digital noise reduction, DPOF support, display brightness control, depth-of-field preview button, PictBridge support, histogram display, AE lock, AF lock, FE lock, 720p HD Continuous Shooting Speed:2 frames per second, 3 frames per second, 0.8 frames per second Flash Terminal:Hot shoe Self Timer Delay:10 sec, 2 sec Viewfinder: Dioptric Correction Range:-2.5 to +0.5 Field Coverage:95% Magnification:0.8x Viewfinder Frames:Autofocus frame Viewfinder Information:Shutter speed, exposure compensation, AE lock, AF-in-focus, flash charge completion, red-eye reduction , aperture, white balance, high-speed sync indicator, flash compensation on/off, highlight tone priority, ISO sensitivity, memory card status Viewfinder Type:Optical - eye-level mirror pentaprism Display: Display Features:Built-in Resolution:230,000 pixels Type:2.7&quot; LCD display Connections: Connector Type:1 x Hi-Speed USB

 Added on : Saturday January 07th 2012 12:07:32 PM I am very confused how anyone be even reasonably confident of getting a good career through college? It just seems like such a huge gamble with the odds against you.I know so many people that are worse off going to college, than if they didn&apos;t. Because after getting out, they only end up in jobs making like $15-$18 an hour, and have $40k+ in debt with accruing interest. I don&apos;t really know any people personally who have got their degree and went on doing something they like, and making $60K-$120K a year, like the popular belief is supposed to be.I look through the course brocures at community colleges, and 90% of the so called courses they will teach, are in fields that do not likely pay well, like baker, child care, mechanic, etc. Sure, maybe major universities are better, but unless you are lucky as a child and your parents run a good college fund, the average person can&apos;t just put everything in life aside to go to a university mid point in their life.Also, many fields that seem to require degrees have such widely ranging payranges, that how are you supposed to have a clue what to expect? I&apos;ve &quot;heard of&quot; I.T. guys, network programmers, etc making 6 figure incomes, but ones I&apos;ve met make dirt. There are a lot of fields like that where you don&apos;t know if the pay will be $10 an hour or $40, since its so widely ranging.Most colleges to me seem more concerned about taking your money, since they are a business, than actually getting you into a good career.I&apos;ve worked quite a few jobs without college, and generally would make more than anyone I knew with a 2-4 year degree. Generally jobs could range from $20-$35 an hour. Currently at about $35, however I don&apos;t really like the career, and its also being hit hard by the economy, not getting full hours. I&apos;d be willing to take night classes, get a degree, etc if I was reasonably assured that I would be successful in getting a career that pays at least $30-$40 an hour, but it just seems to me like the odds of that are slim, and the more likely outcome would be racking up massive student loans, finding out that whatever claimed lucrative field I studied, only has low paying jobs available.How does anyone win this gamble? Trying to become more FWF-like 
 Added on : Saturday January 07th 2012 12:16:02 AM Let me start off by saying that I&apos;ve been reading for about 2-3 weeks, and this forum has some very brilliant people when it comes to finances. I look forward to becoming more financially smart and sound with time.With that in mind... I suppose I should get to the point. My wife and I (both 23, young and stupid) have not been good with our money (at all).
I am trying to use FWF tactics to slowly but surely dig us out of the hole we are in.

Text Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread - 2011 Edition 
 Added on : Thursday December 29th 2011 12:10:59 PM Greetings and Happy Holidays to All! It&apos;s time to get the 2011 Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread rolling. I started doing these threads annually on the FW Finance board in 2006. When I originally started this thread five years ago, I thought it could serve as a great resource for people to learn about the ups and downs of various careers, including information such as salaries and benefits. I have always found these threads particularly informative and interesting.Last year&apos;s thread seemed to have a lot of good information, even though it only stayed active for a couple of months. Hopefully this year&apos;s thread can remain active for longer. Now gang, here&apos;s a reminder of the rules, which 99.9% of you have been great at following over the past four years:If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2011? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:
Gender: MaleAge: 39Location: Northern NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2011 Compensation: $90,000 (Base Pay + a little extra money taking on extra duties.) Base salary for the 2011-2012 school year is about $88,000 right now, but should be more, since we do not have a current contract right now. (More on that in a minute.) My compensation this year is pretty much the same as it was last year, although last year&apos;s figure was inflated a bit due to a pretty large amount of retro pay due to me.Future Salary Projection: When our contract is settled (very soon hopefully), my base pay should be in the 100K range. This is the top of the teachers&apos; guide in our district, so future raises are going to be smaller after this, maybe 2K to 3K per year more for the foreseeable future. Benefits: Full medical, although teachers in NJ now have to pay a percentage of their salaries for their medical benefits. (It&apos;s currently 1.5% of base salary, but it&apos;s going up even more in the new year.) We get modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (at least if the state doesn&apos;t default on the benefits), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) In almost all districts in NJ, you can accumulate sick time from year to year. What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult and getting more difficult by the year. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching. Massive budget cuts have made the job even more difficult. Many teachers (myself included) are now finding themselves doing two jobs for the price of one due to massive retirements and staffing cuts.Would you recommend the career to others?Every year, it&apos;s become harder and harder for me to recommend teaching as a career. Public employees all over the U.S. have taken a real bashing over the past couple of years, and teachers seem to be Public Enemy #1 of the group. This is not an easy job. If you&apos;re doing it correctly, it&apos;s at least a 50-60 hour a week job, and it&apos;s 50-60 hours of grueling work. Teachers in urban districts in particular have taken a real beating. They are expected to be miracle workers, solving all of our society&apos;s ills. On top of that, there seems to be a growing chorus of people calling for teacher salaries and benefits to be cut to the bone. And, unfortunately for new teachers, your benefits are going to vanish before the benefits for the veteran teachers will. Once the teacher bashing subsides, I may be able to recommend teaching again as a profession. But for right now, it might be better to see what else is out there.

 Added on : Thursday December 29th 2011 09:40:29 AM Text Our cash-only experiment 
 Added on : Tuesday December 27th 2011 03:28:32 PM My family went way over budget for the first time ever this year, spending about 75% more than budgeted for non-fixed expenditures. I can&apos;t pinpoint the exact cause, it was likely some combination of my wife stress-spending (her final two semesters of school were particularly difficult), rewards-driven excursions (Groupon, Envaulted, etc.), and too much time spent lurking in the Hot Deals forums. I saw the problem growing, but my attempts to curb the spending just caused more stress and frustration for my family and I backed off figuring I would be better able to address the situation when things settled down after my wife&apos;s graduation (this seems to be the case).The overspending was alarming to me because I&apos;m very proud of my family&apos;s propensity to save (that is not to say that we&apos;re misers, our budget has always been reasonable and allowed us to easily meet our needs as well as afford the &quot;luxuries&quot; we enjoy). While I panic a bit every time I log in to Mint and see that large red bar, taking a step back reveals that we&apos;re still in reasonable shape financially (still debt-free except for the mortgage), though we have not been able to contribute nearly as much as planned to our emergency fund and IRAs.I believe that this period of overspending was short-lived and that we&apos;ll be able to stick to our budget as usual in 2012. We&apos;ll also have fewer expenses and (hopefully) more income now that my wife has her degree (in nursing, which pays well but is highly competitive in our area).Nonetheless, my wife and I had a discussion about it last week and we decided to try going cash-only for a couple of months to see how it will impact our spending habits. As money-conscious as we are, we still think that using cash will help us focus better on the value of purchases. While I&apos;m disappointed to be giving up the credit card Cash Back, I think we&apos;ll actually save more money and avoid cluttering up our house with unnecessary purchases. My goal is to make up a token amount of this year&apos;s overspending and get a hands-on understanding on how payment method affects how we think about our purchases.Our cash experiment starts January 1 (convenient, since our current AARP credit card bonus ends on December 31). I can go into the mechanics of our plan if anyone is interested, but it&apos;s a simple envelope system. We&apos;ll still use the credit cards on occasion (for gas and online purchases, for example), but we&apos;ll move the cash to next month&apos;s envelope.I feel almost like I&apos;m taking a step backwards, but I think it&apos;ll be a good experience regardless of the outcome. $59.99, Craftsman High Back Hydraulic Seat at Sears $40 Off

I could not resist - and bought one! Enjoy! Credit card companies engaging in &quot;snowballing&quot; adverse actions due to medical debt 
 Added on : Sunday December 25th 2011 12:20:42 AM Two things before I begin: (1) The reason why I am posting this on FWF and not creditboards or some other debt site is because the person involved genuinely feels a responsibility to pay for her bills and does not want to go the deadbeat route. (2) This isn&apos;t me, but I&apos;m posting for someone else hoping this will get more helpful responses than a random new member...but if it makes you feel better thinking its me, go for it. A close friend of mine in the PhD program I attend has gone ~$55,000 in credit card debt caused by medical bills. She didn&apos;t have insurance at the time, and also didn&apos;t negotiate (it appears to be to late to do that now). The balances are all on 0% or low promotional rates. She wants to pay the debt down eventually and does not want to default because she legitimately owes the money. However, the credit card companies are making this difficult because when the balances starting rising they all started cutting down credit lines and closing credit cards, which keeps increasing her debt to available credit ratio and causing further adverse action. She has not been late on any payment and has no other debt except student loans. She is now worried that when the promotional balances expire (~10 months) that all of these chain adverse actions and lowering of credit will have harmed her score enough that she won&apos;t be able to get new promotions to keep the APR low, at which point she would not be able to reasonably keep the payments up until she graduates (3 years) and can start paying it down more actively. If the debt goes to the normal interest rates, she won&apos;t be able to make the monthly payments.This friend has come to me asking for advice and I am unsure of what to tell her. The only option I see is telling her to take out maximum student loans and use those to service the debt, but that would be turning unsecured credit into student loan balances, which even if she intends on paying it off seems like a bad idea for a variety of reasons. Her current student loan debt is approximately ~40k from undergraduate + masters degree, but her PhD is paid for by the graduate school.

 Added on : Sunday December 18th 2011 06:15:00 PM I have decided to leave my current position due to various reasons, and I have two options:
1) Stay with current employer and relocate to a mid-sized city with under-developed and ghetto feel but slightly lower cost of living.
2) Accept offer with new employer and stay at current location, which is a nice sized metro with better schools and plenty of ammenities for the family.Salary compensation is about the same for both; however, my current company offers 8 more days of vacation per year. The new employer does offer better/cheaper health benefits and OT pay. It is also a global company with international presence; therefore, I could transfer within the company after a few years and move closer to the ocean. If I choose to relocate with the current employer, all costs associated with moving, including closing costs for the sale of my house, will be covered. Our current financial situation is as follows:
Combined HHI: ~$185K (SO is employed at the ghetto city already but uncertain of job security)
~$100K in liquid asset + 401k + pension
No debt except mortgage: owe $340k on $475k house. If I take the new job and not relocate:
1. SO will quit his job and return home to attend grad school.
2. HHI will drop to $120K - $130K.
3. Refinance existing home with lower interest rates
4. Buy our first rental property using part of the liquid asset. SO should have time to fix/manage it.If I stay with the same company and relocate:
1. Buy a smaller house for $200k while we wait to sell our current home
2. Kids will likely be in private school as public schools are mediocre, and that will incur additional costs.
3. Once the house is sold, we will purchase a nicer home for $350K - $400K and rent out #1
4. We will continue to save while SO is employed. If SO looses his job, he will likely stay unemployed for awhile due to poor job market in his field. Thus, he will likely go for a Master&apos;s degree, dropping our HHI to $120K - $130K.Any feedback will be greatly appreciated! TCL L40FHDF12TA 40-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV $319.99 @Amazon

 Added on : Friday December 09th 2011 03:06:24 PM maybe this is a dumb thing to post but I wanted some other opinions on the subject. Here is a little background

I am currently a High school math teacher, I also bartend (was managing the bar until I started teaching 4 years ago) a few nights a week to subsidize my income and put away money to invest in real estate. I have one student rental duplex that I bought after selling 2 rental properties. It does well. I am looking for something more challenging than teaching. The public school system is broken. I do not think it will be fixed in the near future. I love working with the kids and will continue to do a big brother type mentoring. I need something more interesting and challenging though. I have worked on rehabbing houses doing much of the work and subbing out what I needed to time wise. I would love to get into running my own property management company and building up my own protfolio of rentals. So I am asking those in the business world what are some things a person with my skill set would be able to get into. I am extremely outgoing, have worked with challenged kids, have a strong analytical mind.
Any math degrees out there and what are you guys doing with it? I know this is a very personal choice but I wanted to see what some of the fine intelligent FWF members thought on the subject.

Clean, efficient heat is yours in one convenient and portable unit. The Induction Cooker by Tatung doesnt use traditional heat transfer to prepare your food. Instead, it uses an electromagnetic field to generate the heat within the pan or pot you place on the cooktop.With induction cooking, your cookware heats up fast, reducing your cooking time dramatically. Best of all, the Induction Cooker is energy efficient, because your energy bill and the environment are important to Tatung. For high heat dishes, the Induction Cooker can heat up to 430-degrees. It also features a two-hour timer setting and cookware suitability detection to reduce the guesswork in your food preparation. Experience fast, effective cooking in one elegant solution with the Tatung Induction Cooker today!Space-saving Design The Tatung TICT-1500W induction cooktop crams 1500-watt cooking power into a space-saving design, so you can boil, saut, stew, steam, simmer or fry at any convenient location in your house.
Induction Cooking Technology The Tatung TICT-1500W induction cooktop uses a magnetic coil to heat the cooking pot itself, resulting in a cooler, safer cooking surface and added energy efficiency.
Cookware Suitability Detection When a suitable cookware is placed on the Tatung TICT-1500W, the magnetic coil will react to generate heat for cooking. Heat will be shut off automatically when the cookware is removed, even if you don&apos;t turn them off.
Ceramic Surface The ultra-smooth ceramic cooking surface has no seams or gaps to trap food or spills, so clean-up is a breeze.
Convenient Timer The two-hour timer allows you to accurately set and monitor cooking time for perfectly cooked food.
Cooking Pot Included A stainless cooking pot with a glass lid is included with purchase, perfect for making stir fry or stews. It&apos;s Back! Makita 12-Volt Max 4-Piece Combo Kit 149.00 FS

VESA standard compliant Do I close a credit card? 
 Added on : Tuesday November 22nd 2011 06:11:27 PM Short story:I&apos;m 22 years old and finishing my college degree. I work part time and make around $10,000/year. I have about $16,000 in cash / stocks savedI have 6 credit cards. I have paid every one off completely each month, never carried a balance and have only one late payment (by 2 days... oops!) in my life. I use them for rewards.These are the credit cards I have:Chase Freedom Mastercard ($1500) Opened the month I turned 18, so 4 years old. Haven&apos;t used since I got the Visa Freedom.
Chase Freedom Visa ($4000) Mistake on the bank&apos;s part, I initially wanted a credit increase, but they gave me a new card. I use this as my primary
Amazon Visa ($3100) - Use for 3% back on Amazon
Kohls card ($500) - who doesn&apos;t like 30% off
Sony Visa ($7500) - Used to get a free PS3 with $200 cash. Haven&apos;t used since.
Bank of America Visa ($5000) - Just signed up to get 3% Cash Back on gas and 2% on groceries. I&apos;m thinking of closing a card to reduce the amount of CL I have and to have less cards open. Which would you close? $775 Diamondback Podium 3 Road Bike, Shimano 105, BB30

 Added on : Sunday November 20th 2011 03:15:25 AM I am in the process of getting a divorce after being married 20 years. We have been separated for 2 years. I ended up with a bankruptcy in the process. Long story how I did and he didn&apos;t. Short version is we married very young me-17 him 20 and most of the credit cards were in my name. He left 2 years ago and just stopped paying the bills (at least the ones that didn&apos;t have his name on them). It was chapter 7 and was discharged in August of 2011. I am still living in the house and under the provisions of the divorce will have the option of staying here but I will have to get a mortgage in my name. First I will say there is no equity in the house. About even at mortgage/market value. How long after my discharge will a lender even consider a mortgage for me. Also will they include my spousal support and child support?I will be getting $2200 spousal support. (This is permanent unless I remarry or he dies)
I will be getting $800 in child support until June 2016
I make about $1800 a month at my job. (I know it&apos;s not a lot but I had not worked in a very long time (stay at home mom) and had to take what I could when he left. I have an associates degree but that doesn&apos;t help much these days)So my total income will be approx $4800 a month.I have no bills or credit cards.I will have up to 7 years to refinance (this is still being negotiated with the lawyers) but I would like to do it as soon as I am able. So I am working with the ballpark on the mortgage to refinance at $250K.Any thoughts?

 Added on : Friday November 18th 2011 03:04:02 PM Some interesting numbers on this article. Did you know that... 50. From 1948 until 2007, the average duration of unemployment was 13.5 weeks. Today, it&apos;s 40.5 weeks.49. In 1982, a 30-year mortgage carried an interest rate of 17.6%. Today, it&apos;s 4.1%. On a $250,000 loan, that&apos;s the difference between a monthly payment of $3,686 versus $1,210.48. In 2000, 69% of businesses offered workers health insurance. By 2009, just 60% did, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.47. In 1952, corporate taxes were 6.1% of GDP, and employment taxes were 1.8% of GDP. In 2009, corporate taxes were 1% of GDP, and employment taxes were 6.3% of GDP.46. The day after Standard&amp;Poor&apos;s downgraded U.S. Treasuries was the second best day for Treasuries in modern history.45. &quot;Just 1 in 7 U.S. workers is of normal weight without a chronic health problem,&quot; according to The Wall Street Journal, citing Gallup data.44. Adjusted for inflation, nationwide home prices have dropped 8.5% since 1979. Unrelated: 60% of homeowners say a major reason they bought a home is because they think it will make a good retirement investment.43. The markup AT&amp;T;(NYSE: T ) charges for a single text message ($0.20) compared with a standard mobile data package ($25 for 2 gigs) is roughly 10 million percent.42. Tax evasion has added an estimated $3 trillion to the national debt over the past decade, according to David Callahan of Demos, citing Internal Revenue Service data.41. According to The Wall Street Journal, &quot;every year 17,000 American-trained masters and doctoral students leave the U.S. to find work elsewhere.&quot;40. Over the past 25 years, college tuition has increased at nearly four times the rate of broader inflation.39. Health care for an average family now runs $19,393 a year, according to the Milliman Medical Index. It was about half that much in 2002.38. Power to the people! According to The Los Angeles Times: &quot;Some 75% of respondents said they were following the [California] budget debate, yet only 16% were aware that state spending has shrunk by billions of dollars over the last three years.&quot;37. California will spend $5.7 billion on its main public universities this year, and $9.6 billion on prisons, according to The Bay Citizen.36. The labor force participation rate for men has dropped from 87% in 1948 to 71% today. 35. The personal savings rate in August was 4.5%. Since 1959, it has averaged 7%. Returning to that level would divert more than $200 billion a year from consumer spending into saving.34. 5.5 million Americans are unemployed and not receiving unemployment benefits. Last year, that number was 1.4 million.33. The U.S. government provides health care for a minority of its population (elderly and poor) at a greater cost per citizen than many European countries spend on universal coverage.32. As a percentage of GDP, federal taxes in 2010 were the lowest since 1950.31. Between 2007 and 2009, those with a bachelor&apos;s degree saw the employment-to-population ratio fall by just 0.5%. For those without a bachelor&apos;s degree, it fell by more than 2%.30. Household debt payments as a percentage of income are now at the lowest level since 1994.29. Despite record federal deficits, total debt throughout the economy -- public plus private -- as a percentage of GDP has been dropping since 2008. Households are shedding debt faster than the government can go into it.28. Just not student debt: Total student loans outstanding are expected to reach $1 trillion this year. The average student now leaves college with nearly $23,000 of debt. As Time pointed out, &quot;Students today are borrowing double the amount they did ten years ago -- after adjusting for inflation.27. Total state and local pension shortfalls now equal $4.4 trillion, according to State Budget Solutions.26. In 2000, interest payments on the national debt totaled $222 billion. By 2009, the debt had more than doubled, but interest payments were $186 billion. Lower interest rates have saved taxpayers trillions of dollars.25. According to The New York Times, only 23% of Americans benefit from the mortgage interest tax deduction, yet 93% support it.24. For every $1,000 decline in home values, Americans reduce spending by $20 to $70 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.23. Without mortgage equity withdrawal -- people using their homes as ATMs -- the U.S. economy would have been in recession for most of the 2001-2006 period.22. The percentage of Americans covered by health insurance fell from 86.9% in 2000 to 83.7% in 2010. It has declined in eight of the past 10 years.21. Nationwide real estate values have declined by about $7 trillion since 2006.20. CEOs of S&amp;P;500 companies are entitled to receive an average of $22 million upon being fired, according to GMI. &quot;In total, it would cost shareholders $10.8 billion to fire the CEOs of all of the companies in the S&amp;P;500,&quot; it writes.19. One percent of households captured 52% of all income gains from 1993-2008.18. Just 400 people earned 10% of all capital gains in 2007. Between 2000 and 2007, the top 400 taxpayers captured about 2% of all economic growth.17. People spend their money on different sets of goods and services. The richest 10% of Americans had an inflation rate that was about 6% higher than the bottom 10% between 1994 and 2005.16. According to former White House budget advisor Peter Orszag: &quot;In 1990, about 63 percent of business income in the U.S. took the form of wages and other types of labor compensation. ... By 2005, that figure had dropped to 61 percent. And by the middle of this year, it had fallen to 58 percent. ... The difference from 1990 to today -- about 5 percentage points or so of private-sector income -- amounts to more than $500 billion a year.&quot;15. Private jobs growth over the past two years has been faster than it was from 2001-2003. Public job losses have been a major factor in our current jobs crisis.14. If federal, state, and local governments hadn&apos;t been slashing jobs since 2009, today&apos;s unemployment rate would be nearly a full percentage point lower.13. The White House -- famously optimistic throughout all administrations -- forecasts that the unemployment rate won&apos;t return to pre-recession levels until 2016.12. According to the National Review, &quot;[General Motors (NYSE: GM ) ] has 96,000 employees but provides health benefits to a million people.&quot;11. While gold hit record highs this summer, the yield on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, implied a forecast of near record low inflation.10. According to author Matt Ridley, it took an average person 4,700 hours of work to afford a Ford (NYSE: F ) Model T in 1908. Today, it takes an average person 1,000 hours of work to afford an ordinary car.9. Adjusted for inflation, the first Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL ) Macintosh cost $5,440. Today&apos;s iPad costs $500, and is outrageously more advanced.8. About half of all Tweets are derived from 20,000 people -- or just 0.05% of Twitter members.7. UBS estimates that illegal lending in China amounts to $630 billion a year, or about 10% of the country&apos;s gross domestic product.6. Only 2.7% of what Americans spend their money on are goods and services from China. 88.5% is on American-made goods and services.5. Cash flow among S&amp;P;500 companies set a new all-time record last year, at $1.2 trillion.4. Between dividends and buybacks, S&amp;P;500 companies returned $4.3 trillion to shareholders from 2003 to 2010.3. According to the Hedge Fund Research index, hedge funds as a group returned 19.6% between March 2009 and May 2011. Broad stock market indexes in the developed world returned 114% during that period.2. Food prices invariably come up when people talk about inflation. But average disposable income has risen twice as fast as food prices over the past 50 years. There&apos;s been fairly steady food deflation over time.1. America is still by far the largest economy in the world, nearly three times the size of China&apos;s or Japan&apos;s economy, and nearly five times the size of Germany&apos;s. We have the best schools, the deepest financial system, the most advanced innovation, and the brightest entrepreneurs.50 Amazing Numbers About the Economy HAAN FS20 Classic Steam Mop with 15 Steam Jets, Telescoping Handle&amp;2 Ultra-Microfiber Cleaning Pads $54.98 shipped

 Added on : Friday November 11th 2011 06:09:04 PM A family friend is considering going to an ACICS (Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools) institution. At first I was very concerned about the decision, however she is 25, does not have a high school diploma/GED, and is not having luck finding work as is. The program in question is 1-2yrs, costs ~$10k/yr, and she ends up a with a certificate as a medical assistant in the end. Based on local newspaper job searches I have done, starting pay is between $10-$20/hr, which is significantly more than she has ever made in the past. She was told that she can then go on to get a nursing degree at that (or another) institution.I know the general consensus is to avoid these independently accredited, for-profit institutions, but are there cases where they can be a good option? Has anyone known someone for whom this has worked out for them?Thanks in advance. Creative Live Optia 1.3 MP Webcam With 270 Degree Swivel Range, SKYPE READY $10 ship REFURB

 Added on : Sunday November 06th 2011 03:00:26 AM Hi there, the advice isn&apos;t for me, its for my fiance. A bit of perspective, I&apos;ve finished med school, now looking to clear my usmle and get a decent surgical residency. I have no debt thankfully. As for my fiance, she has a BA hons in dance and arts and cultural management and is/was a dancer. Due to an unfortunate injury, she won&apos;t be able to put so much stress on her knee anymore, thereby eliminating dance as a career. Now she&apos;s interested in event management so she can still be around dance/performing arts so she&apos;s looking @ going back to school to get either a bachelors in event management or perhaps a certificate course. Thankfully, money isn&apos;t exactly a problem for her either. Now, I was curious if anyone here had any advice as to which course/degree would be cost-effective (no point doing a certificate course if no one recognizes it). Any advice would be helpful. Thanks again!P.S. - sorry if the above rambles on or has typos, am typing this on my phone with limited time. Thanks again! Degree Deodorant&amp;Magic the Gathering for $1.00

They are made by MTD and similar MTD model is for sale at local Costco store with everyday price $599.99. So it&apos;s not really attractive for this model, but is the lowest price I&apos;ve seen on a craftsman 2 stage.Both models have excellent reviews and Sears has 5 years in home service plan for extra $. I usually don&apos;t buy extended warranty, but Snow Blower is so hard to get back to store and it&apos;s cold when breaks. So a close call. Walgreens 10/16-10/22 W Pads FREE A/RR

Revlon b1g Seeking advice on career: boring high paying job v/s doing what one enjoys? 
 Added on : Friday October 14th 2011 03:00:24 PM I&apos;m a 32 year old engineer with an advanced degree working in Silicon Valley tech. I have a high paying job ($160-180k) that I don&apos;t like. I&apos;m a people person and a car nut. I would rather sell cars. I tried to do this part time for a few months (moonlighting) but the money is simply not there. I probably made $5000 is three months, much lesser after expenses. I know if I quit my job tomorrow and start in the car business, it will take me at least 7-10 years to get to my current income. What should I do? My current employer will not allow me to move to sales. They have hired me for my technical expertise. How can I enjoy what I&apos;m doing, and also make decent coin? Any ideas?

 Tips for New Grads looking to Enter Workforce 
 Added on : Friday September 30th 2011 06:00:05 AM Do the older, seasoned FWFers have any tips and advice for those fresh out of college or grad school looking to make an honest living?There are two important things that need to be done by a person in that situation:1. Finding a good job (decent pay, good work-life balance, reduced likelihood of burnout)2. Keeping that good job (not being layed off, fired, being replaced by technology, losing govt job due to budget cuts)
A lot of employers are simply not hiring much, and a lot who are hiring seem to be offering a lot of temp and contractor jobs
instead of full time jobs with benefits. Any advice on getting a full time job with benefits or are young people supposed to make
do with what&apos;s offered and wait a few years to get a better job? (this is for people with either a college or master&apos;s degree in
a variety of field, no one specific major necessarily) How can you stand out from the rest? So many people are applying, it&apos;s going to be
tough to be picked out of 200 or 500 applicants. What do employers seek the most? Confidence, good degrees, language skills? If the person is fortunate enough to find a good job that pays well, how can he or she increase the chances of keeping that job?
I&apos;ve also read that you should rent instead of buying a house, and that if you buy a house you should only do so if you know you&apos;re
going to live there at least 5 years. I think that makes sense, it wouldn&apos;t be wise to buy a house and then have to move out just 2 or
3 years later. But how can you really control that? The company might send you to a different location in another city, or simply layoff
a lot of people. I&apos;ve also seen well qualified, senior level employees who move around a lot, switching positions and locations
every 3 or 4 years. It seems the job market is very fluid and a lot of people are not sticking to one job or location for too long.
Finally, how realistic is it to start your own business and be your own employer, like having a home business?
Or else working for someone else but doing a lot of &quot;telecommuting&quot; where you do 90 percent of your work at home on the computer
and do a lot of phone calling and teleconferences? I think jobs that can be done in your pajamas in a comfy home office or at the beach
via internet and phone have a lot of appeal, but are rare to find. I know a few people who are able to do that, but not many. They still
work long hours and have to be on the ball, but at least they can do so from a mountain resort, living room, home office, instead of a little cubicle or hectic office
wearing a necktie and suit jacket. The work might be intense but the environment would be calm and relaxing.I do think that the age of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay, smartphones, telecommuting has brought in new employment styles and opportunities,
but how likely is it for someone to make a consistent monthly income from that? You can network much more easily and
reach potential clients or employers much more easily in the digital age, but how can you translate that into a consistent,
well paid job or business?I hope this starts a good discussion on a very important topic. All human beings need food, lodging, decent health care,
clothes, and a way to advance in life. For those of use who don&apos;t have a trust fund or an uncle who&apos;s chairman of the board, we&apos;re going to have to find a decent job to survive. I&apos;m also looking forward to reading the 2011 edition of the yearly Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread Good info there as well. New Federal Tax Plan Idea - What are you thoughts? 
 Added on : Thursday September 29th 2011 09:00:32 PM I&apos;m really tired of all the loopholes available for people to avoid paying taxes. We all use the resources provided from the federal government, we should all have to pay for them, right?Am I crazy? Here&apos;s my plan.5% Flat Tax - Everyone pays 5% of their gross income to taxes no matter how much or how little you make.
Deductions:
Having Dependent Children - until they are married or 21, whichever happens first ($1000 credit per kid)
Pre-Tax contributions to retirement plans, never to be taxed even when cashed out at age 65.Businesses should not have to pay any federal taxes at all, as a business entity.Here are my reasons.Like I typed earlier, everyone has the same resources available so everyone should be paying for them. Even if you&apos;re on welfare or social security, if you&apos;re getting a paycheck from somewhere other than you&apos;re own savings or retirement you should be paying some taxes back on that money. Sounds a little funny paying the government back on money they&apos;re paying you but maybe people won&apos;t rely so much on the government if they knew they still had to pay taxes on those dollars.Deductions for having kids because those people are providing the next generation of people who are going to support the economy. Sorry folks but without kids the world will die. I know when I&apos;m old and retired I want some young hot looking thing serving me drinks at my restaurant of choice, not some old fart like myself. Kids = future tax collections.Deductions for contributing to retirement to encourage people to be fiscally responsible and save as much as they can so they are not dependent on the government in any way in their old age. Not to be taxed going in and not to be taxed going out so that everyone has as much as possible when they retire. No fear of having that nest egg shrink considerably when it&apos;s time to withdraw. There&apos;d have to be a pre-set age on this, we don&apos;t want people thinking they can &quot;retire&quot; at 35 and cash out only to re-enter the workforce at 37 again, rinse and repeat.As far as I&apos;m concerned, it&apos;s none of the government&apos;s business how much medical expenses I have, if I&apos;m using my land for agricultural use, if I&apos;m driving a &quot;green&quot; vehicle, or anything else that&apos;s a current tax exemption to some degree or another.Why on earth should a business pay taxes as an entity just so it&apos;s employees can turn around and pay taxes again on that same exact money? This has always baffled me. Whether people get money from their stocks/investments or a paycheck as an employee - it&apos;s all taxed again after the business records it&apos;s profits. This is really bad business. We should be encouraging businesses - not disabling them by making them pay to operate when all the employees are already paying. If they didn&apos;t have to pay so many taxes, maybe they could hire more employees - who would then turn around and pay some taxes.I would love to have a non-mud-slinging discussion about this. Anyone else have thoughts on the matter? Should I Complete (Art) School? 
 Added on : Thursday September 29th 2011 03:01:01 PM I noticed that members have responded to such questions (&quot;Should I Quit Law School?&quot;), which are seemingly trivial to the community but personally momentous to the individual.I&apos;ve attended college, indifferently, for...years. I finally redirected myself into Fine Arts, which has always attracted me. Since, I&apos;ve achieved new accolades―I exhibited solo and now sell artwork―but I&apos;ve also relapsed into antipathy for much of the curriculum. A few weeks ago, I withdrew in disgust, with two classes remaining for an associate&apos;s degree and nine remaining for a bachelor&apos;s degree. I doubted that the instruction amounted to occupational skill.I&apos;m 28, and I still don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing. Sooner or later, I&apos;ll need income―to work &quot;a real job&quot;, not just enroll in college and work part-time. I have a limited amount of time and capital with which to experiment.I&apos;d like to establish myself. I&apos;d like to do something with my talent. This is a personal dilemma inasmuch as economic one.I would appreciate candid responses. $31.19 + Free/$8 shipping Tools of the Trade Basics Classic 12-Piece Cookware Set

 Added on : Tuesday September 27th 2011 06:02:01 AM Search &quot;bestbuy 2754052&quot; for the cached Bestbuy page.It&apos;s pretty much cleared out everywhere, but there are still some left. Today, BB&apos;s system said there was 9 left at the Montebello, CA at this price - all other S.Cal stores didn&apos;t have any.While it&apos;s not an amazing price at $229 for a single core netbook, it is cheaper than most out there brand new. Seems many netbooks are going for $250+ nowadays.
Microcenter stores do have refurbished netbooks starting at $199, so a better deal if you don&apos;t mind refurb&apos;s.The only notable point on this netbook that is a major plus vs others is the screen can fold open 180 degrees! Most other netbooks and laptops can&apos;t open completely, so when the notebook is in your lap, you often can&apos;t open the screen wide enough to get a comfy view.Yes, not fast or anything, but a decent 3lbs system for simple things like Office, web, email, and the like for students, penny pinchers, etc. Rite Aid 10/2 to 10/9 SCR&apos;s, UPs, Deals, Scenarios, Coupon Match Ups and Ad Scan (NOW up)

 Added on : Tuesday September 20th 2011 06:11:33 AM Great New Deal on the Saiga AK Rifle (i.e., this AK variant accepts standard AK-47 30-round mags)http://catalog.classicarms.us/itemdetail.php?itemnumber=LNGSAIGA...I would call them, rather than try to order online, and/or maybe fax your order ASAP, to ensure you get immediate access to whatever stock is available: Phone: (704) 684-0650.
Fax order form http://www.classicarms.us/pdf/order_form.pdfLimited time sale $419 each, $409 qty 2 or 3, $399 4 or more. Ground shipping for 2 to the Northeast was about $30, and, yes, to FFL (licensed firearms dealer) only. Haven&apos;t seen them at this price before. Ever. Bought 2 by phone with NO delay or hesitation. No upcharge mentioned for credit card, either. Costs $20 each to for paperwork at my local FFL.The unmodified 10-round-only Saiga are on sale for $319 each, too, $299 in quantity 4 or more, in most available gauges (223, 7x39, 410, 5x45). 308 is still $499, though. Google Saiga conversion to get details on possible mods to allow 30-round mags with these if they run out of the -AK variant.Great deal on their auto shotguns, too, if that&apos;s your thing.see http://www.classicarms.us/
and
http://www.classicarms.us/semi-auto%20rifles.htmPer their eBlast notes below, these original-branded AKs appear to be the last batch before a new exclusive US importer tries to lock up the market and drive price up.(From their eBlast newsletter &quot;Not only are these a super nice target and defensive rifle. They make a great deer rifle too. Hunting season is here and nothing beats this as a lightweight, fast handling deer gun. Since SKS rifles started coming into the country in the late 80&apos;s, there have probably been more deer harvested with the 7.62x39 round than any other caliber.This is a vast improvement on the SKS. Retains original Hunting rifle styling with the drop cone european style pistol grip stock. Full polymer furniture is weather resistant and simply wipes clean. 30 round mag and sem-auto for rapid follow up shots. Feeds soft point hunting ammo flawlessly. Sling swivels attached. Scope Rail attached to receiver. Mounts are inexpensive, easy to install, and work great. Mounts take standard 1&quot; weaver rings and is see thru allowing use of open sights as well. &quot;This one (our SAIGA-AK) accepts all high cap AK Mags or Drums. Also has a true pistol grip and original AK Rifle styling. Same great quality.The back story from the ClassicArms.com eBlast that went out yesterday:

&quot;Up until late 2009, one U.S. Importer had a monopoly on all of the Russian Saiga Rifles and Shotguns that came into the U.S. - During this period, the prices on these firearms were fairly stable as the importer had a monopoly and basically controlled the quantity imported and the market pricing.

At some point in late 2009 this importer had a parting of ways with the Russians and the Izhmash factory builders and lost exclusivity to bring these firearms into the U.S.

For a little over a year these firearms were off the U.S. market, but then in late 2010/ early 2011, they started showing up and being imported by a few different importers but with no exclusivity and at much higher prices as the Russians and the importers tried to take advantage of the market desire and recent un-availability of product.

An importer is now in the running to bring these firearms in under their own branding. Their plan , as it has been relayed to us, is to bring these firearms in under their own (very well known ) name, with their own logo stamped in the receivers. If this happens they hope to better control the number of units coming in and have a hand in setting a higher price point and stabilizing the market.

In regards to these guns, the original importers identification markings were still on the firearms, which had already been produced. The new importer doesn&apos;t want anything to do with the rifles that have the old import markings on them and , well this is where we were offered a deal too good to turn down. The new importer is in a hurry to start importing their own logo guns but the factory still had a fairly large batch of the already produced firearms in stock marked for the original importers to move. The new guys want to make a fresh start with new production guns, the factory wants to get rid of these existing guns so they can move on to new production with a fresh importer, and thats where we come in.

We were offered a large quantity of these brand new, never fired, factory boxed Saiga&apos;s at a fantastic price. Bottom line is both parties were dumping them so they could proceed to new business... We said - Oh Yeah, Great for us, and great for our customers...

And you as our loyal e-blast fans... get first dibbs.

Now for the haters, yes we know that we have sold lots of these, to lots of you, at a higher price in the past, Heck, we have paid substantially more on our previous batches to get these ourselves. In a perfect world we would always buy things at the lowest price the first time. Unfortunately, this is not a perfect world.

Imported firearms are to a certain degree commodities and the prices can fluctuate wildly based on availability, market conditions and as you can see, deals like the one outlined above... (Can somebody please send me my Enron stock money back?)
All we can do is try to bring you the fairest price possible based on what we paid. However, I honestly don&apos;t think you will ever see these rifles lower than this...

Production cost alone, along with excise tax and duties, would prohibit these from being able to go any lower, so if you buy now I sincerely think you are getting in at the lowest price possible. Not only that but we had to do a cash deal on these that left us strapped, so we are blowing some out on the front end to re-coup some operating capital. &quot;New Hot Deal - Best Price In The Country&quot; Rite Aid 10/2 to 10/9 SCR&apos;s, UPs, Deals, Scenarios, Coupon Match Ups and Ad Scan (when up)

 Added on : Monday September 19th 2011 12:00:13 AM Background Information:-undergraduate degree was in finance (in top 10)
-currently attending law school (in top 14)
-no work experienceI&apos;m going through a dilemma right now where I am wondering if I should quit law school and get a job instead. Before entering law school, I thought that I would be an ideal candidate for a career as a lawyer. Since then, I&apos;ve come to realize that I have little to no interest in studying the law. I feel that I am doing nothing but arguing semantics in my classes.This would not be an issue if it weren&apos;t for the fact that tuition at law schools is very expensive. I&apos;m essentially paying for most of my expenses with student loans, and I am conservatively estimating that I will end up with around $130-150 thousand in debt if I choose to stay. Taking that amount of loans would not be a problem if a job was guaranteed after graduation, but the job market for lawyers seems to be bleak right now except for the top graduates. In looking at the salary statistics of various law schools, I&apos;ve noticed that salaries have dropped dramatically since the peak of around 2007.My other problem is that I have no work experience or significant internships. While it seems foolish in hindsight, I didn&apos;t bother to pursue internships that would have helped me to land offers because I had my sight set on law school. What would be the best way to explain my situation to prospective employers? Also, what would be the best way to find a job at this point - should I try to network with alumni, post my resume on a company&apos;s job postings, or do all of the above? My final option is to stay in law school, but I strongly feel that I should assume this semester&apos;s loans to be a sunk cost and move on. To those reading this, what do you feel I should do at this point?Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. Save Our Species Endangered Species Coloring Book

 Added on : Wednesday September 14th 2011 12:00:06 AM Stumbled on a blog post called How to Obtain an Accredited Undergraduate Degree in 1 Year for $4,000. There&apos;s an additional blog post titled &quot;How to Skip the Ivy League Admissions Process and Graduate from Harvard for $40,000 or Less&quot;For those that don&apos;t yet have an undergraduate degree and would like to obtain one, you may find interest in options that are considered non-traditional. At the very least, I&apos;m hoping that this post will spark some interesting conversations.What is your stance on going this route for higher education?
The DIY College Degree&quot;Most undergraduate collegiate-level programs take a minimum of 4 years of full-time effort to complete, which is a huge opportunity cost. Programs with low signaling value (community colleges, etc.) tend to cost less, but the perceived lack of distinction undermines the reason youre getting the degree in the first place. Programs with high signaling value (Ivy League private universities, etc.) cost a huge amount several hundred thousand dollars, in some cases, which often requires you to mortgage the next 20-30 years of your life by taking on massive amounts of student loan debt. All programs have huge potential barriers as well: admissions, strict curricula, and bureaucracy, which essentially require you to get someone elses permission before getting started and increases the risk youll have to stay enrolled longer and pay more.Fortunately, Ive discovered an option thats the polar opposite a low-bureaucracy way to graduate with an accredited undergraduate college degree in 1 year for about $4,000, in a way that will make any potential employer interested in interviewing you.&quot; Amazon MP3 1.50 Off Select Indie Albums

$1/1 Emerald nuts 55&quot; LED Sanyo 120Hz 1080p HDTV WiFi @ Walmart BM $798 
 Added on : Wednesday August 31st 2011 12:01:31 PM WalMart has a Sanyo 55&quot; LED HDTV Model DP55360 with USB Wifi dongle - for $798 in store only.
This was in this week&apos;s ad starting 8/28/11, but it&apos;s one heck of an HDTV for the price.SANYO 55&quot; Class Edge-lit LED-LCD 1080p 120Hz HDTV, 1.25&quot; ultra slim design.
Walmart online Description shows previous price of $1348. You must go to the store to buy this, however.I called around to my 3 local Walmarts - The one I went to had the two on the endcap in electronics as of last night.If you call for stock, ask the local CS rep to simply look up the UPC of 008648307746 to see if they have it in stock, and then RUN.
Make sure you bring a good-size van, truck, or large enough car to handle a roughly 3&apos; x 5&apos; x 1&apos; box.

This TV isn&apos;t top of the line, but it&apos;s not bottom of the barrel, either. I think this Sanyo has more features (including Wifi) and picture than the current Insignia deal at BB for the same price. This 55&quot; replaces my 32&quot; tube Sanyo that I&apos;ve had to 10+ years with no troubles. I&apos;m not worried about the Sanyo name, especially at this price.Use a credit card that doubles your warranty (AMEX, VISA) and you&apos;ll have a 2-year warranty, anyhow.Reviews can be found on the net, and they&apos;re pretty decent. For example: AVSForumDescription:
The Sanyo LED LCD features the latest technology for the digital age. An Ethernet LAN port with a high speed ISP (internet service provider) is capable of downloading movies and music from Netflix, Vudu and Pandora. The digital tuner is Digital Clear QAM, capable of receiving unscrambled digital cable. Sporting a high gloss black finish, it will virtually disappear when the lights are dimmed for your movies, sports and favorite programs. You will enjoy this full array of HDMI, Component Audio/Video, Composite Audio/Video and RF inputs, with plenty of options for DVD, VCR, cable, satellite and external antenna hookups. A coaxial digital audio output allows you to connect the Sanyo LED LCD to a home entertainment receiver amplifier system for theater like sound. An additional PC/Mac input allows alternative use as a computer monitor. A USB input allows photo viewer display of JPEG photos. The detachable pedestal base stand allows the Sanyo LED LCD to be wall mounted.16:9 LCD panel

Digital TV Tuner: ATSC Recent Finance Grad 
 Added on : Sunday August 28th 2011 12:00:02 AM I recently graduated from a private university in Chicago with a Bachelors degree in Finance. Classes I&apos;ve taken during college included options, portfolio management and financial institutions. My college career services are poor, many of the jobs they post and say are only listed for our school are also listed at other schools such as Notre Dame. I&apos;ve applied for over 50 jobs. Does anyone have any advice on the job front? I had a clerk job with the Department of Justice for the last two years of college, I was granted a Top Secret Clearance. I&apos;ve applied for many government jobs, nothing! FY2011 was tight and FY2012 is much tighter, government jobs aren&apos;t working unless your a veteran or a disabled veteran, I&apos;m neither. I&apos;ve also applied at a couple of trading companies as a clerk, which has gotten me no responses. Other places I&apos;ve tried are Walgreen&apos;s corporate headquarters, Federal Reserve of Chicago and Farmers. I plan to call Menards and Cabelas this week too avoid an employment gap, not sure which one pays more but I don&apos;t want to ask and risk not getting the job. Most of the emails I get are from CDW, Primerica and Northwestern mutual. I trade as much as $10,000 in stocks and have done pretty good, I also do many bank bonuses from ibankdesign.

 Added on : Friday August 26th 2011 09:00:55 PM Although this mount is refurbished, I ordered one and it looked brand new to me. Also includes 30 day warranty. The cheapest new price I could find was about $140 and the cheapest refurb price I could find was about the same on eBay. But it appears to be the same seller. Anyway, here is the Amazon link. If I am not mistaken we are not supposed to post eBay links, if I am wrong I can post that as well. Just thought it is a pretty good deal for a motorized tilt mount for anyone looking since at this price it is about the same if not cheaper priced than non-motorized fixed mounts for anyone looking. It is my first hot deal posting so I hope I didn&apos;t break any rules and help someone out. Thanks.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KY1ZT4Manufacturer link with more details:

 Double major, or just minor? 
 Added on : Thursday August 18th 2011 06:00:11 PM Here&apos;s my predicament: I got an associate&apos;s at a community college. When I was at the community college, I did all of the classes I could that would transfer. However, I transferred in too many credits: I only need 25 or so credits to finish my degree, but I have to do 40 hours at the 4 year school in order to graduate.My degree will be in business management. However, I will have an extra 15 hours to throw around, so instead of doing underwater basket weaving, I plan on doing a minor in either human resources, economics, or finance. However, for another 10 hours or so, I could get a double major. Here&apos;s what I&apos;m wondering:1. Any preference between HR, economics, and finance? Is there a big difference in my job prospects by adding either of these as a minor, considering that I will already have the general business degree?
2. How much more is the major worth? Do you think employers would consider a major in any of these fields to be significantly more valuable than either a minor or a just general business degree?
3. What affect could this have on graduate admissions? If I attend graduate school I have firmly decided to go for either an MBA or Law. Would a double major help admissions into either of these schools?I am only considering this from a financial perspective, not an &quot;education as a way to achieve self-actualization&quot; or anything like that. I am not being cynical, I just want to limit the discussion. Texas Instruments TI-30X IIS 2-Line Scientific Calculator $9.00 @Amazon

 Added on : Tuesday July 19th 2011 06:00:09 PM So I have a check from my credit union for a new car loan at 2.49%. I was able to negotiate well below invoice on the car. That being said, now the dealer has offered 0% financing for a couple hundred dollars more on the car cost. The 0% depends on my credit score (which is excellent, so I&apos;m not worried about qualifying). The extra few hundred isn&apos;t that big of a deal compared to the amount that I will save if I actually take 5 years to pay off this car. I left specifics out on the car because I feel they are irrelevant details and just results in bickering about car brands. I don&apos;t want a used car because I have a small child and don&apos;t want to risk buying a lemon that will break down on me in 100 degree heat. Are there other fees that I should be asking about so that I&apos;m not surprised when I go in to do the credit app/financing? Should I just take the deal or try to haggle further? I know I will profit from the 0%, but I don&apos;t want to get bamboozled and stuck for hours arguing with their financing team. Advice?

23.6&quot; screen is measured diagonally from corner to corner Career Advice 
 Added on : Saturday June 25th 2011 12:00:10 PM I&apos;ve seen good advice for the most off topic things here at FW, and I was hoping that I could get in on some of it.I graduated college in July of 2010 with a Business Finance degree. After I graduated I got a job as an In-store Banker at a major bank in a remote town in Oregon, which I am currently still employed with. I was hoping that I could work my way into a more professional position using this as an entryway. To make a long story short it hasn&apos;t worked out that way. I&apos;m still in the same branch, and am no closer to getting a real job that I want than I was when I graduated last year. My career choice is one as a Financial Analyst, specifically Portfolio Management. IE Working for a mutual fund would be awesome. I took the CFA level I in June, but I wasn&apos;t able to join a study group because they&apos;re none around my area, and am unsure if I will pass. Grad school is not out of the question, but I will not go until my current student loans are paid off. (I have about 5 years left at the current rate that were going. We have $17,100.08 left.) My college GPA was about 2.9 and is not very competitive during these times. The reason that I want to be a financial analyst is that I am amazing with numbers, specifically in excel. I can have an excel sheet pump out numbers like you wouldn&apos;t believe, and can even do VBA programming in them. My internship was at a venture capital company as a Junior Analyst, so I am not without experience. I&apos;m willing to move the family just about anywhere for a decent job.I hate my current position and am in need of a new job, but I am not willing to go jobless and collect unemployment for many reasons. I want to, and like to work, and work hard.I&apos;m currently making $27,000 a year before taxes and FW deal income with a family of 4. I don&apos;t want to go into our expense because I follow the other great advice from finances on the other forums. I&apos;m more interested in how to increase my income to provide a better life for my family.There are a couple things I&apos;m trying to figure out, they are:
1 Should I pay for premium recruiting services to help me find a job? I&apos;ve heard good things about things like Linked In Job-seeker accounts, and resume writers like https://secure.chapmanservices.com/. But $325 for a resume that may or may not help with my low income is questionable.2 Should I get a second job? I really don&apos;t want a second job, but am seriously considering it. I really enjoy spending the time with my kids when I get home. PS Wife getting a job is out of the question for personal reasons. My in-store banking hours really suck and I would really need to get a night job like at a gas station that would leave me completely beat all the time. I&apos;m considering doing some stock trading models to see if I can make some money on technical trading analysis.3 Should I change my career choice away from financial analysis? It&apos;s not unreasonable to say to me with my low GPA I am a beggar and not a chooser of my career.4 Should I just keep my current job and not rock the boat? Though I&apos;m fairly miserable with the job we are getting by OK. We are certainly staying afloat with our current income. I absolutely am not willing to quit without a new job lined up.Thanks VIZIO M470NV 47-Inch 1080p LED LCD HDTV $798 Free Ship

 Added on : Wednesday June 22nd 2011 12:00:07 PM **********Warning - This is likely going to be a blog type thread**********I was looking around for some economic material that analyzes the phenomenon of &quot;deal hunting&quot;. By deal hunting - I mean any economic activity where we (the FW crowd) employ our &quot;expertise&quot; and time to buy cheap electronics (&quot;Hot Deals&quot;), do AORs (FWF) or look for advice on minimizing day to day expenses (e.g. maintaining our car).There seem to be piecemeal, and incomplete materials out there. e.g. the entire marketing literature is full with discussions on the product price curve - where we try to be in the far end of the tail. I&apos;m not entirely sure (admittedly I&apos;m a novice in this area relying only on google searches) if they have really caught up on the internet fueled rise in deal hunting.The internet driven rise of deal hunting is probably a part of a much bigger economic shift. The free information flow brings down a lot of barriers that existed in the years bygone. The rank of middle managers have shrunk significantly since the age of internet. Outsourcing (both off and on-shore) is now at a level not even possible to imagine earlier.For any economic activity - you can either rely on the market at large, or on another organized entity (like a corporation). e.g. to maintain your car - you may choose to leave it at the dealership, pay the bill and forget about it, or you could purchase expertize and labor from an indy mechanic, buy your own parts from autozone and manage the whole effort with the potential for saving a lot of money (at the cost of some effort and assuming some of the risk in the whole project), or you could even go pure DIY. Many of the FWF style activities (searching around for the best rates in reward checking accounts, e.g.) are possible simply because the internet allows us to use the markets to a much greater degree than relying on one single organized entity (i.e. relying on your neighborhood bank to manage all your economic affairs).For sure - much of the loopholes in the promotional campaigns we utilize will likely go down as tech becomes even more pervasive and closes down these loopholes.Are you guys aware of any attempt at serious (or even semi-serious) research that focuses on the economics of deal hunting? Better still - are there any watered down versions of some serious research (palatable to a dilettante like me) out there on topics related to this? CVS 7/3 - 7/9 deals

Compass Blue Intense Red/Grill Peatmoss Char-Griller Super Pro Charcoal Grill, $89 at Lowes w/ Mover coupon 
 Added on : Saturday June 18th 2011 09:00:51 PM In my opinion, this is the best bang for your buck out there for a solid charcoal grill / smoker. I just picked one up today, and printed out a homedepot 10% off I had already used from an email, Lowes takes it no problem. I&apos;m n the process of smoking some baby back ribs - have it holding 190-200 degrees on regular kingsford. Very solid grill, I&apos;m already obsessed with it -- adjustable damper&amp;chimney stack, cast iron grates, cedar slats for the tables, heavy duty adjustable charcoal tray&amp;a cast iron grabber hook.

 Added on : Wednesday June 01st 2011 06:00:15 PM Here&apos;s the story. Just graduated with a degree in Communications from a 4 year state school. Just got a good job making a good amount of money (32k). I am by no means drowning or screwed, but I still was hoping to get some advice from the financial wizards on this forum as to anything I can do to lessen my burden. Here are my stats:Chase - $4k - Card closed, on a deal for 6% interest and a $79 monthly payment for 5 years
Citi - $7k - Card closed, on a deal for 0% interest and a $122 monthly payment for 5 years
HSBC - $1500 - Card closed, 10% APR
Pen Fed - $2k - Card open, 14.49% APR
AMEX Costco - $1900 - Card temporarily closed, 0% APR for 6 months
AMEX Business - $1800 - Card temporarily closed, 0% APR for 6 monthsOn top of this, in 6 months I get to start paying student loans. They break down like this:Private Loan - $20k - 5.5% APR
Federal Loan - 37.5k - 5.2% APR once I consolidateI know the student loans are high, I moved to go to a particular school because they said after a year they would give me in-state tuition (I am 27 and since I had years of tax returns showing I worked full time they said this wouldn&apos;t be a problem). I moved, at the end of the year they rejected me. I stayed because I only had one more year of school left. During that year they merged colleges (not the actual college but just my major), which disqualified 30 of my credits thereby forcing me to stay another year (I couldn&apos;t have moved colleges at this point as I had 90 credits and most colleges only accept 59 or so to transfer). One option I am looking at is going to grad school. I have been accepted to University of North Dakota&apos;s MBA program which is only 10k, is online (meaning I can stay where I am which is Phoenix), and can get federal, subsidized loans (some of which, I figure $2500 per year, can go towards credit cards). The interest won&apos;t start till after I graduate so I figure I can use that money to pay off my higher interest credit cards. If anyone has an opinion here or a better idea, please let me know.Once again, this isn&apos;t going to be to hard to deal with, but any advice on how to better deal with this would be very appreciated.

 Added on : Friday May 27th 2011 12:02:16 PM I know, I know. At the screen sizes projected EVERYONE will look down their noses at its mere 720p resolution. Owners of this projector will therefore feel great shame and a feeling of intense emptiness. Of course, their wallets will also be fatter. But no matter, because on top of being soooooo 2009, this product is also a refurb, which must surely mean it&apos;s crap. In all seriousness, this was a lower tier home theater projector, and refurbished products do carry bulb concerns. Plus, even though it&apos;s LCD, it doesn&apos;t have lens shift, which is one of LCD&apos;s major selling points for projectors. Still, for someone who wants to get their feet wet with a projector (and I highly recommend doing so to see if front projection is for you before splurging on a higher end model), this offers a great opportunity.

to help you move to fashion Perfect roast beef everytime with this thermometer, $13.84 shipped w/ PRIME @ Amazon 
 Added on : Wednesday May 25th 2011 09:01:00 AM Taylor 1470 Digital Cooking Thermometer/TimerI wasn&apos;t charged tax or shipping (I have Prime).I have never been able to make a good roast beef mostly due to not being able to tell the internal temperature (or so I have found out). People are so impressed and well......so am I. I have made dozens since I bought this thermometer and have a perfect roast every time. I buy a big top round, plop it in a pan, stick in the probe and put it in a 325 degree oven. We like ours med rare to medium and I find that cooking it to 125 degrees internally is perfect. Take it out when it reaches temperature and LET IT SIT for 20-30 minutes BEFORE slicing if you plan on serving right away. If I&apos;m making it to slice thin (with the meat slicer) and put in the fridge for sandwiches for the week I won&apos;t slice it until the following day. Let it cool, cover, and put in the fridge overnight. It&apos;s better than ANY deli sliced roast beef I have found and FAR cheaper!One problem with these type of thermometers (all probe ones, not just Taylor models) is that the probes only last so long, especially when using at temps over 350 degrees. My suggestion is to purchase a couple of extra probes to keep on hand. It is suggested to wrap the flexible coil portion of the probe in several layers of foil, paying attention to the joint between the probe and the coil and change every 3-4 uses. Replacement probes are available from TAYLOR but you have to MAIL IN YOUR PAYMENT as they don&apos;t have online ordering from the company directly. They are $5 each shipped. Their address is ...Taylor Service Center

Las Cruces, NM 88001 USA I use this thermometer for heating milk when making yogurt. It&apos;s nice just to put it in the milk and not have to stand there and hold it while your hand gets hotter and hotter. I&apos;ve used it for making maple sugar candies too. It has a magnet on the back so I put it on the top of stove for easy viewing. It lies flat or you can angle it as it&apos;s hinged. It has a timer too. It&apos;s a great little item I cannot live without in my kitchen.BON APPETIT !! Another unique student loan situation... help? 
 Added on : Tuesday May 24th 2011 09:00:45 PM Hi all,I did a bit of research on the forums here before posting, but I apologize in advance if any questions asked sound redundant.A bit of background: I&apos;m a single 25 y/o college grad working full time as a computer tech (for a pretty high profile company). Been with the company about a year and a half, and got a promotion at the end of October last year. My current salary is ~47k year (not counting OT), living and working in the NYC market. I have no credit card debt, but meager savings (about 10k between my portfolio&amp;401k). Since cost of living here is so high I find it hard to put any money away (that&apos;s not being deducted from my paycheck, at least).My parents never went to college, but wanted the best for me. Unfortunately, neither them nor I knew very much about paying for college. So, I went to a state university and, four years later, graduated with a degree in journalism and about 60k of debt. Now, four years after leaving college, my parents are divorcing and their lawyers are apparently making my college debt a key issue.It&apos;s important to know that for a long while after graduation, we were making payments using a few cashed bonds my great grandmother had left behind for me. When that ran out, I started paying $250 a month, and my dad has been chipping away at the Parent PLUS loan each month as well. I guess the fundamental problem is that my name is on my Stafford Loans, and my dad&apos;s name is on the Parent PLUS loan. They want the debt out of my father&apos;s name, but according to everything I&apos;ve read, the Parent PLUS loan is in his name forever and always.Here are the details.EdFinancial - $11,514.97

Consolidation - UNSUB /
SALLIE MAE TRUST - LSC/FLRepayment02/07/2007$46,149.276.125%
Aside from a general repayment strategy, I am looking for advice on how to get all of this debt not only into my name, but into a manageable monthly payment. The lawyers suggested I take a loan out from a private lender (a credit union or something to that effect), and pay off both loans in their entirety, thereby consolidating (in a more roundabout way) to a single debt.I like to think I&apos;m pretty savvy when it comes to personal finance, but loans/consolidation are areas outside of my current grasp. I&apos;m making a concerted effort to learn about it real quick though. Any and all advice is welcome.Thanks,

 Added on : Tuesday May 24th 2011 12:00:55 AM Ok here is my situation. Basically I feel like I am screwed.I spent FOUR years in retail after high school. I did great and was promoted twice and ended up as a department manager at a major big box. I have LOTS of retail experience.After that I got a college degree (Associates - AA) and got a job at AT&amp;T;as a telecom technician. Absolutely HATED it and left after a few months.Then I went to work for the state government for two years as an administrative assistant. Got laid off 4 months ago. I am only a year away from finishing my 2nd college degree (bachelors of science in criminal justice) from a state university, but I am kind of screwed because most of the higher paying jobs out there won&apos;t even look at me until the degree is totally finished so those are out of the question.Now I just need ANY job fast to help pay the bills and LOTS of retailers around here are hiring. I thought I would be a prime candidate with 4 years of retail experience with two of those in retail management right? WRONG.I have had literally four interviews in the past month with retailers and every time I keep getting told I am &quot;not qualified&quot; and I keep getting asked &quot;Why are you trying to work in retail?&quot;. Well WTF? To pay the bills.How am I NOT QUALIFIED to be a cashier or stocker or any other retail job especially since I did it before? It makes no sense. What is going on??? Do you have to have a masters degree to work retail now? Degree Deodorant 1 for $0.34 @ Target (YMMV)

Reviewed here.Excerpt from consumersearch.com:Reviewers say to look for the following when buying a home espresso machine:
The best espresso machines meet industry guidelines for espresso preparation. True espresso is made with 1.5 ounces of water heated to 195 degrees Fahrenheit, forced through 7 grams of finely ground espresso at no less than 9 atmospheres of pressure (130 psi) within 20 to 25 seconds. This results in a shot topped with about 1/4 inch of crema, the golden foam that&apos;s a hallmark of good espresso.
*Look for a pump-driven machine. Steam-driven models can&apos;t maintain the correct water temperature or generate adequate pressure.
*Generally speaking, heavier, bulkier espresso machines can withstand more abuse. That&apos;s because they often use metal in their construction instead of plastic.
*Budget for a top-quality bean grinder. Mark Prince of CoffeeGeek.com says that if your budget is $500, you should spend half on an espresso machine and half on a top-quality burr grinder. He adds that the grinder is far more important than the espresso machine. Blade grinders can&apos;t grind coffee beans finely enough for espresso. See our companion report on coffee grinders.
*Look for a cup warmer, detachable water reservoir and removable drip tray. Owners say many drip trays are too shallow, but you can position a bowl beneath them to catch any runoff.
*Pod models are easy to use. However, purists say that learning to use an espresso machine is half the fun. Free Degree Mens Deodorant at Target

 Added on : Saturday May 21st 2011 12:01:10 PM Hey guys and gals, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard this one a million times on here before...First of all, this is my first post, I joined solely with the idea of getting help on this topic (and I already got free batteries!). I&apos;m a 26 year old dude, and a registered nurse in the ICU at one of Chicago&apos;s top hospitals. In order to get here, however, I attended an accelerated nursing program at a private university. In order to get into the accelerated program (18 months for a BSN instead of 4 years), I needed to use the other Bachelor&apos;s degree I had obtained from the same private university. That one&apos;s in Graphic Design. I won&apos;t bore you with the details, but I had a change of heart, that why such different fields. Along this 6 year journey, I acquired about $180,000 in student loan debt. The way this happened was the stars aligned and I slipped into every loophole on the planet. 1) When I started school I had very little guidance from my folks and the people at school. FAFSA told me my parents made too much money and their &quot;expected family contribution&quot; was a good chunk of my tuition...sad to say, there&apos;s no box to check for &quot;extremely selfish parents&quot;. I got nothing from them. I was forced to go the Private (read: Signature Loan from Sallie Mae) route. Of course I could have not gone to such an expensive school, but that&apos;s what a more mature me sees, not a younger, dumber me. In addition, I was unable to work during the accelerated program per requirements, and I was required to live off-campus since I was married, which meant I needed to include rent into my loans. Almost all of my loans are private, as said before. So, the interest (which started to get higher and higher as my debt level increased), ended up tacking like $30,000 onto my loans when I finished my first degree. Now, before anyone says anything, I was pretty frugal. My rent was $925/mo. I had no car payments, my wife was working, we didn&apos;t have &quot;toys&quot;, etc. I just got stuck in a bad situation. Here is my current monthly situation:
Student Loans $1500 (minimum)
Rent $925
Insurance $180
Gas $300
AT&amp;T;$45
ComEd $70
T-Mobile $177
Misc. $150
Spending $60
Prescription/Dr. $60
Food/Diapers $400The Misc. is for car repairs, wedding gifts, etc. The spending is $30 for me, and $30 for my wife...per month. We do have two young daughters, but my wife makes all their food, so they don&apos;t cost much at all. I have NO credit card debt, NO car loans, NO bad habits or vices...I sold my Jeep, my dream vehicle, and bought a used Honda Civic to cut down on gas. Please help me. I am already on a special interest-only style payment plan with Sallie Mae for like 3 more years, and I&apos;m not sure I can afford it when it comes back up. I am working full time, and the night shift to get the extra differential. I also have a second job working 2 additional 12 hour shifts (5 total) per week. I&apos;m making like $44/hr at the second job, too, so the pay is good. We had our second daughter in February, and it didn&apos;t make much financial sense to send both our daughters to daycare when it would cost around 50-60% of my wife&apos;s salary. So, she has just started staying home. Guys, I&apos;m doing it right. I went to school, I got a degree (in a field that is 100% devoted to helping people), and I have NOTHING. I can&apos;t even buy a car or a house because these student loans are destroying me. $1500/month? Are you kidding me? Add that to the $925 I pay in rent and I should be able to be living the good life! I fully understand it&apos;s my debt, and I have earned it, but what can I do? Is there no law against charging someone 25% of their salary for loans?Please folks, give me your advice! No one will consolidate this amount of loans, especially private. My parents have since blown through all of their money (although my four younger brothers and sisters have all learned from my mistakes, which is good). I&apos;m just lost, and it&apos;s really starting to effect my attitude (that, and working 5-6 days a week), and that&apos;s effecting my relationship with my wife and kids...and I hate that. Thanks in advance. DanePS - my wife has recently gotten really into couponing as a way to save more money. And I understand I have a decently high phone bill, but that&apos;s the only creature comfort we really have. We&apos;re honestly considering getting rid of our dogs because they cost money to feed... Who to trust and where to turn upon 250k inheritance 
 Added on : Saturday May 21st 2011 09:00:30 AM Hey guys,I recently found out that I will be inheriting 250k. First, my situation: 34 years old with bachelor&apos;s degree in the PR field,not married but living with girlfriend.Had to take a severe severe paycut after losing previous job and now only make 30k per year. The state I live in is New York and I live in a 2 bedroom condo that is paid off. I have 0 credit card debt and no car payments as I have a 2005 Jeep that I take care of and assume it will last me years.I am a very frugal person to an extent and do not really care much for material things. The only areas where I go outside my frugalness is dining out quite a bit. Every time I thought about coming across some money, I always came to the conclusion that the one thing I ever really wanted TO BUY is financial security and peace of mind for the rest of my life. Not to be mega rich or accumulate useless material things.So now I am going to get this money and I DON&apos;T want to spend any of it at all. I want to know where do I turn to to help me manage this money so that it can grow at a nice rate. Eventually, I would like to be in a situation 20-25 years from now where I am drawing about 150k per year in interest and not touching the principle. Is this possible?They always say the best manager of your money is yourself. Sorry to be rambling but my head is still spinning. Just need some advice. A direction if you will. Thank you.

This Deal Has Expired Brining my lunch; can I cut my costs? 
 Added on : Tuesday May 17th 2011 03:00:25 AM Hard times hit and work gave us a 10% pay cut at work in lieu of lay offs as negotiated by the Union. I started bringing my own lunch, but I&apos;m finding that the cost of lunch isn&apos;t much different than if I were buying it.Typical lunch:Sandwich roll, 90c
Lunch meat (usually turkey or ham), about 3oz, $1.40-1.80 ($7.50- $9 per pound for the non-water added/water product type of lunch meat)
Cheese, 1 slice, 20-30c. $4ish for 16 slices, 1lb
Mustard, est 10c; $4 for a bottle that lasts me about 1-2 months
Avocado, $1 (once or twice a week only since it is so expensive)
Baby carrots, 30c @ $1.50 for 2 lb bag that lasts me about 1 weekTotal: $$2.75-4.25I&apos;m buying the stuff and then keeping it in the fridge at work aside from the bread which I&apos;m buying daily on the way to work. I don&apos;t have a way to reheat food at work other than a small electric oven which is big enough for about two slices of bread (not the top load type of toaster).Comparatively when I was buying sandwiches from the deli, they were about $6 each. I guess I&apos;m saving about $2-3 or so but at the end of the week, $10-12 just doesn&apos;t seem like all that much and kind of demotivating. I guess it pays for my coffee...Speaking of coffee, I started making it at work. Half-pound of grounds is enough for about 10 days and costs about $6. So 60c daily for grounds, 3c for a filter to make 16 oz of coffee. At 63c it is less than half the $1.50 the coffee shop charges for a 12 oz cup. Savings is 87c per day. There is a hot water dispenser at work that dispenses 200 degree water which is about right for coffee. (This does not include the buy 10lbs get 1 free promo from the coffee shop or 15c discount for using my own bag.)Total savings is under $3 a day and less than $15 a week. Somehow, this just doesn&apos;t seem all that motivating to put in the effort.Advice? Belkin Conserve Switch Surge Protector with Remote, 8-Outlet $24.99 fs @ buy.com

 Added on : Thursday May 12th 2011 12:00:59 AM Hi there,I am a US citizen/resident with serious health issues. My dad lives in Canada by himself and is 83 years old and will reside in Canada by himself for the remainder of his life for a number of reasons including insurance. While his health is good right now his decision making is starting to show poor judgement. To make matters worse he is a horrific communicator, doesn&apos;t use a computer and his hand writing is illegible.Given my poor health I would like to be proactive and utilize some kind of estate planning/certified financial planner. My dad has told me everything is in his drawer at his apartment which is usually full of crap, loose papers, etc....The purpose in hiring this individual is to find somebody familiar with Canadian law who can have an organized list of all of his required information: From living wills, trustee, medical arrangements, doctor phone #, lawyer phone #, deeds to residence, car title, assets, benefits, etc... I have none of this info.I know fatwallet is focused on saving money. However, in this instance I don&apos;t mind spending the money necessary (i know it won&apos;t be cheap) to have his affairs in meticulous order.What type of person should I try to find in Canada?In the US it would be either an estate planning attorney or CFP or ???Who should I try to find in Canada? What title/designation/degree?Thanks in advance... Possible investment for a start-up business, have a few questions 
 Added on : Monday May 09th 2011 06:00:39 AM Greeting all! (By the way, in my last thread concerning a muscle car i was selling, the guy ended up coming through with a cashier&apos;s check, thank God!)My question(s) involve a business venture that a longtime friend and his friend are starting. My friend is 30 with a degree in computer science; he is a web developer for some company. His partner is a professor at a college who teaches computer science and the like, he is 48 with a family. My friend knows I have a history of helping fund small start ups so he went to me recently asking me if I was interested in being an angel/venture capitalist.Some details: What they wrote me: This start-up money is just the tip of the iceberg. In reality we&apos;ll probably end up needing over 100k but this will give us enough to get the site up and running and making money. The rest of the money will probably be for marketing throughout the first year or two. Also, the wages will probably only last us through the summer. The other areas could possibly last through the year except for marketing. $5000 - Professional fees: Legal, drafting document such as non-disclosure agreements, attorney fees for ongoing consultation, hiring and retaining an accountant.$15,000 - Technology costs: Computer hardware (development box and monitors, production server), computer software (website development and maintenance, security measures - ie., Web Security consulting firm, IT consulting)$10,000 - Administrative costs: Office/Rent, supplies, anything needed on a daily basis to operate a business (should be able to last for almost a year and may not need much initially)$15,000 - Sales and marketing costs: Logo and Web design (external only), marketing materials, advertising, public relations, event or trade show attendance or sponsorship, travel and entertainment for client meetings, mailing or lead lists. (this could end up being a lot more than 15k) $25,000 - Wages and benefits: Employee salaries, payroll taxes, Sales Rep. commissions, etc. (This will probably only be enough for the summer)Whatever you want to invest is up to you. We&apos;re looking for 30-60 from you. Our goal is to get you a 100% return and have our loans paid back within the first two years but to be safe we&apos;ll set up the 8 year agreement with the ability for early payback. We&apos;ll most likely want the payment plan to be yearly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I do not wish to divulge exacts of what the company will do but there are similar models in place which seem to be successful. The model operates off of commissions. i wish to know what would be a fair an honest payback (assuming it becomes profitable.) I told them something along the lines of 2x&apos;ing my money in under 8 years (which works out to 10% interest more or less). Added into this would be 5% of the sale of the company, whatever it can sell for if they decide to sell down the road. If they become millionaires off of my investment, I would like some assurance that I will be &quot;taken care of&quot; as well, but I also do not wish to be greedy. Can someone point me in the right direction with this?PS 70k will run me pretty dry but I have a secure job and have money tied up in other positive performing investments, so I am not worried about having a 3-6 month emergency fund.

 Added on : Saturday May 07th 2011 12:02:08 AM In general, my question is this:
Once a person has obtained a degree in something that is not particularly practical- philosophy, art history, underwater basket weaving- how do you make the best of this situation financially? What advice would you give (preferably other than go back and get a degree in something useful)?Here&apos;s the specific situation of the friend I&apos;m asking for:
He has just earned degrees in English and history. Work experience consists of the morning shift at FedEx Ground during the school year, fast food in the summers and previously in high school, and for one month a year in college, he led a bus load of younger workers in a farm-related job (he does have a CDL to drive a bus). His job search is further complicated by the fact that he is getting married this summer and will move to wherever his fiancee can find a teaching job. They will almost certainly live in a small town. If she does not find a job, the backup plan is to open a restaurant/bar with his father-in-law&apos;s money (in a very small town where FIL lives). I&apos;ll admit that a big part of the reason I&apos;m posting this is for help in pointing out all of the things that should be considered before taking on such an endeavor. I&apos;m an accountant, but I won&apos;t waste any space trying to convince anyone that I don&apos;t have a friend. GearWrench Deals from TrueValue.com - Free Ship To Store (YMMV) 
 Added on : Friday May 06th 2011 06:02:40 PM I made this a YMMV because the site says &quot;Free shipping to your participating store&quot;.True Value typically carries these 4 piece sets (model # 8112, item # 134077 in SAE [truevalue.com] and model # 8120, item # 134078 in Metric) for $9.97 each which is a fairly good deal. The SAE set comes with 3/8, 7/16, 1/2&amp;9/16 and the metric includes 10mm, 12mm 13mm&amp;14mm. For about $20 you can have a good starter set.Their current deals beyond these above are:GearWrench 8-Pc. Ratcheting Combination Wrench Set

Didnt see the 10-Piece set above offered in metric from True Value.** Free ship to your local (participating) store. **Im a bit of a GearWrenchaholic so I already own these sets and I absolutely love them. As a matter of fact, if I thought I could get away with it, Id order another set of each as Mother&apos;s Day gifts for the wife but I value my sliver of the bed too much. Yes, they are made in Taiwan (Country of Origin = CN - aka China) but all mine are holding up great so far. As has been mentioned in previous GearWrench posts, MOST Sears stores will honor the Lifetime Warranty on these as they carry GearWrench too and if not, True Value definitely will. Happy Wrenching!

 Added on : Saturday April 30th 2011 01:42:30 AM Adorama has the Sunpak PZ40X II hot shoe flash for SLR cameras on special for $69.95 with free super saver shipping. They have them available for Canon, Nikon, Konica-Minolta and in black or silver finish. They are over $100 elsewhere. This is a good starter flash for those just getting into SLR photography or for those who don&apos;t need to take photo after photo all in a row. The refresh times are slower since it uses only 2 AA batteries. If you are looking for something better than the pop up flash and can&apos;s justify spending huge bucks on the name brand flashes, this may be just what the doctor ordered.

Sunpak, a division of ToCAD America Inc. announces the upgraded version of the popular Sunpak PZ40X, a compact, lightweight, full-featured, shoe-mount electronic flash unit for digital and film cameras. The new Sunpak PZ40X II retains all the advanced features of the previous model, but it is now dedicated to the top-selling Canon Rebel/Rebel XT, EOS 20D. The new Sunpak PZ40X II also works manually with non-dedicated cameras employing a single-contact hot shoe. The PZ40X-II is also backwards-compatible- with TTL metering for all TTL flash Canon cameras. And even though it is 40% smaller and significantly lighter than previous flash units with the same features, the Sunpak PX40X II has an impressive ISO 100 Guide Number Range from 60 at the 24mm zoom-head setting to 120 at 80mm.The Sunpak PZ40X II provides such advanced features as TTL auto flash, ETTL II for Canon, a large, backlit, full-info LCD, and a power zoom-bounce flash head covering 35mm-equivalent focal lengths from 24-80mm in continuously variable auto mode, or 5 manual steps. Tilt positions range from zero to straight up for maximum bounce flexibility, and the built-in, near-IR auto-focus-assist beam turns on automatically when needed. Other features include: 5 power ratio settings down to 1/16, flash-exposure confirmation, bar graph flash range display, and power-saving circuitry that automatically set the unit to Standby Mode after five minutes. The PZ40X II is powered by two NiMH, NiCd or Alkaline AA cells and is available in digital titanium silver or all black finish.

 Added on : Sunday April 24th 2011 01:40:21 AM God I hope I can pull this off...First off these are not my debts, they&apos;re debts on commercial real estate, owned by my parents, from the 2004-2006 era. Some of them have been modified/refi&apos;d recently to lower the interest rates. All were at or above 8% APR originally.Unfortunately we were foreclosed on one property and lost quite a bit of down payment monies and principal paid there.
We have settled quite a few debts already and are settling some now.Attached is a chart with the remaining debts.I have already reduced business expenses by reducing our phone/cable/electric/internet/gas bills as much as I can ~4k-5k/month.
I have also paid off a lease at 10.5% interest with a balance of 13k and am going to use that $650 payment toward the debt.
The plan is to settle loan #1 for about 25k-27k now and apply that payment to the next loan.
Even though I have always believed in paying the highest rate debt first, with debts of this size I think snowball method is the only feasible option.Loan# ------ Remaining Balance ---- Rate --------Payment
1 ------------- $32,694.19 --------------- 8.00% ------- $606.64
2 ------------- $165,618.25 ------------- 6.00% -------- $1,922.05
3 ------------- $200,000.00 ------------- 9.00% -------- $1,500.00
4 ------------- $426,178.70 ------------- 7.50% -------- $3,625.17
5 ------------- $785,545.51 ------------- 6.50% -------- $5,021.30
6 ------------- $779,114.83------------- 7.00% -------- $5,654.23
Total---------- $1,610,036.65 --AVG- 7.33% -------- $18,329.39 - Total monthly P+I pmt.
We do have substantial income but it&apos;s seasonal. The summer/autumn months are death for our business/location and we are barely able to keep up then.Luckily since I manage the finances now instead of the parents, I have put every last penny we earn away and use AARP to boost our savings by putting about 25k+ worth of expenses on the card.Our assets have reduced in value by about 75% since we purchased them. I have a bunch of 0% APR checks ranging from 20k-25k, and every few months have been getting some no/low fee BT monies. We have 1 free and clear property where I am trying to get a line of credit on so that when the 0% period expires I can pay off the cards, rinse and repeat.I plan on paying off the high rate debts at 0% and making maximum payments to pay off these debts ASAP.I was encouraged to go back to school, acquire more debt, and get a graduate degree. I think I am rather going to get a contract job, with few benefits, and apply all cash, minus savings, to help paying off this debt.ANY ADVICE WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED! Even if it is critical. I posted this because reading previous stories has inspired me to write here and stick to it. Thank you Fatwallet. Energy EW-100 Subwoofer $129.99 fs @ newegg / ends 4/24

1 year limited Paying down my CC debt; looking for advice 
 Added on : Friday April 22nd 2011 10:40:45 PM Hello FW, I&apos;ve been a lurker on and off for some time. I&apos;m not nearly as financially savvy as many of you, but I do read and try to understand what I can to try and get a grasp on how to make the most of my money. Like many others, however, hard times have come upon me (for different reasons, though), so I&apos;m here, asking for some advice as to how to handle this situation.C/N: I have ~$7k in high interest CC debt (30%). What can I do to pay this down more quickly?Details:I&apos;m a 22 year old college student. A degree is still a few years away. My parents have been paying my tuition up to this point, but my younger brother will be enrolling next semester, so I&apos;ll be finding my own way to finance my education, as I don&apos;t feel that it&apos;s fair to them that they need to keep paying while I drag my feet.This debt came to be through a combination of poor spending habits and a slew of personal problems (which I can detail if is needed). I&apos;ve curbed the poor spending by creating a monthly budget and sticking to it. The personal problems are still there, but that&apos;s a different discussion.I have a crap job; I manage a fast-food &apos;restaurant&apos;. $12/hr, as many or as few hours as I like, but I&apos;ve been working ~35/week during school. I grossed about $21k last year. I&apos;ll work what I can during the summer if I don&apos;t take any classes. I&apos;m constantly searching for new employment, particularly in a field related to my degree, but nothing has come through yet. I won&apos;t cry &apos;bad economy&apos;, because there are definitely some employers that weren&apos;t interested in me for their openings. My resume isn&apos;t exactly stellar. Most jobs that I&apos;d qualify for would pay less than my current one, which is why I&apos;ve stayed put.Credit karma says my credit score is a 720. It also says I have $10k in savings, which I don&apos;t. Maybe this is an account my parents have with my name on it; I don&apos;t really know. I have two cards; a Bank of America platinum plus something-or-other ($1k limit, open since 06) and a Citi ThankYou card ($7k limit, open since 07). Like I said, interest is at around 30%, so that&apos;s around $200/month I&apos;m losing just paying interest. My only real expenses are rent ($500/mo for now) and utilities (maybe $200/mo in the summer, up to $500/mo in the winter).I have a car; it&apos;s not worth much, and I&apos;d like to avoid selling it if I can (I&apos;m a gearhead, so cars are worth wasting money on, in some respects). I&apos;ve been contemplating going car-less when it warms up enough to walk, until the fall when it becomes too cold to walk anymore. This will save me some money on registration, insurance, and fuel. It&apos;s only worth about $4k as it sits, and if I sold it I wouldn&apos;t be able to replace it with something similar for anything close to that, which (in my head) is why I&apos;m hesitant to sell it. Again, if we need to go in to more detail here, I&apos;m glad to.I see my options as this:1) Find a CC (or several) with BT offers (anything will be better than what I&apos;m paying now) and pay them down as aggressively as possible. This probably wont cover the full balance, I imagine. Close the accounts when finished?2) See if the credit union will give me a personal loan to reduce the interest rate. I previously had a loan at 10%, so that would help out some.3) Ask Citi if they have any programs for assisting in reducing my interest?4) ???Any and all help, advice, flames, or bashes are appreciated.

 Added on : Friday April 15th 2011 10:40:04 AM Hi all! I got some really good advice in my last thread and was wondering if some of you experienced tax accountants could help me out with a question. I applied for an entry-level tax accountant position with a company in Texas. I live in Georgia. I used my actual address and phone number on the application and typically when I do that, people in other states won&apos;t even so much as call me back. However, this place did. It&apos;s in an area north of Houston that is apparently known for having women a little bit too tan and with boobs a bit too big to be real (not my style at All lol).The position calls for a tax accountant to help prepare tax returns for the business, help them keep track of fixed asset reporting, maintain paperwork for quarterly tax payments, and help out with sales tax compliance overall. I have experience in taxation but only on an individual level. I know that taxation is ideally where I&apos;d like to go with my career, though I&apos;m not overly picky and could do other areas of accounting. I graduate on May 7 with my BBA in Accounting from Georgia Southwestern. It&apos;s just a four year degree in an area that is increasingly wanting a CPA certification, but I&apos;d like to find entry-level work and then go back to do the M. Acc. and CPA cert later. Down to the actual interview: They called me yesterday to do a kind of &quot;core competency&quot; interview. Basically my interviewer just explained that if you&apos;re the best tax accountant in the world with poor people skills, you&apos;re gonna suck at their company and they don&apos;t want you. All good and well. I do well in interviews, and I did well with this one. He had me walk him through my work history, asking me to give him personal details on why I did the things I did, and then explained a couple of crappy work situations to him and how I resolved them. He seemed apathetic and when I asked, he said he&apos;d talk to their tax director and get back to me on Monday about a second interview. I wasn&apos;t hopeful .About an hour later, I get a phone call from the HR person telling me that I&apos;ve been selected for a second interview with the Tax Director. It&apos;s on Thursday, so I have a week to brush up my stuff. The first interviewer specifically asked if I was familiar with US GAAP and Sarbanes Oxley. I said that of course I&apos;d learned about it in college and was familiar with the concepts. He said nothing else about it, but I&apos;m betting I need to be at the top of my game on that and am going to spend my next week pulling out my old friend Intermediate Accounting and studying. So the question is: Given the job description, what do you think they&apos;re after with GAAP and SOX knowledge? They&apos;re both so widespread that it&apos;s hard to really know specifically what I should be studying up in order to not seem like a dolt to an interviewer. I was always under the impression that they didn&apos;t want you to memorize specific portions of GAAP so much as know the basics and be able to research and find the specifics. Secondly, do you think they&apos;re really interested in me for this position? Like I said, I&apos;m sure there are people who live closer and have more experience related to business tax returns than I do. However, it&apos;s entry-level, so maybe they&apos;re not looking for too much experience, and instead want to train their own person? I&apos;m Ecstatic to be considered but I&apos;m wondering how much hope I should have for this. Craftsman 18V Cordless Sweeper/Hedge Trimmer ($37.99 was $79.99) @ Sears.com

This Deal Has Expired Not Wasting Youth vs. Saving Money 
 Added on : Thursday April 14th 2011 05:40:05 PM Having recently started thinking about the phrase &quot;youth is wasted in the young&quot; I&apos;ve decided to bring a question to the braintrust at FWF. This brings me to my question, while I&apos;m young and have the energy/time/motivation to enjoy life, how much of my financial resources should I put towards fun: (H&amp;B;, travel, some toys like a motorcycle, etc.) versus saving every penny and enjoying the benefits of long term returns in investments. A bit of background on me, 23 years old, single male, bachelor&apos;s degree and stable job making 40k a year in Kentucky (pretty low cost of living) at a very large company with good job security and benefits, no debt, own a car, rent a nice apartment.Currently, I am maxing out my 401k employer match and have about 25k in savings (not including 401k) and put a chunk of my pay away every two weeks simply to keep me from blowing it. Obviously I could go out tomorrow and buy any of the fun things I mentioned above in cash and not have a significant impact to my financial life but I also know how to do interest calculations and see what that savings could be worth in 20 years at a decent rate of return.So, how much money would the FWF crowd spend on things with no tangible return in my position? Or, alternatively would the FWF crowd tell me to just save towards my goals starting today or lastly would you all suggest continuing to squirrel away money indefinitely?

0 % College Loans Weigh Heavier on Graduates - NYT 
 Added on : Tuesday April 12th 2011 10:40:07 AM College Loans Weigh Heavier on Graduates - NYTOutstanding Student loans has surpassed outstanding credit card debt. The article goes on to say that a college education is still worthwhile due to lower unemployment rates for college grads and higher earning potential. However, the comments section is still of individuals who feel that the entire student loan sector is being unfair to borrowers: no bankruptcy discharge, high interest rates, etc.And as with any discussion about loans, wall street and their excesses were commented on as well. I see there is more of a problem with the rising cost of education than with the student loan market. The primarily reason is because a normal student who has yet to complete a degree, doesn&apos;t have a stable job, and with little to no credit history would, in my opinion, be a huge credit risk. To a certain extent this should justify the high interest rates and lack of discharge in bankruptcy. Tuition on the other hand has risen to astronomical proportions due to higher ongoing costs at universities, new construction and infrastructure projects, and bigger demand for a college education.

I don&apos;t know what that means. I&apos;m a law student, not an accountant. If it means what I think it means, it&apos;ll average the rates based on proportions of total amounts under each rate. Since we are at historically low rates, now would be a good time to consolidate, correct? Is there a disadvantage to consolidating?Secondly, I have a ton of Private Loan Debt.

(This one is a Bar Exam loan to cover all the BS that is involved with that. I also used to to clear any remaining CC debt, which got ratejacked to 20%+ in the pre-CARD act days).I know I am an idiot for incurring all of this debt, but in three weeks, I&apos;ll have a law degree. If I somehow find a job (not promising due to the economy), it might even be worth it. I obviously have to consolidate the Private Loans, and Wells Fargo is the only game in town I believe, though they won&apos;t consolidate the Bar Exam Loan with the rest. I was reading the dozens of threads on 0% Credit Cards with 5% CashBack and purchases from the mint. This seems like a good plan to work down some of the debt. Can someone provide a detailed explanation of how this works?Mainly I&apos;m asking for three things:
1. Should I consolidate the FedLoans?
2. Is there any reason not to consolidate the Private Loans, other than losing that lovely 3.2 percent interest rate on one of them?
3. How does the CC/Mint thing work? Logitech N700 Speaker Lapdesk ($44.99 compare at $64.99) @ Logitech

2 years limited Need advice on career path. CFA or MBA? 
 Added on : Friday April 08th 2011 01:40:16 AM I live in SF and I have been working in operational improvement consulting for the past 3 years. Started at one of the Big 4 type firms then moved to a smaller boutique firm. I&apos;d like to move into equity research or portfolio analytics but I haven&apos;t gotten any call backs after applying to many places. I tried submitting my resume via official and unofficial channels. I tried networking as well but none of it has worked out for me (or ever).My degree was not in accounting/finance/econ, it was in Industrial Engineering but from a reputable top 25ish school (US News ranking). I applied to various places and the ONLY places I&apos;ve gotten interviews at are:1. Prop Trading
2. VC Pre-MBA AssociateProp trading is too risky for me. Even if you get hired on, some are let go right after the training period. If you aren&apos;t consistently making money for the firm day in day out, you are let go. The VC role is interesting but most of these type of roles are only for 2-3 years and then kicked out where you are encouraged to either go back for your MBA or do something else. Given that I am on FW, going for my MBA is not something I want to do as it is very costly, but is it my only option? I am going to be fully out of debt this year and I don&apos;t want to be crippled with student loan payments again. $100K+ in loans is too much for me to bear. On my resume, I am stressing my analytical and quantitative background with relevant coursework in finance and economics hoping it gets noticed so I can break into portfolio analytics/equity research. However, I have not gotten one response. I feel quite discouraged and I&apos;m just not sure where my career path is going. I am hoping to leave my current job sometime this year because it&apos;s starting to get unstable. I don&apos;t want to get laid off without anything lined up. I have built an emergency reserve of 4 months in preparation though. I&apos;m thinking these are my options:
1) Aim for a Pre-MBA VC Associate or similar type role, work for 2-3 years and just pay out of my pocket to go for the MBA
2) Continue trying to break into Equity Research/Portfolio Analytics so I don&apos;t waste time or money for any additional schooling (maybe with the exception of CFA)
3) Aim for a consulting or industry position where they have tuition assistance for MBA (part-time or full-time)
4) Other?I&apos;m really conflicted and any advice would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance. Adjustable Tilting/Swiveling Wall Mount Bracket for LCD Plasma (Max 300Lbs, 52~72inch) $70.74 +s/h @ monoprice

23.6&quot; screen measured diagonally from corner to corner Roth IRA investment question and others 
 Added on : Tuesday March 29th 2011 10:40:18 AM Hi there, I am a long time FWF user.I am a 31 year old software professional, yearly income (from salary) $165,000. Married, one kid a year old. Wife does not work because she is on a dependent visa and we are waiting for the green card to be processed and also for the kid to go to school before she starts some work (easily will take 3 years).My job is pretty safe, I have saved a year worth of emergency fund (better safe than sorry, I am kind of paranoid). Have been maxing out my 401k (with 50% company contribution) for a little less than 3 years and it currently has $80,000. Planning to do this until I retire (hopefully 65)Own a condo in north jersey area, mortgage balance $287000 at 5% fixed for 30 years. Plan to live here for at least 5 years for sure (may be more).Following are my questions:
1) I am currently in the process of refinancing at 4% for 15 years with Penfed (o cost). I can afford it as my monthly payment will be $600 more. Is this a good idea considering I will be saving almost $200,000 worth of interest between these 2 mortgage?2) With the little monthly savings I will be left with, I am thinking about opening an IRA (or ROTH IRA) for my wife (to save taxes). Is the a possibility considering the scenario above (income limits and the fact that she does not work)? Is this a good idea?3) Wife has a bachelors degree in automation engineering which she got 3 years ago, no work experience though. Considering she can not work for next couple of years (because of visa/green card issues), the degree will become worthless I believe. She is good at soft skills like planning etc (I guess most women are) and I don&apos;t want her to do any stressful job (like I know technical jobs are mostly stressful). What kind of course we should consider for her to do which has a value everywhere and makes a decent salary (we both are confused at this point). I can support my family from my salary, so I don&apos;t need her to work but I believe going out to work is very important for your confidence and sanity. Sorry if this question is too vague but at this point, any suggestions are welcome.Feel free to ask any details required to answer the questions above.Thanks in advance.

 Added on : Wednesday March 23rd 2011 11:40:20 PM It&apos;s pretty obvious to me that higher education is in a bubble, just like tech in 2000 and the housing market three years ago. Skyrocketing tuition rates, increasing amounts of student debt, along with stagnant wages mean that people will soon be balking at paying $100k for a degree that will earn them $30k a year. I think this is going to mostly affect mid- to lower-ranked private schools (Boston University is a local example that comes to mind). I think schools like this will start to see fewer and fewer admissions over the next 5 years or so. Flagship state universities will see increasing numbers of applications from in-state students such that they&apos;ll have to cap the number admitted (many already do). Second-tier state universities will start to see more applications and will increase capacity in response. &quot;Hard&quot; majors like engineering (maybe finance?) will see increasing numbers of applicants across the board. Trade schools will prosper. I can&apos;t predict how for-profit schools (like University of Phoenix) will figure into this trend, but I believe that they will probably adapt and be successful.There will probably be more cascading effects, but the question is how can one profit from this? Education hasn&apos;t been packaged into a security that I know of other than publicly traded for-profits like U of P. How can you short George Washington University? Does it make sense to anyone else to invest in for-profit colleges? How to profit when the higher education bubble burtst

 Added on : Friday March 18th 2011 03:40:10 AM Hi Everyone, this is my first post hereI recently graduated from a University in California. I had no access to my parental information and thus was unable to fill out fafsa and get federal loans. Long Story.I went to Wells Fargo, a private bank, to get an educational loan.Had no where else to go. The loan amount was $25,000 and the interest rate is 10.74%. So far, the interest I owe is $5200. I will be going BACK to graduate nursing school this summer and THIS TIME i will get a financial aid package and subsidized loans etc thankfully.Any suggestions on how to try and fix my interest rate on my undergraduate degree? Loan consolidation with another lender? I am 23, male, no dependants, have made a collective 25k over the past 3yrs as a student, so no substantial income or assets.I am quite lost to be honest. Not sure how to tackle this loan because it is collecting interest as we speak and will continue to do so when I enter my graduate nursing program (Starts in June and ends in 15months) I would appreciate ANY HELP and advice Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black $34.99 fs @ amazon

 Added on : Thursday March 17th 2011 02:40:05 AM So:My gf and I are thinking of quitting our careers in the States to live abroad for awhile and would like to ask for opinions and tips on how to make it over there.Destination: SE Asia.
Duration: 1-2 yearsAbout me: MBA. Industry, healthcare. I don&apos;t think most companies will be able to afford me over there. And I really don&apos;t want to work too hard for a pittance, you know $1000/month for an US educated MBA. Hot GF: Massage Therapist. She&apos;s licensed and degreed and doesn&apos;t give happy endings to anyone except me. So, the skill is definitely not transferable to most establishments in SE Asia.Plan 1: We&apos;re thinking of getting a TESOL certificates so that we can teach. Wages range from $15-20/hr. We figure we can work 3 days a week and have ample $$ left to live and do a little traveling. The TESOL classes cost $1000/each.I&apos;ve heard that it&apos;s a lot easier to find work with a TESOL certificate and you get paid higher. But I&apos;ve also seen people w/o TESOl certificates make good money.Plan 2: I find some something and hopefully make some money. Girlfriend can work at 4-5 star hotel&apos;s spa. But don&apos;t know how much she&apos;ll make.Plan 3: I find odd local stuff and sell it on e-bay, but shipping really kills the deal.I have a bit save up and can live comfortably if we aren&apos;t able to find work over there.We estimated that our living expenses will be about $1000/month. This account for me not going to bars to meet bar girls and not going to those western type establishments. And we&apos;d cook at home 50% of the time.We&apos;ll try to maintain some type of medical insurance.Visa is good on a rolling 6 month. We just leave the country and then come back again.Plans:
A) Get a couple good CCs w/ high credit line.
B) Get together with Citibank and/or HSBC to do banking because they have a local branch over there and you can withdraw money in dollars.
C) Try to get them to pay me in USD b/c local economy is experiencing 12-15% inflation. But USD is losing value too...
D) Get all our medical needs etc done before we leave
E) If we go the teaching route, we&apos;d probably try to get placed before heading over there.Is there anything else we&apos;re missing? Anyone have any alternative plan or recommendation he/she can give me? Shop Rite 3/20-26 OYNO Deals and Ad Scan (ad scan pending)

 Added on : Sunday March 13th 2011 05:44:05 PM This might be a good time to get in on this NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) gas mask especially if you live on the west coast. I&apos;m not joking folks. It&apos;s a great price and has fantastic reviews. I have one and sleep with it right next my bed. I&apos;m sure the U.S. government won&apos;t be handing these out either in case of a nuclear disaster. Only you can protect yourself so don&apos;t depend on Big Brother.Israeli Civilian Gas Mask w/ Nato FilterProduct Description
This is the gas mask issued to Israeli civilians when threatened with chemical attack by Saddam&apos;s Iraq. It has full NBC (neuclear, biological, chemical) protection, and comes with one sealed filter. Mask is new, unissued cond. and has hydration port (comes with drinking straw but not canteen cap) Also good to have around for protection against smoke, paint spray, grinding dust, etc. These are the same masks that some were selling for $200-300 after 9/11. Note; U.S. sales only, no export. Please note that since we have no means of testing, or data from Israeli manufacturer, we cannot guaranty degree of protection, against all possible sources of contamination, or how long filter will last under various conditions (denser contamination means less time). we can only guaranty that mask and filter are in new cond. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002XJ2OU/Some reviews:This is a really good looking, high quality gas mask. It is also VERY comfortable to wear. It comes with nylon straps on the head, and the rubber mask fits great on your face. Wonderful mask! i think the United States should hand these out to us like the Israeli government did for them.It always pays to be prepared for any eventuality. In doing a risk assessment, I discovered that one of the things I was completely unprepared for was an NBC Attack. Or even the more likely eventuality of a major chemical spill or our local nuclear power plant imploding (or exploding...whatever.....it has been known to happen.....Chernobyl...ahem). Anyways, I found this wonderful Israeli Childrens Gas Mask available. Promptly picked up a couple for the kids and tried them out. Who says NBC attacks can&apos;t be fun! The kids thought they were wonderful to play in and then they went outside to try them out in the summer sun and promptly scared the heck out of the neigbours kids. It was worth the price just to see the brat from 2 doors down run away screaming and crying. hehehehehehehe. Can&apos;t speak for their ability to deal with NBC attacks (my wife got a bit antsy when I suggested maybe we use some tear gas on the kids to try out their effectiveness (and get the kids out of the garage - I tried to explain that that was how the Army trained us to use these things effectively back in my day but she didn&apos;t wear that one....). But they do seem to be good for scaring the neighbours kids! Rosewill-Pellucid HD Series High Speed Swivel HDMI Cable with Ethernet (3.3 FEET) $6.99 fs @ newegg

Please also share with us if you find something else ~ How should I handle this hiring situation? 
 Added on : Thursday March 03rd 2011 10:40:05 PM Hi everyone -Right now I work for the state police in my state. (not as a commissioned officer) When I was hired I had to go through an EXTENSIVE background investigation in which a state police officer investigated my life for three weeks.I have been trying to work for my states health and human services department. Well I passed all the testing for the job and all the interviews. I have a college degree, experience, and am qualified for this position.So guess what? The state (in an effort to save money) has outsourced the hiring process and HR staff for health and human services to a private company. (no, I&apos;m not joking. A private company is running the HR show at this state agency)This company is now trying to &quot;screen&quot; me prior to hiring. Apparently I need to PROVE to them that I am a current state employee in good standing. (yes, apparently I need to prove to a third party company that I am a state employee.... so that I can be a state employee. Wonderful. And I thought government was supposed to be full of bureaucratic garbage and private companies were here to solve that.... anyway back on topic) So apparently this private company isn&apos;t authorized to view HR information for state employees at other state agencies.... even though we are all on the same payroll system.So this company has given me a form that I can not believe they were even able to give me with a straight face. Basically I am supposed to give my supervisor this form which asks detailed questions such as &quot;Has this employee been engaged in sexual harassment? If so what are the details?&quot; &quot;Is this employee on corrective action? What are the details?&quot; &quot;How would you rate their performance?&quot; &quot;Would you hire them again?&quot;I can&apos;t imagine ANY private company being willing to fill out this kind of form, (please correct me if I am wrong) and I can&apos;t imagine asking my supervisor to risk her job and/or a lawsuit over it. For all she knows I could be the type that turns around and sues if anything she writes hurts my job. (I&apos;m not, and I&apos;m also not the kind of person who would ask her to go in to such a situation)I also find this even more ridiculous because I AM ALREADY A STATE EMPLOYEE. If I had ever done anything wrong I would not be working for the state right now, and other state agencies DO have an internal process to get state employee HR information without going through a 3rd party company. Unfortunately it seems the legislature in an attempt to cut costs has disrupted this process with health and human services.Am I being unreasonable in refusing to have this filled out? I am on the verge of sending them an email telling them they won&apos;t be getting this form, and if they don&apos;t want to hire me over it so be it.

 Added on : Wednesday March 02nd 2011 07:40:11 PM So here is my situation. I am 28 years old, and Married with one kid (3 years old). I have my Bachelors Degree in Business Management. I am in a sales position, where the majority of my income is based off of a commission. I make (what I consider) good money. Last year, for the first time in my life, I made just a hair over 6 figures, and expect to make a little more this year. I live in a very modest house with a $130K mortgage, and have 2 newer reliable cars that I will probably keep for the next several years. Even though I made $100,000, I worked a LOT of hours...mostly 14 hour days, often 6 days a week. This gives me very little time to spend with my family. The job I am in, I do not really enjoy and does not give me much satisfaction (I love sales, but this is a cublicle desk sales job). I am very good at what I do (I was number one in my state and number 5 in the nation for sales for last year for my company). My question to you that have &quot;made it&quot;...is it really worth it? If I wanted to move up in my company, I would take a severe paycut (about 60%). I have always done sales, and have always been in the top 5% of the companies I worked for (all multi-billion dollar companies). I just hate sitting at a desk all day being tied to the phone, and not being able to spend time with my family. So again, to the &quot;older&quot; fatwalleters...was it worth it now that it is all said and done? Haier 32&quot; Class LED-LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV, HL32LE2 $319 Free Ship to Store

 Added on : Friday February 25th 2011 09:40:20 PM My situation:21 with an accounting degree, employed by large national bank in a management training track on the retail banking side, ~40k annual. My company would be willing to give me a mortgage even without 2 years of income due to my employment. Rates are below market, e.g. currently 4.0% APR 15 year fixed, 3.2% 5/1 ARM for associates. I plan on living in this part of the country for many years, and have just relocated here from where I grew up in the northeast. I am willing to look at a long term investment via homeownership, likely a property in the 90k-100k range. While plans do not always pan out, I am looking at a town home to start. This is in Florida, so no state income tax and the area I am in is still a slightly declining market. I have done my initial research into low-moderate income programs for first time homebuyers. My lease is up at the end of September. While this is partially a buy v. rent, predominantly I am seeking advice on where and how to allocate my cash right now. Liabilities:
$16000 fixed @ 6.8% (6.55% due to auto-debit discount) Federal Student Loans, tax deductible interest.
$23000 fixed @ 4.5% Auto Loan
$5000 @ 0% CC until November
Assets:
$8000 Cash on hand, primarily kept in Internet Savings @ 1.25%
$1250 Roth IRA in Vanguard STAR fund
~$6000 in unrealized long-term capital losses (Please don&apos;t berate, I plan on holding for now since my marginal rate is very low)I will begin having a dollar for dollar immediately vesting match on up to 5% of pay come July for my 401k that I will take advantage of.While I consider myself more financially savvy than most of my peers, I do appreciate the knowledge and insights of those on this forum, and I thank you for your time.

 Added on : Wednesday February 23rd 2011 05:40:07 PM One of my friends is trying to get me into ACN (mainly to sell cell phones and to a lesser degree internet/cable service, and definitely energy once it&apos;s more de-regulated in my area). It&apos;s similar to a pyramid scheme but not really. As in, it&apos;s legal (no one gets any money for someone signing up, only after they become qualified and get some customers) and it rests on risidual income. The buy-in is $500. Apparently it&apos;s endorsed by Trump and is supposed to be on the Apprentice in about a month, but I digress. I&apos;m curious if anyone here has done it, and if so what kind of money you&apos;re making with it now and how much work is required for what kind of return.Basically you&apos;re like a broker for services and products people get already, you can just offer it to them cheaper because you&apos;re taking out the middleman.

WalMart No.: 000506816 Financial Aid for College while owning rental property 
 Added on : Sunday February 13th 2011 12:40:04 PM I am in my mid 30s and have decided to finish up my Bachelors degree. Ive got about one more year left, and I am attending more than full time, with a minimum of 15 credit hours a semester and most of the time more like 18. The problem I am having is with financial aid. My wife is the only one who is working, and last year she only showed about 20K in revenue and we are unable to get any type of financial aid for school.
The problem is that we own rental property. We have 7 houses that are rentals, but none of them bring in a profit. All of the revenue from the houses goes to mortgage payments, property taxes, etc.. Because of these houses I cant get any financial aid for school, and currently I am taking unsubsidized loans to pay for my education. This is fine, and I am willing to take on the debt, but I am wondering if there is any way to be eligible for financial aid if we put these houses in a trust, or a LLC, or any other thing. It seems that as long as these houses are in our name, my financial aid eligibility is zero.
If anyone knows anything about this type of thing, or has any other advise please let me know.Thanks,

 Added on : Saturday February 12th 2011 08:40:24 PM I see quite a bit of student loan information here, but not the answer to this.I have a significant amount of &quot;old&quot; student loans from getting a 2-yr AA degree about 11 years ago. I was not very smart at the time: I borrowed too much, then consolidated at an interest rate of about 7.5%. I&apos;ve been paying regularly ever since, but there&apos;s still a large balance. They are about half subsidized, and half unsubsidized. I hate those student loans and the bad interest rate. Every other loan in our portfolio is under 5%. I&apos;ve been mostly working my part-time low-paying job and raising our young children the last 10 years, but they&apos;re both going to be in school all day next fall. I&apos;m reentering college this spring to complete a four year degree in a sensible and potentially high earning field. Well, much better wages than I can expect to earn in my current field anyhow. I&apos;m attending an inexpensive in-state university, and I&apos;ll be able to pay for tuition, books, and fees with gift aid and out of pocket money.I&apos;ve been seriously considering taking out &quot;new&quot; loans to pay off the &quot;old&quot; loans. I would only borrow subsidized dollars, and I would put every penny into paying back the old loans. At the very least, I should be able to convert the unsubsidized portion of the old loans (currently at 7.5%) into new subsidized loans (expected rate range 4.5-6.8% over the next two years of my education). If I&apos;m lucky, I might be able to pay off the old loans in their entirety, completely replacing them with &quot;new&quot; money at 4.5-6.8% It would be a semi-slow process, but I could keep at it every semester. I&apos;d feel a whole lot better if I ended up with a 4-year degree, and the total loan amount is still the same but at a lower interest rate. Am I missing anything important here? Any reason why this would be a bad idea? Receive $10 Gift Card w/ purchase of $25 T-Fal Griddle, 5qt Cooker, Enamel Saute Pan, 12&quot; or 14&quot; Fry Pan at Boscov&apos;s

This Deal Has Expired Job hopping in this economy 
 Added on : Thursday February 03rd 2011 07:40:09 PM My job is really relax and laid back, my co-workers are cool, but the pay has remain stagnant for a while now. I am thinking about job hopping. The other day, I saw a position posted which could possibly pay 10-20K more if I land it. I am very well suited for the posting and given my own company&apos;s difficulty in trying to find someone with a similar skillset, I think I do have a real good chance at landing it. The flip side is the economy is still in the dumps and job hopping always involves some degree of uncertainty. So what does the FWF community think?

Bachelor degree BIS 2011(April)-Done with everything just need to wait until graduationJobTeam Lead/Project Lead working for a small tech consulting company on site at a large sports company. I love working at the place, but my company is not the greatest.I was hired and we took over 8 months ago from another group that was not doing what the client wanted. I manage the IT help desk at this location and there are 5 of us. Since I have been here we have implemented a new ticketing system and taken on some new roles that the other company did not do.Current Salary 45000 + 2k bonus based on performanceperformance is based on e-mails sent to users and they provide feedback via a form. I currently am at 100% positive and as a group we are 98%How do I ask for a raise or even should I?
How should I approach it?I know one of my employees asked for a raise about 3 months ago and got told. Everyone is expendable and he has things working against him. He currently makes 10k less than I do.

1. Have degrees
2. Worked in IT for 5 years Learning the value of hard work 
 Added on : Saturday January 29th 2011 08:40:04 AM I graduated from Yale last Spring with a degree in East Asian Studies.
All my life, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I even took a Constitutional Law course taught by Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar and really enjoyed it.But I had the fortune of taking more law courses while an undergrad, and realized that casebooks and statutes are tediously boring.So I didn&apos;t go to law school.I thought I would be a paralegal doing discovery for a major tech company, but the company itself warned me that the job would be mind-numbingly boring.
I thought I would be a management consultant for a top consulting firm, but I bombed the interview (and realized that maybe consulting wasn&apos;t for me).So I&apos;ve been mostly sitting at home reading business books (Millionaire Next Door, etc.), scared that I would pick the &quot;wrong&quot; career. I spent a lot of time knowing myself better and figuring out my flaws.I read this article:
What are you going to do with that?[L=http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/12465... said: http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/]From[/L] the time you started high school and maybe even junior high, your whole goal was to get into the best college you could, and so now you naturally think about your life in terms of &quot;getting into&quot; whatever&apos;s next. &quot;Getting into&quot; is validation; &quot;getting into&quot; is victory. Stanford, then Johns Hopkins medical school, then a residency at the University of San Francisco, and so forth. Or Michigan Law School, or Goldman Sachs, or McKinsey, or whatever. You take it one step at a time, and the next step always seems to be inevitable.I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t get a job right after school. All my life, I did things because it was what I was &quot;supposed&quot; to do.
I realize that schools like Yale prepare you for certain types of careers -- law, finance, etc. -- none of which I want to do.Whatever I do, it will involve hard work, doing something I want to do (as opposed to &quot;going with the flow&quot; and doing what an Ivy League grad is &quot;supposed&quot; to do).So now, I&apos;m going to fulfill my dream of enlisting in the Marine Corps as a reservist (mechanical infantry). I hope to learn the value of hard work and getting along with people who are different than me. I know I&apos;ve been spoiled, and I should fix it before trying to start a career. In fact, my parents never wanted me to get a job in high school because they wanted me to focus on studying.All my life, I thought of things in terms of &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because the test was easy,&quot; or &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because I&apos;m smart.&quot;
But never &quot;I got an &apos;A&apos; because I worked hard for it.&quot;My question: How did you learn the value of hard work? LG 42LD550 42&quot; LCD 1080p HDTV w/ LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi Adapter $599.99

 Added on : Thursday January 27th 2011 06:40:04 PM I work at a consulting company (roughly 200 employees in the North America office) and I finished my project less than 2 weeks ago.
Two weeks on the &quot;bench&quot; is not that bad in terms of billability. Certainly not atypical. 2-3 months on the bench then it starts getting risky. I was contacted about a project that they put me on without my knowledge but I have zero interest in being part of it and I&apos;m not even in the same practice area.
It&apos;s a testing role. They have people who can do testing and have a dedicated practice area. I have no experience with it nor have any interest in it. Definitely not in my career direction. I talked to the partner at my firm and brought up some of these points. He said he will swap me out but he didn&apos;t sound happy since the firm is facing some billability issues meaning not enough projects going on to get all available resources staffed .
I am happy to take roles to help bring in revenue for the firm but what if I have zero interest, no skills are transferable, and no career benefits stuck doing testing? If I took the role, I will be stuck doing that 6+ months (the project will last longer than that). My background is: 3 years of previous consulting work experience and master&apos;s degree from a top 10 engineering school. For now, I am going to be applying to new jobs as this company is not really where I want to be. Those who have experience at global consulting companies, your advice will be very welcome as I am a little nervous about what happened and don&apos;t want to lose my job without another lined up. 4 LED 360 Rotatable Lamp Clip $0.99 ac / shipped @ meritline / starts 5am pst!

 Added on : Sunday January 16th 2011 09:40:03 PM I am wondering if I have a chance of getting a federal job or if anyone has any experience in this regard?Basically I am 26 years old. I have a good work history overall. After I graduated high school I went to work at Target and ended up being promoted twice and ended up in management as a team leader. I stayed there for 4 years.I then went to work for AT&amp;T;as an installation and repair technician. Did that for a few months before deciding I hated it and quit.After that I went to work for the state, and I&apos;ve been an administrative assistant at a state police office ever since. I had to pass a thorough background check in order to work for the state police, and suffice to say I have good credit and no problems in my past. I&apos;ve found I really enjoy public sector work. I want to continue a career in public service, but I would like to work for the federal government in some capacity.As far as education goes I have a high school diploma. I also have two information technology certifications - an A+ and MCP/MCDST certification. (though I don&apos;t want to work in IT again)Last month I completed my associates degree in liberal arts at our local community college. (this degree knocks out the first two years of a bachelors degree when transferred to a state university) In total I have earned 70 college credits.I have started this month on my first classes at a state university to earn a bachelors of science degree in criminal justice. (I am doing all this while working full time for the state) I need to complete 54 more college credits in order to earn my bachelors degree. So I anticipate completion by the year 2013.My question is do I stand a chance of getting an entry level federal job before completing my bachelors degree? Or will I likely have to finish that degree before standing a chance? Samsung HMX-E10 1080P Pocket Camcorder w/270-Degree Swivel Lens (Black) $72.28 Shipped @ Amazon

 Added on : Thursday January 13th 2011 12:40:06 PM 6 months ago I purchased a 1999 Buick Regal with 80k miles on it. The 3.8 V6 Series II engine is supposedly
really good so I hope the car lasts at least 5 more years. I drive only 5k miles per year.In late November, when the weather was getting cold, I noticed that the car would not start easily.
I would have to crank the ignition several times before the engine would start and keep running.
On warmer days this way not an issue. The cold weather (about 20 or 30 degrees) was partly to blame.I figured the problem was not so much with the battery, since the accessories worked and the engine would crank,
it just wouldn&apos;t start. Therefore the problem is probably due to: starter, spark plugs, bad fuel pump, or alternator.
I don&apos;t know which one it is though.Anyway, before I could get this fixed, I had to go overseas for nearly a month to visit family for the holidays.
The day before I left, I drove the car for a solid hour on the highway so that the battery would have a good charge
before sitting for a month.Well today I get back and try to start the car. The lights and radio work, and the engine cranks but only for a second
and stops. I tried 4 times to start the engine but the cranking was weak and the engine would not start.
The car is 12 years old and the battery is about 5 years old, so I&apos;m not surprised this is happening.So I figure now I have to jump start the battery. My car is parked in the street so I can&apos;t use a battery charger
for lack of an electrical outlet. In addition to jump start the battery and get it running again, I have to fix either
the starter or spark plugs or fuel pump. I figure with my old car I might as well join AAA since I&apos;ll probably need their services a couple times a year. I already
need them to jump start my car. I might be able to get roadside assistance for cheap if I add it to my car insurance with
Progressive, but I&apos;m going to have to find out whether they report it to CLUE or not. If they don&apos;t, then I certainly don&apos;t
want to spend $70 on AAA.Do you think this is the best way forward? Join AAA to jump start car as well as provide peace of mind for an old car that
probably will have problems at least once a year, then go test starter, alternator, and battery at Autozone. (I hear Autozone will test all those things at no charge. I hope they won&apos;t say everything is bad just so that I buy new parts from them) Pep Boys FREE Brake Inspection (reg 9.99) - Coupon

 Added on : Tuesday January 11th 2011 12:40:06 AM If one is an engineer, what is the best way to avoid becoming pigeon holed from specializing in a very specific skill? For example designing compressor blades on a jet engine--pretty much the only job you could do after 10 years of this is designing compressor blades on some other turbine-based power system. My degree is ME and I&apos;m thinking of going back to the field but I worry about the tendency of specialization for engineers versus financial analysts or accountants or even IT professionals.

Condition: New Product: 1 Sanyo VPC-GH2 14MP HD 1080 Camcorder/Camera -BlackWarranty: Sanyo 90 Day Parts / 1 Year LaborCondition: NewFeatures:Records in full HD 60i video and up to 14 megapixel digital photos
12X dual range zoom for video and 5X optical zoom for photos
Designed to fit in the palm of your hand, the compact and lightweight design makes it extremely portable and easy to use
Recording videos, shooting photos and accessing settings in the menu can easily be controlled with your thumb
MPEG4/H.264 recording format makes it a breeze to share videos and photos via social networking Web sites, portable video devices like iPods, TVs and computers
Easy to navigate menu makes it a great choice for the beginner and the more advanced user
Large 2.7-inch LCD display flips out from the camera and rotates up to 285 degrees
Sequential photo shooting mode will take multiple photos in order; perfect for action photography
Photo image stabilizer actually takes two photos at the same time (one at a faster shutter speed and one at a slower one), them combines the benefits of both resulting in an image that has less blur and less noise
Video stabilizer automatically compensates for up-and-down and side-to-side camera movement by accurately distinguishing between unintentional camera shake and deliberate camera movement; operates in both wide-angle and telephoto modes
Video and photo face detection recognizes multiple subjects faces and optimizes focus/aperture settings to ensure each individual is in focus
Eye-Fi wireless SD card is automatically recognized when inserted; on camera smart power allows the camera to control the Eye-Fi function and provide power management, automatically shutting the card off when not in use
Windows 7 compatible, video files are displayed in the same thumbnail format as still picture files and can be played back directly with Windows Media Player, edited with Windows Live Movie Maker, and are Device Stage compatible
Object chaser technology allows you to maintain proper lighting and focus on objects in motion
The mini-HDMI output makes connecting the camera to a digital TV or DVD recorder a breeze for quick and easy playback; still images and video clips are played back continuously and in chronological order
Can also easily be connected to a computer to back-up copies of recorded content via the handy USB 2.0 connection; simple drag-and-drop operation makes it easy to save recorded video clips and still images onto a computers hard disk for emailing, editing or archiving
High-capacity Sanyo brand lithium-ion battery delivers approximately 70 minutes of video record time and resists memory accumulation so it provides a full charge every time
While this camera 2 works with standard SD memory, and more high capacity SDHC memory cards, it is also fully compatible with the next generation SDXC memory cards; also capable of playing Full HD 1080 videos stored on SDXC cards on your high definition TV
Highly advanced MPEG4 AVC/H.264 video compression optimizes the file size and makes sharing movies on social networking sites, or emailing them to friends and family, even easier. In fact, the file size can be up to 25 percent smaller than that of typical MPEG-4 cameras. A dedicated H.264 video compression IC was incorporated into the camera that was designed specifically for portable consumer devices. This achieves high video quality while simultaneously reducing the system power consumption
Capture still images while youre shooting video with a simple press of the shutter button. (Depending on the mode used to take still images, simultaneous video clip shooting may be interrupted. While shooting video clips, using the digital image stabilizer may change the angle of view for still images.)
Super-fast start up reduces your chance of missing the perfect shot; the tapeless design eliminates the need to queue up a video tape, allowing it to begin shooting in as little as 1.7 seconds

Enjoy a superior HD experience with the HDMI one-cable solution PT Jobs for FT Students 
 Added on : Tuesday January 04th 2011 07:40:05 PM My wife is quitting her FT job with the state Dept of Family Services so that she can start a full-time Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification program. (i.e. Undergrad classes resulting in no degree, but which meet requirements for teacher certification.) She is enrolled in a &quot;traditional&quot; teaching program rather than an Alternative Certification (which see sees as &quot;less employable&quot; in a long-term teaching career), so we expect about 18 months without her income. After graduating, it is reasonable to expect she will find work as a teacher and make about $10K more than she did with the state.She has been looking for a PT job, but has not had much luck finding nanny or babysitting jobs, which is what she used to do in college.So, 2 questions:1. Where would you recommend looking for PT jobs that are student-friendly.
2. Does anyone have experience with some of the traditional PT student jobs, and can give pros/cons of those employers? Starbucks? Tutors.com? I need a financial plan. Please help. 
 Added on : Sunday January 02nd 2011 04:40:04 PM I am 25 years old. I graduated with my masters degree recently - and have had a job for about a year. I was making 70k/yr and recently got a raise to 95k/yr. My job is very stable - and I&apos;m fortunate enough to be in a field where if something happened I could find another job without a problem, probably making more (but I love where I&apos;m at now). I had around 70k in student loan debt, which I&apos;ve paid down to around 50. The monthly payment on that money is $500/month. However, I&apos;m so far paid ahead due to making extra payments, if I didn&apos;t pay anything untill mid-2012, I wouldn&apos;t go delinquent. The monthly payments come directly out of my checking account, and I&apos;ve been sending in extra on top of that whenever I can. The monthly amount I would owe is around 550 dollars. I also have a car payment (at 0% interest) of 603 dollars per month. I&apos;ve got a cell phone bill that costs me 40 dollars a month, and a cable bill that costs me 20 dollars a month. I spend, on average, 50 dollars a week on gas. My insurance (full coverage) is 60 dollars a month. So, my absolutely minimum ammount I owe per month is 1271.75. However, if I couldn&apos;t work for a year for some strange reason and couldn&apos;t pay my loans for a year, they would not go into default and I would only be obligated to pay $721.75. I&apos;m also saving 5% of my income in a 401k, I have an employer match of 3% and a cash balance pension contribution by my employer of 3% - for a total of 11% savings into retirement per year. I&apos;m comfortable with that amount for now.I&apos;m estimating my monthly income, after taxes, health care etc. will be 5500-6500 a month when I get my first post-raise paycheck. I&apos;m guessing 5500 to be conservative.So now what? I live with my parents. I was planning on moving out once I got my degree/raise to ensure things were more stable. I&apos;ve decided if I allow myself 200 dollars a week for other expenses (food, entertainment, clothing, etc.) I can save up 40k in a year. I&apos;ve already got around 6k in savings (I had been putting all my extra money into my student loans/car/car down payment). My car is at 0% interest, so I&apos;m really not interested in paying that back any sooner - and I&apos;ve got gap insurance and new car replacement if it&apos;s totalled for 2 years.So - I can save up 40k per year if I continue to live at home. I&apos;ve priced apartments - and can get into something for around 1k/month. Adding food (75 dollars a week), utilities (250 per month to be conservative, internet (which I need for work) 75 dollars a month - I would be adding 1650 in expenses per month, or around 20k. So I would then be able to save approximately 20k per year.I&apos;m new to all of this, so I&apos;m sorry if this sounds dumb, I just don&apos;t know what to do. I would really like to move out. But I don&apos;t know if I want to move into an apartment. The interest rates/prices on homes are so low right now, and I would like to take advantage of it. From people I&apos;ve talked to, I don&apos;t see things changing within the next couple of years. So if I could save up for a year and a half, and continue to live at home, I would have a healthy down payment and an emergency fund to buy a house. But then I have to live at home for another year and a half.I&apos;m just confused because I don&apos;t know how people do these things. Am I thinking correctly? Am I forgetting something? What is the prudent financial decision to make? I know there are some who say - pay off all of your debt before you do anything. I could pay off my car and student loans in about 2 years. However, the car is at 0% interest, and I&apos;ve taken a huge chunk out of my student loans and do plan on putting any extra into those. The interest rate on my student loans varies between 2.5-6.8, however I&apos;ve mostly paid off the 6.8% loans. I&apos;m ok with paying those out for the next several years with my &quot;minimum&quot; payments. I can afford to do that I believe. I&apos;m getting stir crazy. I want to get out of my parents house. I moved out for undergraduate, but have been here for almost 3 years now while I completed graduate school. I&apos;m scared to get an apartment because I feel like I&quot;m just throwing money away I could be saving for a house to take advantage of the market and get something nice for a reasonable payment. I&apos;m used to being a poor college student and not spending anything (my loans were high - but that was undergraduate and masters sequentially, so around 10k per year to pay tuition, room and board, etc.). I worked in college. I just am so nervous to make a commitment to anything. I love my car, but it took months to decide to do that (while my old car was falling apart) and I still feel guilty about doing that. I researched that to death. I&apos;m commitment phobic.I&apos;ve been reading these forums for a long time, and I know i just created this account and am now begging for help/advice. However, I don&apos;t know much about money (I watch Suze Orman and sometimes listen to Dave Ramsay) but I had nothing valuable to contribute to posts because I&apos;m not experienced. So, sorry this is my first post.So I don&apos;t know what to do. I don&apos;t know what to do with my money. I don&apos;t like living with my parents. I feel like a loser. They refuse to charge me rent because they&apos;re trying to help me out. Am I missing something in my logic? Should i just get an apartment? How do people figure these things out? I feel overwhelmed and terrified... 2 Way Adjustable Tilting Desk Mount Bracket for LCD (Max 33Lbs, 10~25inch) - Black $12.27 + s/h @ monoprice

**PLEASE CHECK SPECIFICATIONS TAB FOR ADDITIONAL COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION! Convince or dissuade my parents from investing in my brother&apos;s business? 
 Added on : Friday December 31st 2010 02:40:04 PM This post is to vent and also to see other people&apos;s opinion.My brother wants to open up a very expensive franchise restaurant. He doesn&apos;t have the requisite asset(1-2 mil) so he would like my parents and I to invest.Here are the cons:
He&apos;s a screwup. I love him but he&apos;s still a screwup. He has had a string of failed small business(no where near as capital intensive) that have all been funded by my parents and in fact his living expenses are still all paid by them. He has zero restaurant experience other than working part time in taco bell in high school for a few month to put on his college application. His college degree is a useless liberal arts degree that took 8 years to obtain because of his partying. He always desires the luxurious things in life. He&apos;s been recently looking to buy a new audi s5 for god&apos;s sake while I&apos;m driving an accord.My parents want to retire soon but probably won&apos;t with this amount of cash at risk. My father is very conservative financially and even though he probably can retire even with this investment, he won&apos;t be able to sleep unless there&apos;s a significant amount of cushion. My father&apos;s dream is to travel the world and he&apos;ll have to put that dream on hold with this for several years. If they do go along with this, I&apos;ll be contributing nearly all my liquid asset to lessen their burden which will probably amount to 1/3 of the investment. I won&apos;t be able to start investing in real estate for a while.Here are the pros:
It&apos;s a very safe franchise with an outstanding record for return. Brand recognition is incredible. Corporate is very strict about nearly everything and lack of experience would not be fatal. I&apos;m 90% sure this will succeed because of the franchise track record. I&apos;ll be active in managing this restaurant as well. I&apos;m not very worried about contributing this much cash because I spend significantly less than the income from my job and saving will accumulate quickly. I just turned 30 and am single without any obligation. If it does succeed, it&apos;ll provide additional retirement income to my parents. I&apos;ll also have a nice supplemental income. My brother(who recently got married and now has a daughter) will finally be able to be somewhat financially independent from my parents although not really. My mom&apos;s dream is to see all her children succeed and this will help achieve her dream.To prevent this from post from depicting me as the perfect son, I&apos;m not. Everything I&apos;ve accomplished was because of them but I fight with them ALL THE TIME. We constantly argue and fight about inane things although never about money. This might be my first real fight with them about money. OXO Good Grips 15-Piece Everyday Kitchen Tool Set $49.95 @ Amazon

*Note: Code is one time use onlyOnce intended as a feature for Johnny Depp, the long-germinating feature film adaptation of Marvel Comics&apos; cult title Ghost Rider stars Nicolas Cage as motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who transforms into a skull-faced angel of vengeance to battle the forces of evil. Though perhaps a bit too mature for the role, Cage brings a degree of humor to the outrageous proceedings; he&apos;s well matched by the Easy Rider himself Peter Fonda, amusingly cast as Mephistopheles, the demon with whom Blaze strikes a bargain to save his father, and in turn, causes his transformation into Ghost Rider. Wes Bentley is also fine as Blackheart, the rebellious offspring of Mephistopheles, and Blazes&apos; chief opponent in the film. They&apos;re joined by a solid supporting cast which includes Donal Logue, Eva Mendes, and Sam Elliott, but their participation and a relentless barrage of CGI effects can&apos;t hide the fact that the story itself, though largely faithful to its comic origins, is rife with clichd characterizations and glum B-movie dialogue. Fans of the venerable title may cry foul over this adaptation (as they did over helmer Mark Steven Johnson&apos;s previous comic-to-movie feature, Daredevil), but less stringent viewers may enjoy the fiery visuals and Cage&apos;s typically quirky performance. --Paul Gaita

 Added on : Tuesday December 28th 2010 12:40:04 PM Greetings and Happy Holidays to All! It&apos;s time to start the 2010 Career Thoughts and Compensation Thread. I started doing these threads annually on the FW Finance board in 2006. When I originally started this thread four years ago, I thought it could serve as a great resource for people to learn about the ups and downs of various careers, including information such as salaries and benefits. I have always found these threads particularly informative and interesting.I thought last year&apos;s thread was probably the best of all of them. Lots of people contributed information about their careers, and the thread remained active until May. The 2008 thread was a bit of a disappointment, but things got better last year, so let&apos;s try it again!Now gang, here&apos;s a reminder of the rules, which 99.9% of you have been great at following over the past four years:If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2010? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:
Gender: MaleAge: 38Location: Northern NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2010 Salary: $90,000 (Base Pay + Retro Pay from a newly settled contract + a little extra money from some after school work and a few other extra things.) Base pay for the 2010-2011 school year, without extra money, is just about $88,000. Future Salary Projection: This is a tricky one this year. There is a strong possibility that my salary (and the salaries of many other teachers) will be frozen for at least the next year. If salaries are not frozen, my salary should be in the $95,000 ballpark for the 2011 calendar year, and in the $100,000 range for the 2011-2012 school year. (More on why our salaries may be frozen later in the thread.)Benefits: Full medical, modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (for now, more on that later), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) In almost all districts in NJ, you can accumulate sick time from year to year. This is a tremendous benefit, as I found out two years ago, and again just a few weeks ago when I suffered two major long-term illnesses. It was nice not having to worry about getting paid during my absences. What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult and getting more difficult bu the year. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching. Massive budget cuts have made the job even more difficult. Many teachers (myself included) are now finding themselves doing two jobs for the price of one due to massive retirements and staffing cuts. Would you recommend the career to others?Every year, it&apos;s become harder and harder for me to recommend teaching as a career. If you get a job in a district that treats you with some respect, is on solid financial footing (along with your corresponding state), and pays you a salary that ensures you won&apos;t be eating cans of tuna for the rest of your life, then I can recommend teaching as a career.However, things here in NJ have gotten real rough over the past year. Our governor has pretty much made it his mission to make things much rougher for teachers, and has publicly vilified us on many occasions. He reduced state aid for all districts, resulting in massive layoffs. He wants to drastically alter our pension system, and there is a lot of fear that he is going to try to significantly reduce pension benefits for all public employees. This resulted in massive retirements of veteran teachers. He put tremendous pressure on teachers at the end of the last school year to accept salary freezes, even in districts that had valid contracts, and he is likely to increase the pressure this year. He wants to eliminate tenure, and while total elimination is unlikely, it&apos;s likely going to be made much tougher to get and to retain. He wants to institute merit pay, basing teacher salaries on their students&apos; performance on standardized tests. This, of course, is infuriating many teachers, but especially those in urban districts like mine, where teachers sometimes get kids who have never attended school a day in their life show up to begin their educational careers on the day the standardized test starts. How is the kid going to pass the test if he doesn&apos;t even know his alphabet, let alone how to read? How is this kid going to compare to the kid in the affluent district who has a private tutor?Then of course, you have to deal with all of the discipline problems, especially . What do you do when a kid curses you out, flips a desk over, smacks another kid in the head without provocation, and runs out of your class? You could tell your building administrators, but chances are they will not impose serious consequences on the student. They don&apos;t want to make the school look bad or deal with angry parents. Then, if you have administrators who are unsupportive, they may ask you, What did you do to make the kid curse you out, flip over a desk, and smack another student in the head? Then they&apos;ll tell you to better motivate your students to learn. When you ask how, they won&apos;t tell you. (Yes, this stuff actually happens.) There are great moments, however. There are a lot of great kids in all districts who will give you their all every day. This is what keeps me going in my district. I know that I&apos;m helping these kids to have the best future possible, even though they often face difficult circumstances.Teaching is not an easy job, especially in an urban district. If you think that you will be able to face the challenges that await you, then go for it! Just be aware that it&apos;s going to be a bumpy ride.

Checked reviews at Amazon and looks pretty decent. going on Educational Leave of Absence .. questions regarding insurance 
 Added on : Tuesday December 21st 2010 07:40:04 PM I have already cleared any paid time off and will be finishing off a doctoral degree in engineering during the 2 year time frame. I basically have research left, any classes I take are for my own enrichmwnt.My question falls on insurance for next year. I will be undetgoing eye surgery at the end of the year, which is the main reason insurance is important. Currently Iam in benefits correction period until Dec 31. I live in NH, work and go to school in MA. My school has a form to enroll in insurance... it claims that a change in job is a qualified event (i will have a graduate stipend, not sure if that counts) , but it also mentions declining COBRA or a health plan is an unqualified event. If unqualified, they claim that they will only provide 6 months of emergency care at policy start. School insurance is $1.5k til Aug 31st.
Work insurance per year (employee and employer cost together is 4.6k, employee cost is 1.5k)There is a possibility that school insurance is covered by my teaching assistanceship, but not totally sure yet, need to find out details.I haven&apos;t looked into buying insurance on my own, is that even an option given the scenario? Would appreciate anyone knowledgeable to respond with some advice as far as what option would make the most sense.

 Added on : Monday December 20th 2010 07:40:02 PM Sorry to bring drama and write a novel but my family is crazy and I desperately need some financial \ family advice. This is a bit long winded so let&apos;s get right to the situation: Me: 27 year old MBA student living in the Midwest. I have a house I put 20% down on with a 15 year mortgage. No problems paying any of my bills, decent paying 55k job, decent savings rate (around 25K). Mom: Crazy, bipolar, living off social security disability. Absolute financial wreck. Mom&apos;s money is blown in the stupidest ways you can possibly image.
She is 55 years old and doesn&apos;t have a single asset to show for her entire life. She weights 280 pounds, has diabetes, smokes a lot... etc. I honestly don&apos;t think she&apos;ll live much longer but what do I know. She often pays &quot;friends&quot; to drive her places to buy cigarettes. She often hands people to money in order to buy their attention. Lots of people line up to get money out of her. It&apos;s quite pathetic. She has a criminal record. I can&apos;t even share the details because honestly I don&apos;t even know. My mom has a victim mentality and all of her problems are caused by someone else. I know she has been charged for writing in prescriptions (changing 1 refills to a 4), breaking a window at a hotel, assault and battery, etc. my mom has also taken out credit cards in my social security number and ran them up... something that took me years to resolve. I suspect she has drug problems as well. She has a physicians desk reference and often looks up drugs. She uses multiple doctors so I believe she doctor shops to get as much as possible ... I.E. Doctor A doesn&apos;t know what Doctor B is prescribing her. She&apos;s not a completely stupid person as she holds a master&apos;s degree in psychology. She has been evicted from 4 different apartments that I know of and recently moved in with my grandma. My mom is a filthy person and is destroying my great grandparent&apos;s home. Grandmother: 79 years old, nice lady who has enabled my mom&apos;s reckless behavior her entire life. She bailed her out of jail on multiple occessions. In 2009 my great grandmother passed away, who was helping split the bills on a 2400 sq foot 4 bedroom house. Now that she is gone my grandmother is struggling to make ends meet and has losing her will to live.Her health wasn&apos;t that bad even 2 months ago but now she isn&apos;t taking care of herself. I believe my grandma is ashamed that she can&apos;t pay her credit cards and depressed she has to live with my crazy mom. She literally just wants to die and barely eats anything. I have taken her out for meals but she has completely lost her will to live and her plan to get out of the situation is to just die off. I&apos;ve had about 20 conversations with grandma and they are all deva vu. I tell her she needs to kick my mom out and start eating food but of course she won&apos;t listen to me. 
I have advised her to stop paying all credit cards which she has done. Credit is not trashed. She has a 2004 car in mint condition with 20,000 miles on it that she can&apos;t afford to make the payments on. It was going to get repossessed so I am going to pay off the $2,000 balance as a Christmas present. I feel obligated to do this because my grandma paid my way for me to get through college and made sure I had transportation.My grandma has not been paying the income taxes for her house since June 2010 (it&apos;s due every quarter). I could bail her out as it&apos;s only $800 but I don&apos;t want to further enable my Mom&apos;s crazy\bad behavior. The house is worth something like $100k but it hasn&apos;t been maintained (furnace is like 50 years old!!).
My mom is sadly a lost cause. I spent years trying to help her. I was able to get her a $300 government subsidized apartment that was BRAND new in 2006. She was set but she got in fights with the people living in the community and got kicked out and arrested.My idea is to sell my grandma&apos;s car for $8,000 and use the money to pay the property taxes. I don&apos;t think my grandma will be driving anymore or maintaining the car sadly. My mom claims to earn $22,000 a year but it all gets pissed away. My grandma has $1,400. Their water and cable was recently shut off but they got it turned back on.
I guess my questions are:1) Should I try to find psychological help for my grandma? If so how should I approach it. She is obviously depressed. My grandma&apos;s plan is to just die off and let the state take the $100k house back at auction. She actually thinks that&apos;s the best outcome. This will result in my grandma and mom being homeless obviously and a $100k house going to waste.2) Should I get involved in the house\property taxes and if so under what conditions? Obviously if it goes into foreclosure my grandma and mom will be homeless. 3) Is selling my grandma&apos;s car to pay the property tax a good idea? I have access to her checking account. Should I try to take over her finances? 4) Any other advice people can kindly offer? It would be greatly appreciated. I will keep this thread updated and answer and follow up questions. another career salary/career level question 
 Added on : Monday December 20th 2010 01:40:02 PM Hi guys,I was looking at some internal resumes here at my workplace and there are people who on-boarded at a higher level than me and I have my master&apos;s degree. Some of them even graduated with a B.S. one year after me. I guess that goes to show the culture of this company and how they don&apos;t value educational credentials at all. Anyway, I will be jumping to another company who puts more value in this determine salary level and who gets interviewed. Oh well, that&apos;s something else that I won&apos;t discuss here.The question is, as long as I&apos;m satisfied with what I am making when taking into account how many years of work experience I have, is that the only thing that truly matters? Even though I might have come in at a lower level, I feel that my salary is competitive with what people are making in at the next level. How important is the job level?

 Added on : Sunday December 05th 2010 06:40:18 AM Nissan has a very good lease deal on the 2011 Sentra S for December.The interest rate is really low at 1.06% and the residual is really great at 64% for 3YR/36K. Additionally there is a $2500 incentive on the car. All these go into making an excellent lease on this car.Also if you are a recent college grad there is an additional $500 incentive
The text is as follows
&quot; College Grad Bonus Cash available towards leasing or purchases to customers who have graduated within the past 2 years or will do so within the next 6 months from an accredited 2-year College, 4-year College/University, Nursing degree program, or Graduate degree program. Customer must finance or lease through NMAC. See participating dealer for details.&quot;As always, I am not advocating leasing over buying or vice versa neither am I advocating this car over any other. We all have our preferences and if leasing this car is for you, I hope you find the following information useful.2011 Sentra S
36-month | 12k miles | residual 64% | .00044 base money factor
A Sample lease on a base car is as followsMSRP: $18,200
(Target) Selling Price $13780 ( Ive used the truecar.com dealer quote for this and this price is after the $2500 incentive)Drive off: First Month Payment + ~$50 doc fee + DMV fee + SalesTax on $2500incentive. This is essentially a zero down lease
Monthly Payment for 3yr/36K miles: $87 + taxIf you also qualify for the recent College Grad incentive, the lease payment falls to $73/month + tax

 Added on : Thursday December 02nd 2010 01:40:02 AM I&apos;m looking to take a long weekend trip (say Thurs - Sun) somewhere in the U.S. in mid-July of next year. What places have cooler weather during that time of the year? I live in Texas and the heat here gets near 104 degrees during that time of the year and I really want to go somewhere cooler, but someplace that has touristy things to do. I&apos;ve never been to N.Y. or Boston - is the weather nice in either of those places during that time of the year? I&apos;ve been to Seattle and D.C. and not interested in going to either of those.

Amazon.com Product Description The BassLink line includes everything you need for great bass in your car, with no hassle. This system includes a round 10-inch woofer, a round 10-inch passive radiator and a 200-watt Class D amplifier, plus all the controls you need to integrate its sound with your existing system. It can be mounted vertically or horizontally for easy placement in any car.Everything you need for great bass in your car, with no hassle. Click to enlarge.Remote level control included.Mount BassLink vertically or horizontally. Click to enlarge.Designed to deliver low frequencies in virtually any car audio system, BassLink truly has universal appeal. Small in size but big in output, BassLink requires a mere .75 cubic feet of trunk space yet produces enough bass to wake up the neighborhood.BassLink consists of a 10-inch subwoofer, 10-inch passive radiator and a 200-watt Class D amplifier housed in a rigid polymer enclosure, all carefully engineered to work together as a unique, integrated system. The extremely versatile BassLink accepts both speaker- and line-level inputs, and it provides an internal low-pass filter, proprietary signal processing and abundant amplification.The BassLink system features a servo-control circuit that continually monitors the voice coil&apos;s position in the magnetic gap and prevents the distortion that occurs when a conventional woofer is overdriven. By integrating cone-excursion information with the instantaneous demands of the music, BassLink can extract loud and deep bass from an enclosure smaller than any before.BassLink includes a fixed, 2nd-order, high-pass filter that eliminates the possibility of over-excursion below Fb, the resonant (tuned) frequency of the vented box. This allows the excursion-monitoring circuit to focus on the excursion at the more meaningful frequencies at and above Fb. The result is a significant increase in bass output.User-adjustable controls allow listeners to set the system&apos;s response to achieve optimum performance based on the vehicle&apos;s cabin gain or transfer function. These controls include: a 0- or 180-degree phase switch; a continuously variable electronic low-pass filter that is adjustable between 70 and 100Hz; variable input sensitivity; and Bass EQ that provides for adjustments between +3 and -6dB. BassLink&apos;s frequency response in a typical vehicle is 20 to 100Hz (+/-3dB), but this varies according to the vehicle and user adjustments. At maximum gain, the system can accept inputs as low as 250mV.BassLink can accept up to four channels of input--to provide nonfading bass--either from line-level signals through four RCA jacks or from high-level signals through a pair of Molex connectors, allowing BassLink to be easily connected to OEM systems. If using the speaker-level inputs, an audio-sense circuit will turn on the amplifier whenever a signal is present. If the RCAs are used, a 12-volt, remote-turn-on lead is required. The system has barrier strip connections for power, ground and remote turn-on.What&apos;s in the Box

 Added on : Wednesday November 24th 2010 11:40:04 AM I only get a paycheck once a month. I just made another payment on my student loans and looked at my payment history. I&apos;ve put 10k+ in the past 5 months alone towards student loans. I still have a lot more to go. I guess some people lucked out getting good degrees from good schools without much debt. I wish I did things right from the first time and not be so clueless in high school. If that was the case, I would&apos;ve been just fine with a B.S. degreeAnyone else?

 Added on : Saturday November 20th 2010 05:40:13 PM This is my first post on this site and I would appreciate any and all feedback on this post. I dont mind getting a red if you consider this topic inappropriate.If you could, would you take advantage of a product/service that could enable you to predict, with a reasonable degree of certainty within a 10% range, both the short term outcome (think 12 to 60 months) and long term outcome (think Retirement and beyond) of ANY financial commitment that you are considering BEFORE you take decisive action. Everyday we are faced with a multitude of financial decisions that could have a tremendous impact on our financial security, yet very few understand exactly what the long term outcomes are involved in those decisions; other than feeling somewhat comfortable that the monthly payments are affordable. Undoubtedly, given todays economic climate, there are many people out there who might have done things differently if only they knew what was coming. While no one could have accurately predicted what we are going through today, there are ways to safeguard yourself from being a victim of the times, and have more control of your financial stability. Heres just a few of lifes financial decisions that Ive identified in which a product/service of this type might be able to help someone. Feel free to add any others you might think of.What are the short term and long term financial ramnifications if: I/we lose our (job/health)?I/we invest in a (401k plan/ profit sharing /stock ownership) offered by my employer?I/we purchase a home or pay rent?I/we purchase that new (vacation home/car/boat/TV/etc.)?I/we take a vacation (cruise/driving vs flying/etc.)?I/we refinance my/our home or pay off my/our credit cardsI/we invest in non guaranteed assets (stocks, commodities, futures etc) versus guaranteed assets (Treasuries, CDs etc)? I/we purchase a Permanent Life Insurance versus Term insurance? Of my/our local, state and federal governments Tax policies?And of course one of the most important decisions one might be faced with sometime during their lifetime: What are the financial ramnifications of getting married versus staying single.Ive developed, and personally tested over a 15year period of time, a method of answering many of these types of questions and many others. I experienced firsthand, the reliability of these forecasts and want to share my success of how I was able to predict, with a considerable degree of accuracy, both my short term and long-term results throughout this period of time. I was thinking that if theres some interest out there for this type of product/service, I might pursue marketing it so that it could be distributed as a software product or an interactive web site. Ive avoided being proactive in sharing this information with others because Im somewhat reluctant to become involved in a time consuming project of developing and implementing a business model to bring this product/service to the market. Im not motivated so much by any personal monetary gain that I might achieve, as I am in being able to assist the low and middle class consumer. Im even giving serious consideration to taking this to a non-profit organization so it could be made available to the public for free. I personally believe that if one could forecast the outcome of a financial decision with a reasonable degree of certainty, then they could have greater control over their personal finances and build a more stable foundation on which to build a future on. Of course this could be both a blessing and a curse to the many corporations who are competing for our hard earned dollar, as we would be the one who would now be in control of deciding how/when we will spend our money and not react to the marketing influences that prey on our emotions.

 Added on : Thursday November 18th 2010 04:40:03 AM Has anyone here had success with self employment, without having a professional degree like doctor, accountant, dentist, lawyer?
If so, what kind of business do you have? Do you primarily work at home in a home office? Self employment seems like a nice idea, being able to be your own boss, set your own schedule, make your own rules.
Not having to worry about being fired or laid off or dealing with coworkers you can&apos;t stand. A lot of wealthy people
tend to be self employed too.Obviously it&apos;s not an easy thing to do though. There&apos;s a lot of risk, and a lot of businesses fail. Competition can be tough
and building a solid, consistent client base is no easy task. You&apos;ll have to pay the self-employment tax and buy your own health insurance.
(Although you also qualify for a lot of tax deductions for your business expenses.)So for those of you who have been self employed, what kinds of goods or services do you provide? Cuisinart Chef&apos;s Classic Saute Pan 5.5qt ($34.97 was $140.00) @ Amazon

# Auto shutoff Does my undergrad school matter? 
 Added on : Sunday November 14th 2010 05:40:04 PM I&apos;m going to finish up my undergrad soon in business. At one school, I can go basically for free with grants, and be done in one year. This school is not rated very highly. Another option is to go to the bigger state school, which may cost a thousand or two more, and will probably take an extra 2-3 quarters. This school is rated better, but not off the charts; maybe top 50 for this program. My GPA is above 3.5, and probably won&apos;t be affected by my choice of school. I also have very good test scores.My question is, is it worth it to sink extra time and possibly extra money into a better ranked school, or just get the damn degree? I&apos;m leaning most heavily toward an MBA for grad school if I do go. I don&apos;t care about the &quot;quality&quot; of my education for any moral, personal growth, or spiritual reasons. It&apos;s a piece of paper to prove I know what I actually know. LG 32LE5300 32&quot; 1080p 120 Hz LED LCD HDTV $499.99 Amazon

Meet Roboni-i, a highly-intelligent robot that fuses interactive, remote-controlled gameplay with advanced robotic technology. Operated wirelessly using a handheld controller and featuring four processors and 16 sensors, Roboni-i can sense and respond to his environment, explore the room on its own, and even engage in games with other Roboni-i units. A great toy for young robotics enthusiasts, Roboni-i can also be linked to your computer, allowing to reprogram his behavior and upload customized games.

Roboni-i Robotic Gaming System
Ages: 13+Requires:
Roboni-i: 6 x AA batteries
Mobile controller: 4 x AA batteries
BaseStation: 2 x AA batteriesSystem Requirements:
Windows XP/Vista/7
CD-ROM drive





What We ThinkFun factor:
Durability:
Ease of assembly:
Educational factor:
Novelty factor: The Good: Cutting-edge robotics technology; intuitive RC controls; customizable robot behaviorsThe Challenging: Robot is a bit too jittery when left alone; editing programs require some technical savvyIn a Nutshell: Highly advanced, interactive robot toy, ideal for older children and robotics enthusiasts




Roboni-i senses his environment using infrared and touch sensors. View larger.
The controller features an intuitive design and an LED screen where you can view your Roboni-i&apos;s status. View larger. Cutting-Edge Robotic Technology
With his futuristic architecture and space-age silver color, Roboni-i would fit right at home in a science fiction movie. He features a durable plastic chassis that protects his intricate inner technology.Inside of Roboni-i are 12 infrared sensors, which the robot uses to sense his surroundings, &quot;talk&quot; to other robots and communicate with the included BaseStation. He also features highly-sensitive touch sensors on his front and back bumpers, allowing him to sense even the slightest physical contact.When Roboni-i senses something, he responds immediately by executing complex behaviors. For instance, if he collides with a wall, he&apos;ll whistle with displeasure, turn around, and proceed in the opposite direction. If he spots his BaseStation or another Roboni-i unit, he might fire off his laser. If left by himself for more than 30 seconds, he may even begin to explore the environment on his own. He&apos;ll always remain near his BaseStation, though, so you don&apos;t have to worry about him wandering off by himself. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fast, Nimble Remote-Control Action
With a full, 360-degree range of motion, Roboni-i is incredibly agile. You control Roboni-i using a comfortable handheld controller, which communicates wirelessly with the robot. The controller&apos;s LCD screen displays various aspects of the robot&apos;s status, such as his level of &quot;happiness,&quot; his battery life, current game mode, and so on.
The robot is surprisingly fast, and he&apos;s even capable of stunts and loops. Keep in mind that his plastic frame houses complex electronics, so don&apos;t get too wild with your stunts. He&apos;s by no means an all-terrain vehicle and is best driven on a hard, flat surface. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roboni-i features the latest in robotic toy technology. View larger. Loaded with Personality
Roboni-i isn&apos;t just a mindless automaton that you control. He is a moody, sensitive robot that seems to have a mind of his own! He is at his happiest when he gets lots of attention, and when he is in close vicinity to his BaseStation.
If you switch his BaseStation off or move it out of reach, he will have a robotic &quot;freak-out&quot; and begin frantically searching for it. When he&apos;s in a good mood, he will randomly fire off his laser, run away and &quot;hide&quot; from you, and perform other playful acts. When you pay close attention to Roboni-i, you earn &quot;RoboTX&quot; levels -- a measure of how much your robot trusts you. As you earn more and more RoboTX levels, your robot will gain access to more advanced actions and movements. This is a fun feature that allows your robot to grow dynamically with you as its owner. However, it also requires you to invest time in playing with your robot in order to get the most out of the toy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roboni-i can engage in multiplayer gameplay with other Roboni-i robots. View larger. Interactive Single- and Multi-Player Games
The feature that distinguishes Roboni-i from other robotic competitors is its ability to participate in real gameplay and multiplayer games with other Roboni-i owners. To set up a multiplayer game, the robots must &quot;join&quot; each other in a group so they will be able to identify each other. Once this happens, you&apos;re free to interact with other Roboni-i units and play games with them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Reprogram Roboni-i with Your Computer
Edit Roboni-i&apos;s behavior with your PC. View larger.
Using the included Command Center program, you can customize the way your Roboni-i reacts to different stimuli. The program is very easy to use, although it does take some degree of computer competence (which younger kids may not have.) A drag-and-drop menu lets you easily program your robot to reverse, spin around, crabwalk, flash its activity LEDs, and more. The program also comes with a comprehensive tutorial, making it easy to learn how to use your robot.
The Command Center program is compatible with Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7. It is backed by a 1-year limited warranty. New I&apos;Coo Pacific Ultra Lightweight Aluminium Baby Stroller-Bassinet - $299.95 Shipped (MSRP $599) @ shnoop

Ingenious German engineering and ergonomic design enables you to
switch from recline to upright position in less than a minute!!!Introducing the all new i&apos;coo Pacific stroller. Built on a German-engineered, light weight frame and loaded with an impressive list of standard features, the i&apos;coo Pacific is in a class of it&apos;s own. Created from the same genes, but different chromosomes as the Targo, the new i&apos;coo Pacific stroller features a on-the-fly bassinet to seat system. Constructed of light weight aluminum, the i&apos;coo Pacific stroller frame is an engineering marvel. One frame allows you to control all aspects of comfort for both you and your baby. The i&apos;coo Pacific also has an extendable canopy and an attachable boot cover. The same handling and ultra-smooth ride as the Targo, the Pacific is virtually effortless to push. The height elevation feature allows for more room in the basket below and is elevated to table height, eliminating the need for a high chair when on the road. The i&apos;coo Pacific is designed with your baby&apos;s comfort in mind. The ergonomic seat allows your baby an infinite number of seating positions, including laying completely flat. In fact, it takes less then a minute to transform the seat into the bassinet.Please note: This item will ship out in 3-5 business days

 Added on : Wednesday November 03rd 2010 12:40:15 AM New Early Warning EW-101 22 Band Digital Radar/Laser Detector - Detects All 22-Frequencies Now In Use As Of September 2010Specs: 11 Radar 9 Laser 2 Safety Alert Systems, POP Mode Radar Gun Detection, Ku Band Detection, 180-Degree laser protectionProduct Description:
The thought of having super human powers appeals to most people. Who wouldn&apos;t want to be able to see into the future or to climb up the sides of tall buildings with nothing but your bare hands? Some people actually believe that the powers fantasized about in comic books and cartoons actually have been implemented in various people&apos;s everyday lives.There have been many speculations on people that seem to be super flexible almost like a realistic ElastaBoy, a real life Wolfman, even those who can attract items to their body using only their mind.Sure there are TV shows and news bulletins that try to convince us that these occurrences are nothing short of super human, but the fact is that none of us really are super-human. We can&apos;t climb walls or read minds, we are all just simple human creations that might have been born with an extraordinary tweak that&apos;s all. Sure, one who stand upside down on the top rung of a ladder balanced on the ledge of a cliff might have been able to conquer fear or achieve a unique balancing ability, bur he is no more talented than somebody who drives with the Early Warning EW-101 Digital Radar/Laser Detector.Yes, that&apos;s right. With this radar detector. you too can reach superhuman- like speeds and not have to worry about being caught by the cops ever again. Just because you have a device that can detect all police radar activity, as been updated since September 2010, giving you the ability to speed fast than ever sped before, doesn&apos;t make you Superman or anything. No, just like the Wolfman got himself a fuzzy suit and amazing growl, you&apos;re just a guy who happened to obtain a device that will allow him to speed with out getting caught. Simple as that.So, are there superhumans out there? The answer is no. Unless you have the ability to calm my girlfriend down after she catches me leaving chicken bones and Doritos crumbs in the bed for the fifty-billionth time. Then we can talk about superhuman.Product Features:
The Early Warning EW-101 Digital Radar/Laser Detector provides superior protection, outstanding range, travel information and many other convenient features you will love.
The EW-101 detects 22 different frequencies at long range and identifies the signals quickly and easily.

The EW-101 also detects safety alert transmitters to indicate when emergency vehicles, trains, road hazards, school buses and other safety or emergency vehicles are approaching.
The EW-101 also provides total immunity to VG-2, Spectre I, II, III, and Spectre IV radar detector detection devices and gives you a heads-up when they&apos;re in use nearby too.
The EW-101 features city/highway modes to reduce false alarms in densely populated areas and its intelligent muting keeps false audio alerts to a minimum.
The EW-101 will power off automatically to save the battery when you turn your car off, and the built-in memory remembers your settings for an indefinite amount of time without power.
The EW-101 also detects Ku frequency which was recently approved for use in the United States.

 Boston College law student asks for his money back. 
 Added on : Thursday October 21st 2010 03:40:03 AM LinkI thought this was interesting with the number of lawyers that post on here.

In a letter to the school&apos;s paper, a third-year Boston College law student made a proposition to the school&apos;s dean: Give him his money back, and he&apos;ll leave school without his degree.&quot;Unfortunately, the occasion for me writing to you is not a happy one,&quot; the letter, originally printed in the Eagleionline, goes. The anonymous student goes on to explain that the lackluster job market, a massive student loan debt load and his wife&apos;s pregnancy are all causing him undue stress. His solution to the problem:I am willing to leave law school, without a degree, at the end of this semester. In return, I would like a full refund of the tuition I&apos;ve paid over the last two and a half years. This will benefit both of us: on the one hand, I will be free to return to the teaching career I left to come here. I&apos;ll be able to provide for my family without the crushing weight of my law school loans. On the other hand, this will help BC Law go up in the rankings, since you will not have to report my unemployment at graduation to US News. This will present no loss to me, only gain: in today&apos;s job market, a J.D. seems to be more of a liability than an asset. I will explain the gap in my resume by simply saying that I attended law school, but was unable to finish for financial reasons. In the short run, refunding my tuition might present a financial challenge to the law school, but in the long run, better US News rankings will help you far more than having yet another disgruntled and unemployed alumnus.According to the Boston Herald, the law school will not capitulate to the student&apos;s request:The law school said in a statement yesterday it is &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about its students&apos; job prospects but no institution of higher education can guarantee a job after graduation. &quot;What we can do is provide the best education possible, and work together to provide as many career opportunities as possible,&quot; the statement said.
Yearly tuition for BC law comes in at around $60,000. Tamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP ZL Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras Price AR: $414 Amazon

Product Description
This laser level and laser tape combination is a fantastic pairing whether you are a professional or a home project enthusiast. These are incredibly helpful if you are hanging cabinets or shelving, hanging wallpaper, installing carpeting, painting, installing suspended ceiling or flooring or just hanging pictures in your home. The laser level is compact, inexpensive and reliable. Strait-Line&apos;s 60 foot laser line can mark a 120-foot work area simply by swiveling the laser, and it&apos;s accurate to + or - 3/16&quot; at a 20 foot distance. This laser level is non-marking so you don&apos;t have to worry about it marring your surfaces. It comes complete with 4 strips of 3M Command Adhesive so you can easily affix it to any vertical or horizontal surface. The laser line also bends so you can accurately level even around corners! The laser level measures 3-5/8&quot; base diameter and 3-1/4&quot; high. The laser tape uses sonic wave technology to measure distances up to 50 feet with the touch of a button. The laser targeting clearly and accurately indicates the point of measurement. The Sonic Laser Tape calculates both the area and volume of a room. The memory positions stores up to 5 important measurements. The Sonic Laser Tape is light weight and compact for easy storage. Company trying to clawback education reimbursement 
 Added on : Wednesday October 20th 2010 08:40:03 AM My sister recently left her old company. She&apos;d recieved some tuition reimbursement to get a Masters degree but left the company before the agreed-upon time she could leave without repaying the money back. She knew this in advance but the new offer was too good to resist.Anyways she owed them about 11k and has paid 6k back. They recently told her they need the 5k by Dec. 1 but also offered to adjust her final W2 so that the 5k would show up there in place of previously tax-deferred money. Maybe she didn&apos;t explain it to me properly but my gut instinct says just pay the 5k and avoid any tinkering with the W2. I guess my question is why the company would want to do things this way? And what possible benefit could my sis get from it? Everest Mummy +5F/-15C Degree Sleeping Bag $25.97 shipped @ Walmart

 Added on : Tuesday October 19th 2010 02:40:14 AM &amp;stRefurb;Rocketfish Universal 90 Watt AC/DC Power Adapter for Laptops $17.95 + $3.99 shipping at Midnightbox
Midnightbox.com - Currently Deal #2This is nice in that it includes the dc power option.
I have this same adapter without the dc power option. It has served me daily for about 6 months. I have a separate dc power adapter that I use but I think I will get one of these and replace what I currently use.It has a much longer cord than the oem Dell power supply. And since the plug is 90 degree instead of straight it is more convenient also. When I bought mine, I bought a total of 5. They were listed as refurb also but only one was ever opened, that is the one I use daily.

This Deal Has Expired Long Term Capital Gains Arbitrage 
 Added on : Sunday October 03rd 2010 10:40:02 PM Question for the FWFers. I have done my own research, and I do have an accounting degree. That being said, I&apos;m not a seasoned tax veteran, and would like advice on this particular transaction.I graduated this May, and have been working since July. Because of this, I will only be in the 15% tax bracket. I live in a state that does not have state income tax. For those who were unaware, the Long Term Capital Gains tax for my bracket is 0% for 2010. My question is this:Are there any ramifications that I&apos;m missing when I say that my grandparents could gift me ~$26,000 in securities ($13,000 each, the maximum before the gift tax comes into play), I can sell them and realize the gains at my 0% tax rate (as long as I don&apos;t bring my income up into the 25% bracket) in December 2010, and then gift the proceeds back in January 2011 (of course, avoid the wash sale rule), thereby avoiding any tax on capital gains?I would appreciate any advice and I hope that this can potentially present an opportunity to others in my situation . Career Crossroads: What would you do or consider? 
 Added on : Thursday September 30th 2010 03:40:03 AM Hi everyone - I&apos;ve been a member of the forum for a while and value all your insights and thought I&apos;d seek some financial/career advice from those with more experience than me.I&apos;m four years out of undergrad with a degree in engineering and have two offers, one pending:1) A revenue assurance specialist role with a broadcasting company, tracking down potential areas of revenue loss and devising process improvements.2) A logistics analyst role with a small eCommerce company (that was recently bought by a publicly traded company) dealing with their shipping, working with carriers and reducing costs and damaged products.pending-
3) A senior associate role with a big four accounting firm in their forensic advisory practice.Salaries/benefits are similar. Work/life balance differs across the board.What would have the best future career prospects? Best chances for business school? I&apos;m not entirely sure what industry/field I&apos;d like to be in long term, so the decision is more difficult. If there&apos;s one field I&apos;d definitely like to be in, it&apos;s probably strategy consulting.My professional background is varied with one year in data analysis/forensic consulting and a couple in business analysis/process improvement.Thanks in advance.

 Added on : Tuesday September 21st 2010 04:40:04 PM All,I am about 6 weeks away from obtaining my bachelor degree and am at a crossroads. I currently am a IT manager in the midwest making between 45-50k per year and am looking to expand that. I have about 5 years total IT work(project management, network admin, management) and I am not sure if the MBA or the MIS is the better degree to go for? It seems these days that EVERYONE has a MBA so my first thought is to go for the MIS. Included in the MIS are some entry level security tests getting you some good experience. I just am not sure which is best. What are your thoughts? Kevlar Gloves $40.67 at Bob&apos;s Bargain Basement

http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.24310~r.88371207 Housing Idea --- Looking for feedback 
 Added on : Thursday September 09th 2010 04:40:03 AM Hello all,
Im a avid reader of these forums, but have never posted. This will be my first post. The time may show as early, as I am writing from Afghanistan. I am an Army Ranger medic, currently on my 5th deployment. This is all relative, because I return in several months, and I will be exiting the service shortly after Xmas, after serving 6.5 years. I plan on returning to college (Didn&apos;t have the discipline or appreciation for education out of high school) and pursuing my degree in economics and international finance. Fortunately, I&apos;ve always had a knack for personal finance, so I&apos;ve saved up a good amount for &apos;college&apos;, and I&apos;m always looking for ways to stretch my dollar.
I am from the Washington DC metro area, in Virginia. For those of you that know the area, it is somewhat expensive, and hasn&apos;t been too damaged by the declining housing market. I have enough for a 20%+ down payment, but I would like to continue to rent and save up capital until things calm down. I did look for housing before this deployment, but I knew that once the 8k tax credit expired, that homes had to drop at least --- well, $8k. To me, that just feels like common sense. To sweeten the deal, since I was deployed in 2009 as well, my $8k tax credit was extended 1 year, so I can still use it until June 2011. That means I could theoretically take advantage of a $16k difference. However, I am also aware that if Im making bold decisions on a half a million dollar asset, all because of a $16k (peanuts in comparison to 500k) perk (that I am not/was not a supporter of), that perhaps I should slow my roll. So slow my roll I am doing.
I am married, and my wife works. She makes decent income. I secured an apartment before I deployed (stationed in GA, but will return to the Virginia area when I exit the service) in Virginia, and she currently lives there, and I moved all our furniture up there. The apartment is not in a bad area, but not in an upclass area either. For my GI Bill benefits, I am granted 100% tuition, plus a housing stipend per month. That stipend is given at the average cost of housing for the zipcode in which the university is in. That puts me at a stipend of about $1900/month. That is awesome, and covers my current apartment there now. Along with my savings, and my wife working, there is plenty of financial cushion. I like that. However, as I said earlier, I would like to stretch my dollar as far as it goes, and I am also all about family... so here is my idea.
I don&apos;t want to buy just yet, but I dont want to throw my money down the drain with rent. My parents had 6 kids, and all are now adults and have all moved out of my parents home. My parents also live in the area. They are, as you may guess, baby boomers, and they are looking to downsize to a smaller home. The home they have now is not too large, but a decent 3Kish SQ foot home. My father still works, but is getting a bit too old to upkeep such a house/yard, etc. It&apos;s a beautiful home, just needs some updating and TLC. He mentioned to me about selling, and I came up with this plan. I&apos;m not exactly asking for a handout from him, but I would definitely receive the advantage of this deal (Also why I&apos;m posting this, to look for any add-on ideas, feedback, etc.)
In my idea, I would basically rent their home from them. They would be my landlord. In turn, they can (and they do have the means) to purchase the smaller home to live in. I could even help them move, as I would be fresh out of the military and take care of any odds and ends for them before I start school/work. My rent, in turn, would basically be their entire mortgage (PITI - principal, interest, tax, insurance). The perk for them is, they can still deduct interest on their taxes, and a perk for me is that the amount of principal in the mortgage amount can purchase me a &apos;stake&apos; in the total value of the home. Almost like purchasing stock in the home. Granted, my father and I would have to come to terms to a set value for the home. For the sake of an example, we will say 500k. If the mortgage-PITI was $2500/month, and the principal was 1000 of that. For 1 month, I would then own a .2% stake in the house. So in the future, if the house were to increase in value, my .2% would get me more than $1k back, but if it were to drop, I would get less than my $1k... Either way, I&apos;d get something back, opposed to just throwing rent money to a stranger. This is sort of a &apos;keeping it in the family&apos; type ordeal. Other things I would do include renovating the home, and doing the upkeep to keep it in good shape. Costs of renovation could either be provided entirely by my father, or we could share it. Honestly, I think he would provide the funds entirely, and wouldnt even ask to increase the before mentioned &apos;set value&apos; of the home. However, I&apos;d be more than willing to cover a pro-rated amount of the upgrade in lieu of how much of a &apos;stake&apos; on the home I had, if you can follow that. The break down is this. I could continue to rent an apartment at say 1500 month, and just tuck away $1000 that I would not be spending to pay the mortgage of a larger house, so I can gain capital... Or I can spend 2500+ on housing, and probably see that $1k per month later on down the road. They both equal to about spending $1500, the difference would be a 2br apartment, and a 5br single family home, nice neighborhood. (I do have 1 daughter). I also would be putting money into my fathers home, which has about 7 years left on the mortgage. I suppose another option is I could use all or some of my &apos;down payment&apos; money to put towards paying off his mortgage, thus getting me more principal per month... (Just an idea, this is the type of stuff I&apos;m looking from all you guys) If the house were to sell later, I could use my stake as a down payment for our own house, or just continue saving it. I dont like the market (I think houses are waaay overpriced up there). Or, if my father would like to keep the house, and use it as an investment property, he can rent it out to people, and use it for income in retirement. (He could &apos;buy&apos; my shares of stock back if he wishes, or we could share the income, or I could maybe buy more &apos;stock&apos; from him). So, in a nutshell (if you want to call this monster post that), that is my housing idea. I would like it because it keeps money in the family, it provides a nice safe enviroment for my family, and I would enjoy doing home improvement projects which would help out my parents, etc.So, if you&apos;ve made it reading this far, I would like to hear any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may have on this idea. For this particular case, no one in my family is really &apos;strained&apos; by the present economy. I could manage just fine renting on my own. My parents are more than willing to &apos;help&apos;, and are not trying to make money or anything else. So, all the terms are pretty loose. If my dad said I could get $1 of ownership in the house for every $2 of principal I put in, that is fine too. I feel good just putting my dollars towards my family rather than a stranger. I&apos;ll rent no matter what.
Of course, I have no idea about the legal aspect of this whole thing, or who claims what or tax form x,y,z, etc... But Im sure that can all get figured out with any professionals on here, or friends I may have in the industry, or through family contacts (sister is an attorney, etc.). Either way, my folks and I both will not &apos;sweat the small stuff&apos;. Thanks again everyone! =) Looking forward to your feedback.JoeAlso, I&apos;ve been brushing up on my high school academics through KhanAcademy.org in preparation for college --- If you have school age (middle/high school/college aged) children, and they need some tutoring (or you want to relearn what you forgot from school), it is a great resource. It&apos;s free, and its ran by a man named Sal Khan. He got his MBA from Harvard, and has made about 1600+ videos on topics covering anything from math, to history, to economics, to &quot;Buying vs. Renting&quot;... It&apos;s worth checking out. My daughter stinks at math, so I bought a cable to display my laptop on the tv, and we can go over certain math areas together in the living room on the big screen when I get home. It&apos;ll be a good time (beats Afghanistan) APC 600W UPS Power Conditioner J10 (Silver) $149.88 shipped @ Vann&apos;s 
 Added on : Thursday September 09th 2010 12:40:14 AM linkann&apos;sA Single Component Will Protect It AllHome electronics cost a lot of money, so it&apos;s smart to protect that investment with an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS). The very real danger of power surges can wipe out valuable information and systems, which means your home theater, computer, and other electronics are at risk. Stop relying on cheap power strips. Instead, use a single component that eliminates all power threats to your high performance AV system.
The J10 Save Money While You Save Your SystemThe J-Type Power Conditioner with Battery Backup offers best value in protection for your home theater system. It&apos;s less expensive than the other APC power conditioners because it doesn&apos;t have extra features like humidity detection or extra control panel options. However, it still offers you the very best in standard protection and will give you what you need: Surge protected outlets. All components safe from damaging surges, spikes and even lightning. And, noise filter banks in the J10 reduce electromagnetic and radio frequency interference that can harm picture and sound quality. Basically, Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) keeps voltage levels steady to ensure safe operation during low and high voltage conditions. So to sum it up battery backup power keeps the home theater on, protects expensive TV bulbs and saves recordings stored on a DVR when the power goes out.
What&apos;s Susceptible To Outages?One blip in your power can cause very costly situation. If there is a surge or even momentary outage, you could lose practically your entire home theater set-up. Your onscreen TV Guide may disappear, your DVR hard drive might be lost, and because the fan stops running to cool them, front projection bulbs can overheat and blow out. This applies to rear-projection lamps as well, such as DLP, LCD and LED projectors. Plus, all that invaluable programming the installer did will get wiped out and send you back to the factory presets, requiring another install. And, not only is home theater at risk, but so are music systems and computer hard drives.
Why Is Power A Problem?We live in the Information Age where countless data is created, transmitted, and stored. Numerous electric-powered machines aid in business and household tasks, as well as entertain and inform us. The reality of living in this time of technological innovation is that the power to run these machines can&apos;t keep up (at least not yet). In many locations around the world, electricity generation, transmission and distribution have not evolved at the same pace as computer and communications equipment. What was built years ago for powering factories producing manufactured goods is struggling to adapt to provide continuous, sufficient-grade power to sensitive electronics processing valuable information.
UPS Stays On And Covers OutagesThankfully, the APC UPS power conditioner stays on long enough to cover such outages, giving you time to shut everything down properly. The transformer in the unit automatically regulates power, allowing the J-type to correct brownouts and over voltages between 90-144 volts to within 5% of 120 volts. If the power goes outside this range the battery back-up will kick in to keep your system safely up and running.
What Is A Power Event?Sags, surges, noise, spikes, blackouts. . . what really happens to connected devices when they experience a power anomaly? A lightning strike is a frequent example, although it is just one of countless problems that can strike your equipment. Imagine lightning has just struck a nearby transformer. If the surge was powerful enough, it traveled instantaneously through wiring (AC, network, serial, phone lines and more) with the electrical equivalent force of a tidal wave. For PC users, the surge could have traveled into your computer via the AC outlet or phone lines. The first casualty is usually a modem or motherboard. Chips go next, and data is lost. Thankfully, you can prevent all that with one device.

Experts agree that keeping the correct air pressure in your tires is as important as giving your engine a tune-up. In fact, the economic benefits may be even greater. With the right amount of air pressure, your tires wear longer, save fuel, enhance handling, and prevent accidents. Failure to maintain the correct air pressure can result in poor gas mileage, reduce tire life, affect vehicle handling, and cause vehicle overloading. If you consider these factors, then the need to routinely check your tire pressure is even clearer.

Check Air Pressure Routinely
Because tires do so much without appearing to need attention, it&apos;s easy to forget about them. However, tires do lose pressure each day, through the process of permeation. In cool weather, a tire will typically lose one or two pounds of air per month. In warm weather, it&apos;s common for tires to lose air at an even higher rate. Tires are also often subjected to flexing and impacts that can diminish air pressure as well. So it&apos;s important to realize that refilling your tires is as important as refilling your gas tank. In fact, associating the need to refill your tires with the need for refilling your fuel supply can also be a useful reminder. Check the air pressure in your tires every other time you stop to fill up at the gas station. That interval will allow you to check your tire pressure consistently enough to maintain recommended air pressure. Another good time to check air pressure is when the tires are rotated. Many vehicles have different tire pressures on the front and rear axle, so remember to have this adjustment made. Also remember to have the pressure in your spare tire checked. The space-saver type spare requires a much higher air pressure level than other tires, and is virtually useless (due to overloading) at lower air pressure levels.

Where To Find Air Pressure Information
The correct air pressure may be found in the vehicle owner&apos;s manual or on the tire placard (attached to the vehicle door edge, doorpost, glove box door or fuel door). The placard tells you the maximum vehicle load, the cold tire pressures and the tire size recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. If you have trouble, visit your local Discount Tire or America&apos;s Tire location for assistance.

Another valuable resource is tire load/inflation tables. Your local Discount Tire/America&apos;s Tire should have a copy. Not only will this document tell you the correct tire pressure for stock sizes, but it will provide the information on optional plus sizes as well. A good example would be the findings on a Honda Civic with the stock size 185/65R-14. The recommended air pressure is 28 psi. Plus one size is 195/55R-15 with a recommended air pressure of 32 psi. Plus two size is 205/45R-16 with a recommended air pressure of 36 psi. Note how the air pressure increases with plus sizing to meet the load carrying capacity for the car.

Other Factors Change Air Pressure
In addition to routine air checks, other circumstances necessitate a visit to the air pump. Seasonal changes or altitude changes create a rise or drop in air pressure (for every 10 degrees change in temperature, tire air pressure changes 1 psi). Perhaps the most overlooked factor is vehicle loading for trucks and RVs. Since these vehicles can be configured and loaded in many ways, actual tire loads should be used to determine the proper inflation pressure. This is best determined by weighing the vehicle. Keep in mind that vehicle loading can change from trip to trip.

Sometimes a small nail, screw or other object will puncture a tire and then act as an inefficient plug. Air pressure drops slowly over a matter of hours or days, undetected by the driver. Your best defense in this circumstance is to be alert to the symptoms of this. Be aware of any pulling or vibration that seems unnatural. Listen for any ticking sounds, which will be especially audible at slow, parking lot speeds. If you detect this, get off the road and inspect the tires on the side of your vehicle where the pull, vibration or unusual sound is occurring. A bulging sidewall and/or excessively hot tire indicates a slow leak. Put on your spare tire and have your tire dealer repair the punctured unit. Ask the repair technician if any sidewall damage has occurred (a powdery residue inside the tire indicates this condition). If sidewall damage has occurred, you will need to have the tire replaced.

How To Check Air Pressure
Properly checking tire pressure requires an accurate air gauge. Many people believe that they can check air pressure just by looking at the tire and judging the sidewall appearance. Also, many people use air meters at service stations, which can be grossly inaccurate due to exposure or abuse. Invest in a quality air gauge. For trucks and RVs, use a dual-head inflation gauge that is calibrated up to 120 psi at 2 psi increments.

When checking your vehicle&apos;s tire pressure, make sure the tires are &quot;cold&quot;. Cold air pressure means that the vehicle has not yet been driven one mile. Remember that driving on a tire increases its temperature and air pressure. If you must drive more than one mile for air, check and record the air pressure in all your tires before you leave. Once at the tire dealer, measure each tire&apos;s inflation again and then note the difference. Inflate the tires with low pressure to a level that is equal to the recommended cold pressure plus the difference at the higher temperature.

 Added on : Wednesday September 01st 2010 08:40:08 PM Hello everyone,I had a general question regarding credit scores.I have been fiscally responsible since I was a teen and my credit score has always been immaculate. At age 25, my credit score was 825.However, at age 28, my current age, I decided to go to law school and take on debt and no job while I completed my degree. I recently received my degree and now am awaiting bar results. I still remained financially responsible with credit cards all through law school.Recently, I applied for a couple of credit cards and I was denied. For the first time ever, they asked for pay stubs. I could not provide as I was a student obviously.More importantly on credit karma, I looked at my credit score recently and it had dipped to below 700 for the first time in my life. I panicked and began researching. In June, my credit score was 750+. I currently have only 3 credit cards. One is paid off completely every month, and one carries a balance with about 50% balance usage ( a no interest card). The third is not being used. I have over 120K student loans. I have never once missed a payment or been late on any credit, carloans, etc in my life.So what could have caused such a drop in my score? Is it my utilization of the one credit card of over 50%? Is it my student loans? Is it being denied a credit card?I appreciate any advice or info. Altec Lansing iM-207 orbit, Portable amplified speaker w/ 24hr playtime , $11.94 shipped @ Amazon.com

High ISO for low light
When light levels fall, the EOS 550D offers an ISO range of up to 6400 - expandable to 12800 for those environments where using flash is undesirable.

You can also shoot high speed 50/60fps movies at 720P for when the action is really fast. An HDMI connection allows High Definition playback of footage and images on any HDTV.

 Added on : Monday August 30th 2010 05:40:03 AM I just graduated with my masters degree last month, and my student loans are going into repayment.I am about to pay off a $7,000 private student loan in full. The money should be in my checking account within the next few days, I transfered it from my savings account on friday.I did this a few months ago with another loan. Both loans were through sallie mae.When I paid off the first loan, I called in and paid via e-check over the phone. I asked if there way any way we could work out a better deal on the accumulated interest, since I was paying them a big lump sum. I figure with the economy in the tank, companies are hurting for liquid assets. I was originally told &quot;Absolutely, we do that all the time, let me transfer you to the correct department.&quot;However once I talked to someone in the department I was tranfered to, I was told no, that was not something they did. I explained about what I had been told before, and was told they only did deals like that for people that were behind on payments.&quot;So your telling me it is to my benefit to get behind on payments, THEN I can pay you less? Because that really seems backwards to me.&quot;Obviously I understand this would mean a huge hit on my credit, which isn&apos;t acceptable, I was just screwing with the phone support person. But it really does tick me off that someone could pay less by not making payments, while someone like me that does want to work with them gets no help.Has anyone successfully worked out a deal to pay less accumulated interest if paying a loan off like this? I&apos;m going to pay this loan off either way this coming week, but it has 2k in interest built up. If I can save myself a bit of money, it would be really nice.If this is a possibility to do without taking a credit hit, what is it called? If I can speak the Lingo, it would be helpful.Thanks!

Four Telescoping Poles Give You a Hand Wherever You Need It
If you&apos;re a contractor or do-it-yourselfer who needs reliable support, 3rd Hand HD poles are the perfect assistant--and they&apos;re never late for work! With a rugged 150-pound load capacity, the heavy-gauge steel poles are as useful as an extra set of hands, and with a neoprene grip, they are incredibly comfortable to use.Designed for optimum versatility, 3rd Hand HD Poles telescope from 4.75 to 12.0 feet in length. This ample range means you can keep your poles on hand from job to job, whether you&apos;re working on high ceilings or in tight spaces.A dual adjustment system gives you two options for quickly choosing your length: use the tightening knob for smaller adjustments or lock in your desired height with the ball detents, which are spaced 12 inches apart along each pole.Once a pole is in position, simply use the easy-pump handle to get maximum stability for clamping, bracing, and support. Use one or two poles for light-duty projects--such as hanging shelves--or all four poles for larger jobs--such as stabilizing ceilings (four Hand HD poles are included in the Contractor Pack).When the job is complete, the poles&apos; quick-release levers make disassembly a snap.Handy Accessories Provide Versatility on the Job
When you&apos;re bracing a workpiece, such as a wooden cabinet, you want to be sure it&apos;s going to remain stable. That&apos;s why each FastCap 3rd Hand HD Poles is equipped with a 360-degree fully articulating head and food (eight included in kit). These 3x3-inch textured pads will solidly grip surfaces at virtually any angle, and they can be micro adjusted for the right fit.When you want a larger grip area at the base of your poles, swap in the 6x6-inch 3rd Hand Universal Feet (four included), which are ideal for just about any job. Or if you&apos;re planning to seal off your work area to minimize dust transfer, attach the magnetic Mag Dust Barrier feet (four included) for a 100% seal and 0% dust.To keep all of these handy feet organized, the 3rd Hand Contractor Pack comes with a ballistic nylon carrying bag. The bag carries all four 3rd Hand HD poles and all the accessories.What&apos;s in the Box

 What to do avoid employer finding out about my job hunt? 
 Added on : Wednesday August 18th 2010 09:40:02 PM So here&apos;s my situation... I graduated with a BS Engineering degree in May 2009, and have been working for the federal government since graduation. I am now at a point where I want to try something completely new and different in a completely new and different role, city, position, etc. I am not 100% sold on leaving yet, but if I can find the right opportunity, I would take it. If I don&apos;t find something new and exciting, I am still OK with staying in my current position. I don&apos;t want to go the route that I have seen my parents go, which is to stay with the same company until they get fired/laid off/etc, and then be SOL and end up looking for a job later on. I&apos;d like to stay with the government (great benefits), which isn&apos;t really a big issue as there are thousands of government jobs out there. However, I am hesitant to post my resume and apply to a bunch of positions (especially ones in a related field to the one I am currently in) on usajobs.gov as there is a good chance that someone I currently work with/for will stumble across my resume or get wind of my job search and take it the wrong way. Any advice here? I don&apos;t want to go to my boss and tell him I am looking for a new job, because I am still happy where I am, but I would like a new opportunity. On the other hand, I don&apos;t want him to find out without my telling him directly. Logitech Z520 Speaker System ($59.99 was $98.99) @ Buy.com

 Western Governors University - Online, Accredited, Reasonable Cost, Non-Profit 
 Added on : Sunday August 15th 2010 10:40:02 AM Has anyone heard of Western Governors University? This non-profit, public, fully accredited, fully online school offers a good value in higher education when compared against other online schools or even against traditional 4-yr public colleges. Tuition cost is a flat rate of about $3000 per six-month semester for as many or as few courses as you can take. The price is the same for in-state or out-of-state students. In addition you can test out of many courses if you have the knowledge and experience in that field. The school targets working adults but would be just as good for high school graduates. It is a particularly good value for self motivated students who cannot or will not attend a traditional college. Their degree offerings are currently limited to master&apos;s and bachelor&apos;s in these areas:- Teachers College
- College of Business
- College of Information Technology
- College of Health Professions
The Unique History of WGUTruly a university without boundaries, Western Governors University is a non-profit online university founded and supported by 19 U.S. governors. At no other time in the history of higher education have the governors of several states joined together to create a university.
It Started with an IdeaThe idea for WGU was born in 1995 at a bipartisan meeting of the Western Governors Association (hence our &quot;western&quot; name). Going into the meeting, the chair of the associationUtah governor Mike Leavitthad the foresight to realize that distance learning technologies had the power to tackle one of the western states most pressing problems: rapid population growth confronted by limited public funds for educational services.The governors decided then and there to create their own university. They agreed that this new university would make maximum use of distance learning technologies, would be collaborative among the western member states, and would use competencies rather than seat time as the measure of its outcomes.

 Helping elderly mother with money problems 
 Added on : Monday August 02nd 2010 06:40:05 PM Sorry I know this post is a bit disorganized but I&apos;m stressed out and trying to quickly work on this problem. I really could use some help to point me in the right direction. Here&apos;s the deal.My mom (widowed) is in a bad financial situation. She lives alone in a fairly small house.Her home is currently valued at $210k-$240k.
No savings or other assets except a fairly large undeveloped property in Texas. It generates a small variable income (averaging $300/month) from contracts with an oil company to mine natural gas. I have no idea what this property is worth as it bought several generations ago.
She owns a car outright but it has little value.One home equity loan of $45k at 8.5%
One home equity line of credit (now fully tapped out) of $175k at 2.5%. (Do the math. She now has approx zero equity in the home.)
Credit Card balances totaling $16k with each one between 25% and 30% APR (ouch).Monthly income (SS, tiny pension, part time job, Texas contract) is about $1300.
Monthly expenses (home equity, min credit card payments, insurance, utilities, grocery, eating out, etc.) are $3500 approximately. My mom is not especially frugal and is not likely to change.She&apos;s currently not late on any house payments but sometimes pays credit cards late (ouch again).My wife and I live about 4 hours away. My mom kept her financial dealings very private until this week when she dropped the bombshell that she has run out of money. She has now allowed me to know everything and I&apos;m scared. She&apos;s 75 and is beginning to have trouble keeping the house clean and the lawn mowed. We visit about once every month and feel that we&apos;re working much of the weekend getting the house back in shape. However, my Mom desperately wants to stay in the house. Also, she won&apos;t even consider selling the Texas property. She says it&apos;s in a &quot;trust&quot; but I haven&apos;t found any paperwork on this yet.My sister lives less than 1 hour away from her and she is very handy at fixing things, so she is a tremendous help to our Mom. She is married (no kids) and I know she has been giving Mom money (a few thousand so far). My sister has some money and a good income, and thinks she may be able to keep up with Mom&apos;s monthly shortfall. She made the arguments that she&apos;ll be able to get this money back from the &quot;estate&quot; once Mom dies, but I am doubtful this plan will end well.I have one kid in college and three more headed that way soon. In other words, I can&apos;t spend real money on Mom as it will be a huge financial struggle to get these kids through college. I must fulfill that obligation to make it possible for them to get a degree.I know we can help cut her expenses some as her cable bill, internet bill, cell phone and house phone bill are all ridiculously high. But as you can see from above, it won&apos;t help enough. It feels like I&apos;m fixing tiny leaks in the Titanic and ignoring the huge holes.What do you guys recommend? We&apos;ve thought about bankruptcy for her but we have no idea how to even start looking into this. Medicaid, too?We&apos;ve thought about having her alternate living with us and my sister for about 3 months at a time. Honestly this will be tough for all parties involved but we&apos;ll do it if we have to.Some type of elder housing where she can interact with other people the same age would be ideal. She&apos;s not very social anymore and does get lonely.For those of you reading this that have non-wealthy parents living alone: Learn from my mistakes and sit them down now to find out what&apos;s going on with their finances.Thanks everyone. 4 LED 360 Rotatable Lamp Clip $0.59 ac / shipped @ Meritline

 Added on : Tuesday July 27th 2010 05:40:01 AM So I have been self-employed for roughly 2 1/2 years and at any moment I could be forced into looking for 8-5 work. I am interested in finding out how hard it is to make the switch. Do companies like people that come from a self-employed background or is it strictly about how you present yourself and the job you did not what you did. I haven&apos;t even used my Finance degree so looking for work in that field is probably highly unlikely given my current work experience. What about getting your MBA after coming off a gig like this? I was thinking it might help me differentiate myself from other job hunters but on the same hand I have never worked in an &quot;8-5&quot; setting. I am fairly certain it wouldn&apos;t matter what I did as long as I could bring some sort of applicable business experience to discussion.

This Deal Has Expired my career crossroads - looking for suggestions 
 Added on : Monday July 26th 2010 07:40:03 PM Yet another career advice seeker Current situation:
Early 30s
Work as an analyst supporting operations/sales - been there a tad over 2 years
Live in a midwest city that&apos;s isn&apos;t really an economic hot bed
Make $58-59k total comp
Get 3% raise each year (can be good&amp;bad)
Degrees - Bachelor&apos;s Finance&amp;MBA w/ Finance Concentration (both state schools, nothing special)
3rd job - 1st worked in retail mgt out of undergrad, 2nd worked in operations for a business processing outsourcing company doing a variety of jobs&amp;3rd now work for a mega corp insurance company
In decent shape financially despite the grad school loans/expense set back
Still renting and trying to stay mobile
Employer will provide tuition reimbursement - I live close to a state university&amp;a community college that offers a variety of courses
Job Pros:
Not demanding from a time perspective so I do well given the amount of time I have to spend @ work
Relatively safe right now despite being in an industry with a questionable future (I expect downsizing to continue)
Benefits are pretty good - 100% on 6% w/ good low cost investment options, PTO isn&apos;t bad, etc.
Have the opportunity to WAH so more money could be saved from thatJob Cons:
Sort of feel like I reached the max with job since I am already a level 2 on the salary scale and there isn&apos;t a Sr. level role
Don&apos;t have anyone that could be a mentor and learn from (most of the people I work with are pretty average&amp;can&apos;t even do the little I have taught myself to do)
It&apos;s really boring and in a boring industry
Thoughts:
I don&apos;t know if I am being impatient or maybe a job is just a job but I wanted to get some input given my current situation. I am kind of bored with my current job as with others I have had so I have been thinking about pursuing other career options for some time now. Although I would like to make good money I would also like to enjoy what I do more as I expect to have plenty of working years ahead. Also hoping to go into something that could make me really mobile meaning I could take my skills&amp;find work anywhere.About me:
ISTJ - good with people but I&apos;m not going to go out of my way in most social situations (why I haven&apos;t even thought about trying my hand at becoming a financial planner)
So-so with Math - only got a B in Calc I
Enjoy some variety&amp;challenge
Prefer to work alone in most cases but enjoy learning from a group or having access to that or being around some smart people
Not sure if I like the hard core desk jobs (what I do today)
at times I think I would like more hands on work mixed w/ desk work
Good at shifting through data and forming conclusions
So-so tech skills - not strong enough beyond the usual MS Office stuff; understand how some stuff works and have learned some SQL/data mining stuff on my own in my current job but nothing to brag aboutCareers OR career moves I have considered&amp;downsides (note - dental or med school is not on there, don&apos;t think I am quite smart enough ):
Physician Assistant - 2 years FT; I lack almost all science pre-reqs being that I was a business major
Nurse Practitioner - my sister does this and seems to have a great set up; pretty decent money but less upside than other fields&amp;she had to pay her dues with a few years as an overnight RN (not easy by any means); she did her Master&apos;s @ night&amp;worked FT w/o a problem
Pharmacist - not sure I could get in, 3/4 yrs, heavy borrowing&amp;again, I lack all science pre-reqs
&lt;&lt;&lt;like the stability health care offers&gt;&gt;&gt;Engineer - of some specialty; not sure about the math part but I think I could put in the effort to make it now that I am more mature&amp;it seems to touch on that creative, challenging side
Accounting - started out as an accounting major but it just seemed too boring for me but I admit there always seems to be work there
Actually have even thought about some small business to start - landscaping or shop owner; less money I am sure but the idea of being free from the corporate dullness is appealingAssuming I say skip the extra school and go with what I have:
Guess I suppose I could just keep job hopping, paying down student loan debt, saving money, etc. I just feel it&apos;s sort of directionless&amp;being an ISTJ I like having a plan . I have toyed with the idea of moving to a bigger city w/ a better job market but I&apos;m not really a big city person. But my friend, for example, was unemployable around where I live but moved to DC and has done well.Also note - I am willing to be patient if school is needed and willing to just take a few classes (if it&apos;s pre-req type stuff) so I can continue to work&amp;better myself financially before taking on any additional debt.Appreciate any suggestions, any &quot;if I had to do it again&quot; ideas, any shared stories, etc.Thanks GearWrench 8 pc.

 Added on : Friday July 02nd 2010 05:40:08 PM Link
Really makes my generation look bad. I know it was a legal document but come on, this is very selfish. 
Arguing over money is nothing new for most families, especially when recent college graduates with massive student loans start looking to their parents for economic assistance in today&apos;s tough job market. And things can get tense when parents try to decide how much of that debt they&apos;re willing to help out with.Dana didn&apos;t take a lawsuit against her own father based on a mere promise, howevershe had a legal document to back her up.When Howard and Deborah Soderberg divorced in 2004, Howarda property developeragreed to pay for the education of their three children.Apparently Dana foresaw that his word wouldn&apos;t be enough. In 2005, she convinced her father to sign a written contract that would require him to pay for her college tuition until she turned 25, as well as cover related expenses such as textbooks and car insurance. For her part, she agreed to apply for student loans that her father would cover if she received them.But Howard stopped paying her tuition just before her senior year, forcing Dana to take out a $20,000 student loan (co-signed by her mother). After graduating as an art major, Dana filed a breach of contract lawsuit against her father with the aid of family attorney Renee C. Berman.Representing himself in court, Howard contended that his daughter nullified their contract first when shesupposedlydidn&apos;t try hard enough to apply for student loans. He even filed a counterclaim alleging that she dropped a few classes and kept the money for herself. In Dana&apos;s defense, Berman pointed out that Dana was forced to drop some courses due to the continued tardiness of her father&apos;s tuition payments.&quot;They just don&apos;t have a relationship,&quot; Berman said about Dana and Howard. &quot;It has to be weak to begin with if you enter into that agreement.&quot;Berman also noted how unperturbed Dana&apos;s dad seemed throughout the trial. &quot;Here his daughter&apos;s bringing him to court and there&apos;s no sadness, no remorse that his daughter was in this situation having to sue him.&quot;After two-day trial, the judge ruled that Dana had indeed fulfilled her part of the contract and awarded her about $47,000 in damages, which covered the initial loan, interest and attorney fees.If a daughter successfully suing her father for nearly $50,000 to recoup the cost of her college loans sounds unusual, Dana&apos;s attorney would be the first to agree. &quot;Nothing that I&apos;ve researched has shown any cases like this and hopefully there won&apos;t be any more, because it&apos;s a sad situation,&quot; Berman admitted.As an art major-turned-teacher facing a grim economy (liberal arts majors&apos; salaries&apos; dropped 8.9 percent in the last year), Dana&apos;s legal victory should ease some of her monetary concerns. But most college grads can&apos;t turn to the legal system to relieve them of their student loan woes. Unlike other types of debtsuch as mortgage or credit cardstudent loans aren&apos;t wiped away by declaring bankruptcy.That means grads who can&apos;t afford to make ends meet can end up defaulting on their loans, which effectively ruins their credit. What&apos;s worse, defaulting means being turned over to a collection agencyand the fee that incurs can turn an already imposing amount of debt into downright terrifying numbers.Dr. Michelle Bisutti, for instance, finished medical school in 2003 with $250,000 in student loans. Today, she owes $555,000and $53,000 of that is just a fee for being turned over to a collection agency.The New York Times recently shared the story of Cortney Munna, a college grad who was convinced her NYU degree was worth the approximately $97,000 in loans she took out to pay for it. Now almost a third of Munna&apos;s income goes to covering the federal and private loans she took out to nab that NYU degree.While most college grads don&apos;t owe money in excess of $100,000 (10 percent of the 2007-08 class owes more than $40,000), at least two-thirds of those who complete a four-year program end up owing an average of $23,000 in student loans.And that&apos;s bad news for people who are slowly finding out a college degree isn&apos;t necessarily as profitable as they have been led to believe.Recent studies indicate that while having a college degree tends to ensure a higher salary than those with a high school diploma, the increase in pay scale isn&apos;t as large as society often assumes. According to a study conducted for Bloomberg Businessweek, most of the people who recoup the cost of their higher education and out-earn high school grads by over a million dollars (over the course of their lives) primarily come from elite private schools.For the majority of Americans who can&apos;t afford an Ivy League education, there are plenty of state schools that offer competitive academics at much more reasonable prices. The University of North Carolina recently topped Kiplinger&apos;s &quot;Best Value in Public Colleges&quot; list, and UNC grads don&apos;t seem to be hit as hard by the student debt crisis. The average UNC grad ends up with $14,936 worth of debta full $8,000 less than the national average.So, for those whose parents aren&apos;t legally bound to cover the cost of their education, there&apos;s still hope for earning back the money you invest in your education.

Standard Warranty 1 Year Limited Terrific Camera Deal Fujifilm S2550 bundle w/ 18x optical lens, 12 megapixel, w/case&amp;4gb memory - $179! Hurry! 
 Added on : Friday June 18th 2010 06:40:10 PM This deal appears in today&apos;s Fry&apos;s Friday Sale section of the Sacramento Bee. YMMVIf you have a pretty good digital camera and are a pretty knowledgeable photographer you may be tired of feeling (and looking) like a snapshooter using the usual boxy cigarette pack-sized point-and-shoot digital. This may especially be the case if you were using an SLR before digital cameras took hold. Today&apos;s equivalent, the dSLR and its lens, cost through the roof.Cameras like Fujifilm&apos;s S2550 deliver a degree of performance you will not find n typical point-and-shoots. Equally as important is the inexpensive ego boost they offer to those who long to use a camera which looks the part. This camera, is a clearance item at Frys so YMMV, but if you are looking for a good small but not tiny digital camera you simply cannot do better than Fujifilm&apos;s S2550 digital camera from its well-regarded &quot;S&quot; line. This camera offers the manual operation you may still covet from the old days, the look and feel of an eSLR and a mind boggling array of features.And equipped with an 18x OPTICAL lens (probably augmented by another 4-7x digital telephoto) and the usual stabilization feature you can take unbelievable sports or wildlife photography. My son has a Fujifilm S2000 which I bought him in 08 for Christmas and he says he continues to discover undocumented abilities. He loves it.What electronic item costs $179 today that you can simply sit and stare at and get satisfaction from just the staring. Fraudulent CC ChargeNow Collections 
 Added on : Friday June 18th 2010 10:40:03 AM Timeline12/2/09 12/9/09 Nine purchases fraudulently (one was Verizon Wireless for $197.99) charged to Discover.12/15/09 I was contacted by Discovers fraud department&amp;notified of investigation / account number change, etc. All charges were Security Dispute adjusted.6/17/10 Received voicemail on home phone asking for a return call to (800) 867-3104. Googled phone number and found that it was UCB (United Collections Bureau). I called the number to find out that they are trying to collect on the Verizon Wireless charge for $197.99. I explained that the charges were fraudulent&amp;that Discover completed investigation and that I could have the Discover report sent. UCB stated that they need a police report faxed to them not the Discover report. I called Discover fraud dept. and they offered to fax a letter to UCB, which I accepted.6/18/10 Called Verizon to try to have them fax a letter, but was unable to reach an intelligent enough person (too early in the a.m.)Next steps
Call Verizon again to see what they will do in the name of customer satisfaction. Call UCB to see if the Discover fax was adequate to cease collections. Monitor credit report.Currently, I do not feel that the situation is out of control. UCB has not been obnoxious, but based on what I have read, I am expecting some degree of escalation and that I will have to jump through some more hoops to get things cleared up. I am reluctant to file a police report because I do not feel that it is necessary, and I believe that I would have to purchase a copy (I should have no expenses in this manner).My plan is to handle things somewhat passively, by giving UCB what it takes them to cease collections without spending a dime. (I dont mind spending time as I can learn from the situation), but I am looking for suggestions on alternative ways to approach this. Degree for Women Natureffects Body Mist (Free sample) @ Facebook

This Deal Has Expired VIP-like credit card perks 
 Added on : Wednesday June 16th 2010 01:40:03 PM I&apos;m sure at this point we all know the normal rewards and CashBack bonuses associated with different credit cards. I&apos;m wondering what cards offer the best perks and special treatment, not just CashBack or travel points. For example, I know there has been talk about Visa Signature cards offering certain concierge-like services. What other cards (or companies) offer cool perks to their card holders.I bring this up because of an awesome experience I had with Chase (first time ever). I went to Bonnaroo this past weekend. Turns out, Chase had a special tent with air conditioning, free water, snacks, and private bathrooms with running water, and it was for Chase Freedom card holders. This, of course, was amazing during a 4 day festival with temperatures above 90 degrees, where there were 90,000 people and not a lot of porta-johns. Lots of people paid an extra $600 to purchase Bonnaroo VIP tickets for the similar perks. Any other good VIP-like perks out there? Philips 3-Outlet Travel Strip (Black) $5.99 shipped @ Buy.com

New York State Borrows From the Pension Fund to Pay The Pension Fund 
 Added on : Saturday June 12th 2010 01:40:03 AM http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/nyregion/12pension.html?src=mvALBANY Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders have tentatively agreed to allow the state and municipalities to borrow nearly $6 billion to help them make their required annual payments to the state pension fund.And, in classic budgetary sleight-of-hand, they will borrow the money to make the payments to the pension fund from the same pension fund.As word of the plan spread, some denounced it as a shell game and a blatant effort by state leaders to avoid making difficult decisions, like cutting government spending or reducing pension benefits.Its a classic Albany example of kicking the can down the road, said Harry Wilson, the Republican candidate for comptroller, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard.Pension costs for the state and municipalities are soaring, a result of enhanced retirement benefits for public employees and the decline in the stock market over the past two years. And, given declines in tax revenue and larger budget shortfalls, the governments are struggling to come up with the money to make the contributions.Under the plan, the state and municipalities would borrow the money to reduce their pension contributions for the next three years, in exchange for higher payments over the following decade. They would begin repaying what they borrowed, with interest, in 2013.But Mr. Paterson and other state officials hope the stock market will have rebounded to such a degree by that time that the states overall pension contribution burden will have been reduced.The maneuver would cost the state and local governments about $1.85 billion in interest payments, according to an estimate by the State Senate, though a number of factors could drive interest payments up or down.Another oddity of the plan is that the pension fund, which assumes its assets will earn 8 percent a year, would accept interest payments from the state that would probably be 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent.This would be only the second time the state has borrowed money from its pension fund, and it would involve much more money than the previous time, which occurred in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. New York State faces a $9.2 billion deficit this fiscal year, which began on April 1, and the budget is already more than two months late. The governor and legislative leaders are under pressure to make structural changes that will bring new discipline to state spending, but few expect them to do so.Instead, they are expected to rely heavily on borrowing, tax or fee increases and an array of one-time maneuvers, like tapping the coffers of public authorities.The governor and Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli back borrowing against the pension system, and a tentative agreement to do so was reached after negotiations on Thursday among key lawmakers and the governors representatives. The plan excludes New York City, which has its own pension system.The initial plan in the governors budget called for the borrowing of up to $9 billion over the next six years.Under the agreed-upon plan, the state would be authorized to borrow $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next three years, according to forecasts provided by the governors office and the Senate. Municipalities would be allowed to borrow nearly $4 billion, according to a Senate estimate.Senator Diane J. Savino, a Staten Island Democrat who negotiated the agreement for the Senate, said she pushed for a limit.Theres a question as to whether or not we should do this, she said, adding, I didnt want to leave it open-ended, because six years is too long. The temptation is too great to do it over and over again.As part of the plan, the state and municipalities will have to make higher minimum payments into the pension system during bull markets to mitigate the impact of market crashes.The governors plan, which was included in his executive budget in January, only highlighted the savings that the plan would reap over the next few years and included no mention of the long-term costs.The amount borrowed would depend on various factors, like the stock markets performance, which has fallen sharply since the fiscal year ended in March. The plan also allows state and local governments to choose whether to borrow from the pension fund each year, so much depends on whether future leaders choose to do so.But with pension-contribution rates expected to climb over the next few years, political pressure is likely to be high to defer payments in a climate in which budget problems are coming from many directions.Those pushing the plan are taking pains to avoid describing it as borrowing, saying they are seeking to amortize or smooth pension contributions. That is in part because they have distanced themselves from a plan proposed by Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch that would have the state borrow as much as $6 billion for general operating expenses over the next three years in exchange for budget reforms.Were not borrowing, said Robert Megna, the state budget director and one of the governors top advisers.Mr. DiNapoli, the comptroller, said: We would view it more as an extended-payment plan.Asked about the pension plan, Mr. Ravitch said, Call it what you will, its taking money from future budgets to help solve this years budget.Mr. Megna, when reminded that the plan envisioned delaying an obligation today and eventually paying it back with interest, softened his view in the process of a lengthy interview.Im not going to sit here and characterize it as not a borrowing, he said. But it is an annual, relatively small borrowing were doing this year that were doing to get a modest savings.In 2004 and 2005, the state borrowed $655 million from the pension fund; it still owes more than $400 million.Budget negotiations are expected to continue through the weekend, as state leaders push to reach a broad budget deal. What has become clear is that substantial borrowing will be part of the budget, leaving only the question of the amount.This week, Mr. Paterson called borrowing a last resort, but added, I have never said I wouldnt borrow.
So lets see what we have.After borrowing from the pension fund in 2005, they are going to borrow from the fund again in 2010, and then claim &quot;The temptation is too great to do it over and over again.&quot; as a justification for......not doing it over again.The assets in the pension fund assume 8% returns. This loan only generates a 5% return, so that means other assets have to make up that 3% difference.They&apos;re going to try to engage in market timing by identifying bull markets before the fact and modifying their asset purchases/holdings.Wow. Certainly learned from AIG and company. not sure where to start with ~$200k 
 Added on : Tuesday June 08th 2010 03:40:03 PM Let&apos;s say there&apos;s this fellow who has been apathetic/ignorant about how to invest his cash his entire life. (At this point, he now has ~$100k in cash with Bofa, and ~$100k cash with ingdirect.) Interestingly, he&apos;s actually very anal about things like paying his bills on time, capitalizing on discounted rates, avoiding unnecessary fees, etc. He&apos;s also somewhat educated (ie, he has a post graduate degree). However, he doesn&apos;t quite have a structured approach towards investing--primarily b/c he doesn&apos;t know where to start. If you were him, how you would you manage your ~$200k in cash?He also would like to start with these dumb questions:1) How does he try to figure out how much cash is sufficient to have on-hand for his wife&amp;2 young kids? (I&apos;m guessing ~$20k is sufficient--considering their monthly cash flow is positive...but what do I know.)2) If he should put a large amount of cash into a CD or IRA acct, what is the process for systematically determining if the interest rate is optimal? Is this something that most people do annually, or do they actually watch it monthly? When &quot;watching&quot; it, what exactly are you comparing it to--the US Inflation rate?Sorry if these questions are all over the board.

 Added on : Friday June 04th 2010 06:40:08 PM I was looking for a wall mount for my new 50&quot; Samsung and this is the cheapest I could find.It has up to a 10 degree tilt and the built in bubble level.Link If you were investing $5k each for your infant niece&amp;nephew... how would you do it? 
 Added on : Thursday June 03rd 2010 07:40:06 PM IMPORTANT NOTE: This is NOT for their college educations. My niece/nephew have multiple other relatives and their parents contributing to that.STORY: My wife and I both firm believers in the benefits of world travel. We both had very positive experiences traveling at young ages (late teens) despite coming from small towns and having to go against parent&apos;s wishes to do it (who hadn&apos;t traveled themselves). To help ensure our niece/nephew have the same opportunities regardless of their current finances, we would like to put money aside for them now so it can grow. They are 2.5 years and 6 months of age and we are planning to invest $5k each (or $10k total). I&apos;ve already talked to my sister and her husband and they are cool with us gifting the money for that purpose so this decision is not going to cause familial strife. That said, there are a few restrictions we would like on the investment(s):
We would like the kids to have some &quot;ownership&quot; over it... aka it be at least partially in their name.
However, they can only use it before they are done with college if it is for a structured, study-abroad-type trip.
Or, if they get a degree, they can use it for any travel they wish.
So our options/questions are:
Should we do two separate accounts or one joint account (if it opens up other investment options)?
This is not even remotely enough money for a trust... so we assume that is out.
CDs would definitely be an option... but we are wary about getting locked in at lousy rates.
Money-market/investor-advantage type accounts we assume would also be likely options?
Are there other long-term, relatively safe options we are missing (some sort of joint account for mutual fund, bonds, etc...)?
We are also unsure of the tax implications... In a joint account is the money gifted now? Or only after it is officially handed over?

I searched on the forum and didn&apos;t find any similar posts so I thought I would open it up to you all. If you were in the same position, how would you structure the investment(s)? Maybe 2-3 year CDs now while the economy (hopefully) rebounds, and then re-assess? Or screw it and just bet it all on renewable energy stocks (kidding)? I figure less complicated is better, but we also don&apos;t want them blowing it on the &quot;best spring break&quot; ever. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

 Added on : Wednesday June 02nd 2010 10:40:03 PM Here&apos;s the situation: I started a new job a couple of months ago and they offer $5k/year in tuition reimbursement, and my manager has the discretion to increase it to $10k/year by adding some funds from our contract funds. As of August of this year, I will have officially paid off all of my debts beyond my mortgage and my student loans from undergrad. I had $100k in tuition and books and walked away only having $40k in student loans. While that is still a lot of money, I worked hard to keep it that low and I also learned a great lesson... having that much debt suxors... a lot. So, with this new opportunity, I want to fulfill one of my dreams and earn a very well respected degree at the same time. I plan on going through a executive MBA program at a prestigious school, and the cost for tuition will about $85k. The program will span three calendars year (21 months), so I can get at least $15k from my employer and up to $30k. So, I need to come up with the remainder and still work on paying down my existing student loans and mortgage.So here is my timeline:August 2010 - All debts besides mortgage and student loans are paid. Begin paying extra on student loans (doubling payment) to pay them down and save $1k/month back for graduate school.
January 2011 - Finish my formal application for the program beginning in the Fall of 2011.
July 2011 - Upon acceptance, $2k is payable that applies to my first semester tuition of $19k.
August 2011 - Remaining first semester balance of $17k is payable. Pay down $10k and either get a loan for $7k, or work out a payment plan, or some combination.
December 2011 - Receive $5k tuition reimbursement and pay off any remaining balance through savings since August 2011. $1k in savings at this point, with a potential for an additional $5k from the additional tuition reimbursement.So, at the end of the first semester I will either have $1k or $6k to apply to the second semester... and with no planning beyond this point, I begin to have a serious problem with this plan.Each semester beyond the first is just under $22k. So, I need to come up with a means to make this work without overextending myself. By this time next year I may potentially receive a significant raise, which could make this process much easier. At that point, my goal would be to increase my savings from $1k to $1.5k/month, as I would have to plan for more withholdings from my pay. But that will only yield another $4k by December 2011. I could also stop paying additional money to my existing student loans once I start attending graduate school, but that would only be another $250/mo, or another $3k/year; and by that time, the additional principal I would have been paying would have advanced my repayment to the point that my monthly interest on the loan payments would be less.So, I guess for this to be feasible, the following things MUST happen:1) employer gives me $10k/year and not just the $5k/year
2) I get a $10k/year raise (which is definitely doable for my situation) and save an additional $500/mo
3) stop paying additional principal on my existing student loans when I start school again (an extra $250/mo towards graduate school)
4) find a means to save another $500/month towards schoolTo be honest, my expenses are rather low. I just shopped for new auto insurance and cut it in half... saving myself $100/mo. I have no TV or home phone service and my cell phone is reimbursed by my employer. I am pretty energy efficient at home, so the utilities are low. The only thing that I have right now is shopping for new homeowners insurance, which I have estimated will save me about $50/mo in escrow payments. My mortgage is only 13% of my gross income, which includes my escrow for property taxes and homeowners insurance. So, I really don&apos;t have a whole of lot of room to reduce expenses.I am currently sending a lot for the debt repayment that will be retired in August, and I save back a minimal amount for my children&apos;s education and retirement (employer gives me 10%/year, so that helps a lot there, plus what I put in).So, it appears that I need to find additional income, but I am not going to have much time with my demanding job, graduate school, and family. So, I need passive income. Obviously, if everyone had ways to keep increasing their passive income on here... they wouldn&apos;t be sharing their ideas.Assuming I do those things, however, would the random group of anonymous internet posters here see much of a problem with this? Please don&apos;t bring up the obvious pitfalls, like losing my job, etc... those are risks that I am willing to take... progress is necessary, in my view... and there has to be some minimal risk taking else no one would even get out of bed... unless it was riskier to stay in bed .Thanks in advance. Humor is welcome... and there are no pics anyone would want to see, so sorry for that one. Advice on how to maximize net worth through income production. 
 Added on : Wednesday June 02nd 2010 06:40:02 PM Hello.Allow me to apologize in advance for the long-winded post -- but I have been lurking here for a very long time, and have seen a lot of wisdom here, along with the snarkiness.
I am 32 years old and earn around $25k / year through a variety of side businesses (selling yard sale finds on eBay, the occasional purchase of estate merchandise, selling books on Amazon, scalping tickets on stubhub, etc), married to a 26 year old consultant who earns $130k / year.
Earlier in my life, I made some poor choices when it comes to personal spending -- despite the fact that my formal university training and undergraduate degree are in accounting (believe me, it doesn&apos;t transfer to personal finance skill). As of 2003, several years out of college, I had generated a massive amount of consumer debt (~60k)(to be fair, some portion of it was due to an illness which left me unable to work for a time, but I take full responsibility). I defaulted in 2003 due to an inability to service the debt, and saved money for a few years (slowly, since I have only been making about this much for a while now) -- I attempted to settle the debts, and offers in the 75% off ballpark were refused, so I resolved to allow them to age off of my report and run the SOL out. Unfortunately, legal action was initiated by several creditors in 2007, and I declared chapter 7 and recieved a discharge in late 2008. Since then, I have successfully rebuilt a great deal of credit, and have some substantial savings, thanks largely to my wife&apos;s earnings.Fundamentally, I would like to pull more earning weight, but there is a significant stigma in the labor market against people with unorthodox employment backgrounds, and in the financial occupations, against personal bankruptcy. I have some outdated software development skills, which is the only area that I have worked in a professional setting (despite my training in an unrelated area).I am willing to work hard and do whatever it takes to increase my personal earning power to at least $100k / year in today&apos;s dollars, whether that requires retraining or something else, but I am completely lost as to how to go about doing this given my background. It has been over 10 years since I have had a non self-employed position, and all employers that I have worked for (.coms) are defunct. The ultimate goal is to acquire critical financial net worth to support spending of $50k/ year in 2010 dollars for the two of us indefinitely. At this time, that would be about $2.5mil I figure, with conservative assumptions about return and drawdown rates -- as we age, this number will decline substantially. I have a preference for intellectually active tasks rich with strategic challenge over the easy or menial, but will do essentially anything.Total net worth at this time is about $100k liquid. $40k in cash, 60k retirement accounts. No debt, one paid for car, we rent.Thank you in advance for your useful suggestions, and your jokes at my expense.

 Added on : Saturday May 29th 2010 11:40:02 AM Link
Like many middle-class families, Cortney Munna and her mother began the college selection process with a grim determination. They would do whatever they could to get Cortney into the best possible college, and they maintained a blind faith that the investment would be worth it.
Cortney Munna hoped for the best when she decided to attend New York University. Now she owes $100,000.Citibank gave Cortney Munna $40,000 in loans, though she had already amassed debt well into the five figures. It was like the no doc loans that home buyers used to get in over their heads.
Today, however, Ms. Munna, a 26-year-old graduate of New York University, has nearly $100,000 in student loan debt from her four years in college, and affording the full monthly payments would be a struggle. For much of the time since her 2005 graduation, shes been enrolled in night school, which allows her to defer loan payments.This is not a long-term solution, because the interest on the loans continues to pile up. So in an eerie echo of the mortgage crisis, tens of thousands of people like Ms. Munna are facing a reckoning. They and their families made borrowing decisions based more on emotion than reason, much as subprime borrowers assumed the value of their houses would always go up.Meanwhile, universities like N.Y.U. enrolled students without asking many questions about whether they could afford a $50,000 annual tuition bill. Then the colleges introduced the students to lenders who underwrote big loans without any idea of what the students might earn someday just like the mortgage lenders who didnt ask borrowers to verify their incomes.Ms. Munna does not want to walk away from her loans in the same way many mortgage holders are. It would be difficult in any event because federal bankruptcy law makes it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debts. But unless she manages to improve her income quickly, she doesnt have a lot of good options for digging out.It is utterly depressing that there are so many people like her facing decades of payments, limited capacity to buy a home and a debt burden that can repel potential life partners. For starters, its a shared failure of parenting and loan underwriting.But perhaps the biggest share lies with colleges and universities because they have the most knowledge of the financial aid process. And I would argue that they had an obligation to counsel students like Ms. Munna, who got in too far over their heads.How many people are like her? According to the College Boards Trends in Student Aid study, 10 percent of people who graduated in 2007-8 with student loans had borrowed $40,000 or more. The median debt for bachelors degree recipients who borrowed while attending private, nonprofit colleges was $22,380.The Project on Student Debt, a research and advocacy organization in Oakland, Calif., used federal data to estimate that 206,000 people graduated from college (including many from for-profit universities) with more than $40,000 in student loan debt in that same period. Thats a ninefold increase over the number of people in 1996, using 2008 dollars.The FamilyNo one forces borrowers to take out these loans, and Ms. Munna and her mother, Cathryn, have spent the years since her graduation trying to understand where they went wrong. Ms. Munnas father died when she was 13, after a series of illnesses.She started college at age 17 and borrowed as much money as she could under the federal loan program. To make up the difference between her grants and work study money and the total cost of attending, her mother co-signed two private loans with Sallie Mae totaling about $20,000.When they applied for a third loan, however, Sallie Mae rejected the application, citing Cathryns credit history. She had returned to college herself to finish her bachelors degree and was also borrowing money. N.Y.U. suggested a federal Plus loan for parents, but that would have required immediate payments, something the mother couldnt afford. So before Cortneys junior year, N.Y.U. recommended that she apply for a private student loan on her own with Citibank.Over the course of the next two years, starting when she was still a teenager, she borrowed about $40,000 from Citibank without thinking much about how she would pay it back. How could her mother have let her run up that debt, and why didnt she try to make her daughter transfer to, say, the best school in the much cheaper state university system in New York? All I could see was college, and a good college and how proud I was of her, Cathryn said. All we needed to do was get this education and get the good job. This is the thing that eats away at me, the navet on my part.But Cortney resists the idea that this is a tale of bad parenting. To me, it would be an uncharitable reading, she said. My mother has tried her best, and I dont blame her for anything in this.Sallie Mae gets a pass here, in my view. A responsible grownup co-signed for its loans to the Munnas, and the company eventually cut them off.But what was Citi thinking, handing over $40,000 to an undergraduate who had already amassed debt well into the five figures? This was, in effect, a no doc or at least a low doc subprime mortgage loan.A Citi spokesman declined to comment, even though Ms. Munna was willing to sign a waiver giving Citi permission to talk about her loans. Perhaps the bank worried that once it approved one loan, cutting her off would have led her to drop out or transfer and have trouble paying back the loan. 
I fully have to concur with this. I believe 99% of kids would be better off going to a public school and investing the difference rather than going to a private school; The only exceptions being your Harvard/Yale/Princeton candidates.Most 18-20 year olds I know (and certainly me when I was that age) are not mature enough or forward thinking enough to merit the extra money.Subsidized loans have led to higher tuition have led to more subsidies. Rather than boosting grants and tossing away taxpayer dollars in a frivolous manner as some in power want to do, it&apos;s time to break the cycle. Not everyone is cut out for college. 60% off tuition @ University of Texas [Nursing or Education] - possibly other schools and degrees available

 Added on : Thursday May 13th 2010 12:40:08 PM Nice Info, I Pulled From S/D Thanks to cubsgirl23HUGE savings on orthodontic braces. Save up to $3600.00
Ok, thought I would share my ( cubsgirl23 over at S/D ) recent experience with braces. They are extremely expensive and if I had taken the first choice and not have done my homework, I would have paid about $3600.00 more than I did. First I started just using friends ortho&apos;s, etc to get estimates. Then, I found out we had a local school that teaches orthodontics that offers braces at about a $2000 discount right from the get go because you agree to have a Dr. who is interning to oversee your kids progress but the dean of the school has to sign off on every move, so you know they are in good hands. The Deans are very experienced (as in older experienced orthodontists). in my process, I discovered that most orthodontists have a prepayment discount of 10% (standard at every office that I checked was this 10% discount). Also, if you have dental insurance, you can pay upfront and then get reimbursed , here is my breakdown and my savings. We note everyday how we save a few dollars or even $50 to $100...this was alot of money and I thought when I saw it actually on paper that I needed to share it!! There are levels or degrees of cases - some mouths are worse than others. Mine has a bad one requiring 3 + years of care.Regular office: $4300.00 for entire plan (worst damage stage plan)
-$ 430.00 (10% discount for paying upfront)
$3870.00 (Final cost without insurance)
-$1500.00 (Reimbursement from Insurance company)
$2370.00 (Final Cost with Insurance)Ortho School: $2410.00 for entire plan (again worst damage stage plan)
- $ 240.00 (10% discount for paying up front)
$2170.00 (Final cost without insurance)
- $1500.00 (Reimbursement from Insurance Company)
$ 670.00 (Final Cost with Insurance)Even without insurance, the ortho school is so much cheaper. I thought it would serve well to make a list of local ortho schools. I will start and if you know of one in your city, add it to the list for those who might not know it exists. Northeast Florida Ortho School:Jacksonville University School of Orthodontics - Jacksonville, Florida.

Although the vast majority of TVs are VESA compliant, there are some models that are not. Please consult your TV product manual for more information. Most manuals indicate the exact VESA standard necessary for mounting, or simply indicate the VESA mounts are supported in general. If this is the case, simply purchase a wall mount within the TV size guidelines of your TV.What is VESA?
VESA is a set of standards for the manufacturing of flat screen televisions and PC monitors. Most manufacturers comply with this standard by adhering to an industry wide hole pattern on the back of their displays for mounting purposes.How do I measure my TVs VESA standard?
Look for the 4 mounting holes on the back of your flat screen television. Take both a horizontal and vertical measurement (in mm). This is your VESA Standard. A VESA hole pattern is measured in both horizontal and vertical distance between mounting holes. For example, VESA 75 x 75 means your TV mounting holes are 75mm apart horizontally and 75mm apart vertically.

 Added on : Sunday May 09th 2010 02:40:02 AM There are frequent threads on FW Finance from readers who ask how to send money to various countries from various countries. Generally, the advice is the same - options are bank wire, Paypal, Western Union, or unsecured, unregulated private company.Because they are very safe, I&apos;ve been sticking to international wire transfers from my US bank, but it raised the fee from $20 to $30 earlier this year. On Monday, I want to send a small amount ($100) to the UK, and it&apos;s ridiculous to pay $30 to send $100, so I decided to see what my other options are. I would be willing to try an unregulated private company for a relatively small sum like this.An internet search brings up many companies offering currency transfer, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be an easy way to tell them apart or to compare them.However, I did find some helpful websites, which I thought I&apos;d share with FWF because of the quality of their information:1. http://www.sendmoneyhome.org/Content/about.php
-Started out from a UK perspective, but now covers transactions to/from various countries and currencies.
-Site was initially developed by the UK government&apos;s Department for International Development (making it relatively trustworthy and unbiased), but is now run privately (it probably is still relatively trustworthy, though, since it&apos;s still recommended by UK government websites).
-Allows you to punch in the exact amount of money you want to transfer, and which 2 currencies you are dealing with.
-Checks dozens of companies simultaneously and lets you compare the current exchange rates (updated every 15 minutes), the fees, the time it will take, which countries, etc. -- listing them in a handy chart.
-For example, here is the sending-money-from-the-US page, which at first was kind of hard for me to locate on their website:
http://www.sendmoneyhome.org/money-transfers/Sending_money_from_...
-Their description:
&quot;SendMoneyHome.org is a website that provides consumers with an independent comparison of the best value services offered by Banks, Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), FX providers and prepaid cards for transferring money abroad taking into account their fees, real-time exchange rates, speed and method of transfer. Privately owned by Profile Business Intelligence Ltd (PBI), the site provides detailed information on the various options and methods to find consumers the best deal when sending money abroad.
Launched in March 2005, originally funded and supported by the UK Governments Department for International Development (DFID), the site has already been established as the widest reaching and most comprehensive independent online comparison site for international money transfers and has been described as the benchmark for money transfer comparison sites by the UKs champion for consumers, Martin Lewis (moneysavingexpert.com).
Since September 2008, SendMoneyHome.org has already expanded its offering to a more global audience and is currently the worlds foremost money transfer price comparison service for sending amounts from $10 to $10,000,000 or more.
SendMoneyHome.org was initiated by the UK Governments Department for International Development (DFID), to bring clarity and transparency to the remittances sector for migrant communities living and working in the UK who send money home. Previously, Western Union, MoneyGram, Travelex Money Transfer (now Coinstar) and to a lesser degree banks had a stranglehold on money transfer flows from the UK charging exorbitant fees and offering poor exchange rates. Since its inception, Sendmoneyhome.orgs mandate has been to promote awareness of the other options that are available and provide information about money transfer options that were otherwise not commonly known. This model has worked extremely well in the UK and we are now providing the same comparison model for additional countries - Something that, currently, is clearly absent in many of those countries. Our main longer term goal is to find consumers the best deal wherever they are sending money from and to.
SendMoneyHome.org provides clear, concise comparisons of money transfer services available when sending money from one country to another.&quot;2. http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/foreign-currency-exchan...
-From a UK perspective.
-Though totally UK-focused, it can be worth looking at other topics on this site. I do find the site ugly and somewhat disorganized, but there is good advice, lots of discounts/coupons, etc. He regularly appears on morning news and consumer affairs tv shows in the UK.3. http://www.consumer-action.org/english/articles/how_to_send_mone...
-From a US perspective.
-Consumer Action is a non-profit in San Francisco, CA.
-This guide is for people sending money from the US to another country.
-The guide is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and can be read online or ordered as a print brochure.
-One thing mentioned here that I had not been aware of previously is that the US Postal Service offers a money transfer service to several Latin American countries.4. http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1224.htm...
-From a US perspective.
-For the unusual case of needing to send money to an American citizen abroad who needs &quot;emergency&quot; cash.
-The US State Department will send and hold money for the person at any American consulate or embassy, where the person can pick up the cash. The charge levied by the State Department is $30. They say it&apos;s a one-time service for emergencies only. 5. http://www.moneymadeclear.org.uk/pdfs/sending_money_safely.pdf
-From a UK perspective.
-Governmental publication about how to send money safely when you are not using a safe, regulated bank or credit union to do it. Questions to ask, what to look out for, what to do if things go wrong (if you are British, anyway).6. http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/519/cheapest-foreign-currency...
-From a UK perspective.
-I&apos;m including this link because it goes into detail about &quot;travel money cards&quot; (which might possibly be more typical in the UK than in the US - previously, I&apos;ve not seen these being mentioned as an option for sending foreign currency to someone else, but it makes sense, especially since you can load them with cash *after* the recipient has received the card in the mail).==
For my $100-to-UK-pounds transaction from a US bank account to a UK bank account, sendmoneyhome.org gave me just a few choices (since the total amount I want to send is so small), and the cheapest one was xoom.com. I saw a tv commercial for xoom.com a couple of weeks ago - they apparently charge just $5 for any foreign currency transfer. Since xoom was recommended by sendmoneyhome.org, the amount I want to send is pretty small, and the exchange rate they are listing isn&apos;t terrible, I think I&apos;ll give it a try. ==
Has anyone had good or bad experiences using xoom or other low-fee currency transfer services? Career Thoughts and Compensation - Past, Present, and Future - 2009 Edition 
 Added on : Friday May 07th 2010 06:40:02 PM For the past three years around this time, I started a thread where people could describe all of the ups and downs of their careers, including their level of compensation. I find these threads particularly informative and interesting.I debated whether to start another thread this year. Last year&apos;s thread started off pretty well, but stopped dead in its tracks in February. The other thing I&apos;ve noticed is that most of the people participating and posting in this thread tend to be people who are compensated extraordinarily well. I guess I&apos;m a little guilty of this myself, as I know my salary is above average for my profession. That is not why I started this thread, however. I thought that this thread could be a tremendous resource, especially for people graduating college or looking to switch careers. So, gang, what do you think? Should I continue these threads every year, or should this be the last year we do this? If you participate, please try to keep this a positive, informative thread, and let&apos;s not get into any arguments about how one&apos;s career/education/compensation makes him/her superior/inferior to other people. Contribute as much or as little information as you&apos;re comfortable sharing, but please be honest so that this may serve as a truly informative thread for people mulling their career options.So, now that the ground rules have been set, how did your job go this year? Did things go well or not so well? How well were you compensated for 2009? Did the poor economy have a serious effect on your career? Maybe each person can give a brief description of themselves, their job, their education levels, and their salaries, present and maybe even projected salaries for the future. As always, since I&apos;m starting the thread, I have to bite first:Gender: MaleAge: 37Location: NJOccupation: Urban Educator (My fancy title for a teacher in a city of low socioeconomic standing)Education: M.A., plus 33 additional credits2009 Salary: About $72,000 (70K Base + about $2K for extra activities and a bit of summer work.) This figure is actually a little lower than my total salary last year. My district hasn&apos;t had a contract since the 2007-2008 school year, which has frozen everyone&apos;s salary. However, we will get retroactive pay once the contract is settled. Future Salary Projection: If our contract gets settled, my base salary for this school year (Sep. 2009 - June 2010) should be about $82,000. Next year (2010-2011), it will be around $92,000. Base pay for the 2010 calendar year (Jan. - Dec.) should be about $86,000. Extra work should add on another $2,000 or so, and I&apos;m expecting about $10,000 in retroactive pay. Benefits: Full medical, modest dental, generous sick and personal time, a decent pension plan (for now, more on that later), tremendous job security once you achieve tenure (but virtually none before that, and even with tenure, you can still have the daylights menaced out of you. Also keep in mind that not all states offer tenure, in which case you can pretty much be fired at will no matter how much time you have in a particular district.) What&apos;s the job like?Very difficult. Tremendously long hours, almost no down time during the school day (I don&apos;t take lunch very often),lots of work at home, deplorable working conditions, with some classrooms reaching temperatures of 90+ degrees and others below freezing. Prepare to adopt some small scurrying pets who have made your classroom their home in older buildings in urban districts. You will also most likely need to spend a decent amount of money on supplies for students because your school won&apos;t provide them, even though they insist on your using them. Very little respect and support from most supervisors, parents, and students. I do it for the good kids and because I love teaching.Would you recommend the career to others?It&apos;s getting harder and harder to recommend teaching as a career, especially in an urban district. Each year more and more demands are placed on you, while more resources are taken away from you. There are plenty of people who are ready to tell you you&apos;re a horrible teacher, but these same people won&apos;t tell you why you&apos;re a horrible teacher or how you can improve. My current principal has been good to me, but I&apos;ve been in a situation with a principal who always told me what a horrible teacher I was but refused to tell me what I was doing wrong or how I could make improvements.Some components of our curriculum have reached new levels of madness (and I didn&apos;t think that was possible). Our literacy program , for example, requires students to be in differentiated groups. And within those groups, activities have to be further differentiated for students according to their testing strengths and weaknesses. Oh, and you have to design the center activities.The students have to do these activities independently, but of course, most (especially the younger students) can&apos;t. The facts that we have many students who are unable to read at grade level (or at all) and who have never learned to work cooperatively with other students doesn&apos;t seem to matter to the powers that be.So chaos ensues, with kids in groups playing around and arguing. Meanwhile, you can&apos;t help them or discipline them, because at the same time, you have to meet with another group and assess their reading. This is not a once in a while thing. This is daily. And there&apos;s no other time in the day to help the students learn how to work successfully in groups. Then you have to display work from every subject in your room, with descriptions, evaluations, and state standards. You have to make giant charts for all the skills you&apos;re teaching and display them too. And you can&apos;t make charts or grade papers during the day (unless it&apos;s during a prep or a lunch period, and even both of these periods combined don&apos;t provide nearly enough time to do all this stuff).I also teach computers. We moved to a new building, last year, with new computers. Nearly a year and a half later, the computers STILL don&apos;t work properly. You can imagine how much fun it is to teach computers without properly working computers!If you do decide to become a teacher in NJ, you will be paid well compared to teachers in most other parts of the country. There is, however, an astonishingly wide gap between affluent and needy districts in NJ. NJ&apos;s suburbs are some of the most beautiful in the country, and NJ&apos;s inner cities are some of the toughest in the country. You will earn every dime of the money you make, especially in an urban district. (See above.) In addition, we have a new governor coming in and he&apos;s ready to slash and burn everything related to education. He is no fan of teachers, and he&apos;s ready to slash salaries and benefits if he can. He&apos;s probably not going to get everything he wants, but realistically, pensions will likely be affected somewhat, and eventually all teachers will probably be paying for health benefits. I struggle every day with whether I should start to look for other opportunities. I want to stay to help the truly deserving kids, but the annual increases in the level of nonsense (very little of it having to do with the kids) are making the decision tougher and tougher, despite the good pay.Every year I begin by saying, &quot;It can&apos;t be any crazier than last year. &quot; And every year, it gets crazier. Oh well, hopefully in another 20 years, I can retire! 60% off tuition @ University of Texas [Nursing or Education]

 Added on : Thursday May 06th 2010 01:40:02 PM I got home from work yesterday and found glass all over my dining room table, with a 3 inch bolt laying on the ground. Nothing was missing, but I determined that it was due to the city mowing a greenbelt behind my house due to the following reasons.- the bolt broke through the double-pane window and continued at a approx 20 degree angle to hit a wall and put a dent in my drywall before hitting the floor
- the grass was recently mowed in the greenbelt behind my house (you can still see the mower lines)
- if someone did throw the bolt, they would have to be close to 8 feet tall (if you assume the bolt didn&apos;t change direction after hitting the window)So far I have called the police and filed a report, but getting a bit antsy since they haven&apos;t followed up with me. I am thinking the city will deny and I will have to sue them (out of principle of course) and was wondering if my fellow FW members had any idea of my next step.I was planning on calling the park department of the city (responsible for mowing the lawns) and seeing if I can get them to give me the mowing schedule and when they last mowed the area. I want to get pictures of the mower, showing there is no guard against debris. Anything else helpful? Should I record all telephone conversations with them to catch them telling the truth or lying???I will have pics later tonight. PenFed&apos;s Private Student Loans

Self-organized consumer group for under 50 crowd? 
 Added on : Saturday May 01st 2010 01:00:02 PM We have AARP, the teamsters, the AFL-CIO, and all kinds of other acronyms.I am going to be straight. I hate how much influence AARP exerts. My parents are over 50, and they get some benefits through AARP, like &quot;reduced-rate&quot; car insurance. I question all this &quot;reduced&quot; rates, because I am not sure if they could get cheaper rates by just shopping. In a mathematical sense, proving non-existence is much hard, unless you enumerate every possibility.Also, I sincerely doubt that a lot of the AARP programs are conflict free and truly serve the members. Just look at the slick talking salesman on TV advertizing a &quot;guaranteed life insurance benefit to members&quot;. Yea, right a 10K term life insurance for pennies. A 10K life insurance is like ordering dinner, then letting someone take all the good pieces, and leaving you with the leftover rice and the bread that has already been bitten into.While I don&apos;t think AARP serves in the best interest of its members (at least not always), I absolute hate how much power they think they have (or maybe they actually have). Also, I hate that it is an exclusive group that discriminates on the basis of age (I understand there is nothing illegal about it). And for all of you jumping on me and saying, you can become an associate member, I don&apos;t want to a second class citizen in any group, let alone a nasty group like AARP. Before anyone says why is AARP nasty, I ask the following question: &quot;what has AARP done for me lately&quot;? And before anyone thinks this is just my personal blog on which I am ranting against AARP, let me get straight to the first business of the day.I want a membership based organization that will look after the interests of people like me. You might ask, who does that include and what do you get out of it?1. Minimum age 26 or 28,2. Maximum age 50 (unless you explicitly forgo joining AARP, and you prove every year that you are not a member. Too burdensome? Take a hike.),3. Minimum income: $75K. Too high? Too bad. But if you do legitimately think that this level is not high enough, we can have a sliding scale that is pegged to the median salary in an MSA, or even a more narrowly defined geographical division,4. Maximum income: maybe the level at which AMT exemptions end. Why such a condition? Well, we like it if you are doing well, but we don&apos;t like it if you are filthy rich. If you are filthy rich, perhaps a country club membership is better. Also, we firmly believe that beyond some level income, there is a persistent deterioration of moral judgement, and thinkin as part of a larger group,5. Minimum education: we can be flexible here, but we want to be somewhat exclusive while also being inclusive. E.g., we would admit people with AA degrees who are successful RNs, earning at the top of their range. We are also willing to accept college rejects like Bill Gates, if he wishes to join, and if he forgos his membership in the AARP,I am sure that some of the more creative and clever members will chip in with more suggestions.Now, why would we want to have such a consumer organization? A few reasons:A. Negotiation power for all kinds of products, e.g., insurance, travel, consumer durables,B. Election lobby. I understand that the impact here might be small, because of the way US elections work (e.g., on a national basis, you might have a lot of members, but there are no true national elections in US, even at the executive office level).But think of creative ways that election and campaing laws can be bent, and think of the purchasing power of this group&apos;s members vs. say the general public.C. Standing up against the employees. That&apos;s right, I said it, you heard it here loud and clear. Most people in US, even the middle-income, or upper-middle income, are getting pushed by employees all the time. If you don&apos;t think this is true, then you are a sleeping lamb, snoozing sheep, or any other naive animal. Seriously, the corporations really push their employees around. They don&apos;t push you when you are strong, climbing the ladder, or have influence. They push you around when you are sick, when you are having difficulty (family, health, personal reasons, etc).Membership fees will be high and are not for the faint of heart. Nothing molecular like the $16 / year for AARP. I am thinking something more substantive like $500 / year. If you guys think that is too low, I am willing to go to $1000 / year.What do you get in exchange for this? Well, you get A, B, C above, and more. But at the end of the day, you get a true consumer advocate in every sense of the word.Would appreciate your thoughts and ideas.

 Added on : Friday April 30th 2010 07:30:02 PM In the spirit of my other thread, let&apos;s discuss products that you should almost always pay full price for.I&apos;ll start with a few:1) Restaurant Food Service. If you try to haggle or bust out coupons before the meal begins, they may spit in your food.2) Louis Vuitton items. They NEVER run sales in store, and anything you buy outside of a licensed store is likely a knockoff. Of course if you are OK with a non-genuine item then this doesnt apply. I imagine this is the same for Gucci and a few other high end brands.3) Contractor Work From Sole Proprietors. There may be some wiggle room in negotiation, but if you are dealing directly with the contractor, such as a plumber who owns his own business, and you piss him off, he may do a half-assed job because he is rushing through it due to not enough profit. But if you pay full price and don&apos;t complain, he will probably make sure he takes very good care of your work. You need to know the market rate for that type of labor so you are getting hosed, but once it&apos;s established that it is fair, just pay it. I say this from experience of having family members in this business who will do crap work if you piss them off.4) Graduate Degrees: MBA and JD specifically. Pay full price and go to a Tier 1 school rather than less price for a tier 2 or worse school. Tramontina Gourmet Cast Iron Covered Red Casserole ($39.00 was $129.99) @ Amazon
