 Taking orders - you have to deal with the rude customers.

 I worked at McDonald&apos;s for 2 years and I would say drive-thru would be the hardest position. The grill area is hard to learn, but once you learn it, it&apos;s not so bad. On grill you just have to be fast and listen if anyone tells you to do anything. On drive-thru (when it&apos;s busy) you have to seriously multitask. The back booth person will order take, while collecting money at the window and doing various miscellaneous things. The front person makes drinks, hands out food and is constantly at a fast pace. It&apos;s easy to get distracted and loose focus and when you&apos;re handing things out if you don&apos;t check the bags, you get in trouble for it. Then again, the lobby area is hard too because you&apos;re constantly doing something. Most of the time it&apos;s not very enjoyable.
People seriously don&apos;t understand how much WORK the people who work at fast food restaurants are required to do. Hopefully people who eat at them will become educated and use manners.

 I&apos;ve always thought the hardest position was being a cashier and drive-thru during breakfast and lunch Dealing with unruly customers is the worst.

Working in the back as a cook doesn&apos;t seem like its too stressful, not like cashier where everyone is watching you the whole time, waiting for their order.

When I worked at Papa Johns my favorite was being on the pizza line and making the pies. Being busy wasn&apos;t a problem on the line, sure I was stress some times but I didn&apos;t have to deal with customers. Look up at the order screen and make what its says. If I screwed up, the complaints and yelling went to the cashiers, not me. I hated front counters and telephone orders (I especially hated telephone orders. Tele orders people were the most indecisive and took the longest time ordering). Stay on the phone to long with customers and I get flake from the manager (our systems times the calls. It suppose to take no more than two min for someone to place an order, anything longer than that, the manager was all over you). Tele orders on busy days sucks.

So, sure it may be a bit stressful cooking the orders in the back by yourself but at least your not dealing with customers who always seem to be in a hurry.

I choose the back.

 There are different things you will do, some you will like and some you will hate. Thinking and acting quickly are skills that you will master, even if it doesn&apos;t seem like it now. But dealing with customers is something else altogether. Most will not make much impression, but there are a few who will make your job very challenging! Angry, unreasonable people can really ruin your day. But smile, be polite and know that you are better than that. People joke about being a fast food worker, but dealing with fast food customers can be an art in itself. I think learning how to deal with people was the best skill I learned in fast food.

 omg thats so weird today was my first day working at mcd&apos;s and i had kitchen and its deff worst than some drive thru..i wish i was there. my reasoning: there are over twenty sandwiches/wraps that you have to remember how to make. theres three types of meat and a bunch of diff boxes and paper wrappers for each item. you have to know how to wrap the item and pay very close attention to the monitor. a costumer can switch up what they want from a normal order to a special in less than ten seconds and it kinda throws you off. also speed and neatness is a great part of the kitchen so if you a pretty slow your gonna feel out of place as ppl watch and wait. ugh second day tomoro BUT i cant say it was fun and you learn a lot in little time

 Cleaning the sludge outta the fryer. Cleaning up sum1&apos;s rectal rocket. Havin to multi-task all the things u say u have to do. Goin home smelling like grease&amp;having it come outta ur pores b/c it gets so ingrained in u. And sometimes the hardest of all is when u have to do it all w/ a big smile on ur face:D But I do commend u greatly for havin a job,&amp;1 in which that people don&apos;t realize how hard it really can be til they walk in ur shoes. So good luck dude
