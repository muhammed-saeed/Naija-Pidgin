 HCG Fat Loss &gt; HCG Diet FAQ 
  
 
 Chapter 6 
 Frequently 
Asked Questions 
 
 The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It 
isn&apos;t. The FDA is protecting the profits of the corporations that pay us and the 
politicians! 
- Herbert Ley, M.D., Former FDA Commissioner 


 Where do I get HCG? What if I just did the diet in Phase 2 without the HCG injections? Can I start the program with Phase 2 without doing any of the things in Phase 1? Do I have to do Phase 3? What if I cannot get HCG and cannot do Phase 2? What does the FDA say about HCG? Is HCG legal for use in a weight loss regime? My doctor says that this won&apos;t work and is not safe. Are there doctors and clinics using this treatment now? Isn&apos;t 500 calories a day too low to be safe? During the diet in Phase 2 will I have vitamin, mineral, or other nutritional deficiencies due to low food consumption? Have any changes been made to the original Simeons &quot;weight loss cure protocol&quot;? Why was the Simeons &quot;weight loss cure protocol&quot; kept a secret and why don&apos;t food companies, drug companies, and the government want us to know the truth about its effectiveness and safety? What are your sources for the information in this book? Isn&apos;t obesity just caused by overeating? Could it be that I actually have a fear or reluctance of losing weight? Does the weight loss cure protocol get rid of cellulite? How do I prepare and inject HCG? Must I gorge for the first two days in Phase 2? How do I measure the 100 grams of protein? Can I substitute smoked fish, pickled fish, or deli meats? Can I mix vegetables? Can&apos;t I change some food items on the diet? Can I eat lamb, pork, shellfish, duck, or venison while on the 500 calorie Phase 2 diet? Will I be hungry during this protocol? Can I use artificial sweeteners while on this protocol? Can I use MSG (monosodium glutamate)? Can I swim or use hot tubs? While on the protocol can I use gum, mints, lozenges, or cough syrup? If I&apos;m not hungry while doing Phase 2, do I still have to eat everything as described? What if I cheat on the diet during Phase 2? What if I have low energy or hunger during Phase 2? Can I drink juices while doing the protocol? What about human growth hormone, testosterone, or other hormone treatments? Can I take apple cider vinegar tablets instead of the liquid? Must I eat breakfast as well as eating six times per day? Can I eat salt? The instructions in all the phases call for a large consumption of water and teas. Is this necessary? Must I eliminate cosmetics, moisturizers, lotions, and creams during Phase 2? What about abdominal exercises and aerobics? What if I have problems sleeping? What about all these diet pills, patches, and products that claim to burn fat, reduce hunger, increase metabolism, block carbs, etc.? What about all these doctors and celebrities who endorse weight loss products or various food products? After I do Phase 1, 2, and 3 should I continue weighing myself every day? Will this protocol restore structural fat that may have been lost during years of severe yo-yo dieting? Will I gain the weight back? If the weight comes back can I do this protocol again? What if the food label says &quot;all natural&quot;? Should I buy food that says &quot;diet&quot;, &quot;lite&quot;, &quot;low fat&quot;, &quot;low carb&quot;, &quot;fat free&quot;, etc.? What if I&apos;m skeptical and nervous about using this protocol? Do I really need to eat organic grass fed beef, organic poultry, and organic milk, cheese, and dairy products? Why are fast food, and regional and chain restaurants so bad? Will you be setting up clinics around the world offering this protocol? Do you have any recipes that work with the protocol? What if I show no weight loss four days in a row while on Phase 2? Can I do Phase 1 for longer than thirty days? Can I take higher doses of HCG? Can I stay on Phase 2 longer than six weeks? What if I&apos;m vegetarian? What if I&apos;m really stressed? Is buying food in bulk a good idea? What about homogenized dairy products? Why are the majority of children today fat starting at birth? Any suggestions for eating in restaurants? What if I have only ten pounds to lose? When the FDA, AMA, or FTC says a medical treatment or drug is effective and safe, or ineffective and dangerous, aren&apos;t they usually correct in their statements? Do medical boards, the AMA, FDA, or other organizations really suppress effective cures that could help people? Weren&apos;t you sued by the Federal Trade Commission and called a habitual false advertiser? Should I read your first two books? Do thoughts play a role in obesity? Is the media really biased? Do electromagnetic frequencies really affect our cells and cause weight gain? Do governments and corporations really work together to make us fat? Can you define &quot;homemade&quot; or &quot;made from scratch&quot;? Do food companies really lie to us about their products just to make money? Do drugs really make us fat? You&apos;re not a doctor. How can I feel good about your dos and don&apos;ts in Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4?

 What if I just did the diet in Phase 2 without the HCG injections? 

Many double-blind studies have been conducted that give the answer to this 
 question. If you just do the diet in Phase 2 without the hCG injections, 
 you will, in fact, lose weight. The problem is, during the diet you will 
 be hungry and tired; most importantly, you will be losing muscle and 
 structural fat; you will not lose any of the abnormal fat deposits in the 
 problem areas. Your body will not be reshaped and re-sculpted. When you 
 finish the diet your metabolism will be lower than before and your hunger 
 higher than before. You will not have achieved the results you want. Back to top 
 

 Can I start the program with Phase 2 without doing any of the things in Phase 1? 

Yes. However, if you do not do Phase 1 to at least some degree, you will 
 not be handling and addressing many of the new causes of your overweight 
 condition. Doing as much as you can of the Phase 1 steps will accelerate 
 the process and make permanent weight loss easier to achieve. In today&apos;s 
 world, the steps outlined in Phase 1 absolutely are recommended if you 
 want to eliminate food cravings, increase metabolism, reduce hunger, and 
 keep the weight off forever. Back to top 
 

 Do I have to do Phase 3? 

Yes. Phase 2 and Phase 3 are, in fact, the original Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol .&quot;Phase 3 is necessary to stabilize your weight and reset 
 the hypothalamus so that the weight does not come back. It is vitally 
 important that you follow Phase 2 and Phase 3 exactly as described. You 
 must strictly adhere to Simeons&apos; instructions in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Back to top 
 

 What if I cannot get HCG and cannot do Phase 2? 

If hCG is completely unavailable to you there is an option. First, do ALL 
 the steps in Phase 1 for thirty days. Then, you replace Phase 2 with the 
 The Turbo Protein Diet as described in the book written by Dieter Markert. 
 This protocol uses a product called Almased, available at (800) 256-2733 
 or www.almased.com . 
 Do this protocol for up to six weeks. Then, continue with Phase 3 and 
 Phase 4 exactly as described. This protocol is not as effective as the 
 Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol &quot;with hCG. However, it is the next best alternative. If 
 you do this protocol you must do all the steps in Phase 1 and you must do 
 the Candida cleanse, liver cleanse, and parasite cleanse in Phase 4 in 
 order to achieve the same results. Back to top 
 

 What does the FDA say about HCG? 

The FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and even the manufacturers of 
 hCG themselves state,&quot;HCG has no known affect on fat mobilization, 
 reducing appetite or sense of hunger, or body fat distribution.&quot;They 
 further state,&quot;HCG has not been demonstrated to be an effective adjunct 
 therapy in the treatment of obesity and does not increase fat losses 
 beyond that resulting from caloric restriction.&quot;They even say 
 specifically that,&quot;HCG should never be used in the treatment of obesity 
 because serious problems can occur.&quot;These statements are blatantly and 
 flagrantly false. There is absolutely no documentation or substantiation 
 backing up and proving that these negative statements are true. The 
 studies that the government uses to backup these lies were conducted as 
 part of the massive cover-up of the truth about the Simeons&quot;weight loss 
 cure protocol.&quot;In these studies the researchers purposely caused the 
 results to be negative. First, they did not follow the Simeons protocol 
 exactly as instructed. Dr. Simeons was very clear that if the protocol was 
 not followed exactly and precisely as described, the results would not be 
 achieved. The researchers changed the specific mentioned food items to 
 other items claiming that the calories were similar; therefore, would not 
 affect the results. This was a fatal flaw. Most importantly, the 
 researchers mixed the hCG solution weeks in advance before giving the 
 daily injections to the patients. Simeons was very clear that hCG should 
 be mixed daily. It cannot be mixed and stored for later use. Once hCG is 
 mixed it begins to lose potency very quickly. Within twenty-four hours the 
 potency of the hCG is completely gone. Therefore, the injections were 
 completely useless. In effect, the test subjects were receiving no hCG at 
 all. The studies showed that all people on the diet lost weight, therefore 
 concluding that the hCG injections had no positive effects.

The truth is that in all properly conducted studies, people on the diet 
 without hCG and people on the diet with hCG did, in fact, both lose 
 weight. However, in these properly controlled studies, the group receiving 
 the hCG with the diet lost more weight, had no hunger, and more 
 importantly, lost dramatically more inches. The hCG group saw a dramatic 
 reshaping and re-sculpting of their bodies. The hCG group lost fat in the 
 problem areas. The FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and the drug 
 companies are simply lying to us in order to protect the profits of the 
 food companies, the pharmaceutical companies, and the diet industry. Back to top 
 

 Is HCG legal for use in a weight loss regime? 

It all depends on what country you live in! In America the FDA makes the 
 erroneous statement that hCG should never be used in the treatment of 
 obesity. They are adamant about this I have talked to dozens of officers 
 at the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and various other 
 government agencies. I asked why they were so adamant about making sure 
 people did not use hCG in the Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol .&quot;No one could give me a straight answer. No one could 
 provide me any documentation or substantiation proving that the Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol ,&quot;used exactly as described, was unsafe. This is a great 
 cover up as to the true causes and cure for the obesity epidemic The FDA 
 and other government agencies are protecting the profits of the 
 pharmaceutical companies as they work to get approval on a number of 
 expensive, ineffective surgical procedures and patented drugs to be sold 
 for the treatment of obesity. As the past commissioner of the FDA, Dr. 
 Herbert Ley, stated,&quot;The FDA is not protecting people. It protects the 
 profits of the pharmaceutical companies.&quot;In 1962, the Journal of the 
 American Medical Association warned people against the Simeons protocol 
 stating,&quot;Adherence to such a drastic regime is potentially more hazardous 
 to the patient&apos;s health than continued obesity.&quot;This has been proven to 
 be a false, unsubstantiated statement. In 1974, the Food and Drug 
 Administration required producers of hCG to label the drug with a warning 
 against using it for weight loss or fat redistribution. Interestingly 
 enough, no one has ever come out with a clear definitive statement that 
 the use of hCG as part of the exact Simeons protocol was ineffective or 
 dangerous. It is true that hCG should never be used to treat obesity 
 alone. It must only be used as part of the exact Simeons protocol. 
 According to the FDA, it is in fact legal for doctors in America to 
 prescribe medications for purposes that are not approved by the FDA. This 
 suggests that doctors in America can prescribe hCG to be used as part of 
 the Simeons protocol, even though this purpose has not been approved by 
 the FDA. Back to top 
 

 My doctor says that this won&apos;t work and is not safe. 

Find another doctor. If your doctor has not personally treated patients 
 using the Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol &quot;exactly and precisely as instructed, how would he know 
 whether the protocol was effective and safe? Thousands of medical doctors 
 around the world over the last thirty years have treated hundreds of 
 thousands of patients. The success rate is almost 100%. There has never 
 been a single patient that has been reported to have any negative side 
 effects during or after the Simeons&quot;weight loss cure protocol&quot;was 
 administered. The safety and efficacy of this protocol is absolutely 
 without question. There is not one bit of evidence showing that even a 
 single patient has had any negative side effects as long as they have done 
 the Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol &quot;precisely and accurately as described. Thousands of 
 medical doctors all can&apos;t be wrong. Hundreds of thousands of patients all 
 can&apos;t be hallucinating about their successful fat reduction and weight 
 loss. I personally did this program and, like hundreds of thousands of 
 other successful patients, can attest that everything about it is true. Back to top 
 

 Are there doctors and clinics using this treatment now? 

Yes. I have personally talked to numerous medical doctors around the world 
 who are currently treating patients with the Simeons&quot;weight loss cure 
 protocol.&quot;Because of the overwhelming desire by the pharmaceutical 
 industry, food industry, and various government agencies to suppress the 
 truth about this obesity cure, most of these doctors asked not to be 
 mentioned by name in this book. Doing so would subject them to persecution 
 and possible prosecution for curing obesity in patients. At www.naturalcures.com I will be listing doctors and clinics around the world that are 
 administering the Simeons&quot;weight loss cure protocol.&quot;One fearless doctor 
 using this method is Dr. Daniel Belluscio, M.D. For most of Dr. 
 Belluscio&apos;s medical career, he has been devoted to the study of hCG and 
 the Simeons method for weight loss. He spent many years at the Bellevue 
 Klinik in Switzerland, an institution with one of the most impressive 
 records of using hCG in the treatment of obesity. He has traveled 
 extensively, lecturing on IICG and obesity in the U.S.A., Sweden, Italy, 
 Germany, and Israel. He has published several reports on the method for 
 health care practitioners and articles on the subject for the general 
 public. In 1987, Dr. Belluscio founded the hCG Research Clinic, an 
 institution for obesity research. Records show that the clinic has used 
 the hCG approached on over 6,500 patients to date. This reliable and 
 effective method for obesity management has been validated by appropriate 
 double-blind studies. Information on this clinic is available at www.hcgobesity.org . Back to top 
 

 Isn&apos;t 500 calories a day too low to be safe? 

No. Research now confirms that eating very low calorie diets actually 
 increase overall health, have anti-aging effects, and increase lifespan. 
 This was reported recently in The New York Times. Most importantly, 
 however, is when you are doing the diet combined with the hCG injections, 
 your body is being flooded with over 2,000 calories of nutrition from the 
 releasing of the abnormal fat reserves. This is one of the reasons that 
 during Phase 2, consisting of the diet and hCG injections, you are not 
 hungry and generally have an increase in energy levels. Back to top 


 During the diet in Phase 2 will I have vitamin, mineral, or other nutritional deficiencies due to low food consumption? 

No. During the three- to six-week Phase 2 period your body is releasing 
 massive amounts of stored nutrition from the fat cells that are being 
 synthesized. Extensive studies have been conducted on patients throughout 
 the protocol proving that no nutritional deficiencies develop. Therefore, 
 during Phase 2 you should not be consuming anything other than those 
 listed in the instructions. This includes no vitamin, mineral, or food 
 supplements. Back to top 


 Have any changes been made to the original Simeons &quot;weight loss cure protocol&quot;? 

Phases 2 and 3 are, in fact, the original instructions as described in 
 Simeons&apos; manuscript Pounds and Inches: A New Approach to Obesity. There 
 are two exceptions. Simeons used 125 IE of hCG. He suggested that taking 
 larger amounts do not improve results, but rather have the opposite 
 effect. Doctors in the 1970s and 1980s began dealing with patients who had 
 many more issues and causes of abnormal hypothalamus activity than Simeons 
 dealt with. Therefore, after Simeons&apos; death in 1970, doctors began 
 researching with slightly higher amounts of hCG. It was found that between 
 175 and 200 IEs were the optimal daily doses. Remember, this is an 
 incredibly small amount of hCG. During pregnancy women are flooded with 
 over 300,000 IEs of hCG on a daily basis. Doctors routinely administer 
 6,000 or more lEs of hCG to patients with various medical conditions 
 Taking 125 to 200 IEs daily for three to six weeks is an incredibly small 
 amount. How much you should take should be determined between you and your 
 doctor. The minimum is 125 IEs, as Simeons originally instructed, and the 
 maximum should be no more than 200 IEs.

The second modification to Simeons&apos; original protocol is the exclusion of 
 melba toast, or an Italian grissino breadstick with lunch and dinner. It 
 has been found that by eliminating the small melba toast or grissino 
 breadstick from the lunch and dinner meals speeds up the fat burning 
 process. Simeons also did not include Phase 1 or Phase 4 of the current 
 protocol. This is because all of the issues that are addressed in Phase 1 
 and Phase 4 did not exist in the 1950s and 1960s when Simeons was treating 
 patients. Back to top 
 

 Why was the Simeons &quot;weight loss cure protocol&quot; kept a secret and why don&apos;t food companies, drug companies, and the government want us to know the truth about its effectiveness and safety? 

It was kept secret because the doctors who are using the treatment 
 successfully know full-well that they will be criticized, debunked, 
 persecuted, and prosecuted for curing people of their obesity. Remember, 
 the more overweight, fat, and obese people there are, the more money the 
 drug companies, the food companies, and the diet industry companies make. 
 It&apos;s pure economics. It&apos;s all about money and profits. These companies 
 will go to the greatest lengths of deception and fraud to increase their 
 profits. A prime example of the deceit and fraud these companies partake 
 in is the recent initiative brokered by former president Bill Clinton with 
 soft drink manufacturers and school systems. President Clinton announced 
 that he had brokered a deal with the soft drink manufacturers that would 
 help fight obesity and promote health in school children. His announcement 
 was that the soft drink manufacturers would no longer be selling soft 
 drinks in schools through vending machines and at school lunch programs. 
 This was supposed to help reduce the large consumption of sugar contained 
 in soft drinks This sounds like a wonderful thing. It was made to appear 
 that the soft drink companies were losing profits and were sincerely 
 interested in helping fight obesity in school age children. This is a 
 great lie and deception. What they didn&apos;t tell you is that the number of 
 soft drink vending machines in the schools continues to increase. The 
 number of soft drink dispensers in school lunch programs continues to 
 increase. The most significant thing they did not tell you was that diet 
 sodas will continue to be sold and served to our children! This is a huge 
 profit windfall for the soft drink manufacturers. Soft drink companies 
 want to sell more diet sodas than regular sodas. Why? Diet sodas are 
 cheaper to make and are more profitable. Diet sodas contain artificial 
 sweeteners, including NutraSweet and Splenda, that are physically, 
 chemically addicting. Diet sodas also increase depression and obesity. 
 Diet sodas are being called the new crack. Soft drink manufacturers are 
 popping the Champagne over this initiative. They are like crack cocaine 
 dealers, selling their product to young school children, getting them 
 physically and chemically addicted and creating a life-long consumer who 
 cannot stop consuming their products. The drug companies, the food 
 companies, and the diet industry companies do not want you to know the 
 truth about the safety and effectiveness of the Simeons&quot; weight 
loss cure protocol &quot;because it absolutely will cost them huge profits. They 
 are so fearful about this information becoming accepted that they are 
 paying lobbyists tens of millions of dollars to get lawmakers to enact 
 legislation that will stop this information being disseminated and used by 
 the masses. Additionally, this information is blowing the whistle and 
 exposing the dirty secrets about how the food industry is purposefully 
 designing and creating food that makes us physically, chemically addicted, 
 increase our hunger and appetites, and actually make us fat! Exposing how 
 the food companies are purposefully creating the obesity epidemic, it is 
 putting great fear in the executives who could face massive multibillion 
 class action suits from angry citizens who have been duped, lied to, and 
 deceived by these multinational publicly traded corporations. Back to top 


 What are your sources for the information in this book? 

I have traveled over five million miles researching non-drug and 
 non-surgical ways to cure and prevent disease. My research and 
 investigations have been going on for over twenty years. I am not a 
 medical doctor, and have no formal medical training. I am simply reporting 
 to you the facts as an investigative journalist. I have interviewed over 
 5,000 medical doctors and health care practitioners around the world. I 
 have read over 1,000 books on various health subjects. I have interviewed 
 hundreds of authors who have focused on various areas of health care. I 
 have dozens of inside sources at the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control, 
 the FTC, the National Institutes of Health, and other state and federal 
 agencies who provide me inside, top secret information. I have inside 
 sources at dozens of pharmaceutical companies, food companies, and diet 
 industry companies that have supplied me with massive amounts of secret 
 documents. I have personally been involved, on a covert basis, with 
 pharmaceutical companies and government agencies around the world. I have 
 interviewed thousands of patients who have gone through these various 
 protocols. I have reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of scientific 
 documents, studies, and doctor/ patient records. I have personally done 
 this protocol myself and have the best firsthand experience on reporting 
 it to you. Back to top 


 Isn&apos;t obesity just caused by overeating? 

No. Dr. Simeons states in his manuscript that most obese patients do not 
 suffer from compulsive overeating; they suffer genuine hunger. This real, 
 gnawing, torturing hunger has nothing to do whatever with compulsive 
 overeating. Sudden desires for sweets are a result of Candida yeast 
 overgrowth and from the subconscious knowledge that highly refined food 
 will relieve the hunger faster than any other kind of food. Compulsive 
 overeating differs fundamentally from the obese patient&apos;s actual genuine 
 hunger and real greater need for food. Compulsive overeating can be a 
 frightening, ugly spectacle to behold. The mechanisms causing this 
 reaction are entirely beyond the patient&apos;s control. These eating frenzies 
 are also caused by the mental triggers and hypnotic suggestions implanted 
 in our minds by the food companies&apos; coercive television, radio, and print 
 advertising. The solution to this condition is the LifeForce Plan, 
 comprehensive Candida cleanse, a complete and comprehensive colon cleanse, 
 liver cleanse, parasite cleanse, and heavy metal detox. The Purification 
 Program is also a required course of treatment that will help alleviate 
 the physical and biological causes of this disorder. www.purification.org or www.clearbodyclearmind.com . Handling nutritional deficiencies via 
 whole food supplementation is also required. Stress reduction by taking 
 AlphaCalm and listening to stress reducing CDs also are needed. 
 Deprogramming the mind by reading books that expose the coercive nature of 
 advertising is an effective solution to the hypnotic triggers that we 
 carry with us. In Simeons&apos; time people suffering from compulsive eating 
 disorders constituted less than 2% of patients. Today estimates vary 
 between 30% and 50% of all obese individuals suffer from this disorder. Back to top 
 

 Could it be that I actually have a fear or reluctance of losing weight? 

Dr. Simeons stated that some patients are consciously or unconsciously 
 deeply attached to their fat and cannot bear the thought of losing it. 
 Some people have subconsciously worked out a pattern in life in which 
 their obesity plays a determining role, and then become subconsciously 
 reluctant to upset this pattern and face a new kind of life which will be 
 entirely different when their bodies have become normal and very 
 attractive. This condition can be corrected. One known recommended 
 technology for this and other mental and emotional issues, as well as 
 psychosomatic illness, is Dianetics. www.dianetics.com . Back to top 


 Does the weight loss cure protocol get rid of cellulite? 

In most cases, absolutely yes! If you are very strict and fully commit to 
 all of the dos and don&apos;ts in Phase 1, complete a full course of treatment 
 in Phases 2 and 3, and partake in all the suggestions in Phase 4, 
 cellulite can vanish completely in a one- to six-month period of time. Back to top 
 

 How do I prepare and inject HCG? 

HCG is available by prescription only. It is a pure substance extracted 
 from the urine of pregnant women. The form that is to be used in this 
 protocol is human chorionic gonadotrophin, not any animal form. It should 
 come as a highly soluble powder. These preparations are carefully 
 standardized, and any brand made by a reliable, approved pharmaceutical 
 company is acceptable. The hCG should be extracted from the urine and not 
 from the placenta. It must be of human and not animal origin. In fake, 
 false, and misleading studies done around the world, animal hCG or hCG 
 from the placenta was used, which will, of course, not work. The powder 
 should be sealed in small ampoules where the amount is stated in 
 international units. Be sure to check the date of manufacture and expiry. 
 Once the date of expiry has passed, the hCG becomes useless. A suitable 
 solvent solution is always supplied in a separate ampoule in the same 
 package. Once the hCG powder is mixed with the solution it must be used 
 within a few hours. Some say that the hCG will stay fully potent for two 
 to three days after mixing. There is debate about whether this take the 
 injection of hCG immediately upon mixing it into a solution. HCG, when 
 injected, produces little if any tissue reaction. It is completely 
 painless, and in the many thousands of injections Simeons has given he has 
 never seen a negative reaction at the site of the injection. The injection 
 is done deep intragluteally in the outer upper quadrant of the buttocks. 
 Ideally the injection should not be given into the superficial fat layers, 
 but should reach the muscle. It is important that the daily injection be 
 taken at the same time each morning. Always do these injections while 
 under the care and supervision of a medical doctor. HCG mixing instructions are available here. Back to top 
 

 Must I gorge for the first two days in Phase 2? 

Yes. Dr. Simeons states that a person will not be comfortable on the 500 
 calorie diet unless his normal fat reserves are reasonably well stocked. 
 It is for this reason that in every case a person must eat to capacity the 
 most fattening food they can get down for the first two days in Phase 2. 
 It is a fundamental mistake to start the 500 calorie diet as soon as hCG 
 injections are started as it seems to take about three injections before 
 abnormal fat deposits begin to get released and circulate, thus becoming 
 available to the body as fuel. Back to top 


 How do I measure the 100 grams of protein? 

Use a highly accurate small kitchen scale. Always weigh the protein raw. Back to top 


 Can I substitute smoked fish, pickled fish, or deli meats? 

Absolutely not. Nothing smoked, dried, or pickled. Never use deli meats. 
 The meats must be of the leanest variety, trimming off any and all visible 
 fat. The meat must be 100% organic otherwise it will contain growth 
 hormone, antibiotics, and other animal drugs which slowdown or stop the 
 fat burning process. Farm raised fish should never be used as these are 
 loaded with man-made chemicals and food dyes which will slow down or stop 
 the fat burning process. Simeons was very specific that grass fed beef and 
 veal be used, otherwise the animals were fed genetically modified grain 
 and animal parts, creating an abnormally high fat content and fat marbling 
 of the beef and veal. Eating beef and veal that is not grass fed and 100% 
 organic will slow down or stop the fat burning process. The amounts must 
 be extremely accurate. One hundred grams is 100 grams! Back to top 
 

 Can I mix vegetables? 

No, with one exception. You can make a salad consisting of various organic 
 lettuces, organic cabbage, organic spinach, organic celery, organic 
 onions, organic cucumbers, organic radishes, and organic tomatoes. Season 
 with organic raw apple cider vinegar, or the juice of one-half an organic 
 lemon. Add sea salt, black pepper, crushed garlic, in any amounts of dried 
 or fresh organic herbs. It&apos;s delicious and filling! Back to top 
 

 Can&apos;t I change some food items on the diet? 

No. You must be very strict in following the diet exactly if you want to 
 achieve results. Simeons was very particular in his research about how 
 even the smallest change or variation would slow down or stop the fat 
 burning process completely. He said that the diet used in conjunction with 
 the hCG injections must not exceed 500 calories per day. He also stated 
 that the way these calories are made up is of the utmost important. He 
 pointed out that if a patient dropped the apple and had a little more 
 protein he would not be getting any more calories, but he would not lose 
 weight. There are a number of foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, 
 which have the same or even lower caloric values than those listed as 
 permissible. However, when substitutions are made Simeons found that they 
 interfere with the regular loss of weight under hCG. This is due to the 
 nature of their chemical compositions. Simeons also noted that beef in 
 Europe was quite different than beef from America. If it&apos;s not on the list 
 do not eat it. Back to top 
 

 Can I eat lamb, pork, shellfish, duck, or venison while on the 500 calorie Phase 2 diet? 

No. Back to top 
 

 Will I be hungry during this protocol? 

During Phase 1 you can never be hungry because there is no restriction on 
 the amount of food you eat. In Phase 2 you may have slight hunger between 
 one and seven days. This will depend on how much of Phase 1 you did. 
 During Phase 3 you cannot be hungry because there is no limit to the 
 amount of food you consume. In Phase 4 you can never be hungry because the 
 hypothalamus has now been reset, lowering your natural hunger and there 
 are no limits to the amount of food you consume. Do not be fearful of this 
 program because you are horrified at the thought of enduring torturous 
 hunger. Like the hundreds of thousands of other people who have gone 
 through this protocol, you will find the process enjoyable and relatively 
 easy. Back to top 


 Can I use artificial sweeteners while on this protocol? 

No. You should never use any artificial sweeteners ever again for as long 
 as you live. All artificial sweeteners, including NutraSweet and Splenda, 
 should never be consumed. They increase depression, are physically, 
 chemically addicting, and they make you fat. Back to top 


 Can I use MSG (monosodium glutamate)? 

No. You should never eat anything with MSG in it ever again as long as you 
 live. It is a deadly, dangerous excitotoxin. It increases depression, 
 increases appetite, and makes you fat. Back to top 


 Can I swim or use hot tubs? 

Although swimming is fantastic exercise, I do not recommend it because 
 almost all swimming pools today are loaded with deadly chlorine. All tap 
 water is loaded with chlorine and fluoride. Swimming pools and hot tubs 
 have additional chlorine and other poisonous chemicals added to them. The 
 skin is the largest organ in the body. Being in a swimming pool or hot tub 
 means you are flooding your bloodstream and body cells with deadly 
 chlorine, fluoride, and other poisonous chemicals. These chemicals, once 
 on your skin and in your body, create hormonal imbalances leading to a 
 host of problems including depression, PMS, digestive disorders, and 
 obesity. I have a swimming pool and hot tub; however, no chlorine or any 
 chemicals are used. The water has been filtered through ultraviolet light, 
 granular activated charcoal impregnated with silver, and other organic 
 filtering material. It is kept clean, with infusing of ozone and oxygen. 
 It is actually super healthy to drink the water, never mind swim in it! 
 Swimming in the ocean or lakes is highly beneficial and recommended. Watch 
 out, however, as certain natural water sources can be heavily polluted. Back to top 
 

 While on the protocol can I use gum, mints, lozenges, or cough syrup? 

No, no, no, no! Back to top 
 

 If I&apos;m not hungry while doing Phase 2, do I still have to eat everything as described? 

Yes. Whether you&apos;re hungry or not, you must eat the lunch and dinner in 
 their complete form. You cannot have one big meal per day. You may take 
 the apple from either lunch or dinner and eat it at breakfast. No other 
 changes or substitutions are allowed as they slow or stop the fat burning 
 process. Back to top 


 What if I cheat on the diet during Phase 2? 

If you do cheat for a meal or for one or two days in a row, all it means 
 is that the weight loss process will stop for a few days or a temporary 
 slight increase in weight may occur. Immediately start the diet again at 
 the next meal and carry on. If you cheat on a meal every other day, you 
 are wasting your time. Back to top 
 

 What if I have low energy or hunger during Phase 2? 

Some patients may be dealing with insulin resistance or low blood sugar. 
 The solution is to make sure you are drinking Eleotin tea as the 
 instructions dictate. Make sure at breakfast you drink organic Yerba Mate 
 tea. Drink several cups of organic Yerba Mate tea throughout the day. 
 Also, take the apple from either the lunch or dinner meal and eat it for 
 breakfast. Low energy could also be caused by a hypoactive thyroid, 
 Candida yeast overgrowth, poor circulation, or parasites. If you did the 
 steps in Phase 1, low energy should not be a major concern. It is 
 extremely rare that low energy persists for more than a day or two during 
 Phase 2. It has never been reported that low energy ever reaches the point 
 of being de-habilitating. If you are experiencing low energy, know that 
 the condition is temporary, and will be addressed by following Phases 3 
 and 4. Back to top 


 Can I drink juices while doing the protocol? 

During Phase 2, since juices are not on the list, you cannot drink them. 
 However, in Phases 1, 3, and 4 you may drink juices. Ideally, you want to 
 drink made fresh at home with a juice machine such a JuiceMan, or Jack 
 LaLane Power Juicer. Use organic fruits and vegetables and drink the juice 
 within an hour after juicing. There are&quot;magic juices&quot;that I recommend 
 called goji, mangosteen, acai berry, noni, and aloe vera. Note that almost 
 all juice purchased that comes in a bottle, carton, can, or any container 
 should be 100% organic. Most of these juices have been pasteurized. This 
 means they have been heated to over 180 degrees for thirty minutes, 
 killing all the living enzymes and concentrating the sugar levels making 
 them highly refined or super highly refined. Many juices have sugar added 
 even though they claim on the label that there is no added sugar. Drinking 
 juices purchased from the supermarket, therefore, is not ideal. Back to top 
 

 What about human growth hormone, testosterone, or other hormone treatments? 

Receiving any hormone replacement therapy such as injections of human 
 growth hormone or testosterone can produce increased muscle mass, 
 increased energy, and fat reduction. There are many anti-aging benefits. 
 However, once you start taking hormones your body shuts down its normal 
 hormone production. This means you are actually making the condition worse 
 in the long run. You will be a slave to taking the hormone injections for 
 the rest of your life. This is serious business and you should strongly 
 consider all options before taking such drastic measures. There are, 
 however, homeopathic substances which stimulate the body to produce human 
 growth hormone naturally. One such product is called Renewal, available at www.alwaysyoung.com . Back to top 


 Can I take apple cider vinegar tablets instead of the liquid? 

Organic raw apple cider vinegar in liquid form is the best. However, it is 
 better to take apple cider vinegar tablets than taking nothing at all. I 
 personally take apple cider vinegar tablets on the occasions where it is 
 inconvenient to take the liquid form. Remember, organic raw apple cider 
 vinegar has almost miraculous health enhancing effects, as well as helping 
 reduce fat deposits in the body. Back to top 
 

 Must I eat breakfast as well as eating six times per day? 

Yes. Dr. Simeons stated that one of the causes of obesity was eating 
 infrequently and having extremely large meals. The human body&apos;s digestive 
 system is designed to eat smaller meals every few hours. The body is 
 designed to handle food that is raw or unrefined. The human body&apos;s 
 digestive tract is similar to primates; it best operates with continual 
 nibbling. It is not suited for gorging followed by long periods of time 
 without food. Thus, skipping breakfast, eating a light lunch, and a huge 
 dinner places a great unnatural burden on the digestive system and 
 intestinal tract. In today&apos;s society we eat large meals which contain more 
 food than the body requires at the moment in order to tide us over until 
 the next meal. This food has been produced to be easily digestible, is 
 highly refined, and floods the body with nourishment and calories for 
 which it has no immediate need and cannot physically handle The body must 
 store this surplus somehow somewhere, thus creating fat deposits. This is 
 why experts agree that eating breakfast, a snack mid-morning, lunch, a 
 snack mid-afternoon, dinner, and a snack in the evening, is one of the 
 healthiest, best long-term approaches for weight management and better 
 health. Back to top 
 

 Can I eat salt? 

During all the phases salt may be consumed, however, always choose sea 
 salt or Himalayan salt. Ideally, use salt in minimal amounts and use 
 approximately the same amount of salt each day. A sudden increase in salt 
 intake during Phase 2 will be followed by a corresponding temporary 
 increase in weight. It does not influence the loss of fat however. It will 
 only create retention of water, which will show up as increased weight on 
 the scale. Therefore, during Phase 2 keep your salt intake close to the 
 same every day. Back to top 
 

 The instructions in all the phases call for a large consumption of water and teas. Is this necessary? 

During all the phases you should drink a minimum of one-half gallon of 
 water per day, up to a maximum of one gallon. In addition to the water 
 intake you should be drinking several cups of the recommended teas. This 
 is, in fact, a large amount of liquid. It is important in the treatment of 
 the obesity condition. The importance and benefits of adhering to the 
 water and tea intake cannot be overemphasized. It is absolutely vital in 
 order for the protocol to work effectively. Back to top 


 Must I eliminate cosmetics, moisturizers, lotions, and creams during Phase 2? 

Yes. Dr. Simeons stated that most people find it hard to believe that the 
 fats, oils, creams, and ointments applied to the skin are absorbed into 
 the body and interfere with the weight reduction by hCG just as if those 
 ingredients were eaten. This almost incredible sensitivity to even such 
 very minor increases in nutritional and caloric intake is a peculiar 
 feature of the hCG method. Simeons found that persons who habitually 
 handle fats, such as workers in beauty parlors, masseuses, butchers, etc. 
 never show a satisfactory loss of weight when using hCG unless they avoid 
 all contact with the skin of such fats and various products. Simeons 
 illustrated this important point with two cases. A lady who was following 
 the protocol perfectly suddenly increased half a pound. No dietary error 
 was made and she used no face creams of any kind. Menses was not an issue 
 as she was already past menopause. This puzzled the doctors Finally, she 
 realized that she had bought herself a new set of makeup, pots, and 
 bottles. She used her fingers to transfer her large assortment of 
 cosmetics to the new containers. This was enough to create absorption 
 through the skin, which in turn adversely affected the hCG weight 
 reduction results. Another case concerned a man Simeons treated who was 
 twenty pounds overweight. From the first day of Phase 2 he did not lose 
 weight at a satisfactory level. He followed the program exactly, but still 
 without the anticipated one pound per day weight loss. In questioning, the 
 patient explained to Simeons that he had a glass eye. He changed and 
 cleaned the eye daily, putting a very special ointment into his eye 
 socket. The patient was told to stop using the ointment immediately. From 
 that day forward his weight loss became satisfactory and consistent.

Many modern cosmetics contain hormones which interfere with endocrine 
 regulations in the body and must be avoided. Remember, whatever you put on 
 the skin is absorbed into the body just as though you ate it. Back to top 
 

 What about abdominal exercises and aerobics? 

Aerobic exercise has many health benefits. In terms of resetting the body 
 weight set point, walking one hour per day outside is much more effective. 
 In terms of increasing metabolism and flushing the body of toxins, yoga 
 and rebounding is more effective. In terms of increasing muscle mass, 
 strength, and tone, as well as getting the body to release anti-aging 
 hormones, resistance training such as weight lifting is more effective. 
 Aerobic exercise is extremely healthy and beneficial and should be engaged 
 in by everyone at any level you desire.

Abdominal exercises or fancy abdominal exercise machines do, in fact, 
 strengthen and tone the abdominal muscles. They will not, however, burn 
 fat around the waist, midsection, or stomach. They will not eliminate the&quot;love handles.&quot;They will never flatten the stomach. I have been in the TV 
 infomercial and direct response industry for over twenty years. I know 
 most of the people selling these abdominal products. The joke in the 
 industry is that&quot;These products are for selling, not for using!&quot;The 
 advertisements for these products are all false and misleading. I should 
 know because I was involved in the production of many of them. If you want 
 to get a flat stomach and eliminate the fat around the waist and 
 midsection you must do&quot;the weight loss cure protocol&quot;in its entirety. If 
 you want stronger, more defined abdominal muscles, then abdominal 
 exercises are effective. But, you&apos;ll never see those defined abdominal 
 muscles unless you get rid of the layer of fat that is covering them! Back to top 
 

 What if I have problems sleeping? 

Getting seven to eight hours of deep sleep is important for health and 
 makes you lose weight. This research comes from Dr. Neal Kohatsu from the 
 California Department of Health Services. He states,&quot;Even a modest 
 increase in sleep duration has shown to have a clinically significant 
 affect on weight.&quot;Sleep disorders are caused by nutritional deficiencies, 
 MSG, and other excitotoxins, artificial sweeteners, the massive amounts of 
 caffeine and other stimulants consumed on a daily basis, trans fats, toxic 
 ingredients in the products you put on the skin, chlorine and fluoride in 
 the water you shower and bathe in, parasites, and several other factors. 
 If you do all the steps in Phase 1 and Phase 4, your ability to fall 
 asleep and sleep fully and deeply the entire night should be normalized 
 within ninety days. Studies show over 50% of Americans deal with some kind 
 of sleep problems at least two to three times per week. Another cause of 
 sleep disorders is non-prescription and prescription drug use. Most common 
 over-the-counter non-prescription and prescription drugs actually cause 
 sleep issues.

Non-prescription and prescription sleeping aids are one of the most 
 profitable market segments for drug companies. Like obesity, the food 
 companies and drug companies are specifically designing products and food 
 that cause sleep disorders. This is done purposely so that more sleeping 
 pills will be sold and corporate profits will continue to skyrocket. Isn&apos;t 
 it interesting that fifty years ago virtually no one had a hard time 
 falling asleep and staying asleep? Isn&apos;t it bizarre that today almost 
 everyone has a hard time falling asleep even though they are physically 
 exhausted? This condition has been created by the food companies and the 
 drug companies themselves! When you go through all four phases of this 
 protocol your sleep disorders will be corrected. Back to top 
 

 What about all these diet pills, patches, and products that claim to burn fat, reduce hunger, increase metabolism, block carbs, etc.? 

Repeat after me...scam, scam, scam, scam! They are rip offs and do not 
 work! Remember, I know most of the people who sell these worthless 
 products! For years I was involved in the production of the labels and 
 advertising of these products. Everything about these products is false, 
 misleading, and deceptive. They absolutely, categorically do not work. Do 
 not waste your money. In some cases they will temporarily, slightly reduce 
 hunger or increase metabolic rate. However, when you stop taking the 
 product your hunger comes back stronger than ever before, and your 
 metabolism is lower than before! You will gain all the weight back, plus 
 ten pounds! None of these products allow you to burn or release the secure 
 problem area fat reserves. When you use them, any weight you lose will be 
 either muscle or important structural fat. If a product is ever invented 
 that actually works I will personally endorse it and give all my 
 endorsement royalties to charity! Back to top 


 What about all these doctors and celebrities who endorse weight loss products or various food products? 

Celebrities, doctors, and everyone who endorses products does so for three 
 reasons. Money... money... and money. It&apos;s always all about the money. 
 These endorsers will say anything about the product as long as they get 
 the check. I should know because I hired celebrities and doctors to 
 endorse products I was involved with over the last twenty years. I can 
 tell you that if you heard what these people say about what they truly 
 think of these products it would make you sick. When you see them on 
 television looking so sincere, and telling you how wonderful their life is 
 because of this product, drug, or food, you must know that they are simply 
 reading a script. They are professional actors doing what they do 
 best...acting! If you saw the outtakes, and heard their comments after the 
 filming is completed, you would see that you are being mislead and lied 
 to. In most cases the celebrities and doctors endorsing products do not 
 even use the products they are endorsing. Remember, these doctors and 
 celebrities are paid millions of dollars to endorse, recommend, and help 
 companies sell their products. This is nothing more than deceptive and 
 fraudulent advertising at its highest. Back to top 


 After I do Phase 1, 2, and 3 should I continue weighing myself every day? 

Yes. Because you have dealt with the obesity condition for so long, it is 
 important to weigh yourself every day to make sure that you are 
 maintaining your new lower weight. This will help keep you focused on 
 doing the steps in Phase 4, thus making sure your bad habits do not return 
 and the weight stays off permanently. Back to top 
 

 Will this protocol restore structural fat that may have been lost during years of severe yo-yo dieting? 

Yes. Dr. Simeons discovered a curious condition that was common among 
 patients who have engaged in severe on and off dieting for years. These 
 patients had sagging skin and an unbearable pain in their heels which they 
 feel while standing or walking. When the heels of the feet were examined 
 the patients were found to have less than normal structural fat around the 
 bones. This created great pain while standing or walking. This showed that 
 the patients lost important structural fat during their past dieting 
 episodes. Even when these patients ate to capacity and gained weight, 
 these structural fat deposits did not return to normal. Even with rapid 
 and large weight gain, there was no improvement in the painful heels. In 
 all patients tested, Simeons found that within twenty days of the hCG 
 protocol, as outlined in Phase 2, the pain completely disappeared. In 
 follow-up over many years, no reoccurring pain ever was recorded. This 
 Simeons believed was further proof that the hCG, plus specific diet 
 protocol, not only removes abnormal secure problem area fat deposits, but 
 actually permits the body to replace important structural fat in needed 
 areas. This occurs in spite of the low caloric intake of food. Back to top 


 Will I gain the weight back? 

If you go back to eating fast food, restaurant food, and food containing 
 trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, super highly refined food, 
 artificial sweeteners, meat, poultry and dairy with growth hormone and 
 antibiotics, etc., etc., etc., you will, in fact, mess up your 
 hypothalamus again and regain the weight. If, however, you follow the dos 
 and don&apos;ts in Phase 4, the weight should never return. It is interesting 
 to note that Simeons&apos;s patients of the 1950s and 1960s very rarely, if 
 ever, gained the weight back. This is because fast food, trans fats, high 
 fructose corn syrup, etc. was not in widespread use. Today, however, 
 because the food industry is on a mission to create an obese world, it is 
 more difficult to avoid all of the new things that cause obesity. Follow 
 the steps in Phase 4 and you should be able to keep the weight off 
 forever. Back to top 
 

 If the weight comes back can I do this protocol again? 

Yes. If you lose a substantial amount of weight and a year later find you 
 have gained some weight back, do the protocol as often as you desire. I 
 know of many people that have lost sixty pounds or more who find 
 themselves gaining ten to fifteen pounds over a year&apos;s time. Rather than 
 let their weight gain get out of hand, they do Phase 2 of the protocol for 
 three weeks each year to lose the weight because they have found it is the 
 easiest and most effective way to lose abnormal fat and has the best 
 long-term effects. Back to top 
 

 What if the food label says &quot;all natural&quot;? 

Today, the phrase&quot;all natural&quot;means absolutely nothing! Major food 
 manufacturers have lobbied congress allowing new laws to be passed 
 defining what can legally be called&quot;all natural.&quot;Even if the food 
 contains thousands of chemicals and is heavily processed, it is still 
 legal to use the phrase&quot;all natural.&quot;This is deceptive. If the food is 
 labeled&quot;all natural&quot;the company is trying to deceive you. You must read 
 the ingredient list on the food. Look for 100% organic. Back to top 


 Should I buy food that says &quot;diet&quot;, &quot;lite&quot;, &quot;low fat&quot;, &quot;low carb&quot;, &quot;fat free&quot;, etc.? 

No. These are marketing ploys and scams designed to deceive you. Always 
 read the ingredient list on the product labels. Always look for 100% 
 organic. Back to top 
 

 What if I&apos;m skeptical and nervous about using this protocol? 

Dr. Simeons found that patients were often skeptical about the claims that 
 this protocol could be done without hunger and would deliver fast and 
 long-term results. He overcame this by letting new patients spend some 
 time in the waiting room with patients who were currently engaged in the 
 protocol. The existing patients would always explain to the potential new 
 patients, with evangelical zeal, the ease and spectacular results they 
 were achieving. When new potential patients heard firsthand and saw with 
 their own eyes the results, skepticism, apprehension, and anxiety was 
 always relieved. I would encourage you to visit www.hcgobesity.org and view before and after photos of actual patients who have engaged in 
 this protocol. Also go to www.naturalcures.com and look under the weight loss section. Read Dr. Simeons&apos;s manuscript 
 Pounds and Inches: A New Approach to Obesity for yourself Read actual 
 patient testimonials from real people who have done this protocol. Do not 
 listen to doctors or the news media that have a direct financial interest 
 in keeping the truth about this protocol hidden. Do not listen to any 
 government official, medical doctor, journalist, reporter, or individual 
 who has not personally done the exact original Simeons&quot;weight loss cure 
 protocol&quot;exactly as outlined. If they haven&apos;t actually done it themselves 
 they cannot possibly give a legitimate opinion? Back to top 
 

 Do I really need to eat organic grass fed beef, organic poultry, and organic milk, cheese, and dairy products? 

Yes. Unless it is 100% organic, the animals and dairy products will be 
 loaded with growth hormones, antibiotics, and other animal drugs When you 
 consume meat, poultry, and dairy you are, in fact, consuming these animal 
 growth hormones and drugs. This causes health problems in the body, 
 depression, and leads to obesity. If the animals are not 100% organic and 
 grass fed, they are fed genetically modified grain, man-made chemical food 
 products, and ground up dead animals. This creates meat, poultry and dairy 
 products that are unnatural and will, in fact, lead to obesity and other 
 diseases. Back to top 
 

 Why are fast food, and regional and chain restaurants so bad? 

All restaurant food is designed to make you fat: The worst offenders are 
 fast food chains, All regional and national chain restaurants should also 
 be avoided. Virtually all restaurants have their food produced by the same 
 small group of multinational food companies. Almost all restaurant food 
 comes premade, premixed, preseasoned, freeze dried, frozen, or in jars and 
 cans. Restaurants today do not cook food from scratch. They are not using 
 fresh organic ingredients. Most food served in these kinds of restaurant 
 are simply reheated! The food sold in fast food restaurants, regional and 
 national restaurants, and most other restaurants are loaded to the highest 
 degree with the specific ingredients that cause obesity. These include 
 super highly refined sugars, such as high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, 
 sucrose, and dextrose; trans fats, such as hydrogenated or partially 
 hydrogenated oils; artificial sweeteners, including aspartame and sucrolos; 
 meat, poultry, and dairy loaded with growth hormone, antibiotics, and 
 other animal drugs; virtually no food with any fiber; food that is super 
 highly refined and extremely high on the glycemic index; monosodium 
 glutamate and other exeitotoxins; and meals that are massively high in 
 calories. This situation permeates American culture and is spreading all 
 around the world. Wherever these kinds of restaurants spring up, and this 
 kind of food is sold, obesity springs up as well. We know that smoking 
 cigarettes causes cancer. The tobacco companies lied about this known fact 
 for fifty years. We now know that eating food from fast food restaurants, 
 regional and national chain restaurants, and most other restaurants, 
 absolutely causes obesity. These companies have done this purposely and 
 are lying to us now about this true fact. Back to top 


 Will you be setting up clinics around the world offering this protocol? 

I am assisting medical doctors around the world in setting up clinics 
 where this protocol can be taught and administered. For a list of doctors 
 who administer this protocol, and clinics that offer this protocol, go to www.naturalcures.com . 
 Look under the weight loss section. Back to top 
 

 Do you have any recipes that work with the protocol? 

Yes. I intend on coming out with a cookbook in the future. I am not a 
 chef. I do, however, cook simple, delicious meals almost every day. 
 Fantastic meals can be made from scratch in less than an hour and, in most 
 cases, in less than thirty minutes. If I can cook, anybody can cook! I 
 should have a show on the Food Network! Call or e-mail them and let them 
 know you think so as well. For current recipes and DVDs with cooking 
 instructions go to www.naturalcures.com . Back to top 


 What if I show no weight loss four days in a row while on Phase 2? 

Dr. Simeons discussed at length daily weight fluctuations or reaching 
 weight plateaus. He explained that at times there may be no drop of weight 
 at all for two or three days, which is then followed by a sudden large 
 drop which reestablishes the normal daily average of about one pound per 
 day during Phase 2. Weight fluctuations occur more so in women than in 
 men. If a person weighs themselves and notices that the weight stays the 
 same for four days in a row, the patient is told that after weighing on 
 the fourth morning, to only eat six organic apples for that day. The 
 patient is told to drink nothing except a small amount of water, just 
 enough to quench their thirst when needed. Two cups of corn silk tea 
 should be consumed. The next morning there should be a drop in weight. If 
 not, do not be concerned. It is important to note that because this 
 protocol is synthesizing and releasing so much abnormal fat, the body may 
 retain excess water in order to rid the system of this excess released fat 
 and accompanying toxins. This at times results in no apparent weight loss 
 on the scale, however, you must know that the body is still being 
 reshaped, and massive fat loss is still occurring. Back to top 


 Can I do Phase 1 for longer than thirty days? 

Yes. You can do the items in Phase 1 for as short or as long as you want. 
 Doing if for a minimum of thirty days immediately before starting Phase 2 
 is ideal. Some people have done the steps in Phase 1 for forty-five, 
 sixty, even ninety days before starting Phase 2. This was mainly due to 
 the fact that Phase 1 has no restrictions on the amount of food you can 
 consume. Patients found doing Phase 1 was easy and they saw consistent 
 weight loss; therefore, because they were apprehensive about doing Phase 
 2, they simply continued with doing the steps in Phase 1 This is entirely 
 acceptable. In actual fact, if you were to do all the steps in Phase 1 
 with strict adherence for ninety to 120 days in a row you would actually 
 begin to reset the body&apos;s weight set point and correct the abnormal 
 hypothalamus condition. Weight loss would be slow, but you would in fact 
 be releasing abnormal secure fat deposits. This is another alternative for 
 those who do not want or are unable to do the hCG protocol. If you do 
 Phase 1 for an extended period of time you should do the LifeForce Plan 
 Candida cleanse ( www.lifeforceplan.com ), 
 as well as a liver cleanse and a parasite cleanse, to achieve the full 
 results of resetting the hypothalamus. Back to top 


 Can I take higher doses of HCG? 

Simeons said never go above 200 International Units of hCG a day. He also 
 said do not take a larger amount and increasing the duration between 
 injections. Therefore, do not take a weekly injection, for example. You 
 must take only between 125-200 Ms, and this must be taken every day during 
 the protocol. Back to top 


 Can I stay on Phase 2 longer than six weeks? 

Simeons found that the body has a tendency to create an immunity to hCG. 
 Therefore, staying on Phase 2 for longer than six weeks is not advised. 
 You must take at least a six-week break before you start the injections 
 and protocol of Phase 2 again This is important, as once your body starts 
 developing immunity to hCG you will no longer be burning abnormal fat 
 reserves, but rather start burning structural fat and muscle. Therefore, 
 if you complete six weeks of Phase 2, and still desire to lose more 
 weight, you must then do Phase 3 for six weeks. Then, do Phase 2 again up 
 to a maximum of six weeks. If you still have more weight you wish to lose, 
 then do Phase 3 for eight weeks. Then, do Phase 2 again for up to a 
 maximum of six weeks. If you still have more weight you wish to lose, do 
 Phase 3 for ten weeks. Then, do Phase 2 again for a maximum of six weeks. 
 Continue adding two weeks to Phase 3 for as long as you need. When you 
 have reached your desired weight during Phase 2, continue by doing Phase 3 
 for three weeks, then continue to Phase 4. Back to top 


 What if I&apos;m vegetarian? 

If you are a vegetarian and cannot do the diet in Phase 2, then it is 
 advised that you not do the Phase 2 Simeons protocol of diet and hCG. 
 Instead, do the Turbo Protein Diet as your Phase 2. Available at www.almased.com . Back to top 


 What if I&apos;m really stressed? 

Stress plays havoc with your hormones and will lead to obesity and other 
 health problems. Good methods of stress reduction include laughing, giving 
 and receiving hugs, playing with pets or children, singing, dancing, 
 drinking small amounts of alcohol, playing a musical instrument, massage 
 and other types of body works, reflexology, acupuncture, listening to 
 stress reducing CDs, walking outside, coral calcium, B-complex, and 
 AlphaCalm The more you reduce stress the easier weight loss will be. Back to top 
 

 Is buying food in bulk a good idea? 

No. Research shows that buying in bulk causes people to eat more 
 frequently, and larger quantities of food. Ideally, keep little food in 
 your home. Buy food on a daily basis for daily consumption. This allows 
 you to buy fresher, more nutritious food, as well as reducing the quantity 
 and frequency of food you consume. Back to top 
 

 What about homogenized dairy products? 

The best dairy products are 100% organic and raw. Raw means the dairy 
 products have not been pasteurized or homogenized. Pasteurization and 
 homogenization of dairy products changes their chemical compositions, 
 making them hard to digest and creating excess mucus in the body. If you 
 can only get homogenized and pasteurized dairy products, limit their use. Back to top 


 Why are the majority of children today fat starting at birth? 

There are many factors causing the majority of children to be classified 
 as overweight, fat, and obese. During pregnancy the mother is releasing 
 secured fat reserves which nourish the child. Because of all the toxins 
 consumed by the mother before conception, these fat reserves are loaded 
 with toxicity, which is transferred to the unborn fetus. What the mother 
 eats transfers to the unborn fetus as well. This means the unborn fetus is 
 being flooded with residues of non-prescription and prescription drugs, 
 herbicides, pesticides, trans fats, artificial sweeteners, and thousands 
 of other chemical compounds. When the child is born, the likelihood that 
 the hypothalamus has already been overtaxed is very high. Not breast 
 feeding and using formula that has been microwaved worsens the condition. 
 Early and massive use of vaccines and antibiotics also cause the 
 hypothalamus to become abnormal, thus creating obese children. School 
 lunch programs and&quot;kids meals&quot;are loaded with the highest amounts of 
 super highly refined food and sugars, lack of fiber, high fructose corn 
 syrup, trans fats, nitrites, and MSG. The kids don&apos;t have a chance. 
 Obesity will continue to rise as this is what the food industry wants. Back to top 
 

 Any suggestions for eating in restaurants? 

Eating in restaurants is a nightmare. The food is heavily processed, 
 loaded with trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, MSG, and lacks fiber. It 
 is almost never fresh. The portions are outrageously huge The environment 
 in restaurants creates massive overeating, and eating food that is 
 specifically designed to make us fat. On one occasion I was in a 
 restaurant eating breakfast. It noticed on the menu a&quot;fresh fruit salad.&quot;I asked the waitress if the fruit salad was fresh. She said yes. When it 
 arrived it was obvious that it was canned, loaded with heavy sugary syrup. 
 I told the waitress that the fruit salad appeared to be canned. She said 
 yes. I was surprised. I asked her,&quot;Didn&apos;t you say it was fresh?&quot;She 
 replied,&quot;It is fresh; we opened the can this morning.&quot;On another 
 occasion I asked if the chicken wings on the menu came premade and frozen. 
 The waitress said yes, but they were&quot;all-natural.&quot;I asked if I could see 
 the bag so I could read the ingredient list. There were over seventy-five 
 ingredients in these chicken wings, including monosodium glutamate, high 
 fructose corn syrup, and trans fats. It&apos;s hard to eat restaurant food. 
 This is why you must consistently do the various cleanses throughout the 
 year to get poisonous toxins out of your system. An effective technique 
 that I use when eating in restaurants is this: knowing that the portions 
 will be enormous, I normally tell the waitress to take half of my food and 
 put it in a&quot;to go bag,&quot;and only serve me a half-size portion. This is 
 always more than enough food and makes it so I don&apos;t have to use willpower 
 to stop eating. I also order one main course and share it with my dinner 
 companion. Back to top 
 

 What if I have only ten pounds to lose? 

If you do all the steps in Phase 1 you may lose all the weight you need 
 to. However, the Simeons&quot; weight 
 loss cure protocol &quot;is designed to reshape and re-sculpt the body and 
 release abnormal fat deposits. If you are on Phase 2 and lose all the 
 weight you need before the minimum three weeks has been completed, simply 
 double the amount of food on the diet. Back to top 
 

 When the FDA, AMA, or FTC says a medical treatment or drug is effective and safe, or ineffective and dangerous, aren&apos;t they usually correct in their statements? 

No. These organizations have repeatedly said that thousands of drugs are 
 safe and effective. Later, these drugs, like Vioxx, need to be pulled off 
 the market because so many people are dying or developing major medical 
 conditions. The FDA&apos;s history of emphatically claiming a drug is safe, 
 then pulling it off the market because it becomes proven to be unsafe, is 
 full of thousands of such cases. Whistle- blowers who work for the FDA 
 claim that the FDA&apos;s statements of safety and effectiveness of surgical 
 procedures can never be trusted. Conversely, when the FDA says that 
 something is not effective and unsafe, they are often proven in court to 
 be lying or making such statements without any substantiation or 
 documentation. There are hundreds of examples where courts have proven 
 that the FDA and various medical boards make statements claiming that 
 certain natural products and procedures are dangerous when there is 
 absolutely no substantiation. Statements made by the AMA, FDA, FTC, and 
 various medical boards can never be trusted. This comes directly from 
 whistle-blowers who are working, or who have worked, directly for these 
 agencies. Back to top 
 

 Do medical boards, the AMA, FDA, or other organizations really suppress effective cures that could help people? 

Yes. This has been proven in hundreds of documented cases all around the 
 world. The most recent example is two Australian medical doctors who 
 claimed to have discovered that bacteria lives in the stomach which can 
 partially be responsible for ulcers. For over 100 years, the established 
 medical community has known the fact that bacteria does not, and can not, 
 live in the stomach. These medical doctors were ridiculed, harassed, 
 discredited, and almost lost their licenses. After ten years of 
 persecution,&quot;science&quot;finally proved that these two doctors were correct 
 with their discovery. The entire medical establishment was wrong for over 
 100 years. The doctors received a Nobel Prize for their discovery. 
 Suppression of effective, safe cures is widespread around the world. Back to top 


 Weren&apos;t you sued by the Federal Trade Commission and called a habitual false advertiser? 

The U.S. Government has said in their own internal documents that agencies 
 are encouraged to sue, debunk, discredit, and make false allegations 
 against anyone and any company that it deems has taken any action that 
 could expose internal corruption, conflicts of interest, or adversely 
 affect profits of the corporations who are in effect paying the 
 politicians. The FTC has sued and made false accusations against hundreds 
 of individuals and companies that expose the truth about inexpensive, safe 
 and effective, natural cures for medical conditions. I was sued twice by 
 the FTC for allegedly making false, misleading, and unsubstantiated 
 statements in advertising. This is the standard method that the FTC uses 
 to crush whistle-blowers. All of these allegations have been proven in 
 court to be totally false The FTC was forced to drop all charges against 
 me and sign official court documents stating that after a full 
 investigation,&quot;There is no finding of any wrongdoing by Mr. Trudeau or 
 any of his companies.&quot;I have never paid any fines to the FTC. The attacks 
 on me started when I became a whistle- blower exposing the corruption and 
 conflicts of interest in the FTC, FDA, and other state and federal 
 agencies. It is interesting to note that the FTC has never sued a 
 pharmaceutical or food corporation, even though it has been proven in 
 court that they routinely engage in false and misleading advertising and 
 make unsubstantiated claims. U.S. government agencies routinely lie, 
 deceive, and mislead the public in an attempt to protect the profits of 
 large conglomerates. The most obvious example of this is when the United 
 States Supreme Court ruled that the tomato, which is scientifically a 
 fruit, be legally called a vegetable so that additional tax revenue can be 
 generated by the government! I am currently suing the Federal Trade 
 Commission and other government agencies for their blatant and flagrant 
 violations of the U.S. Constitution against me and other citizens. 
 Remember, insiders at these agencies have said themselves that these 
 bureaucracies do not protect citizens, but rather do everything in their 
 power to protect conglomerate profits. Back to top 


 Should I read your first two books? 

Yes. Natural Cures&quot;They&quot;Don&apos;t Want You To Know About has sold over six 
 million copies. It exposes in great length the unholy alliance between the 
 drug companies, food companies, media, and government agencies. It gives 
 you the inexpensive, safe and effective, all-natural, non-drug and 
 nonsurgical ways to cure and prevent virtually every disease. There are 
 inexpensive, natural alternatives to virtually every drug on the market. 
 This expos blows the whistle and exposes information that&quot;they&quot;don&apos;t 
 want you to know about.

More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That 
 Cure Disease picks up where the first book left off and contains 
 information that was actually censored out of the first book by the U.S. 
 Government. Both books give information that is not available anywhere 
 else. They are fast, entertaining, and exciting reads. Back to top 
 

 Do thoughts play a role in obesity? 

Yes. Remember, you become what you think about. The pictures you have in 
 your mind, what you think about, and what you say with your mouth all have 
 powerful effects on the physiology and can contribute greatly in creating 
 obesity or creating a thin, lean, healthy body. Two effective techniques 
 that can help you use these facts to your advantage are as follows. Write 
 down the phrase&quot;I weigh pounds.&quot;Put your goal weight in the blank. Put 
 this card everywhere you can see it, such as on your computer screen, on 
 your TV, on the dashboard of your car, on the mirror in your bathroom, on 
 your refrigerator, etc. Carry it with you at all times. Look at this card 
 as many times as possible throughout the day and say the words out loud. 
 This will help program your mind to create your ideal weight. Another 
 effective technique is to use a computer software program to put your face 
 on a picture of the body that you desire. Put this picture, or pictures, 
 everywhere you can see it throughout the day. Look at this picture as many 
 times as possible. This will help create the picture in your mind that 
 will cause it to be attracted into your life. Thoughts are, in fact, things! Back to top 
 

 Is the media really biased? 

The media is very biased and has major conflicts of interest, which means 
 it can never have objective journalism. All major television networks are 
 owned by multinational corporations that in turn own thousands of 
 companies around the world. The large corporations, therefore, use the 
 television networks to promote their other business holdings. A perfect 
 example is Fox News Network. Fox News is owned by News Corp., which is 
 owned by Rupert Murdock. News Corp owns Harper Collins book publishers. 
 All of the Fox News TV anchors get books published by Harper Collins They 
 are told to use their television shows to promote their books. Fox also 
 uses its TV network to promote other books sold by Harper Collins It also 
 uses its network to bash and discredit books published by other publishing 
 companies, such as mine. This happens with every television network. TV 
 news shows are nothing more than commercials promoting products sold by 
 the group&apos;s other companies, and discrediting products sold by 
 competitors. Because I expose the drug companies and the fast food 
 industry, most news shows will never have me on as a guest. Because I 
 expose what the news channels are doing and how they deceive the public, I 
 am constantly bashed and discredited by news organizations. Another 
 example is the Larry King Show on CNN. I was scheduled to appear on Larry 
 King because I had the biggest selling nonfiction book in America. Every 
 major author has been invited as a guest on Larry King. When the 
 executives at CNN heard that I was going to be a guest, they immediately 
 ordered Larry King to cancel my appearance. They gave no rational 
 explanation. My insiders at CNN tell me that the executives are petrified 
 that I will expose the CNN news network, its drug company sponsors, and 
 food company sponsors. Because the Larry King Show is live, I could not be 
 edited. The major advertisers and senior executives do not want me to 
 educate the public about their unhealthy products. As you can see, there 
 is no objective journalism. Back to top 
 

 Do electromagnetic frequencies really affect our cells and cause weight gain? 

Yes. All wireless devices, and all electrical wiring, create 
 electromagnetic fields which adversely affect the cells in the body, 
 creating hormonal imbalances leading to fatigue, depression, and weight 
 gain. If you&apos;ve ever been in your home when the electricity went out you 
 would notice how amazingly quiet everything becomes. You will notice that 
 you begin to feel calmer and more relaxed almost instantly. This occurs 
 when people go camping and sleep in a tent or log cabin without 
 electricity. Without all the electromagnetic fields, the body dramatically 
 relaxes and normalizes. This is why you need some kind of device that can 
 neutralize EMFs. Back to top 
 

 Do governments and corporations really work together to make us fat? 

Yes. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is pure economics. Governments 
 are pressured by corporations to write laws and do things that protect and 
 increase corporate profits, even at the expense of citizens. Governments 
 around the world have passed laws making corporations legal entities with 
 all the same rights and privileges as human beings! In America, in 
 airports and interstate highways, governments passed laws allowing only 
 fast food restaurants like McDonald&apos;s and Burger King to be the exclusive 
 food providers for travelers. Virtually nothing is homemade. This unholy 
 alliance between governments and corporations is not new. Big Tobacco has 
 paid off politicians, allowing cigarettes and other tobacco products to be 
 the only item in America where the ingredients do not have to be listed! 
 This was done because the tobacco companies did not want to show the 
 hundreds of poisonous chemicals put in cigarettes. Ingredients do not have 
 to be listed on food sold in restaurants for the same reason. Some of you 
 may have watched the movie The Aviator. I recommend the movie. It shows 
 how Pan American Airlines was paying off politicians to get laws passed 
 giving Pan Am a monopoly for transatlantic travel. The bill that was 
 promoted by the senator from Maine was actually written by the executives 
 of Pan American Airlines! This goes on all the time. A company called 
 Halliburton received massive construction contracts from the government 
 without any other company allowed to bid. It is estimated that Halliburton 
 has overcharged the government in excess of $100 billion in Just the last 
 few years! Corruption between corporations and governments continues to 
 rise. One tragic example is when corporations and the super wealthy of the 
 world paid off U.S. politicians to write laws allowing stocks to be bought 
 and sold without exposing the owners. This was because the corporations 
 and super wealthy wanted to be able to buy and sell stocks on inside 
 information without their identities being revealed. The day before the 
 9/11 tragedy these secret individuals or entities bought massive amounts 
 of airline stocks hoping their value would go down. When 9/11 happened, 
 the airline stocks crashed, and these anonymous individuals and 
 corporations made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. They 
 obviously knew that the World Trade Center would be attacked by airplanes 
 in this terrorist activity. The government could have easily required that 
 the identities of those who profited be revealed. The government will not 
 do so because it is more concerned about protecting the profits of these 
 corporations and individuals than in protecting American citizens. Back to top 
 

 Can you define &quot;homemade&quot; or &quot;made from scratch&quot;? 

Making things from scratch means you start with single basic ingredients. 
 Some people are confused about what making something from scratch means. 
 As an example, I had a friend who said she was going to make a pie from 
 scratch. She went out and bought a premade pie crust, bought canned pie 
 filling, and bought Cool Whip topping. This is not making something from 
 scratch. Making a pie from scratch means using flour, water, eggs, salt, 
 and butter to make your crust. It means getting fresh fruit, organic raw 
 sugar, cinnamon sticks, and fresh lemon juice squeezed from a real lemon 
 to make your filling. It means getting fresh organic raw cream and 
 whipping it into whipped cream for your topping. This is making something 
 from scratch. Cookbooks today teach people how to open up cans of soup, 
 use premixed products, and making them believe they are cooking from 
 scratch. These cookbooks are a joke. Because it&apos;s so hard to get good food 
 in real life, I suggest doing what I do. I almost always make my own 
 lunch, put it in a lunch bucket, and take it with me. It&apos;s easy, it&apos;s 
 cheaper, and makes you feel fantastic knowing you&apos;re eating food with the 
 best quality organic ingredients, made from scratch! Back to top 


 Do food companies really lie to us about their products just to make money? 

Yes. McDonald&apos;s said they were taking trans fats out of their food; they 
 have not. They lied to us for years about the fact that they were using 
 beef fat to make their French fries. They lie to us now about the fact 
 that they put sugar on their French fries. One food manufacturer had a 
 pudding it called&quot;lite.&quot;The label proudly said&quot;One-third the calories 
 of our regular pudding!&quot;They were deceiving everyone, because what they 
 didn&apos;t tell you was it was the exact same pudding, but the containers were 
 one-third the size! Arby&apos;s makes a sandwich with something it calls roast 
 beef. It is not roast beef at all. They actually had to payoff politicians 
 to rewrite the laws which allowed them to call their artificial man-made 
 product&quot;roast beef.&quot;Companies deceive us with labels that say such 
 things as&quot;Made with real juice.&quot;We are led to believe that the product 
 is real juice. It is not. The product is made WITH real juice. This means 
 they can put in a drop of juice and the rest can be chemicals! The 
 examples go on and on. Companies like Arthur Daniels Midland Company makes 
 billions of dollars selling genetically modified, manufactured food 
 products around the world. One of the largest privately held corporations 
 is the international food giant Cargill, which is trying to monopolize how 
 food is manufactured, sold, and distributed around the world. Their goal 
 is to make local farms, fresh fruits and vegetables, and fresh meat and 
 poultry a thing of the past! They want everything mass-produced, 
 preseasoned, prepackaged, and made in such a way that these food products 
 can be stored for years and years. In restaurants and in the food we buy, 
 the ingredients listed are bad enough, but imagine all of the things that 
 are not listed, such as over 15,000 chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, 
 chlorine, and fluoride. These do not have to be listed on the label. The 
 food can be genetically modified, pasteurized, microwaved, irradiated, 
 gassed, or filled with other poisons, none of which have to be listed on 
 the label. All of these things lead to obesity. Back to top 
 

 Do drugs really make us fat? 

Yes. All nonprescription over-the-counter and prescription drugs cause 
 disease and obesity. As an example, all decongestants, even those found in 
 cough syrups, create high blood pressure. High blood pressure itself leads 
 to obesity. High blood pressure medication creates dehydration and dry 
 mouth syndrome. This also leads to obesity. All drugs have a cumulative 
 effect by continually leaving trace toxic residue in fatty tissues in the 
 body. This leads to obesity and other health conditions. This is why 
 cleaning these toxins out of the fatty tissue by doing The Purification 
 Program is so vitally important. Back to top 


 You&apos;re not a doctor. How can I feel good about your dos and don&apos;ts in Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4? 

Every single do and don&apos;t in all four phases of this protocol come 
 directly from medical doctors and credentialed experts. Thousands of 
 licensed health care practitioners around the world use these dos and 
 don&apos;ts with spectacular results. No negative side effects are experienced. 
 These are not my recommendations. I did not create or invent them. I am 
 simply reporting on what doctors around the world are using successfully. 
 All the backup references are in the Appendix of this book, and in the

 Disclaimer: We at HCGFatLoss.com do not claim that HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin) 
 can alter fat or weight loss alone, but according to doctors in other 
 countries using HCG with a particular protocol will result in loss of fat 
 and weight by stimulating the hypothalamus gland. The clinical research 
 trials published by the Journal of the American Medical Association and 
 the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that HCG is 
 ineffective as a weight-loss aid, but their findings never actually tested 
 the entire HCG protocol rather just bits and pieces of it. The tests they 
 did were not conducted in the same manner as Dr Simeons originally 
 specified in the HCG diet or in the HCG protocol. In some cases they did 
 not even give a HCG injection to the test subjects. However due to the 
 outrage of certain organizations in 1976 HCG was deemed as a drug that did 
 not promote weight loss. Many HCG clinics had to close their doors due to 
 the poor test results back in 1976, and people could no longer buy HCG in 
 the US. The HCG levels administered for some test subjects were not 
 listed, nor was their diet or beginning HCG levels to determine if they 
 were low HCG levels or not, their starting weight or their finishing 
 weight. We were just told by their results that people lose the same 
 amount with or with out HCG injections. In detailed studies where the HCG 
 hormone was used then with the entire HCG protocol proved the 
 effectiveness of HCG for weight loss in other countries. This is why so 
 many people today still want to buy HCG. It has never been proven as 
 harmful as cigarettes, while those are still sold there is still a lack of 
 HCG to buy. Since that time markets overseas continued to sell HCG shots, 
 HCG powder, HCG tablets, HCG supplies, HCG supplements, and HCG mail 
 order, while those of us in the US have had to sit and wait while 
 politicians have never passed a law against HCG. HCG blogs have emerged 
 since Kevin Trudeau has reintroduced the US to HCG. There have never been 
 any proven side effects of HCG while using it for weight loss. HCG is 
 still administered in clinics for fertility drugs, so if it is safe for 
 fertility drugs, then HCG must be safe enough for weight loss treatments 
 as well.
