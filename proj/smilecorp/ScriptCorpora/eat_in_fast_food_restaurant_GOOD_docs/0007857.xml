 Questions and Answers 
 
 
 No power to selinoid 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  The unit seems to start up and you can hear the water starting to heat befor the low pressure light comes on. I have checked the selinoid and this seems to check out ok but there seems to be no power going to it any suggestions Submitted 71 days ago  | by
 Mike, Cheshire A:   
  You can check it if you have a multi meter,you should have a reading of at least k3.5 ohms, across the twoterminals any less and you need a new valve. (Check the valve in thefailed state.) (When it has stopped working!) 
 
 If there is power getting to the solenoid and it is not operating then there is a good chance that you have a faulty solenoid.

 The video is intended as a guide and does not cover every shower. 

 If you don’t have a multimeter we sell them with a guide on how to use them for checking and testing the various parts of your shower. 

 Apartfrom helping to fix your shower, they are really useful for checkingyou have a power supply to appliances, for checking fuses and lettingyou know much power you have left in batteries 

 (So you will know if they are good or not) and lots of other jobs, in short they are well worth a few pounds

 T300si Low pressure light. 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  Have had repeated problems with the low pressure warning light coming on and the shower running cold only.

Have been able to remedy the problem for a short while by cleaning the relay contacts on the pcb, but the intervals are getting shorter.

Would replacing the pcb altogether remedy the problem? Submitted 71 days ago  | by
 Mike999, Nottingham A:   

 
 

 The things to check first are. 

 1 That the main valve coming into your house is fully open. 

 2 Then check that the valve on the line to the shower is fully open. 

 If these valves are not fully open then there may not be enough water getting to your shower to open/close the safety device that allows the power through to the elements.

 Spark about half way up PCB on switch off 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  I have just replaced the stabiliser valve - I thought all went well and it has cured the leak - thanks for the advice. However, when testing I noticed on switch off that there is a spark about half way up the PCB (near 5 and 6 on the diagram). Maybe a daft question, but is this normal behaviour? It looks like there are various contacts that could spark on separation. Submitted 110 days ago  | by

 Q:  Hi 1st shower went really hot couldnt use high setting at all but then went lukewarm even on high max.checked all valves ,replaced flow valve and TCO is it the elements? Submitted 146 days ago  | by
 Anonymous, norwich A:   
 If thereis any heat at all then the TCO is not faulty 
 
   
 
 It maybe a faulty element in the heating tank (there are two, three in most 10kwshowers) you can check them with a multi meter you should have a reading ofaround 12&gt;18 ohms. 
 
 If you have power to the elementsand no heat it&apos;s probably the elements, no power to the elements thenit&apos;s probably a micro switch.

 Leak 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  All of a sudden my T300i has sprung a leak, seems that it leaks when shower is running, but stops as soon as you turn shower off. Took cover off, and when shower runs is leaks from around parts 10, 11 and 13 area. Cant see properly where its leaking from as its live and when its turned off does not leak. Its not a small leak, but big enough to soak tea towels in a 20 seconds. Hope im making sense. Submitted 153 days ago  | by
 flapper, Cowes A:   
 It is most likely that the top of the stabiliser valve thatis leaking.

 If these valves are not fully open then there may not be enough water

 the power off until it cools Then it all starts again 

 

 Make sure that the shower head is clean and clear, that the hose isn’t kinked (this can happen just behind the hand set where it is difficult to see) also check the inside of the hose although it can look OK on the outside it could have collapsed internally 

 The other possibility is a faulty flow/stabilizer valve not allowing the correct amount of water into the shower. 

 A ruff check is to remove the shower head turn temperature control to fully hot the water coming out of the hose should be a bit more than a dribble then turn to fully cold and it should be coming out at full flow. 

 If there is not much difference between the two then you could have a faulty flow valve. 

 Carry out this check after you check the inlet valves.

 Carry out this check after you check the inlet valves. 

 Also if it is a Triton have a look at the outlet TCO 

 The outlet Thermal Cut Out this is a black disk with two wires going to it and it is mounted on the out let pipe (The bit between the heating tank and the hose) 
 Examine the connections closely if you see any discoloration / signs of overheating then the TCO needs replaced. 

 

 The other possibility is a faulty element in the heating tank (there are two, three in most 10kw showers) you can check them with a multi meter you should have a reading of around 12&gt;18 ohms.

 water leaking 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  We have water pouring out of the remote box in the airing cupboard? This has all the electrics in it. Submitted 283 days ago  | by
 snozzer, Nottingham A:  
   I think the pressure relief device has blown. 

   

 It’s a safety device on the bottom of the heating tank or outlet pipe 

   

 It is fairly easy to replace however there is usually something that causes it to blow, 

 often a kink in the hose or the showerhead is blocked, so check this before fitting the new PRD.

Recently the Stop/Start button on my shower has been misfuncitoning and i have to press it repeatedly or hold it in to get the shower to stop/ start. Can this be remedied by replacing the PCB p/n 7072569?



Mark Dyas Submitted 340 days ago  | by
 Mark Dyas, Wirral CH63 9LZ A:  
 This is a difficult one without being able to see the shower. 

   

 The easy answer is to say yes that board should fix the problem, however you could have the same symptoms if you had a faulty relay on the power pack PCB or a solenoid valve that is starting to go faulty. 

 If once it starts running it will run on its own for say 10 mins then it is unlikely to be the solenoid. 

 I think you probably need someone pressing the on/off button and someone watching the power pack to work out when the button is pressed, is the relay on the board making and staying engaged or is the relay on the power pack board failing and dropping out. 

 The answer is probably a little confusing however without seeing this it is the best I can do.

 T300si Start/Stop problem 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  In the past week I’ve had a problem with the‘START/STOP’button on the control panel of my Triton T300si shower. I have to press it several times or hold it down to start or stop the shower. The rest of the panel seems to work fine. Based on this, would it appear to you that I need to replace the control PCB (Part No. TRITO-7072569)? Is this a user-replaceable part?

 Carry out this check after you check the inlet valves.

 Triton T300si 10KW no water 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  I have the t300si shower, it recently stopped working.

 It may be your solenoid valve, you can check it if you have a multi meter, you should have a reading of at least k3.5 ohms, across the two terminals any less and you need a new valve. (Check the valve in the failed state.) (When it is not working!) 

   

 If there is power getting to the solenoid and it is not operating then there is a good chance that you have a faulty solenoid. 

   

 If you don’t have a multimeter we sell them with a guide on how to use them for checking and testing the various parts of your shower. 

   

 Apart from helping to fix your shower, they are really useful for checking you have a power supply to appliances, for checking fuses and letting you know much power you have left in batteries 

 (So you will know if they are good or not) and lots of other jobs, in short they are well worth a few pounds

 TS300i water not turning off 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  Hello. I have a TS300i and the water keeps coming out of the shower head even when the power is switched off. Do you think the solenid valve is stuck open? The coil itself has a good resistance test (3.47k). Submitted 420 days ago  | by
 Doug, Salisbury A:  
 It sounds like a faulty solenoid, here is how to check. 

 

 If when you switch off the shower at the main isolator and the shower keeps running then you have a faulty solenoid. 

 

 When you switch off the shower at the main isolator and the water stops running, then you have a faulty on/off switch or a faulty PCB or a micro switch that is sticking on.

 Triton 300si not working 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  My T300SI tripped the fuse when I used it recently. My son, a Plumber , checked it out and replaced a burnt out connecter. The shower worked a few times when he tested it but tripped the fuse again when I tried next morning. He now suspects the can assembly, which is an expensive part to buy without knowing for sure. Do you think this is the likely cause of the problem?

 Rockape, Essex A:  
 Yes it most likely is the can assembly below is how to check. 

   

 It may be a faulty element in the heating tank (there are two, three in most 10kw showers) you can check them with a multi meter you should have a reading of around 12&gt;18 ohms. 

 If you have power to the elements and no heat it&apos;s probably the elements, no power to the elements then it&apos;s probably a micro switch.

 T300si 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  Hi, have one of these shower units which has suddenly started running at significantly reduced heat, no other symptoms and unlike some of the previous questions, although we live in a small village and are subject to frequent power cuts/brown-outs, I can&apos;t tie in the recent problem with the shower to any of these.



Since having the shower we have had the heating element/can replaced 3 times, each approx. 1 year apart and at a cost of£90-ish a go this is fast becoming unreasonable.



The price of your replacements are better, but of course I&apos;ll have to replace it myself. (I can do this).



Anyway to the actual question; is there a conclusive test to confirm that the heating element has actually gone or at least one of the two within the can? A basic continuity check on both elements gives me a dead short which I&apos;m assuming is correct, I have also tested the TCO on top of the can (as per your video) and it too shows up as dead short (no resistance in either case).



Don&apos;t want to pay out another£70-ish without being certain.



The previous 2 times (Triton engineer) the wiring had overheated and burnt out (from mains in junction block to heating element), this was replaced each time, this time this has not happened.



Was actually starting to think there was a design flaw, but a scan across the net didn&apos;t reveal anything.



Sorry for the ramble, but I&apos;m beginning to think a replacement might be the best option.



Any help/pointers would be much appreciated. Submitted 531 days ago  | by

 Water spraying out of inlet pipe. 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  Have just replaced the 9.5 v heater can in my T300si Remote. This was a fiddly but fairly straightforward job. However, when I turned the shower on to test it water sprayed out of the inlet pipe - the pipe that goes into the heating element can. Some did actually make it through to the shower head, but most of it went all over my bathroom floor.

Can&apos;t seem able to tighten the connection and have replaced and set up the heating element assembly exactly in the same way as the old one. Is there a washer/clamp I should have used?

Plumbers in short supply near me which is why I did this job myself and am gutted I&apos;ve not got it right. Any advice gratefully received doctor. Submitted 595 days ago  | by
 Lemons A:  
 The pipe between the inlet valve and the tank have to enter each other absolutely square for this to stay sealed. 

 

 A tip ....Slip the ‘O’ ring from the old tank on to the spigot of the new one (If it is the type where the spigot is long enough to take two ‘O’ rings) this helps to keep the assembly straight.

 Water not as hot 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  Our shower tripped the circuit breaker and when we reset it worked fine but only on half the heat - had to turn the control knob up twice as far to get as much hot water as before, with subsequent loss of flow. Is it the heateing element that has half burned out? Are they straightforward to replace? Submitted 631 days ago  | by
 Lemons A:  
 Yes it sounds like one of the elements in the heating tank has gone down. 

 

 The links to the different heating cans are here 

 http://www.showerdoc.com/shower-spares/triton/electric-showers/TRITO-PARENT-35-Triton-T300si-Remote 

 The replacement is fairly straight forward. 

 Turn of the water and power you then have to dismantle most of the inside of the shower to get enough space to slip the old part out and the new part in. 

 

 This sounds more difficult than it actually is, however you do have to be methodical noting where screws/nuts etc. come from and what goes where and it is always a good idea to take photos as you go because you can refer to them when you are rebuilding.

 T300si Power Pack Components 1 Answer 
 
 Q:  When I switch on the Cold&amp;Low pressure lights come on&amp;I only get a cold shower. A plumber has checked the water pressure&amp;says it is OK

He thinks it may be a small component any suggestions for example &quot;Thermal Safety Cut-out&quot; Submitted 789 days ago  | by
 Bernard Mason A:  
 I also think you may have a faulty Thermal Cut Out 

 A faulty TCO will have no continuity across the two terminals (The black thing on top of the heating tank) 

 Therefore a good TCO will have power at both connections and a faulty TCO will have power at only one. 

 (The function of the TCO is, if the water over heats it cuts the power off to the elements)
