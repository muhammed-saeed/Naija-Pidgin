G lossary of Northwest Acronyms and Terms 

A Mighty Fortress Is Our God - Christian Hymn written by Martin Luther. The national anthem of the Northwest American 

Republic. 

ASU - Active Service Unit. The basic building block of the NVA paramilitary structure. Generally speaking, an active service 

unit was any team or affinity group of Northwest V olunteers engaged in armed struggle against the United States government. The 

largest active service units during the War of Independence were the Flying Columns (q. v.) that moved across the countryside in 

open insurrection. These could sometimes number as many as 75 or even 100 men. More usual was the urban team or crew 

ranging from four or five to no more than a dozen Volunteers. After a unit grew larger than seven or eight people, the logistics of 

movement and supply and also the risk of betrayal reached unacceptably high levels, and the cell would divide in two with each 

half going its separate way. Command and coordination between the units was often tenuous at best. The success and survival of 

an active service unit was often a matter of the old Viking adage: &quot;Luck often enough will save a man, if his courage hold.&quot; 

Aztlaa - A semi- autonomous province of Mexico consisting of the old A merican states of southern and western Texas, A rizona. 

New Mexico, Utah, parts of Colorado, and southern California below a hne roughly parahel with the Mountain Gate border post 

BATF - Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms division of the United States Treasury Department. Used by the government in 

Washington D. C. unlawfully to suppress many early right-wing and racial nationalist groups and individuals. Unlike its more 

sophisticated counterpart the FBI, BATF seldom resorted to such things as bribery, fabrication, or forgery to get convictions. All 

brawn and no brain, BATF simply smashed their way into the homes of dissidents such as Kenyon Bellew and David Koresh and 

started shooting. Many of their agents later became Fatties when the FATPO (q.v.) superceded the old ATF organization at the 

beginning of the War of Independence. BATF was declared a criminal organization by Parliament and any surviving members are 

subject to arrest, trial, and punishment if apprehended. 

The Beast - Term similar in meaning to ZOG (q.v.) used initially by Christian Identity people to describe the Federal government 

of the United States and the Zionist, liberal power structure in general. The expression later came into more widespread use 

among the Northwest American Repubhc&apos;s non-CI population. 

Break Bad - An incident or encounter between the NVA and Federal forces or others that turns violent. 

Brigade - In the paramilitary organization of the Northwest Volunteer Army, a loose combination of all of the partisan units 

assigned to a specific geographic area. In the larger cities of the Homeland such as Seattle, Portland or Spokane there might be as 

many as two or three brigades, each operating independently of the others, so that a single catastrophic betrayal or Federal assault 

could not wipe out the NVA in that metropolitan area. A brigade could comprise as many as two or three dozen active service 

units of various kinds and strengths, including technical, supply, and support teams. Some of the smaller brigades covering larger 

and more rural areas only had a few units. In actual practice there was always an immense amount of confusion and overlap in 

membership and function between units. As is the case with any conflict, nothing about the War of Independence was ever as 

neatly cut and dried as the Republic&apos;s history books have portrayed. 

BOSS - Bureau of State Security. The Republic&apos;s political police. The mission of BOSS may be summed up simply in the five 

words of its motto: &quot; We will never go hack.&quot; In The Hill of the Ravens Don Redmond pithily summarizes that mission when he 

says, &quot;The revolution is forever. Our job is to make sure of that.&quot; 

CI - Christian Identity. By the time of writing of this book, the predominant Christian religious movement in the Republic. The 

faith of Pastor Richard Butler, Robert Miles, and many others among the founding fathers of the Northwest American Republic. 

The essence of C hristian Identity is the transfer of G od&apos; s B iblical covenant from the J ewish people to the G entile or A ry an peoples 

through the medium of the Christ&apos;s Passion and the Crucifixion. In most Christian Identity sects this transfer is accompanied by a 

very complex (sometimes downright tortuous) theological construct whereby white people are alleged to be racial descendants of 

the Israelites of the Bible through the alleged wanderings of the Lost Tribes through Europe, Denmark being descended from the 

tribe of Dan, etc. However tenuous the historical and theological basis for Christian Identity, there can be no doubt of the spiritual 

strength and personal integrity which the CI faith imparts to its adherents. During the Time of Struggle and ever since, they have 

been the very backbone of the Northwest nation. 

Ceatcom - During the War of Independence, Centcom was the central command authority of the American occupation forces, 

consisting of representatives from the executive and judicial branches of government, the FBI, Justice Department, Department of 

Homeland Security, etc. 

Code Duello - The official protocols and procedures governing dueling within the Republic, administered by the National Honor 

Court. The purpose of the Code Duello is to make sure that the ultimate sanction for personal misbehavior remains available to all 

the Repubhc&apos;s citizens, but only under very clear and formally recognized conditions. Ref. the Old Man: &quot;One of the problems 

under ZOG was that there was no longer any penalty attached to being an asshole. There needs to be.&quot; 

Come Home - To immigrate to the Northwest A merican Republic. Since the NAR is the Homeland of all Indo-European peoples, 

a white immigrant is considered to have Come Home. 

A Distant Thunder 1 



Daryl and His Other Brother Daryl - Defamatory term used by certain white migrants to the Homeland during pre- 
revolutionary times to denote white people bom in rural areas of the Northwest. Considered rude, boorish, and highly discouraged 
by the Party both before and since the revolution. 

DHS - Department of Homeland Security. One of the many overlapping Federal political police agencies created under Bush II as 
part of the suspension of the United States Constitution and the abrogation of American civil liberties which took place after the 
events of September 11*, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security seerrB to have done IMe during the time of the revolution 
beyond adding to the confusion. 

DM - &quot;Drooling Moron.&quot; Defamatory term used by certain white migrants during the pre- revolutionary times to denote white 
people bom in mral areas of the Northwest Homeland. Always frowned upon and discouraged by the Party. Several legal cases 
are now before the National Honor Court to decide whether &quot;DM&quot; is to be considered a killing word or not. 
E&amp;E - Escape and Evasion. Associated with General Order Number Eight, a.k.a. the &quot;Feets Don&apos;t Fail Me Now&quot; order. When 
an operation went bad, or when confronted with a Federal ambush, extreme danger, or overwhelming enemy numbers, every NV A 
Volunteer had a personal Escape and Evasion plan, a series of refuges and safe houses etc. to which they would flee and from 
which they would subsequently regroup. The underlying rationale of General Order Number Eight was the ancient one of all 
guerrilla forces: he who fights and mns away, lives to fight another day. 

FATPO - Federal Anti-Terrorist Police Organization. A body of special auxiliary police officers recmited by the United States 
govemment to suppress the revolution in the Pacific Northwest, after the FBI and local authorities had clearly lost control and it 
was not deemed politically expedient to use the regular military in a significant role. FATPOs were mostly recmited from 
discharged members of the United States military, local police departments, and from both sides of the bars within the American 
empire&apos; s immense prison system. FATPOs were given a short but intensive training campaign at Fort Bragg combining 
counterinsurgency, commando and SWAT-team style tactics, along with heavy political indoctrination in diversity, 
multiculturalism, etc. Nominally subject to the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, in reality the 
govemment in D. C. was far away, and a blind eye was tumed. Local FATPO commanders had a blank check and more or less 
operated as independent warlords in their districts, above the law so long as they produced a plentiful white body count Discipline 
and control from Centcom was patchy at best, accountability was nil, atrocities frequent, media reporting of those atrocities almost 
non-existent, and any serious military purpose or strategy quickly disappeared. The FATPOs in short order became nothing more 
than gangs of bmtal gun thugs devoted to the bloody suppression of the NV A and any white citizen of the Northwest whom they 
so much as suspected might be sympathetic to the NVA. Strict policies of affirmative action and mandatory diversity were 
applied, and at any given time the force was only about 35% white and perhaps 25% white male. There was an unknown but 
significant percentage of lesbian and homosexual sadists who mainly operated in the intelligence units of FATPO as interrogators, 
and who earned themselves a reputation as some of the most cmel and vicious torturers in the history of human tyranny. 
FBI - Federal Bureau of Investigation. The American secret police. Still extant, although now less involved in Northwest affairs 
than their rivals of the Office of Northwest Recovery (q.v.) Declared a criminal organization by Parliament after Independence. 
Any member of the FBI or anyone assisting the FBI is liable to arrest, trial, and punishment under the law of the Republic. 
Flying Column - During the War of Independence, an independent unit of partisans numbering approximately thirty to a hundred 
Volunteers. These guerrilla units were usually based in mral areas throughout the Pacific Northwest, and operated in the 
countryside and small towns. They were highly mobile and conducted operations against the American forces, against the means 
of production, and cleared their operational areas of American law enforcement, judicial, and govemmental institutions to make 
way for Aryan courts, police, and govemment. Because of the activities of the Flying Columns, the United States eventually lost 
control of the countryside almost completely and could maintain its authority only in the cities, and there only through repressive 
force. There were over thirty Flying Columns during the course of the War of Independence. The most famous among them were 
the Olympic Flying Column (Cmdt. Thomas J. Murdock); the PortTownsend Flying Column (Cmdt. John C. Morgan); the 
Hayden Lake Flying Column (Cmdt. 0. C. Oglevy); The Barbary Pirates (Areata and Eureka, Califomia district, Cmdt. Phil 
McDevitt); the Sawtooth Flying Column (Cmdt. Winston Wayne); the Corvallis Flying Column (Cmdt. Billy Basquine); the 
Montana Regulators (Cmdt. Jack Smith); and the EUensburg Flying Column (Cmdt. David &quot;Bloody Dave&quot; Leach.) 
G oots - Derogatory and defamatory term used by native- bom white people in the Northwest for racially conscious Aryan settlers 
who came into the Homeland during pre- revolutionary times. Origin unknown but possibly originated with Seattle disc jockey 
Ray Sheckstein. 

G UBU - Grotesque, Unbelievable, Bizarre, Unprecedented. Slang term used to describe most activities of the Aryan resistance 
movement prior to the advent of Northwest Migration concept, and regrettably for some time after that as well. Northwest 
equivalent of old American military term SNAFU. 

GW - Kinetic energy firearms named after the renowned Texas gunsmith and engineer Gary Wilkerson, who invented kinetic 
energy plate wherein the bullet is not propelled by a gunpowder- charged cartridge, but by a small kinetic energy charge from a 
metal power grid in the receiving group or bolt assembly of the weapon. Wilkerson KE technology is the basis most NDF (q.v.) 
small arms. 

Hats or Hat Squad - Semi-derogatory, pre- revolutionary term used by native- bom white Northwesters for Aryan settlers who 
answered the Old Man&apos;s call for migration. Refers to the eventual adoption of the fedora hat as the badge or insignia for 
Northwest settlers, at first of the Christian Identity faith, then later on the practice spread to migrants of all faiths. 

A Distant Thunder 2 



Longview Conference - The conference wherein the United States agreed to withdraw from the areas of the Northwest

the states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, parts of western Montana, and most of Wyoming. 

NAR - Northwest A merican Repubhc. Established as a worldwide home for all persons of unmixed Aryan, that is to say 

Caucasian, no n- Semitic, European descent The Northwest American Republic presently consists of the entire states of Idaho, 

Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming as well as hefty chunks of Northern California, western Montana, Alberta, British Columbia 

and Alaska.

NVA - Northwest Volunteer Army. Formed on October 22&quot;&quot;* in Coaird&apos;Alene, Idalx), in response to the nmider of the Singer 

family. Predecessor to the NDF. 

OBA - Old Behevers Association. The official NAR organization of non-Christian religious groups including A satru, the proto- 

NS Nordic Faith Movement and some elements of Wicca and Druidic cultism. 

Old Man - Early advocate of Northwest Migration and independence. Helped found the Party (q. v.) and served as a convenient 

figurehead for the independence movement during the War of Independence, although he always considered his role in the 

revolution to be very much exaggerated. Served two terms as State President and was able to stabilize and consolidate the gains of 

the revolution, but was effectively removed from power by President Patrick Brennan and the Pragmatic Tendency in Parliament 

because he was thought bD be a dangerously radical relic of the past Presently President Emeritus of the Republic and living in 

seclusion. Suffers from dementia praecox due bD his advanced age and is generally confused and incoherent Has issues with 

ducks. [See The Hill of the Ravens.] 

ONR - The United States Office of Northwest Recovery. Covert agency of the United States government devoted bD the long term 

goal of returning the Northwest Republic to the United States and Canada respectively. Regularly conducts assassinations, 

sabotage, and other subversive activities within the Northwest A merican Republic. 

On the Bounce - NVA slang term for being on the run from the American police and military. 

Operation Strikeout - Twelve years after the Longview Conference the United States and Canada, in conjunction with the 

United Nations, launched what they believed to be a surprise attack against the Northwest Republic, intending to re-conquer the 

Pacific Northwest and return the Homeland to American imperial rule. Due to superior intelhgence on the part of BOSS (q.v.) and 

the War Prevention Bureau (q.v.) the attack was not the surprise that the Pentagon thought it would be. The Americans and 

Canadians were decisively defeated in a campaign lasting forty- six days and large sections of northern California, Alberta, British 

Columbia and Alaska were added to the Republic&apos;s terribDry. 

The Party - The fighting revolutionary Party of Northwest independence founded by the Old Man, once a sufficient number of 

racially aware migrants had arrived in the Homeland b) effect a significant socio-political demographic change sufficient to make 

such a Party feasible. Although the Party was comprised in the majority of people who were native- bom in the Northwest it was 

made possible by the influx of racially aware migrants who listened to the Old Man&apos;s call and heeded it Based upon the principles 

of National Socialism as expressed in the Cotswolds Declaration of 1962 and the Ten Principles of National Socialist Thought yet 

offering a broad program of tolerance and participation for all Aryan religious and political tendencies, the Party provided the 

political leadership for the revolution, while the NVA provided the military capability. 

Resurrection Shuffle - NVA slang term for being on the run, escaping and evading the Federal forces. 

Rockwell, Commander George Lincoln (1918-1967) - American National Socialist leader. Founder of the American Nazi Party

A Distant Thunder 3 



religion, and nationality, creating a true Aryan &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. For this purpose, extensive political and racial education based 
on the principles of National Socialism is part and parcel of SS training and qualification. 

Stukach - A Russian term meaning informer, dating from the time of Stalin and the hideous purges of the 1930s. How exactly 
this term entered the lexicon of the Northwest A merican Republic is not certain. When applied to the family or person of a citizen, 
it is considered the ultimate insult, along with the words &quot;whigger&quot; and &quot;attorney.&quot; All three are considered to be killing words, 
i.e. prima facie casus belli under the law of the Republic for a duel to the death if the parties involved cannot be reconciled by 
formal procedures under the Code Duello. 

Take The Gap - Broadly speaking, to Come Home. To immigrate to the Northwest American Republic. In practice, to &quot;take the

Tickle -An operation of the Northwest Volunteer A rmy against a Federal or Zionist target. 

Third Section (Threesec) - Intelligence, counterintelligence, security and special operations department of the Party prior to 
10/22. Created by Matt Redmond, who served as Threesec&apos; s first director until his death. Organizational ancestor of both BOSS 
(q.v.) and War Prevention Bureau (q.v.) 

Volunteer - A male or female soldier of the Northwest Volunteer Army. 

Whigger - &quot;White nigger.&quot; A defamatory term for whites during the pre- revolutionary time who aped the mannerisms and 
subculture of blacks. Considered to be a kilhng word in the NAR, i.e. sufficient casus belli for a duel to the death if no 
compromise can be reached between the parties involved. 

Woodchuck - Originally a term with defamatory and derogatory connotations used by Aryan settlers in the Homeland to denote 
those who were bom in the Northwest, especially rural areas. Now transmuted and claimed as a proud and honorable designation 
by those bom in the Homeland. 

WPB - The NAR&apos;s War Prevention Bureau. A covert agency designed to prevent the necessary military, political, and 
psychological conditions from developing within the United States, Aztlan, or anywhere else that might lead to an existential 
military threat to the existence of the Northwest Republic, through the use of targeted assassination and other black ops. The WPB 
is also responsible for tracking down and liquidating spies and traitors to the Northwest Republic, including informers and traitors 
from the time of the War of the Independence. Their motto in German is &quot;Alles bekennings wird abgerechnet&quot; - &quot;All accounts 
will be settled.&quot; 

ZOG - Zionist Occupation Govemment. Term originally created by the obscure National Socialist writer Eric Thomson in the 
1970s. Strictly constmed, ZOG means the Federal govemment of the United States. In actual usage it is a much more all- 
embracing term meaning the System, the Establishment, the generic &quot;them&quot; used by oppressed peoples to denote the Federal 
tyrant. 

The Turning Wheels 

At the end of the twentieth century, there was a Japanese college professor named Francis Fukuyama. He wrote a long, 
intellectual, and tres chic essay called The End of History that became quite famous. 

Francis Fukuyama was an intellectual whore who sold his mind for money. He was a tame academic who sucked up to the 
wealthy and powerful of his era, big time. He told them what they wanted to hear and he reaped their largesse. When the blank- 
faced white men in the silk suits said jump, Francis Fukuyama asked &quot;How high?&quot; When the suits said mn, Francis Fukuyama 
asked &quot;How far?&quot; He politely avoided the mildly disturbing term plutocracy, and substituted a much more fashionable practice of 
publicly referring to the wealthy, cormpt, amoral, incompetent, discreetly homosexual Anglo- Zionist corporate mling elite of the 
late twentieth century by the grotesque name of liberal democracy. It was, of course, neither liberal nor democratic, but tmth 
didn&apos;t matter in those days. 

Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy was the final form of human govemment for all time to come. He claimed that the 
allegedly irresistible combination of liberal democracy and multinational capitalism had triumphed over all other competing 
systems such as monarchy, fascism, communism. National Socialism, welfare state socialism, and of course that nasty Islamic 
theocracy of the ignorant Arab peasants that persecuted poor little helpless Israel so. History was now at an end. Professor 
Fukuyama told the world. All that remained was to formalize that fact by taking care of a few little details and getting everybody 
on board and whipped into shape. Then once we got rid of all those picky little details like race, and religion, and culture, and 
morality, and the traditional nuclear family— in other words, once we destroyed all that makes humanity truly diverse in the non- 
politically correct sense of the term— then all the nations of the earth would boogie down in one great conga line onto the great 
worldwide Euro-American consumer plantation. There mankind would graze in the grass, dancing and singing and blowing dope 
and fucking anything with a pulse, bathed in the warm soothing glow from the television. The very flow of history itself would 
cease and the Garden of Eden would be rebom, but instead of a serpent in our new paradise we&apos;d have only Ronald McDonald. 
The world would henceforth and forever be benevolently mled from the corporate boardroom by pale, unseen beings in expensive 
suits, while at their shoulder for spiritual guidance whispered the holy rabbi Hyman Heeblebaum from Temple Schmuck-El, 
wearing his little blue and white knitted beanie, his heart filled with the brotherhood of man and confident in his ancient Talmudic 
knowledge of what is best for us all. 
Wrong, asshole. 
Dead wrong. 

A Distant Thunder 4 



The United States of America into which I was bom was all a lie. A cheap, shoddy, vicious, evil lie that deserved nothing but 

bloody death at the point of the sword. In the United States of A merica, if you had a white skin and a dick on you, if you had no 

money, then you were nothing. G et back, redneck! No one cared about you. No one would lift a finger to help you, and all you 

were good for was to fix the rich people&apos; s appliances and toys. Y ou were raw material for biped swine in suits to make money for 

themselves off your sweat and your pain. Y ou lived your whole life like a dog, you were beaten like a dog, and you died like a 

dog. Well, by God, we showed those rich sons of bitches and their smart Jew lawyers and their pet monkeys that dogs have teeth! 

Oh, yeah. Amazing what a few well- placed bullets and a dab or two of Semtex under some rabbi&apos; s kosher tuches can do to get the 

wheels of history jump- started and turning back on track. 

My name is Shane Ryan. I was one of those little details Fukuyama and his kind could never quite take care of. I was a Northwest 

Volunteer. 

This is how we started the wheels of history turning again. 

Bringing Down Burger King 

Turn, hell-hound!... I have no words. 
My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out! 
-Macbeth, Act V, Scene 8 
No, that doesn&apos; t mean the NVA held up a hamburger j oint. 

Back in the old days when we gave it to the bastards hot, us domestic terrorist- type dudes had our own rap just like any other self- 
respecting A merican subculture, from punk rockers to nigger gang- bangers to Trekkies to skateboarders. Most white kids of my 
generation were raised damned near from birth by the boob tube, instead of by our parents, so we got a lot of our spiel off TV and 
whatever mindless pollution of the soul the Hollywood dream machine chose to spoon into all the skulls of mush. That was why 
sometimes we sounded like movie gangsters when we talked about hits and whacking guys out and going strapped. Other words 
we picked up from the foreign Volunteers who flocked to the Northwest during the later stages of the revolution, a highly 
politically incorrect form of diversity. There was the Russian word stukach for informer, and the South African term kaffir to 
denote our fellow citizens ob de Affikin-Amurkin persuasion. 

Did you know that the English language contains over a hundred words for nigger? ZOG tried to ban them all. Thought control. If 
you forbid people to speak certain words out loud for fear of persecution and prison, eventually they&apos; 11 self-censor themselves 
even in their own minds. They&apos; 11 refuse to think the forbidden thoughts lest they accidentally utter the forbidden word and destroy 
their lives. On more than one occasion, at the early Party meetings I went to when I was in high school, we&apos; d get newbies who&apos; d 
never been among racially aware white people before. Suddenly they&apos;d burst out, cursing and shouting and screaming &quot;Nigger! 
Nigger! Niggerniggerniggerniggernigger... .&quot; like they had Tourette&apos;s syndrome. For the first time in years, first time ever for 
some of them, they were someplace where they could speak freely and without fear of retaliation from politically correct society, 
without looking over their shoulder to see who was listening. They were saying out loud what they had always felt in their hearts. 
Some of them wept while they hollered nigger. It was like the weight of a timber tmck had been lifted off their soul. Freedom is 
being able to call a spade a spade. Literally. 

NVA shop talk was unique to our situation, a kind of code we used due to the frequent need for us evildoers to conduct a 
conversation on our phones or computers without ZOG &apos; s eavesdroppers figuring out whatever evening&apos; s worth of anti-social 
activities we were contemplating. A lot of our terminology revolved around junk food. It was an obvious cover. The A merican 
consumer state stuffed its citizens full of grease, cholesterol, refined carbohydrates, white sugar, and chemicals at a two hundred 
percent profit until everybody over age twelve was at least thirty pounds overweight. Y ou never see any fat people in the 
Northwest Republic today, since the Ministry of Health regulates things like refined sugar and refined carbs, and the govemment 
has banned that damned high fmctose com symp American food processors used to dump into everything. The Japanese invented 
that crap. Y ellow man&apos; s revenge for Hiroshima. Might as well have been feeding people strychnine. But in those days every other 
person of any race you saw on the street was really gross and jiggling, men with bellies like hams hanging over their belt, women 
whose tmly mighty butts had their own gravitational field. There was some kind of starch and cholesterol trough on every comer, 
and in between the comers, like brightly colored poisonous mushrooms, were all these damned little convenience stores mn by 
wogs. Garish neon pimples on the face of the world, with racks full of nachos and sugar and pure grease. That toxic waste was 
what most people spent their lives stuffing into their gob. All the multifarious agencies of ZOG that monitored the phone lines and 
air waves and computer chat rooms in the name of freedom and democracy inevitably heard a lot of chatter from the peasantry 
about whatever putrid crap everyone had for lunch or was having for dinner. Us evildoers played to that when we were nattering 
to one another. 

G uns were cheeseburgers, didn&apos; t matter what brand name, but if they had onions they were full auto. A mmunition was French 
fries. When we needed to be more specific, a shotgun was a taco and a handgun was a chili dog. A proper military -manufactured 
hand grenade, whether American or Russian or a Chinese stick, was a beer of any brand. Grenades were just about our favorite 
toys. We paid top dollar and we were always interested in anyone who had any to sell, be they white or black or brown. I once 
bought a case of grenades from a Sikh master sergeant at Fort Lewis who knew damned well who I was and who I wanted them 
for. Hell, he didn&apos;t care. Ten grand was ten grand. We had a lot of fun with those little darlings. On the phone and online at least, 
we must have sounded hke real dmnks, always talking about booze, even though Volunteers weren&apos;t allowed to touch alcohol.

How tight was that enforced, ma&apos;am? Well, tight enough so The Beast knew about it and we took to keeping crushed empty beer 
cans in our back seats or on the beds of our pickups as a kind of camouflage. I once was able to get past a Fattie checkpoint by 
dousing myself with Miller High Life and pretending to be drunk. They knew the NVA didn&apos;t tolerate drunks and so they figured I 
couldn&apos; t be NVA . The nigger lieutenant just punched me in the face a couple of times on general principles and let me go. 
Where was I? Right, funny names we had for hardware and operational matters. A black powder pipe bomb was a Twinkle. A 
home-made satchel charge was a pizza; pepperoni was high explosive plastic and anchovies meant the bomb was packed with 
roofing nails or other shrapnel for maximum splatter effect. Some of these NVA terms, I&apos;ve no idea where they came from, 
although a few of them showed a definite warped sense of humor. Any attack our guys made on an enemy target was called a 
tickle. When you shot somebody in the gut and watched him kick and scramble you tickled his liver. Whacking out a television 
reporter or a newscaster whose reportage was especially hostile towards the revolution was called dropping anchor. When we 
whacked a politician, he was recalled. Machine-gunning the CEO of a major multi-national corporation, usually outside the 
apartment of the secretary he was screwing, was referred to as downsizing. Six sticks of dynamite wired to somebody&apos;s ignition 
was called the Rapture, because he flew up in the sky to be with Jesus. A home invasion in the wee hours of the morning was 
called the five o&apos; clock knock. Putting a ladder up against a target&apos; s bedroom window, creeping up it and then shooting them in bed 
was called a window- washing job. Executing a racially mixed black and white couple was giving them their jungle fever shots, 
and whacking some white degenerate like my brother with his Asian sunshine girl was a Chinese take- out. ZOG had terms like 
that on their side as well, of course. They called us goots, which sounds like some kind of holdover from Vietnam when the 
enemy were gooks, but in this case was their term of contempt and meant Daryl and his other brother Daryl, in other words guys 
like me who were bom here. At one stage the Federals developed a habit of hurling NVA people, real or suspected, out of a tenth 
floor window at the Federal building in Seattle. They called these victims &quot;paratroopers.&quot; One humorist from the FBI put up a sign 
on the street below that said &quot;Watch for falling bodies.&quot; 

Anyway, you asked me about Burger King. BurgerKing was our slang term for what the Germans used to call diHofjucle, a major- 
league, powerful Jewish politician or millionaire, someone high in the American media, the intelligentsia, the pohtical or social or 
economic establishment. 
BurgerKing. B. K. Big Kike. Get it? 

Y eah, I know I&apos;m rambling. For the information of whoever is listening, the little girl from the university says she just wants me 
to sit here and babble into the microphone and try not to pick my nose while I&apos; m on video. No disrespect, honey, I know you&apos; ve 
got kids of your own, but I&apos;m ninety-one years old and to me your mother is a little girl. I am exercising the timeless prerogative 
of geezers who are no longer merely old but downright ancient to irritate the young, since we can&apos;t do jack shit of anything else. 
Anyway, the little girl here says she wants to record &quot;history as stream of consciousness.&quot; Well, she&apos;s going to find out that my 
stream of consciousness has a lot of dead fish in it, floating belly up. The reason why I mentioned that particular term is that I 
figure I&apos; 11 start my stream of consciousness flowing by telling you the story of the heaviest tickle I was ever on back in my 
Volunteer days. The biggest, juiciest Burger King our crew ever took out. That would be the Right Honorable Samuel L. 
Rothstein, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court and one of the most blood-soaked monsters in human history. The 
man who in one bang of his gavel swept away the last remaining state and Federal restrictions against abortion on demand, so that 
to this day in the Jewnited States of Amurrica women of all races, creeds, and colors can drop by the comer clinic and flush their 
rainbow- colored babies down the toilet with no more thought or hindrance than if they were having their nails done. I hear they 
call that getting a scrape. 

r m sorry, ma&apos; am. I know that&apos; s a terrible thing to say and I didn&apos; t mean to upset you, but you do know that&apos; s what they called it 
back then, don&apos; t you? A nd still do in the United States? That it&apos; s their term, not mine? Y ou&apos; re asking me how could any human 
woman on earth murder her own child and not go mad? They did go mad, ma&apos;am. Mad as March hares. They just didn&apos;t realize it, 
because all the world around them was mad and they had no point of reference by which to discem sanity. There ain&apos;t nothing 
wrong with being judgmental when judgment is called for. If human beings aren&apos;t supposed to make moral judgments then what 
the hell is the difference between a man and an animal? That&apos; s what happened in the Garden when Adam and Eve chomped down 
on the forbidden fmit. They came to know sin when they saw it. I mentioned that scrape thing in case anyone who watches this is 
inclined to bitch at me and the NVA for our colorful use of the language. I always thought those media reptiles had a hell of a gall 
to call us murderers while every day those people were literally throwing baby parts into dumpsters. Jesus Christ on a raft! Still 
makes me killing mad every time I think of it. I exult in every one of those sons of bitches whose head I busted open with a bullet. 

Y ou want bmtality, ma&apos; am? Y ou&apos; 11 get plenty of it if you want to keep on with this project. We Jerry Rebs were plain mad dog 
mean, but it was the righteous bmtality of God against those unspeakably evil people and their wicked govemment, who broke 
asunder the very temple of life, and I glory in every minute of it I can remember. A t least I never killed babies. I waited until they 
were grown-up people and in the full flower of their evil before sending them to hell. 

No, ma&apos; am, I&apos; m not a Christian. Not sure why not I lived around them most of my life, but for some reason it never took. That 
was Rooney and China and Ma Wingfield talking through me, but theology aside, they were right There was evil abroad in the 
world in them days, and you didn&apos; t have to be a Christian to understand that Our battle against the United States was a battle 
against Satan, against the principle of evil that is hateful and destmctive of all human life, in a time when it sat enthroned and 
triumphant over all the world. We had Christians and Odinists and National Socialists and atheists and agnostics and Wiccans and 
neo-Dmids, all of whom understood that Y eah, we were cmel. We had to be to survive, never mind win. But the empire we 
fought against was cmel on a scale never before known in human history. ZOG didn&apos; t just kill. ZOG kept people alive and 

A Distant Thunder 6 



miserable, like some monstrous snot- nosed mongoloid idiot pulling wings off flies. Those American sons of bitches had every bit 
of what we gave &apos;em coming, and then some. Never mind abortion, even. Any American cluster bomb on Baghdad or nerve gas 
warhead in the Gaza Strip killed more people than my whole crew took out during the War of Independence. 
I know I&apos;m wandering again. You okay now, ma&apos;am? Again, I apologize. I didn&apos;t mean to upset you. Then hsten, my children, 

and you shall hear. This is how that baby-killing bastard Sammy Rothstein got his. 

* * * 

At the time of the Rothstein hit I was with Tank Thompson&apos; s crew, here in Dundee. We were one of several active service units 
working out of Lewis County. Washington&apos; sown Rebel County, as we call ourselves to this day. It&apos; s a proud tradition and I&apos;m 
glad I was a part of it. Officially Tank&apos; s boys and girls were called Company E, South Sound Brigade, Northwest Volunteer 
Army. At any given time there were maybe twenty or thirty of us on active service with Company E, but so many came in for a 
couple of tickles and then went, for whatever reason, that I couldn&apos; t even begin to give you any kind of numbers for any given 
month, never mind the whole W ar of Independence. A hundred or a hundred and twenty total? M ore? If you&apos; re curious, ma&apos; am, 
you can try looking up the official brigade history with the Old NVA Association. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s in the library somewhere. I never 
bothered. 

The first South Sound brigadier was Dick Warner, who was arrested three months after 10/22 and wasn&apos;t released until after 
Longview. He later became a Member of Parliament and after that he was the director of the NAR Wildlife Conservation Trust. In 
my day the brigadier was Brian Kovacs. I think I met him five, maybe six times during the entire war, when I was riding shotgun 
for Red Morehouse who was the A rmy Council&apos; s Political Officer for our sector. Kovacs was killed in the street fighting in 
Tacoma after the Longview accords, when some of the Federal troops at Fort Lewis decided the treaty didn&apos;t mean them and we 
had to correct that little misapprehension. He won a posthumous Iron Cross. Our third Brigadier for about six weeks before the 
NVA transmuted into the NDF and the organizational table changed was Franz Ulrich Molitor, who later took command of the 
Second SS Panzer Division, the all-German outfit that racked up all those victories and decorations during Operation Strikeout 
NVA Lieutenant Dorsey &quot;Tank&quot; Thompson got his handle from when he was a tank commander in Iraq and Syria, and later on 
during the abortive American invasion of Egypt. He got his tank blown out from under him. Thompson was pretty badly burned, 
including the left side of his face, which gave him a very distinctive appearance and one the Feds were always on the lookout for. 
He practically had to turn into a vampire for the whole war, moving only by night and staying in the shadows so no one would 
recognize him. We referred to our outfit as &quot;our guys&quot; or &quot;our crew&quot; or just &quot;Dundee&quot;. Some of the companies in our brigade had 
snazzy names, like B Company in Tacoma, that had so many Russian immigrants in it they were called the Don Cossacks. There 
were other outfits that had such names, like the Barbary Pirates, the Montana Regulators, and the Butcher Boys up in north 
Seattle. We once kicked around the idea of picking a name for ourselves, the Dundee Destroyers or something juvenile of the 
kind, but T ank vetoed it. &quot; Y ou let the media pick up on something like that and it draws unwanted attention from Z G , &quot; he said. 
&quot;We get high profile and Centcom in Washington is going to move us to the top of their hit list and send in more heat than we 
need or can handle. Sorels and his goons are enough to for us to deal with. We want to stay off their radar screen as much as we 
can while still being effective. With any luck they&apos;ll think we&apos;re imports from Seattle or Vancouver, although Sorels isn&apos;t as dumb 
as he looks.&quot; (It would be impossible for anyone to be as dumb as Sorels looked.) &quot;I think he knows we&apos; re right here in town and 
I&apos;m sure he remembers some of us from his previous incarnation as village constable.&quot; 

One warm spring day in May, with the cherry blossoms come and blown, and the green leaves newly on the hardwoods, I was 
lying on a mattress in a back room in a safe house in Dundee, trying to get some sleep, when Johnny Pill came in and told me we 
had a tickle on. One thing you learn when you&apos; re doing the resurrection shuffle— sorry, me lapsing into old fighters&apos; gab again, 
and no, I got no idea where that one came from— one thing you learn when you&apos; re on the run is that you sleep whenever you get 
the opportunity, even if it&apos; s only a cat nap, because you never know when you&apos; 11 have to spend the next two days out on a tickle 
and then make a fast break and gopher hole it Y eah, I can say ishkabibble and twenty-three skiddoo, too. Anyway, Johnny Pill, 
that&apos; s John Pilafski, a big grumpy middle-aged Polack who rented the safe house, came in and told me we had this major tickle 
shaping up in Olympia and the C wanted us to meet him at the old swimming hole A SA P. The old swimming hole was our code 
name for a state government warehouse on A irdustrial W ay in Tumwater. There was nothing even remotely connected to 
swimming about it the idea being if the Feebs were to overhear some reference to it they&apos; d think water and look elsewhere than a 
one- story corrugated iron hangar full of steel shelves stacked with outdated state documents and forms and misprinted calendars 
from 1999. All the paper was supposed to be recycled, but one of our girls in the state offices had gotten into the computers and 
deleted the whole building from the database. Thus far no one in the government even appeared to remember the place existed. 
The lieutenant had a key and we rendezvoused there occasionally. 

The previous evening I had been out on a minor tickle, what we called a Come to Jesus session, no offense to any of our Christian 
comrades. Actually, our Christian comrades called it a Come to Jesus session as well. Some old fart whose name I forget had been 
going around Dundee wearing a white construction hard hat with a large A murrican flag on the front and an equally prominent 
Israeli flag with a blue Star of David on the back accompanied by some obscure Bible verse or other. He drove a battered old 
white Nissan covered with assorted bumper stickers from various religious right churches and pro-Israel committees, etc. He&apos; d 
stop on the street or in a shopping mall, pass out those stupid tiny little Christian comic books and babble to anyone who would 
listen about how the Lord of Hosts would soon come down from the sky and vaporize all evil Mushms in the name of J eeee-zus, 
as opposed to Jesus, and God would smite hip and thigh on anybody else (hke us evildoers of the NVA) who dared to lay hands 
on the Apple of God&apos;s Eye, thejoosh pipples who were the Chosen Ones blah blah blah ishkabibble. Oh, Walter. Yeah, Walter 

A Distant Thunder 7 



was this geezer&apos; s name. He was crazy as hell and he had the papers to prove it, since he lived on some kind of government nut 
check. We had ignored old Walter for months, figuring that if anything he was helping us. The village idiot was not exactly the 
best advertisement in the world for truth, justice, and the Zionist way. That&apos; s one of the more subtle revolutionary skills, by the by, 
figuring out who among your enemies are such incompetent nincompoops that they are actually doing more harm to the regime 
and more good to the revolution by remaining where they are. 

But then one evening Walter was in Fulton&apos; s Market, and the checkout girl, who was not a Volunteer but knew how to get word to 
us, overheard some snippets of suspect conversation between Walter and our local red- white- and- blue headache, Washington 
State Patrol sergeant Leon &quot;Dummy-Dummy&quot; Sorels, of whom you may be sure I will have more to say at a later date. Walter was 
just a kook, but Sorels was definitely on our crew&apos; s to do list He had already survived one bomb under his patrol car and one .30- 
06 slug through his living room window. After these bashful tokens of our affection, he adopted a lifestyle distinctly nomadic. We 
were thinking in terms of whupping a spot of Shock and Awe on Dummy-Dummy&apos;s steroid- pumped ass when time and place 
should serve, but he was a cagey bastard, always varying his movements, always surrounding himself with his fellow gun thugs, 
never sleeping in the same place twice in a row, and then just after the Walter incident... never mind, that&apos; s for later. Anyway, to 
make a long story short, old man Walter might have been crazy but he wasn&apos;t stupid. He was up on all the latest poop and 
propaganda from the Department of Homeland Security, he had all the DHS wanted posters up on his wall (we later saw) and he 
was evidently not averse to collecting some reward money for the apprehension of us domestic terrorist evildoer- type dudes. I 
guess he saw no reason why doing the Lord&apos; s work shouldn&apos; t put a few shekels in his pocket. The girl told us that in Fulton&apos; s 
Walter was telling Sorels some spritz about how he&apos;d allegedly seen Carter Wingfield and one of his sons riding down Second 
Street in a gray pick-up truck with such and such a license number. 

Maybe he had, maybe he hadn&apos; t. Our crew used a whole motor pool of different vehicles which we had stashed all over Lewis 
County, and for all I know one of them might have been a gray pickup truck, but whether or not Walter was telling the truth or just 
trying to weasel his way into Sorels&apos; good graces to get on his snitch pad wasn&apos; t the point. Riding around town in a foolish car 
plastered with stupid A murrican bumper stickers and babbhng like a loon about Israel being the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy 
was one thing. This was informing, and informing of any kind was something the NVA could not, dare not ignore. Besides, I was 
field- married to Rooney Wingfield, the finest long, tall drink of redneck honey ever to come out of the South Carolina Low 
Country, so Carter Wingfield was my father-in-law and his sons were family. Y eah, I&apos; 11 tell you about that later on as well. But for 
that reason I took a personal interest. A 11 of a sudden Walter was very much on my own to do listas well as the crew&apos;s. We got the 
okay from the lieutenant, and the night before some of the boys and I went to the old geezer&apos; s cluttered, sad little house and 
chastised his sorry, crazy, snitching ass. We tied Walter into a chair in the kitchen while he screamed Bible verses at us, then we 
took his hard hat with the Masonic dishrag on it, clapped in onto his bald mottled noggin and nailed it into his skull. Nice big 
tenpenny nails. Then we sewed his lips together with fishing line for good measure so that everyone would know why we had 
done what we did. I assume Walter was dead by the time someone eventually found him, but by then I was really hot from the 
Rothstein hit and I had to ease my young ass on down the road a bit until I cooled off, so I lost track. 
Did we have to be so cruel to the old man? Y es, ma&apos;am. As a matter of fact, we did. The United States had more men, more 
money, more weapons, more gear, more informers, more courts, more electronic spying equipment, more prisons, more 
instruments of torture, and more resources of every single kind than we did. Not to mention total control of all the newspapers, all 
the television networks, the full backing of Hollywood, and except for the activities of a few of our cyber- guerrillas the 
government controlled almost all of the internet We had to even the odds in one of the few ways we could. Through pure, raw 
fear. Why do you think its called terrorism? Shock and Awe didn&apos;t just apply to actual combat When we sent a message we 
needed to bellow it from the rooftops and let everybody know in no uncertain terms that we were very, very serious about this new 
white nation business. We needed to make damned sure that a little light bulb came on over everybody&apos; s head as they realized that 
opposing the Northwest Volunteer Army&apos;s agenda was not a good life decision. Kind of like that old movie where the Jew movie 
producer wakes up with a horse&apos; s head in his bed. In fact I think we actually did that once to some rich bitch who was part of the 
horsey set The result was her husband resigned from his Federal judgeship and didn&apos; t send any more of our people into the living 
hell of ZOG &apos; s Third World prisons, and others of his kind suddenly discovered they had serious health issues that required them to 
lay aside their judicial duties for the duration. They were right Staying on the bench wearing those black robes could be very 
unhealthy. 

Terrorism is the weapon of the weak against the strong. 

That afternoon I went up to Oly withjohnny Pill. Johnny drove one of our legitimate i.e. non- stolen vehicles, a delivery truck 
from an organic bakery. Dundee was blue-collar working class, when there was any work available that hadn&apos; t been stolen by 
Mexicans. Oly was hoity-toity liberal, lattes and birkenstocks and granola, bicycle paths, and women who hyphenated their last 
names, so the truck fit right in. Believe it or not there were plenty of right wing health nuts, and one of them owned the bakery 
and gave Johnny a front job under a false name, and the use of the panel truck. I stayed hidden, crouched in the back amongst the 
sourdough loaves and bran muffins with my .455 Webley Carter had given me as a first shootout present and a sawed-off 
double-barreled shotgun. When we got to the warehouse on A irdustrial Drive, somebody opened a roll-up door and Johnny pulled 
the truck inside. &quot;Y ou got any doughnuts in there?&quot; I heard somebody ask. 
&quot;Naw, just goddamned bran muffins and bagels,&quot; said Johnny. I clambered out 
&quot;The muffins are pretty good,&quot; I commented, having eaten one on the way up. 

A Distant Thunder 8 



&quot;Right all the bods I sent for are here/&apos; called the CO from over in one comer of the large shelved hangar piled high with dusty 
boxes of obsolete paper. The burned side of his face always flushed red a bit when he was intent on something. &quot;Pull up a pew, 
guys, and let&apos; s get started.&quot; Our whole crew wasn&apos; t there. I don&apos; t recall a single occasion during the entire war when every man 
and woman we could muster from the Dundee area were ever in a single place. It wasn&apos;t a good idea. If something went bad, we 
didn&apos;t want it to go all the way bad. But this afternoon there were about a dozen Volunteers present, which for us at that time was 
a lot of bods to go out on a tickle, so we knew that this one was something heavy. Most of my comrades present I knew by their 
noms de guerre. Protocol was strict Y ou never asked a Volunteer his or her real name, and the information was seldom offered. 
There was Tank himself, of course, lean and mean in slacks and a black t- shirt, reddish hair hanging down over what was left of 
one side of his face. There was Echo Company&apos;s quartermaster and armorer, Smackwaterjack. Smack was a shaggy, hulking, 
white- bearded old sinner covered with prison tattoos. He looked like an evil Santa Claus. I either never knew what his real name 
was or else if I did, I long ago forgot The quartermaster of an NVA unit was arguably the most important officer in the crew, in 
some ways more so than the C or X 0, because he had charge of the three things that made us capable of fighting at all: the guns, 
the vehicles and the safe houses. Smack always wore a very old denim vest with an insignia of some kind on the back which had 
been defaced by almost two generations of sweat We always figured it was some biker gang&apos; s colors, but we never knew which 
one. 

Our executive officer. Tank&apos; s wife Pam, wasn&apos; t there. The X was the liaison contact with the rest of the NVA , but also the 
money man or woman in an Northwest V olunteer A rmy unit W e seldom saw Pam unless we were doing something that needed 
cash or we had done a revex— sorry, revolutionary expropriation, which is a fancy word for an armed robbery— in which case we 
gave the cash bD her, less commission. Y es, the Party allowed us commission on stickups. This was a completely pragmatic 
concession to human nature. They figured if they let us keep twenty cents on the dollar we would avoid the embarrassing sitch of 
stealing from the revolution. The laborer is worthy of his hire, as Carter Wingfield would have put it in his scriptural way. 
Revex es were popular tickles, as you can guess. Some of us showed a real flair for it and became real J ohn D illinger types. A nd 
you know? Because we were allowed that commission, I don&apos;t think any of us ever skimmed off any more than that from our take. 
It was a point of honor. We weren&apos;t common gangsters, you know. We were political gangsters, madam. 
There was a big muscle man in a tank-top with a blond buzz cut whom we all knew as Teddy the Bear. He usually carried our 
crew&apos; s one prized belt fed M-60 machine gun. We&apos; re talking Rambo here. The Bear could drive nails with that gun at a hundred 
yards. There was our field medic called Bones— what else? He was a damned good medic actually, who&apos; d served in Iraq and 
Saudi and had already saved a couple of our lives. For shooters we had me and Johnny Pill, Ray Hamilton, Tommy Connors, 
Mack the Knife, a kid with a green Mohawk called Spiderman and Susie Q., his equally punked-up girlfriend with a purple 
pageboy who sported a diamond in her nose. For special weapons there was a tall skinny guy with vacant eyes we called Lurch, 
who I remembered from my childhood as living with his mother in Dundee in a big house full of a couple of dozen cats. Lurch&apos; s 
Mom owed money to the IRS which she refused to pay, or so they said. Dummy-Dummy Sorels and some Feebs had come to their 
house one night while Lurch was at work. They claimed Lurch&apos; s mother fired a .22 at them, which maybe she did, maybe she 
didn&apos;t She was pretty gaga, but whatever the case was, Dummy-Dummy went berserk. Mother and cats all died when the house 
burned to the ground. Lurch was now in the process of returning the favor with interest He had been in Iraq and Saudi as well, 
before he was kicked out of the military on a Section Eight His military speciality had been air defense and he was a dab hand 
with Stingers and SAM anti-aircraft missiles, not to mention Patriots if we ever managed to get hold of any, and he had brought 
down two ZOG helicopters, one with a Stinger and one with an RPG. Okay, one of those was a television news copter, but just as 
much an enemy aircraft as any Blackhawk or Apache. I might mention as a footnote that Lurch made it through the war. I heard 
he went off into the woods to some cabin and lived out the rest of his life with more cats, and everybody left him alone. A lot of us 
were fighting for just that the right bD be left alone. I don&apos;t think ZOG ever quite figured that out 

There were also a couple of Volunteers I hadn&apos;t seen before, which was not an unusual thing. Sometimes somebody would show 
up for one major operation and you&apos;d never see them again until years later, if ever. One of these new faces was a chain-smoking, 
dark- haired, hard- looking woman in blue jeans named Carol, who I later learned had come down from Tom Murdock&apos; s Olympic 
Flying Column. The second was a heavy-set blue-eyed and blue-chinned bruiser with black hair in a bicep- bulging polo shirt with 
an Irish accent whom the CO called Paddy. Carol died with the Column at the Ravenhill ambush, and many years afterward 
Paddy became the Honorable Patrick Brennan, President of the Republic. 

The tickle was planned and organized by Brennan and Tank Thompson, and it was a big one indeed. &quot;Right evildoers, gather 
round and lend me your ears,&quot; said Tank. &quot;We&apos;re going to take down a Burger King, a big one, an honest to-God Elder of Zion. 
This is a nose we can mount on our wall. Chief Justice Sammy Rothstein of the Supremes.&quot; Tank held up an old cover bDm from a 
magazine. I saw a round bald head with a frizzy aureole of gray hair, a bespectacled sheep face with thick lips and a proboscis of 
note. There were mutters of surprise and pleasant anticipation. &quot;Among other crimes against God and man, Hizzoner the Chief 
Justice more or less destroyed the last vestiges of democracy in the two-party system by declaring primary elections 
unconstitutional, a maneuver designed specifically to keep politically incorrect candidates like us among others off the ballot But 
that s not why he was Time Magazine&apos; s Man of the Y ear a few years ago, as you see here. That accolade he earned for enshrining 
forever in the Constitution of our beloved empire a woman&apos; s right to choose not only bD murder her child, but to do so up until and 
including the very moment of natural birth. Not even partial birth. Birth. A woman now has the right bD choose her own damnation 
right up until the moment the doctor slaps her baby on the butt All she has to do is say no and instead of getting the butt- slap the 

A Distant Thunder 9 



baby gets run through a skill saw once or twice, and the pieces tossed in the dumpster. Unfortunately, Hizzoner Justice Rothstein&apos; s 
mother did not make such a choice. We are going to correct that error of hers tomorrow. 

&quot;Mister Rothstein seems to have had an attack of bravado. He&apos;s gonna show the world that we aren&apos;t so domestically terrifying 
after all. He is arriving in Olympia as a surprise speaker to address the graduating class of Evergreen College tomorrow afternoon. 
He will give them his Talmudic seal of approval and his command to go forth and become good little liberal yuppies thinking 
diverse thoughts, and no doubt a fatherly homily as well on how they need to stand fast against the dark and naughty forces of 
wicked racism, which is us. He doesn&apos; t know it yet, but tomorrow this Moloch in a black robe will be the guest of honor at a 
kosher barbecue. His own. I want this hebe to bum, boys and girls. I want to hear him scream like all those babies ripped from 
their mother&apos; s wombs screamed. I want to hear all that Philadelphia cream cheese sizzle, like he&apos; 11 be sizzling in the fires of hell.&quot; 
We cheered, already pumped. The boss had a way with words. 
&quot;So what&apos;s the plan. Tank?&quot; asked the Bear. 

&quot;The target arrives at Olympia airport tomorrow at eleven,&quot; said the lieutenant. For all it was the state capital of W ashington at the 
time, the city and surrounding environs of Olympia did not rate a major airport and had only a tiny little regional field with a 
couple of landing strips on it, maybe a mile from where we sat. 
&quot;Not Sea-Tac?&quot; asked Mack. 

&quot;No. The plutocracy&apos; s big knobs who have business in Oly usually fly into Sea-Tac, but that would give him too much time on the 
ground and too far to travel, and his security people don&apos; t like that They have sense enough to be nervous even if Rothstein 
himself doesn&apos; t W e considered the idea of trying to nail Rothstein&apos; s government Lear jet with our one Stinger missile or with an 
RPG up the intake as he lands. That way we know damned well he&apos; s in there. But the Feebs aren&apos; t fools. They know they&apos; re 
dangling a tempting goodie beneath our noses by bringing him here, and we have to assume they&apos; re going to be all over that 
airport with satellite surveillance, lookout posts, infra-red, you name it. This morning through our field glasses we saw their 
bulldozers and cranes installing concrete Bremer walls around the terminal building, so they&apos; re anticipating trouble. I don&apos;t fancy 
the idea of an attack against a static position when we don&apos;t know with one hundred percent certainty who we&apos;ll be going up 
against, how many, how they&apos;re armed, and where they will be disposed.&quot; 
&quot;What&apos;s his security?&quot; asked somebody. 

&quot;Feeps,&quot; said Tank. I should explain that in these pre-FATPO days, the Federal Protective Service was top dog in the Zionist 
kennel then, a mutation that grew out of an unholy mating between the FBI and Secret Service and BATF. Feep was one of those 
purely reactive things that ZOG dreamed up after an especially wet piece of work 0. C. Oglevy did on the senior senator from 
Idaho. Locking the bam door after the horse was already slaughtered. That was always ZOG &apos; s way. Once we seized the initiative 
the United States govemment never really gained it back, and they were always reacting rather than acting. Federal Protective 
Service didn&apos; t last more than a year or two, largely due to their failure to prevent very many of our hits, and they were eventually 
sent back to the FBI and Secret Service and their budget was absorbed by FATPO, but at the time we took down Burger King they 
were still in the saddle viz. VIP protection. &quot;The chatter we&apos; re picking up from their side of the fence seems to confirm they&apos; re 
worried,&quot; Thompson went on. &quot;The speech is being kept very much under wraps. A 11 the students at Evergreen know is that there 
will be a special commencement speaker, which was what alerted us that someone major was coming. We got curious so we asked 
the birdies, and one of our contacts in La Cesspool Grande was able to tell us who the surprise guest was. The target will be 
transported from the airport to the Evergreen campus in a limo convoy. I wish it was a copter, because then our Stinger could zap 
him with no muss or fuss, but they&apos; re not that careless. Three, possibly four vehicles, and as a further bit of good news the convoy 
will be covered from the air by at least one helicopter gunship, most likely a Blackhawk out of Fort Lewis. Once Rothstein arrives 
on campus there will be a special power luncheon for the chief justice in the staff dining room, attended by all manner of local 
Zoggish wheels from the govemor and both U.S. senators on down. This seems to be where they&apos; re concentrating most of their 
preventive measures. They&apos; re worried we&apos; 11 try to hit all of the bastards at the banquet, and I wish to hell we could get more 
people together and do just that, but we didn&apos; t get sufficient advance notice to work out the manpower and the logistics. They&apos; re 
not going to let Hizzoner spend the night here lest something go boom. A fter Rothstein&apos; s speech to the kiddies in the aftemoon he 
goes scuttling right back to the airport in the same limos, then back onto his Lear jet and back to D. C. The limos will be 
Bremerized, armored and bomb- proofed, special mine- proofed tires and undercarriage, super- powered engines, and equipped with 
full automatic fire capability from a swivel- mounted M-60 through the sun roof. As part of their SOP, they will try to avoid us 
knowing which vehicle en route actually contains Hizzoner Chief Justice Rothstein. We hope to get a tip, but it may turn out to be 
a shell game. Find the pea under the tin cup. The hit is going to have to go down on the ground, on his way either to or from the 
airport. We haven&apos;t got anybody on the inside at the airport terminal, worse luck,&quot; Tank continued, &quot;The one bod we had who was 
willing to try couldn&apos;t have passed the security screening because in his youth he made the mistake of attending an Aryan Nations 
rally, so he&apos; s in their system. We do have someone on the inside at Evergreen and he or she will attempt to let us know which 
vehicle is transporting the target if it tums out we have to make the attempt on his retum journey.&quot; 

Lurch raised his hand. &quot;Uh, lieutenant, I know the airport is going to be infested with ZOG, but if we have that Stinger then I still 
say, why not let me take a crack at noseboy in the air? No need to overcomplicate things. We spot the plane coming in, you put me 
on the back of a pickup with the launcher and then we bust through the fence and onto the field. At a descending altitude I&apos; d only 
need a stop of about five seconds to sight and lock in, maybe a hundred yards short of the mnway, and then I could let fly and 
we&apos; d be on our way. Y ou&apos; d only be risking me and the driver instead of a whole crew. Tank. J eez, I&apos; d love to add a Lear to my 
two choppers!&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 10 



&quot;I&apos;ll drive/&apos; volunteered Spideraian. 

&quot;We&apos; 11 drive/&apos; said Susie Q. &quot;Y ou&apos; 11 need a shooter for covering fire as well&quot; 

&quot;Oh, don&apos; t worry, with any luck you&apos; 11 get your third whirlybird tomorrow/&apos; said Tank with a grin. &quot;No reflection at all on your 
courage, comrades, but in the first place you&apos; d have to cover maybe as much as a half mile of open ground and back, with a clear 
field of fire for the Feds in the terminal or patrolling the airstrip. Y ou could run into anything from land mines to TOW rockets 
and they may even bring in a tank or two from Fort Lewis, plus that helicopter gunship will probably be hovering around in the 
air. Let&apos; s just hope it&apos; s only one. Y our chances would be dicey at best. Secondly, these new Federal VIP jets have all kinds of 
high-tech radar scramblers, heat shells and infrared decoy imaging. This Stinger is Afghan war surplus, still a fine weapon, but it&apos;s 
a much older model and even at short range and low air speed it might get faked out by all the new gadgetry on the Lear and go 
spinning off target or even get distracted by the chopper. It cost us a lot to get hold of it, it&apos; s the last one we&apos; re likely to get for a 
while, and we want to make sure it counts and makes something fall out of the sky. This is a target we can&apos; t afford to miss, boys 
and girls. We want Mr. Rothstein&apos; s briefs turning red, not just brown. So we&apos; re going to have to chomp down on our Burger King 
on the ground.&quot; 

&quot;On the ground where?&quot; I called out 

Tank moved up an overhead projector on wheels, called for the lights to be turned off (the blinds were already drawn on the 
windows, for obvious reasons) and then he switched on the projector and shot an image onto one wall, a street map of Olympia. 
&quot;Paddy? Y ou did the recon on this,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Right,&quot; took up the Irishman, who if I caught the accent right appeared to be from Belfast, &quot;Here&apos; s where it gets a bit dodgey, 
because we&apos; re having to assume some things and second guess the mind of an enemy. The contact in Washington D. C. informs us 
that the Feep in charge is Special Agent Donald R. Shelley, late of the United States Secret Service, so he knows his shite. I 
happen to know that Shelley did a similar quick in-and-out through Olympia Regional Airport this January, escorting the director 
of the National Security Agency who wanted to have a high level meet with the governors of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in 
town here. That one was totally hush-hush on their part, no publicity. We tried an impromptu ambush, and I recognize a couple of 
your faces who were with me on that one, but it was aborted. We missed the bastard both coming and going. But I noticed 
something that I think might be relevant tomorrow. The quickest way to get from the airport to the governor&apos; s mansion where the 
NSA meet was held is obviously this way, hang a left on A irdustrial and out onto Interstate 5 North, get off at Exit 105 and you&apos; re 
there in five minutes. But Shelley&apos; s a good paranoid player, and he doesn&apos; t like the freeway. Understandable, in view of the 
various cowboy exploits the NVA has pulled off on interstates. He likes to take the scenic route through town. More little cross 
streets that he can use to vary his target&apos; s route, more scope to run and hide if he gets ambushed. On an open freeway, once you&apos; re 
boxed in by a determined assault there&apos; s really nowhere to go. On the NSA chief s trip into town we were waiting here in this 
building we&apos; re in now, and we were in place at a couple of other points up and down A irdustrial, but yer man gets real cute and 
the three- limo motorcade just rolls right on down Capitol Boulevard into the city. I had thought of that possibility, but we simply 
didn&apos; t have enough people to lay two adequate ambushes along both routes, nor will we tomorrow. So we went to plan B . W hen 
we got word the convoy was coming back about seven at night, in the dark, we moved into position on the comer of A irdustrial 
and Capitol. If he takes the same way back or if he comes back down 1-5 and gets off at A irdustrial, either way we figure he runs 
into our welcome wagon.&quot; 

&quot;Why didn&apos;t you take up that position when the target landed, sir?&quot; asked Carol, Marlboro dangling from her lips. 
&quot;Too congested in the daytime, too much chance of being observed in daylight and ratted out by some tout with a cell phone who 
wants to pick up some quick cash,&quot; replied Brennan. &quot;There&apos; s a big telemarketing company on the comer here, with hundreds of 
employees going in and out all the time and not enough parking for them, so there were cars parked all up and down the shoulder, 
plus a petrol station on the other comer, here. We would have had to take over the buildings and use them as firing positions, 
which means detaining hundreds of telemarketers and the petrol station staff. Impractical with the numbers we had. All it would 
take would be for one rat with a cell phone to dial 911.&quot; 

&quot;What happened when the NSA guy came back to the airport last January?&quot; asked someone. 

&quot;Because it was a pitch black Northwest winter night we were able to assume some temporary positions near the intersection, 
sitting in the Cascade Teleservices parking lot and parking on the verge in our vehicles along with the telemarketers&apos; motors,&quot; 
Brennan rephed. &quot;We were able to cover all four comers of the intersection. But what does yer man do? He comes back up 
Capitol Boulevard, but while still in town he cuts the motorcade across on Cleveland Boulevard and then down into the Old Y elm 
Highway, here,&quot;— Brennan was using a laser pointer— &quot;And he shdes right up to the airport down Henderson Boulevard, a quick 
left and then a right, and the limos were in under the sheltering guns from the terminal. Any attempt to mount an attack on our part 
at that point, in the dark against an enemy unknown in strength or disposition, would have been pointless and suicidal. Either on a 
map or from scouting out the ground personally, Shelley knew about that back way. I think he&apos; s going to use it again tomorrow 
with Rothstein. Either going in or coming back. He&apos;s not going into downtown Olympia this time, tme, and he&apos;ll have to at least 
cross over the interstate where it branches off into Highway 101 in order to get up to Evergreen College here in the northwest 
comer of our map. But he&apos; 11 be heading in the same general direction, and you can do that by simply reversing the route he used 
before. My guess is that since he used this back way in January on his return trip to avoid us, he&apos;ll get cute again and this time go 
that route into town before he cuts over towards Black Lake.&quot; 
&quot;So we setup along Henderson?&quot; asked Tommy Connors. 

A Distant Thunder 11 



&quot;Aye. Last time we just had RPGs and a 90-millimeter recoilless rifle. This time our opening salute will be high explosive, your 
basic Baghdad banger, a roadside bomb. What can I say? I have a weakness for the classics. We&apos;ve about seventy pounds of 
gelignite and some Semtex, both factory construction- grade, not one of our homemade concoctions made up in the kitchen sink. 
Small enough to be easily rigged and concealed. Assuming they take this back way on either the in- bound or the return trip from 
the airport, we&apos;ve got two fairly good choices for the actual takedown point. First, right here,&quot; (pointer) &quot;At the intersection where 
the Old Y elm Highway runs into Henderson Boulevard. Second, where Henderson Boulevard runs into Old Highway 99 by 
Olympia Regional Airport. The Y elm Highway- Henderson site offers better terrain. It&apos; s a wide open intersection, six lanes on 
Y elm Highway crossing two on Henderson. Very open ground which gives us good visibility and a clear field of fire, but there&apos; s 
enough cover in surrounding buildings to where we can conceal ourselves and our vehicles. A good range of options for E&amp;E 
after the fireworks, and you&apos; d better believe they&apos; 11 be after us like the hounds of hell once we lay hands on this particular A pple 
of God&apos; s Eye, no offense to any Identity folk present. The target&apos; s motorcade will have to slow down in order to make the right 
turn onto Old Y elm going in, or the left turn onto Henderson coming back as may be, and there&apos; s a derelict petrol station right on 
the comer there. We can conceal the HE charge in one of the old petrol pumps, and if we can get the nod and the wink on which 
vehicle Burger King is in we can blow it when he&apos; s within ten to twenty feet, depending on coming or going and therefore what 
lane he&apos;s in. Pack the lot in Teflon pellets, roofing nails and some white phosphorus for luck and that should do it, if we have the 
right vehicle. One good way we&apos;ve found to get around the Bremerizing is to use that particular anchovy combination. The teflon 
and roofing nails can put at least a few puncture wounds in the skin of most armored vehicles at the weak points, window joints, 
door handles, plexiglass that&apos; s been weakened by the explosion or vehicle roll. A blast of sufficient force will actually drive the 
burning phosphorus through those pinpoint punctures and into the interior of the vehicle, thus giving us that kosher barbecue 
effect your company commander so desires.&quot; Laughter. &quot;The rest of us will be waiting with RPG s and our one anti-tank rocket 
and we give Burger King the maddest of Mad Minutes, then we pop the smoke and beat feet out of there. 
&quot;That&apos;s the pros of this position,&quot; Brennan went on gravely. &quot;The cons are that the very features that help us will also help the 
enemy. Those six wide lanes give Burger King&apos; s hmo drivers a lot of dispersal area and turn-around room. Those drivers will be 
trained in their own escape and evasion tactics. Once the Mad Minute starts, the limos that aren&apos;t immediately disabled could be 
scuttling all over the area like cockroaches when you turn on the light in a Puerto Rican kitchen. W e&apos; 11 have our own vehicles at 
hand, obviously, but I don&apos;t want this thing to turn into a Bonnie and Clyde car chase with us trying to run Sammy down. A good 
hit should run on rails and there should be no call for anyone to get creative. This kind of operation should never last more than 
thirty seconds of actual contact time, and then we should all be beating feet We hit, take down the target, then make like an 
amoeba and split. Special A gent Shelley obviously likes a lot of elbow room for his transport. W e shouldn&apos; t give it to him. 
Another problem is that if we have good visibility then so will Rothstein&apos; s escort, and that includes visibility from the helicopter. 
That&apos;s where you come in. Comrade.. ah... &quot; 
&quot;We call him Lurch,&quot; said Thompson. 

&quot;Thank you. Thing. Lurch, while we&apos; re taking down the Burger King I want you to splat that chopper with the Stinger missile 
whenever it gets within such range as you&apos; re sure you can get a hit. Not only a nice spectacular bonus for the six o&apos; clock news, but 
italso means thatafterthe hit when we&apos; re doing our E&amp;E&apos;s we won&apos;thave to worry about the eye in the sky.&quot; 
&quot;I&apos;ve been past that intersection,&quot; said Lurch approvingly. &quot;Good wide horizon. If that copter comes anywhere lower than three 
thousand feet I can have that Stinger up his ass before he knows what hit him.&quot; 

&quot;I don&apos; t doubt it, comrade. He&apos; 11 have to get lower than that to see what&apos; s happening once we pop the top. Just remember, as 
flamboyant as a Blackhawk Down is, our objective is not to shoot down the helicopter, but to liquidate that tyrant in the black robe 
who slaughters helpless children and pisses on our race every time he bangs that bloody gavel. Now, as to the second possible 
take-down point on Henderson.&quot; (Pointer) &quot;This alternative site is a lot more up close and personal, two-lane highway and the 
forest very close in to the shoulder. We&apos;d have them good and boxed in, and we could be hiding behind every tree and firing our 
weapons at almost point-blank range. But by the same token that means more problems for us. For one thing, fewer E&amp;E routes. 
For another, a much narrower field of fire for the Stinger. Mister Lurch would have to wait until the chopper was visible over the 
roadway. The actual hit would be here, about a third of a mile from where Henderson Boulevard runs into Old Highway 99.&quot; 
&quot;Not at the intersection itself?&quot; asked Carol. 

&quot;No,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;That would place the strike within sight and sound of the airport and Rothstein&apos; s security detail there, who 
might come to his aid with more vehicles, maybe even another copter. We&apos;ve got a natural ambush just about here, although it&apos; s 
not shown on the map, but I went over the ground this morning and I discovered that there&apos; s a very sharp turn, almost 90 degrees 
in fact, and traffic has to slow to about 20 mile per hour to negotiate it. The woods are very close in and there are a few houses and 
sheds and whatnot that can provide cover for the shooters, not to mention trees and bushes. Now, we know that place is there. 
Shelley knows it&apos; s there, and I suspect it worries him, but he may figure what worked once will work again, and help him to evade 
anything we may have waiting for him on 1-5. Y ou lads may remember that running battle Number Two Seattle Brigade had with 
the FBI&apos;s SWAT unit on the 1-90 bridge into Bellevue? They&apos;re very paranoid about interstates ever since, and they do not want a 
repetition. If Rothstein&apos; s motorcade takes Henderson Boulevard either coming or going, they&apos; re going to have to slow down to 
about twenty on that elbow. Right at the angle of the curve, there&apos; s a concrete pipe culvert running beneath the road that we can 
stuff full of the gelignite and all kinds of lovely boomables with a remote detonator. Better compression than the gas pump, and 
we can do significant damage to at least two of the limos, bring them to a halt and then use our RPGs and armor- piercing bullets. 
Of the two sites I frankly like this one better. It&apos; s ideal. So ideal in fact that I almost mistrust it as too good to be true.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 12 



&quot;I like to get in close and see their brains/&apos; said Spiderman. Coming from anyone else who looked like him, with his slouch and 
his painted Mohawk, you would have said to yourself Jeez, what kind of snot-nosed arrogant little punk is this? But none of us 
laughed or sneered. We knew Spiderman and Susie, and they really did like to get in close and see the brains. Being sodomized by 
niggers in the King County jail had that effect on a person. And what they&apos;d done to Spiderman was even worse. 
Brennan nodded. &quot;So do I, lad. Well, then, Henderson Boulevard it is. Now as to our dispositions on the morrow... &quot; The 
discussion went on the whole afternoon and I won&apos; t give it verbatim. A fter the C finished his briefing. Smack passed out the 
weaponry. &quot;Y oung Ryan, the CO tells me he likes your style on full auto during a tickle,&quot; said Smack. 
&quot;Can I pack that Thompson again?&quot; I asked. I loved that tommy gun, although all I had done thus far with it was to make some 
Mexicans dance the flamenco in front of a bodega in Centraha (damned recoil got away from me in the awkward position I was 
in, leaning out a car window. ) Plus later on I ventilated an A ssembly of G od minister&apos; s house in C hehalis, in order to make a 
theological point about Jews being God&apos; s Chosen People. I called the minister up afterward and suggested that his sermon the next 
Sunday be on Matthew 27:25. He left town instead. 

&quot;Afraid not,&quot; said Smack, shaking his head. &quot;I lent the Thompson out to some boys who had a special job laid on up in Seattle, 
and it won&apos;t be back for a week or so. Got a goodie for you, though.&quot; He took a weapon out of the back of his van, which was 
pulled inside the hangar, and tossed it to me. Long and lean and lovely it was, with a reet pleat, a stuff cuff, and a drape shape. 
&quot;AK-47?&quot; I asked, turning it, in awe of the sheer beauty and balance of Major Kalashnikov&apos;s famous design of death. The wood of 
the stock was varnished red- gold and polished to gleaming perfection. Without the weight of a magazine it almost seemed to twirl 
in my hand like a pistol. &quot;What make? Not a Valmet, is it?&quot; Valmet was the Finnish knock-off of the Kalashnikov, probably the 
best made and best firing version of many. 

&quot;Nope.&quot; Smack gave a sigh. &quot;Wish I had a Valmet to give you, son. Wish I had Valmets to give all of you beautiful people. This is 
the later model of the 47, an A K-74. Last Soviet military issue before the Iron Curtain went down. This particular piece is a 
souvenir of sunny Iraq. Still got Saddam&apos; s fingerprints on it. To tell the truth, the main reason I want you to tote this tomorrow is 
that I need to use up this 5.45-mm Russki ammo. Y ou used to be able to get 5.45 fairly easy, but the damned Schumer A ct banned 
these beauties and so we&apos; re pretty much having to stick to what we can take off the cops and the Feds. We&apos;ve only got this one 
piece and about two hundred rounds, after which I intend to convert it to .223, which is a hell of a lot more available caliber. Re- 
boring the barrel is no problem and I&apos;m going to amputate the stock and cut the barrel down to right in front of the gas regulator, 
here, so this will be one hell of a close-in chopper. She&apos; 11 tickle Y ehudi&apos; s liver soft and sweet G onna smoothbore it too, to fuck up 
the ballistics so Z G can&apos; t trace it, although the re- chambering is going to be a bit tricky. G oing to have to actually sleeve it up, if 
you follow.&quot; He handed me a round canister drum magazine and two extra banana clips of red plastic, plus a handful of loose 
rounds. &quot;One hundred rounds in that can.&quot; 

&quot;This Soviet issue as well?&quot; I asked, looking over the drum curiously. 

&quot;Nope. Home manufactured in our own machine shop, young Ryan,&quot; he said proudly. &quot;Gonna be too heavy for you?&quot; 
&quot;I&apos;m not a girl,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Watch it, dude!&quot; said Susie Q. &quot;He means you&apos;re a shrimp.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry, Suze. I&apos; m a shrimp, but I can handle it. Smack, although yeah, the drum does seem to throw it a bit off balance,&quot; I added 
as I slapped the canister into the magazine well. I picked up the weapon and hefted it, aimed it. With the drum mag it was indeed 
heavy, but I was young and wiry and could manage it. &quot;I&apos;ve fired the M-16 and the BAR, and the Thompson, of course,&quot; I told 
Smack. &quot;The BAR and Tommy gun are heavier than this piece with full magazines. This bolt seems loose.&quot; 
&quot;AKs are deliberately engineered hke that, with a little bit of play to allow for heat expansion and crud and to avoid jams,&quot; 
explained Smack. &quot;That&apos; s what makes them such fine weapons. Y ou can stick an A K at the bottom of a swamp for a week, pull it 
out, blow out the bolt assembly and it will still fire. Y ou was never in the army?&quot; 
&quot;Nope, evil racist as I was. 4F on grounds of moral fiber, lack thereof.&quot; 

&quot;But you know full auto fire control procedures, right? This is a joy to use, son, and it can do a lot of damage, but it&apos; s not to play 
Rambo with.&quot; 

&quot;Y eah, I know,&quot; I told him. &quot;Carter and Adam Wingfield both taught me. Fire short bursts and try for a good tight shot group. Y ou 
say to yourself /ire-(3-burst-o/-S!x as you pull the trigger and that actually gives you a burst of five rounds.&quot; 
&quot;Tank, any way we can let Shane and some of these others test fire their weapons before showtime?&quot; called Smack. &quot;If s just not 
good work habits letting people go into combat with a piece they&apos;ve never even shot. Especially on a tickle this important.&quot; 
Tank agreed and so much of the rest of the evening was taken up with a trip to a private home on a back road outside Y elm where 
a long enclosed cellar contained an impromptu, soundproofed firing range. It was helpful but also make- work, since Tank was an 
experienced combat officer and believed in keeping his troops busy. We put on ear protectors and I fired a banana clip out of the 
AK-74, five shots semi and the rest in automatic bursts. The AK had virtually no recoil; I could have played tic-tac-toe with it. 
Susie Q. cut loose with a full drum of double-ought buck from the South A frican Stryker shotgun she would be packing, 
Spiderman put a magazine through the Uzi he&apos;d drawn. Tommy Connors popped a few mags through an M-16 he&apos;d been given, 
and Lurch ran over the firing procedure for our one LA W S rocket with Spiderman, although we couldn&apos; t fire it for obvious 
reasons. 

W hen we&apos; d cleaned the weapons Tommy and I went back to the old swimming hole while the rest of them went to undisclosed 
locations where they would rack in for the night before rendezvous at 0900 next morning. A nother rule we learned the hard way 
was never have your entire Volunteer force in one place for any longer than was necessary. Always move and camp in 

A Distant Thunder 13 



detachments. I was assigned a cot in one of the offices and given my guard duty shift me and Smack on ten to two and then 
Tommy and Carol would relieve us. Before racking in I managed to have a word with Tank, a number of words actually, and he 
probably wondered if I was stoned or something until he finally figured out what I was hinting at. Y ou never asked questions 
about the status or whereabouts of other V olunteers even within your own unit Such curiosity made others curious about you. But 
there was someone special I hadn&apos; t seen around for a while. My wife. 

&quot;Rooney&apos; s the one on the inside at Evergreen with this one, Shane,&quot; he bDld me. That s what I had been afraid of. Y ou wouldn&apos;t 
have thought someone as striking- looking as Rooney would be a good spy, but since to be honest she was striking in a gooney- 
looking way instead of a supermodel- looking way, no one ever looked twice at her. I mean, everybody knows from James Bond 
movies that female spies are all stunning beauties, right? Normally the CO wouldn&apos;t have bDld me what she was doing, but he 
knew about me and Rooney. &quot;She&apos; s not strapped, so you don&apos;t have to worry about her getting caught be a metal detector or 
anything like that A 11 she&apos; s got is a cell phone. She&apos; 11 be doing her V alley G irl act M ay be she&apos; 11 even ask for Sammy&apos; s autograph 
if she can get close enough, and tell him all about how she wants bD go to law school and become legally blonde. Y ou&apos; ve heard her 
do her act During the course of the afternoon she&apos; s going to make a couple of calls to an equally brainless Valley Girl, and if any 
Zoggies are eavesdropping they will swear they&apos;re hstening to Jennifer and Brittany from Encino. We have a pretty 
comprehensive code set up for them and she can tell us anything we need to know. She will tip us as to when they leave, and if she 
possibly can she&apos;ll let us know what hmo Burger King is riding in. She&apos;s a soldier, son, and a damned fine one.&quot; 
&quot;I know that boss,&quot; I said with a scowl. &quot;I have to accept that but I don&apos;t have to like it&quot; 

&quot;Yes you do, and no you don&apos;t&quot; said the CO with a slap on my shoulder. &quot;By the way, she was worried aboutyou too. I bDld her 
you were a total stumblebum who couldn&apos;t be trusted with a piece without shooting himself in the foot but for her sake we&apos; d look 
out for you.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you from both of us,&quot; I told him.

In revolutionary movies they show a tickle like this going down with the NVA actors all dressed up in full tiger-stripe camouflage 
fatigues, black turtle- necks and ski masks, maybe a few wearing the old Party fedora for picturesque effect hiding in complex 
dugouts in the woods, calling one another by rank and saluting one another in both military and National Socialist style, rappeling 
out of trees and down skyscrapers and all kinds of malarkey like that Okay, there were one or two operations during the war that 
probably went like that hke the attack on the aircraft carrierjohn F. Kennedy in Bremerton, but none that I ever went on. Most of 
my tickles never had more than four or five guys tops, two in one car and three in another because you always took two vehicles. 
If the NVA had sashayed around town wearing ninja outfits, I kind of think people would have noticed. We made it a point to 
dress like typical American slobs. 

The morning we went after Hizzoner Sammy Rothstein I was wearing cutoff jeans, negroid running shoes, a puke-green beer 
advertisement T-shirt showing a drunken dancing frog, and a blue Seattle Mariners baseball cap, with my extra magazines for the 
AK-74 stuck out of sight in the Jeep Cherokee Johnny Pill and I had been assigned. Volunteers dressed down so that when we E&amp;E&apos; ed afterwards we could blend in with the equally ragbag populace. What we did do a lot of times was carry two shirts on a 
tickle, usually T-shirts, or two jackets in the winter, so if witnesses saw two men in army camo jackets at the scene, then ten 
minutes later on a street two miles away one man wearing a cardigan and a second guy across town wearing a leather bomber 
jacket would attract less attention. We also would usually wear a hat into action in order to break our profile, sometimes the old 
Party fedora which was the only uniform or badge the Northwest movement ever had prior to Longview, and sometimes a cowboy 
hat or a pea cap. Then we&apos; d switeh to typical Amurrican El Dorko baseball caps once we broke contact All white boys in baseball 
caps looked pretty much alike to FATPO. For the Rothstein gig I had a rolled up plain white sweatshirt and I was planning to lose 
the baseball cap after we beat feet 

Carol, Brennan, Tank Thompson and the Bear had planted the explosive charges in the culvert in the pre- dawn hours, with the 
remote control debDnabDr going to Carol. She apparently had a real case of the ass for abortionists, this being the reason she had 
invited herself along on this particular operation. Because the charges were below ground they hadn&apos;t bothered with exotica like 
Teflon pellets or phosphorus, but in addition to the seventy pounds of jelly they&apos;d tossed in about ten of Semtex and a few sticks 
of TNT just for shits and giggles. There was going to be one hell of a hole in that road, and we all had to stay at least a hundred 
yards away on either side and well covered so we didn&apos;t get caught in the blast We didn&apos;t dig dugouts or climb up in trees and 
make turkey blinds or any cute mess like that Once a Mad Minute (which was usually about twenty seconds, by the way) was up 
and your team leads popped the smoke grenades you ran, not walked, to your transport and you floored it out of there. 
Earlier that morning. Tank had taken each team out from the warehouse on A irdustrial Drive. Using a different one of our vehicles 
each time, he cruised nonchalantly past the edge of the airport where we could see enemy movement and glinting metal behind the 
Bremerwallsunderthe huge red, white and blue Masonic dishrag. The CO showed each of us where we would be stationed. All 
of us were positioned with our wheels, out of sight in the woods or otherwise off road along Henderson Boulevard for about three 
hundred yards on either side of the ninety-degree elbow in the highway, two or three Volunteers per vehicle. Our communications 
would be a conference call on cell phones, one man per team being issued a disposable phone and headset W e didn&apos; t want to use 
our own phones because ZOG could track various electronic tags in a signal through the cell site, and not only locate the caller but 
figure out the phone number on a wireless. Henderson Boulevard ran through a sparsely populated area on the edge of town, and 
within our fire zone there were only a couple of private homes with driveways, a ragged- looking little apartment complex that 
appeared to be about half vacant and a small auto body shop consisting of a junkyard and a couple of corrugated iron sheds. The 

A Distant Thunder 14 



apartment complex would probably get some windows broken by the bomb&apos; s concussion, but they were in a small hollow below 
highway level, and unless someone was actually pulling out of the driveway onto Henderson Boulevard at the time there shouldn&apos; t 
be any injuries. The body shop was on the edge of the blast area and would probably get some shrapnel through the walls. &quot;I&apos;ve 
got their phone number and once we know that the target convoy is on Henderson and we&apos; re D minus about forty seconds I&apos; 11 give 
those guys a call on my other wireless phone and tell them to get out from under any cars they&apos; re under and hit the floor/&apos; said 
Tank. &quot;That&apos;s all we can do for them.&quot; 

At the final briefing Tank told us, &quot;If Special Agent Shelley takes our Burger King out of the airport and into town down 
Henderson Boulevard and right into our trap, well and good. We&apos; re looking at three or possibly four Bremerized limousines. If it&apos; s 
three, we blow the middle vehicle when it&apos; s rounding the curve and right on top of the culvert, and there will be enough blast to 
take out or at least slow down the other two. If it&apos; s four limos then we blow the second one to cross over the culvert. If Rothstein 
happens to be in the car that&apos; s passing over the charge as it detonates, he and everybody in that limo is toast, no worries. But the 
whole purpose of having all those cars is to conceal the precise whereabouts of Hizzoner from us evildoers, and he might be in 
one of the others. That&apos; s why after the opening bang we all close in and do the old Shock and Awe trick on any limos or moving 
pieces of limos that try to get by us. We&apos; re lucky here in that the right- angle curve of the road will prevent any of our teams from 
firing into the other. &quot;Ted and myself, Carol and Paddy and Ray will be in the center spot, back behind that derelict bam I showed 
you. When we close, Ted will hose down the fire zone with the M-60. Since they are our guests, Paddy will have the loan of our 
BAR loaded with our home-made Teflon slugs, and Carol gets my own Mike Sixteen, also with Teflon rounds. I&apos; 11 give a coup de 
grace where needed with an RPG . Our team will E&amp;E in the Explorer and the Toyota pickup. Spidey and Susie will come up 
from the south with the Ford pickup, de-bus and take out any enemy vehicle still intact with the LAWS rocket, while Comrade 
Lurch will be in the back with the Stinger and with any luck take down the chopper when it swoops in to try and cover what&apos; s left 
of the motorcade. Tommy and Mack the Knife will be down behind the apartments in the Camry and they&apos;ll turn south on 
Henderson, link with the heavy weapons team and back them up with one RPG as well. Every team has a rocket grenade except 
for Shane and John. Sorry, guys, I know that leaves you a bit light, but with any luck none of the limos will even get up to your 
position. Y ou guys move down the road with the Cherokee and stand by to recover any of our people who for whatever reason 
loses his transportation and needs a ride. If that happens, the rest of you, head north and John and Shane will pick you up on the 
fly. Smack will be cruising the area around the airport and letting me know what&apos; s going on, when the Lear jet lands, and most 
importantly, what route they&apos; re taking into town. He will also be available for any extraction of stranded personnel. Keep low and 
take it easy, J ack, because once he&apos; s down they&apos; 11 be watching all over for us as well. Bones has set up an aid station in Y elm, 
where you guys were test firing your weapons last night. Any wounded need to try and make it there. Otherwise, rendezvous at the 
Dew Drop Inn within two hours after contact.&quot; The Dew Drop Inn was a bam on a dairy farm outside Bucoda. 
&quot;All this, of course, is if Burger King goes into town down Henderson Boulevard,&quot; took up Brennan. &quot;If he goes down Capitol 
Boulevard or out onto the interstate to get to Evergreen College, then we do a stand- down. It&apos; s not a good idea for us to be 
hanging around twiddling our thumbs in those positions for seven or eight hours until he decides to cmise on back to the airport. 
Somebody will spot us loitering about, sniff reward money and phone the Domestic Terrorism Hotline. Plus we have to assume 
there will be Feds and cops of various kinds patrolling the area that close to the airfield. Y ou all know your stand- down 
positions?&quot; We did. If Rothstein missed his A. M. appointment with destiny, Johnny and I got to spend the day in the Tumwater 
public library and then at a high school tennis match until we got the call telling us to re-deploy. Or else to forget the whole thing 
and get back to Dundee, because something had gone wrong somewhere. That happened entirely too often for my taste. 
Before we went out. Tank called us all together for a prayer. Tank wasn&apos;t a Christian but some of us were, and out of respect for 
those comrades and also out of a sensible desire to hedge our bets with the Man Upstairs just in case, we all bowed our heads over 
our weapons. Tank&apos;s prayer was always the same. &quot;Lord,&quot; he intoned, &quot;You know how busy we&apos;re all going to be today. If at 
times we forgetThee, Lord, don&apos;tyou forget us.&quot; 

Burger King was scheduled to hit dirt at eleven. We pulled into place about ten fifty- five, each team taking a slightly different 
route into the operational area. Johnny Pill and I had drawn the northemmost outpost, about a quarter mile up from what was soon 
to become Dead Man&apos;s Curve, on the eastem side of the road, back in the woods down a firebreak. Johnny Pill drove the 
Cherokee and I was on the conference call with the headset mike stuck in my ear. Johnny&apos;s Uzi was on the seat beside us and I 
had the stock of the A K- 74 folded, the weapon on my lap. So we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. At four 
minutes past eleven I heard Smackwater Jack&apos; s voice, &quot;The turkey has landed,&quot; so we knew that the Lear jet was on the ground 
andso was Burger King. We were under strict orders to keep non-essential chatter to a minimum, so we didn&apos; t get anything like 
regular progress reports, but we should have been informed once the convoy left Olympia Regional Airport, if they were headed 
in our direction. 

Unfortunately, this time Feep threw us another curve. The Olympia Regional Airport is small by airport standards but still pretty 
damned big, and there&apos;s a lot of ways in and out Smack didn&apos;t pick them up until they were already heading down the road. In the 
wrong direction. &quot;Marie and the girls can&apos;t make it for lunch, looks like,&quot; said Smack casually. 

&quot;Marie,&quot; I toldjohnny. That was the code word that told us what was going on. &quot;That means they&apos;re heading down Airdustrial to 
the interstate.&quot; 
&quot;Shit,&quot; said John. 

A Distant Thunder 15 



We waitsd for a while in case they got cute and pulled a double- back, but we heard nothing from Smack. &quot;Okay, boys and girls/&apos; 
came Tank&apos;s voice at about quarter to twelve. &quot;Looks like our lunch date is off. Marie and the girls are stuck in traffic, but 
hopefully we can still get together with the ladies for dinner at Burger King. See you guys then.&quot; 

&quot;That&apos;s it/&apos; I said to Pilafski in disgust. &quot;We stand down until we get the call and hope he comes back this way tonight/&apos; I said. 
&quot;Plus I get to catch up on my reading. I never did finish Bleak House and I&apos;m dying to know howjamdyceversusjamdyce 
ended.&quot; 

&quot; Y ou&apos; re weird, kid,&quot; said Johnny. We were just pulling out onto Henderson Boulevard to go improve our minds when I looked to 
my right, and all of a sudden two motorcycle cops swept around the bend. They were followed by one, two, three black stretch 
limos with dark green tinted windows, identical as peas in a pod, little A murrican flags fluttering on their front fenders. Two more 
bike cops brought up the rear. Smack hadn&apos; t mentioned anything to us about a motorcycle escort They must have met the limos 
en route. Overhead we heard the rumble of a low-flying helicopter. Our target was right on top of us, at the moment we were 
breaking up the ambush, coming from the wrong direction where no one expected them, and now the two cops in the lead were 
turning their heads slightly and staring right at two Northwest Volunteers who had come there to kill them and were caught totally 
unprepared. Oh, yeah. I grinned at the cops and waved, the motorcade swept on by, and I shouted a warning into the headset&apos;s 
little stick mike in front of my face. I didn&apos; t bother with code talk, but out of ingrained habit at least I didn&apos; t shout out anybody&apos; s 
name in the clear. &quot;Boss! Get them back!&quot; I yelled. &quot; Here they come! Burger King is headed your way southbound, repeat, 
southbound! You got maybe ten seconds! He&apos;s coming, God damn it!&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; said a male voice in surprise. &quot;They&apos; re coming from town? How the hell did that happen?&quot; 

&quot;I see him, and our lady friend has the remote in hand,&quot; came Tank&apos;s voice in my ear, calm and steady. &quot;Okay, Volunteers, it&apos;s 
showtime after all. Let s go waltzing Matilda.&quot; 

W e later found out that through nothing more or less than sheer, unadulterated coincidence, about the same time Rothstein&apos; s 
motorcade was sliding onto 1-5 northbound at the Exit 101 on- ramp, a few miles north around the Pacific Avenue exit there were 
some completely unrelated fireworks. Interstate Five was the main drug route between Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and 
Vancouver for the multifarious Third World narcotics gangs and cartels fromL. A., all of whom knew and despised one another. 
Two Cadillac loads of dopers, one being monkoids from the Mau Mau Nation and the second cholos from the Mexican Mafia, 
were both headed back to South Central from separate pharmaceutical runs to Seattle. They recognized one another just as they 
rolled past Tacoma and played grab- ass for about twenty miles, flipping each other the bird and trying to run each other off the 
highway, so forth and so on. Then at exit 106 they said to hell with playing bumper cars, pulled over to the shoulder and started 
blasting away at one another with their Uzis and 9- mils and whatever else they had. But they forgot where they were. In Los 
A ngeles, commuters had long ago come to take such scuffles in stride as just another traffic hazard and the police were no longer 
even a factor, but the Northwest was full of dangerous white boys with guns and that was a whole different matter as far as law 
enforcement was concerned. The Olympia cops and the FBI were already jittery about the Rothstein visit. They got garbled word 
there were bullets flying at the Pacific Avenue exit everyone automatically assumed it was an NVA tickle of some kind, and all 
maimer of ZOG descended in full force on that stretch of interstate and started blazing away at the startled gang- bangers. Special 
Agent in Charge Don Shelley was alerted to a possible DT contact— that&apos; s ZOG speak for domestic terrorist— and rather than risk 
running into some kind of unknown NVA -related sitch with his precious Hebraic cargo, he decided to abort The airport was 
closer than Evergreen College and so the ever-cautious Shelley turned back. He ordered his convoy to get off at Exit 103, cut over 
onto Cleveland Boulevard and back down Old Y elm and Henderson, thus sliding headlong into our bona fide Volunteer ambush. 
I always called it the luck of the Irish. Rooney used to call it the hand of God. Whatever it was. Somebody somewhere out there in 
the cosmos was sure as hell giving us a hand, because this kind of amazing coincidence happened a lot down through the years. It 
was like all of a sudden after almost a century, as a reward for our finally showing some hair on our ass, the white man&apos; s bad run 
of the cards was over and the goddess Fortuna smiled on all us little Sullas once again. Luck often enough will save a man, if his 
courage hold. And save a people. 

Once the Federal motorcade passed us, there was silence for a few seconds. Johnny spoke from behind the wheel. &quot;I&apos;ll roll us on 
down there as soon as we hear. . . &quot; The ground shook beneath our feet, and we weren&apos; t even standing on the ground. It was that 
powerful. We didn&apos;t hear an explosion as such; it was almost like the earth groaned. We felt the blast jigger through our bodies 
like we were jelly, and then we got hit with a shock wave that rattled the trees around us like a sudden gale. I looked to my left 
and saw something in the sky. At first I thought it was the helicopter, but then I saw it was a long black stretch limousine, twirling 
lazily a hundred feet in the air. It sailed over the trees and out of sight. &quot;They&apos; re playing our song! &quot; I yelled at J ohnny, opening the 
door and standing up, leaning my weapon over the roof and bracing myself with my left hand. &quot;Let&apos;s rumble!&quot; Johnny peeled out 
of the firebreak just as one of the black armored limos came hurtling around the bend at about seventy miles an hour. That Fed 
driver had gotten the message, loud and clear. Once he got past us, he was outta there. 

Johnny saw that too. &quot;Jump!&quot; he yelled. I jumped and rolled and came up with the AK at the ready. Johnny peeled out of the 
firebreak and rammed the limo full in the side, caroming off the armor plating and sending the Cherokee spinning, its front end 
smashed in. The limo swerved and leaped off the road, jumped the small ditch on the west side of the highway and slammed into a 
large Douglas fir, still in the air. The doors of the limo opened and four men staggered out. Three wore the usual Feep quasi- 
uniform of dark suits, patent leather shoes, black trenchcoats and shades. One Federal had a Heckler-Koch submachine gun which 
he waved groggily at tlie Cherokee, firing a wild burst I muttered to myself fire-a-burst-of-six and the Fed dropped down behind 
the open rear door. I thought I&apos;d got him, but from behind the door he fired the Heckler again at the Cherokee, which was sitting 

A Distant Thunder 16 



smoking and wrecked in the middle of the highway. I&apos; m not sure the Zionist gunman had even figured out I was around yet. The 
driver saw me, though. He raised his Clock pistol and I raised my A K to my shoulder. We fired at the same time. He missed. I 
didn&apos;t. I saw his head pop. I looked over and saw Johnny out of the Cherokee, his head bloody from the impact of the crash, 
spraying his Uzi at the Fed behind the car door who was spraying at him. 

The other two started stumbling away from the vehicle. One was a huge black man in a black trenchcoat with a shaven head and 
one of these Lion of Judah goatees, trying to shoot at me with a Clock with one hand and with the other trying to drag a roly poly 
figure in a gray silk suit away, leading him by the hand like one leads a child. Finally something clicked in my adrenalin- pumped 
and noise- rattled and cordite- smoked mind. The short fat dude in the gray silk was one Samuel L. Rothstein, Supreme Justice of 
the United States Supreme Court. Bingo. Burger King. Johnny saw him, pointed, and yelled at me &quot;Get him!&quot; I snapped off a 
burst at the pair of them but they were into the woods. I ran across the road and jumped the ditch and all of a sudden there I was in 
the great Northwest forest. Fifteen feet in from the highway and it was damned near primeval, Douglas firs and ferns and lovely 
spring sunshine spilling down in columns from the sky. I wouldn&apos;t have been surprised to see Sasquatch peeping out from behind 
a tree trunk. And no sign at all of Big Jew and his Affikin-Amurkin minder. Oh, Christ, no, don&apos;t tell me I lost a damned Supreme 
Court Justice! I cursed to myself in rage and despair. In a second it all flashed before me. How many of my friends had died just 
down the road or would die in the next minute, and me lose the son of a bitch? Then I heard something in the underbrush snap 
ahead of me and to my right Suddenly, instinctively, I understood. 

The black was in charge, and he feared the northern forest. He didn&apos; t understand it. If he&apos; d just had sense enough to run and hide 
in the woods until help came, then he and Rothstein might both have made it. Hell, I wasn&apos;t Daniel Boone. What was I going to 
do? Track them by their scent? But in moments of stress, racial and genetic instinct always comes to the fore. This wasn&apos; t A frica. 
This was the ancient landscape of my people, not his. Homey knew in his soul he was in de white folks&apos; house, and it 
overwhelmed him. The black man dared not face an Aryan warrior in the green forest of the Northland from which I and all of 
mine had sprung. It was in his very blood to avoid that. Instinctively, probably not even realizing what he was doing or 
understanding why, he was heading back to what he knew. Asphalt and concrete. He was dragging his Chosen charge back to the 
highway to try and get another car. 

I moved low and fast about thirty yards through the bush, parallel to the roadway, and I heard an engine and braking tires. The 
black Feep and Rothstein were shouting and trying between them to drag a young white couple out of their green Kia. The couple 
thought they were being carjacked, which they were, in a sense. The young guy took a few ineffectual punches at the bodyguard, 
who cold-cocked him with a single blow from the barrel of the Clock. The white kid dropped hke a sack of potatoes. The white 
girl was screaming and crying and trying to mace the nigger with some pepper spray she had on a key chain. He tore the mace 
away from her. I heard the bones in her hand crack over her shrieks. Then she looked over and saw me. &quot;Get down!&quot; I roared at 
her. &quot;NVA! Hit the dirt!&quot; She understood NVA, and even twenty feet away I saw her go as white as a sheet in pure terror. She 
copped to what was happening and she dove for the tarmac, covering the body of her husband or boyfriend with her own. The 
black saw me as well and snapped up his Clock fast as hghting. I heard the bullet tweet past my ear. Fire-a-burst-of-six. He 
staggered and turned and twirled down onto the road. I saw his white shirtfront soaked in red. The fool wasn&apos; t wearing his kevlar 
and he paid for it with his life. 

Rothstein was scuttling away down the road, his bandy legs pumping, his sticklike arms sprouting out of his plump body, waving 
like windmills. I charged after him. When I got clear of the Kia I popped a couple of rounds at his feet, and he stopped. &quot;A million 
dollars!&quot; I heard him shriek. &quot;A million! I swear, a million dollars III pay!&quot; I walked up behind him. I guess by then I was half 
insane. I could only remember something from my high school drama class, one of the few parts of school I&apos;d enjoyed. I spoke. 
Well, I kind of croaked. Or maybe shouted. I don&apos;t know. They were the only words I could think of to say. 
&quot;Turn, hell-hound!&quot; 

Samuel L. Rothstein understood, and he turned with a gasp of horror. I saw the round face, the white rolling eyes, the frizzy fringe 
of hair, the obscene revolting nose. I saw that godawful face and nose raise up to the sky. From the thick, veal- colored lips came 
a— I guess you&apos; d call it a howl, but it wasn&apos; t really. It was like a loud evil bleat, the sound of a dead soul vomiting. Seventy years 
ago this happened, and I can&apos; t get that terrible scream out of my ears. Never mind. I can&apos; t describe it and even if I could I don&apos; t 
understand whatever the hell it was, so I couldn&apos; t make you understand. They&apos; re not like us, and there&apos; s no A ryan equivalent. It 
was just— it was horrible. That creature was standing in the middle of Henderson Boulevard and it bellowed its death cry unto its 
god, to whatever force of cosmic power put the Jewish people on earth to torture and oppress the rest of us. In his last moments of 
life Samuel Rothstein experienced an epiphany. A revelation of cosmic proportions, one that came far too late to be of any use at 
all to him. Samuel L. Rothstein suddenly understood that his god had betrayed him. A revelation of eternal truth shattered his soul 
moments before the bullets from my K alashnikov shattered his body, that revelation being that the Jewish people ain&apos; t anywhere 
near as goddamned clever as they think they are. 

I took a strong, balanced stance, legs at shoulder width, ninety degree angle to the target. Rifle to shoulder, good sight picture, 
even at point blank range aim a wee bit low to compensate for the shght recoil. Fire-a-burst-of-six. Rothstein could eat now, 
because by Cod he was dancing like Fred Astaire. Fire-a-burst-of-six and Big Jew he shimmy and he shake like a bowl full of 
jelly. Then he&apos; s down on the asphalt, his stick- like legs and arms waving in the air like a cockroach who just got hit with the Black 
Flag, which I suppose isn&apos; t a bad way to describe this whole gig. He&apos; s down and wallowing in his own blood and piss and shit I 
heard Tank Thompson&apos;s voice, faraway. &quot;Shane, you got him! We&apos;re done here! Let&apos;s beat feet!&quot; Dead babies. Babies! What 

A Distant Thunder 17 



kind of monster that calls itself a man kills babies? I walked up to the quivering thing on the highway and put the barrel of my 

weapon to its head. Fire-a-burst-of-six. 

&quot;Shane, God damn it!&quot; somebody yelled. &quot;They&apos;re coming after us from the airport! Let&apos;s go.&apos;&quot; 

I remembered something else from that one play in drama class. I looked down at the corpse. &quot;Who would have thought the old 

man had so much blood in him?&quot; I remarked conversationally, to no one in particular. Then we beat feet. 

Oh, yeah. Lurch got copter number three that day. J ohnny told me later a piece of the rotor blade crashed into Henderson 

Boulevard about eight feet from me and damned near took off my head. I didn&apos;t notice.

-Hamlet, Act III, Scene One 
Good morning, ma&apos;am. If you&apos; re ready to record I&apos;m ready to ramble. 

I suppose it&apos; s best to start at the beginning. I&apos; 11 go ahead and get the family and childhood stuff out of the way, so I can get on with 
the real story. My full name is Shane Alan Ryan. I was bom in Providence Hospital in Dundee, Washington, ninety-one years ago 
last month. I&apos;ve lived in Dundee most of my life except for my tour of military duty during the War of Independence with the 
Northwest Volunteer Army, and again when I was called up to the Northwest Defense Force during Operation Strikeout, when I 
got as far north as Chilliwack in B. C. and as far south as Chico in California. We had to pull back from Chico after the armistice. 
Never particularly wanted to live anywhere else than Dundee. Grow where you&apos; re planted, I always figured. Oh, yeah, I been to 
Spokane and Coeur d&apos; Alene and Jackson Hole, Wyoming since then, but that was on vacation. 

Married twice, widowed twice, no children from the first marriage to my lifelong regret, eight from the second and something on 
the orderof twenty- four grandchildren, number twenty- five coming along next week sometime, and six great- grandkids, including 
that little three year-old imp of Satan who is about to pull the tripod out from under your camera, and whom you have my 
permission to smack. I been retired for more years than I care to remember. I&apos;ve worked at the methane power plant out on Clark 
Highway, and I also ran a vacuum sealer at the cannery down on the harbor. Worked for the Party as well. For some years I was 
chief immigrant housing officer for the Bureau of Race and Resettlement I always had a partiality for German Homecomers, and 
my efforts are one reason why you can buy the Lewischer Zeitung from a rack right beside the Dundee Advertiser. After I retired 
from the Bureau, just for something to do, my last job was as a night watchman at a Ministry of Agriculture cranberry processing 
plant. I have three pensions, one from the Veteran&apos;s Fund and one from the cannery, plus my usual government Codger Credit. 
When I croak, which should be sometime fairly soon, the Sons and Daughters of the NVA will bury me for free beside both of my 
late wives and give me a nice marble headstone with the Volunteer seal and the little statue of the guy in the fedora hat holding the 
Kalashnikov on top, which in my case is accurate because I did tote an AK on a few occasions. Once a year on October twenty- 
second, the local school children will come and pull up the weeds and replace the little vinyl Tricolor on my grave before their 
class goes off and eat themselves sick at their Independence Day party, so I&apos; m pretty much taken care of. Not a bad way to end up 
at my age, I&apos; 11 give the revolution that. Damned sight better shape than I would have been in if we&apos; d stayed with ZOG . 
My birth in Providence Hospital was notable in being the last major medical expense my family ever had that was covered by 
health insurance. Lucky for us, I was the youngest of three children. Two months after I was bom, my father was downsized from 
the last living-wage job with full benefits he would ever hold. From then on he worked at a series of temporary jobs with no 
bennies until each job in tum was lost to India or China or Guatemala when they found some mud who could do it for fifty cents a 
day. My father was an architect and a dmnk, then he became an architectural draftsman and a dmnk, then he was a consultant and 
a dmnk, then a warehouse freight checker and a dmnk, and finally he was just a dmnk. We went from a split-level ranch on 
Country Club Drive when I was a baby, to a roomy but mn-down two-story 1920s fixer-upper we lived in until I was ten, then a 
four- room renter house, then a series of smaller and smaller apartments and by the time that, to everyone&apos; s surprise, I made it to 
high school graduation we were in a twenty year-old mobile home out on Dead Dog Road. 

My mom was a secretary, then a bookkeeper, and finally she ended up working behind the counter in a laundromat mn by a 
Pakistani. She was a bad dmnk too, but she always held her liquor a lot better than Dad and usually you couldn&apos; t tell when she 
was sloshed except by how mean and hateful she talked, about everyone and everything. Dad alternately raged at the world and 
wallowed in self-pity, but he never did anything about it. Didn&apos;t even get in fights. I always had the impression that at some point 
in time he&apos; d just given up on it all in sheer bafflement. He once told me when he was really plastered that life is an endless ordeal 
of meaningless suffering, and the only advice he could offer me was to save string, which might have been pretty profound if I 
hadn&apos; t leamed later on that he&apos; d gotten that line from a W oody A Hen movie. Mom on the other hand would do things, evil nasty 
things, like spiking her office rivals&apos; coffee with a little plastic pack of shampoo, sending people anonymous letters and e-mails 
telling them their spouse was cheating, that kind of petty malicious crap. In later years she took to calling govemment snitch lines 
anonymously to accuse people she didn&apos;t like of being dmg dealers, child abusers, and later on of being with the NVA, whether it

was true or not. During the war I was always scared Mom would really ID one of our people by accident and rat them out, and 
then r d be the one sent to whack her. I didn&apos; t particularly like her, but it would have been very disrespectful. 
One day the FBI rocked up at the trailer and enlightened her that I wasn&apos;t traveling the Northwest as a Secret Shopper for Mighty 
Mart, and that I was really a Volunteer. I like to think that she never turned me in because I was family, but I have to admit I 
always suspected it was because she knew what would happen if she did. Death would have seriously interfered with her drinking. 
But after that, on my brief and infrequent covert visits home Mom kept nagging me to shoot the neighbors, or her co-workers, or 
whoever was on her hate list at the time. So I had to stop coming around, because I&apos; d say no and she&apos; d start whimpering about 
how I didn&apos;t love her, trying to make me feel guilty because I wouldn&apos;t be her private angel of death avenging all her petty hatreds 
and disappointments in life. Eventually another NVA crew from Centralia caught up with the Paki owner of the laundromat where 
she worked. The boys thumped him gentle and artistic with baseball bats, an axe handle, and a piece of steel rebar. After the wog 
got out of the hospital he decided the grass was greener in Los Angeles, so Mom lost her job and she quit speaking to me, which I 
was frankly glad of. After the revolution I had a word with a comrade I knew on the Lewis County enemy property expropriations 
committee, and he gave the laundromat to Mom. She hired some new migrants from Switzerland to run it for her, it made her the 
boss and kept her in booze until she died of cancer, and so from that point on I was just the best and most loving son in the world, 
a heroic fighter for our people&apos; s freedom, blah blah blah ishkabibble. That kind of relationship. Y ou&apos; 11 know what I mean if 
you&apos;ve ever had to deal with an alcoholic in the family. 

D ad was euthanized a few months after I went on the bounce. I don&apos; t think it had anything to do with me being NV A . I hope not, 
anyway. He had been admitted to the hospital for liver failure due to severe cirrhosis. He had no medical insurance, and needless 
to say he couldn&apos; t afford a liver transplant Medicare was long gone and Medicaid had finally folded up completely a year before, 
so Dad was certified as terminal by ajew doctor named Friedman, and one morning my Mom got a call at work saying Dad had 
been given a lethal injection of sodium pentathol the night before under Article So and So, Section Ishkabibble of the Senior 
Citizens&apos; Quality of Life Act, which I always thought was a strange name for a law that gave doctors the right to kill old people 
who annoyed them or who had no money. Basically, the United States government realized that unless something was done there 
would be millions of elderly white people from the Baby Boom who had no money and no insurance and who constituted a 
potential drain on the economy that might wreck the whole apple cart. So rather than stop pouring money down the Middle East 
rathole in a futile attempt to make the Arabs love Israel at gunpoint while we stole their oil, the government of the United States 
solved the problem from the other end by cutting expenses, i.e. by simply killing off the sick and the old people. 
It wasn&apos; t hard to do, since the precedent had already been set with massive legal abortion. There was a certain hideous logic to it. 
If you can kill a baby, then why not an octogenarian? What&apos; s the difference if the human life being snuffed out for reasons of 
general inconvenience is minus three months or plus eighty- four years? By Amurrica&apos;s warped logic, there was none. The 
precedent was set with Roe v. Wade that certain individuals in society had the right to decide to take certain other human lives, 
and from then on it was only a matter of deciding who pitched and who caught. The new law gave the medical profession a 
hunting license, with an implicit understanding that they were to eliminate the problem caused by millions of non-productive 
codgers and crones who were waving their canes and screeching their demands that they be taken care of as promised in exchange 
for a lifetime of submission and conformity. There are no statistics available as to how many Baby Boomers were shunted into the 
nursing homes and shortly afterward given the hot shot by mostly Jewish and Third World &quot;medical professionals,&quot; which 
towards the end could mean any Filipino who had gotten through a sixteen-week nurse&apos;s aid course and who could write English 
well enough to fill out the zillion necessary forms after he&apos; d whacked the old folks. By the time I was growing up, us white kids 
all had a pretty good idea of what was waiting for us at the end of the trail if we left ZOG in power. I always kind of suspected 
that was a large part of what made my generation finally decide to pick up a rifle. Some of us figured we might as well die from a 
bullet now as on the end of some kike&apos; s hypodermic needle fifty years on. 

As a joyful kicker. Dad&apos;s one remaining life insurance policy was invalidated. The company refused to pay, because they said my 
father&apos; s death was an Act of God. No, my father&apos; s death was an Act of Jew, which isn&apos;t quite the same tiling. Mom screamed and 
hollered for a while and ran to this jackleg lawyer we had in town named Stevens, who took the last $27,000 she managed to 
scrape up from somewhere in retainer and billable hours before informing Mom that the statute specifically forbade civil relief for 
acts of euthanasia committed in &quot;good faith&quot; and that since it appeared that Dad had been an alcoholic (well, he was) and was 
therefore really responsible for all of it himself, she had no case. The son of a bitch had known that all along before he took my 
mother&apos; s money, of course. It was well known that Stevens made a habit of scamming people on those Quality of Life A ct 
wrongful death cases, but Mom chose not to believe anyone who warned her. There was at least that much desperate, ruined love 
for Dad left in her, I think. 

I filed a murder complaint on Doctor Friedman with the War Prevention Bureau after the revolution, and I got him put on the Hit 
Parade. Me and a couple of hundred others whose old folks that kike bastard murdered. A few years later my father&apos; s killer was 
found dead in his Lexus in a parking garage in Philadelphia with a skull full of .22 hollow points and a Tarot card, the Prince of 
Wands, tossed on his dashboard. Always hoped I&apos;d find outwho the Prince of Wands was so I could thank him, butthe WPB 
keeps such matters pretty close to the vest. Lawyer Stevens got his as well, even before that. During the Cleanup, the NVA (no, I 
tell a lie, I think we were actually NDF by then) kicked in this legal beagle&apos; s office door as he was stuffing a big suitcase full of 
documents, either to destroy them or to flee the country. An hour later Stevens was turning slowly in the wind on an elm tree in 
the downtown park. The boys hung him with piano wire, so he twirled and danced like fish on the end of a hook and line for a 
long time, bobbing and gasping and pissing, while the crowd of onlookers cheered and applauded and laughed and cursed his soul

on its journey down to hell. Like I said, this particular jurisconsult had a reputation in our little community. AUes wird 
ahgerechnet. What goes around, comes around. 

My Mom told me something odd once. She said, &quot;Y our father was secretly very proud of you, Shane, although he would never 
have dared to say it out loud, to you or to anyone else. Y ou were doing what no man in his generation had the courage to do, least 
of all him.&quot; What struck me as odd was that Mom was sober when she told me this. 

I had two older brothers, neither of whom figure in my story. One of them became a drug addict. The year after I graduated high 
school he OD&apos; ed in Seattle on a speedball, a mixture of cocaine and heroin that his equally trashed- out girlfriend injected him 
with. It wasn&apos; t the drugs that killed him. She&apos; d just been so stoned there was an air bubble in the hypodermic and his heart seized 
up. I never had to track her down and kill her. She wasn&apos;t a bad or uncaring young woman, she was just screwed up like a Chinese 
fire drill. When she realized what she had done, she got on the computer and typed out a seven thousand- word suicide note full of 
gibberish, e-mailed it to everyone in her address book, and then she turned up the boom box full volume with some nigger rap 
song and committed suicide by shooting herself up with pure air. Her address book was mostly spammers and Usenet groups for 
lunatics, and so no one noticed the suicide e-mail, but my brother&apos;s Bengali landlord found the bodies after he broke into the 
apartment to shut up the boom box. After paying out the last of her savings to that goddamned attorney my Mom couldn&apos; t afford a 
funeral, and so she sold my brother&apos; s body to an organ chop shop at the hospital for spare parts. The girl&apos; s too, after no one 
claimed her. Mom stayed drunk for three months on the proceeds. 

My other brother fought on the other side. Well, joined it, anyway. He was too chickenshit to get his hands wet. He became a 
lawyer, to the eternal disgrace of our family. He married a chink and fled the country after Longview rather than end up swinging 
on a length of piano wire like Mr. Stevens and his other fellow officers of the court. Not to mention the crime of racial treason 
through miscegenation. I&apos;ve no idea where he ended up, nor do I care. Somewhere I probably have half-breed Asian nephews and 
nieces. If I&apos; d ever met any of them in my gun- toting days I would have wasted them without a moment&apos; s hesitation. Garbage is 
garbage, no matter whose blood happens to be intermingled with the yellow piss. So that&apos; s pretty much my biological family taken 
care of. They were all a pretty revolting bunch, truth to tell, and I&apos; 11 try to keep them as much out of this from now on as I can. The 

Wingfields were my real family. 

* * * 

Damn. How can I explain to you what life was like back then? 

The little girl from the university tells me the purpose of me sitting here maundering into the videocam is to preserve all this 
clutter for posterity, and also so future historians can listen to me and from my babbled fragments reconstruct the reason for The 
Awakening, as they&apos; re starting to call it. Y eah, I guess it&apos; s a pretty interesting question, if you think about it. For almost three 
generations the white race ate every serving of shit that ZOG chose to dollop out to us, grinning like egg- suck dogs while we 
scarfed it all down and licked the plate. So what changed? Just why, exactly, during the early decades of the twenty- first century 
did the white man finally decide to fight, at the eleventh hour and the fifty- ninth minute and the fifty- ninth second? What made the 
white man finally get up off his ass and pick up a gun after a lifetime of allowing the Federal government of the United States to 
do pretty much any damned thing they wanted to do? 
Hell if I know. 

I keep getting asked that all the time. I think some of us even talked about it among ourselves back then, to while away the hours 
on the bounce. Can&apos;t really remember what we ever decided, if anything. Y oung people look at me like I have the key to some 
great secret. If I knew it I&apos;d share it with you, believe me. It&apos;s sure something we need. Whatever the hell it was, our race didn&apos;t 
stumble across it until it was almost too damned late. But really, I don&apos;t know. When you live through something, it doesn&apos;t 
necessarily mean you understand every little thing about it. I&apos;ll tell you this much: I don&apos;t remember the war as being this big long 
heroic adventure that our NBA films and books and documentaries portray, that&apos; s for sure. Y ou want to know the truth of the 
matter, it wasn&apos;t a very pleasant experience. War isn&apos;t. Long periods of paranoid and nervous boredom broken by brief outbursts 
of madness and horror. But as to why white people finally revolted? The best I can tell you is that there wasn&apos; t any one reason, it 
was a whole combination of things that just happened to fall into place just right. Or wrong. Y ou can only push people so far, and 
at some point there was just some straw that broke the camel&apos; s back, and thanks to the Party and the Incomers, tiie white racial 
settlers from around the continent who came to the Northwest, we were able to reach critical mass and blow. 
Life is so utterly and completely different now it passes comprehension. I don&apos; t think anyone who&apos; s not of my generation can 
really imagine what it was like back then. Sometimes I sit here and I look at my grandchildren and I see the calm and safe, all- 
white world of peace and plenty they live in, this beautiful town of mine and this land of ours, and I swear I think I dreamed it all 
or imagined it, that my childhood and my young manhood was some kind of nightmare I had and then I finally woke up in the 
world as it should be. The main difference is that life is good now for most people. A white child has a chance now, a chance to be 
a child without fear and worry. A child can ride a bike and play down at the creek and walk home from school without any risk of 
being kidnapped and buggered and chopped into pieces by a pervert. A child has a chance to grow into a young man or a woman 
instead of a— well, what we were then, a kind of half- insane consumer zombie. People in the Republic are happy, mostly. Or at 
least you have a proper chance to be happy in the Republic, which we never had when I was young. Hell, when you don&apos; t have to 
look at niggers every day and you don&apos;t have to hear Spanish and Tagalog and Muklucky-Muck being gibbered everywhere, 
you&apos; re halfway to bhss already. 

But how can I describe to you what it was like when nobody was happy at all? It&apos; s like that bit I mentioned yesterday about every 
other person you saw on the street being fat? Y ou can&apos;t really believe that, can you? When was the last time you actually saw a 

A Distant Thunder 20 



grossly overweight person in your time here in the Republic? Y ears, I bet because our national diet doesn&apos; t include all that 
garbage people used to eat under ZOG. Junk foodjunk politics, and a junk life. The Northwest American Republic doesn&apos;t poison 
its own people to make money. That fact alone should give you a shrewd idea of one big difference between now and then. We 
don&apos; t do much of a nything here solely for the purpose of making money, which is something completely unimaginable in the 
world into which I was bom. Thatjewess Ayn Rand got her books burned right alongside the Marxism and the pornography. In 
cases where people have thyroid conditions we now have a simple enzyme therapy that soups up your metabolism and in a couple 
of months you&apos; re running marathons. That&apos; s just one example of a social problem that existed before the revolution, and which is 
now completely gone. There were about a hundred other little pissant things we had to put up with then that don&apos;t exist any more, 
from traffic jams to air pollution to functional illiteracy to foul-mouthed children talking like niggers. Nowadays only foul- 
mouthed old coots like me talk like niggers. Even now, I bet you half- disbelieve me or think I&apos;m exaggerating, right? There never 
really was any such thing as fat people, and this old fool is making all this up, right? That&apos; s okay, ma&apos; am. Disbelief is human 
nature and in this case it&apos; s a sign of healthy racial instincts. Christ, honey, do you have any idea how lucky you are not to have 
known any of this? How lucky you are thatyou don&apos;t know? How lucky you are thatyou can disbelieve? 
We did it all for you, you know. 

The main thing I suppose that stands out in my mind about life in them United States was that everybody was miserable. 
Wretchedly, bitterly, soul- destroy ingly unhappy. I think every white person alive in the year 2000 understood deeply and 
instinctively that something was terribly wrong with the world, even if they didn&apos;t know what My own childhood was pretty 
crappy, but it was by no means atypical, and in fact it was actually better than some. My parents were drunks but they didn&apos; t 
divorce, they neglected me but they never burned my fingers on the sbDve or beat me black and blue when I was a child, and I 
always had enough innate good sense not to pick up their bottle and to stay away from drugs. I wasn&apos;t bom with HIV or addicted 
to crack cocaine because my mother was a junkie, and I wasn&apos; t abducted and murdered and left in a ditch. 
As horrifying as it sounds, in many respects my family was emotionally and socially quite typical. Everybody was dysfunctional. 
There was no &quot;normal&quot; left From the richest kids on down to trailer trash like me, we lived our lives all doped up, dumbed down, 
zoned out pregnant half insane with rage all the time, confused, hostile, paranoid, dishonest vicious and mean and looking out 
for nobody but Number One. Everybody had problems, terrible problems that poisoned our very existence, and we were all being 
eaten alive. Life in the United States was a nightmare from which we were all desperately trying to awaken, but we never could. 
Nobody ever got a chance to stop and smell the roses. There weren&apos;t any roses left any more to smell, anyway. There was a weird 
kind of reverse Midas touch in operation throughout the world: everything America touched tumed to shit We were all too busy 
scrambling and scrabbling and scrimping for small sums of money to pay a hundred little pissant bills. Drivers used to go insane 
and murder one another over minor traffic mishaps. It was called road rage. Happened all the time. Y ou know what happens when 
you keep bDO many rats in bDO small a cage, ma&apos;am? They start attacking and eating one another. That was America at the 
beginning of the 2r&apos; centuiy. 

The majority of white marriages ended in divorce. At least a third of all young white men and women of marriageable age lived 
alone, because they couldn&apos;t stand one another. Feminism taught women to hate men, and the men retumed the favor. How can 
you marry and love someone you&apos;ve been taught all your life bD view as an enemy and a competitor? A whole generation of white 
children grew up as latch-key kids, dumped in a day care center or a school every moming before Mommy and Daddy or the 
single parent of the household went to work. The kids came home to an empty house and the boob tube, sometimes with a TV 
dinner sitting in the oven. More than any nigger gun or knife, more than any needle of heroin or line of coke, more than any 
perversion of thought practiced by the Jews upon our minds, this so-called liberation of women destroyed two generations of us. 
When a nation loses its women, it loses everything. 

Oh, it wasn&apos;t all bad. Nothing ever is. Sure, there was laughter, but it was a mechanical laugh track from TV. It was the shrill, 
forced laughter of people who were on the edge of the abyss and just barely coping, who knew they had to laugh at least a little to 
stay sane. There were good times in the old America I knew, but they all involved either deadening your brain with drink or dmgs 
or television, or withdrawing inbD some fantasy world on the computer every night or else doing stupid, dangerous, pointless 
things for an adrenalin msh, like bungee jumping or rock climbing or leaping out of airplanes and skateboarding down on a 
parachute. The good times had a kind of brittle, hysterical edge to them, a conscious effort to escape from a world that everyone 
knew in their hearts had tumed to purest dog doo. I apologize for my language, young lady, and I know such words aren&apos; t used in 
polite society any more, and so they shouldn&apos; t be. But if you want me to go back to that time then you&apos; re going to get all of it and 
one tmth about those times was that the American dialect of the English language had become negrified or ebonicized or whatever 
the hell you want to call it We all talked like whiggers back then. We didn&apos; t know any better. Hey, we heard blacks talking like 
that all the time on TV, and whatever was on TV must be right eh? Polite or not I&apos; m sure you&apos;ve heard it before from your older 
relatives. I once heard someone say we have the only society in the world where it s the grandmothers who shock and embarrass 
their granddaughters at the dinner table. 

Right getting back on track, how the hell do I explain to someone who never knew it what hfe was like under Zion? 
The first thing you have to understand is that in those days the United States was a society driven by one thing and one thing only, 
money. Christians call it the worship of Mammon. I have my own thoughts about God, but I will tell you this much: the only god 
A merica worshipped in the days of my youth was Mammon, gold ringing in the till so to speak. It wasn&apos; t real gold and silver like 
we use today, but numbers on a computer spread sheet They called it the bottom line and the bottom line mled every aspect of our 
existence. Everything was completely and utterly material and if you tried to suggest there might be something more in life than 

A Distant Thunder 21 



chasing the almighty dollar you were looked at like you were a lunatic. I remember seeing these little computer- printed signs on 
office walls about how &quot;Life is a game, and the one who dies with the most toys wins.&quot; There were people who actually believed 
that. I guess they thought that if they could only live long enough, science would find some way for them to take all their money 
and silly little toys with them. 

Seriously, I think that&apos; s what they were trying for. One of the big things you always heard about on the news in them days was 
various types of genetic and medical research into the possibility of immortality. By the time I hit my own teenaged years, the first 
wave of post-World War Two Baby Boomers were finally being carted off to the cemeteries and the fogey farms, and let me tell 
you, they did not go gentle into that good night Those Baby Boomers fought and scratched and kicked and screamed every inch 
of the way, absolutely refusing to admit that their generation was finally getting old. One of the biggest growth industries in them 
days was plastic surgery, botox injections, hormone treatments, every baldness cure you can think of, anything that might halt or 
reverse the Baby Boomers&apos; aging process. When I reached my own codgerdom I came to understand how they felt. Hell, no one 
wants to grow old, but dammit, you should at least try and be a man about it. There was always something desperate and pathetic 
about it in them days, all them hippy-dippy flower children from the 1960s scrambling and clawing to fight off the fact that their 
time was over now, and they&apos; d pretty much all done what they come here to do. It lacked dignity, and sometimes dignity is all an 
old coot or old crone has left in life. And ifyou work it right, that&apos; s enough. Well, you wanted stream of consciousness. 
Remembering all them hippy-dippy assholes trying to stay young or at least middle-aged was one of the first things to float to the 
surface in my particular stream. 

Money, money, money, it was all about money. Some asshole was always screaming at you demanding it, and no one ever had 
enough of it. Everybody except the very top echelon of truly wealthy people was always broke and up to their chin in bills and 
damned near insoluble financial problems. Mortgage, rent, credit card debt, car payments and repairs, sky-high utility bills, the 
astronomical cost of food and clothing if you were trying to raise a family. A nd G od help you if you or a member of your family 
got sick. Today the very thought of the medical vocation charging money to save people&apos; s lives and make sick little children well 
is held in revulsion. Free medical care is held to be a right in the Republic&apos; s Constitution right on up there with freedom of speech 
and religion and the right to keep and bear arms. But in those days a sick child or a heart attack would wipe out a lifetime&apos; s hard 
work in a few months and destroy the future of an entire family. 

America had three rules back then: don&apos;t be poor, don&apos;t be sick, and for God&apos;s sake, don&apos;t get old. I don&apos;t exactly cotton to being 
ninety-one years of age, but at least I&apos;m ninety-one here in the Republic. The thought of being old in the United States chills my 
blood to this day. I wouldn&apos; t have made it this far, actually, if we&apos;d stayed with ZOG. The state would have dragged me away to 
the fogey farm under the Senior Citizens&apos; Quality of Life act, which basically gave the government the power to throw old people 
away once their insurance ran out, and some Third World quack would have given me the hot shot long ago, like that kike 
Friedman murdered my Dad. The average life span of old folks locked up in those fogey farms was less than six months, 
especially the ones that were &quot;privatized&quot; as they called it back then, farmed out to entrepeneurs wearing turbans or yarmulkes. If 
I wasn&apos; t legally euthanized I would have died of neglect or been poisoned or beaten to death by my Filipino and Nigerian 
&quot;caregivers.&quot; Elderly people who had no money or whose insurance ran out, and that was most of &apos;em, got the short end of the 
stick hke you wouldn&apos;t believe. Social Security finally went down the tubes when I was— twelve? Thirteen? Can&apos;t remember- 
but even before Social Security went, there were old white people in America who lived on dog food, at least at the end of the 
month before their checks arrived. Once Social Security was gone, hfe for old people was a horror beyond comprehension. Ifyou 
had no children who were able or willing to take care of you, then the only alternative was one of those fogey farms run by the 
state if you were lucky and run by a turban or a yarmulke if you weren&apos; t. Then came the hot shot. 

Oh, there were a few of those hellholes run by &quot;faith- based initiatives,&quot; which was part of a complex system wherein tax money 
was funneled to the religious right in exchange for pro- Zionist bloc voting to keep the neo-cons in power and keep the endless war 
in the Middle East going. I remember seeing busloads of old people being driven up to the polls in Dundee and marched in, with 
their preacher handing tiiem their ballots at the door and a nice young deacon to escort each of them in and make sure they pulled 
the right levers. What were neo-cons? It means neo-conservatives. They were Jews who pretended to be conservatives. We 
eventually managed to track them all down and kill them. A ny way, at those &quot;faith- based&quot; fogey farms they made you jump for 
Jeeee-zus twice a week, as opposed to Jesus, in exchange for your bed in some crowded dormitory of sick and dying and half- 
insane old people. But I&apos; 11 say this, they at least kept you alive so you could vote, and indeed you&apos; d most likely vote a few times 
after you croaked, too. No, not Jesus, Jeeee-zus. What&apos;s the difference? Jesus is thesonof G od, Jeeee-zus was who the tub- 
thumping fools in the some of the churches jumped for. Long story, don&apos; t worry, I&apos; 11 ramble over in that direction eventually, 
when I talk about the Wingfields. They were into Jesus, notjeeee-zus. But that&apos;s really how you want to end your days, eh? In a 
warehouse for geezers. Several years before the revolution an epidemic of suicide among the elderly broke out. Tens of thousands 
of old people every year killed themselves with gas or pills or hanging or any guns they&apos; d managed to save from Schumer A ct 
confiscation. A lot of times it would happen when the cops or the IRS came to drag some poor old man or woman or couple out of 
their foreclosed home and take them to the fogey farm. The police would break in and find &apos;em dead. There&apos; d be some horrible 
story like that on the evening news nearly every day, back when I was growing up. That&apos; s one thing I remember from my 
childhood. Y ou always heard about old white people killing themselves. 

Of course, life wasn&apos; t exactly a breeze for young people either, if you had a white skin. Leastways if you had a white skin and you 
hked girls. When I say that it was all about money, you understand I&apos; m not referring to the consumer society of the late twentieth 
century. Three cars in the garage, split-level ranch home with a swimming pool in the back, two-hundred dollar tennis shoes 

A Distant Thunder 22 



named after some niggerball player, a closet full of clothes and a room full of computer toys, conspicuous consumption, the whole 
Brady Bunch scene— by the time I was coming along these things didn&apos; t exist any more, except for a very tiny minority of very 
rich people who lived in what were called gated communities, meaning fortified compounds with fences, armed guards and dog 
teams to keep the poor people of any race out. The American kids I knew when I was growing up were all poor and wretched, 
because none of the rich kids went to public schools. They had their own private schools that cost more for a semester than my 
father made in a year. W e all knew about the great A merican consumer lifestyle, of course, because we saw it every night on TV , 
but out in the real world that was the only place it existed. On TV. 

The fact was that during the first couple of decades of the twenty-first century, nobody had any money for all those fancy 
consumer goods and toys, except what you bought on your 29% interest credit cards. In the latter part of the twentieth century you 
could actually do a Chapter 7 and get out of the cards, but then along came &quot;bankruptcy reform&quot; which was pushed by the banks 
and credit card companies, with a cute little sub- clause that allowed for &quot;debt inheritance&quot; so you couldn&apos;t even really get out of 
that crushing debt by kicking the bucket All of a sudden not only you but your children and your grandchildren were saddled with 
paying for that SUV at 29%, for life. The loansharks would load you up with credit cards by the time you were 21, and then you 
spent the rest of your life in a kind of financial slavery paying the cards and their outrageous interest. If you were a guy, of course, 
there was the crushing alimony and child support from your first marriage. Everybody had a first or starter marriage in those days, 
and the way the courts were completely slanted against men, that was another form of financial slavery you could expect to last 
twenty or thirty years. Basically, a white male lived his entire hfe paying bills, and as the years went by and ZOG became more 
and more confused and incompetent and greedy, they became harder and harder to pay. The economic power structure thought 
maybe ten minutes ahead, if that. It stands to reason that you can&apos;t expect people to pay credit card bills on the one hand, while 
you&apos; re shipping their jobs out to India and Malaysia and Guatemala by the millions on the other hand. Y ou would have thought 
they would have figured that out and worked out some arrangement whereby at least the peons would have jobs to earn the money 
to pay their debts, but the system never did quite catch on to those little basics. Or maybe they knew it all along and just didn&apos; t 
care. Maybe they were just evil. 

I&apos;ve never been able to figure that out. How much of what we went through back then was because the Jews and the rich white 
men in business suits who ruled over us were just stupid and uncaring, thinking of us as their livestock to shear and slaughter as 
they like, and how much of what they did was because they were truly evil. It was both, I know, but I never understood in what 
proportion. Some of the stuff they did to us back then was so petty and cruel that they had to know it and just get some kind of 
kick out of it. Anyway, they all deserved nothing but a bullet in their heads and by God, some of them got it. 
Unemployment was a ghoul that was always present in our lives, there in the background, cold skeleton hands around our necks. It 
was something we lived with, like people in the Middle Ages lived with the Black Death, this terrible invisible demon that could 
descend at any moment and destroy everything we had. A few missed paychecks and it was welcome to the Salvation Army 
hostel. It&apos; s not that there was no work. There is always work to be done, anywhere, but for every unskilled and semi-skilled job 
there were hordes of Mexicans willing to work like cart horses for chicken feed. When the capitalists found it inconvenient to ship 
A merican jobs to the Third World, they brought the Third World here. When I was growing up you could still see a few white 
men doing manual labor, but by the time I was in high school every road crew, landscape crew, or roofing team was Mexican. 
Whole industries became closed to native- bom white Americans, as all the local convenience stores and filling station franchises 
and motels were bought up by Sikhs, Koreans, or Arabs who hired no one but their own relatives just off the jumbo jet White 
faces disappeared from behind the counters of stores and the kitchens of restaurants. One job after another, bottom rung 
employment was closed off to whites. Mexicans replaced whites at the lower end while Asians and Indians replaced whites at the 
high end. My Dad had a masters degree in structural design and a solid resume despite his drinking. When he was sober he was 
damned good at what he did. But he couldn&apos; t even get temp work because some Hindu or Chinese with a degree from Ching Hoo 
U. would work for half his rate. To complain or protest about this sitch invited an arrest for hatecrime under the Dees Act so 
whites ended up competing desperately and brutally with each other for the few jobs that were open to gringos. Since pretty much 
all the jobs that were available paid nothing but a crappy minimum wage that no white man could live on, never mind support a 
family on, it followed that no one could make it on just one job. Most people had two or three. It was by no means unusual to 
know a married couple who had five jobs between them, and that didn&apos; t leave much for the young guys like me coming up on the 
bottom rung with a couple of strikes against them already. 

Discrimination against whites, especially white males, was everywhere. It was just one of the things we all accepted and tried to 
work around. College admission was by quota unless the parents were rich enough to just plain buy a white boy in. I never even 
got onto the college track, because the guidance counselors knew my family had no money and I had no chance at a scholarship. It 
wasn&apos;t even discussed. But I remember from the few kids at Dundee High who were being considered for college track that the 
first thing their higher education counselors asked was if they could claim membership in any minority group. The employment 
discrimination against white A mericans took a dozen forms. It started with the growing demand down through the years that in 
order to get a job you had to speak Spanish. If you spoke only English then you just didn&apos;t get any job that required dealing with 
the increasingly foreign and non-white public, anything from a grocery checkout clerk to a telemarketer. Things got so bad that 
there were white parents who voluntarily gave up their own children to It Takes A Village in order to have them placed with 
wealthy liberals and faggots who could afford the adoption bond, because they knew it was the only way their kids would ever be 
able to go to college and have any kind of future.

By the time I hit high school, the safety net was pretty much all gone and you either knew somebody with a job who could get you 
in, or else you ended up on Workfare, which was state- paid slave labor for less than minimum wage. When that wasn&apos;t available, 
and it usually wasn&apos; t, you didn&apos; t work, period. Not hke our National Labor Service today where every citizen of the Republic is 
guaranteed some kind of gainful employment. The ZOG power structure had never really been comfortable with anything that 
involved white people taking money out of the kitty instead of putting it in. White males were like the peasants of the Middle 
Ages; our role in society was always to work so that all might eat. But capitalism decided we were too pricey, and so they brought 
in millions of Third World immigrants to replace us and more or less tried to breed us out of existence. Gradually, over a period of 
about fifty years, all the entitlements were chipped away and replaced with things like those big grants to the so-called &quot;faith- 
based initiatives&quot; I mentioned. In other words, it was still possible for white people of the right politically correct stripe to get their 
hooks into Federal tax money, all right, but not as something you were entitled to because you&apos; d worked like a dog all your life 
and paid in. Instead there appeared all kinds of political quid pro quo. The money was doled out in the form of &quot;community 
grants&quot;, etc. In other words, as bribes for votes and political favors. Politically, America became Chicago writ large. Racially, 
America became Brazil. 

Materialism was total. The only spiritual aspect to American life, if you want to call it that, was among a fairly significant number 
of quasi- fundamentalist Christians in what was known as the religious right, but that wasn&apos; t really a religion, it was just a 
theological smokescreen for Zionism, which is a political and racial ideology. The ones hke old Walter who were always jumping 
for] eeee-zus on TV or running around in public handing out those silly little comic books or hollering through bullhorns about 
how Israel was the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and God wanted us to slaughter every Muslim in the world who wouldn&apos;t bow 
down and convert. 

When I was growing up, everything we used or bought or saw around us was shoddy and half-assed. The stuff we bought at 
Mighty Mart was all cheap plastic made in Taiwan or some South A mericanshithole under NAFTA. Cars and computers and 
appliances were constantly breaking down because of substandard Third World workmanship and planned obsolescence. Nobody 
could spell correctly any more; even computer spell check programs had errors in them. The roads and highways were full of 
potholes. There were constant power outages and brownouts because the electrical grid was so archaic and overloaded. There 
were constant cases of ptomaine poisoning and botulism arising out of the fact that A merica wasn&apos; t even producing much of our 
own food any more; we were either importing bacterial mad- cow beef for our hamburgers or sending our own food overseas to be 
processed and canned up with whatever exotic Asian or African plague the workers in the latest capitalist paradise suffered from. 
The public schools were falling apart, and so were a lot of the private schools since no one had any money to support them any 
more and they had all succumbed to forced diversity and political correctness. Our textbooks were twenty years old and nothing 
but politically correct, dumbed-down drivel anyway. Our teachers were pig- ignorant and sometimes just barely spoke English. 
Health care, when you could get it, was substandard and mostly carried out by Third World immigrants whose medical degrees 
came from Roachistan U. There were regular scandals at the Veterans&apos; Administration hospitals involving death by neglect and 
murder of patients for sport by the staff, although once euthanasia for the elderly became law that was only a misdemeanor. 
A nother thing was the constant daily reminders that white people were a minority in our own land, and a despised one at that. Y ou 
turned on the TV and it was nothing but black and brown and yellow faces. Y ou went to the post office and tried to buy stamps 
from some hadji who&apos; d just walked off the jumbo jet and into a government job because back in Iraq or Saudi he&apos; d been a traitor 
who collaborated with the invaders of his country and been rewarded with a green card, but who didn&apos; t even speak English. In 
some cases our glorious Crusaders bribed whole Muslim armies to surrender without a fight that might produce embarrassing 
casualties by offering them all green cards, a practice that began with the First Gulf War in 1991. All around us, we heard a dozen 
languages, but above all the eternal gabble of that half-assed Spanish Central American Latinos speak. Everywhere we went it 
seemed there were brown- skinned immigrants of some kind ahead of us in line, always holding us up with their inability to speak 
our language. A Iways you wanted to scream out &quot; What the hell are you doing in my country?&quot; But if you ever did, if you ever so 
much as whispered a word of complaint or criticism, you were finished. Hatecrime [incomplete sentence] 
Anything non- white was officially cool and admirable and anything white or European was lame and contemptible. For white 
people, especially white males, there was a constant atmosphere of insult. On TV and everywhere else white men were portrayed 
as buffoons. We were all Homer Simpsons or Hank Hills. Those are old cartoon characters. I don&apos;t know if they are teaching kids 
in our Repubhc&apos; s schools today about Homer Simpson. If not, they should be, because that s how white men were portrayed, as 
bumbling, drunken, stupid fools instead of the head of a family who deserved respect and trust. One of the ways I think ZOG 
might have avoided the revolution is if they&apos; d just not insulted us all the time. If liiey&apos; d let us retain some kind of sense of dignity, 
pride, and self-worth. But noooooo, they just had to rub our noses in it 

W e all lived with a constant sense of fea r, especially fear of the informer. For years it was never official, it was j ust understood 
that there were certain things a white person, especially a white male, did not say and certain opinions one did not voice or else 
bad things would happen, anything from loss of employment to a malicious lawsuit to unpunished assault and murder by left-wing 
or non-white thugs. A couple of years before 10/22 ZOG got so nervous about the growing rumblings of discontent from the pale 
peasantry that they made it official. They passed the Dees Act, allegedly to &quot;promote diversity and protect minority rights in the 
workplace, including transit to and from the workplace, and in public institutions of learning,&quot; i.e. all public schools, universities 
and colleges, and any private school getting so much as a dime of Federal money. The Dees Act slapped a mandatory five-year 
prison sentence on anything and everything politically incorrect, from &quot;causing mental anguish on the basis of race, religion, 
ethnicity or sexual orientation&quot; to &quot;creating a hostile workplace environment&quot; &quot;inappropriately directed laughter,&quot; and &quot;deliberate 

A Distant Thunder 24 



exclusion from conversation and social interaction in the workplace.&quot; In other words, white people gathering in comers and 
talking to one another was in itself an act of insurrection, and every lunch table and extracurricular activity had to have an 
affirmative action quota of blacks, browns, and bugger boys to monitor what the pale peasants were saying. We were constantly 
bombarded with all this blather about how great Amurrica was and how we supposedly had all this liberty and freedom and that 
was why we had to &quot;fight for our country&quot; by going to the Middle East and slaughtering the natives. (Needless to say, any mention 
of Israel got airbrushed out of the picture real quick.) Liberty, my ass! Ordinary white people were always afraid. Any time a 
white person was about to make any kind of racial or other remark that might have seemed even faintly politically incorrect, they 
looked over their shoulder first to see who was hstening. That is the mark of a true pohce state. Any time you have to look over 
your shoulder for fear of who might be listening, you&apos; re not free. 

Then there was the almost obligatory race- mixing and perversion. In school and on the tube we were always having our noses 
rubbed in interracial couples, gay couples, man- sheep couples, you name it. We all somehow understood that of all the taboos, 
speaking out against seeing some white girl with a nigger or a mud was the strongest and that it would bring the most severe 
retaliation. Y et to me, and I know to most of my contemporaries, it never felt right. In Dundee itself, I am sorry to say race- mixing 
was, if not common, at least there. We only had a couple of blacks in town, but there were always illegal Mexicans looking for 
their La Go rdas, white women who were so hugely fat that having a spic marry her to get his green card was the only way she 
would ever get a man. The foulest thing of all was the sex education courses. Fortunately by the time it got really bad I was in 
high school and the system assumed I already knew the whole kama sutra, so all I had to do was collect my weekly condom ration 
in homeroom, which I then traded to convenience stores for a chili dog or a microwave burrito. But kids in elementary school 
were being given illustrated courses in various unnatural acts and told to pair off in class with someone of the same sex and kiss 
them. One outraged father in Dundee went to jail for hatecrime under the Dees Act when he pulled his son out of such a class and 
then lost it with the teacher and called him a faggot. Got the full nickel, too, but he was murdered by Mexicans in prison so he 

never completed his sentence.

But there was one problem, one issue that loomed over everything that America did in those days. The war. The Crusade, as it 
came to be called. If you want to get historically accurate about it, the Ninth Crusade. America&apos; s attempt to conquer the Middle 
East, steal all the oil in the world, civilize the native chappies at the point of a gun and make them love Israel or else. Some witty 
late-night talk show hosts even made cracks about taking up the white man&apos; s burden, until one of them was prosecuted under the 
Dees Act for inciting to hatred and the rest of them toed the line fast. That put a damper on humor as a weapon of criticism against 
the Oil Empire. I always noticed that about ZOO. They could never stand being mocked; ridicule was the one weapon they feared 
most. 

The constant fighting on half a dozen fronts in the Islamic world drained America like some mammoth blood-sucking leech. One 
reason that Social Security and Medicare went bust during the early part of the century was the fact that more and more of 
America&apos; s gross national product was being pissed down the rathole of our oil empire in the Middle East. Soldiers, equipment, 
money to hire and arm the local thugs as mercenaries like we did in Afghanistan and Lebanon, money for American mercenaries 
in the guise of &quot;private security contractors,&quot; rations, cluster bombs for dropping on babies, medical care for wounded, body 
armor, prosthetic limbs by the freight car load, millions for media propaganda, bribes to puppet governments, it just sucked 
everything America had down into a big whirlpool in the sand. It was actually a series of little wars, so many that most of us lost 
count, but we just called it &quot;the war.&quot; Us against the entire Muslim world except the few we could buy, like Turkey, and those 
never stayed bought. It had been going on as long as I could remember. When I was growing up there was never a time when 
American soldiers weren&apos;t coming back from some Middle East rat&apos;s nest in body bags, at least a couple every week. It just went 
on and on and on, as president after president who got elected out of the Jews&apos; pockets promised to bring the troops home and then 
reneged once they got into office, and we went on trying to make the world safe for Israel and grab all the oil while we were at it. 
The war hung over everything, and when the United States brought back the draft then all of a sudden it wasn&apos;t just blacks and 
Puerto Ricans and white trailer trash from Alabama who were coming back in those bags. It was real mass conscription and very 
hard to evade, because the empire was desperate for cannon fodder. I was ten years old when ZOG finally brought back the draft. I 
remember my Dad saying, &quot;Well, Shane, atleastyou&apos;llhaveajob waiting when you get out of school.&quot; Actually, though, I didn&apos;t 
Getting a bit ahead of myself, by the time I would have graduated high school I was made 4-F because I had a record of &quot;racism,&quot; 
and a lot of white boys very quickly picked up on the fact that as rough as it made life, one way to get out of being drafted was to 
get tagged as politically incorrect The Party got a lot of recruits that way, guys who came in for the draft deferment and stayed 
once ttiey learned what it was all really about and grasped the significance of the forbidden J word. I was always kind of amused 
that I spent many years of my youth fighting and defeating an army that had rejected me for &quot;lack of moral fiber.&quot; 
I had six or seven guys in my graduating class at Dundee High who were drafted and came back from some desert wearing toe 
tags. To be sure, the United States was never outright defeated— the Arabs never could stand up to the American military machine 
one on one in a set- piece battle and everybody knew it— but the Muslims turned out to be natural- bom guerrilla fighters. Plus it s 
kind of hard to defeat a man whose existence you have made so utterly miserable that he no longer minds strapping on an 
explosive belt and giving up his own life just to splatter your limbs all over the landscape as well. W e leamed a lot from the A rab 
guerrillas in the NV A , especially since we had a lot of veterans who had fought against them. If you know your history, you know 
the U. S. eventually had to throw in the towel over there, because even this huge continent s financial and natural resources were 
not inexhaustible. Not to mention the fact that us homegrown evildoers finally opened a &quot; second front&quot; for our A rab allies in the 

A Distant Thunder 25 



Northwest and distracted the U. S. long enough for them to finally take out Israel. I know that to this day there are still people in 
the Party and a lot of my old comrades who still aren&apos;t comfortable with the de facto alliance we worked out with the Arabs 
against our common enemy, but hey, Hitler found the Japanese to be suitable allies. In any case, as I&apos; m sure you know, by a 
special act of Parliament, the diplomatic delegation at the Palestinian Embassy in Olympia are the only non-Whites allowed to 
reside in the Northwest Republic, even temporarily. Them and a specially imported harem of dusky houris so they stay away from 
white women. They earned that privilege with their blood, just like we earned our country with our blood, and I don&apos; t begrudge it 
to them. 

Whattheneo- cons did in the Middle East was to wound the tiger, and then they didn&apos;t finish the job. Israel simply had too many 
enemies. Even the mighty United States, the only remaining superpower, couldn&apos;t destroy them all. They invaded Afghanistan in 
&apos;01 and Iraq in &apos;03 and from there it just went on and on and on, Iran and Syria and Lebanon and Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and 
eventually Pakistan and Libya and Malaysia, and when the Turks finally had enough of shilling for ZOG the A mericans invaded 
Turkey as well, but it was always very half-assed and confused. The United States simply didn&apos; t have the numerical manpower to 
occupy and crush the population of every Muslim country on earth. The result was constant guerrilla warfare in a dozen hotspots. 
A dmitting A merican defeat at the hands of a people whom we officially held in contempt as &quot;ragheads&quot; was a long, slow and 
sullen process and there was terrible and unnecessary death and pain involved. That&apos; s another way that the Jews could have stayed 
in power here in the Northwest, if they&apos; d just had sense enough not to try to conquer the world. The G reeks called it hubris. 

Overweening pride that insults the gods. Y ep, that was Y ehudi all right 

* * * 

I was involved in my first racial incident in the third grade, and was thereby marked forever as a bad kid. 
I was one of the budding young scholars at Martin Luther King Elementary School in Dundee. It&apos; s still there as Fourth Street 
Elementary, although they rebuilt everything from the ground up after the revolution and I don&apos; t recognize a damned thing when I 
go by there any more, except the playground where I jacked Bobby Fernandez is more or less in the same place. But jeez, my time 
in elementary school was just a little short of a hundred years ago, so why shouldn&apos;t it have changed? No, my racial incident was 
not with a nigger. We didn&apos;t have any black kids, although the school board kept trying to beg, borrow or buy some whose parents 
would let them be bused down from Olympia. Y ou have to bear in mind that outside the major cities, even up to 10/22, most of 
the Northwest was still almost all white, which was why this part of the world got chosen for our Homeland by the founding 
fathers back in the 1970s. But certain parts of the Northwest had labor intensive industries like forestry and logging and 
sawmilling and agriculture and fish processing, run by greedy capitalist bastards, and that drew Mexicans. A lot of Mexicans. 
Dundee was such a place, with our small fishing fleet and the Deep Harvest cannery, plus the logging and the plexiglass plant and 
that place that assembled cheap plastic furniture for mobile homes out of parts they imported from Indonesia. So we heard a lot of 
Spanish, and we also heard a lot of English telling us white boys that nobody was hiring. 

What happened at school was I clobbered that fat slob Bobby Fernandez with a chunk of concrete. Fernandez was one of the few 
Mexicans in school at that time, since most of our ille gales either sent their kids to Cathohc schools, or these weird little Hispanic 
Pentecostal schools run in basement storefronts where they jumped for Haaaay-seuss in Spanish, or in most cases didn&apos; t bother to 
send them at all. There were still a few occasional, faint flutterings of enforcement of the American immigration laws back in 
them days, although not many. By the time I was ten or so ZOG gave up the pretense and more or less just opened up the borders 
and said to hell with it. Oddly enough, I later came to learn that one of the reasons the Mex didn&apos;t like sending their kids to pubUc 
schools was that they didn&apos;t want their children corrupted by the filthy, greedy, no-values American consumer society. Strange to 
think of Mexican parents, who were in the process of destroying America and turning the United States into Brazil, being afraid 
their kids would be corrupted by us, eh? But considering the cesspool that mainstream A murrican culture was, in a way it makes 
sense. Ironic. They claimed they wanted to be Americans so bad they were willing to come here illegally and take everything we 
had, but when it came to their own children all of a sudden they didn&apos;t want to be Americans that bad. I can&apos;t blame them. 
Mexicans valued their own children in a way that white people back then never did. Mexicans knew that their children were their 
future. To most white people, kids were just an annoyance. Something to be avoided and aborted if possible, and ignored while 
growing up, farmed out to day care centers and school and the television set, the great electronic babysitter. That was always one 
way the Mexicans were able to beat us out. They kept their traditional if somewhat primitive values, and they kept their nuclear 
family units intact. Their men worked like dray horses and their women had mucho bambinos and raised them. Simply through 
breeding like rabbits, those people damned near destroyed four centuries of civilization on an entire continent. 
A ny way, this Bobby Fernandez was a chunky mestizo brat whose father was the town&apos; s first Hispanic city councilman, a labor 
contractor of course, the local je/e who delivered the madrugadores to the construction sites and the warehouses every morning, 
and from there it was just a step to delivering the Latino bloc vote to whichever party paid most for it, usually the Democrats. 
Illegals weren&apos; t supposed to vote, but hell, they weren&apos; t even supposed to be there at all, and every few years they&apos; d get amnestied 
and one or the other of the two parties would try to buy their votes by giving them citizenship in mass swearing-in ceremonies. 
Plus there was always plenty of fake ID around. One Rodriguez pretty much looks like another, so effectively they all voted, early 
and often. That&apos;s how Clinton the First won the 1996 election, if you want to get into obscure historical trivia. 
Bobby was an overgrown American junk food-chubby fifth grader who should have been in sixth, but he&apos;d already been held back 
one grade because he was so dumb that even the public school system of the time couldn&apos;t pass him. He had a special class 
schedule with Spanish- speaking teachers and he still couldn&apos;t pass. It wasn&apos;t a language problem, it was the fact that he was just as 
bird- brained in Spanish as he was in English. Fernandez was eleven years old, and already that spic had a little moustache. Swear 

A Distant Thunder 26 



to God! Bobby was your typical schoolyard bully, swaggering around with his little clique of hangers-on and butt buddies, some 
Hispanic and some white. That was a common enough phenomenon back then, weak-willed and deracinated white boys 
gravitating to blacks and Mex and other no n- Whites, in whom they sensed strength and some kind of identity. The kind of 
spiritual things that white kids didn&apos; t have. A M exican at least has a racial and national identity of sorts, just one that doesn&apos; t 
belong anywhere north of the Rio Grande. White kids didn&apos;t even have that when I was growing up. We were bom and raised to 
buy things at the mall. Then there were the white girls, most of whom gravitated to niggers and Mexicans because they had all the 
good drugs, but we won&apos;t get into that particular sickening topic for the moment. 

Back to Bobby and his little gang. Their specialty was picking on the smaller white children, robbing their milk money, eating 
their lunches, making them do bad and crazy stuff and getting them in trouble, so forth and so on. Eventually my turn came, but in 
my case it was worse. I was somewhat small for my age, and I was also blond and blue-eyed and I had nice, clear skin. I won&apos;t get 
into all the details, but suffice it to say that Bobby was old enough to have discovered what his peter was for besides pissing, and 
having grown up in the migrant labor camps from Baja California on up, he knew all the variations. He called his dick his 
chupacabra, which means goat- killer, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if... oh, sorry, ma&apos;am. I know, we don&apos;t talk about such things 
today. But unfortunately, when I was eight years old, that kind of filth was our daily fare. It was just something we lived with. 
Kids on the playground knew all the secrets of life by that age, and Bobby didn&apos;t have to draw me a picture. He made it quite clear 
from the beginning what he wanted from me. About the third time he unzipped his pants and I was only just able to get away from 
him and his crew through a combination of fast talking, subterfuge, and just plain running, then even at eight years old I 
understood that something had to be done. 

I knew my parents were useless, but I tried reporting it to the teachers, which needless to say didn&apos; t do me a damned bit of good. 
They told Bobby to be nice and that just pissed him off because I&apos; d informed on him. It made him more aggressive and increased 
the time and effort I had to spend avoiding him. For the first time, I ran into that massive disinterest always to be found in official 
places when it came to protecting smaller, weaker people with white skins from big bullies with dark skins. It wasn&apos; t as bad as it 
got later on, but even back then when I was eight, political correctness had gotten so bad that the school authorities were scared to 
discipline an eleven year- old thug and sodomite because his name ended in &quot;ez,&quot; although a seven year- old white boy in 
Longview who brought a Swiss A rmy knife to school later that year was permanently expelled and denied admission to any pubhc 
school in Washington state. That kid&apos; s family had to move away. 

I understood that I was completely on my own, that there was no one on earth who was going to lift a finger to help me. Let me 
tell you something, that is a terrible, an unspeakable burden for a child of eight to cany. No child should ever be alone like white 
kids were when the political correctness of Zion ruled this land. I didn&apos; t have a father who was worth a bucket of warm spit, but 
we had a television, so I knew from watahing pro wrestling what I had to do. One day I went out back to where the tarmac in the 
parking lot was breaking up. That crumbling infrastructure I mentioned before, crumbling literally in this case. I selected a good 
heavy chunk of broken- off concrete that I could heft in both hands, I got up on an embankment behind the playground and crept 
up on Bobby while he leaned against a wall smoking a cigarette, and before he knew it I was on him. I gave him a couple of good 
whacks with the piece of concrete. He went down screaming in Spanish, and I went down on top of him and kept on smashing at 
him clumsily with the concrete, red splattering blood slapping all over me. I was prepared for that from watahing the wrestlers 
when they whupped on one another with chairs and brass knuckles and fire extinguishers. Fernandez was pretty much of a mess 
when a couple of teachers finally screwed their courage to the sticking point and pulled me off him. One of them asked me why I 
had done it. It was then I committed an error that made my life what it was to be. I yelled out, &quot; That greaseball spic wanted me to 
suck his dick, so I smushed his fucking head!&quot; 
Whooooa, baby! White trash city for life, here comes Shane Ryan! 

From that point on, the bottom fell out. I had done the unforgivable. I had said spic. Well, it could have been worse. I might have 
said nigger. Mmm. . . maybe not. I mean, nigger was of course the ultimate forbidden word, a kind of living death if you uttered it, 
and if you were over thirteen years old and on the grounds of a public school and you said it or you were caught with a copy of 
Huckleberry Finn then it would be prison under the Dees Act, but nigger is only one forbidden word, whereas I had actually used 
two, albeit of somewhat lesser value. But the two of them combined? Did a spic and a greaseball put together actually outweigh 
one nigger in terms of politically incorrect horror? I learned later that whole school board meetings were held about my case, in 
attempt to resolve just that very knotty spiritual problemo of political incorrectness. Kind of the liberal equivalent of how many 
lesbians can dance on the head of a pin. 

The hell of it was that I was not in fact what they called &quot;prejudiced.&quot; For God&apos;s sake, I was a child! I knew that Mexicans were 
usually brown- colored, and they spoke a different language, but that was about it All the Speedy Gonzalez cartoons had been 
pulled off TV by the time I was bom, but we had the Bumblebee Man and the little talking chihuahua and I thought they were 
funny. When Mom was too dmnk to make dinner, as she often was, Taco Bell was one of my favorite meals. I liked the big plate 
of tostitos with guacamole. At that age it wasn&apos;t a race thing. It was a kid thing. I would have done the same to a white kid who 
waved his wang in my face and had his gang try to force me down on my knees in front of him. I&apos;ve often wondered what would 
have happened if the teachers and school administrators had treated what happened as exactly what the hell it was, a schoolyard 
squabble between children, and made me and Bobby both write &quot;I will play nice&quot; two hundred times on the blackboard. But kids 
were very much a political commodity in those days. The grownups acted hke I was engaging in some kind of violent insurrection 
against the estabhshed authorities. I wasn&apos;t Not yet anyway. All I wanted was for that big greaseball to leave me alone and being 
eight years old, I could not understand why that was too much to ask. But it was. I was too young to comprehend that in any 

A Distant Thunder 27 



human tyranny, the one wish that tyranny can never grant is simply to be left alone. No one can stop the merry-go-round and get 
off. No one must be left outside the circle of misery. All must participate. All must sing hosannahs and all must bum the pinch of 
incense before the altar of the false gods of Zion. 

I was dragged into the principal&apos; s office, my parents were called, I made the front page of the Dundee Advertiser as indubitably 
the next Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan if we&apos;d had one in Washington, my father lost his current job several months before 
he would have in the normal course of events through being drunk all the time, and we had several bricks thrown through the 
windows of our house by dumb-ass white teenagers who only knew that it was now okay to throw things at us. (Later on when I 
was with the NVA, we were the ones who told punk kids like that who it was okay to throw stuff at.) I normally would have been 
expelled like the kid with the Swiss Army knife, but at that time there was a new solution being tried out in the Washington public 
schools to deal with hideous racists hke me. It was called SOBOR, Social Behavioral and Outlook Reconditioning, and the state of 
Washington paid milhons to a whole set of psychobabble wonks to come up with it. I ended up being &quot;de-Nazified&quot;. Swear to 
God! An eight year-old! 

For the next three days I didn&apos; t go to class. I was escorted everywhere by an adult faculty member like I had some kind of disease, 
forbidden to speak to any of the other children and they were forbidden to speak to me. I was an official pariah and made to feel it 
I was taken off into an isolated room, surrounded by imposing psychobabbling adults, and made to watch a lot of videos about 
Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan, including all kinds of nasty photos of lynched niggers dangling on trees and skeletal inmates with 
numbers tattooed on their arms and burned skeletons and big pits full of bodies from alleged Nazi concentration camps. But the 
child psychologists the state sent down stopped that after they got what they referred to as &quot;contra- indications.&quot; Fact was that I 
was enjoying it. I thought all the skeletons and dead bodies and such were neat, a lot more wonderfully gross and horrible than 
those stupid monsters Scooby-Doo and the gang chased and who always turned out to be villainous white guys wearing costumes. 
Well, what the hell did those educated idiots expect from a kid raised on American television who by age eight would have 
already seen fourteen thousand two hundred murders and acts of dismemberment on the boob tube, or whatever the statistic was? 
Plus that was my first sight and sound of the Fiihrer A dolf Hitler, and I was completely fascinated. Scattered in with all the rest 
were a few clips from the Nuremberg rallies. I didn&apos;t speak word one of German, but even in those grainy old films from the 
1930s there was something... I knew the Fiihrer was speaking to me, and that he was saying something vitally important, but I had 
no idea what it was. Leni Riefenstahl, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, kameradin. 

Anyway, the psych mooks from Olympia picked up that I wasn&apos;t getting with the program and so they switched to something 
called &quot;Learning Tolerance,&quot; with videos of all kinds of little children of all races dancing around and throwing plant life at each 
other and grinning little niglet boys putting flowers in little blonde white girls&apos; hair and stroking them, and the little white girls 
going tee hee hee, you get the idea. For some reason I did not understand, I wanted to punch the niglets in the face. They just 
seemed dirty and horrible, ugly stupid monkeys, and I did not want them to be touching the little white girls. I did not want them 
to be, period. From somewhere, God knows where, I had inherited healthy racial instincts. 

The psychologists were always asking me stupid questions and trying to make me sing songs about red and yellow, black and 
white, we are precious in His sight. I told them I couldn&apos;t sing. Well, I couldn&apos;t. They kept on and I just got really mulish about 
the whole thing and said I didn&apos; t want to sing, and then they asked me why I didn&apos; t want to sing and did daddy ever touch my 
peepee in a bad kind of way and that kind of crap. (The fact that a few years later they were teaching children that very behavior in 
class is a contradiction I&apos;m sure always escaped them.) Somehow I was able to convince them that my parents weren&apos;t perverts, 
just drunks. I made things worse by refusing to get up at an assembly in front of the entire school and apologize to that greasy 
little blot Fernandez. That really drove them nuts. I didn&apos;t understand it then, but this was in fact the most important part of the 
&quot;de-Nazification&quot; process— the deliberate, public humiliation of the white male who has dared to question, who has dared to 
resist I wouldn&apos;t play the game. I refused to debase myself. I refused to be humiliated, and that scared them pea-green. I think in 
their own way they had some vague idea of the sleeping giant that was about to awake in the land, and I could sense that they were 
afraid. I was well on the way towards becoming an irredeemable case. I had them tearing their hair. Eight year-olds were supposed 
to be pushovers. 

Finally they brought a Burger King down from Seattle, although of course I didn&apos;t call him that in my mind at the time. I didn&apos;t 
even know what ajew was. On the third day I was taken in to the principal&apos; s office. Mr. Jenkins left and I found myself facing a 
plump little man with thick glasses and a big nose and a frizzy reddish beard that looked like pubic hair, and a little blue and white 
knitted beanie on his head. &quot;Hello, Shane,&quot; he said in a friendly voice. His glasses reflected the flourescent lights on the ceiling in 
an odd way and kind of blanked out his eyes with white light so it was like I was talking to some kind of funky robot which I 
actually thought was pretty funny. I smiled at him because he looked really dumb with no eyes and the beanie, and he no doubt 
took that as me being overawed by his magisterial presence. God, kikes are such arrogant bastards! &quot;My name is Jacob 
Mandelbaum,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Y ou can call me Doctor Jake. Or Rabbi Jake, because I&apos; m also a rabbi. Do you know what a rabbi is, 
Shane?&quot; 

&quot;No, sir,&quot; I said. By this time I had figured out that it was best if I said as little as possible, even though that as well had its perils, 
because they claimed I was being &quot;unresponsive&quot; and I couldn&apos;t stay in school and Dad wouldn&apos;t get his job back and we would 
have to go live in a Motel 6 unless I was responsive to the social reconditioning therapy, at which point they totally lost me. It was 
winter and what did air conditioning have to do with anything? But I&apos;d tried simply explaining what happened with Bobby 
Fernandez and that just made them mad, and I&apos; d made a couple of attempts to figure out what they wanted to hear and say that so 
they would let me go and leave me alone, but it just led to them trying to trip me up with more questions like the stupid ones about 

A Distant Thunder 28 



Dad allegedly touching my peepee and others even more deranged. I had no idea what was happening to me or why, and so I&apos;d 

decided I&apos;d best clam up as much as they&apos; d let me and see if I could get away with giving them some kind of bare minimum to 

make it all go away. At eight years of age I didn&apos; t think all this out quite in those terms, but close enough. 

Doctor- Rabbi Jake told me, &quot;Well, Shane, I am of the Jewish faith, and in my rehgion a rabbi is kind of hke a minister or a priest 

in a Christian church, but also much more. Among Jewish people a rabbi is a teacher, and he spends most of his hfe accumulating 

wisdom. Y ou see, long ago in Bible times, God Himself chose the Jewish people as his very best and favorite people on earth, and 

gave us the task of guiding and inspiring all the rest of the peoples of the earth so that they will be good and do His will. In order 

for us to accomplish this divine mission. He gave us His word as set down in the holy books, the Torah and the Talmud, and in 

every generation He gives the Jewish people and all of mankind certain holy men, great rabbis called tzaddiks, which means 

saints. These men spend their lives studying those holy books so they have answers for all questions and so they have all the 

knowledge on earth that mankind ever really needs to know. The Jewish people are the custodians of that divine knowledge, 

Shane, and I am proud and happy to say that finally, after many thousands of years, the nations of the earth are beginning to 

acknowledge that fact. Our great A merican President and our wonderful A merican soldiers who are fighting for democracy and 

freedom in the Middle East are striking down the enemies of God and bringing more and more of earth&apos; s peoples into the 

Brotherhood of Man, which is the ultimate goal of Judaism. And of course they are also reaping the bounty that God gives to those 

who do his will, in the form of the petroleum reserves which have been so long abused by the wicked sons of Ishmael, who are 

only now being taught the wrongness of their false faith and their hateful ways.&quot; 

&quot;Ishmael?&quot; I asked. I had a vague impression in my mind of Moby Dick. 

&quot; Y es, Shane, Muslims are the sons of Ishmael by our father A braham, but not righteous children. The J ewish people are the sons 

of A braham by his true wife Sarah who bore Isaac, but Muslims were bom of Sarah&apos; s handmaiden, a shiksa slave named Hagar, 

and so all Muslims are the sons of a whore and thereby bound to serve the true children of Abraham, the Jews . Never mind, that&apos;s 

theology and it&apos; s a bit beyond you now. If you go to a true Christian church your preacher can explain this to you later. But I have 

more than the knowledge of the word of God, Shane. I&apos;m also very learned in the science of the human mind.&quot; 

&quot; Y ou&apos; re a shrink?&quot; I asked. I had heard about shrinks. 

&quot;Y es, Shane, I&apos; m a shrink,&quot; said Mandelbaum with a delighted chuckle. 

&quot;Are you going to put me in the cackle box?&quot; I demanded. I knew about the cackle box from TV. It had rubber rooms and people 

wore white jackets with arms all tied up and everybody yelled and laughed and cried and screamed until the nurses came and gave 

you shots that turned you into a zombie and then you ate bugs like Renfield and sat around all day weaving baskets. 

&quot;Oh, I don&apos;tthmkyourcaseisquiteso bad as to require institutional treatment, Shane,&quot; replied Doctor-Rabbijake with a smile, 

but I could tell he wasn&apos; t quite sure and I was definitely on my guard. &quot;But you see, I am a doctor of the mind. Y ou did something 

very bad, something which tells me that everything isn&apos; t right in your mind, Shane, that indeed something is very sick in your 

mind. I want to make you well. I believe Doctor Anderson and Ms. Winslow- Panetta have explained to you what racism is?&quot; 

That one I had down pat from watehing the videos. &quot;If s when you don&apos; t like people who are different than you,&quot; I recited by rote. 

&quot;Mmmm, not exactly, Shane,&quot; said Doctor-Rabbijake. &quot;It&apos;s when you hate people who are different from you. Do you know 

what hate is, Shane?&quot; 

&quot;Hate is when you really, really, really don&apos;t hke somebody real bad.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, again, close but no cigar. Hate is when you don&apos;t like someone because of what they are. What they may do is irrelevant. 

Hate is not an emotion, it is a political position, one that can no longer be tolerated in civihzed society. It&apos;s not just a psychiatric 

issue, it&apos; s a criminal issue, and as such it is treatable by legal means. Hate is a social disease of the mind, Shane, and it is the duty 

of my profession to make sure that no one in America suffers from this disease and that everyone in America is all right in their 

minds, and not thinking bad thoughts. Humanity has just come through a very bad century, Shane, but we learned a lot from it. We 

learned that all of the world&apos; s problems are caused by hate, specifically hatred by people of your race and gender. White males 

like you who hate people who are of different colors and religions and sexual orientations are a cancer on the body of society and 

you have to be excised, even if as in your case you are too young to understand all the reasons for it. I know this is a bit much for 

someone your age to understand, but for many past centuries of history white males like yourself rampaged through the world like 

marauding ghouls. Y ou did very bad and cruel things to people of color, to indigenous peoples like the Native Americans and the 

peoples of sub- Saharan Africa, to women of all colors, to gay people, and last but not least, you did terrible and evil things to my 

own J ewish people. Nowadays we&apos;re much wiser. We understand the evil that hatred has done in the past and the pain and the 

suffering that it still does, like what happened the other day on your playground between you and Roberto Fernandez. We 

understand that we have to stop the hate, Shane, stop it by whatever means necessary, and the best way to stop it is to nip it in the 

bud. 

&quot;Now, Shane, your mind is full of hate. Y ou might say that your mind is broken, and I have come all the way down here from 

Seattle to fix it. I don&apos;t know exactly where you got this horrible sickness of racism from. It could be almost anywhere. Despite all 

the gains we have made in the past fifty years, American society is still deeply and pervasively racist, and anything and anyone 

can turn out to be an agent of the infection, sometimes even without knowing it Somehow or another we have to get inside your 

mind and we have to get rid of all that horrible hate. We have to cleanse your mind, Shane, and your soul as well. We have to 

scrub away all that dirty and horrible old hate, and make your mind and your heart and your soul new and shiny and squeaky 

clean. Now Shane, I want you to tell me why you so atrociously attacked and injured little Roberto on Monday?&quot; 

&quot;Because he kept trying to make me suck his dick and I didn&apos; t wanna! &quot; I said for what must have been the two hundredth time. 

A Distant Thunder 29 



Mandelbaum scowled. &quot; Shane, do you know what homophobia is? No, of course not. Y ou should know by your age, but you 
don&apos;t, because you&apos;ve never been taught Those proto-fascist bigots in the state legislature are still dragging their feet on bringing 
sexual diversity education, although I&apos;m pretty sure we&apos; re going to get the votes next session. But what I want to know, Shane, is 
who exactly told you that an approach for sexual contact from someone of the same gender requires a violent response? In other 
words, who told you it was all right to hurt another boy who wants to play with you in that way? W as it your father?&quot; Jeez, I 
thought, there they go on Dad and peepees again. Whuzzup wid dat? (I told you, we all talked and thought like whiggers back 
then. We got it off rap videos on TV.) 
&quot;I just don&apos;t wanna do that,&quot; I said sulkily. &quot;It&apos;s dirty.&quot; 

&quot;But why not, Shane?&quot; Mandelbaum pressed me. &quot;Whatmakesyouthinkthat? Who told you it was dirty? Was it your parents?&quot; 
I was desperately groping around in my mind for something to say that would get off this topic. I didn&apos;t understand why, but 
somehow I understood within me that it was just wrong to be talking about little boys sucking on one another&apos; s peepees. &quot;The 
Bible says it&apos; s dirty! &quot; I told him. I had no idea whether or not the Bible actually said that, but I had some vague feeling that this 
was the case. I knew the Bible didn&apos;t like anything to do with peepees. Don&apos;t ask me where I got that. Not off TV, that&apos; s for sure. 
&quot;Ahhhh... .&quot; exhaled Doctor- Rabbi Jake with satisfaction. &quot;Now we&apos;re getting somewhere! Do your parents read the Bible to you, 
Shane?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; I said. Of course my parents didn&apos;t read the Bible to me. They didn&apos;t read anything to me or to themselves. They didn&apos;t do 
anything except drink and fight and pass out on the floor. It was an incredibly stupid question. 
&quot;Shane, you can tell me,&quot; said Doctor- Rabbi Jake soothingly. &quot;!&apos; m your rabbi, remember?&quot; 

&quot;Well, my Mom has a Bible,&quot; I said, floundering around trying to figure out what he wanted to hear, and it was true. My mother 
did have one. It was a Gideon Bible that for some reason she had stolen from a hotel room some years before. She used it to prop 
open the kitchen door for a while, and later on as a coaster for her highball glass. 

&quot;Aha!&quot; exclaimed Mandelbaum. &quot;Now, Shane, I want you to think carefully. This Bible that your mother reads to you from, do 
you know if it&apos;s something called a King James Bible?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; I said. That much I did know. I&apos; d been alone in the house one rainy day and I&apos; d picked it up off the coffee table, 
opened the whiskey- stained covers and looked it over. I got bored with it after a while and never tried to read it again, but I did 
remember the words &quot;King James Translation&quot; in faded gold letters on the black pseudo- leather spine. 
&quot;That, to my mind, is conclusive,&quot; said Doctor- Rabbi Jake, sitting back in the principal&apos; s chair in satisfaction. &quot;Y ou see, Shane, 
the King James Bible is a very old version, and it has some beautiful language in it, coming as it does from the time of 
Shakespeare... &quot; 

&quot;Who?&quot; I asked. It was a funny name. In my mind I saw some guy shaking a spear around in the air. 

&quot;A h, never mind, Shane, he is a dead white European male from very long ago and he is no one you&apos; 11 ever need to know about. &quot; 
(Who would have thought the old man had so much blood in him?) &quot;But because the King James version is so very old, written in 
the time when only white males were allowed to have any power or influence in the world, it contains a lot of hate, such as the 
command in Genesis about each species seeking after its own kind. One of the many divine injunctions which was intended only 
for the Jewish people, which shows the danger of allowing goyim, er, I mean non-Jews to have anything to do with the Bible at all. 
It&apos; s like giving a child a loaded gun. The K ing J ames is especially hateful against gay people because of the gross mistranslations 
of Leviticus and people in racially mixed relationships, as witness that horrible story in Numbers about Phineas. Fortunately we 
now live in a much more enlightened age when Christian theologians with the input and assistance of Jewish scholars have 
produced several far more inclusive versions. I think the first step is definitely to have a word with your mother, and persuade her 
to hand over that King James she is clearly unfitted to possess or use and accept instead a copy of one of the inclusive versions... &quot; 
To this day I don&apos;t know what would have happened if Doc- Rabbi Jake had gone to our house and demanded that whiskey- 
sodden, stained, tattered old Gideon Bible from my Mom. She probably would have sold it to him for the price of a bottle of Jim 
Beam. But then I did it again, and this time I really screwed myself for life. A sudden thought struck me. &quot;Doctor Rabbi Jake, 
white people aren&apos;t supposed to hate people with dark skins, right?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;That&apos;s right, Shane. It is very wrong,&quot; said Mandelbaum primly. 

&quot;Then what about Muslims?&quot; I demanded. &quot;Mohammed who used to work down at the Speedy Mart on Harrison Avenue was a 
Muslim, and when some big kids from Centralia beat on him with tire irons everybody in town chipped in to hire Mr. Stevens as 
their lawyer and the judge let them off with a fine because they were drunk and they were just defending their country and 
standing up for Amurrica, and there was this colored girl in sixth grade, her name was Amina, and she had long black hair but she 
wore this long scarf over it, and somebody said she was a Muslim and a terrorist, and Mrs. Sackett made her stand up in front of 
the class and she ripped off the scarf and showed her hair to all the boys and they laughed at her, and Mrs. Sackett made Amina 
stand up and pledge allegiance to the flag and kneel down before a picture of Jesus or she couldn&apos;t come to school any more and 
the school board said she was just standing up for A murrica and supporting our troops, and then A mina&apos; s house got set on fire by 
the Baptists and they moved away. Mushms have colored skins but Mrs. Sackett and Mr. Hansen and Ms. Rawlins and Ms. 
Gelinsky say they&apos;re bad and Amurrica has to go into their countries and kill them unless they get civilized and make peace with 
Izrul and give us all their oil to prove they&apos;re civilized now.&quot; 

My defending Mushms? No, it wasn&apos;t that. That was something the Burger King could have handled from a child, and I am sure 
he had a stock set of facile answers on hand for such a sitch. But completely unwittingly, I had freaked him out. I used a dirty 
word. A Party word. First time in my life I ever said it, years before I even knew the Party existed, and I had no idea on earth what 

A Distant Thunder 30 



I was saying. My destiny called, and I didn&apos;t even hear or understand it. Mandelbaum froze. &quot;Who told you to say America like 

that?&quot; he hissed. All of a sudden he was no longer friendly robot Doctor- Rabbi Jake. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; I asked, not having the slightest idea what the Jew was talking about. 

&quot;You said &apos;Amurrica&apos; !&quot; said Mandelbaum, his voice trembling and ponderous, accusing, heavy with menace. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; I responded. &quot;Amurrica. That&apos;s our country isn&apos;t it? Why shouldn&apos;t I say Amurrica?&quot; 

&quot;There are some very, very bad people who say Amurrica, Shane,&quot; said Mandelbaum, rising from his seat behind the principal&apos;s 

desk like some towering, threatening mountain of Philadelphia cream cheese. He had completely and totally lost me. We lived in 

Amurrica, right? At least, that&apos;s what I had always behoved. Was everyone around me insane or lying? What the hell was this 

crazy man mad at me about? &quot;Who told you to say Amurrica?&quot; he almost shouted. 

&quot;Everybody,&quot; I said, completely mystified. &quot;Everybody says Amurrica!&quot; And it was true. Everybody who was eight years old did 

say Amurrica instead of A-MAY-rica or A-MER-ica. Jesus Christ on a raft, you stupid— we were children, you stupid 

motherfuckers... ! Ma&apos; am, I&apos;m sorry, I did it again, I understand that word is a revolting niggerism which is no longer in any way 

acceptable in polite society, and yet again I must ask your understanding and that you to remember my age and where I came 

from. Isn&apos; t it strange, though? A fter all these years, I still hate them, and it&apos; s not because of the many much more horrible things 

they did. Not for their murder and their tyranny, not because of the poverty and misery and denial of our very humanity, but it&apos; s 

the little, stupid wicked things that ZOG did that still enrage someone like me, after all these years. Browbeating and bullyragging 

on a child. The banality of evil, I have heard it called. They were real, real good at hurting children, those pieces of human 

garbage who ruled when we were the United States. It was their speciality. 

Mandelbaum came around the desk and leaned over. His proboscidian visage was right in my face. &quot;Shane, I am going to give you 

one last chance to tell me the truth. Otherwise I will be forced by my duty to humanity to invoke a new law that our country has 

been forced to impose in order to deal with this kind of situation. The law of It Takes A Village. Y ou cannot be allowed to remain 

in this shocking, vicious, racist environment.&quot; Well, he got two out of three right My home environment was shocking and 

vicious, but not racist Just drunk. &quot;Now you will tell me the truth, Shane! Have you ever seen a flag, a wicked and evil flag with 

three sections, one blue, one white, one green? Have your parents ever shown you such a flag or anything, a picture, a coffee mug, 

anything with such a flag on it?&quot; 

A sudden inspiration hit me. A 11 of a sudden I thought I understood. &quot; Y ou&apos; re from there, aren&apos; t you! &quot; I said, suddenly impressed. 

&quot;From where?&quot; asked Mandelbaum, caught off balance. 

&quot;The cackle box!&quot; I replied enthusiastically. &quot;I saw this video once where one of the guys in the cackle box was trying to 

eggscape, and he took off his clothes and got into this place where he was nekkid and a doctor came in a white coat and the guy 

knocked him out on the head and took his white coat and his stessascope and his car keys and the guy stole the doctor&apos; s car and 

went to this town and got this girl and told her he was a doctor and then he went to her house and they got nekkid and did stuff and 

then some other guy came and he knew the first one wasn&apos;t really a doctor and they had a big fight and the one who was 

pretending to be the doctor stabbed the other guy and the girl ran outside all nekkid with her boobs bouncing and she was yelling 

help help and the cops came but the guy who was pretending to be the doctor ran off and hid in the woods and then he went to this 

old house and he found this mast and a ole chain saw and he put the mast on his face and he got some gas from a can and he 

started up the chain saw and then he goes looking for the girl again to chop her up with the chain saw. . . &quot; 

Doctor Mandelbaum stood up and slapped my face. He looked at me with freezing contempt and anger. &quot;Freud was right Y ou 

people are beyond all help. No matter how sincerely one tries, it is impossible to treat a sociopath.&quot; He wheeled and threw open 

the office door. &quot;Jefferson!&quot; he shouted out like our principal was his errand boy. &quot;Get this little fascist son of a bitch out of here! 

Make sure he has no contact with any other students!&quot; The janitor, Mr. Gray, came and took me down to his little office and let 

me watch an old Judge Judy re- run on his little TV, and he also gave me a bag of Doritos. 

They called my parents. I think Mandelbaum was serious. He was about to invoke It Takes A Village. The law that allowed the 

state to take healthy white children away from &quot;racist&quot; homes and place them for adoption with politically correct people who 

could afford to pay the six and sometimes seven- figure adoption bonds. For some reason It Takes A Village never seemed to take 

an interest in &quot;unsuitable home environments&quot; where the kids concerned were black or brown. There were, after all, plenty of 

those available for normal adoption. Only white children were sufficiently rare to merit being kidnapped at gunpoint by the United 

States. My Mom was either out physically at work (she always made it to work, I&apos; 11 give her that) or else she was out on the floor, 

and since Dad was now out of work again he was home and reasonably sober when they called, so it was my Dad who came down 

to deal with the latest crisis of the problem child who had just accused his Jewish shrink of being an escaped mental patient 

Now comes a mystery. 

My Dad went into that office with Mr. Jefferson and Mandelbaum at about three in the afternoon and he came out at about four. 

He came down to Mr. Gray&apos;s little room and without a word the janitor opened his drawer and handed my father a bottle in a 

brown paper bag, from which he took a long pull. They stepped outside into the corridor and talked for a couple of minutes in low 

tones, and then Dad came over and said to me &quot;Come on, sport. Lets go home.&quot; 

Mr. Gray looked at him. &quot;I&apos;ll try to warn you if I hear anything. Bill,&quot; he told my father. &quot;And Bill, if things go bad, I&apos; 11 take care 

of it&quot; 

&quot;Don&apos;t Jeff,&quot; my father said to him. &quot;Don&apos;tjam yourself up forme. We were never all that buddy-buddy back in the old days, 

you know.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 31 



&quot;It won&apos;t be for you/&apos; said Mr. Gray. &quot;It&apos;ll be forme, and for Shane, and for this great little town of Dundee, Washington. There 

are still a few of us who remember the old way, Bill, and there are still a few red lines. If they cross this one, then I&apos;m taking care 

of it.&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;d appreciate that,&quot; said my father. 

&quot;When you&apos; re ajet, you&apos; re ajet all the way,&quot; said the janitor. 

&quot;From your first cigarette, to your dying day,&quot; responded my father. By then I had my jacket on and we left In the car I asked 

him, &quot;When were you in ajet?&quot; 

&quot;When I was a very young man, Shane, before the Mexicans came and when our whole town was white people, our high school 

football team was called the Dundee Jets,&quot; said Dad. &quot;We were one tight and righteous crew. Oh, yeah.&quot; 

&quot;I guess they&apos;re going to kick me out of school because of what I did to Bobby, huh?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Son, I don&apos;t know for sure, but somehow I don&apos;t think so.&quot; 

&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Doctor Mandelbaum is a psychiatrist. He makes his living by evaluating the state of mind of other people,&quot; said Dad in a neutral 

voice. &quot;Whether or not you can go to school again depends on whether or not Doctor Mandelbaum is a good psychiatrist. On 

whether or not he can tell when a man means what he says, even a man whom he personally holds in pure contempt. It depends on 

whether Doctor Mandelbaum is capable of understanding that even for someone like himself, decisions can still on occasion have 

consequences.&quot; Then my father and I went home and he made me spaghetti-o&apos;s before he got drunk. 

My Mom came to my bedside that night I met Doctor Mandelbaum in the principal&apos; s office. She must have knocked back at least 

a whole half-gallon plastic jug of Jim Beam, because she was really soppy drunk, and that was rare for her. She was all over me, 

stroking my hair and crying, reeking of the booze. &quot;My poor little boy! What kind of world have we brought you into? My poor 

little brave boy ! &quot; I didn&apos; t understand it at the time, but even in her maudlin drunkenness Mom could not bring herself to call me 

her poor brave little white boy. Even when she was three sheets to the wind, the taboo against any mention of race, at least our 

own race, was overriding. &quot;Oh Shanie, Shanie, you mustn&apos;t ever be so brave again!&quot; she moaned. &quot;Because they look for brave 

little boys and they mark them forever, and one day they will destroy you. Please, Shanie, you must promise me, you won&apos;t ever 

try to be brave again. Y ou mustn&apos;t try and fight, Shanie, because they will destroy you in a thousand ways you can&apos;t understand. 

Y ou must learn to just be quiet and think your own thoughts, in silence, and in your silence be proud that you are among the 

last... Shanie, you mustn&apos;t ever be brave again. Promise Mommy you won&apos;t ever try to be brave again!&quot; I didn&apos;t say anything and 

after a while she passed out and fell onto tiie floor. 

But Dad was right. I stayed out of school the next day, a Friday, and the next Monday I took the bus to school and went to class 

like nothing had happened. From then on, Bobby Fernandez and the other bullies stayed the hell away from me. I never saw Rabbi 

J acob M andelbaum again or heard anything at all of him, until one morning during the war when he left his Tudor mansion on 

Bainbridge Island, got into his car, turned the ignition and got raptured. I recognized his name from the newspaper report. This 

was a dozen years after I broke bad at MLK Elementary; his rapture had nothing whatsoever to do with me and much to do with 

the fact that he was an arrogant Jewish asshole who had not only pissed off many, many people in the Northwest Homeland but 

who, for all his rabbinical training, did not recall enough Hebrew to read Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin when it was written on the 

wall in front of him. So how did my father save me from It Takes A Village? To this very day, I have no idea. I didn&apos;t understand 

what happened at the time and Dad and I never discussed it again. Mr. Gray, who knew, was long gone by the time I was ever in a 

position to come and ask him. 

Well, there went my only chance to get out of Lewis County, Washington and grow up in some rich liberal family of yuppies. 

Instead, I stayed in the land of my birth. The cold land, the hard land, the land where the winter was chill and wet and the jobs 

were scarce, where the woodchucks ate from tin cans in trailers and drank from rotgut forties of Rainier Ale and cursed the 

Mexicans who swarmed over us like fire ants and stripped us bare. The Northwest Homeland. My wallet was always hght, but 

when I came to manhood the gun in my hand was heavy and real and strong, and even with my pockets empty, I always stood tall 

and no enemy ever saw my back. W hatever you did for me on that afternoon so long ago . . . thanks, D ad. Y ou left me nothing but a 

man&apos; s burden to carry, but there are a hell of a lot worse legacies to leave a son. 

* * * 

Not that I escaped unscathed. By no means. At age eight, that whole episode went into my lifelong permanent record and never 
left me until we finally won the revolution. At my last job interview under the old ZOG system, when I was working temp in a 
warehouse but was looking for something that had at least some kind of rudimentary medical insurance, I was denied employment 
as a janitor in an office building, because in third grade I had displayed &quot;racist and anti-social tendencies&quot; and the poor middle- 
aged white woman who interviewed me was scared to hire me because she &quot;might get in trouble with the government.&quot; 
At least the Northwest Republic found me worthy to guard their cranberries. 

After the Bobby Fernandez contretemps in the third grade there isn&apos;t much to tell for a while, except our family kept on going 
downhill economically and socially and everything around us kept getting worse and worse. But there was one development I 
suppose I should mention, about me. Maybe it was that arrogant old fart Mandelbaum telling me I didn&apos;t need to know who 
Shakespeare was, maybe I was just so desperate to escape the crappy world and home life I was growing up in that I grabbed onto 
any straw, maybe because we couldn&apos; t afford a computer and the stuff on TV was such stupid banal crap that even as a child it 
bored me and repulsed me, but about that time of my life I really turned inward, so to speak. I discovered books. 

A Distant Thunder 32 



I discovered that it was possible to find things in books, to get things out of books, knowledge and images and thoughts that you 
never saw on TV. What happened was that I was in the library one day soon after the Fernandez thing, and for some reason I 
pulled out an ancient, crumbling copy of Booth Tarkington&apos; s Penrod, His Complete Story from the shelves and I started reading 
about a boy who grew up in Indiana before World War One. I saw a childhood that I understood might have been mine, and that 
later on I understood should have been mine. I took the form home that night and got Mom to sign it before she got too drunk, I 
got a library card, and the first book I checked out was Penrod so I could finish it I pretty much stopped talking to people and I 
started reading. Most kids my age who wanted to escape fled into the cyber- world where they could play games and blow up 
virtual monsters and lose themselves in unreality, but not me. I don&apos;t know why— who knows how these things work?— but 
television and computer games simply lost their appeal for me. All of a sudden I discovered my own unreality of escape in the 
world of books. The Rochambeau Memorial Library in Dundee had been founded in 1899 by a woman named Margarita 
Rochambeau who was the first editor of the Dundee Advertiser, evidently a very cultured lady who had made sure it was stocked 
with all the classics of the time, and thanks to a long succession of very dedicated librarians who took pride in their work and kept 
their stock in repair, so that many of those books were still around and still readable over a century later. There were several more 
Booth Tarkingtons in first editions, like Seventeen and Gentle Julia and The Magnificent Ambersons. From there it was straight to 
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, (this was before it was proscribed.) Then I got into Jules Verne and went around the moon, 
and then I read H. G . Wells&apos; First Men In The Moon and went all the way, and fought Martians in The War of the Worlds. I 
noticed that it was always the older fiction I liked, W ells and T arkington, V erne and A rthur C onan D oy le, the mysteries by J ohn 
Dickson Carr and Agatha Christie, the science fiction from the 1940s and 1950s. There is a now forgotten writer named Edison 
Marshall who made me a Viking, a Southern planter dancing cotillons in Charleston, a sailor on a Y ankee clipper ship, and an 
English peasant lad who fought his way up to become lord of the manor and marry milady as well. Thanks to George Shipway I 
sailed with Agamemnon against Troy, swung a sword in King Stephen&apos; s wars in medieval England and fought for the Raj on the 
searing plains of Punjab. There were some childrens&apos; books by a woman named Eleanor Cameron about kids making a space ship 
and flying off to the Mushroom Planet that I used to dream about, getting in a space ship and flying away from Dundee. These 
books took me back to a time when white men ruled the world and there was no political correctness, no Bobby Fernandezes 
wanting me to suck dick, and when people had jobs and homes and families where nobody got drunk all the time. 
I discovered that I liked non- fiction even more, and I was drawn irresistably to history. Not the fake history we were taught in 
school that was always about how great and wonderful women and Indians and Africans and Polynesians were, and how superior 
any non-white civilization was, and where white men never figured except as villains who always came along and killed off and 
exploited all the noble savages. I read all the older books I could find in the library, about ancient Rome, Charlemagne, the Middle 
Ages when knighthood was in flower, everything from the story of Gothic architecture to Zeppelins of World War One. By a 
process I still don&apos; t understand I became a history junkie, desperately thirsty for any knowledge of times past. Better times and 
places when everyone who mattered had my color skin. Anything about the Civil War thrilled me, on the Confederate side of 
course. I went through a brief and very silly period in fifth grade where I spoke with what I thought was a Southern accent and I 
told people I was really bom in Tennessee and adopted. But above all there were the books about the Fiihrer A dolf Hitler, 
National Socialism, and the Third Reich. I would have pretended to be a German if it hadn&apos;t been completely beyond me. I didn&apos;t 
dare draw a swastika anywhere it might be seen or traced back to me. I had that much sense anyway. But I used to find places to 
hide in the woods or sometimes in school, with a pencil and pieces of paper, and I&apos; d practice drawing swastika after swastika, and 
I&apos;d also draw SS runes and Confederate flags, and German soldiers and Klansmen in robes, and sometimes knights in armor, and 
of course the obligatory Vikings. I always made sure I tore all the drawings up and flushed them down the toilet or burned them 
after I had to go back out into the real world. 

I guess some people are simply bom out of step with their time, and I was one of those. I was coming to understand that things 
around me weren&apos;t ri^ht somehow, that this was not the way life is supposed to be. The books showed me what my hfe should 
have been like, in infinite variations. I became haunted, obsessed by a vision of a world very different than the one which I grew 
up in, an all-white world with very different standards and priorities. A world of strength and valor and glory, full of all the 
qualities and virtues and experiences which seemed to have vanished completely from the earth. I had an idealized view of the 
past, all white faces, of course, and all the more thrilling because I understood that this vision was forbidden and that if I were 
noticed reading too many books about European and Confederate and especially Third Reich topics, I would get into trouble 
again. I became a master hand at sneaking my library books to school and reading them when I should have been watching videos 
or working on the computer in class. I wanted to somehow bring the vision to life again, make the world as it once was, but I had 
no idea of what such a brave new world should be like in the future. But there was something out there. Something different. 
Something better. There had to be. I had to find it, or I knew at some point I would go mad and die. I had to find it! 
From third grade on, I started spending as much time as I could in the library, alongside all the winos and homeless that used to 
crowd in on winter days to keep warm, pretending to read the magazines. I found a study carrel hidden away at the back of one of 
the stacks, and I used to stay hunched over it reading until I had to go home. I leamed to tune out the ravings of the homeless 
lunatics in the library and my dmnken parents at home, and in the pages of books I would immerse myself in whole different 
worlds I never knew existed. W hat were homeless, ma&apos; am? Y ou&apos; re supposed to be a historian and you don&apos; t know? J ust what the 
name says. People with no homes. Why did they have no homes? Because they didn&apos;t have any money. I told you, everything was 
about money in them days. No money, you lived on the street or in the woods. No, I&apos; m not kidding. Swear to G od, ma&apos; am, it 
really happened. Whole families in those days sometimes lived in state parks in caves like Neanderthals. Y es, even children, 

A Distant Thunder 33 



although to be sure whenever the law found white children homeless they were usually kidnapped by It Takes A Village, unless 
the kid had some kind of serious medical problem and none of the rich yuppies wanted them. A lot of times It Takes A Village 
would do sweeps through the parks and the homeless jungles and grab up all the kids and... 

Why did America let children live in caves and the woods and below underpasses? I told you, they had no money. Ah... yes 
ma&apos; am, it was terrible and evil. Why else do you think we revolted? What did you think it was all about? That we fought and 
killed The Beast for something to do? I&apos;m sorry, that sounds mean and crotchety and I shouldn&apos; t talk to you like that. I know you 
don&apos; t understand, and that&apos; s how it should be. Y ou shouldn&apos; t have to understand such things. Y ou all right ma&apos; am? W e can start 
again tomorrow if you want. Y ou sure? 

The library was one of the few public places where there was heat that the homeless couldn&apos; t be run off from. They stank up the 
place and muttered to themselves and were sometimes drunk or doped, but they always shut up when the librarian Miss Haines 
shushed them, because they knew it was one of the few places in Dundee where they were safe from Leon Sorels and some of the 
other cops who beat them and set them on fire in order to encourage them to move on. There were thousands of homeless in those 
days, alcoholics and junkies a lot of them, true, but also alotof middle-aged white men who just couldn&apos;t get jobs. Once you got 
past forty-five or so in them days, you&apos; d better not lose your job, because most likely you&apos; d never work again. My Dad was a case 
in point. The only reason we never ended up homeless was that my Mom was a woman and she was always straight enough to 
hold down a job of some kind and one way or another we at least made the rent even if we had nothing but a can or two of beans 
in the cupboard. The local Chamber of Commerce types in the silk suits and Gucci shoes and hundred dollar haircuts who ran our 
town, like ten thousand others across the United States, didn&apos; t like having homeless everywhere. They were bad for business, one 
of ZOG &apos; s many dirty little secrets that had to be hidden away so as not to upset the beautiful people at play. 
That s how Dummy-Dummy Sorels got his first leg up as the establishment&apos; s chief head- knocker in our part of Lewis County. 
Sorels was a young Dundee cop at the time, a big muscleman with mighty bulging biceps and pecs and a tiny waist so he looked 
top-heavy and overbalanced. When the steroids he took made his hair thin our Sorels shaved his head, and I swear to God there 
was a kind of point on it. His skull looked almost pear-shaped and it was so noticeable he wore his hat all the time. We used to see 
Sorels beating on the homeless people on the street and making their faces bleed. But because the library was technically county 
and not city property. Miss Haines banned Sorels and told him if he came in and beat any of them she would call her friends in the 
ACLU and sue the department, and even Sorels had sense enough to be afraid of lawyers. Miss Haines didn&apos;t want the homeless 
people in there, not really, but she hated Sorels and I think she took a bit of pleasure in shielding them from him. She had been 
Leon Sorels&apos; teacher in elementary school, and I think it was her who told everybody his name back then had been Dummy- 
Dummy. He never forgot or forgave that. By the time of 10/22 Miss Haines was retired. Her house burned down one night and her 

body was found shot to death in the charred ruins. Sorels very loudly blamed the NV A for it, but we knew different. 

* * * 

I guess the next thing I should talk about is Dundee High School. When I entered DHS our family was in our last apartment we 
lived in before we finally sank below the last middle class social bar and went into the trailers. As to myself, I was a skinny geek 
with acne, my academic record was remarkable for its mediocrity, the possibility of college was so remote for anyone with my 
record of Fernandez -beating and homophobia that it never even figured into anything, and I was voted most likely to end up 
pumping gas. That pretty much says it all. But my high school experience wasn&apos;t about me. 

Somebody once said the Northwest War of Independence was a revolution won by pagan men and Christian women. That s a 
pretty big over- simplification. Actually, its a damned big over- simplification. But there&apos;s a goodly kernel of truth in it That 
pagan man/Christian woman combination could be very lethal to Zion, and I speak from experience. 
Her name was Rooney. 

I honestly can&apos;t remember when was the first time I noticed Rooney Wingfield in the corridors of Dundee High School. 
Washington used the old middle school system back then and so I went into Dundee High at the age of fourteen. The Wingfield 
kids had gone to West Harbor middle school and I went to Broad Street, so I didn&apos;t know her before then. By the middle of the 
ninth grade at DHS she was definitely on my radar screen. Rooney was one of those kids you knew by sight but you never seemed 
to know her name. She was this big, tall, gawky but strong girl with long hair who always wore homespun clothing that wasn&apos;t 
chic or fashionable. It was genuinely homespun, as in made at home by herself and her mother. Her ensemble always included 
ankle- length dresses so she looked like a Sixties hippie chick wearing a maxi-skirt, or else some kind of ghost from the nineteenth 
century. She marched up and down the corridors hke she was doing a power walk, and she would shoulder people out of her way 
if you didn&apos;t move fast enough. Somehow I learned by the kind of kid-osmosis grapevine that operates in school that she was a 
freak, her family were religious nuts and that was why she wore those funny long skirts, that they were trailer trash who worked as 
mechanics but it wasn&apos; t a good idea to mess with her because she&apos; d just as soon punch you in the face as look at you, and she also 
had two older brothers on the football team who were the size of oxen and who plowed through every defensive line in the state 
high school conference like tanks, and so bullying was high on the not recommended list, at least not until the brothers graduated. 
This much I knew about Rooney before she and I ever even so much as exchanged eye contact 
Mmm, this is going to take some explaining. 

Now, I was Rooney Wingfield&apos; s biggest fan in hfe. Still am. But even today I have to be honest. By no streteh of anyone&apos;s 
imagination could Rooney ever be called beautiful. We&apos; re talking Sarah Plain and Tall on her best day. But dammit her face was 
alive, expressive, if you can understand what I am saying, in a way that was true of no other girl in that school. Y ou looked in that 
homely face and there was life. There was a mind, not just an appetite. There was something there besides some ditz yearning to 

A Distant Thunder 34 



hit the mall with a credit card. Y ou&apos; d need to have been there to understand what completely brainless whores most white girls 
were. Y ou ever see a Madonna video from the old days? Well, that was what white girls wanted to be, Material Girls. What they 
mostly turned out to be was just junkie sluts who sold themselves to niggers and spies for drugs and money when they were 
young, and turned into evil castrating bitches who made their mens&apos; lives hell as they grew into adulthood. Not that us guys were 
any better, lest I be accused of misogyny. There was plenty of blame to go around for that whole crappy situation, believe me, and 
no one was exempt. A s far as white boys were concerned, white girls or for that matter girls of any color were just notches to be 
racked up on your dork and displayed hke trophies. The very idea of trying to talk to one on an intelligent basis as a fellow human 
being simply didn&apos; t figure into the white boy subculture of the time, and that&apos; s assuming that the white boys had anything 
intelligent to say, which we didn&apos;t. Total, complete materialism. Total, complete selfishness. Total, complete absence of anything 
like racial pride or respect for anyone of the opposite sex or even for oneself. Get it while you can, take it and run, and screw the 
whole rest of the world. If you were lucky you got to live life hke you saw on the DVDs for a while and then you died. 
Rooney was different. Y ou took one look at Rooney and you knew that behind that face she actually had a brain, and among white 
women that was rare indeed. Y ou have no idea how that fascinated me. 

She was tall, a good inch taller than me actually, and the maxi-skirts she always wore made her look even taller. I believe the 
cliche term would be raw-boned, and it wouldn&apos; t be too far off. But she was never fat. I&apos; ve mentioned this obesity business before; 
it started early. Because of that horrible junk food diet combined with mass Scandinavian immigration a century before, here in 
the Northwest we tended to get a lot of these Tugboat Annie types. Really tall and big-boned Norska- descended women, who 
would have looked really fine if they&apos; d spent their lives doing farm work like their foremothers, but now they were bloated and 
distorted out of shape by a lifetime of tacos and Toblerones, 150 pounds or more overweight with dangling dewlaps of fat on their 
upper arms, a mighty buffalo butt with thunder thighs and a blue-chinned five o&apos; clock shadow. A lot of these fat gals I recall 
actually had to shave, you know. Shave their faces and shave their backs. Some kind of weird hormone thing due to the rotten diet, 
maybe the climate, who the hell knows? But it was a fact. Rooney wasn&apos;t one of those. She never ballooned up to 300 pounds and 
became a La Gorda and that was one reason you just kind of knew she was from somewhere else. (South Carolina, actually.) 
Rooney wasn&apos;t petite by any means. She was a big girl with broad strong shoulders, but she was nobly- built She damned sure 
never had to shave, and being in a position to know I can tell you she never had to shave her back, either. She was a big, tall, 
strong woman and by God she was all woman. She was stacked hke a seam of grapes with a body any Valkyrie would envy. Her 
best feature was her hair. It was long, down to her shoulders when we first met and later on it was down to her waist. Not exactly 
blond, not exactly red, not exactly brown. I suppose honey might do in a pinch, but it wasn&apos;t exactly that either. Whatever it was, 
it was soft and rippling like a running river. Y ou wanted to drown in it. 
Wait. I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. I&apos;d better tell how Rooney and I met. 

The town square in Dundee was, and still is, very large and green, all very Norman Rockwell- ish, anchored on one side by the 
library and with this neat big white- painted gazebo, park benches, so forth and so on. In the center was the monument to our 
town&apos; s famous shootout on Christmas Day of 1889, when the town marshah Frenchy Delacroix was kihed in a big gunfight with 
LaughingJackCulhane&apos;s gang, all very Gary Cooper- ish. The first and the last time anything interesting ever happened in 
Dundee, Washington, at least until us evildoers came along. Since even the worst students at one point or another were forced to 
use the library, the square became a minor hangout, at least during the months when the weather was nice. 
I was going into the library one cold and clear Sunday afternoon just before Christmas break to try and find a book for a report on 
Native American Culture. That&apos;s Indians. Politically Correct Washington was always big on Indians. Noble savages, my ass. At 
the time Indians ran all the casinos and it seemed every twenty miles there was some little &quot;tribe&quot; with a fifty-acre &quot;reservation&quot; 
just big enough to build a casino on so Joe Blow could come in and gamble away his children&apos;s cohege money in a single evening. 
I have a certain amount of time for the Comanche and Lakota and Abenaki and even the Pueblo- builders. They were interesting 
people even if they weren&apos;t white, and fair enough, the Aztecs and Mayas could build in stone and they had some spot- on 
calendars even if they did cut people&apos;s hearts out as sacrifices to their gods, and the Mayas used to have these sacred wells where 
they&apos; d tie up young girls after the Maya priests raped them and drop them in to drown. They also raised chihuahuas like we raise 
chickens, for food. Eating dog isn&apos; t something I&apos;d care to do, but it is a break from the humdrum. But our Northwest tribes were 
just crappy little nobodies who never cut anybody&apos; s hearts out, except for up in A laska there was some tribes who were cannibals. 
They made interesting totem poles, though. 
I&apos;m sorry, ma&apos;am, I&apos;m doing it again. Right. Rooney. 

On that Sunday afternoon in January of my tenth grade year, I was going into the library when I looked over towards the gazebo 
and I saw a gaggle of so-called popular girls from Dundee High and their dumb- ass jock boyfriends mihing around, at the center 
of which was Bo Decker, our prize negro and damned near our only negro. Bo was the bakketbawl star. No, not basketball. 
Bakketbawl. The ultimate nigger game. We don&apos;t play it any more here in the Repubhc because somebody finally figured out it 
doesn&apos; t take any particular athletic ability besides being able to bounce a ball up and down on a wooden floor and jump and swing 
from the hoop like a monkey and gibber about how Ah Gots More Moves Than Ex-Lax. It doesn&apos;t even make you run any great 
distances like baseball and football do. We still play baseball because it requires teamwork and hand-eye coordination and 
disciplined upper body strength, and we still play football because it requires the combined use of strength and strategy and 
endurance, a good military training game. We still play hockey for the speed and the stick- fighting, rugby for the contact, and for 
the past fifty years we have been at war with every hurling team in Ireland&apos; s G aelic A thletic A ssociation and every footie team in 
Australia. Basketball is a game for tall, skinny monkeys and is probably the most boring thing on the face of the earth to watch, 

A Distant Thunder 35 



coming in just after watching paint dry. But we all worshipped bakketbawl back in those days to a point that seems completely 

insane today. Why? Because it was the one and only thing on this earth, from that day until this, that blacks have ever been able to 

do better than whites, and so the media hyped it to a religion. A cult of nigger-worship. 

Anyway, Bo Decker was Dundee High&apos;s bakketbawl star. Being our school&apos;s Official Blackfella With the Ball, he also had his 

official white girl friend. The head cheerleader, needless to say, a long leggy California-style blonde Valley Girl with a tan named 

Jill M alloy. It still pisses me off that slut had an Irish name. Her father was vice president of one of the local banks and ran a real 

estate development company on the side with interests in all the local shopping malls and those damned Indian casinos. Village 

upper-crud of ZOG. Plenty of money and zero of anything else, including any sense of human decency. 

Whatthehelldoyou think happened to her, ma&apos;am? After the Longview treaty she was put on the List by more than one of us 

who remembered. During the Cleanup Jill M alloy was tracked down by Force 101, she was tried for racial treason and convicted, 

and she was hanged. 

Anyway, I heard the ruckus and so I wandered over and I infiltrated the little crowd of high school kids, all of whom were 

watching the central drama, and none of whom took any notice of me whatsoever. I was after all only Shane the trailer trash geek, 

that yutz who&apos; d gone nuts and attacked Bobby Fernandez back in third grade (everybody remembered that) but who hadn&apos; t done 

anything of note since, and who was by now pretty much consigned to perpetual nonentity. I saw that the crux of the matter before 

the gazebo was thatjill the cheerleader was having a shouting, screaming, knock- down- drag- out with that weird girl in the long 

skirts I&apos;d seen around school for about a year and whom I&apos; d always had this hankering to meet. Those long skirts just seemed kind 

of sexy somehow. Everyone was yelling, but I could tell the weirdo girl was outnumbered and thatjill and her little clique of SUV 

Barbie dolls and the Barbie dolls&apos; dumb- ass Kens are all piling on her, working themselves up to break bad, and things are getting 

pretty strident J ill was yelling at Rooney, &quot;Racist bitch! Y ou say you&apos; re a Christian, but G od made black men as well as white 

men! &quot; 

&quot;God also made goats!&quot; yelled back Rooney in exasperated fury. &quot;That don&apos;t mean you got to fuck one!&quot; 

&quot;Oh, dat&apos;s it, you redneck cracker ho&apos;!&quot; bellowed big nigger Bo in a fit of rage. He raised his huge black fist like a hammer to 

slam it down on Rooney&apos; s head. It would have done a lot of damage if he&apos; d connected. We&apos; re talking a big buck here. King Kong 

with steroid muscles. 

Now, if this babble of mine properly followed assorted heroic tales of revolutionary derring-do that some of my, uh, former 

comrades have published in their memoirs subsequent to those times, or even an NBA movie script, here is where I should have 

gone for the nigger, called him out with a speech full of National Socialist or else Christian Identity fervor depending in who was 

telling the story, then fought an epic hand-to-hand combat and emerged triumphant with my foot on his monkoid chest before 

carrying the Aryan maiden off to some secluded bower for a night of passion or maybe reading Bible verses, again depending on 

who&apos; s doing the telling. But things didn&apos;t work like that in real life. I was still in the stunned and gaping mode that white people 

went into back then whenever they actually saw a white person standing up to Political Correctness, especially in a loud and 

public way. It didn&apos;t compute. White people didn&apos;t act hke that. They weren&apos;t supposed to, anyway. When a black man raised his 

hand to strike, white people were supposed to fall to their knees and cringe and thump their tails between their legs and piss on the 

ground. 

But as it happened, Rooney didn&apos;t need any help. She just turned to Bo in irritation and snarled at him, &quot;Hey, monkey meat, if I 

want to hear from you I&apos; 11 pull your chain! &quot; Then she ignored him and went back to cussing J ill something fierce, reading her the 

riot act with Biblical chapter and verse. To her the monkoid wasn&apos;t even there; the white slut was the real problem. Which was of 

course the case. Even at age fifteen, the girl had an ideological grasp of the essentials. I didn&apos;t hear what she was saying. I was 

watching Bo of the Bubble Lip, measuring how long a leap it would take me to be on him if he hit her. I knew I couldn&apos;t beat him 

in a fight and I didn&apos;t have a concrete block, so I pulled out my Swiss army knife and opened it surreptitiously against my body. I 

figured I&apos;d try to stick it through the nigger&apos; s eye into his brain, but it wasn&apos;t necessary. Big bad-ass Bo hesitated, and then he kind 

of shrank, then he suddenly said to Jill &quot;Fuck this!&quot; and then he dragged her away by force across the square and tossed her into 

his big shiny new SUV . That was the signal. Showtime was over. The entourage having lost their Baron Samedi, they muttered 

and babbled and faded away like zombies melting down into the earth at cockcrow. Within a minute that square was empty except 

for me and Rooney. The show was over once Big Nig was gone. Michael Jordan has left the building. 

Instinctively, without even the words to explain it to myself, I understood what had happened. A black man had met a white 

person who was not afraid of him. A white person he couldn&apos;t Mau Mau. Gender didn&apos;t matter. A black meets a real white man or 

woman, he understands Ole Massa or in this case De Missy is back. He folds. That&apos; s the way it works. Have you ever noticed that 

an animal can never look a man in the eye? That was Rooney W ingfield. She whupped that buck&apos; s ass without raising a finger or 

even raising her voice. She sent him slinking off the court like a whipped dog through the sheer strength of her mighty spirit. Oh, 

yeah. That was Rooney. Always. 

I looked at the weirdo girl with the long skirt. She was flushed red and shaking and brushing back her beautiful, beautiful hair with 

her fluttering fingers. I picked up on something. &quot;Y ou were scared,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Of course I was,&quot; she said matter-of-factly. &quot;Mobs tend to have that effect on a person. Y ou ever get twenty of them blasphemers 

around you trying to work themselves up to attack, you&apos; 11 be scared, too.&quot; 

&quot;God, you&apos; re a hell of a woman!&quot; I told her, with every ounce of admiration in whatever soul a fifteen year-old can have. 

She looked at me, unsmiling. &quot;And you&apos;re a hell of man,&quot; she said. 

A Distant Thunder 36 



&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked, genuinely puzzled. &quot;I didn&apos;t do anything.&quot; Without thinking I folded the knife and put it back in 

my pocket and she saw it. 

&quot;Y es, you did/&apos; said Rooney. &quot;Y ou&apos; re a white male, right?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, last time I took off my underwear and checked, yeah/&apos; I said. 

&quot;A nd when you saw there was trouble, racial trouble with yelling and screaming, you didn&apos; t run away, &quot; she said. &quot; Y ou didn&apos; t look 

the other way and whistle a bit and walk into the library pretending you didn&apos; t see or hear anything. Like I saw four other white 

guys from Dundee High School do, all the while that whole stupid mess was going on just now. Instead, you came towards me. 

Y ou came over here. Y ou marched to the sound of the guns. That&apos; s what white men do. The old kind, anyway. I guess you&apos; re one 

of the old kind.&quot; 

&quot;I didn&apos;t see a gun,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Never mind, that&apos;s just an old saying. I&apos;m Rooney Wingfield. Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;r m Shane Ryan,&quot; I rephed. Then she leaned over and kissed me. Full on the lips. Calmly, firmly. Not just a peck, and not a 

whore&apos;s tongue-slurp either. A real man&apos;s reward kiss from a real woman, acknowledging the sexual element but not making a big 

deal about it An &quot;all right, you&apos;ve got my attention, laddie, and who knows, play your cards right and maybe some day you&apos;ll get 

some of this&quot; kiss. She looked into my eyes. Hers were green. She said &quot;Thanks for coming for me, Shane Ryan.&quot; She turned and 

she walked away, her hair and that long dress billowing. I stood there rooted to the spot I couldn&apos;t follow her, however much I 

wanted to. I had been struck by a thunderbolt I think I stood there for another ten minutes before I could even move. 

I went home and I just savored the whole experience, which was more or less the only one I had ever had unless you counted my 

incredibly clumsy attempt bD kiss Cynthia McCullock under the bleachers when I was thirteen, which we won&apos;t get inbD. I was 

over the moon for about a week. I wanted bD go up to her in school and start something between us, but I honestly had no idea how 

to go about it Other than the one disaster with Cynthia I&apos;d never had anything to do with girls before. Never had the chance, since 

I was trailer trash and I had no money and no car, and all white girls in them days wanted was material things which I didn&apos;t have 

and couldn&apos;t get without selling drugs. I had come to understand what most poor white boys in the United States who didn&apos;t look 

movie- star handsome came to understand in junior high, and that is that lacking money, lacking movie- start good looks, or lacking 

a ready supply of pharmaceuticals we would most likely never find a mate of our own race. It was just something we accepted. If 

we were lucky, some day we might have enough money to bring in a mail order bride from Hong Kong who would stay with us 

for the required two years before she accused us of beating her and fled with her green card. I accepted that and from what I saw 

of the white girls in Dundee Middle School and Dundee High I didn&apos;t really care. None of them seemed worth a shit in any case. 

What had happened that Sunday afternoon seemed to be something completely unique, almost like I had seen a flying saucer land 

on the town square and aliens descend bD check out a library book. I desperately wanted to follow up on it but I was completely at 

sea and terrified that it was a once- off thing and I&apos; d blow it I didn&apos; t know what b) do, and there was no one around b) tell me, 

since Dad was pretty much at rock bottom now, unemployed for two years and lying drunk 24/7, and my brothers were both in the 

army. The thought of talking to Mom about a girl simply never occurred to me, even when she was sober. I mean, it wasn&apos;t like 

she was an actual woman, she was my Mom. 

Then one night in January, about six o&apos; clock in the evening, I was walking home from a shitjob I had at the time, pushing a broom 

and cleaning the grease trap at the Burger Doodle on Harrison Avenue. I gave most of my pay b) Dad for booze, because I knew if 

he didn&apos; t buy rotgut vodka in the liquor store then he&apos; d end up drinking Stemo or paint thinner or something worse, and I kind of 

figured I owed him for the Bobby Fernandez thing. I had the job through the Student Work Program at Vocational Ed class at 

school. This was a program run through the Washington state public schools b) give local businesses access to teenaged labor at 

below minimum wage, for which the school system got a kickback. Or somebody got a kickback, anyway. To be fair, it was just 

about the only way poor white kids could compete with the Mexicans and get any work experience at all. I hoped to graduate to 

actually flipping the burgers alongside the Mexicans once I turned sixteen, if I could get my Spanish grades up and if I could 

persuade the boss to keep me on, and if that happened I&apos;d actually go up to minimum wage. (He wanted to hire me on 

permanently, because I always showed up on time and I was sober and straight but the head office in Seattle let me go and got 

another fifteen year- old from the high school to work another year at four dollars an hour.) 

It was winter, already dark, and a light cold Northwest half- rain was hanging in the air. A pickup truck pulled up beside me as I 

trudged up First Street towards the bus stop that would take me back to the trailer park. To my left I heard this hard Southern 

voice say to me &quot;Reckon you&apos; d be Shane Ryan.&quot; I looked over. The pickup&apos; s driver had his overhead light on, and I saw a kind of 

skinny, hard-looking middle-aged Elvis face with swept back hair leaning over and looking at me through the passenger side 

window of the truck. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. &quot;Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;Name&apos; s Carter Wingfield. I&apos;m Rooney&apos; s father. My daughter tells me you like to march to the sound of the guns, Shane.&quot; 

&quot;When I can hear &apos;em,&quot; I said with a shrug. That sounded very clever, but actually it meant nothing. It was just a snappy answer 

that occurred to me. I was nothing but a punk kid and I didn&apos; t think anything of it but it passed muster. 

CarterWingfieldopened the door of the pickup truck. &quot;Get in,&quot; he said. I thought quickly. I realized thati had nothing better to 

do. Not then, most likely not ever, so far as I could see. So what the hell? I got in. 

* * * 

The kids at school called the W ingfields trailer trash, but they didn&apos; t live in a trailer. In the dark of that winter night so long ago. 
Carter Wingfield pulled up outside a large ramshackle house on the edge of town. It was one of those two-story 1920s fixer- 

A Distant Thunder 37 



uppers like my own family lived in until fifth grade, although Carter and the boys hadn&apos;t done much fixing up, at least on the 
outside. Oh, they&apos;d done everything that counted, re-wired the place and fixed the roof and put in all new plumbing, but from the 
street I have to admit the place looked pretty seedy, complete with motor vehicles in various stages of disassembly in the yard, and 
of course there were the obhgatory dogs. Two, to be precise, a big Doberman Pinscher bitch with the odd name of Caprice, and a 
weird beagle- labrador looking beast called Porterfoy. That first night Caprice came over from the porch as I got out of the truck 
and gave me a good sniff all over. I guess she liked what she smelled, because after that I was in with the in crowd as far as she 
was concerned. Which was a good thing, because when Caprice put her mind to it her bite was much worse than her bark, as some 
white and black crackheads from Olympia found out one day when they tried to break into the Wingfield&apos; s bam in the back and 
steal auto parts. Caprice literally tore the arm off one of those poor bastards and then Porterfoy tried to tear out and eat their guts. 
But that night Porterfoy was lying on the floor in front of the radiator just inside the door, and he just ignored me. Porterfoy was a 
coon- hunting dog from South Carolina. And I do mean coon dog. Remind me to tell you that story when we get to my telling you 
about after 10/22 and the revolt 

When I arrived at the Wingfield house that night I had no idea what to expect. I walked into the living room, where two big look- 
alike guys with reddish buzz cuts whom I recognized from school as Rooney&apos;s elder brothers were sitting on battered plastic 
upholstered armchairs sipping from plastic jugs of diet soda and watching TV. I noticed there were some pictures on the wall and 
also a big flag, like the French or Italian or Irish flags, in three colored vertical bands, blue and white and green. &quot;This is Shane,&quot; 
Carter told them by way of introduction. &quot;He&apos; s the young man who didn&apos;t walk away on Rooney the other day. Shane, these are 
my twin boys, John Hunt Wingfield and John Bell Wingfield. Reckon you&apos;ve seen &apos;em on the football field.&quot; 
&quot;Y eah, I have,&quot; I replied. I hadn&apos;t, actually, because I never bothered to go to football games. Like there was anything going on at 
Dundee High School, sports or anything else, that mattered a single flying fornication to me? But it didn&apos;t seem politic to mention 
that &quot;Hi, guys. Uh, you&apos;re both named John?&quot; 

&quot;We&apos; re named after two of the greatest generals during the war,&quot; said one of them, not even looking at me. &quot;I&apos;m John Hunt 
Morgan Wingfield and he&apos;s John Bell Hood Wingfield.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; I said, and here my voluminous Confederate reading down through the years stood me in good stead. &quot;John Hunt 
Morgan, former slave trader out of Kentucky, either the second best or third best cavalry commander in the Confederate army, 
depending on how big a fan you are of Jeb Stuart. Everybody pretty much agrees that Nathan Bedford Forrest was number one.&quot; 
&quot;Including Robert E. Lee,&quot; rephed John Hunt &quot;He told some reporter after the war that Forrest was the best the South had.&quot; 
&quot;There was Scott Mosby,&quot; put in Carter. 

&quot; M osby doesn&apos; t count &quot; I said without thinking. &quot; He turned carpetbagger after the war. He wouldn&apos; t back the K Ian and he 
wouldn&apos;t help the South resist Reconstruction.&quot; 

&quot;So I&apos;ve heard,&quot; said Rooney&apos; s dad with a chuckle. I didn&apos; t know it but I had passed another test People who could conduct an 
informed discussion on obscure issues of Confederate history were in short supply in Dundee. Or anywhere else, for that matter. 
&quot;John Bell Hood has gotten a bad historical rep because of Franklin and because he lost Atlanta, but he did what he could with 
what he had to work with, and his men always swore by him,&quot; I went on. 

&quot;He led from the front&quot; said John Bell. &quot;Okay, being a general and all, maybe he should have got up on the hill behind the lines 
and taken a look at what was going on with the big picture every now and then. Sometimes you can&apos; t see or understand everything 
that s going on from right down in front not if you&apos; re a general, but he felt so for his men that he couldn&apos; t bear to send them to 
their death unless he himself was right there at their head. He was a man of the greatest personal honor and courage, and I got no 
problem carrying his name.&quot; 

&quot;Reckon the girls are in the kitchen,&quot; said Carter, leading me on through. I learned that Carter and the boys had knocked out the 
dry wall to the dining room to make the kitchen much bigger, because to their way of thinking the kitchen was the most important 
room in the house, the heart of the home so to speak. Rooney and a younger girl were there, doing their homework on the table. 
&quot;Hi, Shane,&quot; Rooney said as I walked in. Just that She didn&apos;t even look up. It was as if we&apos; d never kissed. It was like we&apos; d known 
one another all our lives and me walking into her kitchen was totally normal, and somehow to me that was even better than some 
kind of flirtation would have been. A small birdlike woman in blue jeans was standing at the kitchen stove stirring huge pots of 
bubbling stuff. (Married women could wear pants in the Wingfields&apos; interpretation of the Bible.) She looked like a medieval 
alchemist seeking the Philosopher&apos;s Stone. &quot;This is Shane,&quot; said Carter to his wife. &quot;Shane, this is my wife, Racine.&quot; 
&quot;Please to meet you, Mrs. Wingfield,&quot; I said. The thought hit me that when I was ten years old and faking my ridiculous child&apos; s 
Southern accent because I so badly wanted to be anyone on earth but who I was and anywhere else but Dundee, Washington, these 
people had been living it for real. 

&quot;You&apos;re the boy who didn&apos;t turn away from my child. We&apos;re all much obliged, Shane,&quot; said Ma, wrestling with something in one 
of the pots. She looked over at me. &quot;Y ou need some feeding up, Shane. Don&apos;tyour Mama feed you?&quot; I just shrugged. My Mama 
didn&apos; t actually feed me much at all, but it wouldn&apos; t have been respectful for me to say anything, so I didn&apos; t and that won me a 
point or two with Ma Wingfield, who needless to say already knew my whole story before I set foot in her house. My Mom might 
have been a brown-bag lush, but for me to say so would have been wrong. I didn&apos;t and they respected that Completely 
unbeknownst to me, I was making all the right moves. Carter pointed at the girl across the table from Rooney. &quot;That s our 
youngest girl, China,&quot; said Carter &quot;She&apos;s in seventh grade. We got another boy, Adam, he&apos;s oureldest Justgotoutof the army a 
few months back. They chucked him out early for not being sufficiently diverse. He had to finish a re- bore down at the shop but 
he&apos;ll be in directly.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 38 



&quot;Hey, Shane/&apos; said China, looking up at me. She was a demure- looking little girl with darker honey blonde than Rooney. She 
wore a white blouse with hand-sewn lace and the same long skirt as her older sister. Her eyes were brown, and a she was a bit shy. 
&quot;Hey,&quot; I said to China. First word I ever spoke to her. The Wingfields had a quirk, what they called among themselves the long 
and the short of it. They were either undersized or oversized, no in between. Carter, Ma, and China were the short of it, small and 
strong and wiry and all muscle. Rooney, John Hunt, John Bell, and Adam were the long of it, tall and broad-shouldered and all 
muscle. I should mention that as big as John Bell and John Hunt were, Adam could lift both of them, one in each hand. They 
called him Hoss. Wonder why? Adam came in a bit later, reeking of grease and sweat, and when he had showered and changed we 
sat down to eat. The house shook when Adam sat down in his seat. I learned later that in the army he had been rejected for both 
armor and the paratroops because he was too big to fit into a tank and they were worried the standard military parachute wouldn&apos;t 
carry him. He was the only man I ever knew who really needed to drive one of those big huge SUVs the auto industry peddled. 
Carter offered grace. &quot;Lord, we thank Thee for what we are about to receive and we thank Thee for helping our family walk in 
Thy ways. W e also thank Thee for Shane Ryan who didn&apos; t walk away from his sister in her time of need, present among us 
tonight to share Thy bounty. Now let&apos;s chomp.&quot; 

Supper that night consisted of pretty much what it always was around the Wingfields&apos; house: plain food, deliciously cooked, and 
mountains of it heaped high on platters. Enough to feed a small army with leftovers that then went into everyone&apos; s lunch boxes or 
into the fridge which was liable to open raiding at any hour by anyone who had invite into the Wingfield home, which as you will 
hear included by no means just me, but a wide cast of characters indeed. Ma would get seriously offended if various sealed plastic 
dishes of vittles didn&apos;t disappear from her refrigerator after a few days. Sometimes I would be out in the yard helping the boys 
with something or in the schoolroom in the bam, and I would hear her yelling &quot;Is there something wrong with this turkey 
mulligan?&quot; (Or this lasagna or this meat loaf or this tuna casserole or this Brunswick stew.) 
&quot;No, Ma,&quot; someone would shout back. 

&quot;Then why in tarnation is it still sitting here in the ice box taking up space?&quot; she&apos;d rant. &quot;Are every single one of you jackanapes 
too lazy to heat up a pot on the stove? Then just chuck the whole bowl in the domed microwave! What do you think we got it 
for?&quot; 

That first evening at the Wingfields&apos; I caught a break. It was pork chop night, and Ma Wingfield&apos; s pork chops were an offering fit 
for the gods, sliced thick, breaded and spiced with black pepper and fried just a little bit crisp on the outside yet still moist and 
tender at the center. How she got them like that was her secret. Other than her, Rooney, and China, I never knew anyone who 
could make pork chops hke that. There were two monster wooden bowls of green salad with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, 
anchovies, diced cheddar cheese and cmets of ranch and Italian and French dressing you could help yourself to. There were no 
separate salad bowls. Once grace was finished you just went at it. Y ou dug into whatever you wanted, in the full awareness that no 
one was passing judgment on how much or what you ate, and there would be enough for everyone and to spare. Y ou heaped the 
salad onto your plate along with the chops and the rice and gravy. Oh, yeah. Ma had that one ability that only certain Southem 
women seem to have, of making rice that doesn&apos;t stick together into a kind of mush. Rice where you can actually feel each grain 
as it goes down your throat. Rooney and China both leamed that from her as well. In addition there were com bread muffins that 
tasted almost as sweet as honey buns but which the Wingfield women always swore to me never had a drop of either sugar or 
honey in them. There was a big crock of bacon- baked beans which of itself could have fed a platoon, there were huge steaming 
plates of com on the cob with tubs of actual butter, and to top it all off there was pumpkin pie piled high with whipped cream. Not 
one hint of low- fat anything, not a grain of granola or a tad of tofu. A tme feat of culinary political incorrectness. 
I should also mention something which, in my opinion, places Racine Wingfield and her daughters head and shoulders above 
every chef, cook, or housewife of the Southem school of cuisine, of any generation. Southem cooking has always had one serious 
weakness, but it was one the Wingfield girls recognized and corrected. Unique among Southem cooks, past or present, Racine 
actually knew what garlic was. She used it in fifty different ways, from thin slices in the salad to the breading of her pork chops 
and her fried chicken. (That chicken was a gastronomic experience to which I am incapable of doing justice, and so I won&apos;t even 
try.) Do you have any idea how good Southem cooking can be once you throw in some garlic? 

This kind of abundance was a new experience for me. Groceries were always a secondary expense at our house (very secondary) 
and consisted mostly of fast food takeouts which I usually had to go get myself with whatever money Mom had left in her purse or 
Dad in his wallet, or else supper was an inedible mess out of cans that Mom or Dad would scorch in a saucepan or a skillet in the 
belief that this constituted cooking, which pots and pans aforesaid would then lie in the sink for three weeks until somebody, 
usually me, mustered enough energy to do a wash with a steel wool scouring pad and some detergent (Our last washing machine 
went when I was ten.) I had never experienced anything like this, but all of a sudden about halfway through the meal I realized 
that I had actually been hungry in the literal, physical sense for most of my hfe and that it was possible to put an end to this 
condition, at least for a while. The huge meal was washed down with large clear glasses of tea and cola with ice, which I found 
odd in the middle of winter. &quot;Southem people put ice in all their drinks, even in wintertime,&quot; explained Rooney when I asked. 
&quot;If s a habit we brought with us from the old country.&quot; 

I noticed something else that, to me, was odd. No one was drinking alcohol, not even beer. I had never been in a non-alcoholic 
home before. In fact, I had been in very few homes of any kind other than mine before. My folks weren&apos;t exactly the sociable kind 
and down on Dead Dog Road we didn&apos;t get many invitations to fashionable country club soirees. Although I knew intellectually 
that individuals and whole families existed who lived without booze, still it was a bit of a shock actually to run into one. Here was 

A Distant Thunder 39 



a whole group of people who didn&apos; t get drunk every night. How was such a thing possible? How did they triumph over the horror 
of the world we lived in without that whole- grain crutch? 

In order to save time, I&apos; 11 go ahead and run down what I eventually learned about the family. They arrived in Washington from 
South Carolina, but Carter Wingfield was originally from Florida. A Ithough I didn&apos; t know it at the time, Florida rednecks are 
considered to be just about the best of the breed. In that same interview where General Robert E. Lee was once asked by a reporter 
who in his opinion had been South&apos; s best general and he named Forrest, he was also asked who had been the toughest, hardiest, 
and most dangerous troops the Confederacy had, and Lee replied, &quot;The men from Florida,&quot; which surprised me as I might add it 
has surprised generations of chagrined Texans. 

Carter Wingfield was bom in a place called Mariana, on the Florida panhandle near the Alabama state line. In March of 1865 a 
large American force comprised of many thousands of blue- coated negro freedmen troops of the United States Army marched 
inland from the newly captured city of Pensacola. Mariana had no military value. When the Federals came Mariana had nothing at 
all. All the blacks had run away, and the women were doing almost all of the work in the home and in the fields. The town was 
destitute and barren of any man between fifteen and fifty, all of whom were in what was left of the Confederate army scattered 
from Virginia to the banks of the Mississippi. There was no seed for planting, there was no com for bread, there was no money, no 
medicine, no nothing. There wasn&apos;t even a single healthy horse or mule left in town; the local people had to mn physically from 
home to home and farm to farm to sound the alarm that the Y ankees were coming. But sound the alarm they did, and when the 
blacks in blue marched into Mariana they were met with barricaded streets and they found themselves looking down the barrel of 
every Southem rifle and shotgun remaining in the district. Every white male in the area who could make it had come with some 
kind of gun, even if he had no ammunition. There were almost two hundred rebels, teenaged boys and elderly men. The only 
exceptions were a few wounded Confederate soldiers who were home on leave. The youngest of the town&apos;s Confederate defenders 
was eleven years old. The oldest was eighty-one, a veteran who fought under A ndrew J ackson at the battle of New Orleans. From 
this the defenders of Mariana, Florida gained the name &quot;The Cradle and The Grave&quot;. They were commanded by a Major Armitage 
who did so from a chair, because he&apos;d caught a cannon ball at Gettysburg and both his legs had been amputated above the knee. 
With nothing at all to fight with, outnumbered almost ten to one, the people of Mariana still held off the Americans for tvjo days, 
fighting house to house until all but eighteen of them were dead or dying and the whole town was bumed to the ground. Armitage 
died in his chair on the porch of his burning home, the boards around him littered with empty pistols and rifles and on the street 
before him a mound of blue-clad negro corpses. This was the Wingfield family&apos;s heritage. 

I know that Carter did some time in prison as a young man, and he had some tattoos that even then I recognized as home-made 
prison tats. This included one on the fleshy part of his right hand between his thumb and forefinger, with a diamond and the letters 
AB, which I leamed stood for Aryan Brotherhood. I never asked Carter about his prison time and he never volunteered any 
information, with one possible exception when he once told me, &quot;Y ou ever feel like you just have to commit a crime, Shane, kill 
somebody. Don&apos;t steal. Stealing from poor people like ourselves is disgraceful, and stealing from the rich is too dangerous. In this 
world the god Mammon reigns right alongside the god Judah. Money is power, and The Beast is jealous of its power. The Beast 
doesn&apos; t really care about killing so long as you don&apos; t kill any of its own pets or servants, but if you try to lay your hands on 
money, the very source of its power. The Beast will cmsh you.&quot; 

Whatever the prison beef had been, when it was over Carter and Ma and the family moved up to the South Carolina Low Country 
to be near her people for a while. At some point along the line, I never knew exactly when or how, the Wingfields had come 
across Commander Rockwell&apos; s White Power, and it had taken immediate place after the Bible as the second Book in their lives. 
Right on the heels of that they had bought their first personal computer and discovered the Northwest Migration movement on the 
intemet, and with their Biblical orientation it seemed right and proper that like the children of Israel they should go forth into the 
wildemess seeking the Promised Land. They headed for Idaho, but when they got to Hayden Lake one of the Christian Identity 
pastors there convinced them that they would do better acting as missionaries in a new and untried province, so to speak. He 
persuaded Carter that westem Washington was the place they needed to settle. Maybe that pastor honestly thought that, and then 
again maybe he decided he didn&apos;t want any competition from more alpha males in his congregation. 

Whatever the reason, the Wingfields arrived in Dundee with one ancient Oldsmobile, one pickup tmck, a Ryder van containing all 
their worldly goods and very few dollars in their pockets. As you may have gathered, the economy wasn&apos;t too hot in the 
Northwest back then. Hell, the economy was bad everywhere. It never really recovered after September 11*, 2001. It was rough at 
first for thern, lite it was for mar^^ new Northwest settlers, but at least the Wingfields had a trade. Ma could cook short order at a 
diner with the same expertise she gave her own famUy, and the men were demon mechanics on ar^^ kind of engine. When the 
Wingfields first arrived in Dundee, Carter went the rounds of the local garages and truck lines looking for work He was 
invariably asted by the hiring manager, who for some reason alwe^s seemed to be female (that was a standard ZOG social 
engineering practice, as part of the policy of humiliating the whitB male) &quot;Uh, Mr Wingfield, no offense but you sound kind of, 
ah Southern, and we got a memo from the home office in Seattle that we&apos; re supposed to be careful about hiring new people who 
don&apos; t have a, ah local track record Y ou&apos; re not one of these out of state racists who are moving into the Northwest from all over 
the country, are you?&quot; 

&quot;No, no, not at all, child!&quot; Carter chirped with a big Elvis grin on his face. &quot;I just love niggers to death!&quot; Needless to say, no 
gainful employment there. After a few days of this. Carter drove out to the nearest truck stop on 1-5 and asked around in the coffee 
shop to see who was having some trouble. He fixed an electrical problem on a trucker&apos; s rig for fifty dollars, which the trucker was 
glad to pay out of his own pocket, since taking the vehicle into his line&apos; s shop in Fresno would cost him at least a week off the 

A Distant Thunder 40 



road, plus the Mexican and Chinese mechanics would probably have screwed up the works worse than they were. Carter then 
passed out his home number on business cards that the ten year-old Rooney had hand- printed out for him. By the time he got back 
to Dundee that night he already had two messages on his answering machine. For the next year, Carter got up at five in the 
morning and drove down and hung out at the truck stop coffee shop with a small CB handset so he could natter to incoming 
eighteen- wheelers. Word got around that you could get almost everything up to and including a full engine re- build from Carter 
and his boys, and for cash you could get it at least a third cheaper than anywhere else on the west coast A fter a year they had 
enough to open their own place just off the same exit. For independent owner- operators, sometimes Wingfield High Performance 
was all that kept them on the road. By the time I met them. Carter had maintenance contracts from four or five major trucking 
lines and was employing almost twenty people. Ma kept the books so creatively that they never paid the IRS a penny and did so 
legally. Carter also used his extensive teamster and Teamster contacts to spread Party propaganda nationwide. Y ou couldn&apos;t go 
into a single men&apos; s room stall or coffee shop or motel at any truck stop in the country without finding some Uterature with a 
Tricolor on it 

A fter dinner that night I wandered into the living room and took a closer look at the decor. In addition to the flag, hanging on the 
wall was a poster-sized broadsheet or proclamation on pale yellow paper. They were the Principles, which of course are now 
world famous and something every schoolchild in the Republic has to memorize. But at the time I had heard only very vaguely of 
the Party, and I had never read a single piece of literature or had any personal contact with the independence movement at all. I 
read over the poster: 

Fuadameatal Priaciples of Northwest M igratioa 

I. The White race in North America is in danger of literal, physical extinction. If current destructive demographic trends continue. 
White people will be a minority in the United States and Canada by the year 2050, and we will have vanished completely from 
North America by 2100. The real point of no return, however, is far closer. Within a very short time, the median age of the White 
population of North America will have become so high that we will no longer be capable of reproducing ourselves in sufficient 
numbers to overcome the tide of mud- colored Third World immigration. 

II. We as a people have wasted the past century on pointless, futile and impotent right-wing and kosher conservative organizations 
and strategies. The majority of these past organizations and movements refused to recognize the vital central importance of race in 
all issues, and they refused to recognize the urgent need for state power in order to preserve the existence of our race. The few 
attempts which have been made to resist racial extinction by groups and personalities of an openly National Socialist or racialist 
nature have been led by men who were stupid, incompetent dishonest or some combination of all three. The result of the past 
hundred years of right wing failure and impotence is that we are now out of time. 

III. There is only one strategy remaining to us which may be able to secure the existence of our people and a future for White 
children. Our last remaining hope to stave off extinction is the establishment of a sovereign and independent nation on the 
continent of North America for White people only. 

IV. Considerations of demographics and economics, as well as a history of commitment and martyrdom in the persons of Bob 
Matthews, Sam and Vicky Weaver, and Richard Butler dictate that the territory for this sovereign Aryan republic must lie in the 
Pacific Northwest 

V . The first step toward the establishment of the Northwest A merican Republic is a mass migration of the existing racially aware 
White community to the states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. It is a matter of the utmost urgency to make this vitally 
important commitment to the future of our people, that you do so now, and that you come to the Homeland with only the 
minimum delay necessary to raise sufficient funds and put your affairs in order. 

&quot;Whats all this?&quot; I asked Rooney, pointing at the poster. 

&quot;White people have to get our own country,&quot; she told me matter- of- factly. &quot;If we don&apos;t get free of the United States, the niggers 

and Jews and Mexicans are going to kill us all off because they hate us so bad, and there won&apos;t be any more White people in the 

world. Our new country&apos;s gone be here in the Northwest and that s why we came here.&quot; 

&quot;Where did you come from?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Roper&apos;s Crossroads. I was bom there. Thats a little bump in the road back in Florence County, South Carolina. We took the gap 

about five years ago.&quot; 

&quot;Took the gap?&quot; I asked, puzzled, never having heard the term before. 

&quot;We Came Home, here to the Northwest which is where God appointed the Homeland of all Aryan nations to be,&quot; she explained. 

&quot;Oh, you mean you&apos; re spuckies! &quot; I said, sudden enlightenment dawning. I had a very vague idea what spuckies were. Every now 

and then the TV would complain about racist whites moving to the Northwest and they&apos; d show film clips of really geeky looking 

skinheads and weirdos with tattoos wearing strange costumes and trying to goose-step and give Nazi salutes. 

&quot;Well, yeah, but we don&apos;t hke being called that&quot; said Rooney primly. &quot;We prefer to call ourselves settlers or Incomers.&quot; 

&quot;Uh, aren&apos;tyou guys all supposed to be out in the woods in Idaho living in compounds or something?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;No, silly, the entire Northwest is our Homeland, and we hope when the time comes we can take Alaska and Montana and a big 

chunk of Canada too. Thats our flag.&quot; She pointed to the Tricolor on the wall. I recalled seeing weird graffiti spray-painted on 

walls and highway underpasses around the county. Three vertical stripes, like three lines or tick marks, blue, white, and green. All 

of a sudden I had this vision of Rooney out spray-painting at night and I could believe it 

&quot;What do the colors mean?&quot; I asked. 

A Distant Thunder 41 



&quot;Blue for the sky above, green for the land below, and white for the people in between/&apos; said Rooney. &quot;I think they originally 

wanted the colors running top to bottom, but the kaffirs in Sierra Leone already had that for their flag, so we ran the three colors 

European- style, left to right.&quot; 

&quot;Pretty simple symbohsm,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Y eah, the movement adopted that pattern because we want to keep it deliberately simple. Some folks, like us, wouldn&apos;t mind 

seeing a Celtic cross or something Christian in that white field, and the NS people want a swastika, of course, and the Odinists 

want a raven or a Thor&apos; s hammer or something, but our new country has to be for all white people everywhere regardless of their 

religious behef, or else it won&apos;t serve its purpose of bringing all the Aryan nations together so that all can survive. Also, once the 

revolution starts you can take apart a Tricolor real quick and all of a sudden it&apos; s no longer an act of treason, it&apos; s just three pieces of 

cloth.&quot; 

&quot;Uh, okay, so when does the revolution start?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;It already started before we were even bom,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you ever hear of Bob Matthews?&quot; 

&quot;Uh, no,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I don&apos;t know much about all this racial stuff.&quot; 

&quot;Then it&apos; s time you learned,&quot; spoke up Carter from behind us. &quot;Shane, you know Mr. Morehouse from your high school?&quot; 

&quot;The biology teacher?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;That&apos;s him,&quot; said Carter. &quot;Well, he doesn&apos;t just teach biology, he teaches history. The right kind of history.&quot; 

&quot;Huh? I never heard anything about him teaching history,&quot; I said curiously. 

&quot;Not at Dundee High,&quot; said Rooney. &quot;We got a group of students from Dundee and Centraha who meet after school, here and in 

different people&apos; s houses, and sometimes when the weather&apos; s nice we get together for field days up in M illersylvania Park. W e 

have classes, with a blackboard and everything. We even get homework.&quot; 

&quot; Y ou&apos; re telling me you get together after school just to get more homework?&quot; I asked skeptically. 

&quot;This homework washes out the taste of the other kind. It&apos;s fun. We use books that the pubhc schools don&apos;tuse any more because 

they&apos; re politically incorrect We study about the real history of our race and our civilization, and we learn the things that the ZOG 

government doesn&apos;t want us to know. We also have Mrs. Barrett from Chehalis High who comes in and teaches us real English 

literature, not that PC crap we get dished out from that yenta Ms. Abramowitz in our own school. We&apos;re reading Kipling&apos;s 

suppressed racial poems now, and for a novel we&apos;ve got some copies of Arthur Conan Doyle&apos; s The White Company we&apos; re passing 

around. Once everybody has read it we&apos; 11 be doing an essay on the Aryan values portrayed in the book.&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;ve read it,&quot; I said with some pride. &quot;It&apos;s the second Sir Nigel Loring novel.&quot; 

&quot;Then you can help us analyze it in discussion group,&quot; she said. &quot;This is kind of an unofficial way of getting us an education in 

spite of the public school system. Our class is meeting tomorrow night. Y ou want to come?&quot; 

&quot;Sure,&quot; I agreed. If it had meant getting to see her again I would have come to an appendectomy. I had no idea at the time how 

important that night was to prove in my life, but I had just been introduced to the Party and to the Northwest independence 

movement. 

My childhood was over, and about damned time. It really sucked. 

The Rising of the Moon 

&quot;0 then tell me, Sean O&apos;Farrell, where the gathering is to be?&quot; 
&quot;In the old spot hy the river right well known to you and me. 

One word more: for signal token, whistle up the marching tune. 
For the pikes must he together hy the rising of the moon!&quot; 
-Traditional 
I&apos;ve seen a lot of movies and televids that are supposedly about the early days before the revolution. They show people getting 
sworn into the Party at the stroke of midnight in some secret hideout, along with some dramatic Mafia- style blood oath ceremony, 
with candles and Tricolors and swastika banners and pictures of the Fiihrer all over. Hey, maybe it actually happened like that in 
some places. But not in Dundee, Washington. In Dundee we just had our own crowd who accepted the Principles and wanted our 
own country with jobs and medical care and no Mexicans and no Leon Sorels beating on people. Out of that grew little teams and 
affinity groups of people we trusted. That was the Party in Dundee, and when time and place served we became the local NVA. 
Besides, by tiie time I came along the Party had abolished formal membership anyway, because the government kept trying to 
make it into a criminal conspiracy case. I understand that in the old days before Northwest Migration, and even for a little while 
after the Migration got started, there were so-called white racist groups that would let any Tom, Dick, and Harry fill out a 
membership application and send it in by mail, of all the insane things, and so long as you also sent in your ten dollars for your 
first month&apos; s dues you would get a membership card, sight unseen. Some even would let you apply online and use your Visa or 
Mastercard to become a real live white supremacist extremist. Hell, with some of those ripoffs if you sent in enough box tops you 
got a secret decoder ring as well. I mean, Jesus, how stupid is that? What kind of revolutionary movement takes Visa and 
Mastercard? I always wondered why white people in those days couldn&apos;t tell that all those little Fearless Leader types weren&apos;t 
really serious. Or why no one seemed to care. 

The first thing you need to understand about the Party in those days was that it wasn&apos;t ever a democratic political party, in the 
sense of running candidates in elections like the Repubhcans and Democrats. Don&apos;t be fooled by the fact that we occasionally 

A Distant Thunder 42 



contBsted a few local elections across the Northwest, and even won a few. Those were carefully selected and planned exercises in 
propaganda and psychological warfare, and their purpose was to let us take advantage of the severely limited legal status it gave 
us, at least for the duration of the campaign. After the votes were in ZOG always came after everybody involved, investigating 
and arresting and prosecuting them if they could for any little pissant election law violation they found, so we didn&apos; t even bother 
to run for town council very often. We were never under any illusion that we would vote our way into power anyway, and despite 
what you hear about the alleged debate within the Party between the revolutionaries and the kosher conservatives, I don&apos; t recall 
ever meeting anybody who was dumb enough to think we could win at the ballot box. That so-called debate was pretty much over 
by the time I got involved. We all understood that the whole system we lived under was deliberately constructed to make sure that 
ordinary people like us never got anywhere near state power and never got into any position where we might actually get our 
fingers into the cookie j ar. State power was for the rich only, for lawyers, J ews, and white men without souls in expensive 
business suits. Period, end of story. All of the instruments of law and government in the United States, the news media, the right to 
speak and have your voice heard, the right to be treated with respect and not be kicked like a dog and used as a teat to be milked 
for money, all that was for the rich, the one percent of the population that controlled ninety- nine percent of the world&apos; s wealth and 
all of its people. Po&apos; white boys need not apply. 

At one point we had a local sympathizer named Max Morton who decided to run for mayor of Dundee on a Party platform against 
the incumbent, Ole Stolen, which I always thought was a really appropriate name for that crook. Before the campaign got really 
started. Max&apos; s campaign manager was arrested and charged with tax evasion, petty stuff but big headlines in the Advertiser of 
course. Max started getting anonymous phone and e-mail threats that shook him; Red Morehouse told us confidentially he didn&apos;t 
think our candidate was going to stand up. Then one night Leon Sorels and a couple of other Dundee cops pulled Max over and 
beat him almost to death with their nightsticks. When Morton got out of the hospital he was a broken man in every sense of the 
word. He fled the area, we never heard from him again, and after that we never bothered with elections in Dundee. There is no 
point in playing against a stacked deck, and I&apos;m somewhat surprised that Morton ever thought there was. 
Red Morehouse taught us early on that there was never any such thing in America as democracy, at least not since the time of 
Andrew Jackson. After 1861 when Lincoln called up the military to kill other Americans for exercising their Constitutional right 
to say no, there was no more Constitution in any sense that men like Jefferson or Franklin would have understood. After 1913 
when the Federal Reserve was created and the American money supply handed over to the J ews, there was no more free 
enterprise. After Roosevelt seized power in 1933, control of the apparatus of state passed out of the hands of the original racial 
stock who created America and into the hands of an evil alien race who had no business being here in the first place. After the 
Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1965, which made the President of the United States a military Caesar with the power to invade other 
countries at will, there was for all practical purposes no more legislative branch of government. From that point on Congress was 
just a revolting ball of soft, squishy, yea-saying leeches, bloated from feeding off the blood of America. After Roe versus Wade in 
1972 there was no more right to life itself. Babies could be murdered because they were inconvenient, and after that precedent was 
set anyone could be murdered because they were inconvenient. After Bush Two staged a coup d&apos; etat in 2000 and had himself 
appointed president by the Supreme Court, there was no longer any pretense of election. Presidents were made or broken in the 
corporate boardrooms, and except for a few really nasty cases like Hillary Clinton they were just figureheads for the corporations 
anyway. A fter the Patriot A ct there was no longer even the pretense of personal freedom, and after that came the D ees A ct, the 
SchumerAct, the Senior Citizens&apos; Quality of Life Act that let that kike doctor murder my father, so forth and so on. And of course 
the draft that dragged hundreds of thousands of young white boys out into the deserts of A rabia to die for all our wonderful 
freedom, which was in essence a reintroduced form of slavery. As far as human political development went, America from 1861 
on actually traveled backwards. 

The Party was an army of political soldiers, and our goal was not to elect our own crowd to some public office under a system that 
we despised, but to destroy that system completely and replace it with our own form of government. It&apos; s called revolution, and 
every society needs one every few generations to weed the garden. Liberal democracy was a playpen set up by and for the rich and 
the Jewish, and we no longer intended to play in it. Although we did use the existing political system as far as we could by 
adapting it to our own purposes, our entire goal in life was to prepare for the day when the revolution would start, and we never 
forgot that fact. Power comes out of the barrel of a gun, all law is based on armed force, and when one wants to remove the people 
who hold power and change the system that makes and enforces law the only way is through force of arms, because nobody 
surrenders power except at the point of the sword. The Party understood this and as a result, we were actually half-assed prepared 
when the balloon finally did go up. We had at least some kind of basic organization, we had built a base in the community as 
shaky as it was, and we had a rudimentary revolutionary structure set up of people with weapons, safe houses, transport and 
money. If we hadn&apos;t been ready, then there wouldn&apos; t be any white people left in North A merica today. 
While we&apos; re on the subject of the pre-10/22 period, a question I&apos;ve often heard asked is whether or not the Incomers were really 
necessary? Would not the white people of the Northwest have revolted against the United States on their own, without all those 
racially conscious white people from all over America and all over the world taking the gap to the Homeland before the Coeur 
d&apos; Alene uprising? I can tell you the answer to that one right now. No. Revolution needs a kind of critical mass, and without the 
racial settlers we natives would never have reached it on our own. There simply weren&apos; t enough of us and, before we got that 
transfusion of racially aware blood, we were all just as pig- ignorant about racial reality as the white population of the rest of the 
empire was. The Aryan Incomers were the people who made the revolution possible, and even though some of them were arrogant 
SOBs who called us woodchucks and Daryl and his other brother Daryl, we owe them our freedom. If the Wingfields hadn&apos; t made 

A Distant Thunder 43 



the pioneer trek from South Carohna and settled in Dundee, then there is every chance I would have drifted into booze like my 
parents, or drifted into drugs and crime like my one brother, or drifted into evil like my other brother who became a lawyer. Or 
just plain drifted. Either way, my life would never have amounted to anything, and I would have died years ago like my father in 
some wretched so-called nursing home, when some overworked so-called medical professional decided I was a nuisance and gave 
me the hot shot, or maybe I just would have been smothered with a pillow for fun by some hopped- up, grinning Jamaican 
&quot;caregiver.&quot; 

The Zionist power structure was feeble and incompetent and senile, but they knew what was going on with the Party and they 
retaliated. Not to downgrade the importance of what happened in Coeur d&apos; Alene on that one glorious day, or the shooting war that 
came after, but I have always felt that a lot of our historians either don&apos; t recall or else have never understood just how rough and 
violent and dangerous things were for us before 10/22. That was in the days when we couldn&apos; t strike back, at least not officially. 
Oh, no, we didn&apos; t always roll over and play dead. Things went on in the dark of night. ZOG knew that we could be proactive if we 
had to, and in a strange sort of way I think that saved us. I think there were still a few halfway intelligent people in the United 
States government who understood that there was potential for a major league disaster, from their point of view, and who tried to 
work out some kind of compromise that would at least allow us low level entree into the political process. Throw the white boys a 
few crumbs from the table, in a manner of speaking. But these few voices of sanity and reason within the power structure were 
ignored and shouted down. The Jews never did have sense enough to try the carrot instead of the stick, so deep and abiding was 
their hatred for anyone who challenged their authority and their right to rule our lives. 

We were at first ignored. Then when we could be ignored no longer we were harassed by low-level local thugs and Zionist bullies 
hke Leon Sorels. When we could not be run out of town or beaten into submission, ZOG tried to shut us down on a state level 
with laws that seldom said so outright but were quite clearly aimed at us. Whatever the Party did, the state legislature would try to 
ban it, sometimes rushing into special session to change the constitution, like that time the Old Man won the Republican lieutenant 
governor&apos;s primary and drove the whole J udaeo- liberal estabhshment batshit But the Zionist government was hampered by a need 
to preserve the appearance of freedom of expression and political hberty, while denying white people the substance, if you get my 
meaning. They tried to create a situation where technically speaking, the Party could exist, but we couldn&apos;t/unct/on. Under the old 
1787 United States Constitution, in theory we had the right to freedom of speech. But if we passed out a leaflet or put up a sticker 
that caused some godforsaken little minority &quot;mental anguish&quot; then it was a felony hatecrime. Or at least felony littering. Y eah, 
they actually came up with felony littering statutes; five years in the pen for tossing a leaflet or a newspaper on someone&apos; s lawn. 
When all else failed there was always &quot;civil rights violation,&quot; which meant whatever the U. S. Attorney General and the Federal 
courts said it meant. They once charged some white kids in Idaho with civil rights violation for throwing a dead snake on a 
niggeri s porch; all three of them were sentenced to life in prison. The Beast didn&apos; t just plain ban us until after 10/22, when the 
Party was declared to be a criminal organization, but we were treated like a criminal organization long before that. Well, we 
returned the favor a few years later when we declared the government of the United States to be a criminal organization. 
We were a legal movement that had to act as if we were an illegal one in order to survive. Even in our allegedly open and lawful 
days, the Party was structured on a paramilitary basis. Nothing fancy, just a lean and mean org table based on the two best 
working models of the time, the Provisional I.R.A . and Cosa Nostra. In fact, that s where Echo Company originally began. It was 
very loose, very simple and stripped down, but the basic structure of a revolutionary army was there. No state headquarters, just 
local units or groups that reported to a single individual, or at most a team of two or three superiors for purposes of co-ordination 
and efficiency. Above that level there was General Headquarters, which towards the end of the &quot;legal&quot; phase changed locations so 
often they never even bothered to rent a post office box and communicated only by phone and e-mail and through a few web sites. 
At one stage GHQ was operating out of an eighteen-wheeler rigged to look like a frozen chicken refrigeration truck, with the Old 
Man and a couple of other guys sleeping in hammocks and pulling in at state parks and truck stops to take showers and do 
laundry. The idea was that if ever the local units were cut off from communication with GHQ, most likely when the hammer 
dropped and we had to go completely covert, then every small team could and would function independently. Everyone knew the 
ultimate goal, independence, and everyone struggled toward that goal. As Robert Miles said, the Party was designed for us all to 
march separately but strike together. 

When I say we were political soldiers I do mean political soldiers. Each Party unit or group was ramrodded by a company 
commander, who was called the unit co-ordinator or sometimes group leader, on the rare occasions when he was called anything 
at all. These crews were small enough so everybody knew who was who, and when you said &quot;George&quot; or &quot;the guy downtown,&quot; 
everybody knew who you were talking about The unit boss set up small teams of three and four people with a designated lead, 
and with rare exceptions the team leads were the only ones who dealt with the unit lead, and then only one at a time, lest anyone 
conspire. Get-togethers of Party people on anything larger than a team basis for a specific activity were rare, with one exception 
I&apos; 11 talk about in a bit. The days of the big A ryan Nations-style gatherings, come one come all, any Tom D ick or Harry with a pale 
skin and two legs can waltz right in and welcome, mass rallies where sometimes the undercover agents and undercover media 
reporters outnumbered the genuine white racists— those days were long gone. 

Some of the larger Party groups that later morphed into NVA brigades had political officers or &quot;information officers&quot; who ran a 
special propaganda team of printers, writers, computer techies, media wonks, etc. to produce local propaganda aimed specifically 
at their area; most future NVA Political Officers got their start in underground propaganda or teaching. Some groups had an 
operations officer who acted as the group lead&apos;s stand-in and chief head- knocker, and sometimes there was a quartermaster slot 
filled by someone who supplied necessary premises and plant but this only occurred where those guys were actually needed. The 

A Distant Thunder 44 



Party very early on adopted a policy that form would follow function, meaning many Indians and very few chiefs. We were always 
very short on uniforms and fancy titles. None of this nonsense about Fearless Leaders dressing up in Napoleonic hussar&apos;s 
uniforms for the television cameras and proclaiming themselves Emperor of the North with some janitor in Beaverton as Crown 
Prince of Portland or whatever For a while we adopted the fedora hat as a kind of unofficial badge almost like gang colors, and I 
have to admit that it felt good striding down the street in a bunch with our shlapas on, but even that got to be more trouble and risk 
and attention- drawing than it was worth, the more serious we became. The Old Man was officially General Secretary of the Party, 
but no one ever called him that. Even this brief description I just gave you makes the Party sound a hell of a lot more organized 
than it was. Getting things done was a matter of &quot;I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who can help.&quot; Y ou knew and 
trusted a few people in a small group of comrades and by consensus or natural selection, one or two of those comrades called the 
shots. If you had special skills other teams would borrow your services, or if you had to relocate elsewhere in the Northwest you 
were given one or two contacts in your new area, and you either jelled with them or you recruited your own team. Each Party unit 
had a loosely defined operational area, and some whole groups had special functions like propaganda, technical, fund-raising, the 
acquisition of plant, etc. It wasn&apos; t all just us peasantry; there were Party cells to be found in Seattle boardrooms and police stations 
and military bases and even in a few television stations and newsrooms. Some of the early psywar ops were fun and funny, like 
trying to provoke or fabricate some politician or liberal big knob to say nigger and make sure they got caught by the media. I once 
helped plant some literature and other stuff in a key place that got our Congressman from Dundee in a lot of hot water as an 
alleged closet racist, not to mention a gent of extremely odd sexual tastes that got him in a lot of trouble with our small but very 
loud local feminist clique. The Party especially loved using deception, media manipulation, and razzle-dazzle scamming to stir up 
friction and trouble between the various minority groups and power factions, blacks against feminists, Mexicans against gays, 
hberals againstjews. Christians against Jews, blacks againstjews— hell, anybody againstjews. The more time the enemies of our 
race spent at each other&apos; s throats, sometimes literally, the less time they had to wonder what the Party was doing. 
The purpose of the Party was threefold: to educate the white population through propaganda and thus prepare them for 
independence; to recruit quality white people who could be of immediate and practical use to the revolution; and to prepare for 
the armed struggle against ZOG we all knew would come, without which everyone knew there would never be change. Everything 
we did was required to serve one or more of those three objectives. 

Our small Party crew in Dundee was pretty typical. It consisted of myself, the Wingfield family, a quiet middle-aged guy named 
John Pilafski who managed the only remaining white-owned convenience store in Dundee until the wogs finally ran him out of 
business, and the members of Red Morehouse&apos;s after- hours history and literature class, which we called the Chowder Society. 
Most of us were young. Red and Carter did most of the recruiting, including the careful background checking and look- over 
everyone got before we approached anyone. Y ou did not join the Party. The Party joined you, and that eliminated a lot of potential 
informers as well as drunks and nuts and other undesirables of the kind who befouled the pre- Northwest Migration white 
resistance movement, such as it was. Y ou don&apos;t leave the door to your house wide open and let any clown just walk in off the 
street, right? Y ou choose who to invite in. I later learned that before Carter approached me that rainy night on First Street, he had 
run a full check on me and my parents through his business, Rooney had stolen my school records out of the filing cabinet at 
Dundee High and copied them illegally. Ma Wingfield had gone into the laundromat and struck up a brief and unpleasant but 
informative acquaintance with my mother, and Carter himself cruised my trailer park and the local hangouts and found out what 
little else there was to know about me and my parents. 

A s far as preparing for the coming revolution, that was pretty much C arter and A dam&apos; s j ob. A dam had made good use of his time 
and the army and the two twins were planning on making good use of theirs when they went in. The rest of us were your basic 
litterbug, computer spam and spray-paint unit At least two nights a week we went out and did all kinds of hateful and horrible 
things, and we had a great time doing it. We moved and distributed leaflets, pamphlets, and other printed material in a hundred 
different ways, from slipping leaflets into newspapers in racks to be sold to sliding business cards with a Tricolor on one side and 
a slogan on the other into junk food containers in the grocery stores. We got into the high school computer lab and sent out tens of 
thousands of e-mails all over our district through various dummy accounts and anonymous servers located offshore, everything 
from complete copies of White Power to nasty little one-hners impugning Leon Sorels&apos; ancestry. 

Our crew of teenaged Jerry Rebs did one psychological warfare attack against the local power structure that to this very day I still 
think is an absolute hoot. It was Rooney&apos; s idea; she could be charmingly malicious. It took us two weeks of covert labor after 
hours, wearing surgical gloves so as not to leave fingerprints. We mailed out two thousand form letters to the upper echelons of 
the town of Dundee and Lewis County, written on a purloined copy of Ole Stolon&apos;s letterhead, printed on a high school computer, 
copied on the school copier and stamped on the school&apos;s postage meter In this carefully composed fake, Hizzoner our beloved 
mayor rambled disjointedly on and on for two pages like he was drunk or on crack, and finally declared his adulterous passion for 
a very prim and PC married civics teacher at Dundee High, a really arrogant and obnoxious feminist we all hated. He even 
included a little love poem for her: 

Who is it that hath burst the door. 

Unclosed the heart that shut before. 

And set her queen-Uke on its throne. 

And made its homage all her own?. ..My Birdie! 

The ridiculous poem was my idea. In my self-chosen course of eclectic and eccentric historical reading I always liked true crime 

stories, and it came from the Adelaide Bartlett murder case in 1886, written by a Church of England minister who fell for a slut 

A Distant Thunder 45 



who poisoned her husband with chloroforai. The damned thing reads just as awful and puerile today as it did in Victorian times. 
When it was read out in open court; at the trial, the Reverend Mr. Dyson was laughed out of his pulpit by the whole country and 
had to emigrate. The little jingle stuck in my mind and I thought it was so funny that I started looking around for something 
contemporary and devilish to do with it. So far as we knew, the mayor and Ms. Constanza had never even met, much less had an 
affair, and no one ever called her Birdie. But you&apos;d better believe she was Birdie from that point on. 
Y ou see the essence of psychological warfare as opposed to the shooting kind? Y ou destroy the target&apos; s mind and his will to 
continue instead of his body. There are times when it&apos; s better to make a public fool out of an enemy than to kill him and make him 
a martyr, and risk him maybe being replaced by someone who&apos; s more competent and more dangerous. That whole letter was 
bogus from beginning to end, a practical joke by teenagers, and yet it completely ruined Stolen and caused the liberal bitch to have 
a nervous breakdown. Stolen spent the next month yelling and hollering in the newspapers and on local TV and radio about how it 
was a hoax and his enemies were out to get him, but no one in Dundee ever quite took him seriously again. Ms. Constanza tried to 
ignore the whole thing, but all the while everybody in town was snickering behind their backs, making little bird calls and flapping 
their hands hke bird wings, leaving Big Bird toys and birdwatchers&apos; books on their desks for them to find, playing &quot;Bird Is The 
Word&quot; over the school intercom, you get the picture. Ms. Constanza had no sense of humor at all to begin with, and it drove her 
totally nuts. The flap led to so much recrimination and confusion and investigations and hoo-ha that she left at the end of that 
term, and Stolen&apos; s credibility as a civic leader was severely shaken as well as his self confidence, which was a plus for the NV A 
when we started shooting up the town and making things go boom in the night. 

Revolution is bloody and deadly, but it can also be more laughs than a barrel of monkeys if you play it right. 
Above all, the Party encouraged flag actions. One flag is worth a thousand words, once you can be sure that everyone in your 
community knows what that flag stands for. Once they know, people need to see it everywhere. We had hundreds of Tricolors 
made up out of everything from crepe paper to plastic to silk, and we stuck them up everywhere, sometimes running full-size 
Tricolors up the flagpole at the post office and other buildings and steel- strapping the lanyards to make sure the flag stayed up for 
at least a couple of hours of daylight. We had Tricolor stickers, with or without slogans, some just on gummed paper, some in 
vinyl with a kind of super- glue that Carter made up in his workshop that had to be sandblasted off wherever we slapped them up. 
We made sure that blue, white, and green color scheme was imprinted in everybody&apos; s mind: we had Tricolor stickers, business 
cards, leaflets and of course many cans of spray paint. 

Lest all this sound like kid stuff, you need to remember the times. The things we did were good practice for future NV A 
operations, because they were plenty dangerous. Slip up on a sticker raid and you end up in the same prison along with the 
comrade who shoots a spic and with almost as much time on your sentence. In the eighteen months prior to 10/22, over two 
hundred people in the Northwest received prison sentences ranging from five to twenty years for various hatecrime counts ranging 
from Federal felony littering to Federal felony vandalism to Federal felony criminal mischief, and of course anything that was 
done on a school or university ground or a place of employment, whether you were employed there or not, was covered by the 
Dees Act. During that time six comrades were shot dead by the police in the act of distributing unlawful literature or spray- 
painting. The youngest was twelve years old. Their names are on the Wall of the Martyrs on the Capitol Mall in Olympia. ZOG 
also tried to get us on anti-tagging laws originally brought in to try and stop Mexican and nigger gangs from spray- painting their 
gang symbols and art work all over public transport, then when that wasn&apos;t strong enough it became &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot; to 
cause mental anguish to our poor little dusky brethren. The hell of it was, we really didn&apos;t do all that much racial slurring, for 
psychological reasons. We understood that spray -painting nigger on walls didn&apos;t really resonate with ordinary people. It looked 
petty and childish. Most of the impromptu redecorating of the landscape we did was the standard blue, white, and green stripes 
and something hke &quot;Mexicans Out, Whites Back To Work&quot;, &quot;White Freedom&quot; or &quot;A Northwest Nation&quot; as a slogan. 
All that having been said, these nocturnal escapades were some of the best fun I ever had. Not to mention the fact that they served 
as dates with Rooney. Our relationship had developed on lines which were very odd for the time, when adolescent boys and girls 
viewed one another as targets, competitors, trophies, or sex objects. Y ou couldn&apos;t really call it platonic, because the illegal 
political activity created a kind of intensity that merged with normal teenage sexual tension was a real high, but I was perfectly 
happy to be a comrade-in-arms, and she always gave me to understand without a word that I was someone special to her, that I 
had been chosen, and that one day it would be time. I was so sure of this that I was never in any way jealous of any of the other 
guys my age who were involved in our Party unit. But nothing was ever said. How can I explainthis? You just didn&apos;t talk about 
things like that with Rooney. There was always so much more important and much more interesting stuff going on. In one way 
this was very good for me. Most teenaged boys back then, and today as well I suppose, spend most of their time pre- occupied with 
their dicks. That part of my life was taken care of by my initiation into the Wingfields&apos; extended family, and so I exercised my 
mind instead, which is a very lucky thing for a young man to have occur in his life. 

I don&apos;t think that during my entire high school period Rooney and I ever actually went out with each other, alone, on any occasion 
that was purely social and not racial in some way. I have to admit, I was really disappointed not to be able to take her to the senior 
prom, but not only did the Wingfields frown on dancing for religious reasons and because it made white kids act like niggers, but 
Rooney scoffed at the idea herself. &quot;Lord, Shane, can you see me tryin&apos; to dance!&quot; she cackled in good-humored derision. &quot;I&apos;d 
look hke an oil derrick in a tornado.&quot; So on prom night I brought Rooney a corsage anyway, and Ma pinned it on her denim 
jacket— she was allowed to wear jeans when we were out on a tickle— and she wore it all that night while we tossed Party 
newspapers on lawns and in driveways all over Chehalis and then sprayed a huge Tricolor onto the wall of the Shelton fire station 

A Distant Thunder 46 



while the hook and ladder crew were out on a call. We sat on the sea wall and watched the dawn come up over the mountains 
behind us and light up Dundee harbor together, and I got another kiss. That was our prom. 

I remember saying something as we watched the sea about how beautiful our Homeland was. &quot;It will be even more beautiful when 
we&apos;re free/&apos; she replied. 

Then it was back to littering and vandalizing for a while. But by this time the rich men in Lewis County were getting seriously 
worried about all the blue, white and green graffiti on the local hoardings and underpasses. Especially all that &quot;Mex Out, Jobs In&quot; 
stuff. The pale peasants seemed to be getting ideas above their station. Frightening words like &quot;living wage&quot; loomed in the rich 
mens&apos; nightmares. Well, comparatively rich, anyway, although our county&apos; s business upper crud was pretty small potatoes by 
Seattle or national standards. Profits at the sawmill, the cannery, and the paper mill seedling plantations might even be threatened 
if Hispanic labor somehow got the idea it was unwelcome in nice, friendly, liberal and diversity- celebrating Lewis County. This 
blue, white and green motif was starting to upset their braceros and madrugadores, and the rich folks&apos; housemaids and nannies 
were becoming scared to go home at night for fear of the evil gringo racists they saw hiding behind every tree. The pale- skinned 
natives were restless and must be sternly chastised, taught respect both for their betters and their betters&apos; dark-skinned pets. 
So they called in a special FBI Civil Rights Task Force with cart blanche to cleanse all of Lewis County of horrible, wicked 
racism, and that is how I had the unedifying experience of meeting Special Agent Bruce Goldberg for the first time. But maybe 
before I talk about that I should tell you about how I met Red Morehouse. Y eah, I know, I&apos; m jumping around, but you said you 
wanted stream of consciousness. The Goldberg story isn&apos; t important A Jew is nothing, just a Jew. But Red? Now there was a 

man. 

* * * 

One of the things the Party did very early on was to encourage our best people to go into certain professions which might prove to 
be of use at a later stage of the revolutionary struggle for Northwest independence. High on the list among those professions was 
teaching, and since teachers were paid some of the crappiest wages in state government for one of the highest stress and highest 
bullshit jobs going, there were never enough to go around and even in a devastated economy, jobs in education were plentiful. 
Especially in more rural areas of the state, where the pay was far lower than Seattle or even Dundee, but where the students were 
still largely of a certain pale complexion. Exactly the places we liked to recruit. Even in an economy that was on an iron lung, 
teachers could be sure of a job if they were willing to keep quiet during school hours, live on a peon&apos; s pay, and put up with several 
tons of politically correct crap per day in order to get at a few good and receptive young white minds with the racial message. 
Martin &quot;Red&quot; Morehouse had set up an unofficial after- hours school for those of us white kids at Dundee High and also some 
from the middle school like China Wingfield, who were interested in actually learning something, in finding out about the true 
history of our race and the way things really worked in society. We called it the Chowder Society, Red having asked us to avoid 
any specifically Aryan or subversive names for it. We would meet in the homes of various Party supporters, but especially often 
we&apos; d get together in the Wingfields&apos; back building, a corrugated iron structure that was kind of half bam and half garage. It had an 
upper floor where Carter had set up an actual schoolroom with desks and a blackboard and a stash of forbidden books carefully 
hidden in a specially built, concealed locker in the event of a raid. There was no curriculum as such for the Chowder Society. We 
would talk about current events or some piece of anti- white, politically correct crap we&apos; d just gotten in school from the official 
history teacher, and then Red would pull out one of his books, or sometimes a copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica 1925 edition 
he&apos; d found somewhere, and he&apos; d tell us the straight dope. 

There were about a dozen white kids from Dundee involved in the Chowder Society at any one time, and on a good night maybe 
seven or eight of us would show. This was that one exception I mentioned before to the small team rule. For many years. Chowder 
classes were the largest white gatherings or meetings I ever attended. I never served in a Flying Column, so I reckon it wasn&apos; t up 
until the newly-formed Northwest Defense Force was massing for the attack on Portland that I ever saw more than a hundred of us 
in the same place. Even my cell block at Auburn FDC only had about fifty Volunteers in it. Sometimes the Chowder class no- 
shows had to work, as happened when I myself was pushing broom at Burger Doodle, but in some cases the kids&apos; parents found 
out what was going on and got scared and made their sons or daughters stop coming for a while. Odd when you think about it. 
They would rather Kevin or Jennifer hung out in the park with the skateboarding dweebs chugging on malt-liquor forties and 
smoking dope than attend unauthorized and politically suspect educational events where they risked learning unpalatable truth and 
might end up using their heads for something besides a hat rack. Better a trashed- out doper or a pregnant slut than an evil racist 
Nazi. No kidding, there were parents who actually held that attitude. 

I&apos;m sure the school administration knew what was going on, but they were puzzled as to how to deal with it. If they made an issue 
out of Mr. Morehouse&apos; s little hobby and tried to fire him, that would mean bad publicity and a descent on the Dundee public 
schools by the news media and by heavy liberal bureaucrats and psych mooks from Olympia to denazify everybody in sight, with 
all the accompanying sound and fury. Those paper- pushers had experienced quite enough of that during my little set-to on the 
playground with Bobby Fernandez, thank you. Even worse, Mr. Morehouse might hire a lawyer and sue. He was a member of 
something called the A merican A ssociation of Scholastic Inquiry, which was pretty much a Party front group for our teachers that 
for some reason didn&apos; t seem to have branches anywhere but in the Pacific Northwest. A t that time the A A SI was considered 
legitimate if politically suspect, and it was believed that the Association might have enough money to hire a shark. Incorrectly 
believed. No one had any money in those days, the Party least of all, but the very sight of an attorney&apos; s letterhead sent people 
screaming into the night in terror. Lawyers were a contamination who destroyed lives and laid waste to whatever they touched. 

A Distant Thunder 47 



Technically speaking, there was nothing outright illegal about people simply meeting in someone&apos; s house and having a private 
discussion about history or literature, but it got the liberal administrators&apos; sensitive antennae quivering. They were pretty sure that 
this wasn&apos;t kosher in any sense of the word. Information and ideas were being exchanged between people who weren&apos; t supposed 
to be interested in ideas, and that makes any tyranny nervous. All communication in the United States was supposed to flow from 
the top down through the authorized media, that we might know the will of our lords and masters as to what we should think and 
believe. Occasionally the flow might be from the bottom up in the form of market research in order that the corporations might 
make money, but never from side to side where the establishment had no control over the content and was unable to set the 
parameters of acceptable discussion. Hence the millions of dollars spent and the hundreds of Feds employed in monitoring web 
sites and private conversations in internet chat rooms, although after the infamous Matt Hale case in 2004 no one in his right mind 
used them for anything politically incorrect This monitoring of private intercommunication was one of the more or less publicly 
admitted reasons for the inclusion in the Dees Act of the section that prohibited the &quot;creation of a hostile work environment 
through the exclusion of minorities and women and gay persons from social interaction in the workplace.&quot; Amurrica didn&apos;t even 
want its white wage slaves gathering in comers in the break room or the smoke hole and muttering to one another unless there was 
minority informer present. 

In the end the school board handled it in typical bureaucratic fashion. They pretended it wasn&apos; t happening, sent each other memos 
to cover their asses if it blew up, and prayed that if that happened it would be on someone else&apos; s watch. 
Red Morehouse was another first for me, the first live American National Socialist I ever met, although it took me a while to 
figure that out He didn&apos;t go around in a brown shirt, he didn&apos;t goose-step or wear a Hitler moustache, his hair was of normal 
length and neatly trimmed, he had no tattoos, and he didn&apos;t click his heels and yell &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; all the time. Red was an 
innocuous- looking older man with horn- rimmed glasses who more often than not wore a Mr. Rogers- style cardigan, but he 
managed to look scholarly as opposed to geeky in an epoch that didn&apos;t recognize any difference between the two. Over the next 
couple of years I discovered that he knew the Old Man personally as well as most of the top echelon people in the Party, including 
names that would later become household words, like Winston Wayne and Corby Morgan and Tom Murdock. But I learned these 
things through casual second-hand conversation. Red didn&apos; t name-drop. He didn&apos; t preach or try to argue anyone into his particular 
NS point of view. Red believed in planting seeds and letting them grow gradually. 

If you don&apos; t mind my getting a bit ahead of myself. Captain Morehouse later became our Political Officer for the South Sound 
Brigade of the NVA, which meant that the Party trusted him with what amounted to our spiritual welfare. The PO was the guy 
who took the political and military policy that came down from the Political Bureau and the Army Council and interpreted it for 
us and explained to us, if ever we had any questions, just why we were doing what we were doing at any given time. Which meant 
he had to understand it himself, so sometimes he had to move very light on his dialectic feet and be able to read the tea leaves. The 
PO had a veto on any operation a crew might be considering, if he felt the proposed tickle was in some way against Party policy or 
counterproductive to the war goals. He always outranked the actual unit commander in case it ever became necessary for him to 
pull rank, but with good political officers and good field commanders that didn&apos; t happen, and we had a pretty good crop of both in 
Lewis County. Red and Tank Thompson always got along well, which was a good thing. I know some outfits had problems with 
personality conflicts and political rivalries between the CO and the PO. 

Morehouse very seldom talked about himself at all. He was a single father with a small son and daughter who were the only other 
things in his life besides the Northwest movement His wife was never mentioned, and it was some time before I learned that she 
had become a drug addict back in Houston and run off with her Vietnamese pusher, who put her to peddling her ass on the street 
in exchange for crack. Then one day she actually took Red to court in Dundee to try and get custody of the children on the 
grounds that he was an evil racist She really wanted to sell them to It Takes A Village for a cut of the adoption bond. That kind of 
thing happened a lot The way I found out what was going on was that Red asked me to come along the night some of the boys 
went and had a quiet word of prayer with the wife&apos; s attorney, which I was proud and honored to do. That was the first full-fledged 
NVA tickle I ever went on, and this was even before there was an NVA, before 10/22 when we were supposed to stay legal, or at 
least be discreet The hell of it was. Red&apos; s ex still almost got custody even when her lawyer never showed up in court, and she 
might have done it if she herself hadn&apos;t been stoned on coke and vomited on the judge in chambers. Then she kicked a bailiff. 
The attorney? Still at the bottom of the Puget Sound off Budd&apos; s Point somewhere, so far as I know. Y es, ma&apos; am, I guess come to 
think of it that was the first time I participated in killing a man, but lawyers don&apos;t count 

Red didn&apos;t mind getting personal when it came to making a political or racial point though. One cold nasty winter&apos;s day I asked 
him how he&apos; d felt about leaving the wa rm place he was bom to come to this rat s nest (as I thought of it then) up here in the 
Northwest &quot;Shane, I was bom and raised in the Texas hill country, in a town originally settled by German immigrants called New 
Braunfels,&quot; he told me. &quot;I grew up not just with ten gallon hats and cowboy boots but sausage and sauerkraut and Saturday nights 
in the Hofbrau beer garden. If I had my way I would have lived out my life in Texas and died there, and if I&apos;d ever gone anywhere 
else it would have been to Germany, although the only Germany I&apos;d want to live in hasn&apos;t existed for a long time. Leaving that 
place where four generations of my ancestors lie buried, and knowing that I wouldn&apos;t be coming back, was one of the hardest 
things I ever had to do in my life. But it s by no means the first time our race has done such a thing, starting thousands of years 
ago when the first Goth packed up his wife and his kids and his dogs into an ox cart and headed over the hill. All those forefathers 
of mine buried in New Braunfels came from somewhere else. Long ago I recognized that I was bom into one of those times when 
my hfe was not mine to live as I pleased. With any luck my grandchildren might have that luxury. We don&apos; t not in this 
generation. God not only gave us life. He made us white. He did that for a reason, and it wasn&apos;t so we can just mn off into the 

A Distant Thunder 48 



woods and fields and dance and sing and rollerblade and get stoned and have fun. Life is duty. Y ou were bom here in this 
wonderful land, and I envy you. I had to come here by conscious decision, and it was a long hard road. But it was the right 
decision for me, and I will never regret it.&quot; 

Red was the first guy who was able to sit down and talk to me about the Jews. For the Wingfields it was simple: Jews were 
creatures of Satan and that was that Before I met Red I knew only what I had read in books or seen on TV about the Third Reich. 
I could read between the lines, I remembered what Mandelbaum had tried to do to me, and I knew that I didn&apos;t like the hose- nosed 
bastards because they were against A dolf Hitler and A dolf Hitler was my main man, but frankly I would have had a very difficult 
time justifying any of it with logic or facts. Not that it bothered me. Sometimes what&apos; s right isn&apos; t susceptible to logic. Y ou just 
know it in your soul. I remember asking Red once whether or not we really had a chance to win this thing, in view of the terrible 
odds stacked against us. &quot;Actually, I think we&apos;ve got a better chance now that we&apos;ve ever had since 1945,&quot; Red told me with 
assurance. &quot;You see, Shane, history proves one thing, time and again. The Jew will always overreach himself. No matter how 
smart and subtle and patient and organized they may be, eventually J ews always push their host peoples too far and then it&apos; s 
pogrom time again. Always. They are nowhere near as smart as they think they are. Clever yes, but theirs is not a creative 
intelligence. They can beg, borrow, steal and adapt almost anything in their host cultures for their own purposes, but they&apos;ve never 
really invented anything. They didn&apos; t even invent monotheism; the Pharaoh A khenaton beat them to that and the authors of the 
Bible even cribbed a lot of the Psalms and Proverbs from Egyptian hymns to the sun. Jews will achieve effective control of a 
society through years, sometimes centuries of incredibly patient plotting and planning and skulduggery, but once they do they are 
never content to keep on exercising that control quietly and from behind the scenes. The funny little man with the big nose can 
never quite bring himself to stay behind the curtain permanently. Instead, in his moment of triumph Y ehudi always lets the mask 
slip and lets the world see the arrogance and Talmudic hatred and hubris beneath it Winston Churchill, of all people, once made a 
very revealing comment about the J ews. He said the J ew was always either at your feet or at your throat Interesting, eh? It shows 
that he knew exactly who he was betraying his people and his country to, the brandy- soaked son of a biteh.&quot; 
I had read Mein Kampf, or tried to, when I was about ten, before it had been pulled off the library shelves, but I had understood 
very little of it I mentioned this to Red and he said, &quot;Hmm, yes, MK is a kind of tough sledding for a ten year- old, especially if 
you get hold of a bad translation. Let s start you out on the short catechism, so to speak.&quot; The next time we met in the Wingfields&apos; 
classroom Red handed me one of his illegal copies of Commander Rockwell&apos;s White Power, which by then was banned from 
distribution under the Dees Act through the infamous civil liability clause. 

In one of their many end runs around the First Amendment the Federal courts had really gone to town on the old dodge of using 
the civil law to punish people for things that weren&apos; t technically criminal and were even supposed to be constitutional rights, like 
thinking forbidden thoughts and reading forbidden literature. The tyrants in the black robes ruled that books on the Attorney 
General&apos;s list were controlled material like guns or drugs because of their unspecified potential to &quot;do harm&quot; and were therefore 
subject to registration and licensing. Y ou had to be over twenty- one, and then you could possess one copy only of certain books in 
your private collection if you could grandfather them and show you possessed them prior to the passage of the law, which of 
course meant registering your books with the government within a set period of time and thus identifying yourself as a dissident 
But you could not post books which were on the Attorney General&apos; s Index of Controlled Literary Properties to the internet or give 
such books to anyone else, without possible (read damned near certain if you got caught) civil liability for a &quot;human rights 
violation,&quot; and &quot;inflicting mental anguish.&quot; Meaning that any non-white or bugger boy who found out you gave something 
politically incorrect to someone else could file a civil lawsuit for violating his rights, even though you gave the book to a 
completely unrelated third party and the plaintiff never read a word of it or even saw the book in the third party&apos; s possession. 
Hearsay was enough for a million- dollar civil lawsuit that would gobble up every penny you owned in legal fees and destroy your 
life before it was dismissed three years down the road on a technicality. I.e. more damned lawyers draining everybody like 
leeches. Technically speaking, my parents could have sued Morehouse and stripped him to his underwear, because I was underage 
and he was poisoning my youthful mind with all that hate. I very carefully concealed my new unorthodox reading habits from my 
Mom. 

White Power simply blew me away. I read it in a single weekend and I was back for more on Monday. Red loaded me up with all 
kinds of wonderful hate. There were short hors d&apos;oeuvres like Britten&apos;s Behind Communism, Grimstad&apos;s A nti-Zion, Harwood&apos;s 
Did Six Million Really Die?, The Talmud Unmasked, Hoffman&apos;s Judaism&apos;s Strange Gods, and of course Sergei Nilius&apos;s 
translation of The Protocols of the Learned Elders ofZion, which under the Dees Act was in a category all its own. Y ou couldn&apos;t 
even own a single legally grandfathered copy of the Protocols, and after 10/22 possession got you ten years&apos; Federal time instead 
of the usual nickel. Our Party copies were printed off an internet server in Singapore that would publish anything if the money was 
right At one point ZOG actually sent a Green Beret commando team into Singapore to destroy that server. Next out of Red 
Morehouse&apos; s ilhcit cache of quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore came the longer, heavier tomes: Y ockey&apos; s Imperium, 
Simpson&apos;s Which Way Western Man?, Codreanu&apos;s For My Legionaries, Arthur Butz&apos;s Hoax of the Twentieth Century, 
Commander Rockwell&apos; s This Time The World, and the banned history books of David Irving. Finally, in my junior year in high 
school, I felt ready to tackle Me; nK amp/ again. And this time, I finally understood what the Fiihrer had been saying to me all 
those years ago. 

A 11 these books were part of an underground reading course put together by the Party that taught so many of my generation what 
was what Red&apos; s little private lending library contained several copies each of these and other works, and the only time he ever got 
even slightly aggravated with any of his Chowder Society kids was when they wouldn&apos;t return borrowed books. There was always 

A Distant Thunder 49 



a waiting list for everything. I was given one book at a time and strictly cautioned against showing it to anyone else, because the 
open possession of racial literature was starting to get much more dangerous than even civil lawsuits. We had to worry about 
informers to the Human Rights Hotline, brainwashed or just vicious nasty kids of all races, little damned sneaks who were told in 
diversity class what particularly evil titles to look for in their friends&apos; homes and lockers and bedrooms. In addition, the books 
themselves were becoming harder and harder to obtain. There were still some old pre- Dees Act copies from various semi- 
legitimate publishers, and there was more than one crude underground hand- press in the Party that could print and bind books in 
small numbers, but in many cases we had to make do with samisdat photocopies in binders disguised as computer manuals or 
college crib notes or whatever. The loss of a book was a hit to our unit in and of itself, but it also drew heat from the authorities. 
The U. S. Marshalls&apos; office were responsible for enforcing Federal court orders, and they were always trying to trace any copies of 
just about every racial book on our covert list and seize them under various injunctions and judgments from the malicious civil 
lawsuits the Jews and their allies were always filing against white people. When copies of banned books were found, they were 
burned. If a number of copies were seized in what the media called a hate cache, they were burned in a big bonfire in front of the 
television cameras. People found in possession of multiple copies of books on the Index with intent to distribute received crushing 
prison sentences for contempt of court, with maximum publicity, so all us white boys would know to keep our minds squeaky 
clean and don&apos;t go reading things we hadn&apos;t oughta. 

At the same time we were reading these banned books surreptitiously under the bedcovers at night with a flashlight, literally so 
sometimes in my case, we were reading and discussing perfectly legal but unauthorized books in our perfectly legal but highly 
unauthorized and suspect little seminars after school. This is a good example of the odd way things sometimes worked back then. 
Red was always sure to curtail any discussion or even mention of any book on the Index in Chowder class, because that might 
conceivably render it a &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Within the parameters of what remained of white dissent&apos; s quasi- legal but persecuted status, 
the Feds could not actually make a criminal case of hatecrime out of our little after- hours circle if we were discussing, say, 
Nathaniel Hawthorne&apos;s House of the Seven Gables, Waltari&apos;s The Dark Angel, or Conan Doyle&apos;s sci-fi and historicals. (I will be 
eternally grateful to Red for introducing me to Professor Challenger and Brigadier Gerard.) Ironically enough, they might have 
done had we been reading Huckleberry Finn, because of the infamous N word, but since that was actually a pro-nigger book the 
Chowder Society didn&apos;t waste time on it. 

History was a little more dangerous, but Red had a genius for using texts and sources that were kosher in themselves while 
imparting valid and heretical knowledge. A good example of this was the couple of weeks we spent analyzing Barbara Tuchman&apos;s 
A Distant Mirror. Since Tuchman was New York Jewish and female, we could hardly beaccusedof partaking of Dead White 
European Males, and yet once you disregarded her whining about the poor persecuted J ews of the Crusades, her book was a 
damned informative analysis of the Middle A ges in almost every respect. Y ou can learn a lot even from officially authorized 
sources once you have acquired the vital revolutionary awareness of what to ignore. A nother good one was A Ibert Speer&apos; s Inside 
The Third Reich, which reads very schizoid when you first try it on. But Red went through our four copies and very carefully 
blacked out about a quarter of the book, removing all the anti-Nazi crap that Speer had been required by West German law to put 
in, in order to have his memoirs published at all. The result looked a little like one of those FBI files you used to get under the 
Freedom of Information Act with everything important hidden by nasty ugly black bars, but once we got used to reading around 
the excisions then all of a sudden the book hung together and made sense, and we were able to get an awe-inspiring glimpse of the 
Reich in all its glory. Which I suspect was what the canny Speer intended all along. 

At one point, one of the Party&apos;s computer geeks in Portland named Wally Haupt scanned Inside the Third Reich onto a word- 
processing program, deleted all the same anti-NS parts Red had blacked out, and produced our own shortened, de-kosherized 
version which we then read on diskette or printed out He was caught by the FBI, arrested on a charge of felony copyright 
violation, and in the hullabaloo after 10/22 Wally simply disappeared into the Federal GULAG under the Patriot Act The 
Republic didn&apos;t find out Wally Haupt was still alive until almost ten years after Longview, and we traded some American 
sanctions spies for him, but when we finally brought him Home his mind was gone, and I do mean the man&apos; s mind was gone. 
They&apos;d lobotomized him. 

Red Morehouse had a couple of educational fortes. One was economics and the other was the Middle Ages, which is one reason 
he didn&apos;t mind using ajew like Barbara Tuchman as a source if the historical fact was straight up. &quot;A very neglected period in our 
history,&quot; he told us once in Chowder class. &quot;Political Correctness has never quite figured out a way to twist that part of our past to 
fit into their world view, and so the academic establishment tends to ignore anything from the fall of the Roman empire up until 
the Renaissance as much as possible. It&apos; s kind of a historical black hole, except for occasional pieces of PC crap like trying to 
claim Hildegard Von Bingen was a lesbian, which is completely untrue and which makes me want to strangle somebody. There 
are some interesting philosophical lessons from that time for us today, you know. Some years ago I was reading a scholarly 
volume on the Middle Ages when I came across a translation of a textbook or primer used to teach children of the nobility to read, 
kind of a fourteenth- century See Dick And Jane kind of thing. The book described all the various people who existed in the 
medieval world and their functions. The king rules by divine right the baron gives justice and protection to his people, the knight 
does deeds of valor for his lady love, the priest intercedes with God for the souls of men, the merchant brings goodies from 
foreign lands. It continued on down to the tradesmen such as the weavers, the butchers and bakers and so forth, you get the 
picture. Anyway, at the very end was a single sentence thrown in almost as an afterthought which described people who in those 
days were at least 90% of the entire population. It was a phrase which has stuck in my mind from that day to this: &apos;And the 
peasant toils so that all may eat&apos; &quot; 

A Distant Thunder 50 



&quot;That&apos;s like white people today/&apos; said John Bell. 

&quot;Y ou got it! &quot; said Red with a smile. &quot;I can&apos; t think of any better way to describe the role of the white man today, and many white 
women as well, once you exclude the artificial affirmative action- created female managerial class. We are high-class peasants. 
Our function in this society is simple. The peasant toils so that all may eat. Mexicans may heft and tote, but white men have to tell 
them what to heft and where to tote it White men build and drive the trucks that deliver the consumer goods, manufacture and 
package the junk food, maintain the power plants that keep the air conditioners and televisions running, cut down the trees and 
make the paper which keeps the bureaucracy going. White police and soldiers loyally cany the guns and pull the triggers for ZOG, 
in the Middle East and everywhere in the world. Above all, white men pay the overwhelming bulk of the taxes which keep the 
whole rotten system we live under afloat We sow, but never do we reap. We are serfs on the great worldwide consumer 
plantation, producing the wealth and keeping everything going while our multifarious masters sit on the veranda eating and 
drinking the products of our labor, and spinning their pointless little intrigues. Like all peasants, we have no place in the political 
process. Our role is to toil so that all may eat Our place is to accept with gratitude such consumer goodies as our betters see fit to 
fill our bowls with, to shuffle and tap dance and tug the forelock, to vote the way we are told to vote by our natural superiors the 
hberals and the Jews, and to apply our lips in the prescribed manner to whatever derrieres are presented to us. Finally, we must 
keep our minds squeaky clean of any impure doubt or racist thought&quot; 

&quot;But what can we do, Mr. Morehouse?&quot; asked someone else. &quot;I mean, I love going out at night and dropping paper and spray- 
painting for the Party, but that s petty stuff. It s not going to bring down this rotten system.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, peasants have been known to revolt Jason,&quot; Red assured us. &quot;Think guillotine, guys, with a pile of heads on the capitol steps 
higher than Tamerlane&apos; s tower of skulls. Think of a big gallows like a wedding cake, with layers and rows of dangling bodies in 
thousand- dollar suits with pedicured toes turning slowly in the wind. The French did it in 1789. The Russians did it in 1917, even 
if it was for an evil cause. The Irish did it in 1921, the Italians did it in 1922, the Germans did it in 1933. Even the Iraqis and 
Iranians did it and it looks like the Palestinians are going to pull it off as well. So will we.&quot; 

Red made us understand economics in a way we&apos; d never done before. I know economics is called the dismal science, but Red 
Morehouse knew that money was the source of all our enemies&apos; power, and in order to fight and win we had to have at least some 
kind of understanding of the way money worked, how it was created and used, and what the Jews had done to us with it One 
night he asked us, &quot;Okay, guys, how many of you know what usury is?&quot; 
&quot;Charging interest on loaned money,&quot; replied Rooney promptly. 

&quot;That s right but it s not just the act of charging interest Usury is an entire economic system,&quot; he told us. &quot;I&apos;m reading a book on 
Renaissance Italy at the moment and it s inspired me with a concrete example from the past to show how our present economic 
order developed. Greatly oversimplified, of course, but it will help you understand one aspect of just how the hell our European 
people have arrived at our present mess. First off, you need to understand that although Karl Marx was full of sheep dip in most 
things, he did recognize and articulate certain correct and vitally important truths about the nature of capitalism. Capitalism is 
utterly dependent on the exploitation of human beings for their labor, and in order to function capitalism must reinvent Man as a 
commodity, an economic unit of production and consumption. This dehumanizing concept has proven one of the most destructive 
aspects of the Jewish incursion into Western civilization. Secondly, capitalism is dependent for the generation of its capital not 
only on profit but on the highly cost effective form of profit known as usury.&quot; 

I know all this sounds really dull, and you probably think I&apos; m exaggerating about this guy getting a bunch of teenagers to sit still 
and listen to a long spiel on economics and the mechanics of the capitalist system. Under most circumstances, yeah, we would 
have been bored out of our minds. But bear in mind we weren&apos;t sitting in a stuffy classroom surrounded by photos of Malcolm X 
and Mahatma Gandhi and other reminders that we were second-class citizens in our own land, while an official of the state tried to 
jam horse manure down our throat with a spoon. We were meeting secretly in a basement to which we had come surreptitiously 
and in some cases lying to our parents about where we were going. We knew that if we were detected we&apos; d be in trouble and be 
punished, and anything the establishment hated and feared enough to punish was of automatic worth in our eyes. We knew that 
whatever Mr Morehouse told us was something that the people with power who made our lives miserable did not want us to 
know. That made all the difference in the world. Nothing like forbidden knowledge to perk up your interest in a subject 
Red was off. &quot;Usury is the collection of interest on loaned money, true, but it is much more. It is also the ultimate tool of Jewish 
power Usury was forbidden for centuries to Christians, which used to be pretty much the same thing as saying A ryans. Only J ews 
were allowed to practice it and any Aryan found charging interest was subject to a variety of penalties ranging from fines to the 
public removal of bits and pieces of the offender&apos; s anatomy. Modem day banks and credit card companies would have you believe 
that the economy is entirely dependent on the charging of interest but that s buUdust&quot; 

&quot;Tell that to my Dad who was just denied his Chapter Seven by that goddamned Judge Kaplowitz,&quot; said one of the guys, George 
Douglas. &quot;We&apos; re gonna lose our house because of the 29% interestonmy mother&apos;s operation last year,&quot; he told us bitterly. &quot;We 
had to put it on our last Visas and Mastercards because we didn&apos;t have any cash at all.&quot; 

&quot;Good example of how usury is grinding white people into the dust today,&quot; agreed Red. &quot;By the way, George, see me after class 
tonight I need to talk to you about that sitch. Y es, China?&quot; 

&quot;Mr Morehouse, how did white people make profits without interest before the Jews came?&quot; said China, who had raised her 
hand. I figured she had a good idea already, since China was smart as a whip and to my surprise already the best read and most 
politically astute of the Wingfields. Rooney was all heart; China was just about all brain. She&apos; d read Houston Stewart 

A Distant Thunder 51 



Chamberlain&apos;s Foundations of the Nineteenth Century at age thirteen and I still have heavy going myself on that one. My guess 
was she was deliberately helping Morehouse out. 

&quot;Good question. T he generation of non- production related profit through interest is actually a fairly recent development in man&apos; s 
economic history. So how did the economy work in the days before usury? Okay: let&apos; s say we&apos; re in Venice, a great trading city, 
about the year 1396. Usury is forbidden to everyone except the Jews, and their interest rates are as high as 50%, so no one but a 
drunk or a madman deals with them. They exist on interest mostly off the very poor, as pawnbrokers, and the Church has even 
estabhshed a series of interest-free co-op religious pawn shops to try and protect the poor from the bloodsuckers. But if you&apos; re a 
merchant, you still have to finance your trading ventures. So how do you do it? Let&apos;s say you want to send a ship to 
Constantinople full of Italian goodies, cloth and worked metal goods and glassware, wool, so forth and so on. Y ou want to bring 
back the same ship full of A sia Minor goodies like spices, mahogany, Turkish rugs, etc. W e will assign an arbitrary cost to this 
venture of 10,000 gold florins.&quot; The basement had a blackboard— well, a greenboard— and Red wrote 1 0,000 florins cost on it in 
white chalk. &quot;Y ou believe that the profit from the sale of your goods in Constantinople and the resale of their goods in Venice will 
yield 20,000 florins, which for the sake of argument we&apos; 11 accept as accurate.&quot; He wrote 20,000 florins gross. 
&quot;Where do you get the money?&quot; Red asked rhetorically. &quot;Y ou can put up the entire ten grand yourself if you&apos; re filthy rich, and 
many of the wealthiest merchant adventurers did so, as well as putting up their lives. These guys are not just businessmen, they&apos; re 
sea captains and explorers and occasional pirates, and they command their own vessels. They can opt to take all the risk, including 
the risk of the ship sinking or getting captured by Arab corsairs, and take all the profit. Or they can look for investors to share the 
risk. Since our hypothetical merchant adventurer is a good Christian who doesn&apos; t want to deal with hebes, and a good 
businessman who doesn&apos; t want to pay half his profit literally to a Shylock, he goes to one or more of the great Lombard banking 
houses, most likely several of them because they will be more likely to back him if their individual exposure is less. The Bardi, the 
Pazzi, the Strozzi, the Albizzi, or the up-and-coming Medici.&quot; He wrote the names on the board. &quot;These banks are centered mostly 
in Florence or Siena, but they have branches all over Europe in a day when the first Rothschilds are still haggling with peasants 
over the pawn of their wooden shoes for a few pennies. Our friend explains his venture, shows them the ship so they know it&apos; s a 
stout seaworthy vessel, lets them know he&apos; 11 be captaining the voyage himself, and points out that he&apos; s got a good track record of a 
dozen prosperous expeditions prior to this. He looks good to the Lombards, and so they lend him the dough. 
&quot;The total outlay for this project is ten grand in gold florins. The merchant himself will put up 4,000 florins, or 40%. The Bardi, 
the Strozzi, and the Medici banks will put up 2,000 each.&quot; All this went up on the board. &quot;They know they will have to wait one 
year for the ship&apos; s return to find out how they did. This is the origin of the old expression &apos;when my ship comes in&apos; . If everything 
goes according to plan, the venture will bring 20,000 gold florins, thus recouping everyone&apos; s initial investment and leaving ten 
grand profit. The merchant will take his expenses of four grand plus four grand of the surplus and the three banks four grand each, 
which recoups their loan and gives them a 100% return on their investment. Good business— -and something comes of it There is 
benefit to the community when consumers get a nice Persian rug or some pepper to put on Aunt Maria&apos; s lasagna, which in the 
days before refrigeration disguises the taste of the half- putrefied sausage she uses in her recipe. A nd don&apos; t even get me into 
medieval sanitation.&quot; We all laughed. &quot;Of course it was all a lot more complicated than that,&quot; he went on. &quot;For instance, in many 
cases the ship&apos; s captain, if he was not the owner, would have a substantial share and the crew would be paid not only a minimum 
wage but a small share each as well, plus there was taxes and overhead just like today — - but you get the idea. A rich merchant 
might send out ten ships a year under this system. Three would be lost, but seven of them would return, leaving an overall profit 
and V enetian society wealthier thereby. D o you note the difference between this system and J ewish usury?&quot; 
&quot;No interest,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;Profit comes from productivity.&quot; 

&quot;Bingo, Shane!&quot; said Mr. Morehouse, beaming. &quot;The Lombard banking system was based on production or acquisition of 
something tangible. Surplus value was to be created by buying actual things of value low and selling high, by making something 
or building something or undertaking risks to obtain something material and tangible. If the voyage didn&apos; t succeed, the investors 
were out their money, and this risk element led to a high degree of caution, canniness, and ability to assess risk as well as 
encouraging daring and enterprise for higher profits. A nother variation on this system was public works, for example the bridges 
over the river A mo in Florence, many of which were built by the bankers who were then allowed to collect tolls until they had 
recovered the expense of construction and a set profit, after which the bridges became free. There are endless variations. Money 
was lent for agriculture, to build a factory or a workshop, to build a road, whatever, but always something you could touch, feel, 
taste, use or consume. Money did not magically produce money out of nothing as it does with usury. The merchant princes of 
Renaissance Italy may have had a taste for luxurious living, intrigue, and poisoning one another, but they never threw money 
away like present-day governments and multinationals on loan interest. They had worked and sweated and bled and killed too 
long and hard to get it. 

&quot;Whereas the Jewish usury system is a shell game where money multiplies by itself without relation to anything in the real world. 
So-called value is created by the manipulation of numbers on a piece of paper as in, say, today&apos;s Stock Exchange or commodities 
market where there is only the most tenuous connection, if any, between the arbitrary value of the paper and any real or valuable 
object or commodity. Of course, from the point of view of the lender, usury has one advantage over the productivity or venture- 
based system: it eliminates risk, for the lender, anyway. But it increases risk many fold for the borrower who not only puts his 
business and his own capital on the line but sometimes everything he possesses. The borrower signs a bond or contract borrowing 
ten thousand florins and promising to pay back fifteen come what may, and as collateral he gives the lender the right to seize 

A Distant Thunder 52 



certain property if he is unable to pay by the stated date. The Lombard banking system was essentially a tool for the production of 
new wealth, while usury is a system for transferring existing wealth into a smaller number of hands, usually Jewish.&quot; 
&quot;So how did the kikes eventually move in on the system?&quot; asked Rooney. 

&quot;When did usury get its first foothold in the Western economy? Basically, when the Aryan ruling elite of that time, like their 
counterparts of the twentieth century, lost sight of their principles in the scramble for wealth, became deracinated, and started 
acting like Jews. Unfortunately, the first big capitalist usurers in modem history were these same Lombard bankers in their later 
stages. The Jews then slid in on the coattails of the regrettably accurate claim that &apos;everybody is doing it&apos; , and within a short time 
were running the whole game. Always remember: you offer the Jew a fingertip and he&apos;ll take the whole hand. Essentially two 
things happened. First, a lot of the Lombard banks crashed down through the years when they inevitably made too many bad 
decisions, creating fewer and bigger banks handling more money led by more unscrupulous men as the Renaissance advanced. 
Late Renaissance bankers and financial tycoons were often converted Jews, many of whom continued to practice Judaism in secret 
and openly favored their own people at the expense of their host nations. Additionally, the Church became corrupt and quit 
enforcing the anti-usury statutes, and the secular princes and dukes and whatnot got into debt to the banks and overlooked the fact 
that they had begun to charge interest just like the Jews.&quot; 

&quot;Just like the damned credit card companies now all operate out of South Dakota or Delaware, so they can charge twenty-nine per 
cent,&quot; said George Douglas angrily. 

&quot;Y ou got it,&quot; said Red with a nod. &quot;Usury crept into our economy in stages, and it was still frowned upon even as late as the 
nineteenth century. A character in a Sherlock Holmes story, for example, a ruined gambling nobleman who has mortgaged 
everything he owns and is about to lose it all, is referred to as being in the hands of the Jews by authorArthurConan Doyle, an 
expression one could still get away with using as late as the 1890s. Now, of course, we&apos; re all in the hands of the Jews. We&apos;ve got 
credit cards operating out of states like South Dakota with no banking laws to speak of, that charge twenty-nine percent revolving 
interest It&apos; s actually cheaper to borrow money from the Mob. Organized crime&apos; s traditional &quot;vigorish&quot; or interest rate being six 
for five or about eighteen percent&quot; 

Red had the true teacher&apos; s gift of being able to make history come alive. He was full of really interesting little bits and pieces of 
historical trivia, and yet he always used them to illustrate larger points. One night we were talking about the Second World War 
and the mission of Rudolf Hess, who flew to Britain in 1940 in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement and was imprisoned for 
the rest of his life for his trouble. &quot;It shows just how desperate A dolf Hitler was not to fight Britain that he allowed Hess to make 
his peace flight&quot; said Morehouse. &quot;Y ou see. Hitler already pretty much knew that the British would never accept any peace that 
allowed National Sociahst Germany to remain intact How many of you have ever heard of the Venlo incident?&quot; None of us had. I 
hadn&apos;t and I was fairly well read in things Third Reich- ish. 

&quot;Venlo is a small town in Holland, right on the border with Germany,&quot; Red explained. &quot;The German Sicherheitsdienst or security 
service ended up kidnapping a couple of British spooks from there in the early months of the war. In the winter of 1939 Europe 
was in the grip of what they called the sitzkrieg, the phony war. The Fiihrer knew that it was only a matter of time before the final 
showdown between National Socialism and Bolshevism, and he was desperately anxious to avoid a war on two fronts and make 
peace with the West while there was still time. Even before Hess, Hitler tried to make peace with Britain. This was just after 
Churchill had taken over from Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, and Hitler wanted to know if there was any possibility at all 
that Churchill might see reason and stop the war. 

&quot;So he had his SD chief, Walther Schellenberg, set up a sting on British MI6 or whatever foreign intelligence was called at the 
time. Schellenberg had one of his officers, who came from an old Prussian Junker family, contact two British agents in Holland. 
This was before Holland fell in the blitz, remember. This man told the Brits that he represented a cabal of disaffected German 
officers and industrialists and government officials who weren&apos;t happy about taking orders from an Austrian housepainter, etcetera 
and were allegedly contemplating a coup against Hitler, but they wanted to know ahead of time what kind of peace terms 
Churchill would be willing to offer. I can&apos;t recall all the various maneuvers; they went on for some months, but eventually the 
Brits were taken in and the proposal was laid before Churchill. Now, do you know what Britain&apos;s terms for peace with Germany 
and an end to the Second World War before it had even begun were? Churchill laid down only two conditions. First the death of 
A dolf Hitler and the dismantling of the National Socialist state. Second— and this is what gives the whole game away as to what 
that war was about— the second condition Churchill made was the return of Germany to the international gold standard.&quot; 
&quot;Uh, I don&apos;t get it&quot; I told him. 

&quot;Meaning that forty million human beings died because the Jews simply would not be denied their cut Y ou see the way the 
economy worked under finance capital, and the way it still works even today, is based on usury. Lets suppose you&apos;ve got German 
tractors needed in Brazil and Brazihan coffee needed in Germany. The old fashioned capitahst way of exchanging those two 
commodities is that the Germans go to ajewish bank in Frankfort and borrow the money to buy the Brazilian coffee beans, at a 
handsome rate of interest and the Brazilians go to another Jewish bank in Rio and borrow money to buy the German tractors, 
again at interest This way the Jews get their cut on both ends of the transaction, for providing nothing that is really essential either 
to growing and brewing coffee or manufacturing tractors. This is how these people have gotten over for thousands of years. But 
then under the Third Reich a financial genius named Hjalmar Schacht figured out a breathtakingly simple way to accomplish the 
same transaction much more efficiently, much less expensively, and above all eliminating the banker as middleman and 
eliminating the undeserved accrual of interest for doing nothing. Schacht established a G erman trade bank that issued a kind of 
Monopoly money called trade credits, which could be used for German goods. When the Brazilians needed German tractors, they 

A Distant Thunder 53 



sent a big freighter full of Brazilian coffee to Hamburg and in exchange got X number of trade credits, which they used to 
purchase German tractors. The big advantage to using this kind of system was that in order to get Western goods, the developing 
countries could in essence use barter of their own natural resources instead of having to come up with huge amounts of cash 
money which they could only raise by borrowing. If Nazi Germany had won the war and imposed their system in the place of 
usury, the entire International Monetary Fund would never have come into being and the international banks wouldn&apos;t have the 
entire world by the throat.&quot; 

&quot;Uh, Mr. Morehouse, what exactly is the gold standard?&quot; asked Adam Wingfield, who was sitting in that night, still oily from his 
job. &quot;I know a lot of kosher conservative types are all starry-eyed about a metal- based money system. Didn&apos;t National Sociahst 
Germany do it?&quot; 

&quot;Good question,&quot; said Red. We all knew he was about to go off on his favorite hobby horse again, but we didn&apos;t mind. Red was a 
real teacher; he liked to talk and others liked to listen to him talk. &quot;Let&apos; s back up a bit. Money was first invented thousands of 
years ago as a substitute for barter. For millennia money consisted only of gold, silver, and occasionally copper or bronze coinage. 
Why? Because these metals were rare and valued. Money only has value if everyone plays the game and believes it does, and 
accepts it as legal tender. Otherwise that dollar in your wallet is just a green piece of paper Ancient Pharaohs sometimes paid the 
wages of the artisans who built their pyramids and temples in garlic, you know. But in ancient times, men decided they valued 
gold and silver, and so they still do. D oesn&apos; t make much sense. G old is so soft you can&apos; t make tools or weapons out of it, and 
silver tarnishes like the devil, but that&apos; s just one of those inscrutable givens of human civilization. Value is quantifiable in gold 
and silver Now, coins are fine if you&apos; re just buying a jug of wine or a goat or whatever, but cities and empires and economies 
grew, and for major financial transactions involving what we call capital sums, using a purely specie- based monetary unit can get 
pretty ponderous. Eventually as commerce expanded, it became too cumbersome and dangerous to go on a trading expedition 
lugging long mule trains loaded with gold coin, so with the establishment of the first medieval banks the paper bank draft was 
invented, allowing a merchant in London to travel to Paris carrying only a document instead of heavy bags of money so tempting 
to bandits, do his business, deposit his profits in the Paris branch of the Bardi or whoever, and then draw them out again from the 
London branch when he got home. This was the first paper money, and it was specific, like a check made out to only one person. 
But it set the precedent of money in paper form being exchangeable for precious metals. 

&quot;Eventually the Lombard and later Jewish banks began to issue what today we would call negotiable securities or debentures, 
bank drafts for X amount of money with no name on them, which could be used as legal tender to buy, sell, pay, and lend. The 
practice of individual banks issuing their own paper money continued up until the beginning of the twentieth century; you can see 
all kinds of examples in museums. In the flourishing and expanding economy of a dynamic young America private banks, states, 
cities, even railroads issued their own paper money. But these paper notes or bills were always gold or sometimes silver 
certificates. That is, if you had a ten dollar bill from the First National Bank of Philadelphia and you took it in to that bank, you 
had the right to get a ten dollar gold piece for it. Paper money was originally intended as a convenience, not as a substitute for 
precious metals. Redeemability in gold or silver had one big advantage: it kept the money supply under control and pretty much 
eliminated the curse of inflation and insane interest rates. When there is only so much money in existence, circulating over and 
over again, then wages and prices stay steady. Remember, arbitrary as it is, mankind has decided to accord gold and silver the 
status of having value, and you can&apos; t start up a printing press and run off gold doubloons. If your paper money supply has to 
match the amount of gold and silver available to redeem it, and if accordingly the amount of paper money in circulation stays 
reasonably steady, then so do prices and wages. Economic stability leads to social stability and social stability usually means that 
ordinary people like us have decent lives. In a secure and stable society a man can plan for the future, build a home, raise a family. 
Almost all the inflationary spirals in the past, aside from the odd catastrophe like the Black Death which created a humongous 
labor shortage, have had to do with the uncontrolled issue of paper money, i.e. the Continental Congress period. Confederate 
money, the Weimar period in Germany, etc.&quot; 

&quot;I see what you mean, sir,&quot; spoke up China, &quot;But you say Hitler took Germany o//the gold standard and Churchill and the Jews 
wanted them back on it?&quot; 

&quot;Y es. Hitler and Schacht did that because by the early part of the twentieth century all the gold was in the wrong hands. National 
Socialism was just as anti-capitalist as it was anti- communist. NS Germany kicked over the table and created a controlled, planned 
economy based on the massive productivity of the German worker, while simultaneously taking the bankers out of the loop. The 
Anglo-Zionist international bankers wanted Germany back on the gold standard at least temporarily, so they could control the 
amount of German money available and above all stop that international trade bank credit arrangement that was costing 
international bankers untold millions in loans and interest. Not that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander Oh no, 
not at all. In 1913, this country did something so stupid that it defies rational analysis even today. We handed control of our 
money over to the Jews in the form of a private corporation, the Federal Reserve, every head and important official of which from 
1913 to this day has been Jewish. There is no such thing as U. S. currency, only Federal Reserve currency which is by law the 
only authorized form of legal tender It took the Jews twenty years to take us off the gold standard and free themselves of the 
obligation to back up their green paper with gold or silver, but they managed it, and from 1934 onward the Jews have literally had 
a license to print money hand over fist. The United States still has the big gold reserves at Fort Knox, but why? What do we need 
it for? A 11 that gold isn&apos; t redeemable for anything. Y ou can&apos; t walk up to Fort K nox with a ten dollar Federal Reserve note and get 
ten dollars&apos; worth of gold. After 1933 it was actually made illegal by the Roosevelt regime to possess gold or silver certificates 

A Distant Thunder 54 



that were redeemable in precious metal, and about fifty years ago the silver was physically removed from American coins so we 

couldn&apos;t even hold any in our hands in the form of a dime.&quot; 

&quot;But what advantage do the Jews and the international bankers get out of printing money like mad and creating inflation?&quot; asked 

one of the kids. 

&quot;They don&apos;t give a damn about inflation. The men who make these decisions are always wealthy enough so it never affects them 

personally and we&apos;re just peasants whose welfare doesn&apos;t count&quot; replied Red sourly. &quot;The ultimate goal of the usury system, 

ladies and gents, is for Y ehudi finally to get his hands on all the marbles. They plan to do this through the collection of interest. 

The more paper money there is in circulation, the higher interest rates are charged. Eventually a situation will be reached where 

ninety- nine percent of the world&apos; s population will owe one percent of the world&apos; s population an interest debt so colossal that it is 

equivalent to all the money in existence. True world domination, guys.&quot; 

&quot;But what do we do about it?&quot; wailed Rooney in rage and frustration. 

&quot;Oh, that s easy,&quot; rephed Red with a grin. &quot;We use another kind of economics based on a metallic substance. We shoot the 

bastards!&quot; 

* * * 

So we come to my first little run-in with the FBI. 

In the last couple of months of my senior year in high school, like most of my class I was just running out the clock and waiting 
for the hideous main event of life as we knew it to begin. Graduating classes all across the country were really depressing in those 
days. Every spring the media would be full of stories about seniors, white kids who committed suicide rather than be dragged into 
the empire&apos; s army or shoved out into the world we had to live in. 

By that time my fate in life was pretty much decided as far as the land of the free and the home of the brave was concerned. There 
had never been any question of college for a trailer trash kid like me, at least not one with my grades. Oh, I suppose if I&apos; d gotten 
onto the nerd track about sixth grade and brought in nothing but straight A &apos; s from that point on, I might have qualified for some 
kind of scholarship to Evergreen College, or maybe even the University of Washington. ZOG could always use techies to keep 
their toys running. There were still a few places for white boys once all the blacks and spies and gooks and Jews and Indians and 
left-handed Eskimo lesbians and every other little minority under the sun had gotten their piece of the quota pie, and UW did have 
a small reserved quota for Washington state residents of any race. 

Y eah, I might have gotten in. Certainly I might have made something of myself under ZOG if I had established from a very young 
age that was what I wanted. If I had raised my voice in songs of praise to diversity and trained my lips to pucker in the presence of 
every black, brown, yellow, and kosher ass I came across, yeah, our lords and masters might have graciously granted me the 
privilege of having some kind of life serving them. Most of us who ended up in the NVA could have done that if we had wanted 
to. It&apos; s the ancient decision faced by everyone raised under tyranny, and people usually make it at a very early age. Do you just 
submit and keep a low profile and hope the bastards will never notice that you exist? D o you join in the fun and games as an 
enthusiastic participant and try to work your way into the tyrant&apos; s good graces so you can get your cut of the pie? Do you flee, 
which didn&apos;t really apply in my case since there was nowhere to flee to, nowhere on earth willing to offer a home to racially aware 
white people? Although there is now, of course. Or did you defy and die? That last year of my high school days was also the last 
legal year of the Party before 10/22, the last year that the choice of at least some degree of defiance without destruction was 
available to us. 

Most of the no n- affluent boys in my graduating class were going right into the army, and a lot of the girls as well, because it was 
the only job available unless you wanted to try for something at minimum wage the Mexicans hadn&apos; t taken. I had done the pre- 
registration screening for the draft at age seventeen, like I was supposed to, and I expected to be classified 4-F not only because of 
the Bobby Fernandez incident in third grade, but also because by then the various informers and other surveillance around the 
school would certainly have picked up on the fact that I was politically incorrect and associating with undesirable Elvis lookalikes 
and white chicks in long skirts. The FBI had a file on me like it had on pretty much everybody. In fact I had received the form 
letter only the day before informing me that my country would not be requiring my services as a warrior for civilization and 
Christendom in whatever phase the Ninth Crusade was in. If memory serves, the Americans had finally pulled out of Afghanistan 
after a whole generation of savage guerrilla warfare, and so that would make it the year before that they were chased out of 
Chechnya, so that was two hellholes I would have missed if I&apos;d gone into the American military. But they&apos;d just invaded 
somewhere else— Malaysia, Indonesia? Some tropical place with a lot of Mushms who killed some Israeli tourists, which of 
course required an immediate full court press on the part of whatever empty suit was in the White House. I can&apos; t even remember 
that after all these years. No, it wasn&apos; t Bush Four. It was one of the Clinton bitches, either the last year of that godawful hag 
Hillary or the first year of that brainless bimbo Chelsea. Never mind. The important thing was I was officially deemed unfit for 
service owing to Article Blah Blah Section Ishkabibble i.e. I was &quot;lacking in moral fiber.&quot; Or was it moral character I was lacking 
in? I can&apos;t remember that either, but whatever it took to be a good Crusader and slaughter Muslims, evidently I didn&apos;t have it. 
Well, they were right. I didn&apos;t. But slaughtering Jews? Ah, now that was another story. 

John Bell and John Hunt Wingfield apparently had the necessary moral fiber despite the fact that Adam had been booted out for 
fighting with his dusky fellow soldiers, which was bad, and beating them, which was worse. Rooney&apos; s twin brothers had gone into 
the army a couple of years earlier when they graduated. John Bell went right into the motor pool after basic. He ended up getting 
sent to some base in Saudi Arabia where they quickly discovered that he was an ace HVA C mechanic. In that perpetual hundred 
and ten degree heat you&apos; d better believe those officers wanted their air conditioners kept up and running, so J ohn B ell very 

A Distant Thunder 55 



quickly made Spec Five and established himself as indispensable. They actxially offered him double bonus to re- enlist. He pretty 
much had the run of the place, and so long as he kept things cool in every sense of the word he had a lot of time to play with the 
company&apos;s computers. Time he used to send Rooney virtually every item of military software, documentation, and technical 
material he could get hold of, which she passed on to Carter and Carter passed on up the line. John Bell even got caught once or 
twice, but he got away with it by pulhng ajethro Beaudine act &quot;G aw- lee, Cap&apos;n, ah shorely didn&apos;t know all that stuff was 
classified. My sister is real interested in the military and she&apos; s even better with motors than I am. She&apos; s thinking about comin&apos; in 
when she grad-jee-yates and I was hopin&apos; to get her out here to do Gawd&apos;s work civilizin&apos; these ragheads.&quot; Oddly enough for a 
Christian fundamentalist teetotaler, with an eye to the main chance John Bell had also become the base bootlegger, and he was 
great at getting that odd case of scotch or vintage cognac for the officer&apos;s mess. That&apos;s two useful skills he demonstrated in a bone 
dry oven- like Muslim country, so useful that he was able to talk his way out of any suspicious security issues that arose. After 
10/22 John B. was able to finagle his way home on leave, and then he deserted and joined the NVA. He ended up with Echo 
Company for a while and then with the Corvallis Flying Column. 

His brother John Hunt was more adventurous. John Hunt became a Ranger and fought in Grozny against the Chechens, and 
against Afghans in the retreat from Kandahar. When 10/22 happened he was deep in Lebanon where the United States was 
desperately trying in one last spasm to save Israel&apos; s bacon. It was a while before John Hunt was able to get back to the States. 
When he did he deserted as well, and brought over forty men from his Ranger company to the NVA with him. He finally retired 
about thirty years ago as a major general in the SS. 

But the army was not a problem I had to worry about. This was good in one way and bad in another. It was good because I would 
not be leaving town for three years and risking my life and limb for a government and a society and an alien race that I despised. It 
was bad because that meant that somehow I had to find a way to make my way in the world and get some money from 
somewhere. At least the military was a job, and by then jobs were almost impossible for a white boy without contacts to get. 
A ctually, by that time ZOG was getting so desperate for cannon fodder, or bullet magnets as the expression was back then, that if 
I&apos;d tried I probably could have gotten into the army. I would have had to do a lot of shuffling and tap dancing and tugging of the 
forelock and kissing black and brown ass, but I could have at least gotten a steady paycheck and medical benefits at one of the last 
places in America where a white boy could get those things. My guidance counselor told me as much. I know she had a kickback 
with the local army recruiter for every warm body she could conjure up for the imperial war machine, but somewhat to my own 
surprise I told her, &quot;No thanks. If I do any killing it&apos; s going to be for myself and my own people.&quot; I&apos; m sure that remark must have 
gone into my file. 

The school wasn&apos; t completely without resources for poor white kids. There was a kind of state scholarship available to technical 
school if I wanted to become a computer tech or an electrician or some other kind of manual skill that the system needed to keep 
important machinery going, and I was going to try for one of those and hope whatever was in my political file wasn&apos;t bad enough 
to debar me from that. There was also a kind of state workfare program that new graduates could get into. It provided minimum 
wage manual labor to local businesses, although you still had to compete with Mexicans and if you didn&apos;t speak Spanish you&apos;d 
have a problem because you probably couldn&apos; t understand the foreman. Even the Zionist authorities of the time, as uncaring as 
they were, realized that it wasn&apos;t a good idea to have a lot of unemployed, resentful young people of any race hanging around on 
street comers. They&apos; d kept the blacks more or less quiet and non- riotous for a couple of generations by bribing them with 
government handouts, and I &apos; m sure if there&apos; d been any money left that wasn&apos; t being pissed into the Iraqi desert, there would have 
been more goodies available for us honkies. Like I&apos;ve said before, there were a few people left in the corridors of power who had 
sense enough to be nervous about what was happening in the Northwest. 

The Homeland was peculiar in that way because we still had enough young white people left for that to be a potential problem. In 
most other parts of North America the remaining whites were all wealthy or at least sufficiently affluent to buy their way into 
college. Poor whites were so outnumbered and marginalized that ZOG figured they didn&apos;t have to bother with them. Once the 
courts adopted affirmative action quotas for the prison system, meaning that there had to be &quot;racial balance reflecting society at 
large&quot; in the prison population, then a huge number of poor white kids in the rest of America were simply given $50,000 fines for 
parking tickets which they of course couldn&apos; t pay, and in lieu ten year prison sentences. Prison was the only place that had a quota 
for white people. They were turned into slaves working for the privatized prison industries at fifteen cents an hour. Once more, 
Anglo-Zionist capitalism had found another source of cheap labor. At one stage an estimated 21% of the population of the United 
States was either in prison, under court ordered supervision involving some kind of slave labor, or else worked in the prison 
system as guards and administrators and support. Even at the height of the Red Terror of the 1930s, it was never that bad in the 
Soviet Union under Stahn. 

In fact, one of the few jobs that were open was the Department of Corrections, with desperate recruiters prowling the high school 
campuses and the state government&apos; s Y outh Job Fairs trying to offer us the moon and the stars if we would come work for them. 
They had a family medical plan, and at that point it was pretty obvious my Dad wasn&apos;t going to make it if we didn&apos;t get some kind 
of insurance and get that whiskey- rotted liver of his replaced. I was actually considering applying to the DOC, after one them 
assured me that my racial baggage from the third grade and my present political opinions would be no problem so long as I kept 
them to myself. They were that desperate for bodies to keep the lid on. I felt bad ai)out it, especially because I knew Carter had 
done time in prison and might do again. Hell, we might all of us have ended up on the inside, including the women, if we got 
caught littering or re-decorating one night. But Carter surprised me by telling me as far as he was concerned it was cool. &quot;In the 
first place, Shane, a man&apos; s got to do what a man&apos; s got to do. Y our father is sick and this seems to be the only way you might get 

A Distant Thunder 56 



Mm any help. There is nobody in this house who will fault you for that. In the second place, you would be amazed how many 
people the Party has in the correctional system, and I mean on both sides of the wire. Y ou will have access to weapons and 
supplies and information that we may need, and you may also be in a position to help white prisoners in general and our prisoners 
in particular. It will be damned rough and soul- destroying work. Y ou have to be pretty fucked up or pretty desperate to 
deliberately go to prison every day. But if this is what you feel you have to do, go for it. Anybody in the Party gives you any grief, 
send them to me.&quot; 

But that opportunity went out the window after my interview with Special Agent Bruce Goldberg. That was when I sealed my fate 
on any future I might ever have had with ZOG . I committed what was, at that time, quite possibly the only worse crime a white 
man could commit besides saying the N word out loud. I refused to become an informer. 

I was lounging at my desk in home room one morning in April— in fact it was about a week after Rooney and me had spent our 
prom night spray -painting the Tricolor on the fire station in Shelton— when I heard my name announced over the loudspeaker. 
&quot;Shane Ryan, please report to the Guidance Counselor&apos;s office.&quot; 
&quot;You need guidance, Ryan,&quot; said one of the guys. 

&quot;I figure Mrs. Dorfman is going to have another stab at getting me into the army,&quot; I said. &quot;I really do hate to miss out on doing my 
patriotic duty with the rest of you dudes.&quot; 

&quot;Kill Ay-rabs! U-S-A! U-S-A!&quot; bawled Bruce Boyd, one of our jocks. He probably meant it. He was too dumb for irony. 
&quot;Hey Ryan, if you get into the army maybe they&apos;ll send you to Africa to kill black Muslims,&quot; snickered somebody else. It was 
generally known that I was 4-F and why. Y ou can&apos; t really keep much in the way of secrets in a high school. In fact, over the past 
year we&apos; d gotten a bunch of senior guys coming around to me or Rooney or some of the other known subversives in the Chowder 
Society, looking to get involved with the Party just enough to get a draft deferment. Some of them even worked out long term. I 
winked at Rooney and sauntered down the hall to the office. Mrs. Dorfman was behind her desk and looked up at me kind of 
funny, like she&apos; d just bit down on a lemon. She just said &quot;Shane, please step into conference room number one. There are some 
people who want to speak with you.&quot; 

I opened the door and walked into the conference room, which was just another office with a round formica table and a couple of 
plastic chairs, a small counter with a coffee machine on it and a little fridge under the counter that had a few soft drinks and Mrs. 
Dorfman&apos; s lunch in it Behind the table sat a small and rather dapper man in his mid- thirties with neatly barbered black, curly hair 
and a clean blue- chinned shave. His nose wasn&apos;t all that prominent for a Jew, and he wasn&apos;t too bad- looking or threatening. He 
didn&apos;t radiate that greasy and unctuous feel like I remembered coming off Mandelbaum. He had nice friendly collie- dog eyes and 
he was smiling, and it didn&apos; t seem to be a put- on. Y ou got the impression this character was really glad to see me, that meeting me 
was going to be the high point of his day and he was looking forward to it. He was wearing a trim blue silk suit, and when I 
glanced under the table I saw the gleam of patent leather shoes. The guy reeked of Fed. &quot;Hello, Shane! &quot; he chirped in a cheerful 
voice. &quot;Have a seat, have a seat!&quot; I sat down, very warily, and waited silently for him to speak. &quot;I&apos;m Special Agent Bruce 
Goldberg from the Federal Bureau of Investigation&quot; He flashed me his badge and his ticket, and I actually looked at it Y ep, he 
was an FBI agent all right Not that he&apos; d had to introduce himself. I recognized a cop when I saw one. I especially recognized the 
cop standing behind the FBI man with his huge arms folded. 
Leon Sorels. 

At that time Sorels had just transferred from the Dundee town police department to the Washington State Patrol, and he&apos;d been 
given nice gleaming new gold sergeants stripes to go on his new uniform. Not to mention a good heavy new-model nightstick, 
Bakelite with a lead core and encased in hard rubber for maximum bone- cracking power with minimum bruising. I know I&apos;ve 
mentioned Dummy-Dummy Sorels before, even described him, but you need to understand the kind of personal presence he had. 
He radiated bad and menacing vibes, especially in an enclosed space like that little office where you couldn&apos; t give him a wide 
berth like we&apos; d all learned to do since childhood. Sorels was a big man, the only guy I ever knew who could have given A dam 
Wingfield a good tussle. He must have stood at least six foot six, he was over three hundred pounds, well over, and there wasn&apos;t 
an ounce of fat on him anywhere. Dummy- Dummy was built like the strong man in a circus, muscle- bound and out of all 
proportion, with massive rock-hard shoulders as broad as a mack truck, huge bulging biceps that seemed almost to split the short 
sleeves of his uniform shirt, bulging pecs that strained against the cloth, and gnarled fists with scarred knuckles that were 
amazingly small for the size of his Popeye forearms. All of this tapered down to a hard but tiny waist I swear I think his trousers 
must have been about a size 30, and so he looked kind of like a child&apos;s spinning top or some kind of cartoon character, triangular 
from the neck down. Although I shouldn&apos;t say neck, because Sorels didn&apos;t seem to have one. His head was god-awful. 
It was pretty well known that Sorels was a steroid user. When he wasn&apos;t on duty. Dummy- Dummy lived in the pohce station 
weight room. A mong other side effects, steroid aLuse makes the user lose his hair, and Sorels had started losing his at a very early 
age. To compensate he had shaved his entire head, and I swear to you before God that his head was actually pear-shaped, with a 
point on it We speculated that he must have been injured in some way at birth, that his skull was compressed or something. 
Maybe that accident at birth caused him some kind of brain damage that accounted for his distorted and evil personality as well. 
He either shaved his eyebrows or else he didn&apos;t have any, and it didn&apos;t help that he was as ugly as home-made sin to begin with, 
with a face like a Neanderthal. The overall result was grotesque and fearful. The man looked like a gargoyle. 
Then there were the other charming side effects of steroid use. The psychotic rages, for one. Also, according to gossip the steroids 
had apparently shrunk Sorels&apos; testicles to the size of pencil erasers and he was completely impotent as well as insane. He tried to 
make up for that with women through various perversions I won&apos; t get into, and when the prostitutes out at the truck stop or up in 

A Distant Thunder 57 



Seattle didn&apos; t sen^e his turn, he took it where he found it. It had gotten so bad we learned later that under a sealed court order, as 
part of a civil settlement in a lawsuit against the city, Sorels was forbidden to arrest female suspects on his own or be alone with a 
female prisoner. I imagine the Dundee cops were glad to dump him onto the Patrol. 

So why did even ZOG employ a psychopath? Because he was a loyal and reliable psychopath. Because a psychopath was what 
ZOG needed to keep the peasants in line and no one in authority cared any more how it was done. Leon Sorels was a man 
absolutely without conscience, without scruple, without a God, without the slightest twitch of human compassion. His loyalty was 
to whoever signed his paycheck and as far as he was concerned, that paycheck bought whatever service his employers wanted 
performed. If that included beating someone to a pulp, if that included torture, if that included murder, then Sorels would do the 
job and do it well, and clean up his own mess behind him. In other words, Sorels was a typical A merican cop. Right now his 
Neanderthal face was expressionless, but his little piggy black eyes were glaring at me. 

I refused the offer of a soft drink with a shake of my head, and said nothing. First rule in confronting an interrogation: never open 
the conversation. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you why I&apos;ve asked you to stop by,&quot; said Goldberg, leaning forward over the table, his hands clasped, 
speaking with a sincere and concerned smile. &quot; Shane, I suspect you have good reason to be aware of the fact that the FBI now has 
a special civil rights task force assigned to Lewis County to investigate a number of acts of domestic terrorism which have taken 
place here in recent months. It&apos; s a very bad and potentially explosive situation. Hateful racist literature directed against minorities 
is being distributed to householders. There&apos; s been a lot of vandalism and racist graffiti being daubed onto both public and private 
property, which is not just vandahsm but felony hatecrime, because that&apos;s how the United States criminal code classifies any 
crime which is motivated by hatred directed against any person due to their race, color, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual 
orientation. Society has come to realize that unacceptable thoughts and motivations have to be punished just as well as illegal acts, 
sometimes more severely than the act itself.&quot; For the first time I resisted the temptation to argue and ask him just who the hell 
determined what thought were acceptable. Like I didn&apos;t know. 

Goldberg leaned forward and looked me in the eye, trying to drill me. I responded like Carter had taught us. Y ou don&apos;t look the 
son of a bitch right in the eye. Y ou look between his eyes, right at the bridge of his nose between his eyebrows. That way it looks 
to him like you&apos; re starting him back even Steven, but you&apos; re not and you can hold that stare all day long if need be. &quot;Hate stickers 
bearing a so-called flag of some country that doesn&apos; t exist and never will exist have been stuck up in public places, in violation of 
both local and Federal law. People of color, especially Hispanics, are being subjected to an atmosphere of ethnic intimidation that 
causes them to feel apprehensive, and creating such an atmosphere constitutes a violation of their civil rights and as such is also a 
very serious Federal offense. But I won&apos; t go on. I think you know what I&apos;m talking about, Shane. Y ou&apos; re young and perhaps you 
don&apos; t understand that this kind of behavior is not only illegal, it&apos; s just plain wrong, a betrayal of every principle the U.S.A . stands 
for. Right now A merican soldiers are giving their lives for this country all across the world in order to preserve our A merican 
freedoms, and for anyone to abuse that freedom in order to give aid and comfort to terrorism and to undermine pubhc policy is 
disgraceful. It&apos;s not going to be tolerated, Shane, really it&apos;s not.&quot; He paused expectantly. 

I wasn&apos; t too worried at that point. I knew that if they actually had anything on me or Rooney or China Wingfield, who was in 
Dundee High by that time, tiien none of us would have been called in for a chat. We would have simply been hauled away in 
shackles. Carter had drummed the Five Words into us all long ago, the only five words that you ever, ever say to the ZOG police 
or any other kind of interrogator. No name, rank, and serial number, no chit-chat, no mouthing off, no attempt to lie or play 
games. Nada, zip, zilch, sweet Fanny Adams. Just the Five Words and the Five Words only. &quot;I have nothing to say,&quot; I said. 
It didn&apos; t throw Special A gent G oldberg, who had obviously heard it before, although Sorels made a growling mutter under his 
breath. Goldberg actually laughed merrily. &quot;Oh, dear, dear me. Y ou have no idea how very weary I am getting of that imbecilic 
response. Y our ridiculous so-called Five Words. Some of you people chant them like a mantra. Y ou actually believe they will 
protect you, but they won&apos; t If only you knew how little you know. Oh, dear me, no no no no. Y ou&apos; 11 have plenty to say, young 
man. They always do. White racists are the weakest kind of criminal we have to deal with. Shane, do you know I can kill you right 
now if I want? All I have to do is to toss you into the Federal holding cell up in Olympia with a few very large homeboys, Shane, 
and for a carton of cigarettes you&apos; re dead as a piece of dog shit on the road. Or if I prefer, you will find yourself with a very bad 
case of hemorrhoids and a few interesting diseases. One night in my house, Shane, and you would have more to say than you can 
even think of now. Fortunately for you, young man, I am in a good mood today and I am inclined to interest myself in your 
future.&quot; 

&quot;I have nothing to say,&quot; I replied, deadpan. 

Goldberg ignored it and drove on. &quot;Shane, I think you can help us with our present line of inquiry, and if you wisely decide to 
cooperate, then the Bureau is prepared to help you out in return. I believe in the philosophy of one hand washing the other. Now, I 
didn&apos;t just call you in here because I pulled your name out of a hat. I&apos;ve investigated your background, and despite that little slip- 
up in the third grade with the Fernandez kid, I don&apos; t think you belong with these people. I think you&apos; re a good A merican at heart 
who just fell in with the wrong crowd. Hey, it happens. I think basically you&apos; re a good kid who&apos; s caught some bad breaks, not the 
least of which are a white trash mother and father who never met a bottle they didn&apos; t like, but those bad breaks don&apos; t need to 
become permanent. Y ou&apos; re still young enough to turn your life around and I think you&apos; re smart enough as well. If you can come to 
understand where your duty to your country lies, then you&apos; 11 find that also happens to be the side your bread is buttered on. The 
Bureau can be very generous and supportive to those who help us out, son. Now, as I have said, we&apos;ve checked you out and I 
know you&apos;ve got some problems at home. Y our father has some health issues and he needs treatment, expensive treatment We 
can make that treatment happen, Shane. And while your Dad is getting well, we can get you into a good technical school and even 

A Distant Thunder 58 



one of several good universities this fall. Y our grades and SATs are not of the first rank, to be sure, but with the FBI greasing your 
wheels all kinds of doors that you might have thought closed to you can slide open. If your assistance here with our task force 
turns out to be of value and you agree to help us further wherever we think you might be of use, then you can get as good an 
education or better than you would have gotten under the G I bill, and you won&apos; t even have to do three years in the service to get it. 
&quot;But first, we need to know all about this nasty little racist club of yours,&quot; Goldberg went on. &quot;We know it&apos; s organized by an ex- 
convict named Carter Wingfield and a teacher at this school named Morehouse, two men who came to Washington from out of 
state along with a number of others with the specific intention of causing racial trouble here, which I think is contemptible. We 
have known about this so-called Northwest migration for years, and I&apos; m glad to say that the government has finally decided to put 
a stop to it. In order to do that, we need someone who can act as a kind of secret agent on the inside.&quot; I wondered if he was going 
to offer me a secret decoder ring as well. &quot;You see, we don&apos;t just want to getWingfield and his racist clan, or should I say Klan 
with a K? The goal of the task force is to take these shocking events here in Lewis County and build a major Federal conspiracy 
case that goes all the way up to the top, so we can shut down this whole rotten shebang and put all these white supremacists in 
prison where they belong.&quot; I was about to remind him that the Party was not white supremacist but white separatist, but I kept my 
trap shut. &quot;That means that we have to find one littie thread, the right one, and pull hard enough on it for the whole thing to 
unravel. I want you to be that thread. If you play your cards right and give us a demonstration of good faith by giving us this 
Wingfield gang, then it doesn&apos;t have to stop there. Y ou can be made a full time asset and moved into other areas around the 
Northwest, while you get that college education I mentioned and even afterwards. Y ou can be our own Donnie Brasco in the white 
racist underground. Y ou&apos; 11 have an exciting and sometimes dangerous but fulfilling career, and above all, if you deliver the goods 
to Uncle Sam on these ignorant bastards, you can make money. A lot of money, Shane. Some of our top intelligence assets in the 
field of counterterrorism make over a hundred thousand dollars a year, plus expenses and perks. Of course, they&apos; re good producers 
and they work hard.&quot; Yeah, I thought to myself, so hard if they can&apos;t find anything illegal to hang on a white boy they just make 
something up. I had already met a few guys who were now in jail due to testimony from these hard-working professional ZOG 
stool pigeons. &quot;But they prove that it is possible to bring home some serious shekels for undercover work. In a very short time you 
can overcome your present handicaps and get yourself set up for life.&quot; I noticed that throughout the entire proceeding, Goldberg 
never once used the word &quot;informer.&quot; 
&quot;I have nothing to say,&quot; I responded. 

&quot;Now, didn&apos;t I tell you that wasn&apos;t true?&quot; chided Goldberg with a sudden grin that made him look demented. &quot;I think you may 
know Sergeant Sorels here? The lad here says he has nothing to say. Do you think he has nothing to say. Sergeant?&quot; 
&quot;I think he&apos; s got plenty to say,&quot; boomed Sorels. 

Okay, this was a dumb thing to do, but I was a punk kid and hey, a punk kid just has to mouth off sometime. &quot;Hey Sorels,&quot; I said, 
&quot;I heard something about you, and I&apos; m wondering. Is it true your dick is the size of a felt- tipped pen?&quot; Sorels said and did nothing, 
which if I&apos; d had a lick of sense I would have recognized as a terrible danger signal and made a break for the door. 
Goldberg sighed. &quot;That was a very silly and childish thing to say, Shane. Y ou are being disrespectful to Sergeant Sorels, which is 
stupid, but you&apos; re being disrespectful to me as well, which verges on the suicidal. Leon is a muscle, and I tell him when to flex. 
Flex, Leon.&quot; 

Sorels may have been muscle- bound but it didn&apos;t slow him down any. The ape was on me as fast as a striking rattlesnake and all 
of a sudden I was hanging upside down in the air. Sorels lifted me up with one hand like a doctor lifts a newborn baby, he was so 
strong, and I thought he was going to pile-drive my skull into the floor. Instead he turned me around facing away from him while I 
clawed at the air, grabbing at the table and chairs, and a moment later I felt the first crashing blow of the nightstick into the small 
of my back. My back and hips seemed to be exploding as if the muscles were tearing themselves apart in spasms of fire. I lost 
control of my bladder and pissed in my pants, but since I was hanging upside down it didn&apos;t run down my leg but down the front 
of my belly and chest, under my shirt, and over my chin and ears. Sorels continued to hold me upside down by the ankles with one 
hand, and with the other he beat me like a rug with his nightstick. &quot;Not in the kidneys again,&quot; ordered Goldberg. &quot;No permanent 
injury. Not today, any way.&quot; So what followed were a series of forceful, controlled taps on my elbows, my kneecaps, my belly, 
my balls, my ankles, and the soles of my feet which seemed to shiver my legs into splinters, even through my shoes. Then he 
dropped me onto the floor in a crumpled heap and gave me a bit of the boot. His spit-shined shoes had steel toes. It hurt worse 
than anything that had ever happened to me; I was convinced my bones were breaking and he was going to beat me to death. I 
howled like an animal. Needless to say, no one came to help me or even to investigate screams of agony coming out of a school 
administrator&apos; s office. So what else is new, white boy? By then everyone in America had internalized one of the primary lessons 
of living in a police state: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. 

There was obviously no point in proceeding further with our little tete-a-tete, so Goldberg and Sorels left me lying on the floor 
soaked in my own urine and a surprisingly small amount of blood. The FBI man stuffed his card into my shirt pocket as I lay 
stunned and broken on the carpet. &quot;Like I said, I&apos;m in a good mood today, so you can thank your lucky stars I am going to give 
you some time to think about things. I&apos;ve written a cell phone number on the back of this card,&quot; he said. &quot;Call me within 48 hours, 
Shane, and we&apos;ll make a date for you to come into the Federal building in Olympia. Then you&apos; re going to have something to say. 
Oh, yes, you&apos; re going to have so much to say! Don&apos;t try to run. If you make me chase you I am going to be very pissed off, and 
when I&apos; m pissed off then the Sarge here is pissed off. Y ou don&apos;t want to get the Sarge pissed off. No, no no.&quot; 
&quot;Y ou don&apos; t want to get me pissed off, punk,&quot; rumbled Sorels. 

A Distant Thunder 59 



Goldberg slapped me gently in the face. &quot;Don&apos;t try to disappear and you make that call, boy! Because if I don&apos;t hear from you 
within two days, I&apos;m going to come looking.&quot; 

I lay on the floor in the conference room in a daze, passing in and out of consciousness and in a fog of agony, for many hours. I 
vomited my breakfast and some blood, but fortunately I didn&apos;t choke on it. No one came into the conference room during the 
whole day. By the time I staggered to my hands and knees and crawled out the door I saw by the clock in the guidance counselor&apos; s 
office it was four o&apos; clock in the afternoon. I had missed a day of school and no one had even bothered to check on me. By then my 
brain was functioning again and I had belatedly realized that Rooney was in danger. No one was in the office. I used the phone on 
Mrs. Dorfman&apos; s desk to call Carter on his cell phone, which actually wasn&apos;t all that good an idea— they could have been 
monitoring the call— but I was dazed and still a little new at revolutionary life skills, so to speak. Carter answered and I gabbled 
out what had happened. &quot;Are Rooney and China okay?&quot; I muttered through swollen lips. 

&quot;They&apos; re fine,&quot; said Carter. &quot;China spied blue in the hall and she told Rooney and they both cut out after homeroom, and they&apos; re 
in a safe place. We&apos; 11 figure out what&apos; s going on. Now get out front of the school. I&apos;m too far away to pick you up, so I&apos; m calling 
91 1 and I&apos; 11 get you an ambulance.&quot; I managed to stagger out of the building and meet the paramedics on the front steps of the 
school. &quot;What the hell happened to you, kid?&quot; demanded the driver. 

&quot;Sorels,&quot; I moaned. They didn&apos; t say anything else, but loaded me onto their gumey and headed out to the ER at Providence 
Hospital where I was bom. I heard the driver on his radio calling in that he had a Sorels Special. Now, I will give the steroid- 
sucking son of a bitch this: he was damned good at what he did and as the administrator myself of more than one punishment 
beating as part of my duty to the Republic, I have to recognize and acknowledge a master craftsman when I meet one. In the 
emergency room I discovered to my amazement and that of the staff that nothing was broken or seriously injured. No bones, no 
internal organs bleeding, nothing. Just bruises and incredible pain. Sorels was an expert and as bad as it had been, I had to admit 
that all I had gotten was a taste. 

Somebody had called the police when I was admitted and told them they had a serious assault case, and a couple of uniformed 
Dundee cops showed up while I was being bandaged. &quot;Jeez, they really worked you over, huh?&quot; said the lead cop. &quot;Who did it to 
you, Shane?&quot; 

&quot;Y our former colleague Sergeant Leon Sorels,&quot; I told him in disgust. &quot;A nd don&apos; t pretend you&apos; re gonna do a damned thing about 
it. Y ou assholes never do anything about Sorels.&quot; 

The cop sighed. &quot;Leon&apos; s hanging out with that FBI task force now, isn&apos;t he?&quot; he asked me. 

&quot;Yeah. It was Sorels and some FBI agent named Goldberg,&quot; I replied. I almost said Jew FBI agent, but my PC filter was up. 
The two of them looked at one another and the older cop closed his notebook and put it back in his pocket &quot;I&apos;m sorry son,&quot; he 
said quietly. &quot;Truly, I am.&quot; Then they turned and walked out the door, but the lead cop turned and said, &quot;There&apos;s something else. I 
feel ashamed. Ashamed to be wearing this uniform and ashamed of this piece of red, white, and blue embroidery on my shoulder.&quot; 
I didn&apos;t see him again until a couple of years later, when he and I were both Volunteers and we spent a night together waiting for a 
tickle to go down. There was never any legal follow-up of any kind on the assault against me. 

The nurse looked after them and made a face. &quot;That&apos; s Baxter and Wallace. They&apos; re not too bad, but that SOB Sorels sends us a lot 
of business and they can&apos;t do anything about it.&quot; (I met her too later on. Betsy Lamm, one of the best medics the NVA ever had.) 
The ER doctor was a Pakistani who wanted to admit me after wrapping my ribs and giving me a painkiller shot that made me 
really woozy. (I did not meet him later on in the NVA.) &quot;Y ou may have a concussion, oh yes,&quot; saysApu, and he might have been 
right, of course. &quot;We need to keep you here overnight for observation. What is your insurance, please?&quot; 
But just as they were loading me on the gumey to take me upstairs I heard Carter Wingfield&apos; s distant voice outside saying &quot;We&apos; 11 
take him home.&quot; The Paki tried to argue but Carter cut him off. &quot;No, we&apos;re not relatives, but we&apos;re the only people who give a 
damn about the boy. He doesn&apos;t have any insurance,&quot; and that settled that. Adam Wingfield loomed into the little cubicle, filling it 
hke some giant bearded medieval ogre in greasy overalls. He gave me a grim smile. &quot;Hey there, old hoss,&quot; he said. &quot;Looks like 
you done busted your revolutionary cherry. Y our first beating from the law. Sorels?&quot; 
&quot; Y eah, &quot; I said. A dam&apos; s eyes gleamed, and not in a kindly way. 

&quot;Y eah, I figured. I seen it before. I&apos;m getting tard of this mess. One of these days me and Mr. Sorels gone have a quiet word of 
prayer together,&quot; he said in a cold voice. A dam lifted me into a wheelchair like I was a doll, and as I was wheeled past the desk I 
saw Carter pulling out a roll of bills and paying the cashier the several hundred dollars in tab I had already mn up just for the 
ambulance ride and the ER. A few minutes later I was lying in the Wingfields&apos; darkened living room on the sofa with Ma slapping 
ice bags and slabs of raw steak onto my bmises and Rooney holding a glass of iced tea to my lips. 

&quot;Y ou don&apos; t understand,&quot; I told Carter. &quot;The Feds are after you! Never mind me, you guys gotta get outta here! Y ou gotta get the 
girls out of here. Carter! &quot; 

&quot;The Feds ain&apos;t anywhere near ready to move on us yet,&quot; Carter assured me. &quot;If they were they wouldn&apos;t have been leaning on 
you.&quot; 

&quot;How do you know?&quot; I gasped. 

&quot;We know, Shane. They&apos;ve been watching us, yeah, but we been watching them too, and I don&apos; t mean just the people you know. 
There&apos; s more of us Party boys around and about than you know. Don&apos; t sweat it. Now tell me what happened, from the beginning.&quot; 
I did. A fter I &apos; d finished C arter went off to make some calls and M a went off to fix me a big plate of everything in the refrigerator. 
Rooney was left sitting on the coffee table by the sofa. She looked at me, and tumed my head to face her. 

A Distant Thunder 60 



&quot;That day on the square, that day you didn&apos;t walk away from me when I was in trouble, that was the first time you stood up for 
me, Shane,&quot; she said softly. &quot;This is the second time.&quot; Rooney leaned over and I got my third kiss on my battered lips, which 
brought my average up to one kiss per year of our acquaintance, and every one of them worth a king&apos; s ransom. More, because no 
king could ever have commanded what she gave me freely. 

Later that night after I had been stuffed with enough food to feed a pack of wolves, there was a knock on the door and some 
muffled conversation. Carter came in and asked me, &quot;Shane, some of our people have come down from Olympia to talk to you 
about what happened to you at school today. They&apos;re from the Third Section.&quot; I knew the Third Section was the Party&apos;s 
counterintelligence wing. Y es ma&apos; am, I&apos;ve seen the Threesec movies and the televid series on TV as well. One of my long- 
standing favorites. Even back then there was already a kind of legend developing about the Third Section, a reputation for style 
and panache and making bad things happen to bad people. After Longview Third Section morphed into BOSS andtheWPB. &quot;You 
feel like talking to them?&quot; 

&quot;Sure,&quot; I said. The Third Section team turned out to be not secret agents with trenchcoats but an elderly man with a Southern 
accent who wore a casual windbreaker and the Party fedora, and with him was his tall, equally senior but still attractive and 
elegantly dressed wife. I saw the butt of a big .357 Magnum in a shoulder holster sticking outof the man&apos;s jacket They didn&apos;t 
give me any names and I didn&apos; t ask for any. With Three Section more so than the rest of the Party, you didn&apos; t ask. They sat down 
and cheerfully accepted iced tea from Ma while I painfully sat up in one of the Wingfields&apos; armchairs. The man quickly and 
skillfully ran me through the whole episode, once, then again. He took no notes, but somehow I understood he didn&apos;t need to. 
Then he turned to Wingfield and said, &quot;I don&apos; t think you have anything to worry about. Carter, but best to keep this young feller 
out of the way for a bit, and your girls as well. I have been known to be wrong.&quot; 
&quot;Nothing to worry about?&quot; I demanded. &quot;They&apos;re after us all!&quot; 

&quot;They&apos;ve been after us all for years, Shane,&quot; said the Third Section op. &quot;I know that to you this is probably the worst thing that 
ever happened to you, but the fact is that Goldberg has probably already forgotten your name, as hard as that is to believe. He does 
about five of these gigs per week. That&apos; s his style. He gets some local thug like Sorels and he beats or bribes people until 
somebody cracks. This is Goldberg&apos;s standard operating procedure. Hell, it&apos;s the FBI&apos;s standard operating procedure. He goes into 
an area and draws up a list of anyone he thinks might be potentially useful as an informer, then he offers them money and beats 
the crap out of them. He probably would have had Sorels rough you up even if you&apos; d taken his offer of cash, because he likes to 
use both the carrot and the stick. By beating and coercing as many people as possible he inevitably finds some who are weak 
enough to break, and every now and then one of them actually has something to tell him. Shane, despite almost a century of hype, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation are the most completely incompetent secret police in history. The FBI couldn&apos;t find the men&apos; s 
room without a wiretap or an informant, and even then they&apos; d have to offer him full immunity and the Witness Protection 
Program. They are politicized from top to bottom and so overloaded with affirmative action female and minority employees, so 
top-heavy with managerial chiefs and fewer and fewer Indians, that they can barely function. Goldberg was telling you the truth 
about wanting to build a conspiracy case that can bring down the whole Party. He&apos; s ambitious. But he is chained to a legal and 
political system that is archaic, complex to the point of incomprehensibility, overextended, underfinanced, confused and quavering 
with senility. The courts are so backed up that it takes years for even the simplest of cases to come to trial. Do you know why we 
haven&apos; t all been rounded up, arrested and charged under the Patriot Act of 2001, Shane? It&apos;s because they can&apos;t afford it. Every 
last penny the empire brings in has to go into maintaining America&apos; s occupation armies in the Middle East in order to stave off the 
destruction of Israel for one more year, and every Patriot A ct case costs a minimum of twelve million dollars per arrestee. That 
means Goldberg&apos; s bark is way, way worse than his bite.&quot; 
&quot;His bite ain&apos;t too shabby,&quot; I muttered, feeling my tender ribs. 

The old man nodded grimly. &quot;Y es, I know this is very hard for you to wrap your mind around in view of the fact that you&apos; re 
sitting there with Leon Sorels&apos; bruises on your body and feeling the pain, but what happened to you is the lashing out of a dying 
Beast, Shane. Y ou gave Goldberg nothing but the Five Words, which was exactly the right thing to do. In fact, it&apos; s probably all he 
expected. He knows you won&apos; t break without more effort than he&apos; s probably willing to put in, and he&apos; 11 go in search of easier 
prey. If he had been serious about flipping you as an informer, then he would have used a lot more finesse. They do have 
informers of course, and they could probably round up every Party person in Lewis County right now, sure, but they no longer 
have the necessary resources to follow through if they did. Goldberg and the United States Attorney in Olympia have a set budget 
approved by the FBI and the Attorney General for this so-called civil rights task force. Our information is that budget was as thin 
as a strand of spaghetti to begin with, and it&apos; s now exhausted. I doubt there will be any indictments at all for the horrific hatecrime 
of spray- painting Tricolors on walls. The whole so-called civil rights task force was just window dressing, some sound and fury to 
satisfy the local Chamber of Commerce types that the government won&apos;t allow their cheap Mexican labor supply to be interfered 
with. ZOG simply has too many fingers in the dike, Shane, and everywhere they turn around, another leak springs forth.&quot; 
&quot;So what do I do about this demand to call him in 48 hours?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Stay low for a week or so in case I&apos;m wrong,&quot; the old guy advised me. &quot;The same for your girls. Carter. Then just go back to 
school like nothing happened. My guess is nothing will happen. Goldberg will simply write you off as too tough a nut to crack and 
move on. He does that whenever he meets resistance. As with all bullies, the best way to deal with him is to stand up to him. I 
doubt he has even made any official record of your so-called interrogation, since failure doesn&apos;t look good on his sheet. If you 
guys don&apos; t want to trust my guess then I can dig it, no offense taken. The Party can arrange for you to be taken in somewhere else, 
Idaho or Oregon or Montana. But I honestly don&apos; t think it&apos; s necessary.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 61 



The woman suddenly spoke up. &quot;Shane/&apos; she said gently, &quot;Please don&apos; t take offense, but I would like to ask you something.&quot; 

&quot;Y es ma&apos; am?&quot; 

&quot; W hen G oldberg offered you medical treatment for your sick father, were you at all tempted to take him up on it? K nowing that 

your father may well die if he doesn&apos;t get some financial help for his medical expenses, and soon?&quot; I didn&apos;t ask the woman how 

she knew that 

&quot;The Bible says we have to honor our parents,&quot; I told her carefully, knowing that Ma was listening. &quot;I have a duty to my father, 

and if there was any way I could help him without betraying anyone else, I would. But the Wingfields are my friends, and one of 

them. . . well, they&apos; re my friends, and I won&apos; t save my D ad at the cost of betraying them. My D ad is my past, as horrible and 

disrespectful as that sounds. This family here is my present and my future, and I have to live in the present and look to my future 

and make my choice on that basis. I know you probably won&apos;t understand that... &quot; 

&quot;We understand more than you think, Shane,&quot; said the woman sadly. &quot;We have a daughter, and many years ago she had to make 

such a choice.&quot; 

The man spoke, ruminating. &quot;Not a bad choice so much as... &quot; His wife looked at him. &quot;Well, she made a strange choice. Life can 

be very strange, sometimes. Never mind, I&apos;m blathering. Keep your head down for a few days and let&apos; s see how it plays out.&quot; 

It turned out that the man from Third Section was right. I hung around in the back room of Johnny Pill&apos; s convenience store for a 

couple of days until I finally got bored and said to hell with it and went back to Dundee High to enjoy what was left of my school 

days. I ended up walking across the stage in my gown and mortarboard that June with the rest of my class, and getting my 

sheepskin. I think I&apos;ve still got it around here someplace. I didn&apos;t Goldberg again for a long time. Sorels was another story, but I&apos;ll 

get into that in due course. 

One thing I should mention. A fter the old couple from the Third Section had each consumed a large slice of Ma&apos; s pecan pie with 

whipped cream and then left to go back to Olympia, I said to Carter with reference to the battle of Mariana, &quot;Looks like those two 

Third Section operatives are more grave than cradle.&quot; 

Carter grinned at me and said, &quot;Y eah, well, remember this night, young feller.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Y ou just met Matt and Heather Redmond.&quot; 

* * * 

When I graduated from high school, I had a stroke of luck in the gainful employment department. The Party had managed to get a 
couple of hiring managers into two of the major temporary agencies in Olympia. Temp agencies were one of the biggest curses of 
the job market in those days, along with affirmative action and the Dees Act and Third World immigrant labor. They were one of 
the umpteen different ways that big corporations avoided what little was left of the country&apos; s already gutted labor laws. The 
multinationals who for one reason or another chose not to &quot;outsource&quot; their operation to India or Guatemala hired almost all their 
workers through the temp agencies, and so not only did they not have to provide any medical insurance or other benefits, but they 
could more often than not write off their labor costs as an expense for the purpose of what little taxes they paid. The temp worker 
was not legally employed by the place he worked for, but by the agency. He or she got a minimum or damned near minimum 
wage paycheck every week and that was it, and G od help you if you pissed off your client&apos; s contract manager who could cut you 
off at the knees and kick you out with a single phone call and no recourse. G od help you if you didn&apos; t get your ticket signed on 
Friday to slip through the little slot at the agency&apos; s office. Y ou were lucky if some Mexican foreman didn&apos;t demand a kickback for 
the signature that would let you collect your minimum wage. There were people in those days, like my father, who worked for 
years as &quot;temporary&quot; employees. That is, if they were lucky enough to work for an outfit decent enough not to let them go on the 
very week they were due to get what few remaining benefits were on offer through the temp agency itself. In some respects the 
slaves on antebellum plantations in the South had more rights. 

Temp agencies were also notorious for hiring illegals with only the flimsiest and most obviously forged documentation. Towards 
the end they didn&apos; t even bother with asking for a forged ID, because no one was enforcing the immigration laws any more. The 
contract managers in the agencies wielded immense power, since they decided who got called up for work and who didn&apos;t. It was 
a more sophisticated version of the old shape-up that crooked waterfront and construction unions used to run, except instead of 
some mobbed-up straw boss these contract managers were almost all young liberal girls who dressed like Barbie dolls and were 
given the power of economic life and death over men and women old enough to be their parents or even their grandparents. The 
ZOG always found such women to be the most malleable and conformist tools for the creation of their new, mindless managerial 
class. Raised in a society that was completely amoral to begin with, and indoctrinated from birth with feminist ideology and all 
kinds of subtle social engineering to hate men in general and white men in particular, these girls could usually be relied on to toe 
the official line. 

But one thing ZOG never did quite figure out was that not all white women were dumb broads, and that some of them had sense 
enough to see through the propaganda, to understand that white men weren&apos;t their enemies, and to understand who really were 
their enemies. Some white women even proved it by joining the Party, and we were lucky enough to work two of them into the 
hiring positions at TopStaff. What this meant was that as long as it didn&apos; t get too blatant, politically incorrect white males had at 
least some access to bottom rung employment, which is a situation ZOG definitely discouraged. It was essential to the continued 
operation of the system that any white male who resisted or whose mind was perceived to be incompletely under control be 
outcast, a pariah, consigned to the homeless shelters and the homeless encampments beneath the underpasses and in the parks and 
national forests. And eventually to prison, of course, when desperation and hopelessness pushed him over the edge. I don&apos;t know 

A Distant Thunder 62 



what the hell I would have done if I hadn&apos; t had Sheny Cahoon at TopStaff, who overlooked the glaring red flag with the &quot;special 
pre-employment reference to U. S. Attorney General&apos;s Human Relations Commission required&quot; that popped on all my computer 
credit and background checks the agency ran. The Human Relations Commission was the government bureaucracy in charge of 
maintaining and enforcing the blacklist Without Sheny I probably would have ended up collecting aluminum cans for recycling 
all day. She&apos; s passed on now, but before that I used to see her at Old NV A A ssociation reunions sometimes. One of her sons 
became the first commander of the Landfall colony on Mars, and one of her daughters became a well-known actress who 
specialized in female NVA Volunteer roles on Northwest TV. The daughter claimed in an interview I read that she used her Mom 
as a model. She had a good one. 

Not that the pickings were all that great even with Sheny as a fairy godmother in my comer. The American economy had been 
mismanaged and looted by the Anglo- Zionists for almost a century, and the bill was finally coming due. The last few years of 
ZOG there was negative economic growth in America for the first time since the Jamestown colony&apos;s first winter, and no one 
really knew what the real unemployment rate was because the government had classified the information as a national security 
secret I do know that the year I graduated it was leaked into the media that no n- governmental employers in the United States now 
employed more foreigners living outside the United States than American citizens. About all Sherry could do for me was place me 
as a warehouse mule at the Mighty Mart distribution center in Olympia. To be fair, that contract did pay ten dollars an hour, and 
that was about as good as anyone with my background was going to get under any circumstances. 

I started at Mighty Mart the month after my graduation, when most of the guys in my class were rolUng into various military 
installations on buses and getting their buzz cuts and getting kitted out for basic training. The job was simple: hump, hump, hump 
them trucks, stack them pallets, and do not let the word union so much as pass your lips or you&apos; re out on your ear. Unload the 
trucks and toss that freight onto the conveyor, haul them pallets on a jack hither thither and yon. If you could drive a forklift that 
was twelve to fourteen bucks an hour, but those jobs were in the hands of the few actual direct Mighty Mart employees who 
worked in the warehouse. In some cases forklift jobs actually handed down from father to son on the father&apos;s retirement Every 
forklift had a huge red, white, and blue Masonic dishrag sticker on it of course. I did three shifts a week, twelve hours on and 
twelve hours off, which gave me 36 paid hours per week, four short of the necessary forty hours to give me the coveted full-time 
status and therefore entitlement to the few anemic benefits which the law required the temp agency to provide after working for 
them for a year. In the course of each twelve hour shift I got three ten- minute breaks and one half- hour lunch, the bare minimum 
required by law, and I had to clock out for them, so I was only paid for the eleven hours I actually humped. The work was hard, 
repetitive, mind-numbingly boring, and spirit crushing. The warehouse was murderously hot in the summer when I started, and by 
the time I left to go on the bounce it was just starting to get bitter cold. Most of the foremen and team leads and most of my co- 
workers as well were Asian coolies who spoke no English, or else Mexicans who delighted in lording it over the gringos, a few 
kids like me who for one reason or another were 4-F for the army along with a scattering of broken, middle-aged drunks and sad 
sacks. Of course everyone was always stabbing each other in the back trying to get hired on permanent with the company, so you 
could at least get some very rudimentary benefits and a wee bit more job security than us temps had. 
There was an upside, of course. The three days on, four days off schedule left me plenty of time for Party activity, and that 
summer the action was definitely picking up. I think we all understood that things as they were couldn&apos; t last and that A murrica 
was headed towards some kind of crunch. &quot;I know that doom-saying rightwing cranks have been predicting imminent disaster 
since 1950, but I just get the feel that the whole ball of wax may finally be about to come apart,&quot; Red Morehouse told the 
Chowder Society. &quot;No society can stand the type of stress and strain that the empire has been subjected to for the past two 
generations. At some point a straw will come along that will break the camel&apos;s back.&quot; We kept on meeting, and although we&apos;d lost 
a lot of kids to graduation and the army, we had some newcomers as well from Dundee High and the middle schools. I was still 
technically living at home, and I kicked in some of my pay to Mom and Dad to keep them in liquor and lower the static level 
about what was I going to do with my life, and don&apos; t you da re go and do anything stupid like getting married to that redneck 
female whose white- trash family you&apos; re always hanging out with. Y eah, right they were the ones to talk. Well, that was Mom, 
mostly. Dad seemed pretty much past caring, he was so sick. But the vibes at home were sufficiently unpleasant so that I actually 
spent most of my time at the Wingfields&apos; house, often sleeping on their sofa overnight 

The Party evidently agreed with Red Morehouse&apos; s assessment or more likely he agreed with the Party&apos; s assessment because that 
summer we began to intensify preparation to go completely underground. Red was spending a lot of time up in Olympia and 
Seattle, and when he came back he gave us regular updates from the Political Bureau briefings he&apos; d sat in on, including a few 
from the Old Man himself when he was in town, although that was rare since he was doing a lot of moving around in that 
eighteen-wheeler mobile command post The thinking was that we would be formally outlawed under the Patriot A ct within a 
year, which turned out to be an overly generous estimate. No one at that time anticipated what would happen on 10/22, but the 
assumption was that an incident of some kind would be created by ZOG and used as an excuse for the United States Attorney 
General to ban the Party and a number of our adjuncts and front groups as domestic terrorists or sympathizers thereof, and then 
conduct a general roundup and ship us all off to the concentration camps at Guantanamo Bay and out in the Nevada desert. The 
result was that there was a lot less spray- painting and leaflet littering, and a lot more acquisition of property, vehicles, weapons, 
ammunition, canned goods, medical supplies, tools, maps and books and specialized computer and electronic gear. There was also 
an increase in revolutionary expropriations to pay for all these things, although our bunch in Lewis County was not involved in 
anything like that So many people were getting desperate that another few robberies here and there barely made the papers. We 
were busy setting up safe houses and apartments, establishing codes and E&amp;E procedures, setting up underground printing 

A Distant Thunder 63 



presses and computsr senders, training ourselves in everything from field medic skills to woodcraft acquiring vehicles and sets of 
false IDs, and drawing up lists and plans and blueprints on people and things in Lewis County that served ZOG and kept the 
Zoggish system in power. People and things to make go boom in the night. 

I suppose I should also mention, briefly and reluctantly, that certain of our erstwhile &quot;comrades&quot; suddenly stopped coming around, 
and in some cases disappeared permanently. We had always assumed that we had informers in our midst and acted accordingly, 
insofar as it was possible to do so and still take care of business, but no revolutionary movement can function in an atmosphere of 
total paranoia and we simply had to get on with things. An informer must behave in a certain way or else they don&apos;t fulfill their 
function, so with a little calm and rational observation it really wasn&apos;t all that hard to weed them out early on, so long as we didn&apos;t 
lose our cool and start seeing spies under every bed. The general rule was that unless and until we had some specific and concrete 
grounds for suspicion we took everyone at face value, and that actually worked pretty well. We didn&apos;t speak about such things and 
I was never called upon to be involved in anything like that; it was done by specialists from Third Section. Also, to be clear on 
this, I need to mention that many years afterward I ran into a man who had vanished during that summer and whom I had always 
assumed was moldering away in a hole somewhere in the mountains. It turned out that the Party had ordered him to another part 
of the Homeland for a special job and that was where he ended up fighting his war. Did we get rid of all the government spies and 
agent provocateurs in our ranks? I regret to say, no. They were always there and they did damage right up to the last, sometimes 
terrible damage, but when the government that hires the informers is itself corrupt, confused, top-heavy with incompetent 
managers and quavering with senility, then a strong and vigorous movement of dedicated and disciplined rebels can still triumph. 
As we did. 

That summer we also assembled and issued our hoarded arsenal of guns and ammunition, appointing reliable quartermasters and 
getting our weapons cleaned, zeroed, and distributed, which was a dangerous thing to do owing to the Schumer Act and more or 
less constituted our crossing of the Rubicon even before 10/22. Once we were caught passing out guns and ammunition and 
explosives that was pretty much all she wrote; the Feds would have had their excuse and we would have had to fight anyway. 
Contrary to present day misconceptions, the Schumer Act did not outright ban all private possession of firearms. The Second 
A mendment to the United States Constitution was never formally revoked, it was just nullified by six decades of legalistic salami- 
slicer techniques that sliced away Americans&apos; gun rights thin slice by thin slice, and by Federal courts on up to the Supreme Court 
itself that simply pretended the Second Amendment didn&apos;t exist. The Schumer Act hedged private gun ownership around with so 
many restrictions that if you did have a gun you tripped over your own shoelaces every time you tried to use it or transport it and 
more often than not you had to turn it in just to insure your own legal safety. 

Needless to say, any weapon heavy enough to be actually used in resisting tyranny was banned, including all semi-automatic 
longarms, called assault weapons, of all the moronic terms. A weapon by definition assaults people. A Iso any rifle capable of 
being fitted with a scope. (A &quot;sniper&apos;s rifle&quot; they called those, which is almost as absurd. Any long gun a marksman uses is a 
sniper&apos; s rifle. Did these people ever even think about some of the imbecilic terminology they used?) Y our gun had to be 
ballistically fingerprinted with a test slug and a paper trail of ownership matched to the fingerprint maintained, which was the back 
door ZOG finally used to bring in nationwide registration. Y ou couldn&apos; t legally own more than twenty rounds of longarm 
ammunition and before you could buy another box of twenty you had to bring in twenty spent cartridge cases. Y ou could not 
reload or own reloading equipment due to &quot;safety considerations&quot; in order to &quot;protect the children.&quot; (This from a regime that 
practiced kidnapping of young children for profit.) The gun had to have child safety locks, and in some localities they were 
electronically monitored so a signal went off at the local copshop if the lock was opened and so you had to call ahead of time and 
let the cops know why you were unlocking your gun. Y our ammunition (all twenty rounds of it) had to be stored in a stainless 
steel safe which was sometimes also programmed to alarm the police when it was opened, so forth and so on, blah blah blah 
ishkabibble. Not to mention the special local property taxes which cities and counties were encouraged to slap onto privately 
owned guns which made them more expensive to keep than your car. Y ou had to have a written police permit which cost $25 a 
time to transport a weapon to and from a shooting range or hunting trip, etc., etc. The whole purpose of all this nonsense was to 
make gun ownership completely ineffective as a method of home defense, and so annoying and so risky— every year hundreds of 
white people slipped on some legal banana peel or other and went to prison on gun charges— that it simply wasn&apos; t worth the 
hassle of owning one, so why not sell your guns to the police on a buy- back program and get some badly needed cash to pay those 
blood- sucking credit cards? 

Like all good Southerners the Wingfields were gun lovers, and like millions of others they had been violating the thousands of 
state and Federal gun control laws since before I was bom. So too had a number of native- bom residents of Lewis County. We 
were always big hunters in the Northwest, and resistance to gun control laws was one of the few acts of mass civil disobedience 
whites ever engaged in. They didn&apos;t have the balls actually to use the guns, but at least they kept them hidden away to take out 
now and then, stroke, and fantasize. It was the same problem that the govemment experienced when they tried to ban liquor 
during Prohibition and dmgs later on. Guns are fun, and if something was fun. White Americans were going to do it. The fact is 
that despite a few heroic historic examples, during the War of Independence the NVA seldom had to raid police stations or 
military posts for weapons. Despite the draconian punishments, there were still an amazing number of guns around, as the Federal 
thugs from It Takes A Village found in Idaho on 10/22. All kinds of people had dozens of guns stashed away or hidden in closets. 
The problem with revolution in white America was never any lack of weapons or munitions; it was that white people had the 
courage of rabbits. The Old Man always said that when we finally put some iron in our hearts, we&apos; d have no trouble putting some 
iron in our hands. Nor did we.

Carter and the boys had several places way out in the hills or right down on secluded beaches up and down the coast where they 
went to shoot. Y ou&apos; d be amazed how well pounding surf can cover gunshots, especially when the local people and even the local 
cops are gun fanciers themselves and look the other way. I always figured that a lot of the people who heard those shots in the 
distance had a good idea of who we were, and wished us well. I can&apos;t count the happy Saturday afternoons I spent during my high 
schools years down below the cliffs on the sand and the rocky shores, popping away at various floating targets with handguns and 
picking off seagulls with a .22 rifle, or deep in some misty mountain valley in a blind with Adam or John Hunt waiting to bag a 
deer that we&apos; d then field- butcher and pack ourselves to take home to Ma. Then Carter would make venison sausage meat and 
carve the carcass up into steaks and cutlets and roasts and we&apos; d be eating it all through the winter. At those sessions I was taught 
how to clean, load, handle, and fire everything from a 9- millimeter pohce- issue Clock automatic pistol to a full- auto M-16 Adam 
had smuggled back from the army. I was taught how to reload ammunition and gun safety, and I was taught as much of the 
practical aspects as could be taught under such restricted conditions, fire and maneuver, rifle squad tactics from A dam, etc. 
One of the things we did when we went out shooting was to play Little Willie, which is of course the most popular marksmanship 
game in the Republic nowadays. There&apos; s all kinds of variations today, everything from military versions in fighter simulators to 
the comer shooting gallery for kids where they still use the cartoon characters, but basically they all involve shooting at Little 
Willie when he peeps out from behind the lawyer&apos;s briefcase. Sometimes Little Willie is a yellow dog, sometimes he&apos;s a pig, 
sometimes he&apos; s a little white nigger. We had one of the better Little Willie sets of any of the Party units in our area. It was a long 
mechanical railing with armor- plated figures of a judge with his gavel raised on the shooter&apos;s left and a computer monitor on the 
right. Our Little Willie, the yellow dog version, would not only peep out from behind the lawyer and his briefcase, he would 
scuttle back and forth to hide either behind the judge or the computer, and the object was to hit him. What this was, of course, was 
a target selection and fire control training exercise, which later came to be very handy when we were actually shooting at real live 
yellow dogs who were trying to hide behind things. 

I knew the Wingfields had a fair amount of guns and ammo stashed, most of which I had played with at one time or another, and I 
never asked where they kept it, until one day in August I went into their bam and saw what must have been four or five hundred 
weapons and enough ammunition in boxes, crates, and belts to have made a moon crater if it had gone off. There were also cases 
of dynamite and some OD green ones marked &quot;grenades&quot; Carter gestured me to a bench. &quot;Y ou see that line there?&quot; he said, 
pointing to a series of longarms propped up along one wall. There were some M- 16s and AR-180s, several Ruger Mini- 14s, one 
old CI M-14, a Steyr, a beautiful bolt-action Enfield .303, a sporterized Model 1898 Mauser with a scope, a Remington .243 also 
with scope, a Fabrique-Nationale 7.62 semi, and a couple of AK-47s and old Chinese SKSes that from the battered condition of 
their stocks looked like they had been dragged across liie Hunan mountains by a whole generation of People&apos; s Liberation A rmy 
draftees. On every table were stacked enough handguns to have supplied the Capone mob in Chicago for the entire decade of the 
1920s. &quot;I just dug them up. They&apos;re still in cosmolene from storage. We need to get them cleaned and in firing condition. Hop to 
it.&quot; For the next two days I rodded cosmolene out of barrels, cleaned firing pins and bolt assemblies with steel bmshes, and then 
lightly oiled every piece with military- issue LSA which had most likely fallen off the back of a Humvee. We test- fired the 
weapons with blanks while Rooney and China revved pickup engines in case anyone was skulking around the neighborhood 
listening, and when the fumes got too bad for us to take. Carter turned up a bluegrass CD on the boom box and we test- fired to the 
sound of Bill Monroe wailing Blue Moon of Kentucky. 

At discreet intervals cars and tmcks and vans pulled up and people I&apos;d never seen got out. They had a quiet word or two with 
Carter or Red off in a comer, were given a selection of weapons and some ammo boxes and bags, and left for points unknown. 
What we were doing was a departure from normal procedure, since the NVA never stockpiled weapons in any quantity, and it let 
me know we were expecting something big. If you have a big weapons stockpile that means you can lose it all in one fell swoop if 
someone rats or slips up. The way to make sure that an insurgent force is always properly armed is to issue the rebels their own 
weapons and make them responsible for their safe keeping and their serviceability. I later learned that the huge arsenal I&apos; d seen at 
the bam had come from over fifty separate small hidey-holes and had taken Carter and the boys a week to collect Carter had been 
one of the Party&apos;s primary quartermasters and armorers, which he had never mentioned to me. But then I had no need to know. 
This inventory was a necessary risk. We had to get the guns into the hands of our people and we had to make sure the weapons 
were operational before we did so. 

More importantly than any physical preparation, though, we were being prepared mentally and spiritually for the beginning of 
armed stmggle. You should understand that from the very beginning, the Party had grasped Lenin&apos;s dictum that a revolution is not 
a tea party. In fact, we were just about the first white racial nationalists who did understand that since the Reconstmction Klan, 
unless you want to count the brief and glorious episode of the Order in the 1980s. Before we could know where we were going, 
we had to know where we had been. Red Morehouse was absolutely great on Movement history. W e would meet in our usual 
haunts in the W ingfields&apos; bam or living room or in the homes and basements of other Party members, and he ran it all down for us 
in session after session as he explained to us what was coming, where we had screwed up in the past and why we could not, dare 
not screw up again. It&apos; s impossible for me adequately to describe or explain the tension and the sense of anticipation at these 
meetings during that long hot summer. We all knew something big was on the way, something that would change our lives 
forever. I&apos; 11 give it to you as best I can remember after seventy years. 

&quot;Genuine politics is about one thing,&quot; Red told us time and again. &quot;It is about the acquisition and exercise of power. Everything 
else is political hobbyism, a luxury which the wealthy landed gentry of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who created liberal 
democracy in this country and in England could afford, but which a race like ours which stands on the verge of extinction cannot. 

A Distant Thunder 65 



We are about to enter the world of realpolitik, as the Germans call it. Power, all state power without exception, is in the final 
analysis founded on one basis.- armed force. Rehgion, constitutions, civil laws, propaganda, custom and all the various social 
institutions for reinforcing acceptable behavior, i.e. submission to authority, all these things have their place in any state&apos;s social 
structure, but without the ultimate sanction of the bayonet they are meaningless. A 11 state power, without exception, is initially 
acquired through armed force or through the imminent threat of armed force. All modem states, without exception, were originally 
brought into existence by men who fought for power with weapons in their hands.&quot; 

&quot;Not leaflets?&quot; interjected someone with a chuckle. &quot;Not tapping on a computer keyboard? No Committees of Correspondence?&quot; 
&quot;No, Mike,&quot; said Morehouse with a smile. &quot;No Committee of Correspondence is worth a bucket of warm spit without the Minute 
Man&apos; s musket No committee ever started a revolution except insofar as it concerned itself with the details of carrying out armed 
struggle. Power becomes accessible to revolutionaries when the existing order loses two vital assets upon which the maintenance 
of any government depends. The first element is the at least passive and tacit consent of the governed, and the second is credible 
monopoly of armed force. When the revolutionary movement has both the will and the capacity to commit acts of armed 
insurrection against the state, and does so with impunity, i.e., the perpetrators are not caught or punished, then the state has lost 
the credible monopoly of force which is the foundation of all political power. There is then an alternative, a real choice, because 
persons other than those sanctioned by the state are exercising power over the lives and destinies of others. 
&quot;Now don&apos;t get me wrong. Propaganda and persuasion are equally necessary. Hearts and minds is not a meaningless catchphrase. 
Our tactical objective must be for the Party to displace the ZOG apparatus of rule by force as well as by transferring the consent of 
the governed to itself through persuasion and propaganda. Both persuasion and coercion are necessary in order to carry out a 
successful revolution. Neither element alone can succeed without the other. All the propaganda, all the popular support and all the 
legal activity in the world are useless if the state can always fall back on armed force to maintain itself and physically destroy the 
opposition when it becomes too uncomfortable. On the other hand, a revolutionary movement without propaganda, without an 
ideology, with no purpose other than the pure seizure and exercise of power, are nothing but political gangsters, hoodlums with 
guns who wave a flag to justify common thuggery. We need to watah that in our own coming struggle, comrades. We don&apos;t want 
to end up like the Provisional I.R.A . on whom we will be modeling so much of our strategy and tactics, and degenerate into mere 
Mafia- like racketeers preying on our own people. But there are moral as well as political reasons for us to look forward to the 
coming struggle,&quot; he concluded. &quot;Everyone holds us white boys in contempt, and why shouldn&apos; t they? We don&apos;t kill our enemies, 
so why should anyone fear becoming our enemy? What kind of race or nation doesn&apos;t pick up a weapon to defend their country, 
their women, their elderly, their children, their very existence on earth? We deserve contempt for the way we have behaved since 
1945. It&apos; s time that white men recovered ourself-respectand the respect of those who hate us. And it is a long-standing human 
truth that respect among men is earned by the shedding of blood.&quot; 

We had no idea how or when the balloon would actually go up. It&apos; s odd that for almost three quarters of a century we used that 
term, &quot;When the balloon goes up.&quot; I think we all envisioned some gigantic apocalyptic event that suddenly changed everything 
from top to bottom and made all things possible where nothing had been possible before. None of us had any idea how it would 
happen. A sudden explosion of race war? A total economic collapse with rioting in the streets? Invasion by the Chinese? Some 
ecological disaster that created zombies who shambled through the streets moaning for brains? Flying saucers landing on the 
White House lawn? No one knew. 
And then, by God, it happened.

On the morning of October 22 I was just coming off the rdght shift at Mighty Mart, and I was weary from twelve hours of 
hunping big cardboard cartons of plastic cr^ rrade in Hong Kong off trucks and onto conveyer belts. I pulled out of the parking 
lot at the Olynpia distribution center a little after six, heading south to beat the rroming rush hour traffic as the sun rose, and 
looking forward to rry coming four deys off. At about the time Gus Singer looted out the window of his house in Coeur d&apos; Alene 
and saw the body-arncred Federal goons of It Tates A Village coning for his children, I was driving down Interstate 5 in the 
battered old 1999 Toyota Corolla I had bought from Adam Wingfield for a hundred doUars and which we had then rebuilt 
together That car looted lite cr^ on the outside but it ran lite a top under the hood It was a beautiful, crystal clear autumn 
rroming, one of the many that give the he to the popular legend that westem Washington is alweys grey and rairy . I remember 
feeling oddly contented and h^py, because the rdght before, while I hurrped the Jews&apos; trucks and hauled their freight around that 
big huge freezing cave, I had decided that despite rating only three kisses in three years I was going to grab hold of Rooney 
Wingfield sometime that dey, wrestle her to the ground if need be, and ask her to marry me. 

We were both out of school for good and we knew it. White kids like us weren&apos;t going any further, so why not get on with life&apos; s 
big ticket items? By now I considered myself a naturalized redneck, and in her culture and her family marriage between two 
eighteen year-olds was by no means out of the question. In fact, I had heard both Carter and Ma say that people ought to get 
married young because it kept them out of trouble. I didn&apos; t know if that was a hint aimed in my direction, but my thinking 
matohed. Hell, until the revolution came I had nothing else on my plate except humping in Mighty Mart&apos;s warehouse, and having 
Rooney to come home to in a trailer of our own on mornings like this sure would lighten that load. I figured she wouldn&apos;t say yes 
right away, but I was fairly sure where I stood with her. I knew there wasn&apos; t anybody else on the horizon, anyway. If there had 
been she would have let me know. That was another rare thing about Rooney. Y ou could trust her, and for a white woman of that 
time and society, that was unheard of. She never played the kind of stupid head games most white girls played. I figured if I faced 
her head on and asked her point blank what it would take to make her my wife, she&apos; d tell me straight up, and I was willing to do 

A Distant Thunder 66 



whatever she told me it took. I didn&apos; t fully buy into the Wingfields&apos; religion, nor have I since, but I went to their Sunday morning 
prayer meetings whenever I could because I knew they liked it and because I liked being with them. It wouldn&apos;t be a problem on 
my end, and if they wanted me to get dunked in the river and have my sins washed away or whatever, that was jake with me. 
I turned the car radio on as I drove back to Dundee on that fine cool morning, but either the morning shock jocks hadn&apos; t picked up 
on the news of the horrible racist doings out of Idaho yet, or else maybe the government was still keeping a lid on. I found a 
country music station playing oldies and I even remember the song that was playing when I pulled up in the Wingfields&apos; yard. It 
was John Conley, The Old School. It&apos;s about a poor boy who goes steady in high school with some rich Barbie Doll cheerleader 
type like Jill Malloy, but she dumps him after graduation to go to college and marry rich, and he ends up pushing eighteen wheels. 
&quot;I got married to a sweet young girl. ..and kept driving for the line.&quot; The cheerleaders had always ignored me and Rooney 
couldn&apos;t exactly be called sweet, but I felt it was on target. As I got out of the car, suddenly I was struck with an idea. Truck 
drivers still made reasonably good money, and there were a lot of husband and wife driving teams. Maybe that was a future for 
Rooney and me if we both got our CDL licenses. I was sure Carter could find some way to get us a rig and something to load on 
it. We could take a long haul to Florida for our honeymoon. 

I had my own key to the house. It was seldom locked, yet this morning I had to use it to get in the back door. I yelled as I got into 
the kitahen but got no answer. It was unusual for no one to be there at this time of the morning, but not unknown. China might 
have headed out for school early and Rooney might have gone into town on Party or personal business, and Ma still helped out at 
Wingfield High Performance with the books and taxes and whatnot One thing I should have noticed at once, and which I would 
have noticed even a few weeks later after a taste of life on the bounce, was that the dogs were gone as well. Caprice hadn&apos; t come 
up and stuck her cold wet nose into my hand and Porterfoy wasn&apos; t lying like a furry lump in front of the fireplace in the living 
room. I rummaged around in the refrigerator and heaped up a huge plate of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and grits which Ma 
had left for me like she always did every morning. I slapped the food in the microwave, warmed it up, poured myself a cup of 
coffee from the pot which was still warm albeit turned off, something else I should have noticed. I sat down at the kitahen table 
and started eating. 

A bout the third bite, I looked up at the fridge and I saw the note piimed on the door with a Tricolor magnet. It was written on a 
page that looked torn from one of China&apos;s notebooks and written in large red letters with a felt-tip pen. Shane, it read. Turn on the 
TV. It&apos;s already on CNN. Looks like the balloon just went up. Catch upon Coeurd&apos;Alene QUICK and then get your ass OUT OF 
HERE. Wedon&apos;tknow how fast ZOG will strike back, so don&apos;t spend all morning staring at the tube like a dummy. Call the 
Cookie Monster as soon as you get to a safe phone, not from the house. Take care. - Rooney 

Cookie Monster was one of Carter&apos; s multiple cell phones we hoped to hell they didn&apos; t know about. I later learned that all the 
Wingfield women and A dam had E&amp;E&apos;d about three minutes before I pulled up in front of the house. Like most Party people at 
the time, they had an evacuation kit ready. I had a small one that I kept at the house, but they&apos; d taken that one as well. I went into 
the living room and turned on CNN. I saw a street full of burning houses and a burning police car. There were fleeting glimpses of 
people running and ducking down behind things and firing; I couldn&apos;t even tell who they were. The camera shifted and I saw a 
dead man in body armor lying on his stomach, half on and half off the sidewalk, with bright red and orange and gold autumn 
leaves whirling around him in the wind and black smoke. The back of his jacket said FBI in bright yellow letters. Y ou could see a 
bloody hole in the back of his Bakelite helmet; the bastard had been running away when what goes around finally came around. 
The tag hne on the TV screen said Coeur d&apos;Alene, Idaho, Live in the lower left-hand comer. A Barbie doll talking head in the top 
right hand of the screen was babbling. I turned up the sound. &quot;Again, Roger, what we have so far is that according to an FBI 
statement, a team of agents and United States Marshalls acting on behalf of the U. S. Attorney General&apos;s Child Protective Services 
Division have apparently been lured into some kind of terrorist ambush, and the FBI in Washington D. C. has told us that several 
Federal agents have been killed and wounded. The Federal law enforcement team was attempting to serve a child protection order 
issue by a U. S. Circuit Court judge on the family of one Augustus Singer in Coeur d&apos;Alene when they came under heavy gunfire 
from the surrounding homes in what appears to be a highly disciplined and prepared terrorist attack.&quot; 
As history tells us, it was nothing of the kind. It was Gus Singer&apos;s neighbors, good Americans all who finally decided they no 
longer wanted to be Americans, good or otherwise. Ordinary people who said to hell with America. Slaves who in the hght of a 
Northwest dawn pulled their cherished guns out of hiding, and who at long last, for the first time since 1865, fired those guns at 
the hirelings of the United States. Ordinary and decent men and women who heard the call to heroism and answered it, who 
fought and died in an attempt to save the Singer children from being kidnapped and sold as chattels and toys to rich yuppies and 
perverts. That attempt failed, and the Singers died that their race and nation might live. But at the time I had no idea what the hell 
was going on. Neither did anyone else. For all we knew, the Party had decided to start the revolution without us. I disobeyed 
Rooney and stared at the tube for several minutes, trying to wrap my mind around it all, until the phone rang on the side table. I 
picked it up in a daze. &quot;Y eah?&quot; I said. 

&quot;Hello, darlin&apos;. No names on this phone,&quot; drawled Carter&apos;s voice. &quot;Little pitahers have big ears.&quot; 
&quot;Is it us? Is it us?&quot; I yelled. 

&quot;Don&apos;t know. The government says it&apos;s us, and that&apos; s all that counts. They&apos;ll be coming after all of us now. You need to get out of 
that house and over to the gym.&quot; 

&quot;Got it,&quot; I said. Needless to say, the gym was anything but a gymnasium. One of our people ran a franchise for a major shoe store 
chain in a local shopping mall, which included a capacious warehouse and storage area in the back. One of the best places to hide 

A Distant Thunder 67 



when you&apos; re on the bounce is in plain sight in the middle of as many people as you can find. We had all been provided with 
employee parking stickers in case of need. Mine was in the glove compartment of the Toyota Corolla. 
&quot;Wait don&apos;t hang up/&apos; said Carter quickly. &quot;Y ou know the rapture kits I made for this kind of sitch? My big boy got &apos;em out of 
the bam and got &apos;em mostly ready for you. He didn&apos;t do &apos;em up completely because he knew you&apos;d be coming into the house. 
They&apos; re under the sink. Y ou need to take care of that for me, son.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; I asked. &quot;It might turn out to be a false alarm. Y ou all might want to come back.&quot; 

&quot;Dead FBI lying in the street ain&apos;tno false alarm, no matterwho done itorwhy/&apos; Carter rephed grimly. &quot;We ain&apos;tcoming back. 
This thing in Coeur d&apos; Alene may be us, it may be some kind of staged incident like 9/11 to give ZOG an excuse to do us all in, 
who the hell knows with these people? But either way, our old lives are gone, son. We all knew we&apos;d have to move on someday 
soon, and we&apos;ve been trying to prepare everybody for that I&apos;ve got some good memories of that home of ours, your home too as 
we tried to make it, but an old time has ended today and a new one has begun. Do it I&apos;ve showed you how.&quot; 
&quot;Y ou got it&quot; I said, and I hung up. 

A major rule of urban guerrilla warfare: when un-assing an area, always booby-trap everything you possibly can. The reason for 
this is not so much to inflict casualties per se as it is psychological warfare. Y ou want to wrack the nerves of the man who&apos; s 
pursuing you and keep him on edge, never letting him forget that while he&apos; s hunting you, you&apos; re hunting him as well. A cautious 
enemy is dangerous. Y ou don&apos;t want him calm and cautious and deliberating. Y ou want to take him beyond cautious and way into 
paranoid. He needs to see you around every comer, behind every bush, never knowing when you will strike or how. Every 
moment of his day, ZOG&apos;s hired lackey needs to be sweating, wondering where Jerry Reb is, what he is doing. His neck needs to 
have a permanent itch from those invisible cross- hairs on it 

Booby-trapping everything in sight also has the effect of slowing them down to a crawl while they check out every nook and 
cranny for any unpleasantries you may have left behind. Time spent calling in the sniffer dogs and sweeping for explosives and 
manipulating clumsy handling equipment to open a door is time ZOG is not chasing you, time you are using to put distance 
between yourself and your last tickle and prepare for your next or even grab some much needed shut eye. Nor need you restrict 
yourself to pyrotechnics. Booby-trapping is fun and it allows you to get creative as you destroy. With a little practice we learned 
to open bottled beer, spike it with cyanide or sulfuric acid, and then reseal it so carefully that thirsty cops and Fatties breaking into 
one of our safe houses would pop the top and go for the gusbD, for the last time. (They knew we didn&apos; t allow alcohol in the 
Volunteers. I am amazed the idiots never wondered why there was beer in our fridge and never figured that one out but it worked 
more than once.) Then there was the old exploding crapper trick. The famous Dr. James Cord cooked up a little powder we&apos; d 
sprinkle onbD the surface of the water in bDilets or urinals which exploded when it came into contact with uric acid. We blew the 
family jewels off a Marine colonel that way once. My personal favorite was to booby-trap a picture of Adolf Hitler on the wall 
with a white phosphorus grenade set into a recess behind it When some red, white, and blue-blooded all-Amurrican boy ripped it 
down in righteous rage for Mom, G od, and apple pie, then he got a truly Herzliche NS-Grilsse. Cars were especially dangerous for 
Uncle Slime. It got to the point where they wouldn&apos; t even examine a vehicle they knew the NV A had abandoned. They&apos; d just back 
off and shell it with their grenade launchers. Not too good for collecting evidence. But I digress. 

I looked under the sink and pulled out the rapture kits, two OD green ammunition boxes, each one of which had a 9-volt battery 
attached to the side by an aluminum bracket and both of which contained a large shaped block of Semtex high explosive. On both 
batteries, one red wire from one terminal led directly to a debDnator cap inserted into one end of a stick of dynamite, which had in 
turn been inserted into a hole in the box and which would act as a larger detonator for the main charge. So did the blue wire lead 
to another debDnabDr cap at the other end of the dynamite. But the blue lead was really two wires, one attached to the battery 
terminal and the other to the blasting cap, connected in the middle of the strand by an alligator clip. The jaws of the clip were 
clamped down on a small patch of lead sheeting about an inch square and the thickness of a dime, and in the head of each lead tab 
was bored a small hole, through which was run a heavy thread, about eighteen inches long. At the end of the thread was a looped 
thumbtack. I carefully placed the first ammo box to the left of the front door, out of sight under a raincoat of China&apos; s I found, and 
firmly pushed the thumbtack into the door as low as I could so hopefully any Fed or cop trying bD ease the door open wouldn&apos;t see 
it Then I did the same at the kitchen door in the back. Anyone kicking open either door would then yank the little lead tab out of 
the alligator clip, complete the circuit and fly up into the sky bD meet Jesus. Hallelujah, brother! 

After I rigged up the rapture boxes I took a last check around the house to see if anything obvious had been missed. The only thing 
I could see was Chompus, whom I knew to be China&apos; s favorite stuffed animal from her childhood that she&apos; d hung onbD. Chompus 
was a threadbare, battered and faded green alligab)r in a sitting position, wearing a stupid grin and a purple tie that said South 
Carolina on it He struck me as an odd thing to be carrying into an armed insurrection against the United States govemment but in 
spite of her father&apos; s acute observation about an old time ending and a new one beginning, I figured Chine might want to keep at 
least that one thing from her past so I grabbed Chompus off her bed. Then I climbed out a ground floor window, got into my car 
and left the American part of my life behind forever. I knew whatever happened, I wouldn&apos;t be unloading any more trucks of 
plastic junk for the Mighty Mart 

When I got to the gym, i.e. the shoe store in the mall, I parked off to the side and scouted the place out first to make sure, going 
into the mall and scanning the few employment ads in the window of the useless Worksource job center. Nothing unusual seemed 
to be happening in the mall, no police or commotion, and the shoe store looked open for business. There was a crowd in front of 
Radio Shack silently watching a television in the display which I ignored. I sauntered into the shoe sbDre like I was a customer and 
ignored the middle-aged woman at the counter as I walked into the back room. But I was stopped by Tom Bumham, a teacher 

A Distant Thunder 68 



from Mossy Rock who jammed his pistol barrel in my belly before he recognized me. &quot;V m glad to see you came fully prepared to 
begin our struggle for racial freedom, comrade/&apos; he said somberly, nodding downward. 

I looked down and saw Chompus the stuffed alligator in my left hand. So much for my calm, cool and debonair revolutionary 
insouciance as I cased the lay of the land like a pro. I didn&apos;t even realize I had been doing my first recon while carrying a child&apos; s 
toy. &quot;There&apos; s secret microfilm jammed up his butt,&quot; I told Tom with a straight face. It was crowded in the back storeroom; there 
were at least forty people, including all the Wingfield family. Most of the people there I knew, or at least I&apos;d seen around, but 
some were unfamiliar They were gathered around a television set in the little backroom office, spilling out into the warehouse 
section, leaning against metal shelving and sipping on Styrofoam cups of coffee and canned soft drinks from a vending machine. 
There was a sliding glass window in the office which was open so we could all hear what was on TV . Somebody had hung a 
Northwest Tricolor flag up along the ceiling beams and the blue, white and green swayed over us, billowing gently in the draft I 
felt a cold, wet nose in my free hand and saw that Caprice was there as well. Glancing around I saw Porterfoy lying asleep on a 
bottom shelf like some big furry bedroom slipper I went right to Carter. &quot;What the hell is happening?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;White people are fighting ZOG in Idaho,&quot; said Carter &quot;I think it may be our people.&quot; He looked down and saw Chompus, and he 
said nothing. Not then or ever, but I think he understood, and I rose another notah in his estimation. 

I saw China in the press of people, went up to her, and gave the toy to her &quot;I didn&apos; t know if you wanted him or not,&quot; I told her 
She took the stuffed gator and said quietly, &quot;I was already down the road in the car when I remembered I had forgotten him. 
Thank you, Shane.&quot; 

Rooney appeared by my side. Her face was flushed and her green eyes bright with excitement. &quot;If s just rumor so far, 
unconfirmed,&quot; she said, taking my hand. &quot;But CNN says the Old Man is in Coeur d&apos; Alene! And Mom and Dad say China and I 
can wear jeans for the duration of the whole revolution!&quot; 

&quot;Red is trying to get hold of somebody out there to find out what&apos; s going on,&quot; said Carter For the next few hours we simply 
watahed, stunned at what we saw on TV. About noon Ma and Adam came in with arms stacked high with pizza boxes, the fruits 
of Lewis County&apos; s first act of revolutionary expropriation of the War of Independence. One of our guys was a delivery driver for 
the Pizza Palace, and he absconded with his entire noon lunch run of hot pizzas for the entire town of Dundee and delivered them 
to the rear loading dock of the shoe store, which gave us about thirty pies of various sizes and toppings, not to mention a number 
of plastic jugs of rotten sugary soft drinks and baskets of bread sticks and buckets of red sauce, which sustained the 
insurrectionary forces of the Rebel County for the first hours of the revolution. Fine with me; junk food or not, I liked pizza of any 
kind that didn&apos;t have pineapple on it. Dundee&apos; s yuppies went hungry that day, and we ate their lunch while we stared at CNN. 
A bout one o&apos; clock Red Morehouse came out of the comer where he had been dialing cell phone number after number, and he 
confirmed that the Party was involved in the revolt in Idaho. &quot;It seems to have started when Federal thugs from It Takes A Village 
tried to grab this guy Singer&apos; s children and the locals reacted by shooting at the Feds. Singer was an Old Believer although not 
affiliated with us in any formal way, but the Party has done the old carpe diem trick,&quot; he told us. &quot;Fortunately we had some men 
on the scene with some cop-on and some testicular foUication. The Idaho boys seem to have gotten tired of waiting, so they 
followed up on what the people in Gus Singer&apos; s neighborhood started. The leader of the insurrection appears to be Comrade 
Winston Wayne, who as some of you may be aware is one of the Walla Walla 43, the men who broke jail awhile back. The Coeur 
d&apos; Alene police station and government buildings have been occupied by the Party, and in addition to Party personnel several 
hundred local people have come in with whatever weapons they could scrounge up and have joined the revolt on our side. By a 
fortuitous coincidence, the Old Man was in Spokane at the time along with the whole mobile GHQ entourage. Some of our people 
jacked a chopper and brought the Old Man in, and the rest of General Headquarters has been relocated to Coeur d&apos; Alene by road. I 
have established contact with someone who in turn has contact with what&apos; s going on in CD A and so there is now a line of 
communication open between this unit and the center of military operations, and there is now an official chain of command. I have 
been informed that we should stand by for an important public statement from the General Secretary.&quot; 

Ma Wingfield alone among us dared to voice our hope: is this the day we become free men again? &quot;Is the Old Man gone proclaim 
the Northwest Republic?&quot; she asked bluntly. 

&quot; I have no idea, ma&apos; am, but I don&apos; t think he&apos; s going to sing hey nonny- nonny and a hot cha-cha, &quot; replied Red. &quot; ne more thing. It 
goes without saying that Winston Wayne and the fighters in Coeur d&apos; Alene need every bit of help they can get, and they are 
already calling for volunteers from the Party from around the Homeland. Based on my assessment of our present situation here, I 
am asking for six volunteers who will take two vehicles and the best of our weapons, go to Idaho, and try to get through to CDA .&quot; 
It was too crowded for anyone to step forward, but in silence every hand in the place went up, including mine and every member 
of the Wingfield family, including Ma. &quot;Thank you, comrades. I expected nothing less from all of you. Comrade Wingfield and I 
will make the decision as to who will go based on who has combat experience with the imperial forces in the Middle East or other 
relevant skills, and also on our own need to begin military and support operations here in Lewis County. Carter, could I see you in 
private?&quot; 

&quot;Just a minute,&quot; said Carter &quot;I need to take care of something.&quot; He beckoned to me and I followed him into a small loading dock 
area stacked with cardboard cartons of shoes and wooden pallets. &quot;Shane, we&apos; re going to be here for a while until we can get our 
ducks in a row and find our where we stand, but I&apos; m a bit nervous at having this many of our people in such a small space. By 
now the local cops will be on the lookout for those of us they know, and I&apos; m worried they will spot a bunch of our cars in the 
parking lot here, as big as it is and surrounded by other vehicles as they are. We&apos;ve got some contacts in the Dundee department 
and the Lewis County sheriff s office as well, whom I think we can trust to keep us posted on what&apos; s happening on their end, but 

A Distant Thunder 69 



until we can get dispersed I need sentries. I&apos;m sending the giris out into the mall to hang around the record bar and the Burger 

Shack and giggle like typical teenagers while they watch that side, but we need someone on the back as well. Keep the roll-up 

door closed, but you sit out there. Take a chair and sit just behind the dumpster, which will shield you somewhat from view but 

lets you see both entrances into the back parking lot. It&apos; s still kind of exposed, but we&apos;ve got to have some reliable eyes out here to 

let us know if any law is coming.&quot; 

&quot;How will I let you guys know if the cops do try to come in this way?&quot; I asked. 

&quot; Slip back inside if you can, but if they come in fast trying to do their dynamic entry shit you&apos; re going to have to cover down 

behind the dumpster here and hold them off as long as you can, make some noise, to give us time to escape and evade.&quot; I would 

also probably be killed, which I forebore to mention because I knew Carter knew it full well. 

&quot;Make noise with what?&quot; was all I asked. He opened a drawer in the bottom of a steel shipping and received desk and handed me 

one of my favorite weapons from his private collection that I&apos; d fired at our little impromptu training sessions at the seaside and up 

in the hills. It was a Chinese- made Tek-9 machine pistol knockoff, but quite well made and a lot more accurate than some versions 

of that weapon. It had interchangeable barrels up to ten inches, but Carter had already attached the shortest barrel, the five- inch 

one. Best of all, it had a selector switch that let me fire it on full automatic. It gobbled ammo like popcorn when I did that and the 

burst was short, but it was devastating, and with practice I&apos; d gotten some pretty good patterns with it at up to fifty yards. It already 

had one twenty-round clip of nine- millimeter rounds in the well, and Carter handed me two more magazines that I stuck in the 

back pocket of my jeans. He jacked a round into the chamber and put it on safety. &quot;Put it in your belt under your jacket and don&apos;t 

take the safety off unless you see something nasty coming. I know you&apos; re tired after working a full shift, son, but you&apos; re going to 

have to stay awake and stay alert.&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;m not sleepy, believe me,&quot; I said with a chuckle. 

&quot;Good. I am not totally out of touch with the cops&apos; minds here, and I don&apos;t think they really relish tangling asses with us, and not 

just because they&apos; re yellow like that motherfucker Sorels. Some of them are at least half-way sympathetic and we&apos; 11 need to figure 

out how to play on that. But if the police come in here in force and they attempt to enter this building, with or without weapons 

drawn, you&apos;re going to have to open fire on them and kill them if you can, because they are enemy soldiers and they will be 

coming to do harm to your friends and your country and your race. I know you assisted in Red&apos; s little legal problem a while back, 

Shane, but this won&apos;t be like killing a lawyer. These will be real people, men and maybe a woman of your own race, and they will 

be shooting back at you. If I didn&apos; t think you could do it, I wouldn&apos; t have called you out here in the first place. But there&apos; s no 

shame in not being a killer, Shane. Most people aren&apos;t. Nor does it mean you can&apos;t be part of the revolution. Kilhng is only a small 

part of what we have to do to get our freedom back. But this is it, son, the real thing is here, and if you already know in your heart 

that you can&apos; t pull that trigger on a man if you have to, then for G od&apos; s sake, tell me now.&quot; 

&quot; Y ou know darned well I &apos; d shoot anyone who tried to hurt Rooney in a heartbeat, &quot; I told him with a sullen scowl. &quot;A nd the rest of 

you too, of course,&quot; I added hastily. 

Carter grinned at me. &quot;I know it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I figured you at least deserved to be asked.&quot; 

So I spent the rest of that incredible day, the first day of the revolution, sitting on a padded swivel chair from behind the shipping 

and receiving desk, looking out over a half- deserted parking lot towards the rising hills of Douglas firs interspersed with golden 

and silver maples and aspens that whispered in the wind, sipping canned soda and chewing on cold pizza, alone with my thoughts. 

I was filled with pride not only in my comrades of Coeur d&apos; Alene, but in the trust Carter had placed in me. And I don&apos;t mean that 

he relied on me to shoot at a cop if I had to. I think he told the truth when he said he knew quite well I was capable of that. He 

didn&apos; t come out once to check on me, to see if I&apos; d suddenly come to my senses, realized what the hell I was getting involved in 

and beat feet out of there, jumped in my car and headed for California. He knew I wouldn&apos;t do that, and he trusted me with the 

lives of himself, his family, and all our comrades. That was a greater and better honor than any medal I ever got from the Party. 

He trusted me not to walk away. 

Around sunset the door opened and Rooney came out into the loading dock. &quot;Hey there, long, tall and evildoing,&quot; I said to her 

with a smile. &quot;Pull up a pew.&quot; Rooney pulled up an empty computer shipping box that stood beside the dumpster and she sat down 

on it It was reinforced inside with Styrofoam and so it took her weight &quot;Any news? What&apos; s going on in Coeur d&apos; Alene?&quot; I asked 

her. 

&quot;Looks like we ran the ZOG bastards clean out of town. There&apos; s Tricolors flying over the downtown and from church steeples. 

They did make one announcement We are now officially the Northwest Volunteer Army and we will be commanded by an as yet 

to be named Army Council and General Officer Commanding, most likely Winston Wayne since he started the ball rolling. The 

Old Man is supposed to go on TV and lay it all on the waiting world sometime soon. They may not even let us see him or hear 

what he has to say. Daddy figures ZOG will pull the plug on CNN and all the other media soon and embed all the reporters with 

the FBI and army or something so they can&apos;t report anything they ain&apos;t supposed to, and from then on all we&apos;ll get is official 

bullshit like every time they invade some little country somewhere. Seen anything out here?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Couple of deer, but they were too far away for me to hit &apos;em with this Tek-9. What did your Daddy give you?&quot; 

&quot;I got the Beretta.&quot; Rooney flicked back her sweater; she had on a shoulder holster rig. &quot;China got a .380 auto but no holster, so 

she&apos; s got to carry it in her school bag.&quot; 

&quot;Have they decided who&apos;s going to CDA yet?&quot; I asked casually. 

&quot;Adam,&quot; she said. &quot;I think Daddy too, although he hasn&apos;t said as much. I told Daddy if you went I was coming too. He told me 

I&apos;m a soldier now, and I&apos;ll take orders, but he wasn&apos;t mad about it I think he knows.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 70 



&quot;Y eah, he does/&apos; I said. She took my hand and I held hers in both of mine against my chest while I looked out over the parking lot, 
not daring to look at her. &quot;Roon, there&apos; s something I need to tell you/&apos; I said to her after a while. &quot;I was going to ask you to marry 
me today, before all this other came up. I know that&apos; s not possible now, but I figure you&apos; d like to know.&quot; 
&quot;I&apos;m glad,&quot; she whispered. 
&quot;What would your answer have been?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Y ou know what it would have been.&quot; There was more silence for a while. &quot;The Bible says it&apos; s sinful, but Shane, if this was a 
better time and place, and we had someplace to go, I&apos; d make love with you now. But it&apos; s too crowded in there, and it&apos; s too cold 
out here.&quot; 

&quot;Dem!&quot; I laughed. &quot;And besides, we&apos; re both on duty. But I appreciate the thought, Roon.&quot; I held up her hand and kissed it, and 
she settled her head on my shoulder, and we stayed that way for a bit. Then the door opened and Carter stuck his head out. &quot;Both 
of you come inside,&quot; he said. &quot;As risky as it is to have no sentries, I don&apos;t wantyou to miss this. The Old Man is coming on TV.&quot; 
ZO G &apos; s hand on the media plug was a bit slow in the pulling, and so the Old Man&apos; s speech from the Coeur d&apos; A lene television 
station slipped outjust under the wire before the United States Attorney General in D.C. invoked the Patriot Act and shut down all 
news coming out of Idaho. There in that darkening, chilly, dusty warehouse, surrounded by cardboard cartons of mostly cheap 
plastic shoes made in Taiwan and Brazil, littered with half-open pizza boxes containing only crusts and plastic soda jugs with a 
few fingers of drink left in the bottom, and with two sleeping dogs, our little band of brothers and sisters heard the declaration of 
our nationhood before the world. 

Since that evening, the Old Man&apos; s address has been printed in thousands of books and newspapers and on posters and in 
pamphlets. It has been carved on walls and monuments and memorized by millions of school children in the Northwest American 
Republic, so I will not repeat it all here. I can only give you the high points that stick in my memory from that very night itself, 
over seventy years ago. What was it like to hear those words for the first time, with the cold metal of guns pressing against our 
hips and weighing down our belts? With me gripping Rooney Wingfield&apos; s hand in mine? I cannot begin to explain or describe it. 
It was something that happens only once in... well, it doesn&apos;t happen very often. After the war we all remembered two events more 
than anything else from that time. The Old Man&apos; s declaration of the night of October 22&quot;&quot;*, and Cath^^ Frost raising the Tricolor 
into the bright aftEmoon sunshine at Longview, five years to the very de^ after that. Everything between is kind of one long mass 
of merrDiy, not much of it good, but it s anchored at both ends by the twenty- second dey of October I&apos; m sorry, rra&apos; arri, that s 
about as rraich sense as I can rriate out of it for sorrieone who wasn&apos;t there. A lotof us who were there for that first October 22&quot;&apos; 

wereri t there five years later for the second Including sorre who stood with me in the warehouse that night 

* * * 

&quot;In the name of Almighty God, in the name of a thousand generations past and a thousand more yet to come, the white men and 
women of America today resume control of our own racial destiny, seizing itback by force of arms from the tyranny of an alien 
race and their shameful hirelings of a corrupt and wicked government, who have cruelly and viciously abused our people, our 
laws, our culture, and our civilization. Trusting in divine aid and in the truth and justice of our cause, we proclaim the lands of 
the Pacific Northwest to be no longer subject to the authority or rule of the government of the United States. We declare that 
henceforth these lands shall be a sovereign and independent Aryan Republic, a Homeland and a refuge for all of the Aryan 
peoples of the earth, wherein all of the Children of the Sun, from every one of our scattered nations across the globe, shall live in 
peace and prosperity and dignity, free of all oppression and contamination of both the body and the spirit. In these lands we shall 
at long last secure the existence of our people and a future for white children... 

&quot;To our fellow white men and women, many of whom shall hate us and persecute us because you have been so cruelly deceived, 
we open our arms in love and forgiveness. Brothers and sisters, I implore you, in this wonderful moment let the scales at last fall 
from your eyes and let yourselves see the truth to which you have been so long blinded. Itisforyou that we fight, itis for your 
children and your posterity that we soldiers of the Northwest Republic will lay down our very lives without a moments hesitation 
or regret. In even the most degraded and weakened among you, you will find that the ancient fire of our racial spirit burns, 
however low the spark. Open your minds, open your hearts, open your very souls and let that spark of ancient pride and glory 
burn bright once again, as for countless centuries it burned so bright that it illuminated all the world... 

&quot;To the white soldiers and police of the American military forces who will be sent to crush us by the frightened, weak and corrupt 
beings who rule in Washington D . C, we say. there is more to life than a signed paycheck. There is more to honor. There is more 
to justice. Look into your hearts and you will know what is right. Many of you know already, but it is not enough merely to know 
what is right. Now you must DO what is right, however hard and terrible that decision will prove. Come to our sides, my brothers 
in arms, and bring with you the weapons and ammunition thatZOG has given you, that they might be used to redeem not only 
yourselves but all of our Folk from an unspeakable tyranny... 

&quot; To the people of color who now inhabit the Pacific Northwest, we say this: we do not blame you for coming into this land to take 
what is ours. Time and again, over more than one generation, we demonstrated clearly that we were not willing to fight for our 
land, nor for the wealth that we created, nor for the homes that we built, nor for the industries and things of beauty that we had 
made. Why should you not follow Nature&apos; s immutable law and come in your strength to pillage from a nation so weak and supine? 
In that, you have lived far closer to cosmic truth than we. We do not even blame you for seeking our white daughters, for they are 
the mostbeautiful of all G od&apos; s creation, and who would not want them for his own? But that time is over now. Let me put this as 
bluntly as I can: the boss man has come home. He has been long away, and while he has been away you have gained much from 
your looting of our land. Take it, be glad of what you were able to get, and leave! Leave now! Leave while the way is still open, 

A Distant Thunder 71 



before white men with weapons in their hands find you and take vengeance for the evil that you have done to us. There is nothing 

for you any more in this land. It is time for you to return to the many places whence you came. Leave while you still can... 

&quot;To the Jewish people, we say nothing. There is nothing to say. For you there shall be only endless night. 

&quot; To the governments and nations of the world, and especially to the government of Canada that borders on our own Northwest 

Republic, I will tell you flat out that this is a private fight. Do not make the mistake of helping the Americans in any way to 

oppress us or do harm to the Northwest Republic. If you do, you will be surprised at how long an arm we have... 

&quot; To my comrades in arms who now stand at my side, who have brought this day into being and who from tomorrow&apos;s dawn will 

resume the battle for our people&apos; s freedom, and to all of you who over the coming days will be joining the forces of the Northwest 

Volunteer army to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children, I say this: the hard part is now over. We 

have once more found in our hearts the ancient courage and hardihood of our race, and against the soul of the Aryan warrior no 

mercenary hireling can prevail. The lion has at long last awakened, and the only conceivable outcome to this battle is our total 

and final victory, and those now hearing my words in Washington D . C. know this. The United States will bluster and bully like it 

always does, the United States will swagger and boast, the United States will beat and bomb and butcher and torture the helpless, 

as it always does. But the United States has already lost, and they know it. Our hearts are no longer in chains, and now no evil 

empire with a hundred times the power of the United States can keep our bodies chained to their rotten, tottering tower of 

wickedness and corruption... 

&quot;Among our ranks there are some who practice the Christian faith, some who follow the old Nordic, gods of our race, some such 

as myself who believe in the new dispensation of Adolf Hitler and National Socialism which was given to the world in the middle 

part of the last century, and some who follow no god or gods at all but who feel in their hearts our people&apos; s destiny and role in the 

universe and will play their part in this struggle purely in the knowledge that it is right. I know that no one among you will take 

offense if in this historic moment I acknowledge the Christian faith of the Founding Fathers of the true America, and of the brave 

men of the Southern Confederacy who rose in rebellion in 1861 to defend that true American vision. For all of us, I therefore close 

my address on this night of nights with lines from the Forty-Sixth Psalm-. &apos;He breaketh the bow; He snappeth the spear in sunder. 

I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth, for the Lord of Hosts is with us.&apos; 

&quot; My friends, my comrades, my soldiers, my brothers and sisters, on this the first night of Northwest freedom, I bid you all good 

night.&quot; 

There was no cheering or excitBment; the whole warehouse seemed stunned and silent. Rooney&apos; s head was on my shoulder again, 

and she was crying softly. I put my arms around her, and it was a while before I noticed that I was crying too. A fter a time Red 

wiped his own eyes, stepped forward and spoke. &quot;All right,&quot; he said in a normal, conversational tone. &quot;You heard the boss man. 

Let&apos; s get this show on the road.&quot; 

TheFeds were getting their show on the road as well. That night they hittheWingfield place with a full SWAT raid. They came 

in screaming and cursing and threatening and waving their weapons in the air like they were real bad-asses. It was called dynamic 

entry, and it always worked great on doped-up crack houses and mosques in Baghdad and houses full of women and children who 

could be terrorized. This time their exit was even more dynamic than their entry. Two FBI sons of bitches were raptured and half a 

dozen more ended up in a badly dismantled condition. Washington&apos;s Rebel County inflicted its first enemy casualties that night 

L ast f A n A ncient Breed 

There is so little glory in a white man&apos;s life. 
He works hard for his money, and he takes a wife, 
But a white man&apos;s son can be a hero in the night, 

With a heart full of anger and a will to fight. 

Seize this moment in your hand! Take it and run! 

There is freedom in your mind, and you&apos;re loaded like a gun! 

Volunteers! Living out the fantasy! 

NVA is the best that we can he! 

Gonna make our stand, in this Northwest land , 

Like the last of an ancient breed... 

Like the last of an ancient breed . 

- Underground rock song, circa early 21** oaihiry 

So in an exalted and inspired ecstasy of revolutionary fervor, we all went charging out with guns blazing and brought the mighty 

United States of America to its knees, right? 

Actually, no. In that first confused year while we struggled to survive as a movement, the Army Council picked Lewis County 
clean of everybody they thought could pull a trigger, shipped them off to various active service units around the Northwest where 
the action was hotter, and the rest of us were organized as a support unit. We ended up with all of the danger and very little of the 
fun. War tends to be like that. There&apos; s always a shitty end of the stick and somebody has to grasp it. Later on it heated up for us, of 
course. Lewis County doesn&apos; t get to make that boast about being Washington&apos; s Rebel County for nothing. But at first we were 
very much a backwater. The action was mostly in Idaho and in the cities, Seattle and Spokane and Portland and Boise, where our 
actives would strike at ZOG and then melt into the mountainous regions and wilderness which surrounded most Northwest 

A Distant Thunder 72 



metropolitan areas. That&apos; s where we came in. Lewis County was conveniently placed and it was a very large stretch of turf. It was 
where active service units fled to after popping off a few rounds at ZOG in Seattle, Olympia, Tacoma, and sometimes Portland. 
The first thing Red and Carter did after the Old Man&apos; s speech that night was to sort out the six Volunteers who were to go out to 
Idaho and join the rebellion in CDA. They were Adam Wingfield as team leader along with his wife Leah, a Christian Identity girl 
he&apos;d married only a few months before. Leah was actually from that part of the world, the daughter of some early Aryan settlers 
who had come to Hay den Lake under Pastor Butler, and so she knew the Coeur d&apos; Alene area well. Another one selected was a 
Canadian kid named Danny Bondurant who was supposed to be good with explosives, as well as an older man named Sam 
Maxwell who was a former police officer from North Carolina and still pretty fit for a geezer, a guy named Bob Parsons who had 
served in Iraq and gotten a Purple Heart, and another guy named Willis who had been in the Marines but was kicked out for evil 
racismlike Adam had been booted out of the army. Carter Wingfield waste stay behind and help us get organized in Lewis 
County, which I was very glad to hear. The revolution wouldn&apos;t have seemed the same without him, and I knew Rooney and 
China and Ma were worried they might lose three family members instead of two if it went bad. 

The six Volunteers who were to march to the sound of guns were given one longarm each, M-16s and a Ruger Mini-14 and our 
one Steyr .50-caliber rifle with the armor-piercing bullets, plus their handguns and as much ammunition as they could get into the 
three vehicles they took, a case of grenades, and most of the money we had on us. I overheard Red and Carter briefing A dam. &quot;On 
the interstate you could be in CDA by dawn, easy, but stay off the interstate,&quot; Morehouse told him. &quot;There will be ZOG 
roadblocks as sure as God made little green apples. Once you get about fifty miles from Spokane, move off the main highways. It 
will slow you down, but given the general ZOG inefficiency I think you should make it through. This thing appears to be 
completely spontaneous and it seems to have caught Y ehudi with his pants down, and it&apos; s going to take them a couple of days to 
get their act together, get enough bodies up there and clamp down a blockade on the Coeur d&apos; Alene area. According to what I 
have been told by our people on that end, the plan is to try and keep old U. S. 95 both north and south out of Coeur d&apos; Alene open, 
and they recommend you try and swing wide on the cat roads either up towards Sandpoint or else to the south, so that incoming 
Volunteers will be met by NVA forces, processed in and assigned their units and military duties as quickly as possible.&quot; The six 
Volunteers left soon after, Adam giving his family a parting bear hug, including me. My ribs were sore the next day. 
I suppose before I go any further I need to talk about what happened to our little Lewis County expeditionary force. They made it 
through to Coeur d&apos; Alene okay, right up to the last twenty miles or so, when they had to shoot their way through an Idaho state 
police roadblock, but no one was hurt, at least not then. The story of the first Republic and the Sixteen Days has been told 
countless times before, and I won&apos;t re- tell it here, except that I always thought its greatest significance was that it showed us white 
boys still had the blood of heroes in our veins. Like the 1916 Easter Rebellion in Ireland, the Sixteen Days in Coeur d&apos; Alene were 
a glorious failure that inspired us to fight on to eventual victory so as to be worthy of our brothers and sisters who died amid the 
fallen leaves of orange and gold. Our guys from Dundee were in the thick of it. Willis was killed in the final assault on the central 
post office by his former comrades of the U. S. Marines. Sam Maxwell was wounded and captured and spent some time in a 
Federal detention camp, but he escaped and made it back to Lewis County, and got hooked up with Echo Company again. The 
other four broke out with Winston Wayne in the fighting retreat and ended up serving with him as part of the Sawtooth Flying 
Column. Two years later, Leah Wingfield was arrested doing a supply run into Boise. She was sent to Seattle and handed over to 
the FBI&apos;s Special Counter-Terrorism Task Force, i. e. my old buddy Bruce Goldberg. For the sake of political correctness 
G oldberg used some nigger bull dyke as his puncher for female prisoners, who didn&apos; t have Leon Sorels&apos; deft touch. Leah was 
beaten to death in her cell about a week after her arrest, but A dam never found out until after the Longview treaty. He and the 
other two spent the rest of the War of Independence with Wayne in Idaho, and he stayed there and got married again. He passed 
on a few years ago, but I still get Christmas cards every year from his children, and I send birthday gifts to his grandchildren. 
After our six disappeared into the night headed for Idaho, the next job was to get us all armed and dispersed out of that shoe store. 
I ended up on a team with the Wingfields, surprise surprise, and about midnight we moved to a mobile home in the woods outside 
Winlock which remained our base of operation for the next couple of weeks while things went down. It had a satellite TV which 
we kept on the news channels all the time as we watched the Sixteen Days unfold. We might have been emotionally devastated 
through the defeat of the first Republic and the eventual capture of the Old Man, but by then we were too busy fighting ZOG to be 
depressed. Even if it was only as a support unit. 

In the long run the Party and the NVA rejected the original idea of a centralized structure led by one General Officer 
Commanding— all other problems aside, if such an officer were to be killed or captured, the psychological damage to the cause of 
Northwest independence would have been unacceptable. The NVA adopted a very loose and informal and highly flexible 
organization structure that was a kind of combination of the Provisional I.R.A . and Cosa Nostra, the two most applicable models 
from the previous century. We were never a mass movement like Adolf Hitler had been able to build in Weimar Germany, 
because the conditions were completely different, although you&apos; d be amazed how long it took some of us to understand that, 
including the Old Man himself. 

Very loosely described, the Volunteer forces during the War of Independence consisted of three kinds of fighters. There were the 
active service units, the gunmen and guerrillas who actually engaged the Federal forces in combat Of these the largest and most 
flamboyant were the Flying Columns of song and story, although they didn&apos;t really get going well until the next summer after 
10/22. There were the support personnel of every kind that kept the active service units functioning and fighting by keeping them 
supplied with food, ammunition, medical supplies, money, accommodation, vehicles, intelligence on enemy movements, 
propaganda backup, clothing and equipment. Support people also continued on with a lot of the very same low-level propaganda 

A Distant Thunder 73 



activities that we had done before 10/22; I think I went on as many spray-paint and nocturnal leaflet distribution runs in the year 
after the Coeur d&apos; Alene uprising as I did in the year before. Only this time tossing leaflets on lawns carried the death penalty and 
we were carrying guns. The kind of leaflets we were distributing were also of more importance, since most of them were notices 
from the NVA advising the population of various things the Party and the Army wanted them to Imow. Historically, there is no 
question that the majority of people who ended up wearing the Northwest independence medal served in a support capacity as 
opposed to an active service unit, and quite a few of them never fired a weapon at a cholo or a Feeb during the entire five years, 
which is no shame at all. We couldn&apos;t have won without them. Support cadres took the same chances as the gunmen, sometimes a 
lot more since they had to live and work within the belly of the beast, and when captured they ended up with the same electrodes 
wired to their balls and the same cyanide needle stuck in their arm as active service unit shooters with twenty ZOG notches on 
their guns. 

Finally, there was a third kind of NVA activity, mostly run by the appropriately named Third Section set up and run by Matt and 
Heather Redmond, that old married couple from North Carolina who had interviewed me in Dundee the night Leon Sorels beat the 
crap out of me in school. Threesec did things that were coordinated on a national level by General Headquarters such as 
intelligence and counterintelligence, propaganda, computerized warfare, and the political and diplomatic echelons that directed the 
whole course of the war. A whole James Bond world of shadow warfare conducted all across North America and the world, and 
those Third Section guys sure as hell did get up to some heavy and romantic activity. Some of these definitely tended towards the 
spectacular and legendary, hke the wide-ranging active service units in New Y ork City and Washington D.C. who damned near 
shut both cities down and inflicted billions of dollars of economic damage on ZOG. The Threesec computer boys and girls pulled 
off all kinds of coups from periodically spamming every single e-mail address in the country with NVA propaganda, to computer 
viruses that destroyed whole government and corporate networks, to running phony government websites, to hack jobs into the 
most closely guarded Federal databases that gave us vital intelligence such as lists of FBI and FATPO informers among our ranks. 
G eneral Headquarters itself was thankful for the excellent practice in nomadic life they&apos; d gotten in the year before the CD A 
rebellion, trundling around the Homeland with the Old Man stashed in that eighteen-wheeler, because GHQ had to move almost 
every week. General Headquarters was even located in Lewis County on two occasions, or at least sections of it were. Once the 
A rmy Council met for several days in the gingerbread and flower-garden Victorian home of a little old lady in Dundee who sat on 
her porch doing needlework and babbling like a senile dingbat, while she kept an Uzi on the chair beside her covered with a hand- 
knitted shawl which I happen to know she was entirely capable of using to deadly effect. The second time was during the last 
months of the war when the Political Bureau took over the upstairs floor of the public library in Centralia; today there is a little 
memorial plaque on the outside of the library and the stairway has the original &quot;closed for remodeling&quot; sign that was stretched 
across it when the last negotiations leading to the Longview conference were being completed on the floor above. 
An actual organizational table of the NVA would be almost impossible to assemble with any degree of accuracy, because it 
changed form and structure and components almost like a lava lamp, through death and arrest and the constant need to make a fast 
break out of an existing structure and into a new one, one step ahead of Z G . V ery roughly, it went like this: G eneral 
Headquarters consisted of whatever staff officers and members of the Army Council weren&apos;t in jail or out on operations at the 
time. The Old Man was in prison, but even from his cell he was able to get occasional authenticated messages to the troops in the 
field, like the directive to strike at the enemy&apos; s financial base by halting tax collection and dismantling the Internal Revenue 
Service. GHQ set overall strategy and policy with a view towards winning the independence of a sovereign Aryan Republic in the 
Northwest GHQ then told the active service units what that strategy and policy was through the Political Officers assigned to each 
unit, who then worked with the unit commanders in the field to implement it. That&apos; s the way it worked in theory. 
In practice, it was an unholy mess. In a general way, we had our mission. Get rid of ZOG and anyone who supports ZOG, and 
that&apos; s what we did. We assumed that in the absence of ZOG our political and military strategy would work itself out and the whole 
of society wouldn&apos;t just collapse into chaos, and it turned out we were right Any kind of hands-on micromanagement from GHQ 
was simply out of the question: we were the ones sitting in the bushes at night with the guns in our hand waiting for somebody to 
walk by who needed shooting, and we pretty much made the tactical decisions. There were occasional exceptions, of course, like 
the Samuel Rothstein hit that came down directly on orders from the Army Council with Pat Brennan sent to take charge, but 
generally speaking the A SUs were told what the political leadership wanted accomplished, and they accomplished it however they 
could on the local level. We thought nationally and acted locally. It was kind of like putting together ajigsaw puzzle. GHQ 
showed us the cover of the box so we knew what the whole picture was supposed to look like, and then we tacked and pounded it 
together with whatever pieces we could find. If the pieces didn&apos;t fit then we did some trimming. 

Communication was very compartmentalized, because it was a weak link, a thread that the Feds could pull on and start things 
unraveling. I&apos;m already mentioned that you rarely knew a fellow Volunteer&apos; s real name or where they laid their heads at night 
The only reason I myself knew the names of as many as I&apos;ve mentioned so far is that I was in the Party and I met them before 
10/22. This way, most of us who were arrested by the Feds had very little to tell, which as I myself was later to learn was a vitally 
important tactical asset for us. The only vertical contact so to speak, that the combat squads had with GHQ was through the 
Political Officers, and so a PO was always considered a prize catch by the Feds, with the biggest prices on their heads. At one 
stage they were offering $250,000 for Red Morehouse. Carter had $100,000 on his head. Me and Rooney and China and the boys 
never rated anything more than the standard $50,000 DT or &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; bounty. The Feds dreamed for five long years of 
that one big raid that would wipe out GHQ and cripple the NVA, which wouldn&apos;t have happened because GHQ itself was split up 
into geographically separate teams, but never mind. The only contact most active service units had with other crews besides their 

A Distant Thunder 74 



own support people was through the company&apos; s executive officer. In theory, anyway. I know Tank Thompson had his ways of 
getting hold of Terry Jackson in Longview and Mike Koltsov in Tacoma directly, and others if he had to. Of course he was also 
married to E Company&apos; s executive officer. There were in fact cases where ZOG managed to pull on the one thread like Goldberg 
had described to me and roll up an entire company, but that didn&apos;t happen often. Usually by the time they worked their way 
outward from one Volunteer who broke under torture or was bribed, the company had upped stakes, broken up, changed locations 
and safe houses, etc. 

Within the company, NVA Volunteers were broken down into teams of between three to six people, enough to fit into one vehicle 
if necessary, although as I have mentioned before, we usually took two cars wherever we went. A team would get an order from 
the CO or X to be at a certain place at a certain time and do a specific job, and it was up to the team leader to work out the 
details. For the first nine months or so, Lewis County didn&apos;t even have an active service unit as such until Tank Thompson came 
up from northern Cahfomia and was given command of Company E, South Sound Brigade. Adam Wingfield would have made a 
goodCO, buthe was inldaho. We thought that CarterWingfield should have gotten the CO slot, but he turned it down on the 
grounds that he had no actual military experience and he was better at support stuff anyway, gun-running and car stealing and 
things like that, so he ended up as quartermaster until he moved up and became quartermaster for the whole South Sound Brigade 
and his slot in E Company was taken by Smackwater Jack. 

Now, about all those swashbuckling adventures we supposedly occupied our time with in the Northwest Volunteer Army. 
BuU...sheeeeeeet! 

There has been an incredible amount of nonsense written and broadcast about the so-called romance of life on the bounce with the 
NVA, staying one step ahead of ZOG all the time, shooting it out in choreographed ballets of flaming gun muzzles and flying 
cartridge cases, with little mandolins and perhaps a cape, as I remember from somewhere. If you believe some of these movies 
and lurid books that have been put out since the war, it was all one long joyride of daring commando raids on ZOG, car chases, 
cloak and dagger skulduggery in smoky dens of iniquity, one- on- one duels with villainous FBI agents in deserted warehouses 
(with something throwing out steam, of course) and general swashbuckling, with frequent interludes of getting it on in picturesque 
hideaways with beautiful guerrilla girls wearing bandoliers of bullets, berets, and nothing else. Y eah, well, I had my own guerrilla 
girl and she&apos; d sure enough made me an offer that once, but we also had one or both of her parents within sight at all times, and if 
not them her little sister, which combined with the fact that people were hunting us and trying to kill us kind of put a damper on 
the whoopie. Oh, I suppose it does look romantic and exciting for somebody looking in from the outside who&apos;s never had to do it 
in real life. A lot of history does. I always thought I would have liked to sail with Columbus, but I imagine the smell of those 
wooden ships alone would have put me off, never mind the food and the sanitation. I can tell you that living history is a different 
story altogether, a large part of the problem being that you don&apos;t know how it&apos;s going to end. The people who admire you and who 
are so fascinated by it all seventy years later know how it all ended, but back then you don&apos; t, and you never know when you wake 
up if you&apos; 11 ever sleep again or you&apos; 11 be dead in a day or an hour or a minute. The Chinese used to have a curse against their 
enemies: &quot;May you live in interesting times.&quot; Well, we lived in an interesting time, and the novelty of it wore off fast, believe me. 
It was rough even after we had worked out a more or less live and let live arrangement with the local cops, and all we had to 
worry about was Feds. Life on the run from the law is always a very high- stress existence even for those of us who got an 
adrenalin rush out of the whole thing. Y ou live on black coffee and whatever crap food you can get hold of out of fast food 
restaurants and cans. Somebody always has to be on guard duty and you never really sleep, you&apos;re so on edge wondering if the 
door is going to come crashing in and you&apos; re going to die in the next few minutes. Every time you step outside your safe house 
you&apos;re inviting a catastrophe, and if you stay holed up you know they&apos;ll find you, and they&apos;ll shell you with artillery to dig you out 
if they have to. Even something simple hke doing laundry or grocery shopping becomes a major military maneuver, complete with 
posted sentries, planned escape routes, code names, false ID and pistols stashed in the dirty socks. We moved around a lot, at night 
whenever possible, and we seldom stayed in one place for more than a couple of days. We hid and plotted by day and we struck 
by night, and then we bolted for a new hideout, sometimes leaving the old one booby-trapped for any inquisitive Feebs if we 
thought they&apos; d tumbled to it. 

Fortunately for us, western Washington is a large place and there were huge expanses of territory, especially in the eastern parts of 
Lewis County, where the population was very sparse and which were ideal for lying doggo. If Sasquatch could hide for 
generations in those forests ttien so could we, in any isolated trailer or cabin or house or bam we could find. A lot has been made 
of the Flying Columns allegedly camping out under the stars, and sometimes they did, but even the Flying Columns were very 
seldom all out on active service at once. Roughing it is never fun when you have to do it. Our comrades from the Columns liked to 
sleep in a bed with a roof to keep off the rain as much as the rest of us, and they usually found one. From the very beginning ZOG 
never had much real control of the Northwest outside the cities and the towns, and towards the end not even there. They simply 
didn&apos;t have enough loyal cops and soldiers to make their presence felt in the huge rural areas of the Northwest, and so we pretty 
much always had a warm dry roof over our head and some place we could run to. That&apos; s one reason that the Northwest had been 
selected for the Homeland back in the 1970s. There is no way in hell we could have succeeded in establishing our own country for 
white people if we&apos;d tried it in some little landlocked enclave or in a small area like New England, where ZOG could have 
concentrated their forces in large numbers. 

Mobility, mobility, mobility and hit! hit! hit! Our primary tactic was to keep on the move and keep kicking ZOG in the teeth. &quot;This 
is more a battle of mind and will than it is of weapons and equipment and people,&quot; Red told us. &quot;Think in terms of attack, people, 
never defense or concealment except insofar as these things are necessary so we can attack again! Bum this into your mind: we 

A Distant Thunder 75 



are the hunters, not the hunted. We are not running from ZOG. ZOG is running from us!&quot; We were never idle, always planning 
the next attack or planning to meet the enemy&apos; s counter- sweeps. We never really had time to sit and think about our situation. If 
we had, common sense would have dictated that we run like hell and never come back, but we never did. 
Our main concern was that we never allow ourselves to be pinned down, in a house or a compound, because once we were trapped 
without any escape route, ZOG could bring its&apos; crushing, overwhelming force to bear. We had learned the lessons taught to us at 
Waco and Ruby Ridge in the 1990s. We learned early on never to give the bastards time to track us and a stationary target so they 
can break out the tanks and the napalm. The first rule of the NVA was to stay light. Live light. Stay mobile. Be ready to re-locate 
on three minutes&apos; notice. W e knew we were headed for the fires of W aco or burial alive in the GULAG if we let ourselves be 
trapped. Move fast, hit hard, and then move faster. Avoid any routine or discernible pattern in our travels which might be deduced 
by a sharp detective or extrapolated by a computer. 

Another thing we learned from those small but bloody encounters in the 1990s was that when confronted with determined armed 
resistance, the Federal government would back off. Not back down, but back off and circle around, and look for some way to 
come in at us to where they wouldn&apos;t get hurt and would live to collect their pensions. When confronted with direct resistance, 
rather than immediately apply overwhelming force to overcome a challenge to the authority of the state, the power structure pulled 
back and started waffling, looking for the line of least resistance, developing scenarios, analyzing options, trying to find an easy 
way out, trying to put a &quot;spin&quot; on things. The mark of a weakening and increasingly confused Beast, a Beast that was fatally 
indecisive. The Federal forces of repression could not take casualties. Its hirelings fought for pay, and when the time came to lock 
and load they would go to almost any lengths to avoid being hurt. They were real good at shedding the blood of people like the 
Weaver family and the children at Waco, but to the average FBI agent, his own hide was sacrosanct and he wasn&apos;t going to risk 
getting it perforated with bullets if he could at all help it. One of the problems inherent in employing a mercenary army is that the 
mercenaries tend to want to survive to enjoy that monthly salary check, that affluent lifestyle, and that comfortable retirement. 
They are highly reluctant to go the extra mile for their paymasters when that extra mile might get them killed. When we started 
making things go boom in the Pacific Northwest, all of a sudden ZOG had a lot of problems keeping their goons on the job. 
It&apos;s true that the Feds had all this high tech stuff, but it was amazingly easy to beat with very low- tech tactics, once white people 
as a race decided that we were going to fight and we were going to put some guts behind it. The main way that we avoided the 
high-tech crap was to move, move, move and hit, hit, hit! &quot;Hannibal&apos; s first rule of warfare, young Ryan - never fight the enemy 
on ground of his own choosing,&quot; as Tank Thompson told me once. ZOG was not all-powerful and omnipotent, and the Pacific 
Northwest was a very big stretch of territory. The United States government was damned near on its last legs by the time we 
rebelled and they simply didn&apos; t have the manpower, the money, or the technical expertise to be everywhere at once and bring their 
full power to bear. Y ou have to bear in mind also that the bulk of the United States military power in those days had been 
developed with a view towards defeating and occupying Third World nations while the multinational corporations looted their 
natural resources, i.e. the Middle East Fighting an insurgency in the Homeland, pardon the pun, was something they never figured 
into their calculations. There were certain things which, as rough as it got, they never dared to do here in North America, like 
dropping cluster bombs on downtown Seattle. The fact is that the handwriting was on the wall for A merican power as far back as 
Vietnam, when B-52s and napalm and millions of tons of bombs couldn&apos;t defeat a relative handful of little brown men in black 
pajamas, each with an AK-47 and a few magazines and a handful of rice. Just as Israel, with all its made- in- America military 
muscle, never found a way to overcome the Palestinian teenager with the bomb strapped to his body, and America itself never 
found a way to beat the roadside bomb and the guy with the grenade on the back of a motorcycle in downtown Baghdad. The fact 
is that low tech can indeed defeat high tech, if there are some guts behind it. Always with that proviso. The FBI and American 
stooges of various kinds were essentially bullies and cowards, and like all bullies and cowards they folded when someone stood up 
to them. When you have cowards facing men of courage, the brave men will almost always win in the long run no matter how 
many high-tech toys the other side has, because along with physical courage usually comes the other qualities necessary for 
victory. Or as Xenophon put it, the army that is stronger in soul wins. The NVA defeated the United States because we were 
stronger in soul. 

The object of the enemy&apos;s tactics was to somehow prevent us from hitting them, because in the long run they couldn&apos;ttake the 
public embarrassment of being hit. The myth of American invincibility was being shattered. When we killed their people and 
destroyed their property and no one was caught or punished, then they were losing the critical third leg of the revolutionary tripod, 
the credible monopoly of armed force. High tech is only as good as the people behind it, and the people behind it were are a bunch 
of pig- ignorant niggers and Mexicans and feminist bitches who only got where they were by virtue of having tits on them. Y ou 
have to understand that the revolt caught a lot of ZOG almost as much by surprise as it did us. No one ever really believed that us 
white boys in the Northwest would ever find within ourselves the moral courage and find between our legs the necessary meat 
actually to stage any kind of armed revolt against the forces of the Zionist Occupation Government 

The throne of ZOG was a lot shakier than we realized, and bringing it down required a lot less forceful a push than we imagined. 
One of the comments I heard most often from veteran NVA revolutionaries as we sat around the fire at night swapping 
reminiscences was, &quot;Y ou know, we never realized just how easy it would be when the time finally came, how quickly the power 

structure would fall.&quot; 

* * * 

Now, when I say we were a support unit that does not mean that we were totally inactive on our own behalf. We had to operate in 
Lewis County and provide shelter, support, and supplies for several active service units from Tacoma on down to Portland, 

A Distant Thunder 76 



everything from food and clothing to safe refuges, staging areas for operations carried out in the cities, hidden infirmaries and 
medical aid for wounded comrades, intelligence- gathering, money, whatever they needed. That meant that we ourselves had to be 
able to move around the county fairly freely in order to function. The very first thing we had to do was to establish some kind of 
arrangement with the local police to stay out of it They were not trained as soldiers or counter- insurgency commandos, they were 
law enforcement officers who were supposed to deal with criminals, and they had to be made to understand the difference between 
what we were doing and ordinary crime. Also, a good many cops were at least halfway sympathetic to the Party, and so we not 
only had to convince them to mind their own business, but to do so in a way that would not completely anger and alienate them 
and turn them into irreconcilable enemies. &quot;We&apos; re all going to have to live together after the war,&quot; Red Morehouse reminded us. 
&quot;Let&apos; s try to keep the bad blood to a minimum.&quot; That s what I liked about the National Socialists among us: they kept their eyes 
on the ball and were always looking ahead to a victory they knew was inevitable once the white man found his courage again. 
Red and Carter had not been idle during the pre- revolutionary years. They had developed their own sources and they had a list in 
their minds as to all of the local police and sheriff&apos;s deputies and state patrolmen who were non-white, which of the local cops 
were at least somewhat receptive, and which ones were hopelessly Amurrican and not approachable under any circumstances. The 
problem was that the local smokies hadn&apos;t been totally inactive either, and they had a good idea of who most of us were and what 
we looked like. We had to be able to move throughout the county without interference and without them picking up their radios 
and yelling for Federal backup. The state troopers were more of a danger to us than the local forces. By Patrol policy their men 
were from elsewhere than Lewis County and so not locally grounded, they were better trained, the Patrol was more centralized, 
and they were a lot better paid for what they did. A s cops, they weren&apos; t half bad. &quot; D espite what happened at your house to those 
Feds, we need to establish credibility with the local blues,&quot; Red told Carter. &quot;We have to make it clear to them that we consider 
them our racial brothers unless they prove otherwise, but that even if they don&apos;t cooperate with us, they are to give us a wide berth 
and not interfere with our operations. We have to make a few examples, but only those who have actively done harm to our people 
in the past. The cops have to make that connection between hurting us and getting hurt themselves.&quot; 

&quot;Agreed, for the whites. Every black and Mexican cop has to go, to start with,&quot; said Carter. &quot;Not just for racial reasons, either, but 
because their presence has a chilling effect on a lot of the white officers, who will be a hell of a lot more incUned to cut us some 
slack if they don&apos; t face peer pressure in the locker room and if they don&apos; t have potential informers in their own ranks who might 
rat them out to higher ups for political incorrectness.&quot; 

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; agreed Red. &quot;This is now the Northwest American Republic and non-whites are notallowed to carry arms and 
intimidate white people. Hell, they&apos;re not even allowed to be here at all under General Order Number Four. We need to make it 
clear to the white police officers exactly where their loyalties and their personal best interests do not lie.&quot; I overheard Carter and 
Red Morehouse going over the names of potential examples. I have to admit it&apos; s chilling the first time you hear a death list being 
discussed. Not too surprisingly, the list of the most pro- American people in Lewis County happened to be quite heavy with men 
and women who were the most deeply involved with the Christian right and had this bird- brained fundamentalist virus in their 
heads aboutjews being God&apos;s Chosen People. The Wingfields and some of our other comrades were Christian- Christians as 
opposed to J udaeo- Christians, and they always found this one perversion of thought to be particularly offensive. We never lacked 
comrades to deal with Jew- loving preachers. Volunteers whose own Bibles were far more well-thumbed and highlighted than the 
ones the preachers waved around in the pulpit. 

They finally settled on two targets. Robert Blaisdell, chief detective with the Lewis County Sheriff&apos;s Department and head of their 
criminal intelligence and counter- terrorist division, was the guy who kept tabs on all of us evildoers for John Law. Blaisdell was a 
military retiree, originally from Oklahoma I believe, who had married a local girl and gone into police work after he left Fort 
Lewis. He was one of these sickeningly sentimental birdbrains of Mom and God and apple pie who had somehow missed fifty 
years of history, and who still lived an Ozzie Nelson lifestyle in an Ozzie Osboume world. We got to know the type. Mister and 
Mrs. 700 Club. Their houses always had that creepy Pat Boone- ish air about them, as if it were still 1958, or what I guess 1958 
was supposed to look like. Y ou expected Barbie and Ken to appear with a tray of cookies and Hi-C and ask you with lobotomy 
grins if you&apos;d been bom again. (&quot;Bom again, my ass!&quot; snorted Ma Wingfield once. &quot;The real way to astthat question is whether 
you been washed in the Blood or not. That&apos;sone way you can tell a Christian from a Judaeo-Christian!&quot; I loved Ma to death, but I 
always had to resist the temptation to ask her how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. I was afraid she&apos; d tell me.) God 
knows how such people kept it up amidst all the drugs and the buggery and the Spanish and the madness, how they pretended to 
themselves that none of it was happening, but some of them managed it. They seemed caught in a time warp of white bread and 
beehive hairdos and Up With People. Most likely it was because the religious right seemed to have a kind of unofficial 
dispensation from the power stmcture, a grant of immunity from the contamination, because the system found them politically 
useful. Jump for] eeee-zus and praise Israel and you get a pass on nigger junkies beating you to death for the twelve dollars in 
your pocket and Mexicans won&apos; t fuck your blonde daughter, at least in your lifetime. Or maybe I&apos; m just a senile old fool jabbering 
and there wasn&apos; t any reason for it at all except that they were dumb-asses. But damn, some of those Holy J oes made my flesh 
crawl! 

Blaisdell was one these. A buzz-cut, no-necked oaf with a Bible in one hand, a nightstick in the other, and a little Amurrican flag 
lapel pin. He looked forward every day to kilhng a Nat-sy for Christ, becawz the Nat-sies tried to destroy our Bible. J eeee-zus 
loves the little children, red and yellow black and white, they are precious in His sight so knock a Party suspect&apos; s teeth out, hand 
his children over to It Takes A Village, then lie on the witness stand about it all because J eeee-zus is an Amurrican and he 
forgiveth all sins. U-S-A! U-S-A! You get the idea. 

A Distant Thunder 77 



Blaisdell was joined on the spot marked X by another asshole copper from the Dundee PD, a curly-headed blond doofus named 
Des Farrow with that same Jesus- freaky lobotomy smile, whose handsome head was not quite as thick but just as empty as Leon 
Sorels&apos; cranium. Farrow had been Sorels&apos; enthusiastic flunky when he was with the Dundee PD in all the homeless- beating and 
racist- beating. Farrow was so full of brotherly love he was willing to crush kidneys and break bones for it. Whatever the Chamber 
of Commerce commanded, Farrow did. The Amurrican flag on his uniform shoulder was his god. That and his paycheck, of 
course. 

The third example was to be our old buddy Leon Sorels himself, now of the Washington State Patrol. However, it turned out that 
Sorels was very conveniently out of the area at the moment, attending some kind of counter- terrorism conference or some such. 
How ironic. But typical. We hunted Sorels for years, and he always seemed to have some kind of demonic luck looking out for 
him. The devil does indeed take care of his own. For a time. 

Carter Wingfield and Red Morehouse brought a couple of more experienced (by about six weeks) shooters down from the NVA&apos;s 
Seattle Brigade to help them with the wet work, a kid named Cody whom I don&apos; t know what happened to, and an older man who 
called himself Mister Bill and who was the Republic&apos; s first ambassador to Canada twenty-odd years later when Ottawa finally 
acknowledged the Republic&apos; s existence. In December of that year the four men went out every night and hunted down black and 
brown blue boys. They ambushed one Mexican cop in Centralia with over fifty bullets in his car, killed one black sheriff&apos;s deputy 
on a remote back road near Mossy Rock, and toasted another black nice and crispy in Chehalis when they tossed a Molotov 
cocktail into his squad car with him in it. There were about two dozen more no n- white police on the list all around the county, but 
it wasn&apos;t necessary to track them down. By Christmas every black, brown, oryellow police officer in Lewis County had resigned 
and left the area. They very quickly understood the message as some of their white colleagues never did, and they saw what was 
coming far more clearly than some of their white colleagues ever did. No one had to teach them to think racially. They did it 
naturally. Sometimes being primitive is an advantage. 

In Christmas week the two guys from Seattle had to go back for some heavy scuffling you can read about in the history books if 
you&apos; re interested, and I got to fill in on the two white cops we had selected to convey our firm but polite message to local law 
enforcement to mind their own damned business where the NVA was concerned. Before we went out. Carter took me aside. 
&quot; Shane, I swear before G od this is the last time I&apos; 11 ask you about this, but can you handle what you&apos; 11 have to do? W e just want 
you to drive, but you&apos; re going to have to keep your head and you&apos; re going to be part of a murder, the murder of a police officer. 
ZOG won&apos;t look kindly on that, whatever your role.&quot; 

&quot;ZOG doesn&apos; t look kindly on me already. After that beating I took from Sorels I&apos; 11 pull the trigger on his stinky ass myself, or any 
other cop,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Y ou may have to if Red and I flub it,&quot; said Carter. &quot;Make no mistake, Shane, we can&apos;t miss. These bad boys have got to go 
down, because if we flub it then we&apos; 11 have all of the aggravation with none of the rep. We want to scare these mothers shitless to 
the point where they back off, not just piss them off. When you go after a tiger, even a senile tiger, you have to kill it, not just 
wound it&quot; 

We waited until dark and then we rolled. I drove a nice roomy Lincoln Continental town car that Rooney and China, of all people, 
had boosted the day before. They had hot-wired it and disabled the teletracker with the global positioning indicator like old hands. 
Carter and the girls had then re- sprayed the Lincoln and fixed it up with bogus license plates. I was a bit pissed off because the 
girls had gotten a little taste of active service before me. Carter gave me a Brazilian- made Taurus .357 Magnum while he sat 
behind me packing the same Tek-9 I&apos;d been issued for my little stint of guard duty on 10/22, only he&apos;d screwed on the ten- inch 
barrel this time. Red was in the passenger seat beside me with a pump shotgun between his knees. 

Chief Detective Blaisdell was simple. It was all over almost before I realized what was happening. He lived on a quiet back street 
in one of the more upscale Chehalis neighborhoods and was taking no precautions at all. Even after the attacks directed against his 
fellow officers of the Hispanic and Affikin-Amurkin persuasion, I guess it simply never occurred to him that anyone would dare to 
come after an all- Amurrican copozoid in his own home. Otherwise don&apos;t ask me what the hell the idiot was doing standing full 
framed in a lighted window. Blaisdell&apos; s house stood on a comer. I hung a left in the cold winter blackness, intending to do a circle 
around the block so the other two could check out the lay of the land, but it wasn&apos;t necessary. We were presented right away with 
a perfect target. There in a side window of what was evidently his kitchen I saw a large gray-haired man in his fifties, in a short- 
sleeved pastel shirt with no tie, big weight-lifting muscles like all the cops in those days had to intimidate normal people, although 
to be fair I think all Blaisdell&apos; s were proper home grown and not steroid. He had too much hair left for it to be steroids. He was 
standing over the sink doing something. &quot;That works,&quot; said Carter, rolling down his power window. &quot;Nice slow stop, Shane.&quot; I 
stopped the Lincoln easy and smooth. If he heard us pull up outside, Blaisdell didn&apos;t even look up. I guess after 10/22 cops in the 
Northwest took some time to realize it was a whole new ball game and pick up survival skills, just like us. It was a narrow side 
yard and he was standing in the lighted window maybe forty feet from us. Carter braced the Tek-9 on the window sill with both 
hands; with the window down I could see his breath frosting in the air in my rear view mirror. He cut loose with two short bursts 
on full auto. The rattle of the machine pistol shattered the quiet of the night. I know that&apos; s a cliche, but that&apos; s the best way I can 
describe it Carter&apos; s shots were neatly placed with a good tight pattern. I only saw one round hit the window sill and a couple more 
strike the back of the kitchen wall in the light; all the others went into the target I saw Blaisdell twirl, a red spray of blood from 
his mangled torso twisting into the air like a corkscrew, and then he disappeared out of sight as he dropped to the floor. 
Somewhere in the house a woman screamed in horror. Without being told I accelerated slowly and cruised on out of the 
neighborhood, sticking to the speed limit as cool and leisurely as could be. I understood from the woman&apos; s screams exactly what 

A Distant Thunder 78 



we had just done and I didn&apos;t give a flying fuck, because I still felt Sorels&apos; nightstick on my side and I knew that man would have 
hurt Rooney and China if we&apos; d let him. Blaisdell made his choice and drew his paycheck, and now the bill had come due, so to 
hell with him. Two minutes later I was heading towards the 1-5. &quot;Which way?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;North,&quot; said Carter &quot;Head for Dundee. Farrow is on patrol tonight. Let&apos;stry for a double header&quot; About twenty minutes later we 
cruised into Dundee on Harrison Avenue and right by the Burger Doodle where I&apos; d worked in high school. We saw a police car in 
the parking lot. &quot;Number 491. That&apos;s Farrow&apos;s unit.&quot; 

&quot;That&apos;s him standing in line for his grease and cholesterol,&quot; said Red as we cruised through the lot I saw a tall blond figure in a 
blue uniform. Even through the foggy windows of the restaurant I could see the big 9- millimeter Clock in its black leather holster 
on the thick utility belt, the canister of mace and the handcuffs in their case, the shiny black patent leather shoes. I think I could 
even see the creases in his trousers, although maybe that was just from growing up in Dundee and seeing those swaggering apes 
before. 

&quot;Do we park and go in after him?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;No, too many white people in there,&quot; said Carter &quot;I don&apos;t want to start our campaign in Lewis County with innocent bystanders 
maybe getting shot. Shane, cut your lights. Now very carefully, back into that space two cars down from the patrol car. Keep the 
engine running. Let&apos; s hope he&apos; s getting takeout grease for supper and he doesn&apos; t decide to sit down and enjoy the formica 
ambience. The shorter time we&apos; re here, the less chance of somebody remembering the car or our faces.&quot; A few minutes later 
Farrow came strolling out of the Burger Doodle, carrying a bag of food. We could smell the fries from where we were. &quot;Pull out 
and cruise past him, slow. I&apos;m going to have to go for a head shot, since he&apos; s probably wearing his vest&quot; I did as he told me, and 
when we were level with the cop I slowed to a stop without being told. Farrow had his hand on the door of the squad car to open it 
and when he looked up he had just time enough to see the barrel of the Tek- 9 and scream like a woman, throwing his hand up with 
the burger bag in an effort to protect his face. Carter fired on semi- auto this time, carefully aimed marksman&apos; s shots. The first shot 
blew the bag wide open and scattered hot coffee, fries, and a Super Burger in fragments. The second bullet went into Officer 
Farrow&apos; s mouth and he spewed blood and teeth, gurgling and clawing at the roof of the squad car. We saw the third shot pop brain 
and bone into the air in a fine spray. I pulled back onto Harrison Avenue and eased our bods back out onto the interstate, 
effortlessly blending with traffic, and headed back to our latest holeup in a house just outside Napavine. I leaned back and said to 
Carter, &quot;Hey, before you shot that bastard you should have yelled for him to say hello to his butt buddy Sorels. Or at least hasta la 
vista, baby.&quot; 

&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; asked Carter &quot;I didn&apos;t come here for conversation. I came here to kill the man and leave. That&apos;s all. If I&apos;d 
stopped to chat that might have given him just the necessary moment to react to jerk the squad car door open and cover down 
behind it to get his gun out It might have turned into a fair fight and a fair fight is what we can&apos; t afford to have.&quot; 
Red Morehouse spoke up. &quot;I agree, absolutely. Shane, in the context of what we&apos; re doing, fair means slanted in favor of ZOG . 
They hold all the cards and we can&apos;t afford to give them a single inch or a single second we don&apos;t have to. We are not knights in 
shining armor on a quest seeking the Holy Grail. We are freedom fighters trying to secure the existence of our people and a future 
forwhite children. That means we are attempting to achieve avery specific political objective, not personal glory. We are not out 
to engage in single combat with the enemy and prove what a man we are by defeating him in some Viking epic. This isn&apos;t about 
you or me or Carter or Farrow or Sorels, it s about the Republic. When the media call us cowards, as they no doubt will be doing 
tomorrow, to hell with &apos; em. C owards don&apos; t rebel in arms against the most unspeakable tyranny in human history. Remember the 
rule of one of our greatest racial heroes. General Francis Marion of South Carolina, the Swamp Fox. He who fights and runs away, 
lives to fight another day.&quot; 

&quot;And no conversation,&quot; Carter reminded me. &quot;Two in the head, make sure they&apos;re dead. Badda bing, badda boom, as the hoods on 
TV say. By the way, son, you did damned good tonight&quot; That night was in fact the foundation of my reputation as an NVA 
wheelman with a steady hand and a cool nerve, and eventually E Company started getting requests from crews all up and down 
the 1-5 corridor for my chauffering services. 

Red was right about the media screaming and hollering to the high heavens after we whacked those two blues. On top of the 
Mexican and the two niggers, that was five dead coppers, and they went ballistic, like they&apos; d just noticed that Lewis County law 
enforcement officers were dropping dead with lead poisoning. When we were still on the road Carter took out a prepaid, 
untraceable cell phone and called one of the TV stations in Olympia. He gave them a code word that he had somehow arranged 
with them beforehand. I think it was the old I.R.A . wheeze of calling himself Captain 0&apos; Neill. Anyway, Carter gave the code 
word and a quick little speech about the forces of the Northwest Republic striking down the minions of ZOG tyranny, the spirit of 
Coeur d&apos; Alene lived on, so forth and so on. This was right after they had spent the past week crowing and cackling in triumph 
about how that unpleasantness in Coeur d&apos; Alene was pretty much all mopped up now, the wicked Old Man was in prison where he 
belonged and the wicked forces of racist fascist domestic terrorism had been smote hip and thigh and the NVA were on the run. 
Hell, if you listened to the Centcom press releases, they had us on the run for all five years right up until they surrendered. The 
powers that be were embarrassed by little escapades like what we&apos; d just done, and they freaked. We always had a knack for 
embarrassing ZOG like that 

The next day the newspapers and the TV news were full of our previous evening&apos;s dashing derring-do. Various top coppers 
appeared as talking heads on TV, practically stuttering and gibbering as they vowed swift and bloody vengeance against us 
evildoers. I swear I saw one of them sweating from his quivering jowls in December &quot;Bluff. He&apos;s scared,&quot; said Rooney with a 
satisfied smile, standing with her arms crossed as we watched him on the six o&apos; clock news. Damn, she was fine... I wish you could 

A Distant Thunder 79 



have seen her standing proud and tall like that. Warrior women don&apos;t wear armored bikinis. They wear jeans and pullover 
sweaters and Reebok runners. 

&quot;Good/&apos; I said. &quot;It&apos;s about time they were scared. They been dishing it out for a mighty longtime. Now let&apos; s see if they can take 
it.&quot; Sorels&apos; nightstick in my kidneys had left an impression beyond the physical, and I was not at all inclined towards the milk of 
human kindness where cops were concerned. I&apos; m not kidding, though, those media reptiles laid it on thick. The two slain officers 
were both living saints, of course. The beatings, the perjury on the stand, the corruption and the arrogant bullying by a couple of 
badge- toting assholes with nothing but pork fat between their ears were air- brushed out of the picture. Of larger political or racial 
context there was not a hint. We were just evildoers who had popped up from nowhere and done bad acts for no reason other than 
the devil made us do it. Oh, yeah, the NVA were just the most horrible two-legged critters in the world. To hear the pundits tell it, 
we were the very embodiment of that Satanic force of evil white male racism and no n- diversity, come to bright and pristine Lewis 
County, Washington at the behest of that evil Old Man to commit horrible acts of domestic terrorism and general political 
incorrectness against the loyal and patriotic African- Americans, Hispano- Americans, Native Americans, gyno- Americans and 
bugger- Americans who resided therein. But never fear! The gallant and strong-jawed forces of the red, white and blue would 
smash the evil fascist insect beneath the talons of the mighty Amurrican eagle, and life would soon be worth living again! It is 
always darkest before the dawn! There&apos;s got to be a morning after! Onward and upward! beautiful for spacious skies... blah blah 
blah, ishkabibble. 

That kind of moo was to be their standard propaganda line for the next five years. It was utterly ridiculous, a revolting and stupid 
display of sentimentality over two men whose deaths, I grant you, were pretty brutal, but who didn&apos; t deserve jack shit by way of 
sympathy. Those guys chose to be soldiers for a tyrant and take the tyrant&apos; s shilling, they chose to beat and persecute their 
neighbors for money or because they just plain liked it, and they paid the price. 

The most revolting thing the media did during that particular little circus was that some liberal principal at a Chehalis elementary 
school led his little kiddies from the second grade out to Blaisdell&apos; s house. There they stood in front of the crime scene tape, with 
the television cameras rolling on a nationwide live feed, where they all held little Stars and Stripes and sang &quot;America the 
Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot; There was hardly a dry eye as all of Amurrica went aaawwwww! Carter watched in 
silence and made a note of the fool&apos; s name. The media folded up their klieg lights and their cameras and went away. The 
Northwest V olunteer A rmy didn&apos; t A few weeks later the principal got a blanket party in the parking lot of his school as he left for 
the day. We threw a blanket over his head and thumped him gentle and artistic with bats and iron pipes, until the blanket was 
bloody and he stopped screaming and begging us for mercy like the yellow piece of shit coward he was. Like all of them were, 
deep down. I don&apos; t think I ever met one of those red, white, and blue Rambo J ohn W ay ne wannabe creeps during the entire war 
who had as much courage in his whole body as one NVA Volunteer had in his or her littie finger. I guess you might say that&apos; s one 
big reason why we won. When push came to shove, we were wilhng to die for our cause. They weren&apos;t. When the principal got 
out of the hospital he found himself unable to resist the lure of 1-5 South and sunny Califom-i-yay. Five years later those same 
children were in middle school, only now their school chorus was singing Homeland and A Mighty Fortress Is Our God. Music to 
our ears indeed. 

On Christmas Eve we went out a- hunting with two precious gifts from the Army Council, captured RPGs from Iraq. We went into 
Centralia, down on Pearl Street, and fired them into the windows of the police station. They were about forty years old, Soviet 
manufacture, but they still worked and the bangs were most satisfactory. Carter figured I was up to trigger- pulling capability now 
and so I was one of the gunners, after he carefully showed me how to use the sight and switch even though it was all in Arabic. I 
violated Carter&apos; s precepts against conversation and yelled &quot;Bah, humbug!&quot; as I cut loose with the rocket- propelled grenade. To 
top off that merriest of Christmases, when we got back to holeup number four since 10/22, a trailer out in Bucoda, Ma Wingfield 
and the girls had a tree set up and somebody had hung a sprig of mistietoe, and I got a very demonstrative kiss number four from 
Rooney to general cheers and commentary. I might have gotten more that night, but it was only a singlewide trailer and there were 
nine of us bunking therein, plus regular wakeups for sentry duty. Everybody politely ignored it when Rooney and I slept together 
snuggled on the main faux leather sofa. In our clothes and with our guns in our belts, but we did sleep together. By then it was 
pretty much understood Rooney and I were an item. 

The next morning in the pre- dawn hours a team of us consisting of myself. Carter, Rooney, Mack the Knife, and Brett Sills crept 
out of the trailer early. We drove through the mist in one car and one pickup truck along quiet and deserted back highways up to 
Olympia, and in the glorious light of rising dawn on the birth date of Christ, we kicked in the doors of the synagogue onjefferson 
Street, poured gasoline on the floor and fixtures, and torched the building. Some bearded hebe from nearby came running in 
screaming, and somebody shot him. Wasn&apos;t me; I just looked up when I heard the shot and saw the kike flip- flopping in his blood 
on the floor before he croaked. Brett took his yarmulke for a souvenir. Noel, Noel! Ma wouldn&apos;t let China come with us to bum 
the synagogue because she needed help with the full Christmas dinner she welcomed us back with, replete with turkey and ham 
and sweet potatoes and stuffing and cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. 

The night after Christmas Carter beckoned me to the door. &quot;Tonight we go out for conversation,&quot; he said. The necessary 
conversation was to take place in Chehalis, with a Lewis County sheriff s deputy I had never seen before and whose name was 
completely unfamiliar to me. He lived in an apartment building up along the hill above Main Street. Carter had procured a key 
from somewhere and let us into a side door, and we waited silently just outside Apartment #103 until the deputy left at ten o&apos; clock 
in full uniform to go on shift. Carter grabbed him from behind and I belted him in the belly— fortunately he hadn&apos;t gotten to the 
station and put on his vest yet— and before he knew it I had his gun out of the holster. Carter slammed him against the wall, his 

A Distant Thunder 80 



arm twisted behind his back, and stuck the barrel of a .357 under his ear. &quot;Hey, Greg,&quot; he said. &quot;Y ou and me need to have a 

word.&quot; 

&quot;What the fuck are you doing. Carter?&quot; snarled the deputy bitterly. He was scared but he was angry as well &quot;And why the hell are 

you doing it to me? I always liked you! I never did anything to you or your people!&quot; 

&quot;Y eah, I know,&quot; said Carter. &quot;That&apos; s why you&apos; re not lying dead on the carpet right now. Be quiet and hsten. Y ou saw what went 

down in Coeur d&apos; Alene on October 22&quot;^&apos;? On TV?&quot; 

&quot;Of course I did,&quot; said the deputy. 

&quot;The grand and glorious President of the United States says the Party is beaten.&quot; He gently pressed the gun barrel. &quot;Does this feel 

like we&apos;re beaten, Greg? Does it?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; said the cop. 

&quot;Y ou saw our Christmas present to the blue boys in Centralia Did that come from anybody who was defeated? Y ou figure Bob 

Blaisdell thinks we&apos;re beaten? You think Des Farrow considers us beaten? Does he?&quot; 

&quot;You yellow Nazi cop-killing bastard!&quot; hissed Greg. 

&quot;Let us define our terms, my brother in Christ,&quot; said Carter gently. &quot;I am not a National Socialist, although as it happens my 

young associate here is. I am a believer in what used to be called muscular Christianity. I am also a lean, mean, redneck 

motherfucker Bastard yes, yellow is a matter of opinion, cop- killing for sure. Are we clear on all these distinctions? Now, there is 

one more distinction which it is importantyou recognize. I kill bad cops, Greg. Cops who beat our people in their cells. Cops who 

plant evidence and frame our people. Cops who lie on witness stands. Cops who lie to grand juries. Cops who cooperate with the 

FBI to commit crimes and violate the rights of white people. Cops who take money from certain local businessmen to sweep the 

streets clean of us white trash and keep all pleasant for the Mexicans who are taking the bread out of the mouths and the shoes off 

the feet of white children. Don&apos;t piss me off by pretending you don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about.&quot; 

&quot;Y ou mean Blaisdell and Farrow were dirty?&quot; said the deputy with a sneer &quot;So what the hell else is new? Y eah, sure, everybody 

in Lewis County knew that Them and umpteen others. But dammit. Carter, they were cops! Y ou don&apos;t kill cops! Y ou done time, 

you ought to know the rules! What the hell were you thinking?&quot; 

&quot;Criminals don&apos;t kill cops, true,&quot; said Carter &quot;But I&apos;m no longer a criminal. I&apos;m a patriot.&quot; 

&quot;Y ou mean you&apos;ve found a fucking flag to wave,&quot; said Greg the deputy contemptuously. &quot;That blue, white and green thing you 

people flash around.&quot; 

&quot;As you say. It is a good flag and a righteous one, but the rules have still changed. Police officers are now no longer obstacles to 

be avoided. Criminals evade cops. Patriots don&apos;t. They are soldiers of the establishment, military targets to be destroyed. Y ou 

signed on to be a policeman, Greg, not a soldier. No one ever mentioned anything about a war when you decided to go for a 

pension. Now you listen to me and you take this to the sheriff and whoever else it needs to be taken to. Y ou are hereby served 

notice that from this point on, units of the Northwest V olunteer A rmy will be operating— let me repeat that— we will be operating 

in Lewis County. We are the law now. The United States is not. Y ou will not, let me repeat that, you will not in any way interfere 

with the operations or movements or other activities of the Northwest Volunteer Army. Y ou will not, let me repeat that, you will 

not co-operate with the Federal forces in any way, shape or form. Anyone who does will get exactly what Blaisdell and Farrow 

got. And if you should succeed in taking out me and my family and anyone else, then others will come from elsewhere and take 

over where we left off, and they will not regard you with a kindly gleam in their eye. The revolution is forever Is this quite 

clear?&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;ll pass it on, but you don&apos;t seriously expect... &quot; 

&quot;I expect nothing,&quot; Carter told him grimly. &quot;Expectation don&apos;t come into it. I am simply telling you what is going to happen if 

your superiors don&apos;t wake up and smell the coffee. No law enforcement officer in Lewis County will be safe, on duty or off duty. 

Unless you agree to a live and let live arrangement with the Northwest V olunteer A rmy, then every time you step outside your 

house to do your shift, there is a very good chance you won&apos;t be coming home. If you make us your enemies, then we will treat 

you as enemies. This goes beyond any question of who&apos; s breaking whose laws, Greg. This is a war. Can&apos; t you understand that? I 

repeat, you guys aren&apos;t soldiers, you&apos; re cops. Y ou&apos; re supposed to fight crime, not serve as cannon fodder&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;ve been cannon fodder before in Iraq, thank you,&quot; sighed Greg. 

&quot;Then why would you want to go for more of the same right here on your own doorstep?&quot; asked Carter 

&quot;What, exactly, do you want?&quot; asked Greg. I knew then we&apos;d won. 

&quot;Live and let live. Y ou see us on the street, you look the other way, you don&apos;t pick up your radios, and you don&apos;t shoot at us. We 

see you on the street, we don&apos;t shoot at you. We simply become invisible to you. Above all, Greg, no cooperation with the Feds! 

As far as you are concerned, you are what you always were, police officers concerned with suppressing crime in the community. 

This is henceforth a private war and it doesn&apos; t concern you.&quot; 

&quot;You know that is ridiculous and impossible!&quot; said Greg in exasperation. 

&quot;Maybe. I don&apos;t suggest you try to sell it to the Feds. No need to mention anything to them at all, in fact.&quot; Carter told him. &quot;Just 

yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir, but when it comes to actually doing anything to assist them in the battle against evil domestic 

terrorism, all of a sudden you&apos; re deaf, dumb, and blind. Y ou kick us with the side of the shoe and not the toe. We will do unto you 

as you do unto us.&quot; 

&quot; It&apos; s impossible! &quot; wailed G reg again. &quot; Y ou know we&apos; re going to have to show some kind of effort to put you guys away or the 

Fed bastards will figure it out and they&apos;ll come down on us!&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 81 



&quot;Just kick us with the side of the shoe, notthe toe, Greg/&apos; Carter repeated. &quot;That&apos;s all I ask. Look, we&apos;re reahstic. We know full 
well this is going to be a hard kind of agreement to fulfill on both sides, and there will be rough spots. But nobody wants trouble 
between two groups of white men who are going to have to live together after all this is over. I don&apos; t want to hurt you, G reg. . . &quot; 
&quot;I want to hurt you, Greg,&quot; I suddenly spoke up, sticking his own police special 9- mil in his face and cocking back the hammer. 
&quot; Y our friend Sorels hurt me, and now I want to hurt you. A nd all your little cop friends. D o we understand each other?&quot; I have no 
idea why I said what I said then and messed with Carter&apos;s play. I just always had this instinct for making the right moves where 
the Wingfields were concerned. Apparently I can come on real psycho, or at least I could back then. Well, I was kind of psycho 
back then. Nowadays I&apos;m just a senile old crank. Carter told me afterwards my timing was perfect. 

&quot;Jesus, do you see what I have to deal with?&quot; hissed Carter to the deputy. &quot;You think I&apos;m a bad guy, Greg? Some of these young 
kids the Party has coming up scare me silly! Do you want a dozen of these on your streets looking to get you off somewhere 
secluded and put a few slugs in you every time you go on shift? Or coming to visit you in the middle of the night? Or attaching 
new accessories to your car while you&apos; re asleep? Y ou don&apos; t want what we can dish out, G reg, and we don&apos; t want to dish it out 
because we have more important work to do and it doesn&apos;t include screwing around with you local yokels! We have better things 
to do than waste our time wasting you guys. ZOG doesn&apos;t care about you. To the FBI and those suits in Washington you&apos; re as 
expendable as paper clips! Talk to the sheriff, Greg. Simple agreement, live and let live. We stay out of one another&apos; sway and we 
each pretend the other doesn&apos;t exist, and whenever one hand can wash the other, we wash. No political bullshit, no alliances or 
formalities, just every cop and every Northwest Volunteer in Lewis County agrees that from this point on we just don&apos;t fuck with 
each other. That&apos;s all Otherwise from now on you all keep your shades drawn and you stay out of Burger Doodles. And by the 
way, in case you&apos; re in any doubt, we&apos; re going to win.&quot; 

&quot;And on the wild chance that the sheriff and the dozen or so municipal chiefs of police in this county agree... ?&quot; asked Greg. 
&quot;A personal ad in the Dundee Advertiser saying &apos;Thanks for a great time, lawnmower girl&apos; &quot; Carter told him. Then we handcuffed 
the deputy to a radiator with his own cuffs and left. 

A few years ago I went into the Party history museum in Olympia out of curiosity to see what past bullshit they were digging up 
now. They had a big display case with a blown- up reproduction of the historic lawnmower girl personals ad that appeared in the 
Advertiser a week later, and when you pushed the button a voice narrator described that first live and let live arrangement between 
the NVA and local law enforcement in Washington&apos;s Rebel County. Carter&apos;s name was mentioned and mine wasn&apos;t, and that&apos;s as 
it should be. It was historic because it was the first time that the Party&apos; s power to deal life and death was formally recognized by a 
Zionist authority and aceded to. What the Old Man referred to as the United States government&apos; s loss of the credible monopoly of 
armed force began on the day that ad appeared. Carter&apos; s little impromptu agreement became more or less the model for the Party&apos; s 
pragmatic arrangements with hundreds of local police departments across tiie Northwest, because police were not soldiers, our 
own battle was not with the police, and neither side wanted what the other could dish out. I didn&apos;t know it until after the war, but 
in the third year of the revolt Greg joined the NVA and he won an Iron Cross when he single-handedly cleaned a nest of Feds out 
of the Queen Anne post office in Seattle. I met him once at an Old NVA Reunion, bought him a beer, and since I was feeling 
particularly perverse that night, I didn&apos;t remind him where we&apos;d once met before. I chuckled about it all the way home. 
That&apos; s when it first dawned on us how easy this might turn out to be. This wasn&apos; t a TV show where the big blue shield always 
triumphs over us evildoers in swaggering cop- vengeance just before the cut to the last commercial. The cops on those TV shows 
who talked so big and bad about defending A murrica and triumphing over evil racism and did in the big bad Nazis with kung fu 
weren&apos; t cops, they were actors. This was the real world. These were real cops in a part of the country that the government 
considered to be a small rural backwater, even more underpaid and overworked than usual. We shot them and they bled just like 
anybody else. W e faced them down and they ra n . W e hurt them and they ra n . M ost of them weren&apos; t exactly the sharpest knives in 
the drawer to begin with, a lot of them had gone into the police right out of the military because it was the only job they could get, 
and they weren&apos;t completely blind to the injustice white people suffered under the laws they enforced. In fact, depending on what 
kind of affirmative action program their department had and where they served, a lot of them knew that injustice at first hand a lot 
better than most. They weren&apos;t all Sorels&apos; warped type, and a good many cops were capable of living in the real world even if they 
didn&apos;t hke it. Don&apos;t get me wrong, NVA-local police relations were always tricky at best, and when they were more or less herded 
against us at gunpoint by the Feds a lot of them made a fight of it, hurt our people, and we had to hurt back. But in Lewis County, 
we soon found that we were usually able at least to go to the grocery store in safety. 

Usually. 

* * * 

A few weeks later in mid-January, our team was back in Dundee, squatting in what used to be the old overnight crews&apos; quarters at 
the railway yard. I was sent out on a grocery run with John Pilafski and two of our people who were down from Seattle after a bit 
of night- riding, and who needed to cool off a bit, but who wanted to stretch their legs. They were a guy named Sully and his 
girlfriend, a short but voluptuous lass with black hair and lovely green eyes named Jonesy. I presumed from these nicks that their 
actual names were Sullivan and Jones, although as always one didn&apos;t ask. 

Grocery runs were fairly frequent affairs, because at any given time we were feeding at least two dozen people and sometimes 
more, in five or six multiple locations or more, since we tried to avoid congregating in one base camp. It wasn&apos; t a good idea for 
any of us to walk into a store alone, buy up five shopping carts full of food and pay cash. That was the kind of thing sharp-eyed 
clerks with itchy telephone fingers noticed. Despite the great Dundee pizza hijack of 10/22, neither were we in a Woody Allen 
movie where we could go to a fast food restaurant and march away with wheelbarrows full of burgers and onion rings being 

A Distant Thunder 82 



pushed by waiters at gunpoint The practical result was that any time we were out and about, doing anything that didn&apos; t involve 
general mayhem, we had all kinds of routine maintenance errands we had to do, prominent among them buying groceries. We 
were given cash by Ma or Red Morehouse and we stopped all along the way at multiple markets, buying a bagful of canned goods 
here, non-perishable cereal like oatmeal there, the staples like coffee and tea and rice, vitamins, cigarettes by the carbon for those 
who smoked— only one carton at a time as large tobacco purchases of multiple brands would also have caused comment— so forth 
and so on. But sometimes the cupboard still went bare and we had to make special runs. 

Supply runs followed the same rules as all tickles. Two vehicles, four people. Two went into the market with a list, got what was 
needed and got out. One vehicle parked in the lot with the driver as a lookout and another cruised a wider area, both on guard 
against any potential problems, cell phones open. In the event of problems the two on foot were try to get to the nearer vehicle 
first, but if that wasn&apos; t possible there was a designated pickup point if anyone had to make a fast break on foot, which in our case 
on that fateful day we went shopping at Fulton&apos; s Market we decided would be the comer of Second and Magnolia, a block down. 
We had developed a lot of these techniques in the pre- revolutionary years doing illegal leaflet distributions, sticker raids, flag 
actions, and other things that should have come under the old First A mendment if Z G had allowed free speech to remain in 
force; another price they paid for introducing the concept of hatecrime for white people who criticized multiculturalism. If we&apos; d 
just been allowed to stand up in public and say what was on our minds without retaliation in the generation before the war, who 
knows how things would have turned out? But Red was right. Eventually the Jews always overdo it. 

In the past couple of months we&apos;d already had a couple of close calls, and so we followed the drill when we pulled into the lot at 
Fulton&apos; s Market on Second Street about two in the afternoon on a clear and sunny day, although it was quite cold. Sullivan and 
Jones went into the store, I back- in parked at the far end of the lot with the engine turned off (an alert cop always knows to take a 
second look at anyone sitting in a car with the engine running) and I put my baseball cap on backwards while I held a computer 
game conspicuously in my hand, which I pretended to be playing while I scanned the lot. Johnny circled the area in a wide, 
leisurely patrol pattern about six blocks around. Maybe five minutes had gone by since the two Volunteers went into the store, I 
figured they&apos;d be in the checkout line by now, and I was watching the doors for them to emerge when I saw the Washington State 
Patrol cruiser slide into the lot. Then another. Then a third unit rolled in at the far entrance to the lot down on my right. No blue 
lights, no sirens. This looked bad. We were well inside the city hmits, it was DPD jurisdiction and the state troopers shouldn&apos;t 
even be here. I dropped down below the wheel of my own Taurus as one of the squad cars went by, and after a few seconds I 
peeped over the dashboard. They were moving into place to block both entrances and exits near the frontage of the supermarket, 
and I saw a huge figure get out of one of the patrol cars wearing a Smokey the Bear hat. Even at a distance I could tell it was my 
old buddy Sergeant Leon Sorels. Journeys end in lovers meeting, I thought madly to myself, knowing that I was within seconds of 
watching two of my comrades die. 

Now it was my time. The moment when I would decide what kind of man I was and what kind of man I would be. I understood 
this, and at the same time I was damned near crapping in my pants, I thanked God for giving me the awareness of that moment, 
for it is granted to few human beings to know when it happens. Usually we don&apos; t recognize our defining moment until it&apos; s long 
past, no matter how we handle it. But I&apos;d been thinking about it a lot over the past few months, and I knew. W e had all been 
briefed on General Order Number Eight, the &quot;feets don&apos;t fail me now&quot; order which stated that whenever we were confronted with 
overwhelming force we were to un-ass the area pronto and live to fight another day. By now I counted four patrol cars in the lot, 
two troopers per car opening their doors and stepping out, some with riot helmets and shotguns and flak jackets, and I had to 
assume that more were coming, which I am sure fit anyone&apos; s reasonable definition of overwhelming force. I had a good rep with 
the crew as a cool and steady hand, I had General Order Number Eight to cover my ass, and while Sully and Jonesy were 
comrades they were not from our particular unit, strangers in a sense, barely on speaking terms. I recalled Red&apos; s little pep talk the 
night we whacked Officer Des Farrow about how my purpose was not to be a hero engaging in private duels with the enemy, I 
was a political soldier trying to achieve a political objective, the mission came first, and the media&apos;s schoolyard taunts of 
cowardice were neither here nor there. 

There was just one problem with that. Running away and leaving your comrades alone and on foot to face down an enemy ambush 
on their own happens really to be cowardice. 

I was sure the Wingfields would be so glad to get me back in one piece that no one would judge me if I yelled a number eight into 
the cell phone, abandoned the Taurus and had Johnny pick me up a few blocks away. But how would I myself judge the face I saw 
in the mirror every day? I had already decided in my own mind that my brave talk at Chowder Society meetings and under the 
trees behind the Wingfield house with Rooney about being willing to give up my own life for my new country wasn&apos;t going to be 
just talk to impress her. I meant it in my heart I was sure I meant it when I said it, anyway, and I knew I&apos; d damned well better 
prove to Rooney that I meant it Well, now my bluff was being called, and I had about five more seconds to do something that 
would give that boy and girl in the store some kind of fighting chance, and which would inevitably turn the attention of eight well 
trained and heavily armed mercenaries right on me. No cover of night no catching them off guard, just me and them with our 
respective weapons in our hands. Oh, crap. 

Before I could even make a conscious decision, I was just doing it I picked up the cell phone and spoke, &quot;Hey, Albert. I got three 
orders coming up off the grill and I&apos; 11 pull them if I can, but I may need you to pull three.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, Carl,&quot; replied Pilafski. John later told me my voice was calm. I must be a calm hysteric, then, because I was half out of my 
mind with fear and pumping adrenalin. I felt down into a gym bag on the seat beside me, beneath the sweaty shorts and socks and 
towels my hand came on the cold metal of my gun for the day. I pulled out a stainless steel .357 Magnum revolver with a six inch 

A Distant Thunder 83 



barrel and a plastic black Pachmayr grip that through some pen^erse destiny fit nice and solidly into my small palm. It was John 
Hunt&apos;s old Colt thank God, not that chintzy Brazilian Taurus, and I knew it was loaded with some of Carter&apos;s hand- made 
devastator rounds with a cap in the tip of each slug, so there was a chance I could pierce the state troopers&apos; Kevlar. The gun was 
heavy and yet it hefted well. I had one cylindrical speedloader with another six cartridges and some loose rounds in my shirt 
pocket; I could see one of the troopers leaning over the roof of his squad car with a 40- mm grenade launcher ready to fire tear gas 
or even a shot round, and another had an M-16 out. This ambush looked a bit impromptu. Probably somebody in the store had 
gotten suspicious and called 911 and the state police responded, since I&apos;m sure word had already gotten around that the Dundee 
cops had been compromised by me and Carter&apos;s little heart-to-heart talk with Greg on New Year&apos;s Eve. 
I was about to dial Sully&apos; s cell number to warn them when I saw the two of them pass in front of the window of the market, their 
arms full of brown paper bags of groceries. Ma always asked us to bring her the paper bags instead of the plastic ones because 
they made good garbage bags. There was no more time. The two Volunteers would be walking through the door in about three 
seconds. There was only one thing for me to do. Through some miracle the cops didn&apos;t know that Shane Ryan was around, but it 
was time for me to introduce &apos;em to the boy. I slid out of the car, snuck around to the right passenger side of the Taurus where I&apos; d 
have a little bit more metal and upholstery between myself and incoming bullets, and then I crouched down and leveled a two- 
handed firing stance on the hood, keeping as low a profile as I could, and I aimed the .357 right at Leon Sorels&apos; broad back about 
thirty yards away where he stood in a similar position with his own weapon pointed at the automatic door of the supermarket The 
doors opened and Comrade Sullivan and Comrade Jones stepped out and froze when they saw the reception committee. On this 
occasion at least, possibly because there were potential witnesses around. Sergeant Sorels went through the procedural motions by 
bellowing &quot;Police! Drop your..!&quot; at which point I shot him in the back, as unchivalrously as Red Morehouse could have wished. 
And missed. 

Okay, so I was scared pea green and I wasn&apos;t exactly Davy Crockett. But I sure as hell startled Sorels. My bullet plowed into the 
top doorjamb of his squad car with a pop and a spark and must have showered him with some debris, because he bellowed 
something I sure wouldn&apos;t want to go down as my last mortal words on earth, and his hand jerked up as he fired his 9- mil 
automatic. One of the other cops yelled &quot; They&apos; re behind us!&quot; and damned if I didn&apos; t hear fear in his voice as well, and that broke 
the spell. Okay, everybody&apos; s got guns and everybody is scared and so let&apos; s take it from there. I can deal with that Sorels whirled 
and I put my next bullet square in his chest Rather to my amazement I was firing single- action, actually cocking the weapon and 
aiming rather than closing my eyes and blasting away on double- action. Carter Wingfield proved himself to be a damned good 
arms instrucbDr on that cold winter afternoon. Sorels was wearing one of the newest super- vests with that odd woven- steel fabric 
in it I had one myself later on and they feel like you&apos;re wearing a snakeskin. They&apos;re light and flexible and impenetrable to 
anything short of a 50-cal. exploder, and they can even sbDp those from about four hundred yards on out At a hundred feet or so 
that vest stopped a .357 Magnum devastator, but the kinetic force of it slammed Sorels back into his own car and sent him sliding 
unconscious bD the ground. The other cops whirled about confused and looking to see where the shots were coming from, and I 
was able to get off a third shot at a ducking trooper before they started shooting back at me, shattering the windshield of the 
Taurus and spraying powdered glass up in my face. By then Sully was down behind a stack of firewood for sale pumping shots 
out of a .45 automatic, and I saw Jonesy leaning down like she was trying to pick something up off the ground. But she wasn&apos;t 
trying bD pick something up; she was rolling something. I jumped back behind another car and fired again, trying bD keep count of 
six in my mind of, and then there was a mighty bang and a state patrol car did the hootchy-kootchy and exploded into flames. 
Jonesy was the kind of girl who carried hand grenades in her purse. 

Having discovered that they had bitten off a wee bit more than they could chew, the state troopers hollered and scattered, a couple 
of them with their pants on fire. I decided it was time for me to do the same. I&apos;d done my bit I hadn&apos; t dodged the bullet in any 
sense of the word, I hadn&apos;t fallen back on General Order Number Eight and I was somewhat proud of myself. I started running 
down Second Street Behind the store a Mexican in a grocery apron was standing there gawking at all the noise, holding a crate of 
leafy produce of some kind, an expression of slack astonishment on his face. Since he had no business being in my country I shot 
him on general principles, and ran on. As I reached the comer of Second and Main I saw the pickup truck with Johnny Pill driving 
turn the comer, and the other two mnning Volunteers piled into the cab. Fortunately it was one of these big tanks yuppies used bD 
get their dumb-ass jock sons in college as a status symbol, so there was plenty of room for three up front but not four In a 
heartbeat I was up on the mnning board and over into the back bed, lying flat and then we were off, fast at first and then slowing 
down as we eased onb) the interstate. We passed Fulton&apos;s market as the sirens wailed in the distance, and as I lay on my back I 
made a note in my mind of the telephone number on their wall. While I enjoyed my bumpy reclining ride I took out my cell phone 
and called them up. &quot;Is this the manager?&quot; I asked. I could hear screaming and shouting and police radios in the background. 
&quot;Uh, this is the assistant manager,&quot; mumbled the guy on the other end, who appeared to be in shock. &quot;We just had a... what can 
I..?&quot; 

&quot;Y ou can quit hiring wetbacks,&quot; I said. 
&quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I&apos;m the guy who just plugged that spic of yours out back,&quot; I yelled over the sound of traffic on the interstate, lying on the bed of 
the pickup. &quot;Y ou will, let me repeat that you will get rid of all of your non-white employees, and you will, let me repeat that you 
will hire white Americans to replace them. Because if you don&apos;t asshole, you are going to see me in person. Y ou just saw what we 
did in your parking lot right?&quot; 
&quot;Bah... bah... bah... &quot; babbled the idiot 

A Distant Thunder 84 



&quot;Next time I come in there I&apos; d better not see one black or brown or yellow face. Otherwise you and me are going to have a quiet 
word of prayer, boy/&apos; I said in my best Carter Wingfield imitation. Then I hung up. 

The one thing that we understood from the start was that we had to hit ZOG where it hurt, in their wallets. Red Morehouse was 
right when he said that the generals never surrender in a colonial war, it&apos; s always the accountants who convince the occupying 
power to throw in the towel. The rich businessmen who owned that supermarket chain could not have cared less about a single 
madrugadore warehouse hand; there were umpteen thousand more where he came from. But they understood that getting their 
stores shot up and their employees murdered on a regular basis was very bad for their bottom line, and already some far-seeing 
men among the Northwest business community were beginning to wrap their minds around the possibility that the mighty United 
States could not protect them from the NV A . Or at least couldn&apos; t protect their bottom line. Profit came first, always, and when 
faced with a combined threat of falling profits and a bullet in the face, the Northwest&apos; s economic ruling elite saw the light very 
quickly. For some odd reason, after we went waltzing Matilda in the parking lot that day with Sorels and his oafs and got away 
with it, all seventeen stores of the Fulton&apos; s Market grocery chain throughout western W ashington subsequently developed a 
remarkably non-diverse hiring policy. They never had a single visible non- white employee for the rest of the War of 
Independence. Wonder why that was? The NAACP and the Hispanic American Council tried to sue them, but the NVA shot the 
lawyers, which put an end to that lark and reinforced the point I first made that day in Dundee. I might also add that this policy 
paid them dividends in the future. Fulton&apos;s is now the largest grocery chain in the Northwest American Republic, and every store 
has a large Tricolor flying prominently from the roof. 

I knew that we weren&apos; t headed for the NVA railroad station hideout we&apos; d been in that morning, because one of the standard 
operating procedures was that when you were hot you never went back to your previous base camp, lest you lead any pursuit to 
your comrades. Everybody had an E&amp;E point and I figured that J ohnny Pill was taking us to his own and we&apos; d sort things out 
from there. It turned out to be the pool house on the sumptuous estate of a corporate executive perched high above Budd Inlet 
John&apos;s lady Mary was the official house- sitter while the big shot and his slutrich-bitchwife were off doing the fleshpots of the 
Pacific Rim on assorted business conferences, and we had the run of the mansion. This was an interesting experience in that for 
the first time I saw how the wealthy had been living while I had been growing up in the repulsive shithole that was Dundee under 
ZOG . Multiple Jacuzzis, 64-inch plasma TVs, marble fixtures, a game room the size of a basketball court, an Olympic length 
heated indoor swimming pool, carpet you could sink in, refrigerators full of food I didn&apos;t even recognize and mangled horribly in 
the microwave, mahogany furniture, brocaded sofas I made it a point to sleep on while wearing my boots, a garden like something 
out of Versailles which was tended by a couple of Chinese whom we had to hide from by day and were forbidden to shoot, you 
get the picture. 

A s per usual we had the TV in the pool house running full time on the cable news channels, and although no one had been killed 
except the Mexican, the media were on an even greater rampage about the Fulton Market fracas than they went into over the dead 
police. It turned out that Sully and J onesy had been recognized in the store because they&apos; d been featured on A merica &apos; s Most 
Wanted the previous Saturday night. They were the NVA&apos;s first celebrity terrorists, &quot;the racist Bonnie and Clyde,&quot; and somebody 
at Fulton&apos; s decided he or she wanted to pick up some rather substantial reward money, so they called the special Domestic 
Terrorist Hotline on an 800 number. Interestingly enough, the Feds always emphasized for informers to call that line and never 
9 11 . Z G knew even that early on that they couldn&apos; t trust the local police in the Northwest. 

On the second night at Budd Inlet, Carter rocked up with another Volunteer whose name I never knew and whose job was to take 
Sully andjonesy out to Montana someplace to cool off for a bit They both sang my praises to the sky as a mighty Aryan warrior 
indeed, and after Jonesy had given me a farewell hug and they&apos; d driven off into the darkness. Carter shook my hand. &quot;Y ou just 
ain&apos; t the type to walk away from white folks in trouble at all, are you, son?&quot; he asked me with a grin. &quot;Y ou did real well, Shane. 
Our little crew is getting quite a rep in the Army and you&apos; re a large part of the reason why. We&apos;re all real proud of you. I have a 
present for you. I believe you once stated that this was your favorite gun among all our collection we used to play Little Willie 
with?&quot; 

&quot;The Tek-9?&quot; I asked excitedly. 

&quot;Naw, that thing is junk. I mean the really nice one.&quot; He took out a beautiful old British Webley, .455 caliber, top- break owl clip, 
square 6- inch barrel. It was a reproduction, of course, but a repro old enough to be an antique in itself, and yet like every firearm 
in the Wingfield arsenal it was in perfect firing condition. I had small, stubby hands and the grip fitted into them better than any 
other pistol butt except for Western- style revolvers, certainly a lot better than most of the more modem weapons. I could control it 
and actually hit things with it I had named the gun King Henry the Fifth after one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. 
&quot;If I&apos; d been packing this, I wouldn&apos;t have missed Sorels on that first shot&quot; I said with a sigh. 

&quot;Well, you won&apos; t miss him again. This is now yours, your first testimonial from a grateful Northwest Republic for services 
rendered. By the way, even though Brother Leon was wearing a vest when you plugged him, you sent that big bad boy to the 
hospital with a torn sternum. A direct hit from a .357 is no joke, even on body armor. His buddies from the patrol are guarding 
him night and day. They know his reputation and they&apos; re scared we&apos; 11 come and finish the job. With any luck you&apos; 11 be able to 
show him K ing Henry here. I got the cleaning kit and three boxes of ammo for you out in the truck. &quot; A nd so K ing Henry became 
my personal handgun for the rest of the war. I had to carry other weapons because ammo for the Webley was hard to come by, and 
by good luck I wasn&apos;t packing it when I was arrested that one time and so my comrades saved it for me and gave it back to me 
later. I have kept His Grace in mint firing condition, and I still sleep with that piece by my bedside to this very day, so that when I 
bite the big one my son or grandson or whoever finds me can put it into my palm and wrap my fingers around it and I can die the 

A Distant Thunder 85 



death of a true Northwest V olunteer, with a gun in my hand. A fter I croak I have left it to the Museum of the Revolution in my 

will. Sometimes when I was carrying that gun I&apos;d wear a tweed golf cap from Ireland on my head, and I felt like I was Michael 

Colhns or Dan Breen hunting down the Black and Tans. I guess maybe I have more Irish in me than just my name. 

When I got back to Dundee we&apos; d changed locations again. This time we were way out in the hills in an old Cascade logging camp 

that had a number of trailers and cabins and hangars, but which had been shut down because of the spotted owls a number of years 

before with the loss of several hundred jobs. Since the Bush family and their big business cronies were making money hand over 

fist importing paper and pulp from Siberia and China, the camp never opened up again, not even with Mexican labor. It was one 

of the best and most comfortable places we ever had, and we had to really watch ourselves and make sure we didn&apos; t get too settled 

in. There was a fire tower and we built a couple of observation posts in the trees that could see all up and down the fire road and 

all along the ridge, and since we had some night vision goggles we&apos; d liberated, no one could sneak up on us. W e could hide all our 

vehicles in the hangars and as long as we didn&apos; t build any fires during the daytime and kept a strict blackout at night to foil ZOG 

spotter copters, we were about as safe as Volunteers could ever be. 

The W ingfields were there, and J ohn, and some of the other V olunteers I&apos; d get to know really well down through the years, like 

Mack the Knife and Tommy Connors, and Sam Maxwell had just escaped and gotten back in contact, so he was able to fill us all 

in with personal, first hand accounts of the Sixteen Days in Coeur d&apos; Alene. There was also Noble Gill, who was another Southern 

settler who had followed the call to the Promised Land in the Northwest. Noble was from the hootin&apos; hollers of the Appalachians 

somewhere. He was a grizzled old man with a white beard who looked like either a Biblical prophet or an insane wino on first 

impression, but he was as hard as nails and one of the bravest and most loyal men I think we ever had in the NV A . He went to war 

quite literally with a gun in one hand and a Bible in the other. He carried by preference an old Ml Garand he&apos;d inherited from his 

father and his father before him. It was W orld W ar Two issue but Noble could still knock a squirrel&apos; s ey e out at ninety feet with it. 

&quot;The Scripture says to smite the enemies of the Lord with a rod of iron,&quot; he&apos;d say. &quot;Nowadays the rod of iron is made by Colt, 

Ruger, and Smith and Wesson.&quot; Noble was a Hardshell Baptist minister and he served as our unit&apos;s chaplain on the occasions 

when anyone felt they needed one. 

Well, Rooney and I finally decided we needed one. 

Carter got a bit nervous about having so many people in one place, and we still had support work to do backing up our out-of- 

towners, and so after a week it was decided it was time for our crew to make like an amoeba and split. To my surprise he and Ma 

decided to head back to Dundee with Tommy Connors, Noble Gill and his wife Lurleen. The second team would consist of China, 

Sam Maxwell as team leader. Mack the Knife and his girl Tracy, and the big guy Teddy the Bear. The Bear didn&apos;t have his M-60 

machinegun yet, but he was shaping up very formidably and he appeared to have a strictly honorable and bashful crush developing 

on China. The third team would consist of myself, Rooney, and Red Morehouse. I arched my eyebrows in an unspoken question. 

Carter answered it. &quot;We&apos; re deliberately breaking ourselves up, Shane,&quot; he told me quietly. &quot;This way if one team is caught and 

arrested, or more likely annihilated the way the Feebs and state cops feel about us now, we won&apos;t lose an entire family in one fell 

swoop. The brutal logic of war. I know I can trust you to look out for Rooney and for that matter I can trust Rooney to look out for 

you, and I feel better with both of you looking out for Red. He&apos; s our Political Officer and he&apos; s the most important man we&apos;ve got. 

Most of what you two will be doing will involve assisting and transporting and bodyguarding Red while he touches all the bases 

that need to be touched for the Party and makes new ones. Don&apos;t worry, he and I will need frequent consultation, and we&apos;ll still be 

seeing a lot of each other.&quot; 

Around sunset that afternoon Rooney came out to where I was sitting on guard duty on a small hill overlooking the winding, 

empty fire road. She dressed in the heighth of partisan fashion, denim jacket and her wartime- approved blue jeans, a plaid shirt 

and tennis shoes, her hair in a single braid down her back, with the tres chic family Beretta in a shoulder holster rig and a slung 

Uzi and canvas magazine pouch. The girl knew how to accessorize. &quot;Looks like we&apos; re gone be teammates from now on,&quot; said 

Rooney. 

&quot;We&apos;ve been teammates for a long time, Roon,&quot; I laughed. 

&quot;Yeah, but... &quot; She blushed. 

&quot;But what?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;This is the first time we&apos; re gone be teammates without Mom and Dad and Chine around,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Oh, I get it. &quot;And I did. 

&quot;My ma says you&apos; re a real gent and I&apos;m damned lucky to have you,&quot; she said. &quot;I know it. All this time we been on the bounce 

you&apos;ve never pushed me, even though I know you want to.&quot; 

&quot;Look, Roon, you know how I feel about you,&quot; I told her. &quot;I told you on the day that Coeur d&apos;Alene went up. I think you feel the 

same way about me. I hope so, anyway, because that&apos; s what&apos; s been carrying me through these past months. But this war has 

messed up all our lives and things aren&apos; t normal. I&apos; d give my right arm to be able to give you a church wedding with the white 

dress and the flowers and the organ and all, but it&apos; s just not possible, and I know how you feel about marriage in your church. I 

will always respect you and respect your faith. Y ou know that. Y ou don&apos; t have to worry about being together with me without 

your Mom and Dad. I&apos; 11 stay a gentleman as long as it takes.&quot; 

&quot;I know, Shane, and that&apos; s one of the reasons it ain&apos; t right to make you wait any more,&quot; she said. &quot;Look, Mom and Dad are very 

practical people. They know I&apos; m a grown woman now and they like you and approve of you. They always have, ever since that 

day in the park when you didn&apos; t turn your back and walk away like the other white boys when I had black nigger trouble and 

A Distant Thunder 86 



white nigger trouble. They know I&apos;m gone do whatl&apos;m gone do, but... &quot; She looked at me. &quot;Do you mean itwhenyou say you 

want to marry me?&quot; 

&quot;You know I do/&apos; I told her. 

&quot;Marriage is a sacrament between two people in the eyes of God. That&apos;s all it takes, those two people and God. Dad asked me a 

favor just now, and that was that if you&apos; d agree, before him and his team leave for Dundee tonight, if we could go and see Noble 

G ill. He&apos; s a preacher and he can say the words. That&apos; s all they&apos; re asking of us. It&apos; s just a few spoken words, but they&apos; re important 

words, because they have to be spoken where God hears them and other people hear them.&quot; 

&quot;Y ou got it,&quot; I told her. Tommy relieved me half an hour later, and we went and found old man Gill loading one of the trucks 

getting ready to leave. We stood before him holding hands. &quot;You really a preacher. Noble?&quot; I asked him. 

&quot;I am,&quot; growled the old man. &quot;Gotthecall when I was about your age, back in Tennessee. Been preaching the gospel for forty 

years now, and I have never taken one thin dime for it That&apos; s one mark of The Beast, you know. Priestcraft. There ain&apos; t nothing in 

the Bible about a cash register, and Jesus himself took up a whip to drive the Jew money-changers out of the temple. God is love, 

my ass! God is righteousness, and that ain&apos;t the same thing.&quot; 

&quot;Well, we need a preacher,&quot; Rooney told him, &quot;Me and Shane are going up in that trailer tonight, and I reckon it&apos; s your Christian 

duty to marry us beforehand so we don&apos;t sin.&quot; 

T he old man looked at me like an owl sizing up a mouse for dinner. &quot; Y oung man, A mbrose B ierce warn&apos; t no prophet, warn&apos; t even 

no Christian, but he had a way with words. He once defined a husband as a man who, having dined, is thenceforth charged with 

perpetual care of the plate. Is this a plate you want perpetual care of?&quot; 

&quot;As perpetual as it gets,&quot; I said. 

&quot;And you, young lady. I do things the old way and I ain&apos;t takin&apos; the word obey out of the rixual. None of that feminist horse shit 

even if you gals are carrying guns for the time being. Things ain&apos;t always gone be hke this, and when time comes for us all to go 

back to the natural way for our people to live, you&apos; re damned well gone go back. Y ou got a mulish streak in you. I seen it. I marry 

you two, he wears the pants in the household. Y ou got that?&quot; 

&quot;I got it,&quot; said Rooney. I figured I&apos; d best keep my mouth shut 

&quot;Okay, let&apos; s go git yer folks and do the deed,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Uh, sir, I think to be fair I should mention that at least technically speaking, I&apos; m a Roman Catholic. About the 

only thing my father&apos;s family kept from Ireland.&quot; 

&quot;So were Martin Luther and John Calvin and John Knox at one time,&quot; chuckled Gill. &quot;You&apos; re in good company. This ain&apos;t Ireland, 

son, and we all got other things to worry about That&apos; s what I keep telling our comrades who want us all to dance around wearing 

homed helmets and drinking mead.&quot; 

&quot;What about wedding rings? I don&apos;t have any.&quot; 

&quot;Best notto use &apos;em,&quot; said Noble. &quot;They&apos;re potentially identifying markers thatThe Beast might use againstyou someday. Don&apos;t 

worry, young man, the Lord and your family will know you&apos;re married, and you&apos;ll know it Thats all that counts. All the rest of it 

is nice to have, but superfluous to requirement A fter the war is over and The B east is slain you two can renew your vows in a 

proper church with all the trimmings. If you make it&quot; 

So we went inside the main cabin, and in the paneled walls of what used to be the logging company manager&apos; s office, with 

everyone gathered around who wasn&apos;t on guard. The old man pulled a rat-eared and now completely illegal King James Bible out 

of his coat pocket and held it out &quot;Kneel down and putyour right hand on the book, both of yez,&quot; he commanded. We did so, 

holding each other&apos; s hands with our left &quot;This being a time of war for our Folk, we gone make this quick. Dearly beloved, we are 

gathered here in the sight of God and all you here assembled to unite this man and this woman in the bonds of holy etcetera, 

etcetera. Shane Ryan, do you take Rooney Wingfield here to be your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold, for richer or for 

poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, to honor and respect to protect and succor in her every need, never to 

renounce nor shame her, until death do you part?&quot; 

&quot;I do,&quot; I said with all my heart and soul. 

&quot;Rooney Wingfield, do you take Shane Ryan here to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, 

to honor and obey, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to be the staff of life upon which he shall lean in his time of 

trouble, and never to renounce or to shame him, until death do you part?&quot; 

&quot;I do,&quot; she said. God forgive me, even after all the years we had known one another I tried to read her voice, to imagine what she 

was really thinking. 

&quot;I now pronounce you man and wife.&quot; I got kiss number five and we had our wedding feast which consisted of a two family 

buckets of fried chicken, coleslaw, and microwaved mashed potatoes with gravy that looked and tasted like diesel oil, and several 

large plastic jugs of diet cola served out in Styrofoam cups with no ice. Rooney got hugs from her mother and sister and I got my 

hand shaken by all the men, and before they left Carter and Ma gave us our wedding present— Caprice, the family Doberman, 

would be going with our little trio. After they were gone I turned to Martin Morehouse and said, &quot;Uh, Red, under the 

circumstances, would you mind taking the first watch? I&apos; 11 relieve you at midnight&quot; 

&quot;See you then,&quot; he said with a somber nod, hefting his shotgun and pulling on his coat to go up onto the hill. At the door Red 

turned. &quot;I guess you both know that I think the world of you two. Dear God, I hope this works out and you have a wonderful and 

happy future life together! &quot; 

A Distant Thunder 87 



&quot;That&apos; s what we want too, Red. Why do you think we&apos; re out here in the woods with all these guns?&quot; asked Rooney with a smile. 
Then I took her hand and led her out to the trailer. 

The next morning Rooney and I watched the dawn come up together, sitting on the ground beneath a Douglas fir, arms around one 
another and rifles on our knees, watching for the evil men from an evil empire who wanted to kill us. It was freezing, but neither 
of us felt it, and we had Caprice between us as a hot water bottle anyway. The sun burned through the fog and by the time we 

pulled out of camp in our nice roomy SUV, the sky above us was the deepest and purest blue. 

* * * 

For the next few months Rooney and I stuck close to Red Morehouse. We carried messages he didn&apos; t want transmitted over a 
phone or a computer even in code, and we ran assorted errands. We went on some minor tickles involving not too much in the 
way of mayhem, and we spent as much time together as we could. It was almost an extended honeymoon, except at any given 
time it could all have been blown to hell when ZOG came through the door. It was the most relatively sedate period I had during 
the war. We did a fair amount of traveling, driving by night from safe house to safe house, mostly up to Oly and Seattle but once 
or twice as far down as northern California and once out to Idaho, where we were able to fit in a quick reunion visit with Adam 
Wingfield. This was in the days before FATPO landed and the checkpoints weren&apos;t anywhere near as numerous, mostly being 
thrown up in the vicinity of a recent NV A tickle after the fact, and so we were usually warned what locales to avoid. Most of our 
job consisted of providing transport and cover while Red met with a succession of small groups and individuals in private homes 
and apartments, in the back rooms of restaurants and bars, on park benches, in motel rooms, at scenic overlooks, in churches, once 
on a train and once in a tanning salon, of all places. Rooney and I didn&apos; t sit in on that end of it much. That wasn&apos;t our job; we 
stood by and kept watch. But in later years I would sometimes see some high functionary or politician&apos; s picture in the paper or on 
the screen and I &apos; d recall a much younger version of that face in some back room of a greasy spoon, or looming out of liie rain 
under a street light Red moved in some important circles. 

What was happening was that the Party was quietly setting up the mechanics and logistics of a long-haul strategy to free our 
Homeland. We now had one advantage over the pre-10/22 period, in that at least now we knew how &quot;it&quot; was going to happen. We 
knew we wouldn&apos;t be deahng with some kind of bizarre post- apocalyptic road warrior science fiction scenario, nor would we be 
dealing with any kind of nationwide mass uprising against the regime. No space aliens, no biological warfare plagues, no post- 
apocalyptic world. Straight colonial war of a small nation for independence against a larger occupying power, just like the Old 
Man had predicted, and for that there were plenty of encouraging historical precedents. A unified strategic plan had to be 
formulated on the assumption that the Zionist regime in America would remain more or less intact, although that was by no means 
certain, and that our task was to persuade that regime that letting the Northwest go was the lesser of two evils. &quot;They&apos; re thinking 
in terms of a thirty year war,&quot; Red told us grimly once, referring to the Party leadership. &quot;We hope it doesn&apos;t last that long, but we 
have to assume worst case scenario and plan for it, and then if it doesn&apos; t take that long we can be pleasantly surprised.&quot; 
The term sedate doesn&apos;t mean I got no action at all. I did some driving on a few hits for Carter in Lewis County and Terry Jackson 
down in Longview, plus one in Portland that got hairy. At that time Portland had a high-yellow city councilman named Toodles 
Taliaferro— no, look it up, I swear ma&apos; am, I am not making this up! That was his name. It&apos; s in all the history books. A ny way, 
Toodles was not only high-yellow and as politically correct and lefty on every issue as it was possible to be, he was a sodomite 
and actually &quot;married&quot; to his &quot;partner,&quot; a white doctor who was— need I say it?— a proctologist. Okay, ma&apos; am, you can laugh all 
you want. But you wouldn&apos; t laugh if you actually had blobs of worthless protoplasm like that governing you and teaching their 
perversions to your children. Toodles had been on the Portland Brigade&apos; s to do list for a while and they were about to take care of 
it when they were hit with really heavy police and FBI raids, some arrested and a lot more having to go on the bounce, and they 
were so short handed they asked Carter for my services as a wheel man. It was the policy of the NVA that every time we took a 
major hit, we always hit back equally heavy in the same area and we did so immediately, even if there was only one Volunteer left 
in a unit and we had to import a hundred others from elsewhere. ZOG must never be left with any pretension to crow about in the 
media that they had destroyed or eliminated us, anywhere. Like that time Calvin Freeman was the only member of C Company in 
Spokane who escaped a dragnet, and he eased his body on into the local television station the next night when the local TV news 
personality was cackling about it on the air. Volunteer Freeman walked onto the set and dropped anchor right on the six o&apos; clock 
news with a .45 slug in the asshole&apos;s perfectly coiffured and blow-dried head. Now that&apos; s entertainment! 
Anyway, that night Toodles makes this big speech in the council chambers, televised, of course, praising the cops and FBI for 
their actions against the NVA and denouncing evil racism and domestic terrorism in general. Then he calls his &quot;husband&quot; up onto 
the stage and gives him a big hug and a slurpy French kiss and he shouts, &quot;I have a message for every racist and homophobic bigot 
in Portland&apos; s fair city! Our love will conquer your hate! &quot; For this, those two pervs got a thunderous standing ovation from the 
crowd which played well on the eleven o&apos; clock news. Until the lovefest was interrupted to announce that they had been both been 
shot dead as they strolled hand in hand up to their pretty little gentrified house in a Victorian historic section of north Portland. 
The damned idiots had made this big ranting, raving public attack on the Northwest Volunteer Army, the entire white race, and 
every basic concept of decency for the past two thousand years, they knew we were out and about, and they went home with no 
police protection. To this day the breathtaking contempt that those two faggots displayed for us frosts my cookies. They deserved 
to die for that insult alone. Did they think it was all a joke? Did they think we were some drunken skinheads who could be safely 
defied? Did they think this was the radical Sixties when words didn&apos;t mean anything? Well, those candy-ass fools found out 
differently. They screamed and blubbered hke babies when Big Jim McCann from Portland A Company and a kid named Ace 

A Distant Thunder 88 



from B Company (who were admittedly just about the only shooters Portland had left that night) cut their foul perverted bodies in 
half with double- ought buckshot at close range. 

I don&apos;t know who was driving for Big Jim, but I was behind the wheel for Ace. Somebody must have seen the Toyota Camry I 
was driving and snitched on us, because we hit the bubble gum machine as I headed back to the drop- off and we ended up in a car 
chase with me roaring down Lombard Street at midnight with half a dozen squad cars after me. The Portland cops never did 
accept a Lewis-style arrangement, at least not the force as a whole. Too many non-whites and political appointees. I figured I&apos; d 
better do something before they set up a roadblock or called in a chopper on us— the longer a pursuit lasts, the less chance the 
pursued has. So I did a U-turn and rammed the car into one of the police cars and Ace and I had to bail and bop our way out. 
Fortunately Carter had lent me the Tek-9 and some magazines, and we had enough firepower to make it. I shot another cop that 
night, but I only wounded him. Portland didn&apos; t know how many of our safe houses were still safe and which ones had been 
compromised, and so I walked the streets for the next day like a wino, with the city in a hippy- dippy politically correct lefty 
uproar over two dead bugger boys, and the whole damned police force looking for evildoing me. Carter had to come and pick me 
up on a street downtown the next night and take me back to Dundee. 

There was nothing on the scale of the Rothstein hit, just enough evildoing to make sure ZOG never forgot we were around. 
Largely we kept our heads down and played everything in a fairly low key. &quot;If we can survive this first year we can make it the 
whole way,&quot; said Carter grimly. ZOG never quite seemed to know what to make of us during that first year after 10/22. They 
appeared genuinely stunned that the white peasantry could revolt. They were used to hearing dem gentle honkies singin&apos; Old Pink 
Joe on their way back from the fields at night while massa and de rabbi sat on the veranda with mint juleps in their hand, but now 
Old Pink Joe done broke de plantation, the drums were beating in the deep swamp and there was the smoke of burning and blood 
in the air. The authorities tried everything they&apos;d been doing before, only more of the same. More anti-terrorism and hatecrime 
laws by the bushel, of course. The prison nickel went up to a dime, ten years for possession of &quot;printed matter likely to be of use 
to terrorists&quot; with a full twenty years for possession of the Protocols, an unlicensed King James Bible (certain libraries were 
allowed to have strictly controlled copies of both) or a video of Mel Gibson&apos;s The Pass/on of the Christ. They even introduced a 
Federal statute that went beyond thoughtcrime and embraced the old 1984 Orwellian offense of facecrime, by prohibiting &quot;silent 
communication through body language and facial expression of support for domestic terrorism, of silent contempt for the 
government of the United States or the President of the United States, silent contempt expressed through body language or facial 
expression directed against racial, religious, or sexual minorities in such a manner as to inflict mental anguish,&quot; etc. They actually 
had a television campaign about this new law to the music of &quot;Put On A Happy Face,&quot; although that one was so ridiculous even 
by ZOG standards that I don&apos;t know if anyone was ever prosecuted for it. 

The media&apos;s spin was alternately syrupy sentimental patriotic and thunderously raging and threatening. The NVA&apos;s imminent 
demise was always just around the comer, if you believed the talking heads on the tube. Every couple of months there would be a 
spate of spectacular FBI and police raids, and some of our people would be caught or killed, more often than not along with a 
number of completely innocent bystanders since the Feds were notoriously trigger-happy. Afterward there would always be a big 
press conference with unctuous- looking suits looking like the cat who&apos; d got the cream, reading proud boastful statements about 
how they were about to squash the NVA and the Party like bugs. There would be long tables of allegedly captured guns and 
ammunition and explosives laid out for display for the benefit of the cameras, along with Tricolors and assorted &quot;hate literature&quot; 
spangled with swastikas. There was a bit of a contretemps when an inquisitive reporter who had attended several of these 
conferences became suspicious, and he took a close look at several of the weapons. He then pointed out to the FBI master of 
ceremonies, on live camera, that they had the same serial numbers as weapons displayed in previous such dog and pony shows as 
having been captured from the NVA in different raids. The United States Attorney general was properly outraged at such 
deception and took immediate corrective action to rectify the situation: the insolent reporter was indicted and arrested under the 
Patriot Act 

Then one warm day in June Red told us to drive him out to the old logging camp. It was the first time we had been back there 
since Rooney and I were married, but I understood that other crews were using it from time to time. &quot;There&apos;s a pow-wow tonight, 
more of our people than I like to see in one place, but there&apos; s somebody we need to meet,&quot; Red told us. Sure enough, when we 
started to pull in off the fire road we were stopped by a couple of salty- looking Volunteers I&apos; d never seen before with M- 1 6s. They 
knew Red and waved him on through. There were about fifty Volunteers in the camp, more than had been together in Lewis 
County since 10/22. 

We gathered in one of the hangars that had served the logging company as a warehouse. The guy we had come to meet was a 
thirty- something man, short and powerful with ice- blue eyes. What hair he had left on the right side of his skull was red and cut 
short. He has a very bad bum scar that covered the left side of his face and the back of his head. It made him look like a cave man. 
There was a kind of platform at one end of the hangar made from plywood. No idea what the logging company used it for. Red got 
up and addressed us. &quot;Comrades, I have some important news. It&apos;s showtime. Lewis County has been upgraded by the Army 
Council into an operational area and Company E is now officially an active service unit.&quot; This was greeted with enthusiastic 
cheers and applause. &quot;CarterWingfield will be moving up to assume quartermaster duties forthe South Sound Brigade, so he&apos;ll be 
spending more time in Olympia and Tacoma. He will also be promoted to the rank of lieutenant. His replacement as company 
quartermaster will be the gentleman sitting back there who looks like the evil Santa Claus with the tattoos. His Volunteer name is 
Smackwaterjack.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 89 



&quot;Just call me Smack,&quot; called out Smack. &quot;I ain&apos; t no lieutenant or sergeant of nothing. I&apos; m just the Smack.&quot; There were a lot of 
guys like Smack who refused any formal rank. I was one of them, when I was offered it on occasion. Volunteer was always good 
enough for me. 

&quot;I myself will be assuming the duties of brigade Political Officer, so you will be seeing somewhat less of me as well down here, 
although as far as I am concerned Lewis is my home and my home base,&quot; Red went on. &quot;Y ou have been called here in order to 
meet our new commander for Echo Company, Lieutenant Dorsey Thompson. He was a lieutenant in the United States army as 
well, is Ranger trained and he has extensive combat experience, he has carried out a number of successful missions for the NVA, 
and he has now been given the assignment of creating and implementing a combat strategy for the liberation of Lewis County 
from the occupation forces. Lewis and the odd point north and south as may become practical. As I said, from now on E Company 
is to be classified as an active service unit, although we will still have a large support contingent which should actually grow with 
time.&quot; 

&quot;Are we going to get one of those Flying Columns in Lewis County that we keep hearing about on the grapevine?&quot; asked Teddy 
the Bear. 

&quot;Not right away, troop,&quot; replied Thompson, stepping forward with confidence and ease. &quot;That may well be on the cards for the 
future, though. Captain Morehouse introduced me as Dorsey Thompson, but you comrades can call me Tank. I picked up that 
handle because I was a tank commander in Egypt and the Gaza Strip a few years ago, back when I was stupid enough to fight for 
The Beast. One day my vehicle ran over a home-made mine of about a thousand pounds of home-made napalm. I was the only one 
of the crew who survived, and that&apos; s where this comes from,&quot; he said, pointing at his face. &quot;I might have something of a face left 
if Uncle Sam hadn&apos;t been trying to cut back on expensive medical care for wounded Crusaders and decided that a full rebuild 
constituted &apos;cosmetic surgery inessential to the well being and performance of the soldier.&apos; I believe was the term they used. 
Needless to say, I haven&apos;t been too hepped on Amurrica since tiien, and my wife even less so. 

&quot;As the captain informed you, from this point on Lewis County is a designated operational theater for the NVA. Strategically, our 
objective is simple,&quot; Tank went on. &quot;Interstate 5 is the main artery for this part of the world between California and the Canadian 
border. Since the United States so foolishly destroyed its rail system in the last century in favor of these big eighteen-wheeled 
monsters that bum tons of oil and put mega- billions into the pockets of the Bush family and their cronies, the overwhelming 
majority of all freight and all passenger traffic on the west coast goes up and down 1-5 at one point or another. We are going to 
choke off that artery. We are going to cut off enemy movement and supply on the ground between Portland and the Seattle 
metroplex areas. We are going to make it as difficult as possible for ZOG to move men and material through here. We are going to 
turn this part of western Washington into flyover country for them. When we are through, every member of the United States 
military and anyone affiliated with the United States government will go miles out of their way to avoid Lewis County. We may 
not be able to accomplish this completely at first, but we will eventually create a solid block of support and a safe refuge for the 
Republic&apos; s forces in this county. The people of the county will support us, for the simple reason that those who do not will no 
longer be resident here, one way or another. We will also use Lewis County as a staging area from which the NVA can mount 
major operations both northwards towards the enemy concentrations in Olympia and Tacoma, and southward against Portland and 
the Columbia river basin with its power plants and medium- level towns such as The Dalles. This is part of the Army Council&apos;s 
overall strategy of isolating ZOG in the large metro plexes and rendering movement and control of the white population by the 
A mericans difficult at first, and then impossible. Our effort here in Lewis is a kind of pilot project, a laboratory in which we will 
experiment with methods for clearing away American rule from a largely rural area, and replacing it with our own. 
&quot;Accordingly, there will be a re-organization of the company here. Y ou will be assigned either to one of five combat teams, or 
else to a support unit C omrades, please don&apos; t believe that if we put you on a support team we think any the less of you. In fact, it 
will mean that we think well of your own special skills and strong points. I know that every one of you has the courage of a lion, 
or you wouldn&apos; t be here today. Support is vitally necessary. The combat teams will be taking this war of independence right to the 
enemy, but they will urgently need support fighters to pass them the ammunition. Nor is assignment to support chiseled in stone. 
The fact is that there will be casualties in the combat squads, as there already have been all over the Homeland. Don&apos;t worry, if 
you still want to pull a trigger in a few months, there will be open slots for you. For the rest of this evening Red and Carter and I 
will be speaking with all of you about your new assignments.&quot; 

Later on Red took me and Rooney aside. &quot;Look, guys, you&apos;ve really done well with me over the past few months,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d 
like to keep you on my personal staff and bump you both up to sergeant I might also add that if you stick with me, you&apos; 11 be a lot 
closer to the center of the action in this little revolution of ours and a lot better placed to move up in your careers after we estabUsh 
the Repubhc. Y ou&apos; 11 get to meet with a lot of the top people in the Party, and you&apos; 11 make contacts that will stand you in good 
stead for the rest of your lives.&quot; He didn&apos;t mention that while there would be a high degree of danger, on a day to day basis we&apos; d 
be more or less out of the direct line of fire and thus somewhat safer. I wondered if that thought had crossed his mind. Or Carter&apos; s. 
I had already made up my mind. &quot;Red, you know I&apos; 11 go wherever the Party orders me to go and do what I&apos;m ordered to do, but I 
want to stay here in the place I was bom and fight against these bastards who have made my life such hell. I never thought about a 
career. Never had any reason to with these Jew bastards mnning the country. All Amurrica could ever find for me top do was mop 
the floors of burger joints and unload their damned tmcks full of cheap foreign plastic junk, and yeah, I want something better 
than that But right now we got a war to win. When its over, then I&apos; 11 think about those things. ButRoon, I&apos;ll lay this on the line,&quot; 
I said, tuming to her. &quot; Y ou&apos; re smart as a whip, you deserve to move up, and I think you could do a lot of good working with Red 

A Distant Thunder 90 



and the Political Bureau, and even though it means we&apos; d be apart a lot I&apos; d feel a hell of a lot better if you were off behind the 
scenes somewhere and I didn&apos;t have to worry about you getting down and dirty in the streets.&quot; 

She shook her head. &quot;It don&apos; t work that way, Shane. We&apos; re married. I meant it and you better did too, or I&apos; 11 kick your ass. Y ou 
ain&apos;t shoving me into the background. Whither thou goest, there go I,&quot; she said. 
&quot;That from the Bible, Roon?&quot; I said with a smile. 

&quot;I don&apos; t know. But it&apos; s my answer.&quot; She turned to Red. &quot;I appreciate your concern and Dad&apos; s. Red, but I am Shane&apos; s wife, and if 
he goes to a combat squad, I go to the same combat squad.&quot; So after some discussion between us and Tank and Red and Carter, 
we were teamed withjohnny Pill and a new man from Chehahs who used the name Ajax. John&apos;s girl Mary would be our 
unofficial support attache and runner. Girl, hell. She was forty-five if she was a day, but a good old gal I always liked. 
Up until now in my ramblings, I&apos;ve mentioned the names of a lot of my old comrades because I&apos; d met them in the Chowder 
Society or at our backwoods shooting parties or on litter and spray-paint runs, and I knew who they were prior to 10/22. But from 
that point on we almost never knew the real names of anybody we worked with, only noms de guerre, and Ajax was a good 
example. I never did find out what his real name was, and I&apos; m not really sure I wanted to know. Ajax was a chubby-looking guy 
auburn- haired guy with very white skin and horn- rimmed glasses and acne, a little older than me, but he still wasn&apos; t shaving. He 
had a twinkle in his eye and a merry laugh. He looked like the standard fat nerd comic relief from a teenage gross- out movie or 
else your typical computer geek, which is a good way to look if you don&apos;t want some Fed or some red, white and blue asshole to 
suspect anything right up until the point where you blow his brains out. He joined the NVA after 10/22, personally recruited by 
Red, which was as good a reference as any Volunteer could give, but by the time we teamed up he had already made his bones 
several times over, and so we could therefore reasonably assume he wasn&apos;t an informer. This was back in the days when they were 
still going through the motions of putting any of us that they caught on trial, or some of us, anyway. The ones of us they didn&apos;t 
murder in prison. It didn&apos;t look good in court for the government&apos; s star witness to have killed people. Later on neither the FBI nor 
FATPO had any scruples at all about allowing their operatives to commit the odd murder in order to win an NVA rep and work 
his way in. 

Ajax was a kind you&apos; d meet on occasion in the NVA, a genuine stone killer. I don&apos;t mean a gory tattooed psycho like 0. C. 
Oglevy and that crew from Hay den Lake who routinely perpetrated crude jests with bleeding body parts, but a guy who could 
shoot two people in the back of the head and then go clean out a breakfast buffet while he talked about the lost world of Atlantis. I 
don&apos;t know how he got that way, or any of them. Sometimes I think all the computer games kids played back then, where you shot 
at virtual monsters and people and tried to kill them and blow them up, gave my generation a world class sociopathic streak. Okay, 
granted, I wasn&apos;t exactly Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm myself, and neither was Rooney. Hell, I learned how to pound Bobby 
Fernandez&apos; s head to a pulp with a concrete block from watching wrestling on TV. But while somebody like that can be a real asset 
in a crew like ours, you&apos;re never quite comfortable around them. For all I know, maybe he wasn&apos;t comfortable around me. But I 
had to do the resurrection shuffle for a while after the Rothstein hit, and I was kind of relieved when I got back to Lewis County 
and found Ajax had been transferred up to Seattle where there was plenty of work for good shooters who were totally without 
anything remotely resembling a scruple. 

The re-organization took place in June, eight months after Coeur d&apos; Alene, and it was a sign that the Party was recovering from the 
glorious disaster of the Sixteen Days and starting to get our act together. For the next few years my comrades and I devoted 
ourselves to the single-minded objective of detaching Lewis County, Washington from the United States of America and making 
the RepubUc a reahty. And we did it.

Right about here, this gets kind of difficult for me, ma&apos;am. Logically I suppose I should give you a day by day and blow by blow 
account of everything that Rooney and I did as Volunteers in an active service unit. But there&apos;s a couple of problems with that. For 
one thing, I honest to G od can&apos; t remember where I was and what I was doing every single day of the war. It was seventy years 
ago, and what I mainly recall from that time in my life was a lot of driving around, a lot of crappy food heated in microwave 
ovens, enough black coffee so I&apos; m sure I must have poisoned myself, sleepless nights of guard duty sitting at windows or out in 
the woods or in some doorway on a rainy street, long intervals of boredom where we were preparing to go out and do something 
and then moments of really frantic action when we were out doing something. Both sides spent most of their time trying to sneak 
up on one another and kill by surprise. It could all happen so fast you&apos; d be dead and not even know it. There was a constant low 

A Distant Thunder 91 



level of fear, of nen^ous apprehension even when we seemed to be temporarily safe, and it became a kind of constant background 
of life, something you just accepted like a minor toothache that never went away. Ever try living day in and day out with a 
toothache? Anyone on either side who says he wasn&apos; t scared is either a psycho or more likely a damned liar. It wore your nerves 
to fiddle strings. Rooney and I were lucky. We turned towards one another, not against each other. A lot of those field-couples 
didn&apos; t make it. China and Ted didn&apos; t They only lasted a few months, although they never had a preacher like Rooney and I, which 
was apparently her idea rather than his. Carter didn&apos;t approve of that and Ma damned sure didn&apos;t, but China in her own quiet way 
was the truly stubborn one, and the war had made her an adult at fifteen. Under ZOG, some kids never grew up, their whole lives; 
hfe was kind of one long extended adolescence. That&apos;s another thing we ended. 

Rooney and I used to fantasize about a dirty weekend. After the revolution was won, we decided were going to go off to a motel 
somewhere by the sea. There we would stock up on food and soft drinks for a week, put up the Do Not Disturb sign, and we were 
going to have our own little orgy where we could actually take off all our clothes and make love without constantly looking at our 
watches and listening for sounds outside and not have to grab our guns and scope the sitch if Clarice started barking. A fter we got 
it on we could both go to sleep together at the same time, neither of us on guard, with no weapons in reach, and then we could get 
dressed and go for a walk on the beach and go to a restaurant and sit down and have a meal and then go back to the room and get 
it on some more and not have to worry about death and torture coming through the door. That was our fantasy. I am sorry to say 
we never took it as far as a home and children. We both understood that we did not have that privilege at that point in time and 
that to do so would cause us only pain, and so we avoided it. 

A fter all this time it&apos; s just kind of run together in my mind. Y eah, I remember certain tickles better than others, and I&apos; 11 try to tell 
you about them, but I suppose about the best thing I can do is to describe in a general sense what we did and why we did it. At 
least so far as I understood it from the spear- toting end down on the ground. If you want all the deep strategic thinking you can go 
to the library and check out a whole stack of war memoirs. I think every member of GHQ who survived the war wrote a book you 
could crack open a turtle with. Well, I suppose they have the right. They beat the bastards, after all. 

How do you defeat the mightiest empire that the world has ever known, on its home ground, with only a handful of brave men and 
women and virtually nothing else? Audace, audace, toujours I&apos;audace! Audacity always. That was Danton at the beginning of the 
French Revolution. Danton lost his nerve, and in the end he lost his head. The NVA never lost our nerve, we kept our heads, and 
we won. 

We were always audacious, and like the British commando motto, fortune favors the brave. I can&apos;t remember the Latin on that 
one. Audacity plus a heavy dose of just plain mad dog meanness. We made sure that the enemy was scared of us, that when they 
went out on patrol or on a stakeout they hoped and prayed they did not have to meet us. Red Morehouse had described our coming 
strategy often enough in the Chowder Society get-togethers before the balloon went up in Coeur d&apos; Alene: &quot;Remember, boys and 
girls, what we&apos; re doing is fighting a colonial war. There are rules and precedents aplenty from the last century in fighting and 
winning a colonial war, if we can only have the good sense to see them, and thank God we&apos; re finally acquiring that kind of 
practical sense, even if it&apos; s at the eleventh hour and the fifty- ninth minute. We are not trying to destroy a huge tyrannical 
government and an evil empire completely. That is beyond our capacity to accomplish, largely thanks to the fact that we spent the 
sixty years after the end of the Second World War screwing around, but we won&apos; t get into that. What we are now attempting to do 
is to persuade an occupying power to give up a specific piece of geography because that power is old, tired, confused, and 
eventually giving the territory up will seem like the line of least resistance.&quot; 

&quot;So how do we persuade the United States that giving up the Northwest is the line of least resistance?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Generals never surrender in a colonial war, Shane,&quot; he told us for what must have been the fiftieth time. &quot;The accountants do. 
G iven courage and tenacity and a little luck on the part of the insurgents, eventually it simply becomes too expensive for the 
occupying power to maintain its hold on the colony, too expensive not just in money but in manpower, political capital, and 
prestige. Right now the United States is so embroiled with what appears to be the last-ditch effort to save Israel from destruction 
that when the balloon finally goes up here in the Northwest, the government in Washington will probably consider the threat to its 
continental borders to be of less import than saving the Zionists&apos; bacon. Our strategic goal will be to force an American 
withdrawal from the Northwest by simply making it too damned inconvenient for them to stay.&quot; 
How do you knock down a wall of tyranny? The first thing you have to do is to figure out what&apos; s holding it up. 
In the case of the United States, the entire social and political structure rested on one foundation only— the almighty dollar. The 
only thing that even remotely approached any kind of spiritual or moral values in A merica was the religious right&apos; s weird version 
of messianic J udaeo- Christianity, and they were always a minority since most people could see they had a few screws loose. But 
beyond that tiie people of Lewis County simply didn&apos;t have that much motivation to fight for a system that had been screwing 
them all their lives. Even though they were forbidden by the Dees Act and a hundred other repressive laws from saying what they 
felt out loud, almost all white people were sickened and enraged by what they saw around them every day and the way ZOG made 
them live. A large number of the locals were always secretly cheering us on. The majority of the residents wouldn&apos; t help us 
directly, at least until it became clear that we were going to win. But neither would they oppose us, and neither would they help 
The Beast. The odds were against us, true, but not as much as you might think. ZOG was always a lot weaker and a lot more 
vulnerable than anyone ever imagined, and when we really got started under Tank Thompson&apos; s aggressive new leadership, we 
discovered that we had never fully known our own strength. I always thought it ironic that ZOG always seemed to understand our 
threat potential so much more than we ourselves did. 

A Distant Thunder 92 



The trick was to bring down the system, not just chip away at it That meant we had to figure out who and what to target and that 
didn&apos;t mean a lot of spectacular Fulton&apos;s Market style shootouts with cops. Cops and later FATPO were basically annoyances and 
interruptions of our work that we tried to avoid whenever we could, so we could concentrate on the business of bringing down The 
Beast Okay, FATPO was a real annoyance. But Red had been right that one night Cowardice had nothing to do with it Our job 
wasn&apos;t just to slaughter our enemies, but to create our new nation. The fact is that ZOG didn&apos;t care about its soldiers. They were 
expendable as toilet paper, and with the massive unemployment all across the empire, the regime could always buy more. The 
Feds didn&apos; t care how many cops or soldiers or even Fatties we killed. We had to hit them where they cared. 
To begin with, we focused our attacks not against specific operations of the Zionist governments control apparatus, but on the 
classes of people, the institutions, and the infrastructure that kept the power structure afloat Foremost among these were the 
masses of no n- whites, mostly illegal Third World immigrants, who provided the cheap labor that kept the capitalist system viable 
and provided a disincentive for change among the wealthy people who actually ran the country. We hit the businessmen and the 
corporations that hired them, the wealthy ruling elite who were completely mercenary and who we knew could be persuaded to 
change sides once it became clear that there was a serious threat to their money. When the accountants finally decided the U. S. 
needed to pull out of the Northwest it was the wealthy elite who would deliver the message to the pohtical echelon, so persuading 
them was a major priority. After the non-whites in importance came the media. Then came lawyers and the legal system, and 
above all the tyrants in the black robes. The corrupt and venal politicians. The Internal Revenue Service and the tax collection 
machinery and financial infrastructure. The J udaeo- Christian churches and those damned false prophet preachers and televangelists 
who shrieked and scammed for Israel. That s where we concentrated our fire. If I had to pick out any one factor that contributed to 
the victory of the NVA and the birth of the Northwest Republic, I&apos;d say it was single- mindedness on our part. We always kept our 
eyes on the prize and we didn&apos; t let ourselves get sidetracked into mayhem for the sake of mayhem. 
The first thing we did was to clear Lewis County of non-whites, which reaped the NVA an immense propaganda and public 
relations bonus. First the presence of non- whites gave the regime a pool of potential informers, supporters, and combatants to use 
against us, and we had to cut the government off from that resource. Second, the clearance showed our power. We gave an order 
to the muds to be gone, and by God they got gone and ZOG was clearly powerless to stop it Third, it made the NVA very popular 
indeed and gained us many recruits. Nobody in the Northwest actually liked being overrun with Third World immigrants who 
didn&apos;t speak our language, who undermined our way of life, who took our jobs, got all kinds of free benefits denied to white 
people, sold drugs, and caused a rash of families with mestizo grandchildren. Asa final bonus, with the non-whites gone that 
meant more jobs, goods, and services were available for the white population. Y ou started to see white kids back behind the 
counters of fast food restaurants and white men on construction sites, on road crews and working in warehouses, not to mention 
back in the cannery and what was left of the logging industry. When we were through, white men who had once believed they 
would never work again in their lives were bringing home paychecks and holding up their heads, and they all knew damned well 
who they had to thank. I had started the ball rolling with my call to that assistant manager at Fulton&apos; s Market Now we had to 
reverse a whole large-scale demographic process that had been ongoing for half a century. With a little guts, it took us about three 
months to make Lewis County all white again. 

The county&apos;s few blacks and Jews had already gotten the message by this time, and there were hardly any left In fact if memory 
serves I don&apos;t think we ever had to whack a single Jew in Lewis. The few who lived there before 10/22 had the usual sensitive 
antennae of their people, they picked up on the ancient vibes of the pogrom fast and they got the hell out That s one of the things 
that always ticks me off, when ZOG propaganda to this day moans and groans about the Northwest Holocaust where the NVA 
was supposedly shoving kikes into ovens and making them into lampshades and soap and burying them in mass graves and that 
kind of horse hockey. (Okay, granted, there was 0. C. Oglevy and his beer mug made from the skull of a rabbi, but Oglevy was 
nuts.) We simply didn&apos;t catch that many Jews. Once they realized that their shabazz-goy government couldn&apos;t protect them, the 
Jews ran like bunnies out of the Northwest Why do you think the WPB had to track down the doctor who murdered my father in 
Philadelphia years later? We didn&apos;t even have to kill that many Mexicans. Again I should point out that people from more 
primitive Third World cultures never had any difficulty at all in understanding the situation. Where they came from they were 
used to being pushed around by gun-toters, in uniform and out To them race war was an obvious concept one they had been 
consciously waging against us at a low level for years. It was only the dumb-ass whites who couldn&apos; t seem to wrap their minds 
around it The spies themselves had long been demanding their own nation in the Southwest called A ztlan, so the Mex and the 
NVA understood one another. In an odd way, we both got what we wanted, since many of the Mexicans we ran out of the 
Northwest ended up back in California or Arizona or Texas, carried their grudge against the white man with them, and were 
instrumental in founding A ztlan. 

We made up some flyers in Spanish, very grim and official sounding, citing General Order Number Four and ordering them all out 
of the Homeland. We scattered them around in areas where we knew the spies would find them and get the word out on the 
grapevine. The local white liberals organized a few loud macho chest beating publicity stunts where the spies marched down the 
street in Dundee and Centralia waving signs to the effect of Hell No, We Won&apos;t Go, Diversity Si, Racism No, all that kind of 
garbage. Needless to say, the media fell down on their knees and adored. We waited until they had folded up their cameras and 
turned off their klieg lights, and then we went to work. It was time for the old Molotov cocktail trick. We had a dandy recipe, half 
liquid detergent and maybe a third gasoline with the bottle topped up by motor oil. It turned into a kind of napalm, stuck to 
whatever it hit and burned nice and hot In the wee hours of the morning, one of our crews would stage some kind of diversion in 
or near a wealthy suburb, throw a pipe bomb or riddle some rich man&apos; s house with bullets to make sure the cops would all rush to 

A Distant Thunder 93 



the scene with their yellow tape and their investigators and their forensic units. While they were tied up, a few miles away we 
were burning out Mexicans. 

We started on their economic base, the small businesses the illegals owned and patronized and which provided the goods and 
services necessary to maintain their unlawful presence in our country. Hispanic and A sian speciality stores, bodegas, hot food 
takeaways, labor contracting offices both official and unofficial, welfare and social services offices and anywhere else they got a 
government check, little storefront Pentecostal churches run by brain- dead J udaeo- Christians who sheltered and fed them, every 
motel in the county run by someone named Patel (which was just about all of them,) the little hole in the wall check-cashing and 
wire service places that sent money that should have been going into our people&apos; s pockets down to Mexico and points south. Two 
Volunteers tossing cocktails and two drivers ready, and a fifth Volunteer on guard with something heavy to prevent interference. 
That&apos; s when I made those Mexicans do the hat dance with the Thompson .45 one golden evening. Some of us wanted to torch 
certain houses and apartment buildings that had turned into barrios, but Tank vetoed it &quot;That&apos; s all we need, to toast a bunch of 
cute little brown bambinos! &quot; he snorted derisively. &quot;That would play just great on the six o&apos; clock news! It&apos; s not necessary 
anyway. If you want to make a species extinct you don&apos; t have to hunt them all down and kill them one by one. Y ou destroy their 
habitat.&quot; So we did. Within a few weeks there was not a bottle of Mexican soda pop or a Spanish- language porno video available 
anywhere in Lewis County. These places we hit were mostly empty buildings at night, and no one was seriously hurt, but we had 
made a serious start in cutting off the non-whites&apos; support system. 

Then we moved up the food chain (no pun intended) and went after the convenience marts, and that got a bit rougher. In Lewis 
County these were mostly run by Koreans, who were tougher nuts to crack than the other wogs. They owned guns and could use 
them, and to give them their due, A sians would make a fight of it where blacks and J ews and M exicans would run. V olunteer 
Ralph Donati was killed in the act of taking out a Korean- run mini- mart, our first casualty in E Company after the man who died 
in Coeur d&apos; Alene during the Sixteen Days. Our technique here was to wait until the store was empty of customers if we could, 
bust through the door in force and waste any non- whites on the premises before they could reach below the counter for their own 
guns, chase out any customers, toss a grenade in the back room to take care of anyone skulking there, then dump some of our 
special incendiary goo on the merchandise and the fixtures and toss a cocktail as we left. Depending on whether or not there were 
any white residential structures nearby, we might or might not drop a grenade down into the gasoline tank below the pumps and 
make a big boom and a nice big lovely fireball in the sky. We not only wasted the gooks and wogs running the store but made sure 
that there was nothing left for Uncle Pak or Cousin Sanjay to re-open. We didn&apos;t get them all to divest, but within a few weeks 
there were white faces behind all those counters and the brown and yellow ones were off to California or the east coast or 
somewhere more salubrious to their health. We learned that it wasn&apos;t even so much the killings and burnings that prompted the 
departure of the A sians, it was the fact that the head offices of their various franchises found they could no longer get insurance at 
any price. That was how the Iraqi guerrillas had shut down the Basra tanker port; no one would insure the tankers against their 
repeated attacks. 

Then there were the legendary Northwest snipers. 

Snipers were a major tactical weapon of the NVA, and possibly our most effective when it came to enforcing General Order 
Number Four and clearing the Homeland of its unlawful non-white population. Not to mention General Order Number Five, 
which sentenced race- mixers to death. No one of any color wants to live in a country where you might be shot down on the street 
at any moment. And if our sniping provoked random retaliation by black and Mexican snipers against white people who were 
trying to get on with their lives? Well, got a hot flash for you, sunshine. There are no neutrals in a race war. Y our skin is your 
uniform. So get your damned ass off the fence and join the NVA and fight for your race and defeat these people who are your 
enemies and who should not be here at all. The grand and glorious United Statesof America cannot protect you worth a bucket of 
warm spit, but we can help you protect yourself and your family if you will just stand up and be a man. Got it? 
I have read books and seen televids wherein the snipers were credited with winning the whole War of Independence for us. Well, I 
wouldn&apos; t go quite that far, but they sure as hell sent a vital message, and that was that until this business was settled and the white 
man got back a piece of his own pie, there would be no normal life, no business as usual, not for anyone. And by God, there 
wasn&apos;t. Once again, we were astounded by what we could accomplish through a little guts, the simple physical courage necessary 
to fight for our country even if it put us in danger. We very quickly discovered that we were able to more or less shut down normal 
life at will, for everyone in some pretty large swaths of territory. American society was so complex, everything so interactive and 
interlocking and interdependent on everything else, that when you cut the chain at one point the whole works just ground to a halt. 
I began to understand why ZOG had been so paranoid about us all those years. They always knew how vulnerable they were if we 
ever rediscovered our courage, even if we didn&apos;t. 

Sniper teams operated in pairs, one shooting and one driving. It was one of the few times we would only use one vehicle by 
choice. Less conspicuous. Each team had its own modus operandi, from vans with gunports concealed in the paneling to 
motorcycle strikes. Some of our most renowned sharpshooters like the legendary Johnny Johnson, Shorty Tyler and Jenny 
Seawright the Black Widow, would pick their targets carefully and stalk them for days, a single head shot bringing down 
politicians and military officers, corporate executives and reporters, lawyers and prison officers who beat and tortured our people. 
Others like Kid Coyle and Dangerous Dan McGrew (I think his real name was Witherspoon or something innocuous hke that) 
would simply do the easy rider number and cruise the Northwest on hot wheels, taking a shot wherever one came up, and they 
made some surprisingly lucky bags. There were speciality snipers. Conrad Baumgarten came all the way from Germany with his 
SS officer grandfatheri s scoped &apos; 98 Mauser to hunt J ews. Interracial couples vanished from the streets of the Homeland in a 

A Distant Thunder 94 



matter of months after 10/22; any white slut who dared show her face in public with her beast of pleasure had to be suicidal. The 
Northwest is a very large place, and with even minimal escape and evasion skills it was fairly easy for the snipers to take a shot, 
drop the target, then un-ass the area even before anybody dialed 911, and then strike again fifty miles away a few hours later. Two 
or three teams could effectively paralyze a city like, say, Tacoma. Once it became apparent that the United States no longer 
enjoyed a credible monopoly of armed force, then before too long GHQ was being quietly approached by municipal governments 
who were willing to bring themselves into compliance with certain Party policies in order to make sure their cities were sniper- 
free. Affirmative action programs in city employment and contracting disappeared. Black and brown faces in city government 
were seen no longer. Human relations councils and other enforcers of political correctness found their budgets were gone with the 
wind and their jobs redundant. Y ou get the idea. 

But the main effectiveness of the sniper offensive lay in the whitening of the Homeland. We demonstrated that in Lewis County. It 
became apparent to the public very early on that for all their swaggering, threatening, chest- beating and arrogant, belligerent red, 
white and blue rhetoric, ZOG simply could not protect the average Juan or Rastus on the street from getting a .30-06 bullet in his 
skull. The Northwest got real white, real fast. This is what always amuses me about these wild accusations I hear even to this day 
about how we allegedly slaughtered all these niggers and spies and gooks during the Cleanup. It&apos; s the same as with the alleged 
Northwest Holocaust of all those Jews we never managed to get hold of. The non-whites were pretty much all gone by the time of 
the Cleanup and it was the white traitors who got theirs during that period. Third World immigrants were in America not because 
they wanted to be Amurricans and enjoy all the wonderful benefits of living in a land of freedom and democracy and all that 
asinine horse hockey. Non-whites came to America for one reason only, to take what the white man had. Hell, look at it from their 
point of view. W hy shouldn&apos; t they come into our country and take what we had? For three generations we never lifted a finger to 
fight for it. They held us in contempt, and we damned well deserved it. What kind of people won&apos;t fight to repel foreign invaders? 
Their motivations were purely economic and once those motivations were rendered nugatory or too risky for them to remain in the 
Northwest, then the Third Worlders moved on to other parts of North America where they could still get what they came for, 
which was all that lovely green money. 

After the NVA in Lewis County leveled or cleaned out the mercantile level of the mudflow, then we attacked the root cause of the 
whole problem. We went after the employers. 

By then the vibe was sinking in among the country club set throughout Lewis County: there were some bad new boys on the 
block, ZOG couldn&apos;t protect the wealthy and a six- figure checking account wouldn&apos;t stop a bullet From there it was a short step 
to the conclusion that hiring Third World labor was no longer a viable option for the canny entrepeneur. It was Fulton Market writ 
large. Hey, you hit the suits&apos; money and they catch on fast, fast, fast! It only took one furniture assembly factory in Chehalis to go 
up in smoke and a couple of calls from Tank Thompson to our local captains of industry before every businessman in the county 
was picking up the phone, calling their temp agencies, and telling them to pay off the wetbacks at the end of the week and replace 
their labor force with workers of proper legal documentation, starting on Monday morning. The agencies picked up on the coded 
words and leaped to do their money- masters&apos; bidding. Thirty years of trumpeted &apos;diversity&apos; died in one weekend. One Sunday in 
September the Lewis and Thurston County newspapers were unusually thick. No one admitted outright what was happening, but 
when we opened the classifieds, we found something that no one had seen in almost a generation in the Northwest— page after 
page of glorious, wonderful jobs advertised, in big block type. We never reahzed just how much of the Northwest&apos; s lifeblood the 
illegals were draining, until all of a sudden they were gone. The jobs still paid peanuts, but at least they were there, and eventually 
white people could start moving back into homes and got out from living under the railway bridges and in the homeless shelters. 
For the first time in the memory of anyone under forty, the Mexicans and the Asians and the Middle Eastern who-knows-whats 
were gone. Lewis County was white again. Y ep. It was that easy. All that was necessary was a few white men who had the 
courage to stand erect. We understood, with a mixture of pride and humiliation, that we could have done it at any time during the 
past thirty years. All it took was a relatively modest amount of simple physical courage, and at the eleventh hour and the fifty- 
ninth minute and the last damned second, through some miracle of God, we found it 

Then we were able to go after the real enemy, the enemy who had always been the mainstay of tyranny and the oppressor of our 
people. The enemy who had to be crushed into powder if there was ever again to be freedom in this land— the loyalists. The 
whites who supported the United States government out of ignorance or arrogance or misguided religion, or self-interest or greed, 
or force of habit or just plain stupidity. In any revolution, that is the enemy the rebels must defeat decisively and totally. The 
enemy within. 

This required a lot more finesse. Tank was not one of these wild-eyes like Oglevy and certain others whose philosophy it was to 
simply shoot down anyone they didn&apos;t like. &quot;We have to hurt people because we have to assert our authority,&quot; the lieutenant told 
us. &quot;All authority and law is based on armed force. We have to be obeyed. We have to inspire fear so that people won&apos;t co-operate 
with Z G , won&apos; t turn us in, won&apos; t give the enemy information, and so on the other hand they will give us the practical and logistic 
help we need, and so on. Butyou can&apos;t found a new nation on fear alone. We&apos;re going to have to make the people of the 
Northwest want the Republic because they understand its their best possible future, and so the bloodletting needs to be carefully 
controlled. We mustn&apos;t kill anyone when a kneecapping will do, and we mustn&apos; t kneecap when a quick going-over with the brass 
knucks will do. We want people to be just enough afraid so that they don&apos;t call the Feds on us, but not so completely terrified that 
they do, if you get the distinction. We want them to think of us as mean violent bastards, not crazy murdering bastards. It s a hard 
call to make.&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 95 



It was vitally necessary to the whole thrust of the revolution that we not only gain support among white Northwesters in fact and 
in practice, but that this support should be perceived. The public fagade of consent of the governed had to be brought crashing 
down and the world made to understand that we were not just a gang of terrorists but a legitimate armed force for a new nation 
demanding freedom. This meant that any public white criticism against the NVA or the revolution, any public support of the old 
order, could not be allowed. Our claim to represent the white people of the Homeland must be clear and unchallenged, because 
eventually we were going to have to sit down at the conference table with the occupying power and our demand for our people&apos; s 
Homeland had to have that legitimacy behind it. ZOG understood this as well, and during the early days of the war they ran all 
kinds of agitprop to the effect that most white Northwesters were good loyal Amurricans and we were only a tiny gang of 
terrorists with no popular backing, etc. etc. If we were ever to gain international recognition as a bona fide national and racial 
liberation movement and accorded the right to speak at the settlement table, that crap had to end, and fast. 
The government and their various private support groups counterattacked on the propaganda front. Initially they tried staging so- 
called Marches Against Terrorism, Rallies for The American Way, Rainbow Rallies, and such-hke big media extravaganzas with 
acres of red, white and blue waving. There would be a coalition of politicians and so-called community leaders from all the 
minority groups denouncing the NVA and hugging each other on the platform. In one case they even lead in a sing-song of 
Michael, Row the Boat Ashore as well as the usual America the Beautiful. It was suggested by some of our more vigorous 
comrades, myself among them, that we creep up on one of these little three- minute hates and stage a firepower demonstration. 
&quot;This business of a bunch of white assholes with shit for brains marching in the streets waving red, white, and blue and shouting 
stupid liberal crap about racism has just naturally got to stop,&quot; I said in irritation. &quot;Why not just hose down the whole crowd and 
see if they can River Dance?&quot; 

Tank vetoed that. &quot; Our comrades in Idaho have done that once,&quot; he said dryly, referring to Oglevy&apos; s crew and the so-called 
Sandpoint Massacre, which the media were still shrieking about months later. &quot;That has made the point sufficiently, I think, that 
we can do such things if we choose. I&apos;d like to try the scalpel rather than the axe in Lewis County, boys. We need to identify the 
people behind this kind of anti-white activity and reason with them. I agree, there must be no more of this assisting the Zionist 
Occupation G ovemment in their propaganda against the Republic. No more red, white and blue Masonic dishrags on people&apos; s 
front porches, no more pro-government bumper stickers on cars and trucks. Shane, could you and Captain Morehouse between 
you provide us with a list of the fifty or so top loyal Amurricans in Lewis County, the ones you deem most in need of an attitude 
adjustment? They are our wayward brothers and sisters and they must be admonished to mend their ways, but wherever possible 
r d like to chastise them more in sadness than in anger, rather than cut off their heads. Remember the lines from Henry the Fifth: 
&apos;When lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.&apos;&quot; Tank was a Shakespeare aficionado 
like myself, another thing I always liked about him. &quot;A Iso, next supply run could you pick us up a couple of spools of fishing line? 
I think Commandant Oglevy goes over the top sometimes, but I do like that idea he came up with about sewing informers&apos; lips 
together to stop them from flapping. There&apos; s something positively elegant there. It makes an eloquent statement and yet it&apos; s non- 
fatal.&quot; That was the difference between a CO like Tank and one like Oglevy. We sewed up a few lips and gave the tattletales a 
good scolding with blunt instruments, the word got around, and all of a sudden the FBI couldn&apos;t get so much as a whisper out of 
Lewis County. Oglevy did the same thing to informers, but then he shot them. Why bother to sew if you&apos; re just going to kill the 
rat anyway? Okay, yeah, we did both lip-sew and nailold Walter&apos;s A murrican flag hard hat to his head that one time. But the man 
ratted out a Wingfield. He pissed me off. 

A ny way, given Tank&apos; s policy of being the gentlest gamester, the result was that a lot of our tickles were thumpings, or sometimes 
we called them attitude adjustments, i.e. disciplinary beatings that were meant to send a message. A lot of the wavers of red, white 
and blue were just following lifelong habits of conformity and honest to G od didn&apos; t know any better, or else they were practical 
people, opportunists with an eye to the main chance who could appreciate a practical demonstration of the fact that the United 
States government no longer had a credible monopoly of armed force, modify their behavior accordingly, and be seen to modify it. 
Them we corrected gentle and artistic with the caress of baseball bat on carcass. It wasn&apos;t simply whaling the tar out of someone 
at random to spread terror. I agree now, with the benefit of hindsight, that despite the heedless exuberance of my youth 
indiscriminate terror is about as useful as a prairie fire, causing nothing but mindless destruction. Everything that the NVA did 
served a purpose, specifically the independence of the Northwest as sovereign A ryan nation. Y ou didn&apos; t just beat the crap out of 
somebody for the sake of beating him. A thumping was intended not only to explain the new paradigm to the misguided soul in 
terms he could not possibly fail to understand, but to make a political statement, a statement that had to be heard and understood 
by the community as a whole. First, we made it obvious that we could have killed him but we didn&apos;t, and so we weren&apos;t such bad 
guys after all. The NVA believed in rehabilitation, up to a point. Second, everyone in the Homeland had to know that the Party 
was in charge now, and ZOG wasn&apos;t, and that there were certain kinds of behavior that we would not tolerate, like white assholes 
with shit for brains and A murrican flags running their mouths loud and disrespectful against the Party and the NVA in public. 
There was a definite art to thumpings. The whole thing took about thirty seconds, and then we were done and outta there. If it 
lasted longer than that, then we&apos; d screwed up somewhere. There was a definite procedure to be followed. Y ou needed two cars 
and four men, two batters, and two driver/gunners for backup. Y ou clocked your target for several days beforehand, watched his 
home and hisjob and everything he did. This was usually done by a separate surveillance team who didn&apos;t carry out the actual 
corrective discipline, and I came to sympathize with cops who have to spend long, boring hours on stakeouts, although sometimes 
I got to go on these gigs with Rooney, and any time I could snatch with her was always a plus. Once you had the target&apos; s schedule 
quantified you tried to take him down in a secluded place (obviously) but one where he couldn&apos;t get his back to the wall. Home 

A Distant Thunder 96 



invasions were allowed, but you had to make sure the guy&apos;s living room had enough space for your thumpers to swing their bats, 
or else drag him out in the back yard. Myself, I didn&apos; t like home invasions because sometimes you had to kill the guy&apos; s dog or 
dogs, and to me that was way out of line. The dogs never did anything against the Republic and they didn&apos; t deserve to die just for 
defending the person they were supposed to defend. 

The two drivers kept the engines running and got out, doors open, with weapons at the ready to prevent any interference. The two 
thumpers also de- bussed with their baseball bats or lead pipes or steel rebar or whatever was to be used to chastise the errant 
individual. Each thumper struck eight blows, so the target ideally received sixteen carefully placed whacks, no more and no less, 
although of course it real life it didn&apos;t always work out that way. There was no conversation. The target was assumed to know 
what all this was about. One thumper went for the target head on, in order to distract his attention from the second member of the 
team who would do the real damage. The target usually threw his arms up in a panic and attempted to engage in conversation, 
which was ignored. The front thumper&apos; s first two blows broke the target&apos; s arms, after which point he went for the knees, the 
ankles, one to the left collarbone and the left jaw. In the meantime the rear thumper came in from behind with two in the kidneys, 
one right-hand and one back hand, to make the target piss like Leon Sorels made me piss when he beat me with his nightstick in 
the guidance counselor&apos; s office. Then two more to the lower part of the ribcage to break the lowest rib on either side, one to the 
right collarbone and one to the right jaw, and two to the hips. No upper head shots. No groin; we wanted the word to get out that 
we were chivalrous in that respect. Once our friend had received his sixteen licks and was in a suitably dismantled condition, we 
jumped in our cars and took off leaving him a broken mess on the ground to contemplate the error of his ways. We never had to 
come back again and repeat the lesson. After he got out of the hospital the target either left the county or else he cleaned up his act 
and took down the Masonic dishrag from his porch. We never ever actually stole or ripped down Amurrican flags in those sitches. 
It was vitally important from a psychological standpoint that the person concerned or his family take it down themselves. 
The media were a different kettle of fish. There we had to be a bit more bloody. 

Control of the newspapers and television, and control of the Hollywood dream machine itself, was arguably the most powerful 
weapon in ZOG&apos;s arsenal, and we had to strip them of it. This was difficult, because few centers of media activity were located in 
the Pacific Northwest There was little point in our forcing the Seattle Post-Intelligencer to an agreement to provide balanced 
coverage of the war if we could not enforce the same balance on the New Y ork Times, if you see what I mean. There was some 
dispute in the Army Council and the Political Bureau over how we were to handle the media problem. Some wanted to simply 
write them all off, declare all news media to be legitimate military targets and shoot reporters and TV crews on sight just as 
quickly as we would an FBI agent. I must admit I always rather favored this idea myself. Reporters were reptiles who fed on the 
blood of human misery. They were almost without exception either Jews or ideological liberals and leftists. Their subservience to 
ZOG had been legendary for three generations, and they were the establishment&apos;s strongest prop. Why not just simply cut down 
the whole rotten tree rather than attempt to prune it? 

But once again other and more compassionate counsels prevailed, or perhaps more subtle counsels. The NVA adopted a policy of 
holding individual reporters personally responsible for especially egregious coverage, no excuses accepted about no no don&apos; t hurt 
me it wasn&apos; t my fault my editor did it. Reporters who knew that their finished product might well come back to bite them got real 
careful about what they wrote and said on the air, and that cut down the raw material liberal editors and managers had to work 
with from the start when they were trying to shape and mold public opinion against us. GHQ actually drew up a kind of code of 
conduct and a style manual for both print and electronic media reporters covering the conflict in the Northwest, and we made sure 
all media people got a copy e-mailed or snail- mailed to them, which I understand unnerved them in itself. It was pretty simple. 
Reporters and media were to tell only the truth about us, and were not to manipulate words or images to imply untruth, which was 
always the basis of all left-wing propaganda. The liberal media very seldom outright lied, because they understood that they had to 
maintain a certain basic credibility in order to carry out their mission of mind control. They were just very selective about what 
they reported and how they reported it. Restrict the mediate the FourWs they used to teach in journalism school. Who What 
When and Where, and forbid them to play games with weasel words and sound bytes, and their teeth were pulled. If we planted a 
bomb or killed someone, then fair enough, that&apos;s news. They were to write up their story or go on the air saying &quot;The Northwest 
Volunteer Army did this, did it there, did it at such and such a time, etc.&quot; 

We also emphasized that in their reportage, we expected balance. We understood that they more or less had to quote and cover 
official government statements and press releases and that a large part of their content was going to be ZOG propaganda. But the 
media and their spokesmen were also made to understand that we required them to report why the NVA had done whatever we&apos; d 
done, and the substance of all NVA press releases or statements on the subject were to be quoted verbatim in time and proportion 
equal to government press releases, or else we might call upon them at some inconvenient time to express our concerns. Personal 
opinions were to be confined to the editorial page where they belonged, and not disguised as news or features. Coverage of the 
war was to be straightforward and factual. There were to be no soppy features or so-called human interest stories whining about 
the wicked NVA and oh these evil racists done killed such and such a wonderful hooman bean blah blah, no attempts to incite or 
inflame or paint us as some kind of devils from hell while our opponents were plaster saints. Government propaganda was to be 
subjected to critical, factual examination. In short, they were to report the news, not take sides. 

A tall order indeed for an industry whose whole raison d&apos;etre waste side with ZOG. Some of them didn&apos;t have sense enough to 
take us seriously, at least not at first, and some of them we knew were beyond reasonable approach anyway. The publisher of the 
Dundee Advertiser at that time was a J udaeo- Christian religious rightist named Don Wagram, whose editorial policy was simple: 
Islam was a false religion and Muslims must be converted at gunpoint if need be, Israel was the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, 

A Distant Thunder 97 



Amumca was the greatest country in the world and never wrong, and George W. Bush had been on a first name basis with God. 
We didn&apos;t bother to thump him, but simply charged into the newspaper building, kicked in the door to his office, and shot him 
down as he screamed in terror and tried to climb out the window. That was the first kill I ever made with that beautiful Webley 
revolver Carter gave me; when Wagram was half in and half out of the window I administered a .455-caliber enema before I 
dragged him back inside and gave him two more in the head. 

That was really all the example the local print reporters needed, and they henceforth were quite restrained. The television news 
crews were somewhat harder to reach, since they had less basis in the community, and the big- name ones from the major cable 
and broadcast networks came into the Northwest from elsewhere and were always well guarded by Feebs or private security goons 
when they were here. In Tacoma, Mike Koltsov&apos; s Don Cossacks wiped out one hotshot media celebrity from Fox News with a 
LAWS rocket Lurch shot down a news helicopter, and eventually my crew from Dundee and Bob Corrigan&apos; s boys from Lacey 
staged an elaborate snatch up in Olympia. We kneecapped the cameraman and the news van driver from a Seattle station, trussed 
up the female reporter in the Barbie doll suit and took her for a ride in the country. J eannie Vandenberg, I think her name was. Or 
Vanderberg, something like that. In a suitably pastoral setting, we tied her into a chair and systematically drove her out of her 
mind with terror for about a day. WeletAjax play Russianroulette with her. We staged a phoney hanging where we dropped her 
but didn&apos;t tie off the rope at the other end so she fell into horse shit. Rooney did a great psycho bitch act and showed her a gas can 
and told her we were going to bum her alive for telling lies, that kind of thing. To crown it all we brought in Smackwater Jack, 
and we held her down while he pulled down her panties and tattooed &quot;NV A Slut&quot; on her butt Then we took her back gibbering to 
Olympia and kicked her loose with a note to her station manager that we found a distinct lack of balance in their coverage of the 
revolt, and we strongly suggested they re-evaluate their guidelines. This and similar incidents elsewhere around the Northwest 
certainly were responsible for a much more balanced approach by the media on the ground, although those who weren&apos;t in the 
Northwest itself continued to smear us right, left, and center and howl for our blood. Third Section operatives were able to slip 
into New Y ork and Hollywood and Atlanta and D.C. and take out some of the worst offenders, and by the end of the war the 

media had more or less been neutralized as a Zionist weapon.

I suppose now is as good a time as any to address the standard liberal accusation leveled against the NVA, at the time and ever 
since, that we were wicked and horrible and evil and just plain not nice people. 

W ell, we weren&apos; t Y ou know what they say about nice guys. They finish last, and for the sake of an entire race of mankind, 
finishing last simply wasn&apos;t an option. All right, what we did to that newshen J eannie from Seattle was mean and cruel, and I&apos;m 
not proud of it. I wasn&apos;t proud of it then. But what we did with her was better than really murdering the silly bimbo like some of 
our comrade crews would have done. Once again, the word got around, and that terrified woman recounting her ordeal to her 
colleagues did more for our goals than finding her dead body swinging from a railroad trestle would have done. I repeat to you: 
terrorism is the weapon of the weak against the strong, and the weak need never apologize for using it if the strong won&apos; t quit 
bullying and harming and tyrannizing them. Bobby Fernandez was about twice my size and I damned sure needed that concrete 
block I hit him with. 

There was a vital principle at stake that we had to enforce as a matter of life and death. Collaboration with the United States 
government was not allowed. Period. End of story. If our own people were more afraid of ZOG than they were of us, we were all 
dead. So we had to make them more afraid of us and worry about hearts and minds as a secondary consideration, although for a lot 
of officers like Tank it was an important consideration. There were strong precedents for this. We now know, for example, that the 
entire Iraqi resistance plan was organized by Saddam Hussein many years before the 2003 invasion, and it concentrated above all 
on attacking and neutrnlizing those Iraqis who collaborated with the invading American forces. The Iraqi resistance could actually 
have killed a lot more A merican invaders than it did, but the object was not to kill American soldiers per se, it was to liberate Iraq 
from the tyranny of Zion, and the Arabs recognized something it took white Americans almost a century to understand, that it is 
the collaborator of your own kind who is the most deadly threat to the liberty of a nation or the survival of a race. 
Red Morehouse was something of an aficionado of Movement history, and on more than one occasion he told us about all the 
long, pointless, wasted years during the late twentieth century, when anyone who even so much as whispered about taking direct 
action against the tyranny that was wiping our race from the face of the earth was shouted down, accused of being a ZOG 
operative, and viciously smeared on the internet by cyber- nuts, many of whom later turned out to be government agents 
themselves. The Old Man himself was an outcast for years because he openly advocated that our people collectively commit an 
actual physical act. Northwest Migration, instead of just continuing to generate endless empty words on a computer screen. I 
remember a discussion we had about that in Chowder Society once, back when I was in high school. &quot;Mr. Morehouse, I just don&apos;t 
get it,&quot; Rooney had said, shaking her head. &quot;From what you describe it looks like we hardly did a nything except spin our wheels 
from about 1950 until the Old Man Came Home in 2002.&quot; 

&quot;Actually, we didn&apos;t do much except spin our wheels for some time after that,&quot; responded Red with an embittered chuckle. 
&quot;But why? &quot; demanded Roon in angry exasperation. &quot; W hat in G od&apos; s name were those people in the M ovement thinking all those 
years while they frittered away the last chances we had to take back all of A merica? How did they expect to save our race and our 
civilization by doing nothing except mailing each other newspaper clippings and posting articles on the internet whining about 
how bad things were? What did they think was going to happen? Flying saucers were going to land on the White House lawn and 
overthrow ZOG?&quot; 

A Distant Thunder 98 



&quot;Rooney, a lot of people in our movement have given considerable thought to that very subject,&quot; Morehouse told us. &quot;To begin 
with, the disgraceful fact is that there were a number of bogus white leaders who were making a good living off selling racial 
snake oil and were absolutely terrified when the Old Man rocked the boat They savaged him hke junkyard dogs. But it goes a lot 
deeper than that, into the white American character itself. I am not sure anyone will ever be able to explain just what happened to 
any significant white opposition in the last half of the last century. M ay be it&apos; s because the A ryan gene pool had been so terribly 
thinned and damaged by the two fratricidal wars we fought against our brothers in Europe, who the hell knows? But somewhere 
along the line, the white man&apos;s spine turned into a wet noodle. We seem to have acquired the idea that fighting back against this 
terrible government and the evil people who run it was something that someone else was going to have to do. We just seem to 
have given up. Fighting back against ZOG simply became too— inconvenient, as grotesque as that sounds. Somehow we got the 
ludicrous notion that there can be such a thing as risk- free revolution, that justice and liberty is a free lunch. Somehow we seem to 
have become convinced that we could find some way of preserving the existence of our race and our civilization without causing 
any harm or inconvenience to the people who are killing us. The cosmic scales have to be balanced. How can there ever be justice 
and freedom without the punishment of those who have done evil? I don&apos;t know. How could we possibly be so foolish as to think 
that there is some way to solve all this which involves no risk, not even any real inconvenience, to ourselves? We were lazy, 
cowardly, apathetic, pusillanimous, stupid beyond beUef . It&apos; s incomprehensible. I can only pray that we have awakened to the 
terrible reality of our situation in time.&quot; 

I have mentioned before that we were stronger in soul than the Americans. This means that conversely, the Americans were 
weaker. Asa nation, Americans had long since forgotten one of the basic rules of human history which older and more 
experienced peoples knew instinctively: what goes around, comes around. Bullies eventually get their comeuppance, even if only 
from another, tougher bully. A mericans had been dishing it out for so long that they simply couldn&apos; t take it when their turn came 
to be on the receiving end. Nothing in the American experience prepared people like that newshen for physical confrontation with 
deadly enemies who were quite capable of killing her, or readied them psychologically to be on the receiving end of violence. 
Resistance to violent assault was bred out of the white man, lest he rebel against his masters in Washington, D. C. When one was 
victimized by crime one was never, ever supposed to fight, lest one accidentally end up harming someone with a colored skin and 
be charged with hatecrime. One picked up the phone and called the police, and once the police were no longer able to protect 
themselves much less John Q. Public, John Q. was screwed and he knew it. 

Once white people gave up their guns under the Schumer A ct they could only run and hide in various ways from the non- white 
street crime. Hell, in most states under ZOG it was actually illegal to spank your children. A whole generation of white Americans 
grew up never having received a physical blow in their life and usually all it took was to punch them or slap them hard and they 
broke down blubbering. I remember reading somewhere that when the Iraqis actually started fighting back after America invaded 
them to steal their oil in &apos;03, the army had to ship over teams of &quot;combat stress specialists,&quot; psychologists and shrinks whose duty 
it was to &quot;grief- counsel&quot; U. S. soldiers who had lost people in their unit and hold their hands because those bad native chappies 
were shooting at them and being mean to them. They also had the job of trying to keep these mighty warriors for liberty and 
democracy and the American way from having nervous breakdowns and shooting themselves because they were so depressed to 
be stuck in the desert away from the nearest Burger Doodle. Christ, can you imagine the soldiers of General Patton or the Marines 
at the Frozen Chosen needing grief counselors because the big bad enemy kept shooting at them? 

The fact is that ZOG had just spent almost three generations deliberately breeding and socially engineering every last chromosome 
of aggressiveness, courage, and moral strength they could out of the white man so we would put up with multi-culturalism, 
massive Third World immigration, perversion and oppression without rebelling, and they damned near succeeded in turning an 
entire race into Casper Milquetoasts. When through some miracle a small band of us recovered a few hairs on our testicles and 
found within ourselves the guts to raise our hands against the tyrant, that worked in our favor. White Americans simply were no 
longer the men and women their pioneer ancestors had been. In the movies John Wayne and Rambo and other strong-jawed 
caricatures swaggered on for Amurrica, but out in the real world hfe was simply too sweet and the American people were as soft 
as butter. I mean, Jesus, back in &apos;01 nineteen Arab kids with box cutters who crashed four planes into the ground scared the whole 
empire so witless they caused a depression that never really went away, by frightening the herds of consumer animals away from 
the shopping malls. When confronted with people who were wilhng to use violence if necessary in order to get our way, your 
average white Amurrican crumpled and bawled for his mama and begged for mercy. Y ou can have no idea what cowards they 
were. When all of a sudden through some mysterious process that eagle gene suddenly re- appears amongst a flock of chickens, the 

eagle rules the roost

W ar requires not just blood but also gold to feed upon, and we needed to make sure the enemy&apos; s supply was cut back even as we 
helped ourselves to his own wealth at gunpoint I&apos;ve already quoted Red Morehouse about the accountants and not the generals 
surrendering until I&apos; m sure you&apos; re sick of hearing it ma&apos; am, but I cannot emphasize enough that our main strategic goal was to hit 
ZOG and ZOG &apos; s supporters where it counts, in their wallets. We needed to take money in ourselves so that we would have its 
power at our disposal, and we needed stop the Federal government of the United States from taking it in so as to lessen the amount 
of money power at their disposal. This wasn&apos;t as hard as it sounds, in view of the way the United States was spread so thin all 
around the world and still trying to keep the Middle East from exploding and keep Israel on the map. I once read somewhere that 
even at the height of the War of Independence there were still more American troops overseas that there were soldiers. Fatties and 
cops in the Northwest and the Middle Eastern oil empire consumed ten times as much in the way of money and resources as did 

A Distant Thunder 99 



the Northwest war at its hottest. Odd as it may sound, to ZOG we were just a sideshow. The desperate struggle for Israel&apos; s 
continued existence was where it was at for the government. Out of their pockets and into ours, that&apos; s the way it had to go in order 
to make revolution. The Army Council very early on issued a decree that henceforth ZOG did not get a single penny in tax out of 
the Northwest. It was one of the smartest things we ever did. 

One of our major strategic priorities was that every NVA active service unit had to implement attacks on the Internal Revenue 
Service and their tax collection mechanism and shut it down, choke off the flow of funds to La Cesspool Grande in D. C. From the 
very beginning the IRS itself, its agents and offices and plant and anything to do with it was considered to be a prime target for 
attack. IRS agents were considered to be irredeemable, like lawyers (actually many of them were lawyers) and so they were not 
beaten, they were warned once to leave the Northwest and then they were shot if they stayed. The only reason they were warned 
even once was because there were simply too many of them for us to shoot them all, and if we shot two in a particular IRS office 
and then warned the other ten, at least eight of the other ten would cut out for safer pastures and we would accomplish the Party&apos; s 
objective just effectively as if we had killed them. In either case, an IRS who is absent from his desk in the Pacific Northwest can 
hardly be collecting taxes in the Pacific Northwest, can he? It didn&apos;t matter whether he was dead or alive, so long as he was not 
sitting at his desk stealing from our people. 

True, we more or less bombed and shot every Internal Revenue Service agent and employee out of the Northwest, but violence 
against individual tax droids was secondary. The main tax collection mechanism for the Federal government was the employee 
payroll withholding system, so we rousted a lot of bookkeepers. Those were simple tickles that very seldom broke bad. Rooney 
and I got it down to where we could do five or six of them per day. We would stroll into a plant or an office or a store, well 
dressed and with no weapons showing, but with backup on call if it got hot, and we would politely ask for an appointment with the 
person in charge of payroll from employees who thought we were looking for a job or selling something. We&apos; d sit down and 
explain to the lady over a cup of coffee that we had friends of ours on their work force (which we might or might not have), in the 
future we were going to be glancing over the company&apos; s pay stubs, and we were not to see one more penny taken out in Federal 
withholding tax, otherwise we would be forced to get very proactive. On more than one occasion I had bookkeeper ladies and 
dweebs in ties and short-sleeved white shirts from small businesses assure me even while they were trembling in their seats that 
they were secretly sympathetic to the Party and the revolution and hell, maybe they were. Within a couple months I don&apos;t think 
there was a single business in Lewis County that was remitting to the IRS, nor do I believe that we ever had to use personal 
violence against anyone in this connection. By then our reputation was established and people knew quite well that we meant what 
we said, so we didn&apos;t need to. Nor did the Feds ever do more than make harassing phone calls and send nasty letters about it to the 
companies concerned, because Lewis was getting a rep as the Rebel County even then, and they knew better than to bother. 
What happened the next payday, of course, was that the employees found their paychecks significantly heavier, and all of a 
sudden it was possible actually to support a family on minimum or minimal wage. Y ou&apos; d better believe that made us real popular. 
More than once, down through the years, I have met men and women who joined the Party during the war on an underground 
basis after they got their first paychecks free of withholding, not so much because of the extra money per se but because all of a 
sudden they realized in a tangible way what the victory of ZOG would cost them. All of a sudden our propaganda emphasis on no 
income tax in the future Republic meant something. 

To be sure, this is Lewis County we&apos;re talking about here and we were small fry, economically speaking. We weren&apos;t deahng with 
any really major corporations like Boeing or Anaconda Mining or Cascade Paper or Bank of America, so forth and so on. In cities 
like Seattle and Portland and Spokane it got hairy. The Feds were willing to overlook some little picture- framing shop in Centralia 
not paying its withholding for its four employees, but they couldn&apos;t afford to let the loss of the deductions from Boeing or the 
Tacoma shipyards slide. They threatened the employers and the bookkeepers with everything from civil lawsuits to arrest under 
the Patriot Act, and they actually arrested and indicted some bookkeepers and comptrollers for show, but the simple fact is that 
here more than elsewhere. Federal threats had no teeth. They couldn&apos;t shut down all employment in the Northwest, and they 
couldn&apos; t protect every payroll office in every company. There were some unpleasant incidents wherein the NVA staged raids on 
corporate offices where the no- tax rule was not being complied with. The boys smashed computers, destroyed records, pistol- 
whipped some people who were a bit slow on the uptake in order to make our position absolutely clear to them, and other such 
boisterous behavior. Once again, word got around. Very fast. Any corporation or employer who paid withholding taxes to the IRS 
was collaborating with the common enemy, and collahoration was not allowed. 

Mmmm, as cool as the snipers were, on thinking about it I&apos; d have to say that this was probably the single deadliest and most 
effective tactic we carried out against American rule during the entire war. Some historians believe it actually tipped the scale. 
The Feds were already starting to have rumblings from the spies in Aztlan and they were terrified that the Mexicans would start 
doing the same thing we were doing to their tax revenues in places like California and Texas. The fact was that other than more or 
less empty threats, the United States government had no counter to this tactic of ours. They couldn&apos;t stop us, and we were 
bleeding them to death. At the very end of the war the Feds were looking at setting up a kind of nationwide payroll service so that 
the United States government became the paymaster for the whole empire. Under this plan, essentially all salaries were to be paid 
to the Internal Revenue Service and all employees, from the guy who flipped burgers down at the grease pit to the CEO of a 
multinational, were to get their paychecks from the IRS as a kind of biweekly tax refund, but the government&apos; s number crunchers 
discovered that they quite simply did not have the money, the manpower, the technical expertise, the computer capability, or the 
infrastructure to create such a financial Frankenstein monster. I have heard several stories to the effect that this was the point 
where the accountants surrendered, ZOG decided to cut its losses, and the first contacts were made between Washington D.C. and 

A Distant Thunder 100 



our own G HQ that eventually led to the Longview conference. Once again, a small number of people with some goddamned guts 
had stymied the mightiest empire in the world. The army that was stronger in soul won. 

Before we get off the subject of economic warfare, I need to mention that another of the major military objectives of the NVA was 
to shut down the casino and legalized gambling industry. Now, I have to admit, I am one of those old dinosaurs who believe that 
gambling is a vice. Always did, why I&apos;m not sure. I think maybe it&apos;s because my parents were alcoholics and I just have a case of 
the ass for any kind of pointless and destructive addiction that destroys family life. There was a time long before I was bom when 
everyone recognized gambling as a vice and Las Vegas was the only place it was legal, and Las Vegas was built and run by Jew 
mobsters like Bugsy Siegel and Moe Dalitz and Meyer Lansky. But along about the 1980s corporate America decided that 
gambling was too profitable to be left to mere street criminals and parasites, and needed to be brought into the big-time by 
corporate criminals and parasites. 

G ambling is a sickness and Z G exploited it to the max in order to relieve poor white people of what little money they possessed. 
The amount of money taken in every year by legalized gambling was in the untold millions of dollars, and no one ever quite 
figured out exactly what became of it There was a lot of bushwah about how money from legalized gaming, as it was called, was 
supposed to go towards education. Well, let me tell you, I went to school in the Washington state public education system, and if 
they were getting any money from the casinos it sure as hell wasn&apos;t apparent in the classroom. The fact is that legalized gambling 
was earning huge amounts of money for the secret state, the hidden powers that controlled things from behind the scenes, and to 
this day I don&apos; t know who a lot of those powers were. J ust saying it was the J ews may be technically accurate but doesn&apos; t really 
cover it all. Money from gambling just disappeared into this huge black hole, sucked into oblivion like a gigantic vacuum cleaner. 
The NVA wanted a generous helping of that cash flow, and then we wanted that money hole plugged because someone in power 
was making big bucks and that was not good for the white man. Who the hell did these casino people think they were, living like 
leeches off human weakness and misery? Lawyers? 

One of the more ridiculous things they did was relegate a large part of the gambling industry to so-called Indians to take 
advantage of the legal fiction that Indian reservations weren&apos; t part of the United States, as if Z G would ever voluntarily 
relinquish the grip of its rotting hand on anything. When I was growing up, all of western Washington and indeed all of North 
America was covered with so-called Indian casinos run by tribes that never existed anywhere in history outside some corporate 
Jew&apos; s imagination; most of the casinos were managed by some Chief Running Nose or something who was bom Bemie Bemstein 
from Flatbush. Those goddamned things were money pits that destroyed more white lives and families than dmgs and pomo and 
miscegenation combined. 

My own parents used to go up to Eagle Rock every now and then and blow whatever money they weren&apos;t spending on booze on 
the damned slot machines. The only &quot;vacation&quot; I ever remember us taking was to Lake Tahoe. I spent a couple of days when I was 
about seven years old playing all alone on the shore of the lake while my parents were in the casino, and on the last day I tripped 
on a boat dock and hit my head as I fell into the water. Some woman pulled me out. Her name was Jewel, and from what I 
remember of her build I suspect she was a stripper from the night club. She took me into the hotel laundromat where I stripped 
down to my underwear while she dried washed and dried my clothes for me, and then she bought me a cheeseburger and fries 
from the restaurant When we got in the car to drive back to Washington that night because Mom and Dad had no more money 
and couldn&apos;t afford the hotel room, they didn&apos;t even notice the bump on my head. 

A s far as shutting the casinos down, we started with simple stuff. There&apos; s a wonderful little potion called butyric acid, or 
sometimes butanoic acid. It smells like a combination of rancid butter and vomit and it soaks into anything porous, wood or 
carpet or cracks in a linoleum floor. Anti-abortion protesters used to use this stuff against the murder machine clinics. Once it is 
soaked in, only time will stop the stench; it cannot be eradicated by any known cleansing agent Rooney and me and sometimes 
Johnny Pill and The Magic ]\4an. Spider and Suzie Q. and even Ajax would go into the casinos, play the slots a bit and like tom 
cats marking their territory with urine we would leave little pools of this stuff all over everywhere. The reek very quickly drove 
even the most degenerate and determined gamblers from the casinos and would shut the joint down for days. When the NVA 
decided to graduate to bigger and better things, one of the big things we liked to do was mortar attacks on casinos to shut down 
gambling industry. This was about year three when we had finally begun to get hold of some heavy weapons, and a casino was a 
great exercise in infiltration, attack and withdrawal. They were all off in the woods on these little postage- stamp sized &quot;Indian 
reservations&quot; and so we could park, do a night move into a firing position on a hillside overlooking the casino or in the nearby 
woods, drop a few rounds in the parking lot to give all the gamblers inside time to get their heads down, then drop a couple more 
rounds on the casino itself and boogie. They were soft targets and it was a good way to break in a new mortar crew or try new 
technology with mortars and rockets. I have to admit it was fun watching all those degenerate gamblers scramble, although we 
were told that in some cases the slot and blackjack players were so intent on the play that they literally played on while the casino 
was shelled. 

And of course, we just plain robbed them. Casino heists were by no means cakewalks. The casinos were guarded by very heavy 
and well armed private security-type bmiseboys who were downright trigger-happy and always alert. They were protecting big 
money, and ZOG was always extremely serious about protecting big money. One of the worst shootouts I ever was involved in 
was during a casino robbery, and I killed a poor dumb son of a bitch, an ex-policeman who had been canned from the Seattle force 
for alcoholism named Stan Brodka. A sense of duty is a funny thing sometimes. Brodka had more guts than sense, and he honest 
to God thought he was morally obligated risk his life for the J ews who were paying him eight dollars an hour to guard their 
millions and who no doubt regarded him as bohunk white trash. 

A Distant Thunder 101 



I always felt rotten about that incident and when the Republic was finally won I set up what was known as &quot;conscience fund&quot; for 
Brodka&apos; s children. The War of Independence Victims Pension Fund under which these conscience accounts were set up was one 
of the Republic&apos; s acts of reconciliation. There were a number of those Special Compensation A ccounts, as they were actually 
called, on both sides, including some where former American soldiers and cops kicked in for the famihes of Party and NVA 
people they had done harm, to give at least some of our former enemies credit for having some sense of decency. It wasn&apos;t even 
recorded in the documentation which side you or your family member who had been killed had fought on. But anyone who 
wanted to, for whatever reason he felt compelled to do so, could make an allotment to stick a little extra every month into a 
specific War Victims pension, and that&apos;s what I did until Brodka&apos; s children grew up. The son became a Northwest Civil Guard, a 
cop like his dad, and not a bad detective as it turned out. He was good enough to find me. The conscience funds were supposed to 
be completely anonymous and the database hackproof, but one day many years ago, I hear a knock on my door and this 
thirtysomething man is standing on my porch. He introduces himself and shows me his detective shield. &quot;I won&apos;t come in, Mr. 
Ryan,&quot; he told me. &quot;This is a personal visit, not business. I just want to tell you from my sister and me that it&apos; s over. Y ou don&apos; t 
have to give us any more of your money.&quot; 

I didn&apos;t even ask how he knew. &quot;How can that be?&quot; I asked. &quot;Money can&apos;t make something like that all right, no matter how much 
time has passed. I did it only because it was better than doing nothing at all.&quot; 

&quot;I understand that, Mr. Ryan,&quot; Brodka Junior told me, his eyes and voice completely expressionless as he saw standing before him 
the man who had killed his father. &quot;I didn&apos;t say it was all right It won&apos;t ever be all right I just said it was over. It has to be over 
sometime. With Meg and me, that time has come.&quot; And he turned and walked away. 

Never forget when all is said and done, the Northwest W ar of Independence was at its heart a civil war between whites. 
Then about the beginning of the fourth year there was an abrupt change in Party policy on legalized gambling. The Seagull Casino 
in Olympia and a couple of others were suddenly declared off limits bD NVA attacks, while several of the others were bumped up 
in priority and leveled by mortar and rocket fire or else burned bD the ground in fairly heavy NVA tickles, in some cases costing us 
casualties. What had happened, of course, was that the Party had been approached and certain of the casinos were now paying 
hefty protection to the A rmy Council in order to be allowed to continue to operate, while others who didn&apos; t want to get with the 
program were being eliminated. To the benefit of the remainder, of course. AH very gangster- like. Bugsy Siegel would have 
approved. Were some of us completely comfortable with this? No. I wasn&apos;t comfortable with it But it was realpolitik in action, as 
much as I hate to say it Those gambling millions helped us buy the artillery that shelled Portland and the Third World votes in the 
United Nations that recognized us as a legitimate national liberation movement if you can believe that From that point on, that 
healthy skim we collected from the Injuns in protection fees almost single-handedly financed the entire Northwest revolution. To 
our eternal credit after Longview we resisted temptation and the casinos were shut down for good. The Running Bears who really 
were Indians were deported to the tender mercies of the Great White Father outside the Republic and the Running Noses who 
were really Bemie Bemsteins were sent bD the bottom of Budd Inlet in concrete shoes to join Brandy Morehouse&apos; s quondam 
attorney, or whatever Force 101 did with the carcasses during the Cleanup. I never asked. 

T he fourth maj or prop that needed to be knocked out from under Z G , after the mud- colored hordes and the media and after the 
Internal Revenue Service, was the legal system. There we were not the gentlest gamester playing for a kingdom at all, nor did 
even the relatively merciful Tank Thompson suggest otherwise. Some people are cockroaches who need to be stepped on. 
Lawyers, all lawyers without exception, were beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct Like the IRS agents, they got a 
single warning to get the hell out and then they were shot Like the IRS agents, the only reason they got that one warning was 
because if we spent our time hunting down lawyers we&apos; d not have had the time to do anything else. Someone once said pigeons 
were rats with wings; lawyers were rats with briefcases and they bred like rats, feeding on human misery and draining their fellow 
man dry. Judges got no warning at all. Their black robe was their shroud. Any judge who had ever sentenced a single white man 
or woman tD a single day in a prison full of nigger butt- rapists or Mexican drug addicts was hunted down like a dog and shot or 
blown bD pieces, and it was a wonderful and savage pleasure to do. The only time I ever really jammed a gasoline- soaked tire 
around someone&apos; s neck and burned them alive, it was a female judge. Most people would be haunted for the rest of their lives by 
her screams as she sizzled. I am not She died in agony, she deserved every second of it and I only wish it could have hurt her 
even more. I don&apos;t know any Volunteer who wouldn&apos;t turn from kilhng ten niggers or Mexicans for an opportunity to kill one 
lawyer or one judge. 

At first we also leaned on jurors who were empaneled in NVA-related cases, but ZOG quickly spotted that problem and simply 
abolished them, which in view of the general level of intelligence in the citizenry back then wasn&apos;t all that bad an idea in any case. 
Y ou really don&apos; t want Beavis or Butthead or Clueless sitting on your jury, never mind some Third W orlder who didn&apos; t speak 
English. ZOG invoked the Patriot Act and tried to substitute military tribunals and judge-only special &quot;security courts&quot;, which of 
course gave the NVA all kinds of nifty new targets. There were whole crews who specialized in courts and Judge Advocate 
General lawyers and military tribunal judges and facilities. ZOG recognized the necessity for some kind of formal criminalization 
of our activities and they kept tinkering with it throughout the entire war, using all kinds of special criminal courts made up of a 
hybrid of both military and civilian authority, not only b) put a legalistic stamp on their repression but also to employ the hordes of 
suddenly out of work lawyers. But whatever they tried to get their legal system back on line we smashed; you may recall that the 
last combat action of the famous Olympic Flying Column was b) destroy the special criminal court in Port Orchard. We 
effectively shut down the judicial branch of government in the Northwest Right up until the very end we were still hunting down 
judges, who were lively and dangerous targets— hell, there was that Sammy Rothstein tickle. Not only that but the War 

A Distant Thunder 102 



Prevention Bureau spent the next twenty years hunting down and punishing the worst of the judges and the attorneys who fled the 
Northwest after independence. That was a debt that badly needed paying. 

The prisons themselves were a kind of subsidiary part of our attack against the legal system. During the first couple of years we 
actually staged a number of prison breaks purely for the purpose of creating general chaos and tying down the enemy&apos; s police and 
other forces. This is a good example of the kind of brutal logic that actuated our strategic thinking. We knew that by blowing holes 
in fences, overpowering guards and unlocking gates, we were unleashing on the community a small army of thugs, drug addicts, 
cholos, gang bangers, and hoodlums, almost all of them non- white, who would proceed to victimize white Northwesters in their 
wonted manner and thus increase resentment against persons of color. Sometimes we even made ourselves heroes when NVA 
sniper teams or active service units tracked down and liquidated black or brown criminals whom other NVA crews had released in 
the first place. As to the white convicts, there was always a legend to the effect that the NVA was staging these jailbreaks in order 
to recruit criminals. That wasn&apos;t true, in most cases. We did have some of the white convicts ask to join us, but we had a standing 
rule: a white con was not considered to be one of us unless he had been racially aware and active before he went inside. God 

knows there were enough of those who were doing ten year sentences and more for putting up a sticker or saying nigger out loud. 

* * * 

Ah, yes, the old boom versus bum debate! God, we had some bull sessions on that one way into the wee hours of the morning, on 
guard duty and in the TV room of whatever safe house we were staying in! Y ou might say that the Northwest V olunteer A rmy 
was firmly divided into two camps, the boomers and the burners. Me, I was ambidextrous. I liked both techniques equally. We had 
bombers in the NVA, to be sure, some damned good ones with really intricate skills in whipping up exotic explosives, packing, 
timing and detonation devices, you name it. I remember one guy named Sleepy Sam who could actually make things out of 
plastique, nice-looking dishes and statuettes and lamps and stuff. His exploding cigars were a blast, dude, and I do mean a blast. 
One of them decapitated the United States Attorney General at a White House formal dinner, and plopped the head right down in 
the middle of Chelsea Clinton&apos; s quiche Lorraine. Some of our bombings were real works of art, like that tickle I described where 
we took down Samuel Rothstein. But the problem with bombs is that they are a wee bit indiscriminate. They cause collateral 
damage and make people hate us— understandably so. Even those whites who understood what was happening and why, and who 
might have supported us otherwise, became rather alienated if we blew up children in baby carriages and killed harmless old 
Uncle Tom Cobley who was doing his mall walk just at the moment when a bomb went off in the wrong location at the wrong 
time. 

This kind of thing happened— you can never be entirely sure how a tickle is going to go down— and to this day there are families 
in the Northwest American Republic who receive a government pension and full college scholarship because seventy-odd years 
ago some relative who died when their grandparents were sucking on pacifiers got it from an NVA bomb that wasn&apos;t intended for 
them. That was one of the arguments the bum school put forward, in that arson was mostly directed against property and there was 
a lot more time for innocents to get out of the way, although accidents happened with torch jobs as well. 
Of course, there were times when nothing else than a Baghdad banger would do. But bombs were hard to make, hard to plant, and 
required balls the size of grapefmits to deliver in a shopping bag or briefcase past the metal detectors and the sniffer dogs and the 
chemical sensors. Many&apos; s the time I have strolled into the side entrance of a shopping mall or office building or govemment 
facility carrying something that made me sweat like I was in a sauna. In the first year or so of the revolution the NVA planted 
dozens of small pipe bombs in shopping malls, little more than fireworks, really, but they made a loud bang and caused a lot of 
screaming and trampling and grim tut-tutting on television about the horrors of domestic terrorism. They also virtually emptied the 
shopping malls as the sheeple stayed away in droves, cost the mall owners a bundle when they piled on the detection equipment 
and security personnel (many of whom were NVA undercovers), and the multinational chains who ran everything from the junk 
food courts to the stupid little boutiques selling ridiculous designer fashions at astronomical prices closed down. That created 
more white discontent, and further disengaged ZOG economically from the Pacific Northwest. It created more unemployment and 
got white people really pissed off at the multi-nationals, which we then remedied by chasing out the non- whites so whites could 
have real jobs again with improved paychecks when we put a stop to Federal income tax withholding, so the NVA picked up PR 
and political brownie points on both ends. One of the many reasons we were finally able to force the bastards to the conference 
table at Longview was because there was little economic opposition from the multi-nationals, almost all of whom had disengaged 
economically from the Homeland years before when the trouble started and they started began money, and so they had nothing to 
lose and no particular reason to oppose a settlement which might allow them back into the Northwest and give them at least some 
access once again to the Northwest markets. 

And of course, there is always that soul- satisfying ka-boom that makes all right with the world and lets you know your day hasn&apos;t 
been a total waste and you&apos;ve accomplished something. I think that&apos;s why I always loved hand grenades so much. They were a lot 
smaller and safer to carry around than some of those home-made concoctions Ajax and Sleepy Sam cooked up in the bathtub or 
the kitchen sink, and in an enclosed space they were just as loud and effective. But then I was the kind of kid who always enjoyed 
flushing cherry bombs down toilets. 

On the other hand, firebugging did have its moments and its advocates. Matches or disposable plastic cigarette lighters had many 
fewer safety issues attached, and they could be carried in the pocket beside a pack of smokes as you breezed through any security 
checkpoint in the Homeland. Plus arson was amazingly cost-effective. I have always believed that the Northwest Volunteer Army 
did more damage to ZOG with a can of lighter fluid and a book of paper matches than we ever did with even the most deadly of 
our bombings. Never mind the cost of a five- alarm fire in terms of manpower and money to put it out. Fires make the most 

A Distant Thunder 103 



wonderful diversion when you need to get down and dirty across town and you want to make sure all the local blues are tied up. 
High explosives were used against human targets when it was necessary to destroy people and plant and institutions that were 
supporting the Zionist occupation and when we needed to make a statement while doing do. But in cases where we were waging 
economic warfare or enforcing General Order Number Four and removing a public nuisance, we flicked our Bic. And of course, 
for those who wanted the best of both worlds, there was always the old Molotov cocktail trick using Ma Wingfield&apos;s Home 
Cooking Oil. I&apos; m not joking. That&apos; s what we called the formula we eventually settled on for our firebombs, because Ma invented 
it. Her recipe used a little more gasoline than Carter&apos; s, a little less motor oil, and a soupgon of magnesium shavings. Swear to God, 
once Ma Wingfield&apos;s Home Cooking Oil got a home cooking, a whole firehouse couldn&apos;t put it out. NVA crews in other 
communities across the Northwest had noted our success in Lewis County and after a time burnouts of Paki or Korean run 
convenience stores from Areata to Missoula were so common they weren&apos;t even reported in the media any more. 
One of our most interesting little arson tricks was to find something nice and flammable in a targeted business, building, or area. It 
would be a pile waste, paper stocks, something that would ignite fairly readily. Then we pulled out a full paper pack of matches 
and a cigarette, struck one matah and lit the cigarette whether we smoked or not, took a couple of puffs to get the tip burning 
good, and then we opened the flap on the book of matahes, placed the cigarette inside along with the edge of the filter flush with 
the left hand side of the matchbook, closed the flap, and tossed the whole lot down into the flammable material. When the 
cigarette burned down to the edge of the match tips the whole shebang flared up into a brief but hot bum, and ignited whatever the 

flammable material was. Brother Combustion took it from there. 

* * * 

Some of the things the Northwest Volunteer Army pulled were pure propaganda strokes. We called them &quot;Robin Hoods.&quot; All that 
money that we were hoisting from banks and Mighty Marts and extorting from casinos and the ransom money from kidnapped 
hebes didn&apos;t stay in our pockets. One way or another, the Party and the NVA carried out a genuine re- distribution of wealth. The 
ZOG media accused us of trying to buy support among the population. Absolutely. Realistically speaking, our largesse probably 
worked better than all our agitprop appealing to moral and racial issues combined. We followed Huey Long&apos; s stricture and we put 
them vitUes back on the table, and the people of the Northwest did not scorn to partake of the feast. For the first time in centuries, 
other than during the brief twelve years of the Third Reich, serious wealth was being taken out of the pockets of the Jews and the 
plutocracy and was being returned into the pockets of the working class and middle class white people who had created that 
wealth. Sometimes it was as simple as cruising through a working class apartment complex and slipping envelopes of cash marked 
NVA under doors that helped pay white welfare mothers&apos; electric bills or get a sick child to a doctor. Sometimes we hit banks that 
were threatening to foreclose on a white family&apos; s homes and publicly dragged their file cabinets out into the street or into the 
parking lot and burned big piles of mortgage documents. (Okay, the real stuff was kept on computer disc, but we stole or 
destroyed those and the hard drives as well, and a big pile of burning mortgages looked really cool on the front page of the 
Dundee Advertiser or the Centralia Chronicle.) 

I recall that at one point during the war, we noticed that along with a lot of sloppy and musically lousy red, white, and blue 
propaganda crap made by race traitors in Nashville that was being played on the country music stations, all of a sudden there 
appeared out of nowhere a bluegrass version revival of an old Woody Guthrie song called Pretty Boy Floyd. I won&apos;t attempt to 
sing at my age, and I won&apos;t quote the whole song because I don&apos;t remember it, but we all noticed it was definitely susceptible to, 
shall we say, a sub rosa interpretation? The lines about the stranger coming to beg dinner and leaving a thousand dollar bill under 
the napkin, paying mortgages for farmer hit by the Depression in Oklahoma, the taxi loads of groceries bringing Christmas dinner 
to the poor, that kind of thing. It turned out that sudden blast from the past on the country music stations was one of the more 
subtle tickles carried out by the Third Section propaganda boys, but it really wasn&apos; t that far off. We supplied a lot of Christmas 
dinners, paid off a lot of working men&apos; s pickup trucks when they fell behind but had to have that truck to make a living, and we 
paid a lot of mortgages in Lewis County and kept people out of the homeless shelter. As the years of the war rolled on pretty much 
everybody in the county had a good idea of who they could come to if they were in trouble. 

One of the more popular tickles we used to go on was child recovery, and the chastisement of Child Protective Services and 
anyone who had anything to do with It Takes a Village. These people were very quickly placed on notice that they had best find 
other employment, and some of the more notorious CPS bureaucrats were publicly punished for their crimes. One of those was 
where I acquired my lifelong distaste for hangings. It&apos; s a disgusting death and they always shit and piss and you can smell it. In 
more than one case we were actually able to reunify white families who had been broken up by the United States government. 
Stealing our children was the worst thing those sons of bitahes did to us, I think. I always thought it was appropriate that the 
revolution was precipitated by It Takes A Village finally trying to grab the wrong white family&apos; s children for sale like chattels to 
faggots and yuppies. But there were a lot of people in the Northwest who had lost children to the government in various ways 
down through the years, for political reasons or because some nosy neighbor had picked up a telephone and dialed a child abuse 
hotline to claim the reward, or someone like my Mom had done it out of pure spite. We always made sure when we did these 
tickles that we weren&apos; t handing some kid back to a genuine abusive parent or parents, but you have to understand that the entire 
system was tainted beyond recall, and there were more than enough legitimate cases where kids had been torn from loving and 
secure homes because the parents or grandparents had some kind of political or racial beef on their records. We could pick and 
choose, and so far as I know we never chose wrong and the people we helped were the bona fide victims of injustice. In the first 
year we were sometimes able to prevent the abductions from taking place, and after we had killed enough U. S. Marshals they had 
other things to worry about than kidnapping white children, so we were pretty much able to shut the whole obscene program 

A Distant Thunder 104 



down, at least in the Northwest. GHQ had a Third Section unit who did nothing but try and track down the children who had 
already been taken. Y ou may remember there was a real popular Northwest Broadcasting Authority TV series about them a few 
years ago. They would actually track the kids down outside the Homeland, sometimes going as far as Hawaii or Europe to recover 
a stolen child. 

What was more important was that the word went out among the white community that we were not just a bunch of neo-Nazis 
with shaven heads and tattoos who were full of hate for people with colored skins and who only wanted to kill, kill, kill. The white 
people of the Pacific Northwest began to understand that they now had a just and powerful alternative when the Zionist 
government was screwing them over. ZOG&apos;s decisions were no longer final; there was now a court of appeal. The NVA were the 
people who brought back stolen children who had been thought gone forever, who paid the rent and the electric bill when a single 
mofiier couldn&apos; t afford it, who drove out the mud-colored bullies so that school was safe and fun for the kids again, who drove the 
Mexicans away so Daddy could get a job again, and who put extra money in Daddy&apos; s pay packet because he didn&apos; t have to pay the 
crushing Federal withholding tax. The impression began to gain ground that we were in fact interested in family and community 
problems and in the creation of a truly just society for white people. On several occasions I have witnessed the joy and the 
thankfulness of a white family that the NVA re- united when we took back children from liberal and yuppie and in some cases 
perverted &quot;families&quot; where they had been stolen and sold by the United States government. We slowly began to establish the Party 
as an acceptable and accepted part of people&apos; s lives. We started to become heroes in the eyes of the people that we wanted to 

liberate. 

* * * 

The final prop that we had to knock out from under ZOG&apos;s tyranny was the Christian right 

They were always a minority even among the established churches, and most people frankly regarded them as kooks, but 
collectively they were immensely wealthy kooks, they were probably the best organized political special interest in the Zionist 
empire, and they served as the shock troops of the establishment. We had to not only target them and leave legitimate Christians 
alone, but make sure that the public and the churchgoing public in particular knew that we were doing so. The one thing that the 
Old Man used to go into a tizzy over was that the Northwest independence movement must never, ever be perceived as anti- 
Christian in any way. The hard fact was that although we had a lot of fine comrades who were neo-pagans of various sorts and a 
lot more who were agnostics or just plain atheists, the NVA wouldn&apos;t have stood a chance in hell if people had believed we were 
trying to overthrow tiie Christian religion and make everybody dance around wearing homed helmets and bearskins and drinking 
mead, or do quasi- Druid chants in robes out in the woods like escapees from a Harry Potter movie. The undeniable fact was that 
the overwhelming majority of White people in the continent of North America and throughout the whole world was nominally 
Christian. They might not practice it in their daily lives, but they would not accept open paganism or stupid blasphemy about Jesus 
being a dead Jew on a stick, and if we had ever gone that route there would be no Republic today and there would be no white 
people left and we&apos;d all be coffee- colored zombies stumbling around the great world consumer plantation. A nti- Christianity as a 
Party policy simply was not on, yet I don&apos; t know another area in which the movement had such a difficult time coming down from 
Cloud Weird and living in the real world. 

I suppose this would be as good a time as any to discuss the religious problem within the white resistance movement, which I have 
avoided up until now out of long force of habit. We were taught to avoid it in the early days because there was no conceivable 
good that could come of discussing it, and one of the Old Man&apos;s arguably greatest accomplishments was that he finally managed 
to pound that through our numb skulls. The one topic that the Chowder Society very pointedly avoided in our discussions was 
religion, and religion was the one area where the Party discouraged the exercise of free speech among whites. &quot;We know from 
long experience that for whatever reason, the Movement can&apos;t discuss religion rationally,&quot; Red mentioned once in a firm voice. 
&quot;Religious discussion sheds heat rather than light, it is counterproductive, and we need to maintain a mutual agreement to put the 
whole topic in the back burner, hopefully permanently.&quot; 

The whole problem was a sticky one for the NVA . The Old Man on more than one occasion proclaimed proudly that the Party was 
a brotherhood of blood, not of faith, but I have to tell you that there was more than a little wishful thinking there. Just as there 
were men in the Confederate army who really were fighting for black slavery as opposed to the right of the states and their people 
to be free and control their destiny, I&apos; d be lying if I were to deny that there were some among us who considered that they were 
fighting for their version of God first and the race second, and whose vision of the coming Northwest Republic was a kind of 
high-tech Puritan New England, complete with scarlet letters and burning witches. Nor can I deny that there were comrades 
among us who were equally convinced that Christianity was the greatest enemy of our race, and anything to do withjews or ZOG 
was merely secondary. I know there were elements on both sides who were quite serious about turning their guns on one another 
after we&apos; d won. I never knew how close we came to having an Irish-style civil war after Longview, but from some of the bigger 
knobs in the Party I&apos;ve met in the years since, I understand that it came a lot closer to that than anyone wants to admit, even today. 
Thank God the Old Man finally got some power and was able to knock some heads and slap silly some people who should have 
been slapped silly long before. And the problem is still with us, as anyone who has grown up in the Republic knows. It&apos; s like 
we&apos; re simply not content to fight J ews or blacks or M exicans or A sians, like there is some perverse chromosome that demands we 
have a white enemy to hate. 

It didn&apos; t help matters that some of our enemies in the Federal ranks, including a number of very highly placed leaders, were 
openly and passionately motivated by a genuine belief that they needed to kill a racist for Christ I know it seems difficult to 
understand now, when the Jewish question is discussed openly and taught in schools and everybody knows about them, but the 

A Distant Thunder 105 



fact is that in those days there were people who actually believed that the Jews were the Chosen People of God and that all of the 
other peoples of the earth were bound to sen^e them as the so-called Apple of God&apos; s eye. How could anyone know any differently 
when questioning any of it in public carried a prison term? In any of the larger denominations, even those whose theology wasn&apos;t 
so extreme in other areas, it was worth a minister&apos; s job to even suggest that the J ews were otherwise than perfection in human 
form. The Christian rightists were the ones who fought against the Longview treaty tooth and nail, more bitterly and longer than 
anyone else. 

Now me, I wouldn&apos;t want to have anything to do with a God who would choose a people like the Jews, and I understand that 
whole business was a gross misreading of the Scriptures— hell, didn&apos;t Ma and Rooney and China tell me so often enough? If 
nothing else, just look at the Jews and their behavior, and that will put the kibosh on this Chosen People crap. But a lot of people 
didn&apos;t understand that Like everything else in the United States, the whole Christian religion had been subjected to almost a 
century of gross misrepresentation by the liberal intelligentsia and social engineers who twisted it all completely out of 
recognition. Even with my limited Biblical knowledge I could tell that there is nothing at all Christian about &apos;marrying&apos; two 
perverts in a church and claiming that God blesses a loathsome deviation as matrimony which He quite clearly condemns on 
numerous occasions in His word. That&apos;s one of the reason they banned the King James Bible and other &quot; no n- inclusive&quot; versions, 
r 11 give it to you as simple as I can. I&apos; m not a Christian myself and I never was one, somehow it just never took with me, but I 
married two of &apos;em. Remember that old saying about how the Northwest War of Independence was won by pagan men and 
Christian women? The fact that I am not a believer like my wives were does not blind me to the immense and pivotal role that 
Christianity has played in the development of Aryan civilization. I refuse to slander and belittle the theology which has given to 
the ages the magnificent Gothic cathedrals of Europe, the beauty and glory of countless Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and 
Da Vinci, the awesome poetry and sweep of the English language at its&apos; height in the King James version, a cumulative legacy of 
music, art, architecture, philosophy, exploration and conquest unparalleled in the history of humanity. I look at it from the First 
Church of Wingfield point of view, which is what I suppose you might call the traditional pre- corrupted version of the faith as 
Rooney and Carter and Ma explained it to me over the years. They sang G imme That Old Time Religion and they meant it. I&apos; m 
talking about the C hiistianity that made Stonewall J acl^on march his entire class at V M I of f into the C onfederate A rmy after a 
night of prayer and reflection. 

Firstoff, yes,Jesus Christ was ajew. Oh, all right, he was an Israelite if you&apos;re Christian Identity and you insist. Butajew of his 
time, not ours, and you don&apos;t have to be a CI to understand that. It&apos; s simple historical fact. The Jews of today are racially remote 
from thejews of the Bible, who are now extinct. They don&apos; t exist any more. Thejews of today are of three kinds. There&apos;s the 
Mizrahi, who are basically Arabs who took the Jewish religion for one reason or another down through the years. Then there&apos; s the 
Sephardim, who are again largely of Arabic descent and who came into Spain on the heels of Muslim conquerors and were 
subsequently expelled by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, the year Columbus sailed the ocean blue. And finally there are thejews 
who have caused mostof the problems we have in the world today, the goddamned Ashkenazim, your basic such- a- deal- 1 &apos;11- 
make-you Brooklyn Y id. The A shkenazim hail from Eastern Europe but they&apos; re not European in origin, they&apos; re A sian. They are 
actually an A rmenoid people descended from a race called the K hazars, who took the J ewish religion in the seventh century A . D . 
and were later wiped out by the Persians and Mongols for their trouble, probably because they were just as obnoxious then as they 
are today. The urge to wipe out thejews seems to be one of the few common denominators in civilizations from ancient Rome to 
Cochin China to medieval Germany to Tsarist Russia. There are a number of Ashkenazim who actually have blond hair and blue 
eyes, true enough. They say that means those co-religionists&apos; grandmothers were raped by Cossacks or SS men, and I don&apos;t deny 
they were persecuted in Europe. But they brought it on themselves by acting as the tax collectors and money lenders and estate 
managers for the nobility and screwing the peasants in every sense of the word. Always remember the epitaph which shall adorn 
the historic tombstone of the Jewish people one day: what goes around, comes around. 

As for the business of Christianity being a J ewish religion, well, all I can say is that any rehgion that was good enough for 
Charlemagne, St. Francis of Assisi, Christopher Columbus, George Washington and all the Founding Fathers, Stonewall Jackson, 
and Robert E. Lee is good enough for me. Well, not really good enough for me, since I never was able actually to bring myself to 
believe in it. But people I cared about believed in it and I always respected their beliefs and never argued with them about it I 
mean hell, we&apos; re all going to die sooner or later and then we&apos; 11 know for sure what lies beyond, but until then why worry about it? 
As for me and Rooney, I suppose you could say we were a mixed marriage in that she was a Bible believer and I wasn&apos;t We 
touched on it a few times, but we never argued over it because without saying so, we had both simply decided that wasn&apos;t ever 
going to happen. I once asked Ma in some context or other whether she minded having a polite skeptic like me in the family and 
she said, &quot;Son, faith is a wonderful thing to have, but although I&apos; m sure some preachers would disagree, you can lead a Christian 
life without it Y ou&apos; re a good boy and you&apos; re good to my baby, you love her and she loves you, and that&apos; s all I care about I know 
a lot of so-called Christian men who sing loud on Sunday in church and then spend the rest of the week sinning like it was going 
out of style. Including some so-called pastors. When I was Rooney&apos; s age back in South Carolina, I had a pastor with a foot fetish. 
Wanted to suck my toes, of all the ridiculous things. Given the choice between a whited sepulcher like that and someone like you 
who has a C hristian heart even if you don&apos; t have the name, I &apos; 11 pick you any day . &quot; 

Now, don&apos;t get me wrong. None of us was blind to the fact that the liberal establishment churches of every denomination were 
rotten to the core. The preachers of the established churches betrayed the White race. They preached that thejews are God&apos; s 
chosen people and thus gave aid and comfort to the enemy. They preached love thy nigger. Most of them advocated and more than 
a few practiced faggotry once things had decayed to the point where they could get away with it They kissed the ass of every 

A Distant Thunder 106 



trendy minority and every politically correct cause of the moment then went out and cheated on their wives and buggered altar 
boys. Their ministers practiced every kind of fraud to obtain money which they spent on luxurious lifestyles for themselves. They 
preyed on the faith and the weakness of the spiritually vulnerable, women, the elderly, the poorly educated and working class. 
They used religion as an opiate to keep the White wage slaves docile and obedient to Washington. This applied especially to those 
religious right doofuses, but also to the Catholic liberation theologists and lefty activist nuns and Father Trendies, and the just 
plain weirdos like Jehovah&apos; s Witnesses. 

Mormons were a mixed bag. They all seemed either to be violently against us or violently for us, because they were genuine U.S. 
loyalists, or else they were covert and not so covert Party supporters because they didn&apos; t like Salt Lake&apos; s version of theology, the 
Salt Lake Prophet&apos;s politically expedient revelations, the mainstream church&apos;s stand on polygamy, etc. Mormonism has almost as 
many odd little sects and variations as Islam does. A lot of FBI agents and even FATPOS were blond, blue-eyed, buzz-cut 
Mormons who would have thrilled J . Edgar Hoover down to his high heels and who hated our guts and killed us with relish. On 
the other hand, 0. C. Oglevy was a Mormon and so was Winston Wayne. One of the most bloodthirsty NVA crews of all was the 
Kennewick Flying Column, who had a lot of female Volunteers due to their practice of both Mormon and CI polygamy, and they 
sang Come, Come Ye Saints in combat. Third Section had a team of clean-cut Mormon assassins called the Danite Band who 
traveled the country whacking people while posing and acting as LDS missionaries, making converts while they tooled around 
complete with the short-sleeved white shirts, the dark ties and the bicycles. One of those guys was a fellow named Moroni 
Probert He packed a pair of matched Western style Colt .45 Peacemakers he called his Urim and Thummim. There&apos; s an old 
security tape of Probert taking down two FBI agents coming down the steps of the Federal building in Medford, Oregon. Two 
pistols, one in each hand. Two shots, simultaneous. Two dead Feebs. One Mormon missionary calmly mounting his bicycle and 
peddling away. I heard somewhere that after the war he had ten or twelve wives. 

The Wingfields and other Christian- Christians in the NVA hated the J udaeo- Christians like poison, and the feeling was mutual. 
Each sect regarded the other as heretics in the service of the devil. &quot;They done made a covenant with Satan, and with hell they are 
in agreement!&quot; Ma would snarl as she watched some blow-dried coiffured yay-hoo on TV pounding the drum for Israel. 
W henever we got hold of one who needed some serious wet work, before we went medieval on his ass Carter would get down on 
his knees and thank the Lord for delivering this wretched sinner into our hands that we might chastise him with scorpions, which 
really freaked out the captive tub-thumper. They were disgusting race traitors, vile lickspittle System lackeys who sold their racial 
birthright for Jacob&apos; s mess of pottage. No argument from Volunteer Ryan, folks, and I helped do some of the Holy Joes in, in 
grand style. 

But I was always able to understand clearly the difference between the Christian /a/th itself and the morally denatured people 
whom the Zionist system propped up as its alleged spokespeople. This was not religion. This was a political ideology and a 
poisonous one. We had to put a stop to anti- white and pro-Jew preaching without offending those genuine Christians who were 
potentially supporters of the Party and the independence movement, and without actually coming out against Christianity per se. 
The NVA found that our best handle on this situation was the physical cowardice of the preachers themselves. Killing them 
simply made them martyrs, it made us appear anti- Christian, and the otherj udaeo- Christian TV preachers found ways to use such 
deaths to raise more money from their pig- ignorant faithful. But public humiliation and making them look ridiculous was another 
matter. It turned out that none of them really believed in their J eeee-zus sufficiently to be willing to die for him. We revived the 
ancient A nglo- Saxon custom of the tar barrel and the feather sack especially for them, as well as other such variations as making 
the miscreant river dance down the street buck naked with a flower sticking out of his butt. Do you have any idea how hard it is 
even for the most dyed in the wool tub-thumper to get an image like that out of his mind and take that preacher seriously again? 
And like just about everything else we did, it worked. We did it a few times and then we found we didn&apos;t have to do much of 
anything again, because when push came to shove these guys simply did not feel sufficiently strongly in their cause to die for it or 
be made a public figure of fun or risk getting their snouts knocked out of the trough. Y ou might say they saw the light. 



* * * 



Finally, once we had some degree of control of the small towns and the countryside of Lewis County, the NVA put all the pieces 
together and worked on our piece de la resista nee, the severing of the enemy&apos; s west coast lifeline and the gradual cutting off of 
economic oxygen, vital supplies and materials needed to keep ZOG functioning in the Northwest cities. 
We started blowing up bridges on Interstate Five. 

Likewise our comrades in the eastern part of the Homeland began to demolish overpasses on 1-90, 1-84, 1-15 and the handful of 
other interstates that connected the Pacific Northwest with the rest of the North American continent. One of the ways in which a 
small guerrilla force must seize and maintain control of a piece of liberated turf is by controlling access to the area, and by 
preventing the through movement of enemy goods and personnel. Ambushes against specific ZOG targets were very difficult to 
set up on an interstate highway. Although it could be done, and where called for it was done, such tickles usually involved running 
battles at seventy or eighty miles an hour. The risk to the Volunteers and the danger of collateral damage against white civilians 
was high. For obvious reasons of public relations, we didn&apos; t want bullet- riddled flaming vehicles smashing into busloads of school 
kiddies on a field trip. Once we started severing the interstates we were able to force traffic off onto the smaller local roads, slow 
it down, and get it within reach, where we could get a look at it and intercept it at will. 

Remember, beginning with the end of World War Two, ZOG systematically destroyed America&apos; s railroad system and 
infrastructure in favor of eighteen- wheeled cargo trucks that guzzled diesel fuel in huge quantities and put utterly obscene profits 
into the oil companies&apos; pockets, not to mention big bucks in the pockets of those who built and maintained the great interstate 

A Distant Thunder 107 



highways. By the time of the War of Independence, virtually all cargo and transportation throughout the empire was dependent on 
the freeway system, countless millions of tons of freight every year without which nothing could function. In the major cities, 
more often than not you couldn&apos; t even get to work in the morning without getting onto a freeway. By hitting the freeway system 
the NVA had the ability to bring the whole house of cards down at one fell swoop, cutting off the flow of everything from food to 
gasoline to garden gnomes to any given area we decided we wanted to strangle. By the end of the war we were making mass 
transit between the metroplexes virtually impossible unless the NVA gave its approval and got its cut. Truck drivers in the 
Northwest became used to stopping at gunpoint at mobile NVA checkpoints on misty back roads, submitting their vehicles to 
searches, and having us help ourselves to anything we needed. We always gave receipts, of course, for anything we took, 
promising to pay after the revolution. A lot of the truckles didn&apos; t turn in the receipts but kept them as souvenirs; I&apos;ve seen more 
than a few of them hanging frame on the walls of homes and clubs and offices down through the years. 
We could also shut down mass transit in the cities themselves at will, by hitting the urban freeways and the light rail commuter 
systems. This was an incredibly potent form of economic warfare. Our urban crews adopted an old I.R.A . wheeze: on a Monday 
morning just before rush hour, they&apos; d call in twenty bomb threats against the light rail system in Portland or the I- 90 corridor 
going into Seattle or through Spokane. Each phone threat would cany the correct code word. Of those threats, two or three would 
be genuine, small bombs on a railway trestle or attach to an underpass. The rest would be bogus, but ZOG wouldn&apos;t know which 
ones were real and which ones hoaxes, so everything had to stop and traffic was backed up for miles while the FATPO and BATF 
bomb squads checked everything out, and everybody missed a morning of work. Y ou do this once a month in a city the size of 
Seattle or Portland, the red ink mounts up alarmingly, and those accountants who must eventually make the decision to go or stay 
get more and more nervous. Not to mention the expense of repairing the overpasses we actually did blow. There were key bridges 
that ZOG rebuilt six or seven times and which we blew up again as fast as they could rebuild. The Federals simply did not have 
enough manpower to guard every single freeway overpass, and those that were guarded we could eventually take out with mortars 
or Katyusha- style rockets. 

I know I&apos;ve mentioned this before, but if you want to understand why and how the NVA eventually won white freedom, you have 
to wrap your mind around just how complex and interlocking and fragile the whole infrastructure of that highly mechanized and 
technological world was. Amurrica was vulnerable, terribly vulnerable at a thousand different points to an astoundingly small 
number of dedicated men and women who simply had a little guts. Y ou take out one vital nexus of communications of 
transportation, a freeway bridge or a fiber-optic switch or the right computer database, and whole limbs of The Beast collapsed 
into flabby paralysis. We kicked and kicked and kicked, until eventually the whole rotten wall crumbled and collapsed. Once the 
white man finally made up his mind to fight, our victory was certain. I&apos; m just pissed off that it took the bastards five years of 
stubborn resistance before they finally packed it in. 

There were those in the Party leadership who wanted to bring down the whole house of cards immediately and let the chips fall 
where they may, actually induce an apocalypse no doubt complete with road warriors and total anarchy, and we could have done 
it. By the second year of the war the Northwest V olunteer A rmy could have cut off the power, the gasoline, the plumbing, the 
money and the consumer goods to just about everywhere had we chosen to do so, and we could have caused a kind of mini- 
Ragnarok in the Northwest. That we did not do so was due to others in the Army Council and the Political Bureau who preferred 
what they called a controlled descent, or as Red Morehouse put it, &quot;We shouldn&apos;t bum down the whole bam to get rid of the rats. 
After all, you know, we&apos; re going to be needing a lot of that infrastructure ourselves to build the Republic later on. We need to 
show our people something more than mindless destruction.&quot; These moderates, as I guess you could call them, advocated a 
carefully controlled campaign of gradual strangulation, once again so that we didn&apos;t alienate the white population of the Homeland 
by causing unnecessary hardship to our own people, and yet causing the limbs of The Beast to wither and die so we could prune 
them off without the whole social organism bleeding to death. 

The reality, as always, ended up somewhere in between. The way it worked out in practice in Lewis County was that beginning in 
year three, we blew a couple of interstate overpasses just south of Napavine, always in the wee dark hours of the morning and 
always with plenty of warning flares and impromptu roadblocks to prevent people from driving off shattered bridges in the dark 
and so minimize civilian casualties. We thus cut off central Washington from access from California and points south, and yet we 
left the section skirting Centralia and Chehalis intact, so that the locals could use 1-5 in getting around their own neighborhood and 
we didn&apos;t piss people off too badly. In actual fact, a lot of folks appreciated the lighter traffic, since 1-5 was an old highway, the 
money for repair and expansion had long ago been pissed away in the Arabian desert, and under normal conditions the interstate 
was always overloaded to the seams. I should add that other NVA crews all the way down into California had done the same thing 
in their own operational areas, cutting Interstate 5 into a series of sections. Y ou could still get from L. A . to Seattle on the 
interstate, but it took a lot of detours and about twice as long as it used to take. 

Lewis County residents were a little more irritated when we blew the changeover at Exit 99, cut the Twin Cities off from 
Olympia, and made everybody drive the several back routes to get to and from Oly, but there was a military reason for that. What 
that did was make sure that any enemy troop movements on the ground between the two urban areas by road had to go through 
densely forested and isolated areas, ideal for ambushes and land mines of the type we laid on Sammy Rothstein. After a few of 
their vehicles and occupants got raptured and shot all to hell in mad minutes of Shock and Awe in the wilds of Bucoda and 
Tenino, FATPO and the State Patrol and the other Zionist forces started moving by chopper alone. This increased their speed, of 
course, but actually restricted their access to areas of Lewis County where the choppers could land or into which they could rappel 
if they wanted to be fancy about it It reached the point where an almost Vietnam- like situation existed; they&apos;d chopper into an 

A Distant Thunder 108 



area of Lewis County, do a sweep or whatever they came to do, and then chopper out back up to Oly or Tacoma before dark. We 
had Uterally driven them off the ground; the night and the street belonged to ttie NVA. 

I believe the official statistic is that at any given time there were maybe five thousand NVA Volunteers on active service in the 
Northwest and elsewhere, and at the height of the war we were opposed by perhaps half a milhon FBI, military, FATPO, cops, 
prison guards, so forth and so on. Y et outnumbered as we were, we were able to shut the empire down. But there were some 
bumps in the road. 

Rooney and I were staying in a safe house, or rather safe apartment, on the fourth floor of an historic Victorian building on Pearl 
Street in Centralia. We were awakened one morning by a comrade of ours on guard duty whom we knew as Barney. There was a 
strange rumbling out in the street, like the grinding of some strange machine. &quot; Y ou&apos; re going to want to see this, guys&quot; Barney 
said. &quot;Look out the window. We got problems.&quot; 

Carefully Rooney and I both peeped out of the Venetian blinds, and we saw what the rumbling was. Pearl Street was a one-way 
street going north. Heading southward along the street was a long convoy of armored vehicles, trucks, Humvees, armored 
personnel carriers and Bradley fighting vehicles. They were camouflaged in an odd tiger-stripe pattern which I noticed was 
different from the standard A merican military &quot;chocolate chip&quot; cut. In the vehicles, many of them leaning arrogantly on mounted 
belt- fed M-60 machine guns, were uniformed men and a few women who looked kind of like a cross between soldiers and a 
SWAT team, camo fatigues but dark black Bakelite body armor and helmets with full opaque visor shields, so you couldn&apos; t see 
their faces. Y ou had to look at the hands to recognize that this new invading army was at least half non-white. On the sides of the 
vehicles and on the backs of the body armor of the troops was not the usual white and blue star insignia of the United States 
military, but the five letters FATPO. Federal Anti-Terrorist Police Organization. 
Fattie had arrived. 

Not that their arrival was unexpected. The creation of the FATPO was an open secret and there had even been a few media dog 
and pony shows shot at Fort Bragg, North Carolina where they got their training. But the Samuel Rothstein hit wherein we had 
wasted a Supreme Court Justice, the biggest nose we&apos; d taken down yet, drove ZOG almost insane with rage and fear and loathing. 
Instead of being phased into the scene the FATPO descended on the Northwest Homeland in a single huge invasion, for maximum 
effect. Nor were they lax in giving the Rebel County a demonstration of what was in store. As we watched an elderly woman 
standing on the sidewalk, probably a bit on the gaga side and not recognizing The Beast when she saw it, stepped off the curb and 
tried to cross the street. An armored car ran her down. Ran her down, crushed her beneath the treads and left her squashed in the 
street like a bug. None of the Federal vehicles even stopped and several more ran over her before screaming, shouting civilians 
managed to get into the street and drag what was left of her back onto the sidewalk. It took them several trips. 
We switched on the small TV in the apartment and turned it to the local cable news channel. We could see they were all over, 
rolling into Dundee and Olympia and Shelton and Longview, Astoria in Oregon, Bremerton and Port Orchard in the Seattle 
suburbs, Bellingham, and out east similar invading columns were lumbering into Coeur d&apos;Alene, Sandpoint, Pullman, EUensburg, 
Kennewick, Y akima. Areata in California, you name it. We turned back to the local channel and saw a live feed of them pulling 
up outside the Chehalis city hall. By now of course our team was armed and ready to make a fast break, and I was on a disposable 
cell phone with Tank, as well as six or seven other team leaders around the county. We had to assume they were listening in and 
make it quick, then ditch the phones and get the hell out of the area. There was no time for coded conversation. &quot;We weren&apos;t 
expecting them for another couple of weeks,&quot; the CO told us with a curse. &quot;I know a daylight move under these circumstances is 
risky but I want all of you fine evildoers out of these towns and into open country. We don&apos; t know but what we&apos;ve all been ratted 
out or tagged with some kind of bug or global positioning indicator and I don&apos; t want us trapped indoors where we can&apos; t bring our 
longarms to bear. But more importantly, we mustn&apos;t lose the psychological initiative. Remember, this is the Rebel County we&apos;re 
talking about here and we need to give our unwelcome guests a warm welcome, immediately. We have to steal their thunder. Is 
there anyone out there who is in a position to make a quick hit and then beat feet? Without committing suicide?&quot; 
&quot;We can give it a shot,&quot; said China Wingfield&apos;s voice on the disposable cell. &quot;Brother S. has been cooking up some hot soup that 
can bum their lips.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure, C.?&quot; asked Tank cautiously. &quot;I mean it The gear is expendable. Y ou guys aren&apos;t. Splattering some egg on these 
assholes&apos; faces is important, but you getting out of there in one piece is more important&quot; 

&quot;We&apos;ve got it covered, boss,&quot; I heard China say. &quot;We have a good quick E&amp;E route still open, and we&apos; re willing to chance it 
This is the first we&apos;ve seen of these bastards and I don&apos;t like them already. I wanna see &apos;em sizzle.&quot; I didn&apos;t know where China 
and her team were, but as it turned out they were situated similar to us, in an upstairs apartment in the St Helens Hotel on Main 
Street in Chehalis, about half a block from the city hall and with all kinds of Fatties now milling around in the street below. She 
and Sleepy Sam and The Bear and a couple of our technoid kids were in E Company&apos; s bomb factory. 
A s an interesting aside on how ZOG propaganda worked, after the day&apos; s excitement the networks and Fox News and whatnot 
ranted and raved and screamed that we had set up our explosives workshop in an apartment hotel full of low- income, white senior 
citizens, and this showed how little regard we allegedly had for the welfare of our own people. Well, that was partly true. The St 
Helens had indeed been apartments for the elderly at one stage, but about a year before all this happened the building had been 
bought by a consortium of investors from Israel who were looking for ways to get their money out of the rapidly deteriorating 
Middle East bandit state, and who had decided that the picturesque old St Helens would make ideal condos for wealthy refugees 
from Tel Aviv once the old goyim were removed and the place renovated. The Jews had finally managed to evict the last of the old 
people only a few weeks before. One of the old guys managed to pass on the keys to his flat to an NVA contact before the 

A Distant Thunder 109 



deputies dragged him away to the fogey farm, and we had slipped in and sheltered there for a few days while Sleepy Sam and the 

kids did the old double, double, toil and trouble trick using the bathtub as a cauldron. 

&quot;Do it and move it,&quot; said Thompson. 

&quot;Give us a couple of minutes and keep watahing Channel 7 for the fireworks,&quot; responded China. &quot;Charlie Team out.&quot; 

&quot;Everybody out and make sure you deep-six these phones before they can be tracked,&quot; said Thompson. &quot;Everybody to your team 

lead&apos; s E&amp;E point, and I&apos; 11 set up a table in the next couple of days. Sunray out.&quot; 

&quot;Well I&apos;ll be damned!&quot; said Rooney softly, watohing the TV. She pointed to the scene in front of Chehahs city hall. The local 

station was running what appeared to be a live, nationwide hookup via one of the networks. A muscular black man wearing 

sunglasses, a visored camo cap labeled FATPO and the insignia of a colonel was standing in front of the city hall, striking a pose 

for the media and shouting the odds. He looked lean and mean and super- dudely with his bolstered 9- mil and bulging biceps. 

Behind him on one side, looking fierce and tres paramilitary chic, was a well- stacked, light- skinned, black- haired woman, most 

likely Hispanic, leaning an M- 1 6 on her hip, with a couple of grenades hanging on what I swear was a deliberately low-cut flak 

jacket, if you can believe such a thing, that actually managed to accentuate a luscious rack and show a little cleavage. She was 

wearing a black beret and sunglasses as well. Definitely, this was a posed diversity cheesecake shot set up with the media&apos; s 

connivance. Join the Fatties and meet the bad babes in the berets. On the other side and to the rear of the babbling monkoid was a 

gigantic, hulking figure we all knew and loathed, dressed in the heighth of Fattie fashion. No sunglasses concealing his lifeless, 

piggy eyes, but a fatigue cap mercifully covered the point on his pear-shaped head. &quot;That&apos; s Leon Sorels!&quot; said Rooney, pointing. 

&quot;Wearing a lieutenant&apos;s bars, yet! Dummy-Dummy is moving up in the world!&quot; 

&quot;Journeys end in lovers meeting,&quot; I chuckled grimly. &quot;China said to keep on watohing Channel Seven, so they must be somewhere 

near there.&quot; 

&quot;Christ, I hope she doesn&apos;t get herself killed,&quot; sighed Rooney. 

&quot;Uh, Shane, didn&apos;t you say the CO said we should hit the bounce?&quot; asked Barney diplomatically. 

&quot;Y eah, he did,&quot; I replied. &quot;Y ou guys take the Nissan and beat feat We can be in Chehalis in five minutes, and so Rooney and I are 

going to hang here for a while, and if it breaks bad and it looks like they need help we&apos;ll try and bop our way in with the Jimmy 

and extract Chine and her team. I know that&apos;s non-reg, guys, but this is a family thing.&quot; 

&quot;Then we all go,&quot; said Johnny Pill, who was also there with Mary. &quot;We&apos; re all family, Shane.&quot; I didn&apos;t even bother to say thanks, 

since I had known what their answer would be. 

On the television the bottom floor frontage of the St. Helens Hotel could be seen quite clearly in the background, with a big open 

truck of seated FATPO gunmen pulled up on the street beside the side entrance, one of them pointing the mounted machine gun 

menacingly off at some unseen target off camera. The black FATPO colonel was laying the moo on thick. &quot;The people of America 

have had enough!&quot; he shouted, waving his fist in the air as he raved like a pro wrestler before a bout That must have been where 

they got their choreography for this gig. &quot;The President of the United States and the Attorney General have had enough. I have 

had enough, and Sergeant Lola and Lieutenant Leon here done had enough, and that means this racist fascist white supremacy 

bullshit is gonna come to a fucking screeching halt and I mean now, motherfuckers! Racist terrorism in Lewis County, 

Washington is now over, baby! You hear me, you white racist sons of bite hes! Dishomeboy gonna cut yo&apos; gizzud out and eat it.&apos; 

Oh, yeah!&quot; I swear to God the chimp was doing everything except beating his chest It looks utterly silly today, but in those days 

people thought that kind of thing was impressive. It was all about entertainment and this was entertainment The monkoid was 

practically screaming now. &quot;Y ou pale-ass Northwest lame cracker pieces of shit are done!&quot; 

That was when the truckload of Fatties in the background exploded into a fireball, leaped into the air, and the force of the blast 

knocked everybody to the ground including the TV camera crew. What Sleepy had done was whipped up a quick batch of 

nitroglycerin in a crock pot which he then decanted into a plastic one-gallon milk jug, which he then corked with a stick of 

dynamite with a cut down fuse. China had then calmly lit the fuse, waited for it to bum down cool as a cucumber, leaned out a 

window and let the jug fall right onto the transport truck below. Then she and her team E&amp;E&apos; d out a window and over the roof 

down through a skylight into a menswear store and out the back, down to the railroad yard and into their vehicles. The camera on 

the ground kept on rolling at an odd angle, and the viewers heard screams of agony and foul language. They saw bits and pieces of 

burning debris and charred human flesh and body parts raining down onto the grass and the sidewalk, culminating about four 

seconds later when a clearly visible, smoking human head landed about three feet from the lens and stared into the homes of 

however many million viewers were watohing. God was our special effects man that day, and that footage was shown all over the 

world and won the network a Pulitzer, not to mention the highest ratings of the year.

Things in our part of the Homeland got nasty. We had embarrassed Uncle Slime, and that was never a good idea. The FATPO 
reacted immediately to the bombing outside the city hall. That night they conducted a series of raids in the pre- dawn hours all 
across Lewis County, and their intelligence was unsettlingly good. I suspect we had Sorels to thank for that Most of the people 
they hit had in the past been at least peripherally involved with the Party, and a couple of places had served as NV A safe houses. 

A Distant Thunder 110 



Volunteers Roger L arson, Gerry Jankowski and Kevin Atwatsr were caught in a trailer in Dundee and killed in a firefight Kevin 
especially was a good kid and a good comrade, a Dundee High School and Chowder Society alumnus like Rooney and China and 
me. Also that night, the Feds came as close as they ever came to catching Tank Thompson. Tank and his wife Pam, and four of 
our other comrades were in a motel, which was usually not recommended because motels were easily surrounded deathtraps. But 
this one was run by a Party sympathizer named Craig Dennis who had taken it over from the Patels who had run it previously, said 
Patels having been persuaded to vacate with a few shotgun slugs through their windows and light tap or two on the turban with 
pick handles of the finest seasoned hickory. Dennis had set up special suites of rooms for our people, with an alarm rigged. 
Rooney and I always liked to stay there because the beds were nice and soft and yet firm with good clean sheets, and by that I 
mean that we liked to sleep there as opposed to sleeping sitting up in a car or on some forty year- old sofa in somebody&apos; s 
basement. The Fatties walked in and simply shot Dennis dead behind the motel desk, but he managed to hit the alarm button as his 
dying act. Tank and his crew made it to their vehicles in time and burst through the cordon with guns blazing, kilhng one Fattie 
trooper, so Craig&apos;s act of heroism didn&apos;t go unavenged. A 11 told that was a lively day in Lewis County. 

FATPO built themselves huge barracks and facilities out by the Centralia steam power plant, and another one just outside Dundee, 
both surrounded by heavy concrete Bremer walls and razor wire, covered by armored pillboxes with machine gun muzzles 
pointing menacingly through the slits in the turrets, and a helicopter pad complete with a small fleet of choppers. And the cells and 
the interrogation rooms, of course, with the tiled floors and drains and hoses for washing away the blood. From these base camps 
they periodically roared out in their copters, their Bradley s, and their Bremerized Humvees, and they conducted mass sweeps 
through all the communities in Lewis County. FATPO goons rounded up hundreds of people of all ages and both sexes, some of 
whom had some association with the Party, most of whom did not. It was enough simply to be denounced as politically suspect to 
be snatched off the street or out of one&apos; s home at four in the morning, dragged into one of the FATPO barracks, and subjected to 
brutal interrogation, some of it so ferocious that the prisoners died under the abuse. That was what happened to Leah Wingfield, 
Adam&apos; s wife, when Goldberg got hold of her. 

FATPO set up yet another one of those 1-800-U-SQUEAL informer hotlines that so proliferated in those days, promising full 
anonymity in exchange for information on us evildoers. Needless to say, that phone line brought out every rat and snitch, every 
crank and psycho, every petty malicious creep in the county to denounce his neighbors, his co-workers, his boss, former spouses 
and lovers, anybody at all as Jerry Rebs. At first the Zionist terror struck like a thunderbolt across the county as the roundups 
sucked in so many people that every aspect of life was disrupted, but we were able to alleviate that situation somewhat by making 
use of the same hotline. We called in to denounce people we knew to be loyal to the D. C. regime, our illustrious mayor and the 
pro- American local government and business elite among them. We actually got the idiots to round up the entire Chamber of 
Commerce. After a few weeks, Fattie figured out that the hotline was virtually useless as an instrument of serious repression 
against the NV A , and that it was just generating a lot of time-consuming and unproductive work for them, and so they refined it 
into a system of high cash rewards for informers even on top of the usual Attorney General&apos;s DT bounties, but payable only on 
genuine results. That was when it really got nasty. Remember what I told you about A murrica being a completely money-driven 
society? By then we had pretty much weeded out any NV A people who had character weaknesses of such a nature that they might 
have led to their becoming informers, or rather I should say that the struggle mostly weeded the weak brothers and sisters out for 
us, but that didn&apos;t mean that there weren&apos;t some eagle-eyed chancers in the communities we moved in who were willing to take a 
bit of risk to get at some big bucks and then get the hell out before we could figure out who ratted. Nor can I deny that we lost 
some good people to informers; WPB was still tracking some of those rats down in the United States and Aztlan twenty years 
later. 

After about two months of sweeps had produced only a handful of genuine NVA or Party prisoners and had not resulted in any 
visible reduction in the number of sniping attacks, bombings, and burnings, FATPO ratcheted up the terror a notch and the home 
demolitions began. The homes and families of anyone who was known to have ever had any affiliation with the Party or who had 
ever been in trouble for racism of any kind were destroyed, leveled by bulldozers, a trick the government picked up from Israel. (It 
didn&apos;t work there, either.) Mostof those people were either with us on the bounce, already in Federal custody, or else they&apos;d fled 
the state, but from then on their relatives and friends were liable to punishment for guilt by association. The Fatties would crash 
through the door of a white family&apos;s house in the pre-dawn hours, drag the inhabitants away or else just kick them out onto the 
street in their pajamas or underwear or whatever they slept in, and then when the sun came up and the whole neighborhood could 
watch they&apos; d rev up the bulldozers and flatten somebody&apos; s home into the ground, running over the site again and again with the 
bulldozers to make sure all the family&apos; s possessions were destroyed completely. Then they&apos; d snatch any white children they 
caught for It Takes A Village to sell. Towards the end of the war, targeted families and whole neighborhoods deemed to be 
insufficiently co-operative were rounded up, thrown into barred prison buses, and deported to &quot;relocation centers&quot; in the Nevada 
desert. Thousands of completely uninvolved and innocent Northwest people died in those tents and corrugated iron shacks in the 
115-degree heat and the sub-zero nights in winter, of disease and malnutrition, and torture and physical abuse, especially children 
and the elderly. Gang rape of female and sometimes male detainees by the largely no n- white guards was routine and a whole crop 
of mulatto and mestizo babies came into the world there. After the war, women who bore such babies became the only people in 
the Republic specifically exempted from indictment and trial under the several race treason laws. 

FATPO was of course immune from all normal legality under the terms of the Patriot Act and the Presidential Executive Order 
that created them, so long as they acted in &quot;good faith,&quot; which meant whatever the hell the government wanted it to mean. They 
went wherever they wanted to go, arrested whoever they wanted to arrest with no right of habeas corpus and no legal recourse, 

A Distant Thunder 111 



tortured and murdered whoever they felt Uke torturing and murdering, stole money or cars or booze or family heirlooms or 
whatever else they wanted to steal, and raped whoever they wanted to rape. Sometimes Fatties would simply cruise through a 
white working class neighborhood at night and fire at random through the windows. The few times the local police tried to 
intervene to stop individual assaults or criminal acts by FATPO they were beaten and humiliated and sometimes murdered. That 
jive-ass nigger FATPO commander who&apos;d had his sound byte so rudely interrupted by China&apos;s jug solo once staged a raid on the 
Lewis County jail in Chehalis to rescue by force some of his men who had been locked up for drunk and disorderly. Between 
them and us, a policeman&apos; s life was definitely not a happy one, and more of them resigned. Not all of them, unfortunately. 
The NVA struck back, of course. We fired at every Fattie we saw on the streets, and they learned in very short order not to show 
their faces outside their fortified compounds except in force. Or I should say not to show their face shields; FATPO&apos; s trademark 
was the dark, opaque visor on the helmet so that other than a few officers and people like Sorels who were already known, we 
actually seldom saw a FATPO&apos; s face at all. We laid ambushes for their convoys with Baghdad bangers and daisy chains of 
shrapnel bombs, home-made landmines and RPG fire and many&apos; s the Mad Minute. When we were able to acquire some heavier 
weapons we hit their bases with mortars and rockets. We were able to do a few creative tickles like poisoning the champagne at 
one of their booze-ups at the Dundee barracks; unfortunately, Sorels didn&apos;t drink and so he wasn&apos;t one of the three who croaked. 
But the fact was that there were just too many of them and too few of us to force them out completely. Like the A rabs of the 
Middle East we couldn&apos;t win in a stand-up, straight-out pitahed battle and we knew that to attempt it would be suicide. So we 
hung on their flanks and nipped at their heels like wolves nipping at elk or buffalo or cattle in a herd, waiting for The Beast to lose 
enough blood through all those little nips to slow down and then collapse. 

FATPO was almost impossible to put a dent in, but they were slow and after they alienated just about everyone in Lewis County 
they didn&apos; t get all that much in the way of valuable intelligence from informers despite all the rewards. They just lashed out in all 
directions like the dying throes of some kind of monstrous hydra. After the first few months we had various systems set up to 
monitor their movements, including in some cases our own global positioning indicators and other tracking advices we were able 
to plant on their vehicles. 

We also had a bit of luck when a young woman whom they hired as a civilian KP and kite hen worker in the Dundee compound&apos; s 
mess hall stayed to party one night, everybody got rip-roaring drunk, and she ended up pulling the train. I won&apos;t give her name, 
because although she&apos;s long gone she still has kids and grandkids around town. Through sheer coincidental good luck, Rooney 
and I found the girl crying and suicidal down on the waterfront the next morning. We took her to Ma and China, and after one of 
the most intense sessions of persuasion and calling down the spirit I ever witnessed, the Volunteer gals were able to flip her. She 
went right back to work and pretended she didn&apos;t mind the gang- bang, that it was all just bibulous good fun and it was her 
patriotic duty to entertain the troops, and she eventually worked her way up to clerical duties in the office and then despatoher. 
Eventually she was in the position to let the NVA know every time one of those apes farted, every move they made and every 
informer they were cultivating. A nd the Fatties never figured this out. They must have known after a while that we had somebody 
close, but it just never seems to have occurred to those morons that a white girl might object to their little forced multi- cultural 
encounters. Y ou wonder what was wrong with their minds. The colossal arrogance of the United States had to be seen to be 
behoved. 

Rather than beat our heads against a brick wall and allow ourselves to be distracted into frontal assaults against a heavily armed 
and numerically superior enemy, the NVA kept our eyes on the prize, stuck to our basic strategy, and concentrated on mostly 
avoiding the auxiliaries while we kept up the pressure on the soft targets that were our real order of business, the lawyers and false 
preachers and tax collectors and media people who kept up the fagade of American hegemony. Slowly but surely we scraped away 
the guts of United States authority. I honestly believe I can say that despite the presence of several thousand heavily armed gun 
thugs among us, we did effectively put and end to Federal rule in Lewis County, because outside the concertina wire and Bremer 
walls of the encampments, by year four it was our law than ran among the people and not Uncle Slime&apos; s. Not a penny in taxes was 
being paid to the government in Washington D. C. from our part of the Homeland. Not a single red, white and blue flag remained 
to be seen anywhere on the streets of Dundee or Centralia or Chehalis or Napavine or Tenino, although with Fattie Humvees 
rumbling through the streets it was still too dangerous for those who sympathized with the NVA to run up Tricolors. We still did 
flag actions by night, though, and those residents of Lewis County who wanted to see the banner of their new Republic usually 
didn&apos;t have to look far on most mornings when they got up. No United States or Washington state court sat in session anywhere in 
Lewis County and the few remaining attorneys were keeping a very low profile. The local police who remained had quietly 
removed the A murrican flags from their uniform shoulders; sometimes you could look at a cop&apos; s shirt and see the empty square 
where the flag patoh had been. There was not a black, brown, or yellow face to be seen other than those we knew to be behind the 
murderous FATPO face shields. Red Morehouse had set up a Party- run Community Council which served as an underground 
court and local government, dealing with everything from traffic offenses to economic and employment issues to keeping the 
sewers working and the streets in repair, and the directives of that council were more often than not being obeyed over the orders 
of the American authorities barricaded behind Bremer walls in the town halls. The FATPO S stormed through Centralia and 
Dundee and blundered around in the countryside by day, but by then we had set up what amounted to a community early warning 
and reaction system to get people out of their way and lure them into NVA ambushes. The night belonged to our guerrillas. 
We had reached a kind of equipoise. It became obvious that while we weren&apos;t strong enough to drive ZOG out by pure force, 
neither was ZOG strong enough to destroy the NVA by force. I remember hearing Red sigh once, &quot;Jesus! This could go on for 
years, decades, like it did in Northern Ireland! I really wish whoever is in charge of accounting out there in D. C. would wake up 

A Distant Thunder 112 



and notice all the red ink and get to talking some surrender sense into that bird- brained bimbo in the White House.&quot; But for 
Rooney and I, there was an increasingly confident feeling that we were winning, and we began to look forward cautiously to some 
kind of future together after it was all over. 

Then it all came crashing down. 

* * * 

One day in early spring seven of us were in a safe house in Napavine. South Sound Brigade had lately acquired a number of laptop 
computers with wireless internet connections, and we had a series of techniques by which we could use these to communicate 
between our crews with a reasonable degree of security. Nothing as straightforward as e-mail or chat rooms; the Feds had been 
monitoring those for subversive content since September 1 1&apos;^ 2001 and had never even bothered to conceal the fact. We had 
covert e-rnail addresses and cedes forvvhen we ctoolutely had to talk to each otherthatvvc^, of course, but it was still pretty rislg^. 
It was sirrpler to set up a connection through various proxy servers and firewalls and whatnot that our corrpjter people had 
created, and then converse in code on public bulletin boards and things lite Usenet groips. The main use of the internet in those 
days was to transrrit and receive pornography. It was estimated that at least 90% of all net traffic involved sex in some wey . There 
were over 200,000 pomo Usenet groups alone, and we utilized several of them as our own private NVA bulletin boards because 
they were the most secure. The sheer volume of traffic from a worid of perverts made it far more difficult for ZOG&apos; s pactet- 
srdffing software and other spyware to intercept, break down, and analyze for suspicious patterns. I won&apos; t get into what our codes 
were because not only are they totally beyond the bounds of any acceptable utterance today, but they refer to perversions that the 
mgority of people in the Republic dori t even know exist, which is how it should be, and there&apos; s no need to remind anyone. But 
they were suffidenfly conplex so that we could carry out an almost normal discussion on any topic right under ZOG&apos; s nose. 
That day we got a request for a support run from Company D, Bob Corrigan in Olympia, relayed to us through Tank Thompson. 
The Delta boys had hit an apartment on Ruddell Road in Lacey the night before, where a couple of FBI counter-terrorism 
intelligence officers had been developing a woman as an informer, a drug addict who was willing enough to rat on her fellow 
dopers, but the Feebs were trying to get her close to Corrigan&apos; s crew through her brother, whom they knew to be a Volunteer. She 
had drawn the line at betraying her own family and flipped, got in touch with the brother, betrayed her handlers, and set them up 
for the chop. In the process of taking care of the problem, one of Corrigan&apos; s Volunteers had been shot, and our own medic Bones 
had been sent up to take care of him. The wounded Volunteer was okay thanks to Bones&apos; skill, and was on his way to one of our 
unofficial field hospitals just across the border into British Columbia, but Brigade wanted Bones to stick around in Olympia for a 
while because of anticipated actions there and in Tacoma and the near certainty he would be needed. Corrigan&apos; s crew was now 
dangerously low on medical supplies, and Bones needed to carry a full kit for his next casualty or casualties. He needed gauze 
bandages, paper tape, syringes, morphine, surgical thread, alcohol, sterile surgical gloves, antibiotics, surgical antiseptic, and some 
more units of plasma and whole blood of all types. Tank wanted us to take him up a load of supplies from one of our caches and 
also do a taxi. He assigned Rooney and me, Tom Bumham, Mack the Knife, and a foreign volunteer of the kind we were getting 
more and more from overseas, a Scots kid newly arrived from Glasgow called Ronnie, who had showed himself to be a cool and 
reliable hand thus far. 

I was considered the senior man, although to be frank I never figured I rated it and I never would take any official rank. I always 
worked out the logistics of all our tickles with Carter or Red or Tank, who were both smarter than I was, and with Rooney as well 
who was damned sure smarter than I was. This one didn&apos; t seem to call for any special planning, though. It was all straightforward. 
We were to take our usual two vehicles, in this case a Volvo and a Range Rover, pick up the medical stuff from the stash, and then 
we were to go into Chehalis and pick up a sixth Volunteer named Rock whom we were to transport to Olympia and drop off 
where he told us, before proceeding to make contact with Corrigan, deliver our supplies, and then ease our bodies on back to 
Napavine. There was nothing unusual about that. Taxi jobs were almost as common as supply runs; I can&apos;t count the times that I 
picked up somebody on a street comer somewhere and drove them to another street comer ten miles or four hundred miles away, 
never got or gave a name, and never saw them again. On this run I would be carrying an Uzi with a magazine pouch, and of course 
Henry the Fifth, my prized Webley revolver. Rooney had her Beretta in that sexy shoulder holster, Tom had a sawed-off shotgun, 
while Ronnie had aMAC-10 submachine gun and Mack the Knife had a fine old broom, plus we had a grenade or two all around. 
We were lightly armed because we were not going out to seek trouble, and if we ran into any on runs like these we always escaped 
and evaded out of it if we could, rather than engage. We usually could. The Northwest is a big place, like I said, especially in the 
dark. 

When he gave us the assignment Tank told us there would be a Fattie roadblock out in Chehalis that night and he told us where it 
would be so we could avoid it, which we did. We left at sundown, Tom and me and Rooney in the Volvo, Mack and Ronnie in the 
Rover. We made it to the stash, the farmhouse of a friend of Smackwater Jack we called A rthur, who had all kinds of stuff in his 
attic and his basement. We got what we needed and loaded our vehicles with the supplies, and since we were a bit ahead of 
schedule I batted the breeze with Arthur a bit while his wife filled our thermoses with good strong Northwest coffee and loaded us 
up with sandwiches. Then we headed into Chehalis, sliding in via a series of back streets, our windows open in the cool but not 
cold night so we could hear as well as see. Tom was driving and Rooney and I were in the back seat, her on the left behind Tom 
and me on the right. A light rain started misting down as we slid onto Kresky Avenue and then turned left into a small strip mall 
where we were to collect Rock outside a twenty-four hour pharmacy, one of the few that hadn&apos;t been wiped out of business by the 
big chains. I had met Rock a couple of times before, since whatever he did for the NVA required periodic visits to Lewis County. I 
knew him by sight, a guy about my age, a little heavier, auburn hair, fuzzy attempt at a beard. He was supposed to meet us out 

A Distant Thunder 113 



front of the drug store, wearing a red baseball cap on his head, it didn&apos; t matter what kind, so long as it was on backwards in the 

heighth of hip- hop fashion. We took our first swing by, Mac and Ronnie ahead of us in the SUV, and sure enough, there was 

Rock, standing in front of the well-lit pharmacy, hands in the pockets of his jeans and looking like your everyday Beavis or 

Butthead, red baseball cap on his head. 

On his head firmly straight and even, the bill forward. 

&quot;Look at the hat,&quot; said Rooney calmly. 

&quot;I see it,&quot; I said. &quot;Tom, he&apos; s in trouble but he&apos; s alive and we have to try and extract him. Pull over, let us out, and we&apos; 11 get him to 

the comer there where you can pick us up.&quot; 

&quot;Too late,&quot; said Bumham. A black unmarked car slid out of the parked vehicles in front of the Rover. Mack the Knife floored his 

accelerator and smashed into it. Masked and body-armored figures appeared out of nowhere. Ronnie the Scottie leaned out the 

passenger side of the Rover and cut loose at them with the MA C - 1 submachine gun. I looked over in time to see Rock crumple to 

the sidewalk as a FATPO stepped from the shadows and shot him through the head with an M-16. &quot;Hit it!&quot; I yelled to Tom, and 

the Volvo roared out of the parking lot, Rooney and I scattering a couple of grenades hither, thither and yon out the windows as a 

parting gift. I saw the lights of the Rover disappearing around one of the buildings, so at least they made it out of the ambush. As 

per usual, Fattie was a day late and a dollar short. We were now roaring back into Chehalis down Gold Street I looked up and saw 

lights. &quot;Tom, we got a chopper up above.&quot; Bumham didn&apos; t even reply; he simply cut his lights and made the first right he could. 

For the next ten minutes we twisted and tumed through the residential areas of Chehalis with no lights. Fortunately for us, it had 

been years since the city had been able to afford to turn on the street lights anywhere off the main drags, and so it was dark except 

for what light came from the houses of the locals. 

Tom took a left turn too wide and smashed into a parked car beside somebody&apos; s house. The door opened and a man came out 

waving a baseball bat, yelling, &quot;Hey, you? What the fuck? Look at my car! Now, I don&apos;t even bd/eve you think you&apos; re going to 

drive away, motherfucker!&quot; He lumbered towards us waving the bat. As Tom backed up the Volvo I stepped out of the car, leveled 

the Uzi at a high angle with one hand and peppered the guy&apos;s roof with a short burst. &quot;Northwest Volunteer Army!&quot; I roared. He 

stopped like he&apos; d mn into a wall and in the glow of his porch light I saw the guy&apos; s face go slack with terror. 

His wife was standing in the doorway. &quot;No!&quot; she shrieked dismally. &quot;Don&apos;t! In God&apos;s name, please don&apos;t! We&apos;re not Americans! 

We&apos;re one of you! We hate America! Please, please, for the love of God, mister, don&apos;t do it!&quot; 

I laughed genially, &quot;Ma&apos; am, next time you want to pretend to be one of us, the proper form of address is comrade, not mister,&quot; I 

called out. I reached in my pocket and pulled out a handful of bills, I guess maybe four or five hundred bucks. I leaned over and 

stuck it in the guy&apos; s shirt pocket as he let the bat fall nervelessly from his hand. &quot;That&apos; s for your car. Some Fatties are behind us. If 

they ask you any questions, you tell them it was just a Rasta man who be smoking de herb, mon!&quot; Y es, I know, that was complete 

gibberish, but the adrenalin was pumping pretty hot and you don&apos;t make much sense at such moments. I never did, anyway. 

&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; babbled the guy, and then I was back in the Volvo and we were off, all three of us laughing like demented loons 

at my stupid joke. Terror and adrenalin makes you laugh a lot, sometimes. Some of our getaways from tickles were downright 

hilarious. 

&quot;Rasta man! Rasta man!&quot; yelled Rooney, leaning over and giving me a kiss and a hug. Tom pulled out onto Main Street. Off 

ahead off to the left, up a small side street, I saw a Chehalis police cmiser pulled into a convenience store parking lot at an angle. 

The light was very poor but we could be seen coming as we passed under the streetlights, and I saw two shadowy figures mnning 

out of the store and crouching behind the unit They must have gotten a call on us and had decided that for tonight anyway live 

and let live didn&apos;t apply. I saw the shadows draw their guns and hunker down behind the squad car as if to fire. Tom hit an 

intersection, the light was red, and he at least had to slow down to make sure he didn&apos;t slam into anyone going through it I opened 

the right rear door slightly, stood out and up bracing myself with my left hand inside and balancing the Uzi against the Volvo&apos; s 

roof with my right hand, and I fired several short bursts at the two cops as we drove past The distance was maybe seventy yards 

and a little uphill, but I&apos; d gotten pretty good at shooting while in motion. I saw the sparks of my round strikes on their car and I 

heard the little cracks and saw the little muzzle flashes as they popped their G locks at us, maybe eight or ten rounds, a couple of 

which ricocheted behind me. I jumped back down into the seat, slammed the door, and Tom roared on past them and hung another 

right 

I looked over to my left to say something to Rooney, and in the glow from a passing street light I could see a bullet s spider- hole 

in the left rear window where the round had hit Rooney was sitting there with her hands at her side and her head resting on the 

back of the seat her face tumed towards me, and she was grinning at me, grinning like a maniac, her lips pulled back from her 

teeth in a rictus, her eyes flat and still. She wasn&apos;t moving, and I knew at once without any doubt that she was dead. The front of 

her jacket and blouse was dark and bubbling with blood; the bullet had actually hit her just under her left jaw and snapped her 

neck and severed her carotid artery. There was blood all over the inside of the car and blood on my own clothes. She must have 

died instantly, without even so much as a second to even think a last goodbye to me. 

I don&apos;t remember much after that I didn&apos;t go to pieces, apparently, which was good. Tom told me once, much later, that I talked 

to her dead body all the way out to his E&amp;E post which was a disused beach cottage at North Cove. He didn&apos;t get into any 

specifics about what I said, and I never asked. I do remember sitting on the porch of the cottage and watching the sun come up in 

the east behind me, and remembering how Rooney and I had done the same thing on the moming after our prom night when she 

had worn my corsage on her denim jacket and we had spent the night leafleting and spray-painting for the Party.

There are some kinds of suffering that are simply impossible for the human tongue to convey. I won&apos; t even try. I&apos; 11 recount later 
on how I was tortured in prison by the FBI, and it&apos; s a pretty gross story, but I will tell you this. I would rather go through another 
dozen sessions in B ruce G oldberg&apos; s electric chair than to have to relive that one morning when I sat there and watched the Pacific 
turn from dark to wine- colored to blue- green, and the sand turn white, and heard the birds sing, seeing that denim jacket and that 
corsage and her hair in the dawn breeze. Hearing her voice from that other dawn years before in my mind, saying &quot;It will be even 
more beautiful when we&apos; re free.&quot; Knowing that this was the first morning of all my mornings to come, that I would spend without 
her. Whatever punishment I ever had coming to me for all the truly bad things I did during that war, God laid them on me then, 
and as far as I am concerned my debt is paid in full. G od played an unspeakable practical j oke on me. He gave us all the Republic 
and the freedom for our race that Rooney and I fought for, but he denied me Rooney for all these seventy- odd years. Me and God 
have a bone to pick. I&apos; m going to croak fairly soon, and then me and G od are going to have a quiet word of prayer, and He ain&apos; t 
gonna like what He hears. 

Tom made the necessary calls, and by noon as many of the family and the crew as he could get hold of had arrived at the beach 
house. Carter and China and John Bell, and Red Morehouse, as well as George Douglas and a couple of others who had sat with 
her in the Chowder Society back in the old bam classroom days. Ma was down in Portland and John Hunt out in the field 
somewhere with his Column, which was good in one way because of them all, I don&apos; t think I could have faced Ma. Carter came 
up to me on the porch. I looked at him. I still hadn&apos;t been able to cry for Rooney. Come to think of it, I don&apos;t think I ever did. That 
was never a time or place for tears. &quot;I killed her,&quot; I told her father simply, looking at him calm and clear and most likely quite 
insane. &quot;Y ou gave her to me, and I threw her away.&quot; It was a stupid statement on the face of it, since it had been a straight 
shooting situation and Rooney had just been unlucky enough to catch one, but you should understand that I was conscious of no 
untruth when I said it I believed that I had killed her. She had been where she was and she&apos; d been doing what she&apos; d been doing 
because of me. In that sense I was responsible and the guilt was just as terrible as if my wife had died because of some specific act 
of negligence or betrayal of mine. That feeling is still there, way in the back somewhere, even after all these years. I suppose you 
never really get rid of it. 

Carter sat down and looked back at me. &quot;That is horse shit, and don&apos; t you ever let me hear you say anything like that again, or I&apos; 11 
break your jaw,&quot; he said to me. &quot;My child&apos;s death was fore-ordained on the day four centuries ago when those morons at 
Jamestown traded two perfectly good barrels of sipping whiskey to some Dutchmen in exchange for twenty niggers. Bad deeds 
have consequences, and especially vile and evil deeds have especially vile and evil consequences, and sometimes they even go 
beyond the seventh generation the Bible commands that the sins of the fathers must be atoned for. Generation after generation of 
our people lived out their lives as disgusting cowards who left this job to be done and this bill to be paid by us, may they bum in 
hell. Y ou and me just paid another jot on that divine tab that we never mn up, and we&apos; re gone pay more before it&apos; s done, but 
somehody has to pay that tab! God will not be mocked. He will not be cheated of his due. He will no longer give the white race a 
free lunch. The reckoning for our weakness and our sloth and our cowardice as a race will be paid, and all the damnable, heart- 
wrenching, soul- destroying interest that goes with it. Because until the scales are balanced nothing good can ever come again in 
the world.&quot; 

There was a protocol for burying Volunteers who were killed in action, and whose bodies weren&apos;t taken by the enemy. Wherever 
possible the remains were given to the surviving family if that family were above ground themselves, in both the physical and the 
political sense, so that our dead could receive a public interment, a Tricolor on the coffin, and if possible a firing party with black 
sweaters and ski- masks. Rooney and I had both donned the balaclava and participated in several such firing parties for the benefit 
of the news media. In this case there were no open and above-ground relatives and so we would have to bury my wife ourselves, 
in secret, lest ZOG seize her body and cremate her and flush the ashes down the toilet hke FATPO liked to do and later boast of, 
or bury her in some unknown, unmarked pauper&apos; s grave beside winos and niggers. In such cases, our people were always buried 
with a Tricolor of some kind, even if it was only one of the pre- 10/22 ornaments, and also with a paper signed by the ranking 
officer giving the name of the slain Volunteer and a brief description of his or her service and the circumstances in which they had 
died in action. We also buried them wrapped in plastic sheeting so that there would hopefully be something left in that far off time 
when we could come back for our loved and honored dead, and love them and honor them before all the world with no more 
mnning and hiding. In this case all we were able to find for her shroud were heavy-duty black plastic garbage bags, several of 
which we pulled over her legs and her head. Someone, Carter or China maybe, had smoothed her features out so that she no longer 
wore that horrible grin, and closed her eyes. I watched her now peaceful face disappear beneath the black plastic, never more to 
see her in this world. Before we bound her tight with cord, China stepped forward, bent down, shifted the bags and put the 
battered and tattered, faded green stuffed alligator Chompus in with her sister. &quot;He was Rooney&apos; s before he was mine,&quot; she 
explained. &quot;We used to fight over him. He is hers now, forever.&quot; It seemed right that she should have something with her from 
South Carolina. 

So we buried my love in her garbage bags beneath a solitary pine on a hilltop high over Chehalis. A fter she was covered and the 
branches and leaves laid over her to conceal her from the monsters of ZOG who would seek to desecrate her resting place. Noble 
Gill opened the Book and spoke the words of the Forty-Sixth Psalm we had heard together, hand in hand, on the night of October 
22°&apos;^. &quot;He breaketh the bow...He snappeth the spear in sunder... I shall be exalted among the heathen, I shall be exalted in the 
earth. For the Lord of Hosts is with me... &quot; 
Shadows. Just shadows. 
How could shadows take my love away from me?

Some years later I went through a kind of nostalgia phase, I guess you&apos; d call it. People in the Northwest Republic were just 
starting to get interested and get into serious historical research about the revolutionary period, now that enough years had gone by 
to give it a little distance and make it history, and I was able to get hold of one of the Party&apos; s chroniclers who helped me track 
down in some archive or other the actual police logbooks and reports and documentation of that night. Long story short, I ended 
up knowing who those Chehalis police were who had heard the Fattie radio call, and who on that one night of all nights had 
decided not to ignore it when they saw us coming down the street. One afternoon I found myself sitting in my study reading their 
meager report of shots fired in the dim and rainy night. The shadows at long last had names. 

There were two of them. Not FATPOs, just ordinary cops. Their names don&apos;t matter now, since they&apos;re both long dead. There was 
only one bullet, so just one of them is guilty and deserves to have his name erased from human memory, and the other is innocent 
and should not be falsely accused. The older man of the two was a problem cop who had a number of disciplinaries in his jacket 
for excessive force, drinking on duty, and so forth. He had gone to rehab for a couple of months for alcoholism, at taxpayer&apos; s 
expense, of course. About four months after Rooney was killed he was placed on suspension for boozing for the umpteenth time, 
and while he was off duty on this enforced vacation he was racing his dirt bike through the woods and he managed to drive 
himself over a cliff and break his neck. His autopsy showed his blood alcohol level to be 1.2. Was he drunk that night beneath the 
street lights? His track record shows he might have been. Did my darling die at the hands of a drunk who just happened to hit a 
one in a hundred lucky shot? Did that goddamned liquor bottle manage to inflict one more blow of agony on me even after Mom 
and Dad were through with me? Do the gods have that kind of cruel sense of humor? 

The younger cop stayed with the force for the entire war. After Longview he and his family must have been worried, because they 
fled the country and settled in Arizona, of all the hellish places. After ten years down there in Aztlan amongst the cholos they had 
applied to come back to Washington, surprise, surprise. As part of the process of his Homecoming, the former cop had to make a 
full admission by affidavit to the Bureau of Race and Resettlement and appear in person for a hearing before the Truth and 
Reconcihation Commission, detailing his American military service and stating whether or not he had been involved in any 
activity the Party considered criminal, i.e. torture of prisoners, liaison with FATPO units, recruiting and suborning informers, 
participation in FBI raids or activities, etc. The cop listed a few minor acts of co-operation with the FBI. That call on a rainy 
spring night in Chehalis wasn&apos;t on the list. Why should it have been? He didn&apos;t even know what he had done. He and his family 
were allowed to Come Home and he got a job in a furniture factory where he was still working at the time I acquired all this 
information. Although I didn&apos; t recognize the name, it is entirely possible that I had seen this guy on the street in Chehalis or 
Centralia or Dundee, both before and after Rooney&apos; s death. But was it him or his boozehound partner who had fired the bullet that 
killed my wife? Looking over their two brief incident reports in the archives, I understood that neither of them realized they had 
hit anyone at all. Like me, in the darkness they had seen only flickering shadows in the oncoming Volvo on the rainy street, and 
the popping muzzle flash of my Uzi, and they had popped a few rounds in the direction of an enemy who was shooting at them. 
For them it was a minor occurrence. There was a lot of shooting in those days. They had survived it, written up their reports and 
gone home thankful, one to his wife and one to his bottle. It was impossible ever to determine which of them had actually fired the 
shot that killed Rooney. 

So now I had a name, what the hell was I supposed to do with it? Go and confront the surviving man? Stan Brodka&apos; s son had that 
same choice to make a few years later with me, and he chose to do it, but this business with finding out about those men and 
Rooney happened before young Brodka came to my house that day, so I had no guide. Why should I go see this former cop over 
something which by that time was twenty-odd years in the past? He and I both had new lives to live. I had come as close to 
finding out the truth as I ever would. The guy couldn&apos; t tell me anything I didn&apos; t get from his yellowed report and he&apos; d probably 
forgotten all about the whole thing. Should I try to get some kind of apology from him? Why? I&apos; d shot at him and tried to kill him 
first What the hell should I have expected him to do? And even if he did apologize, either because he sincerely regretted what had 
happened or else because he figured it would be politic to appease a vet who&apos; d fought on the winning side and still might make 
trouble, what would that gain? It wouldn&apos;t bring Rooney back. I now had all I would ever have of her in my memory, the smell of 
her hair and the sound of her voice and the feel of her head on my shoulder out there on that loading dock on the golden afternoon 
of 10/22, as we knew the world was changing and we couldn&apos;t wait to be part of it all. How could dragging up the past and 
making this man feel bad for a life he didn&apos; t even know he&apos; d taken help anyone or anything? So I decided I knew all I&apos; d ever need 
to know to satisfy my own mind, and I let it go. 

I did something else. I didn&apos; t tell China that I had found out the man&apos; s name. Never did. It was the only thing I ever withheld from 
her. This was either a very kind and noble thing to do, or else a very foul and disgraceful thing to do, and to this day I am damned 
if I know which. 

A couple of years ago, by sheer coincidence, I was in a church cemetery in Chehalis attending the funeral of the last old comrade 
from Echo Company to pass on besides me. It was Volunteer Barry Robinson, aka Spiderman, the one who with his girlfriend 
Suzie Q. had gone with us on the Rothstein tickle. As the only remaining representative of the Old NVA Association in the 
county, I personally laid the wreath and planted the little Tricolor flag on the grave. I was leaving with one of my sons, going 
towards the car, when I happened to pass a headstone with a name I recognized. It was the name of the Chehalis cop who was one 
of the pair who had been sitting in the convenience store parking lot that night, and who may or may not have fired the shot that 
killed my wife Rooney, if it wasn&apos; t his partner the drunk. He&apos; d been dead almost ten years. I also saw that on his grave was a 
small red, white and blue Amurrican flag, indicating that he had fought on the Federal side during the war. Graves of U. S. 
veterans are the only places where the Masonic dishrag is allowed to be displayed anywhere in the Republic. This man had Come 

A Distant Thunder 116 



Home because he couldn&apos;t bear actually to live in the United States that he&apos; d fought to presence, and presumably he kept his 
mouth shut about it all for the rest of his life, but in death either he or one of his relatives had decided to make a final statement 
and give us evildoers the finger. Well, we&apos; d won. I guess we&apos; re big enough to take a final defiant bird- flip from an old enemy. 
I looked down at his grave and I said to him the same thing Stan Brodka&apos; s son said to me. &quot;If s over now, buddy,&quot; I told him. &quot;It 

took a while. For me and most likely for you too, but it&apos; s over. Have a good one.&quot; Then I walked away. 

* * * 

After we buried my wife Tank Thompson sent me out to eastern Oregon on some routine mission that wasn&apos; t really necessary. He 

told me that once I delivered the material I was supposed to deliver, I should take a few days off and recuperate. I told him, 

&quot;That&apos; s not necessary, boss. I&apos; m on top of it.&quot; 

&quot;Well, let&apos;s make sure,&quot; he said. &quot;Even in the middle of a war, Shane, a man who has suffered your kind of loss needs some time 

to himself. We owe it to you and you owe it to us, and to yourself, to get it all in perspective.&quot; I knew what he was doing. He was 

giving me the opportunity to pack it in and leave if I couldn&apos; t handle the Volunteer life without Rooney. The thought of deserting 

my comrades would have occurred to me even less after Rooney&apos; s death than before, since the NV A was all the family I had 

besides my drunken mother who didn&apos; t count, but I wasn&apos; t offended. From the C &apos; s point of view the test made a very hard kind 

of sense. Far better for me to go ahead and take French leave now than come back and try to function in the NVA as an emotional 

basket case, and maybe crack up under pressure in some way and get some others killed as well as myself. One of our Oregon 

comrades had been apprised of the situation, and I was given the use of a hunting and fishing cabin that overlooked the upper 

reaches of the Columbia River, right up near the first dam. Now it&apos;s the Robert Miles Dam, but I can&apos;t remember what it was 

called in those days. It&apos; s a very lonely country out there, almost desert- like, with huge green sweeps of hills and mountains almost 

like the Scottish Highlands, but more bleak. I hung out there for three days, slept a lot, ate Spam and beans, looked out at the wild 

emptiness and thought about Rooney. At night I heard the wind whistling around the eaves. On the fourth day I got in my car and 

began the long, careful drive on the back roads back to Dundee, avoiding Fattie roadblocks and bombed-out roads and bridges. I 

reported back in to A rthur&apos; s farm, where Tank was headquartered, and no one said anything to me. 

I assumed we would simply pick up as if Rooney had never been there, I understood why that had to be, and I was okay with it. I 

knew she would have gone on without me had I been the one who caught the bullet. But that night I was surprised to see the whole 

Wingfield clan drive up in two SUVs, Carter and Ma and China and John Hunt and John Bell, and even Adam, come all the way 

from Idaho. Tank called us all into the bam. &quot;We have a fallen sister to avenge, and like the ancient Greeks and Romans, we&apos; re 

going to stage some funeral games in her memory,&quot; said Tank. &quot;Y ou might call this the Rooney Ryan Memorial Tickle.&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;We gone take care of something in this community we should have took care of long ago,&quot; said Carter. &quot;We&apos;ve been working on 

it for a while, but it&apos; s time we got this one done.&quot; 

&quot;Y eah,&quot; rumbled Adam. &quot;We gone kill Leon Sorels.&quot; Adam had actually grown up in the South Carolina Low Country, and it was 

still in his speech. 

&quot;She would have liked that,&quot; I said, nodding. 

&quot;If s time we sent that particular message,&quot; agreed Tank. 

&quot;So when and where do we send it?&quot; I asked. &quot;I thought Leon stayed pretty much behind the Bremer walls unless he comes out 

wrapped in body armor, armed to the teeth, and surrounded by his gun thugs. Hell, we&apos;ve been trying to catch him in the open for 

years, now.&quot; 

&quot;He&apos; 11 be open tomorrow nighf at the Forest Lodge Motor Inn, off Exit 88 on the Dundee side,&quot; replied Tank. &quot;We&apos; 11 catch him in 

the parking lof going in.&quot; 

&quot;How do we know he&apos;ll be there?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Honey trap,&quot; said Tank in a neutral voice. 

&quot;Y eah, from what I hear that will sure work on that kinky bastard, but what makes you think Sorels is going to show up alone? 

He&apos; s really cagey and he knows we want his ass bad. Surely he&apos; 11 at least bring some of his goons with him?&quot; 

&quot;He&apos;ll be there, alone.&quot; said China. Idiot me, I still didn&apos;t get it 

&quot;But how can you be sure?&quot; I persisted. 

&quot;Because he&apos; s been there before,&quot; she said simply. Then I understood and I just sat there gaping. I knew that such things were 

done by the NVA, of course. There have always been women spies and they have always used the same weapons, but nonetheless 

the revelation fell on me like a ton of bricks. China got up and walked ouf which you didn&apos;t do to an NVA commanding officer in 

the middle of a briefing, but Tank looked at the floor and said nothing. I turned to Carter and Ma. 

&quot; Why?&quot; I shouted. &quot;How could you let her?&quot; I demanded of them in rage and pain and confusion. 

&quot;I told you, son, we&apos;ve got to pay the tab,&quot; her father replied in a level voice. I suddenly knew that I was hearing the voice of a 

man in hell. 

&quot;In Bible times, God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son,&quot; said Ma, her eyes filled with tears. &quot;God showed His divine mercy and 

stayed Abraham&apos; s hand. These aren&apos;t Bible times, Shane. God has demanded of me and my husband that we sacrifice our 

children, and He has not stayed His hand this time, because His people have become so wicked and cowardly that we no longer 

deserve His mercy and His succor. We have to earn it all back now. This time the sacrifice must be made. Shane, I have two 

daughters, both of whom I have offered up to the Lord for the sake of our people. Y ou loved one. I beg of you, don&apos; t hate the 

A Distant Thunder 117 



other, because it is our sin that she bears upon her head. The sin of a hundred years when we should have fought against the Devil 

and his works, but did not.&quot; 

&quot;Adam?&quot; 1 asked. &quot;John Bell, John Hunt? Christ almighty, Sorels? Don&apos;tyou have anything at all to say?&quot; 

&quot;Say what, Shane?&quot; replied A dam roughly. &quot;That we&apos; re all dying inside? Like you think it could be any other way? Our younger 

sister is a soldierjust like her older sister was, Shane. She&apos; s doing her duty, and now you do yours. Shutupandlistento the CO. 

We got a war to win.&quot; 

I didn&apos;t say a thing for the rest of the meet while we set up the details on how we were going to kill Sorels. Vehicles, escape 

routes, weapons, contingencies, timing and approach, the whole nine yards of a usual NVA operation. I couldn&apos;t even look at any 

of the other W ingfields. A fterwards, when I was pulling sentry outside with an A R- 1 80, down near the gate to the farmhouse, 

China came out and sat down on the swing beneath the tree I had chosen for my post. She didn&apos; t say anything, and 1 knew she 

wouldn&apos;t unless I spoke first. &quot;Is this why you and Ted aren&apos;t together any more?&quot; I finally said. 

&quot;Part of it, yes,&quot; she told me. 

&quot;I suppose I should ask why it had to be you?&quot; 

She spoke in the darkness. &quot;We had to get really close to him to get him out from behind the body armor and the Bremer walls and 

the herd of bullies that A mericans hide in. W ith his— tastes— this was the only way. He&apos; s an animal. I don&apos; t think there&apos; s any 

really human thought processes going on in that pointed skull. When he&apos; s not killing and torturing he thinks about two things, 

lifting weights and women, and we couldn&apos;t think of any way to get to him through pumping iron. I&apos;m the youngest, I&apos;ve grown 

up since he last so me, and so he wouldn&apos;t remember me from before the war, except maybe as a high school kid in a braid and a 

long dress. It worked. He didn&apos; t recognize me. Rooney was married. I&apos;m not Do you want to know the details?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; I said. Suddenly it struck me how much China had grown up and how much she resembled her sister, although not as tall, 

and her hair was a much darker brown. But she wasn&apos; t the child I had met that first night doing her homework at the kitchen table 

before supper. Jesus, she must be nineteen or twenty years old now. She had somehow turned into a woman without me noticing 

it, which is what seems to always happen with girls. 

&quot;Thank you. Shane, do you think I&apos; m a whore now?&quot; 

&quot;It&apos;s not my place to think about things like that,&quot; I said. 

&quot;Y ou&apos; re evading the question, which means you probably do, but I can hardly argue with you. lama whore, and I know it But 

Shane, as God is my witness, I would never do it with a nigger or a spic oragookorajew! I&apos; d kill myself first and if I didn&apos;t 

Dad would kill me and he&apos;d be right to do it&quot; 

&quot;Y ou know there are Party women who have done just that when there was no other way to get something we needed?&quot; I asked. I 

knew it I didn&apos;t like to think about it but I knew it 

&quot;Y es. My heart goes out to them in their suffering and their shame. I can&apos;t do that I don&apos;t have their courage.&quot; 

&quot;Y ou&apos;ve got all the courage any woman could ever want Chine. Just like your sister. Chine, does he... does he hurt you?&quot; 

&quot;Every time,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;In body and in mind, in every way that a man can hurt a woman, he hurts me. Shane, even though 

you know I&apos;m a whore now and I&apos;m worthless, please, kill him for me! Kill him!&quot; She started crying and left 

So we whacked Leon Sorels. What goes around finally came around for the big man himself. The Northwest Volunteer Army 

caught up with Dummy-Dummy in the parking lot of the Forest Lodge Motor Inn beneath the neon lights, all alone, no body 

armor, no gang of Federal thugs, no rich men to look the other way, no Amurrican flag to hide behind. Sorels was swaggering 

towards the room where China waited with a sawed-off shotgun of double-ought buckshot to do it herself if he got past us, but he 

didn&apos;t He saw us coming, he knew us, and he raged like a bull and fought with the same mindless rage. The only good thing I can 

say about that son of a bitch is that at the end, he wasn&apos;t a coward like so many of his kind. He had that much Aryan left in him. 

Or else he was just too stupid to be afraid. Beneath a street light in that parking lot we shot the monster a dozen times just to slow 

him down a bit I put a couple of Webley slugs in his kneecaps with Michael Collins&apos; and Rooney Ryan&apos; s name on them. Carter 

leaped on him and wrestled the 9- millimeter pistol from his hand, and then Adam Wingfield did the honors with a chain saw, 

carving his gigantic carcass as delicately and precisely as a Christmas turkey. The sounds Sorels made as he fell to pieces, still 

living, I will not even attempt to describe. I grabbed the head when it fell to stop it rolling under a car. I picked up that bald pointy 

sucker in both hands by the big j ug ears, and I swear to G od it still tried to snap at me and bite me. J esus, those must have been 

some steroids he was on! Then Ma did what she did best: she cooked. She doused the remains with gasoline and set them alight I 

went into the motel room and hugged a weeping China to me and whispered to her, &quot; You are not a whore!&quot; We drove to the 

Dundee FATPO barracks and hurled the severed head over the Bremer wall. Our message was sent At long last Lewis County, 

Washington was free of Leon Sorels, free of the tyrant he served, and everything he stood for. There was no going back. Not ever. 

* * * 

Some years after Longview, when it was plain that the Republic was going to be around for a while, and when Chine and I 
decided the time was right to bring Rooney home in every sense of the word, we contacted the National War Graves Commission. 
On another drizzly day in spring we went back to the hillside outside North Cove where we had buried her. It hadn&apos;t changed 
much. The lone pine was still there. It took a couple of hours of electronic probing and then digging, but eventually the guys&apos; 
shovels turned up the black plastic of the garbage bags. They stopped digging and called down to their truck, and then the standard 
aluminum transportation coffin was hauled up the hill on a travels. 

Their foreman, a big middle-aged fellow named A ndy who wore the War of Independence medal on his Labor Service overalls, 
came up to us. &quot;Y ou know, we do this a lot and I&apos;ve got some experience in how the families feel,&quot; he said gently. &quot;This part of it 

A Distant Thunder 118 



isn&apos; t really something you need to see. C an I ask you two a favor? W ould you wait down there on the road for us? W e&apos; 11 bring her 
down to you as soon as we get her up.&quot; So China and I went back down the hill, and after a while they brought the aluminum 
coffin down. I looked at the coffin and I thought not of the bones that lay within but of the rotted remains of a stuffed green 
alligator I had grabbed off China&apos; s bed on the morning of October 22&quot;**, so long ago. We had already decided that Rooney and 
Chorrpjs would be re- irttened as they were, in the shroud of black plastic wr^ped around her body on that terrible de^ long ago, 
ty those who had known and loved ten Volunteer Rooney Wingfield Ryan was buried in the EHmdee Veterans&apos; Cemetery, with 
full military honors. A lone piper pieced Going Home, and a firing party was provided by the Old NVA Association. On her stone 
is not the Bible verse from Psalm 46 that was spoken over her first grave, but my own personal epitaph for my friend, my 
comrade, my lover, my wife. It is from the greatest Bard of our Folk out of all of time: 

Cowards die many times before their deaths. 

The valiant never taste of death but once. 

* * * 

One day soon after we chpped Dummy- Dummy I was sent on a cash run to a realtor&apos; s office in Dundee where my old friend and 
former employer Sherry Cahoon was now working as a real estate agent, and also functioning as a Party banker and postmistress. I 
was supposed to pick up an envelope of cash for E Company, which presumably contained a large cut of our casino shakedown 
money. We hardly ever went on revolutionary expropriations any more; we actually now had an adequate supply of money if not a 
plentiful one, and the CO didn&apos;t want us taking unnecessary risks and maybe pissing people off by robbing them. We were a bit 
short-handed that day, so while we took two vehicles I was accompanied by only one Volunteer, a guy we called Fast Eddie who 
had been with us about a year and had a good track record, so I wasn&apos; t worried about backup. It was going into summer and it 
would have been very conspicuous for me to wear anything on the street in the daytime that was heavy enough to conceal King 
Henry the Fifth, my beloved owl-clip Webley, so I went really light, just a .380 in an ankle holster clip. This wasn&apos; t anything 
complicated at all, just straight in and out, pick up the envelope and bring it back to the CO. It was always those little simple gigs 
that somehow went bad. 

It was a warm afternoon. I parked a couple of blocks down from the real estate office and across the street, crossed to the north 
side of Second Street in the crosswalk, and moseyed on down towards my destination while Eddie cruised. I looked down the 
street and I saw a rare sight, two FATPO troopers on foot patrol, wearing full body armor and carrying their M-16s at the ready. 
Usually they never exposed themselves like this, and we had learned that when they did, it usually meant they were using some of 
their own people as bait to try and provoke the NVA into an attack so they could in turn ambush us. Five would get me ten there 
were a lot more Fatties somewhere in the area, walking a parallel course, and possibly even more concealed in buildings along the 
street and rolling through the area plainclothes in unmarked vehicles. The Feds didn&apos;t seem to be showing any interest in the real 
estate office where Sherry worked, but they were walking towards me and if I kept on my present course I would have to pass 
them on the sidewalk. I decided it would behoove me to be elsewhere, and it was best to evade them while they were still a couple 
of blocks away. I turned and casually looked into a store window, and then just as casually eased my body on down the street back 
the way I had come, not wanting to appear as if I were running from them. My car was across the street in the parking lot. Should 
I turn right and try to evade them on foot, and maybe run into whatever Fatties were parallel- patrolling in the alleys or up First 
Street? I decided to get back behind the wheel and motivate. 

I looked both ways before stepping into the crosswalk, and I saw the coast was clear except for a big blue Cadillac rolling slowly 
towards the intersection from the right. I could see a small white female head with thick glasses behind the wheel. It was a 
common sight Since most public transportation had now been shut down because all the infrastructure money had been pissed 
away in Iraq or outsourced to India, small Northwest towns were plagued with elderly drivers who had no business at all behind 
the wheel of an automobile, but who had no other way to get to the store or get to their doctor&apos; s appointments. They were a real 
traffic menace, but this woman was far enough down the street so she had plenty of time to stop, and so I stepped into the 
crosswalk not even looking, my eyes surreptitiously to the left, keeping an eye on the FATPOs. I felt a sudden blow and saw a 
burst of orange flashes, then it was lights out. 

The little old lady in the Cadillac had run me down. She had been in some kind of senile fugue state, and either she hadn&apos;t seen me 
or else she hadn&apos;t been able to react in time, and she had come barreling right through the crosswalk and knocked me flying. I 
figure I was out for only a couple of minutes, but that was enough for the two Fatties to come up, see the .380 in my ankle holster, 
and grab me. I learned later that it was indeed an ambush and by the time Fast Eddie turned the comer my position was 
surrounded by several Humvees and a mounted M-60 was pointing straight at him. He turned the nearest comer and took off, as 
he should have done, but the FATPOs were too excited about catching a white boy with a gun to notice or care. By the time I 
recovered consciousness I was lying in the back of a FATPO paddy wagon, my hands lashed behind my back with plastic 
disposable cuffs, a broken collarbone and cracked bone in my hip plus numerous abrasions from the car accident. I looked up and 
I saw an impassive Third World face of some kind staring at me, wearing a FATPO uniform. Filipino? Polynesian? South 
American Indio? Who knows? Somebody who sure as hell had no business on the North American continent. There was blood 
streaming down my face and into my eyes. I tried to clear my vision and say something, but the wog said nothing. Instead, he 
leaned over and calmly sprayed Mace into my face. The pain and nausea convulsed me, my skull and lungs seemed to explode, 
and I did the first of quite a bit of screaming I would do while in Federal custody. He maced me a couple of times all the way back 
to the FATPO compound. 

A Distant Thunder 119 



Oh, yeah, you scream. Everybody screams. Once again, the way Federal captivity has been portrayed on Northwest TV and in our 
movies is kind of off the mark. Big strong NVA Volunteers standing up to torture with a sneer and a smile, responding with quips 
and wisecracks and insults and promises of A ryan vengeance. Okay, I understand why that has to be for propaganda purposes, and 
to be sure some of us stood up to the torture, the most notable and noble example being Cathy Frost, who endured things so 
obscene that no full account of what was done to her by the FBI had ever been published. But everybody screamed. Believe it. At 
Auburn they had speakers in the cells and we used to get a daily karaoke of screams as our comrades were tortured because they&apos;d 
pipe it in. When my turn came I sang as loud as anyone. It was the FBI version of Muzak. 

At the Dundee FATPO base I was treated for abrasions, a twisted kneecap, a cracked rib and a broken hip, without anesthetic. No 
one even bothered to interrogate me; they just ran my fingerprints and photographed my retinas in order to identify me, then 
shaved my head and tattooed a number on the back of my skull which you can still see a bit through my thin hair back there, 
although I&apos; m told it&apos; s pretty faded after seventy years. A s a bit of historical trivia, they didn&apos; t shave the heads of women prisoners 
because one of their tortures was to pull a woman&apos; s hair out by the roots or set it on fire. They always put the number tattoo on her 
buttocks, so we weren&apos;tthe only ones who did that if you&apos;re still worrying overwhatwe did to that reporter. Then the FATPOs 
gave me a couple of perfunctory beatings which reopened the wounds and necessitated their being done up again. After about a 
week I was taken up to the big high-tech Federal Detention Center in Auburn, just south of Seattle. 

Auburn was not my most edifying experience in life by a long shot, but again, as reluctant as I am to give ZOG one inch, if I&apos;m 
going to be honest about my past I have to admit that it could have been a lot worse. I had a few things going for me that some 
didn&apos;t. For one thing, I was a very small fish in a small pond and the Feds quickly figured out that I wasn&apos;t on the big-ticket 
reward list, nor had they convinced themselves that I knew all kinds of secrets like they thought poor Cathy did. Also, I was 
captured towards the end of the war when the NVA had long since made it entirely clear that there were certain Federal practices 
which would not be tolerated, and which would bring retaliation so horrific even by our standards that the Feds did in fact 
grudgingly give in and change their behavior. So I wasn&apos;t thrown into a bull pen with twenty big buck niggers who beat me to a 
pulp and then forcibly buggered me up the ass, which had been known to happen in the early days of the struggle. 
This practice had led to our use of what was called the &quot;necklace&quot; as a special punishment for anyone guilty of abusing NVA 
prisoners. We got that one from the South African kaffirs. The abusive guard or cop had to be abducted or otherwise secured, and 
a large rubber truck tire soaked with gasoline was jammed down over his head and his shoulders tight enough to where he 
couldn&apos;t get it off. Then the tire was set on fire and he who had dished it out had to take it, as he was burned alive. It only took 
three or four of these necklacings and all of a sudden NVA prison accommodation became strictly seg. The necklacings are not a 
pleasant part of our past, true, but they were another good example of how a little bit of courage and a little bit of willingness to do 
the necessary succeeded in bringing about actual change in the government&apos; s behavior. &quot; W e don&apos; t negotiate with terrorists&quot; my 
ass! Bum a couple of those motherfuckers into charcoal, and the Americans will negotiate faster than you can flick your Bic, once 
they understand that they could be next. American prison authorities had used homosexual rape or the threat of it as a disciplinary 
measure against white inmates for generations. Being buttfucked by niggers was considered to be simply a part of going to prison 
and TV comedians actually made jokes about it Then the bureaucrats and thugs who did such things were made to understand that 
they would be held responsible for their behavior, and that the mighty United States of America could not protect them against 
punishment. Certainty of punishment, not just severity. The practice of throwing handsome young white boys like Y our Friend 
and Humble Narrator in with nigger perverts came to a screeching halt. 

The main thing about Federal political prison was that it was so completely inhuman, like the government it served. The guards 
were specially chosen military police from the various branches of the American services, and also some regular Federal 
correctional personnel. They wore black coveralls with a utility belt, body armor, and the face shields that concealed their 
identities except in the case of actual interrogation room staff. They spoke to the prisoners as little as possible and when they did 
their voices were carried through some kind of microphone inside the face shield, so the impression of their being robots was 
increased. The prison was simply a form of warehousing, and I was inventory who had been captured and was now placed on a 
shelf in my proper slot. We were manhandled like pieces of meat, slammed around and physically dragged up and down the 
corridors without even being given the chance to walk. At no time during my captivity was I ever charged with anything, brought 
before a judge, or given any semblance of a trial. If I had asked for a lawyer I would have heard what laughter from those helmet 
mikes sounded hke before they beat the crap out of me. All of those things had gone out years before with the Patriot Act and 
none of us seriously expected it After all, we were only getting the same treatment Muslim prisoners had been getting at 
Guantanamo Bay since 2001. 

A year or so before there had been a mass escape at Auburn FDC when a Volunteer drove a panel truck up to the gate and 
detonated it and almost two hundred NVA people had scampered out into the night eventually to rejoin tiieir units and causing a 
major setback in the government s pacification program. The result was that they&apos; d changed the system and Auburn was now in a 
permanent state of lockdown. The facility had been rebuilt in order to prevent the detainees from communicating with one another 
at all, and although I occasionally saw other NVA people in the facility being escorted or more accurately dragged around the 
place, I could only rarely even exchange a whispered word or two in passing. When we were caught doing so we got a shot from 
the agonizer, a spray injector carried by the guards which forced a solution of some kind of acid beneath our skin in a patch about 
the size of a nickel. It hurt like sin and if they gave it to you at the base of the spine or in the backs of the knees you&apos; d be crippled 
for a couple of days. Y ou never left your cell without full manacles, leg irons, and belly band. Some of the prisoners I saw being 

A Distant Thunder 120 



dragged around were hooded as well. I have no idea to this day why some of us rated hoods and others didn&apos;t. All I know is that 
for whatever reason, they never hooded me. Like I said, I was never that high on their totem pole. 

When I arrived at Auburn I was jammed into a small, boxhke cell all on my own, and left for a while to heal up so I would be nice 
and healthy and sizzle for a long time in the chair. Unlike any other prison I have ever heard of, we were never even given 
numbers and other than G oldberg himself I don&apos; t recall any of them addressing me by name. I finally figured out that if they&apos; d 
assigned numbers to us it would be a form of identity within the system, it would leave a paper trail of some kind, and that there 
were circumstances wherein ZOG might not want to acknowledge that we had ever been there at all, which was a chilling thought 
We could disappear any time they wanted us to, and some NVA prisoners did. 

Each of us had tiny individual cells, with the walls made of some odd spongy material so we couldn&apos;t commit suicide by running 
against them and dashing out our brains. There were no windows and the place was ventilated purely by air conditioning from a 
single high vent. Sometimes they would pump hydrogen sulfide, rotten egg gas, into the air conditioning vents and make us sick 
and nauseated and weak with puking and dry heaving. I never did figure out why. I suspect it was just for meanness. There didn&apos; t 
seem to be any other point to a lot the things they did at Auburn. There was a sort of block in one comer with a thin foam rubber 
mattress and no pillow, and a stainless steel toilet with no seat, and a sink. Other than that, nothing else. No chair, no table, no 
mirror. There we stayed for twenty- three hours per day. For one hour every day I was manacled and taken down to a glassed-in 
exercise room almost like a handball court, and instead of walking in a yard I was put on a treadmill, a stairwalker, with my cuffed 
wrists attached to a bar, and the guard started the machine. Y ou climbed the stair for a solid hour or else you got some badly 
barked shins. I used to look forward to the treadmill because it exhausted me to the point where I would sleep when I got back to 
my cell. There was nothing else to do for the next twenty-three hours. 

Well, I think it was the next twenty-three hours. I always assumed we got one exercise per day, but after a while I couldn&apos; t tell. 
The first thing you lost at Auburn was any sense of time. There were watahes or clocks, no calendars, the guards would simply hit 
you or juice you with their agonizers if you asked them what day it was, and no windows to the outside at all, so you didn&apos; t know 
whether or not it was night or day. Showers were at intervals that might have been once a week. At least my orange jumpsuit and 
my carcass both were usually pretty ripe by shower time. I would be dragged down to a small glassed-in shower cubicle, uncuffed, 
stripped of my jumpsuit if I didn&apos;t peel it off quick enough, locked in the shower cube and then hit with about three minutes of 
water from top and side nozzles. Sometimes scalding hot, sometimes ice cold, sometimes lukewarm. No soap, no washrag; I 
would claw the dead skin and dirt and crud from my body as best I could with my fingernails while the shower was going. I was 
then given maybe twenty seconds to dry myself with a piece of cloth the size of a dish towel, then tossed another jumpsuit and 
another pair of cardboard disposable slippers, knocked around a bit or hit with agony juice if I didn&apos; t dress fast enough, manacled 
again and dragged back to my cell until the next time. 

Meals appeared on a Styrofoam tray at what might have been normal intervals. I couldn&apos;t really tell since I had no points of 
reference to tell time other than my body clock, but it seemed to me that meals were staggered— judging by my hunger sometimes 
there would be as long as twelve hours or more between meals and sometimes as little as an hour. There was no differentiation 
between the meals to tell which was supposed to be breakfast. I&apos; m sure that was something they did deliberately to confuse us and 
disorient us. The food was awful, a couple of cuts below TV dinners or airline food, but very similar, and of course never enough 
of it. The Styrofoam tray would be sealed with cellophane and would contain three &quot;courses&quot; : a small square or patty of 
something that might have been some preparation of meat, a starchy yellow or white vegetable of some kind like com or baked 
beans or some cold mashed potatoes, a greenish vegetable like peas or string beans, a single slice of bread with no butter or 
margarine, and a wax paper half pint of milk. Sometimes the meat would be a single cold hot dog, sometimes a little patty of some 
ground meat that tasted odd, sometimes a single small chicken dmmstick (at least I assume it was chicken; it might have been 
pigeon the way it tasted.) To eat this feast with we got a plastic spork, a spoon with a couple of small tines on the tip. After the 
war it came out that it was a common practice for the Feds to dmg the food of certain prisoners to keep them quiet or induce 
hallucinations for interrogation purposes etc. So far as I know they never bothered to dope me, but they did try to drive me insane. 
Overhead was an inset flourescent light that was on twenty-four hours a day. It was like the Ministry of Love prison described by 
Orwell in 1 984, &quot;the place where there is no darkness.&quot; Or so I thought— until one day the light went out, and for G od alone 
knows how long afterward I was in total blackness. 

I mean total blackness, complete absence of light, the kind of total darkness that occurs nowhere in nature. The only sound in the 
black was the sound of the air conditioning, and then after a while that went off and there complete silence. There was no food 
appearing in the little slot in the door for a long time, long enough for me to get really hungry. I think the idea was to convince me 
that something had happened, the prison had been buried by an earthquake or a nuclear bomb had hit or something, or else that 
they&apos; d just decided to kill me by entombing me alive. I thought out all the variations about what might be going on, and I decided 
that either the light and the air conditioning would come back on and I would live, or else it wouldn&apos; t and I would eventually die, 
and since I had no say of any kind in the matter I might as well just sit back and see how it played out. So I found my way to the 
sink in the darkness. I found it wasn&apos;t working and the water in the toilet was treated with some kind of disinfectant and so wasn&apos;t 
drinkable. Not good. I knew I couldn&apos; t let myself think about being thirsty or I&apos; d lose it, so I lay down on my bunk and put myself 
into a kind of fugue state separating my mind from my body, something I had gotten very good at during my time there. My time 
spent in the Dundee library as a kid once more stood me in good stead. I started traveling in time like Professor Standing in Jack 
London&apos;s The Star Rover. I re- lived my Ufe in my memory as closely as I could, starting from my earliest recollections of the nice 
house in Dundee when we still had some money and before my brothers became scum, and then progressing on through the 

A Distant Thunder 121 



Bobby Fernandez incident so forth and so on. With a long digression on all the books I&apos; d read; I think under those intense 
conditions I was actually able to re-read Penrod in my mind with maybe 80% accuracy. 

If you totally concentrate your mind you can actually shut off the thirst and hunger signals from your body. I was almost up to the 
point in Dundee High where I met Rooney when the lights came back on, and in a way I was glad. It was still too soon for me to 
re-live those memories. The air conditioning came on again and a cool breeze seemed to waft away a bit of the stale stink of my 
own body and waste. I have no idea how long I was in darkness, but the light almost blinded me. I staggered to the sink. It was 
working again and I shoveled cupped handful after handful of water into my mouth, and I flushed the stinking toilet over and over. 
The meals resumed at whatever intervals they came at I got dragged to the shower again, and the whole routine resumed like 
nothing had happened. The only thing I can figure is they wanted to see if I would lose my mind. 

Then one day the door opened and in stepped two of the guards. This time they did not wear masks, which was not a good sign. 
There was a big huge nigger with a shaved head and one of those little Lion of Judah goatees the homeys liked to wear, a kind of 
black Dummy-Dummy, and there was a chunky blond buU-dykey woman, thirty -something, dishwater blond. Behind them came a 
man in a suit his face somewhat older and his hair a little more gray than I remembered. Special Agent Bruce Goldberg. 
&quot;Y ou look like jack shit Shaney, me bhoyo,&quot; he said, grinning at me like a loon. &quot;Y ou really should have made that call all those 
years ago, Shane. Y ou really should have.&quot; I knew by his voice he had become quite insane. The mask he had worn when we first 
met at D undee High was gone, and the J ew was no longer pretending, no longer hiding. Now he j ust let all that T almudic hatred 
hang out I&apos;ve always thought Jews were a bit nuts anyway. Any race of people who would elevate paranoid schizophrenia to a 
religion would have bD be. He who had been trying to drive me out of my mind with the blackness had failed, and now he was nuts 
and I was still sane. I knew then I could beat him before he killed me. I sat up on the bed and then staggered to my feet to face 
him. I stared at him, my eyes still blinking from the bright flourescent light and since I knew he was going to kill me anyway and 
it didn&apos;t make any difference, I moistened my lips and said, &quot;Sorels spilled his guts about you before we cacked him. We know 
where you live now, kike. Y ou&apos; re on the to-do list Y ou&apos; 11 be seeing your big buddy soon.&quot; The nigger and the dyke waded into 
me with their short lead- weighted truncheons and I didn&apos; t get to complete my sentence. A fter the beating was over G oldberg 
loomed over me while they held me upright in their arms, battered and bloody and dazed. 

&quot;Oh, my, what a bad and tough little Nazi it is. Bad little Nazi must sizzle!&quot; he babbled, tittering loathsomely. All the time the 
guards were dragging me down the hall and down the flight of steps to the chair Goldberg was dancing around us like a demented 
child giggling, &quot; Sizzle! Sizzle! Bad Nazi will sizzle and then we will see how tough it is! Sizzle!&quot; I had never been in that part of 
the prison before and as I looked over the stairwell I saw nets had been stretched between the banisters and the wall, in order to 
prevent prisoners from throwing themselves off the tiers and committing suicide. I remember reading they used bD do that in 
Russian jails back in the time of Stalin. Then they dragged me into a fairly large room to the chair, and there I sizzled, to 
G oldberg&apos; s transcendent delight 

The chair was on a kind of platform, presented almost like a throne. It looked like what it was, an electric chair, but not one for 
carrying out simple executions. On the back was not a headpiece hke on Old Sparky, but an iron collar I later learned was based 
on the Spanish garrotte. At the back of the collar was a long- handled crank. When the crank was turned the Federal torturer could 
apply a nice, even constriction of the windpipe, without any embarrassing crushing of blood vessels or breaking of the neck that 
might terminate the interview abruptly before any useful information had been gained. I also saw that the front half of the seat had 
been cut away, so that the actual seat was nothing but a kind of small shelf to perch my butt on. I discovered the reason for that 
soon enough, when they began wiring me up. A bout six feet behind and to the left of the chair was a large UPS type generator of 
the kind used in computer systems to maintain an even electrical current from which ran a long cable which ended in a board 
through which protruded some metal discs on wires, the electrodes. There was a control panel on a table beside the generator, and 
a box marked sterile syringes. I&apos;d heard of the needles; we all had. Both the Feds and the NVA called them Dershowitz Doozers. 
I was manhandled into the room by the two guards, while a third one, a Hispanic of some kind, waited by the chair. In their usual 
style they didn&apos;t say a word, just handled me like a piece of meat They stripped me naked as a jaybird and then strapped me into 
the chair. We later learned from studying the FBI&apos; s interrogation psychology and procedure manual, which was called the 
Dershowitz Protocol, that in interrogating white male &quot;racists&quot; a white female officer was always there to add a deliberate element 
of sexual humiliation. With women prisoners the guards were always non-white males. They closed the collar snugly but not so 
tight as bD cut off my breathing or my speech just yet then they began swabbing assorted parts of my body with some kind of 
jelly-like lubricant to increase conductivity. Then they attached five pairs of the electrodes with paper hospital paper tape. Special 
Agent Goldberg had gone off somewhere during this procedure, but now he entered the room, very businesslike in his crisp suit 
and carrying briefcase. He sat down at the table behind me, and although I couldn&apos;t see him or move my head I could hear him as 
he opened his briefcase and riffled some papers about &quot;Good morning, Shane!&quot; he said cheerily as if we were meeting for a 
yuppie business breakfast The entire bizarre outburst in my cell and as he danced down the hall behind us might never have 
happened. I wondered if the Jew freak even remembered doing it He was that wigged out &quot;Dear me, dear me, you really should 
have made that call like I told you to a few years ago,&quot; he said again. &quot;Racism and hatred doesn&apos;t pay, me bonny lad, it really 
doesn&apos;t it as you are about to find out Shall we begin?&quot; And we began. 

Once again the luck of the Irish seem to have kicked in. This will take a bit of explaining, so pardon me if I digress. About five 
months before I was captured, I had taken the wheel for a hit up in Seattle with two of our heavier guys up there who had heard of 
my driving skills, an Australian named Charlie and this lean, mean kid just off the plane from Italy named Bill Vitale. Y eah, that 
Bill Vitale. This was after he survived the Ravenhill ambush that wiped out Tom Murdock&apos; s boys and he didn&apos; t talk much, but 

A Distant Thunder 122 



Charlie was fairly laid back and while we were sitting in the car waiting for the holy rabbi to make his appearance we had a long 
natter, and he gave me a good 41 1 about dealing with torture. The man knew what he was talking about and he saved me from 
disgracing myself. Charlie had once been arrested in Britain under the Race Relations Act and worked over by the Special Branch, 
who used pliers instead of electrodes and not just on the nuts but fingernails, teeth, etc. &quot;If s mind over matter, mate,&quot; he 
explained. &quot;When they start putting the hurt on you, mate, wot ya gotta do is make yeself a mantra in your mind. Y ou gotta 
convince yeself in yer own mind that yer mantra is the answer to all their questions, that it&apos; s wot they&apos; re really asking yer. In my 
case it was &apos;Big beef bones for our dog.&apos; Get that inter yer mind, and make yeself believe it&apos; s the truth, that&apos; s wot they really want 
to know and ye&apos;ve got to make them beheve you. Kind of a Zen type thing, know wot I mean? Anything they ask yer, ye justyell 
&apos;Big beef bones for our dog! &apos; and they&apos; 11 figure ye&apos;ve gone off yer nut and let you alone for a while to sane up.&quot; 
Then the holy rabbi came out of the front of the apartment house of the nineteen year-old shiksa girl he was boinking, no doubt to 
go home to his wife with a plausible story about how he and J ehovah had been working a late shift at the synagogue. The girl 
followed him out to his car and they were still canoodling and nuzzling like he wasn&apos; t in his fifties. Y ou&apos; d think that with all that 
had been going on in the Northwest over the past couple of years, a Seattle rabbi of all people would understand by then that he 
didn&apos; t need to be out in public, but I guess there&apos; s no fool like an old fool, and that goes for J ews too. That lovely blond body must 
have been just too tempting. &quot;Target&apos;s up, mates,&quot; said Charlie, flipping open and checking his .357. &quot;Comrade Guillermo, would 
you care to do the honors in memory of absent friends?&quot; 

&quot; Va bene, padrone,&quot; Vitale replied. &quot; G razie.&quot; He was fairly new in the country and his English wasn&apos; t too good as yet. He was in 
the back with his double-barreled Sicilian shotgun that he called a lupara, already leaning over to the left rear passenger side and 
rolling down the window. &quot;I killa de slut too. She fuck-a de Jew.&quot; 

&quot;Knock yerself out, mate,&quot; said Charlie cheerfully. I slid on up beside the rabbi&apos;s Cadillac, Vitale cacked them both with one 
barrel of double- ought buck apiece, and for the hell of it I leaned my Webley out of the driver&apos;s side window with my left hand 
and popped a couple into their skulls as they flopped on the rainy tarmac of the parking lot I always liked little touches like that, 
not only killing the rabbi but letting his wife and family live with the fact that he&apos;d been killed in the arms of a blond Gentile 
whore. A mong her other deficiencies, G retl from the Shetl just couldn&apos; t measure up in the sack. 

Y es ma&apos; am, I know, I&apos; m talking dirty again and I&apos;m wandering. I really don&apos; t want to go back to that chair, but it&apos; s part of my 
story and I know I have to. 

There&apos; s no way I can describe the pain that anyone else could possible understand, so I won&apos; t try. I know a lot of Volunteers who 
underwent FBI interrogations were messed up in their heads forever, had nightmares about it until the day they died, and so on, 
but actually it&apos;s not a catastrophic memory for me. Just damned nasty. First off, Rooney was dead and I didn&apos;t really care any 
more whether or not I lived or died, so I wasn&apos; t as terrorized by it all as I might have been. I&apos;m sure somewhere in the back of my 
mind I still carried guilt over her death and the Federal torture must have seemed like just punishment to my subconscious. 
Secondly, I didn&apos;t expect anything else from those soulless beings in the suits and so ever since I was captured, I had been 
preparing myself mentally and spiritually for it at least insofar as anybody can. Finally, to be honest I don&apos; t remember all that 
much about it Down through the years my mind seems to have deleted most of that particular morning from my memory, and I 
recall it now like you might recall a particularly unpleasant trip to the dentist that took place a long time ago. The very worst part, 
of course, was when he shot the voltage to my balls, where the pain really does pass all human description, but as Goldberg 
chattily explained to me, he didn&apos;t want to do that too often because the agony could literally send me into cardiac arrest if 
overused. &quot;Dead Nazis can&apos;t suffer any more, and we can&apos;t have that now, can we, Shane me lad?&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Suffering is the 
wages of racism, me fine Irish bhoyo, oh yes it is, yes it is, yes it is! &quot; (He sang the last few words.) Fortunately, the male testicle is 
one of the toughest parts of the body despite its high sensitivity to pain. I eventually healed and I wasn&apos; t completely ruined for 
family life, as my eight children who were bom years later demonstrate. I didn&apos;t know that at the time, of course, and I actually 
hoped Goldberg would cut them off so they wouldn&apos;t hurt like that. He spaced out each torment with intervals of interrogation, 
sometimes the electric shock, sometimes the needles injecting that agonizer acid solution beneath my fingernails or into assorted 
fleshy parts. I still have some scars from the subcutaneous acid shots. Sometimes the iron collar of the garrotte choked me into 
unconsciousness as my lungs burned like a welder&apos; s torch for air. Then they&apos; d ease up and let me draw a few wheezing, desperate 
breaths and tighten it again. 

I think he only asked about four or five questions the whole time, always the same ones, droning on and on like some kind of 
invisible bee in my ear. &quot;Who is your commanding officer? Where is the .50-cahber ammunition kept in Lewis County? How 
many safe houses do you know about and where are they? Who besides yourself killed Lieutenant Leon Sorels? Who killed 
Supreme Courtjustice Samuel Rothstein?&quot; (They apparently had never figured that one out.) &quot;Where is John Corbett Morgan?&quot; 
On and on and on. I lost control of my body and emptied my bowels and my bladder very early on in the proceedings, which they 
all ignored, and my flesh around the attached electrodes began to char and smoke and sizzle, so after a while the place smelled like 
a weenie roast in a toilet as I burned alive in my own shit. In answer to every question I simply screamed out the senseless mantra 
&quot;Big beef bones for our dog!&quot; whereupon Goldberg touched a toggle switch and fried my fingertips or my spine or toes or my or 
my nose or my nuts again, or he gave a signal and one of the guards tightened the collar again, or the bitch stepped forward and 
gave me a shallow muscle injection of the acid again once she ran out of fingernails. 

How did I get through it without breaking? Well, the mantra about the beef bones helped. Charlie was right. When you&apos; re in pain 
you can convince yourself of irrational things, and I convinced myself that this nonsensical phrase was in fact the answer to all of 
G oldberg&apos; s questions and if I just kept shouting it long enough and loud enough he would finally understand and stop torturing 

A Distant Thunder 123 



me. I know that sounds absurd, but like I said, when a monster is toasting your balls with electric shock you don&apos;t think too 
clearly. It also helped that about halfway through I realized that Goldberg wasn&apos;t really interested in anything I had to say and he 
was just torturing me for the enjoyment of it, and somewhere in my increasingly jumbled mind I understood that nothing I could 
say would stop him from doing it He was enjoying himself too much. I heard him giggle. 

And you know, I think that was the first time I knew for absolute certain in my heart that the NVA had won. Because the 
Americans were out of ideas. They were about to lose everything, lose part of their precious United States itself, and this was all 
they could think of to do about it. They should have sent a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln or at least a General Grant 
to deal with us. Instead they sent a sick little Jew in a suit who from what I could hear was probably sitting behind that table 
masturbating while he tortured another man&apos;s sexual organs and body. This is the mark of the greatest nation in the world? Horse 
shit. The United States was a weak and senile and crumbling empire run by criminals and degenerates and cowards. I had the 
living proof of it every time Goldberg flicked that switch. 

They kept shooting water into my mouth from a sports bottle to make sure I would be able to speak if and when I decided to do so, 
and finally I did. &quot;You&apos;re going to die, Goldberg,&quot; I croaked in an attempt to laugh. &quot;We are going to beat you bloody and send 
every one of you A murrican cowards running out of the Northwest like little sissies crying for your mamas, and my comrades are 
going to find you and bum you alive, crisp as the ovens in Auschwitz should have done if they&apos; d ever existed. We owe you kikes a 
Holocaust and you&apos; re going to get one!&quot; Goldberg screamed in rage and hit the switch again and I blacked out. 
I have no idea how long the session lasted. Probably a lot shorter than it seemed, because the human body can take only so much 
punishment, and Goldberg intended to make a meal out of me. I wish I could say that I bit the ear off the dyke when they finally 
unstrapped me and pulled me out of the chair, but I was too weak and disoriented to do anything except dry-heave and moan. &quot;See 
you tomorrow, Shane, me lad,&quot; babbled Goldberg dementedly. &quot;I think tomorrow we&apos;ll start with the dentists&apos; drills. 
Zzzzweeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot; as he made a noise imitating a drill. Even as crushed as I was, my heart leaped in fear. I&apos;d put on a brave 
show today, but I knew the dentist&apos; s drill would be it I&apos; d break. I would scream for mercy from a Jew. I would tell whatever lie he 
wanted me to tell, accuse whoever he wanted me to accuse, reveal Rooney and my greatest and most intimate secrets if only he&apos; d 
keep that drill away from my teeth. I lay in my cell in agony and just tried to shut it all down in my mind. I prayed for death, and I 
would have tried to kill myself but I couldn&apos; t even move off my pallet in my cell. 

But once again, either the luck of the Irish or the hand of G od intervened. W as it some kind of weird karmic synchro nicity? D id 
God hear what I&apos; d threatened the son of a bitch with and answer my prayer? However it came about. Special Agent Bruce 
Goldberg never got the pleasure of seeing me crack under his dentist s drill, because he never returned to that place to continue 
torturing me. What goes around does indeed come around, and by some cosmic coincidence, that night in his affluent suburban 
home, it came around for the little Jew Goldberg as it had come around for big Jew Rothstein. Goldberg and his family lived in a 
special &quot;gated community,&quot; a kind of fortified compound that Federal employees in the Northwest were given as married quarters, 
although by then it should have been clear that nowhere was safe and I can only conclude that Z G &apos; s incredible arrogance tripped 
them up again. Someone was able to breach the security, and G oldberg and his family were executed by the Northwest Volunteer 
Army that night, the Jew himself being burned alive by the necklace, the gasoline- soaked tire that Third World negroid savages 
had used with such glee for generations. I later learned that this mission had been carried out by a hand-picked group of 
Volunteers led by a man who later became President of the Repubhc, a man whose wife Goldberg had murdered in prison. More 
synchro nicity? 

I&apos;ve never yet figured out whether there is a God, ma&apos;am, and I guess I&apos;ll be finding out soon, but the signs are encouraging. 
Because in my lifetime at least, there&apos; s been a little justice, and where there&apos; s smoke there&apos; s fire. 

They left me alone after that which might have had something to do with my threats against Goldberg and the quick vindication 
thereof. They might have become convinced that I had some secret way of communicating with the Volunteers and they didn&apos;t 
want to risk ending up like Brucie. So I got off with only one Federal torture session, which by NVA standards was easy time 
indeed. The days went by, day in and day out, week in and week out I had no way to tell time in that place where there was no 
darkness. At first I didn&apos;t notice and was glad only of being left alone in order to let my wounds heal. I must have suffered some 
kind of tissue damage that led to a fever, because I have some memory of white- coated medics standing over my mattress in the 
cell and injecting me with something and swabbing something on the bums from the electrodes and the acid. Then it was only 
endless sameness and boredom until I probably half insane from sensory and mental deprivation. I know now that a year passed. 

The final year of the revolution. 

* * * 

The first inkling I got that things were changing was that the food seemed to improve slightly. Alongside the Styrofoam plate of 
crap I began to see things like fruit on my plastic tray, peeled orange segments, an apple, a peach. I knew that these things might 
have been injected with dmgs, but by then I was so starving for some kind of variety in my diet that I simply didn&apos; t care anymore. 
I examined tiie fmit carefully for needle marks, and when I was unable to find any obvious signs of tampering I went ahead and 
ate it, nor did I seem to suffer from any ill effects. I began to get plates with actual meals on them— a tin pannikin of honest to 
G od hot beef stew even if it was out of a can, some hamburger that was recognizable as hamburger, tuna salad with dill pickles 
and some vegetables, and to go with the bread all of a sudden there were little segments of butter or margarine, and after a few 
more weeks even little restaurant packets of jam. Along with the spork they also gave us a little wooden spatula type thing, part 
knife and part spoon, that we could use to spread the butter on the bread. One meal had a small half- pint plastic bottle of spring 
water with a screw-on cap, and I decided to risk keeping the bottle when I put the tray back on the little shelf in the door. The tray 

A Distant Thunder 124 



disappeared and there was no subsequent beating, and thereafter I could fill the bottle from the sink and actually drink from 
something besides my cupped hand. Little things like that are like gold in prison; I prized that plastic bottle more than any golden 
goblet. 

Then one day the little slot in my door clattered, and it wasn&apos;t a food tray that appeared on the shelf, but a book! A paperback 
Louis L &apos; A mour W estem, which I leaped on and devoured in less than two hours. W hen I gave back my tray the next time I put the 
book on it, and when it was collected I said to whoever was outside like Oliver Twist, &quot;Please, sir, may I have some more?&quot; A few 
hours later, by my reckoning, another paperback dropped into the slot This time it was a much larger one, a Sweet Savage about a 
maiden who is abducted by a dark prince (as in black hair) and carried off on his charger to his castle where he rips her bodice and 
forces her into 101 Levantine deviations but with truly mighty and gentle Byronic passion, etc., etc. God, it was drivel! But 
compared to simply doing pushups and staring at the walls for twenty-three hours every day that was manna from Heaven and I 
devoured it down to the last hackwork sentence. When I was done I put it on my food tray and when the slot opened to take it, 
&quot;Look, I know you&apos; re trying to get me to rat and I won&apos;t do that, but I really do appreciate the books. As long as you&apos; re trying to 
bribe me with literature, any chance of some of the good old stuff, Dickens or Trollope or maybe even some Booth Tarkington?&quot; 
Well, whoever it was had a sense of humor. A few hours later the slot rattled and I was looking at a paperback copy of Moby D ick. 
&quot;Thanks! &quot; I yelled through the slot. &quot;If you&apos; 11 tell me who you are I&apos; 11 try to get the boys to go easy on you when the time comes! &quot; 
I never got a response, but for days after that I stood on the decks of the Pequod and chased the great white whale. After that there 
was all kinds of great stuff, Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, and even a battered library copy from somewhere of Tarkington&apos;s 
Seventeen. Let me tell you, if ever you need to refresh your sense of the absurd, try sitting on the floor next to a stainless steel 
toilet in a featureless ZOG prison cell with only white light and the air conditioning for sensory stimulation, and reading about the 
adventures of Silly Bill Baxter and Flopit and big lummox George Crooper overeating and puking his guts out at a circa-1914 
teenagers&apos; picnic. I had noticed by this time that not only were they being nice to me but Bruce Goldberg hadn&apos;t dragged me back 
downstairs for another session with the dentists&apos; drills, but I had no way of knowing why. I figured that this was some kind of 
change in Federal policy and I would eventually be approached with some kind of attempt to flip me and turn me into an informer. 
But it never happened. 

Then one day the cell door opened, the guards came in and slapped the manacles and belly bands on me in the usual manner, and I 
was marched out into the corridor. But this time was different. This time all the cell doors up and down the corridor were open and 
other manacled prisoners in the orange jumpsuits were being pulled down the hall by pairs of guards. We shuffled down endless 
corridors and all of a sudden we went through a door and we were outside. It was night, the first time I had actually seen the stars 
overhead in God alone knew how long. Around me in long lines were my fellow prisoners dressed in Gulag orange, mostly men 
but a few women as well, maybe fifty of us. There were two barred prison buses pulled up in the central yard of the prison, and the 
guards were herding us onto the buses. I was slapped down into a seat next to a big man I&apos;d never seen before, maybe forty years 
old, a stubbled face. The guard hooked my wrist cuffs onto a staple on the seat so my hands were down between my legs, and 
walked down the aisle. For the first time I was alone with a fellow prisoner. I looked at him. &quot;What the hell?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;They&apos;re probably going to take us off someplace nice and isolated, whack us all out, and bury us in the woods&quot; said the 
Volunteer grimly. &quot;Bob Donner, B Company, Number Two Spokane Brigade. And you, comrade?&quot; 

&quot;Shane Ryan, E Company, South Sound Brigade,&quot; I said. &quot;How long have you been in here? Do you know what month and year it 
is?&quot; 

&quot;I have no idea on either question.&quot; 

I leaned forward. &quot;How about you, comrade?&quot; I askedthemiddle-aged woman in the seat front of me. &quot;What unit? How long have 
you been here in Uncle Slime&apos; s pleasure palace? Can you tell me what&apos; s been going on with the war?&quot; 
&quot;Sergeant Martha Price, quartermaster for the Seattle East Side Brigade. Christ, I don&apos; t know, it seems so long ago,&quot; she 
whispered. &quot;They got me up in North Bend, just after Jock Graham&apos; s Number Two Brigade boys blew the 520 bridge over the 
Lake Union.&quot; 

&quot;That was after my time,&quot; I said with a delighted chuckle. &quot;Bet that fucked up Seattle like a Chinese fire drill!&quot; 
&quot;Quiet back there!&quot; bellowed a voice from the front of the bus. But none of the guards came back to punish us. 
&quot;No beating,&quot; whispered the woman dryly. &quot;Not a good sign.&quot; 

&quot;They&apos; re going to kill us,&quot; muttered Donner. &quot;They may just drive the damned buses into the Sound and let us sink, but if they 
don&apos; t, we need to work out a plan to rush them when they take us off when we get wherever we&apos; re going. Let&apos; s at least die 
fighting.&quot; Then two more guards came to the back of the bus and worked their way forward, and slapped strips of masking tape 
over the mouths of all the prisoners. With our hands pinned down between our legs we couldn&apos; t lean down far enough to tear the 
tape off. The buses started up and we rolled out the gates into the darkness. I mean darkness; Auburn is a Seattle suburb and there 
were nowhere near as many lights on as there should have been, just a few isolated gleams here and there showing hints of 
buildings and streets. It was almost like some kind of medieval plague had settled over the city. It was a bit hard for me to follow 
where we were going, but then we got on the interstate for a few miles and I could tell we were going south and we were into 
Tacoma. Then Olympia, and we got off the interstate and rolled through very dark, very silent back streets and roads. Once off to 
my right I saw some low gleams on hangar- like buildings and a tower, and knew we were passing the Olympia airport. We were 
almost on top of the spot where we&apos; d taken down Burger King Rothstein all that endless time ago. I suddenly got some idea of 
what it must be like for Fatties and Feds, having to move through this darkness, knowing always that the NV A was out there 
waiting for them somewhere. 

A Distant Thunder 125 



I recognized where we were when we pulled into Millersylvania State Park at about dawn. We parked in a large clearing by a lake 
that glistened with the rising sun. Again without a word the guards went down the rows of the seats and uncuffed us, then hauled 
us all outside. We had neither the opportunity to plot any rush against our captors nor the opportunity to do so. We were stood in 
ranks and swiftly teams of guards came and unlocked our cuffs, cattle prods at the ready to zap any of us who tried to break bad. 
They took off the manacles, leaving us rubbing our wrists and ripping the tape from out mouths. We were looking around for the 
troops and the machine guns which we were convinced were going to cut us all down, but without a single word of explanation 
the guards climbed back into the buses, started the engines and drove away, leaving almost fifty Volunteers standing in a clearing 
wearing orange coveralls, looking at one another in puzzlement. Then we heard more engines coming and more buses pulled up 
into the clearing, accompanied by a truck filled in the back with armed men in a kind of khaki ensemble, and several Humvees 
with mounted machine guns. Federal military vehicles always had the brownish desert camouflage, inappropriate in the Northwest 
but a holdover from the days that the vehicles had been rolling across the Arabian or Iraqi desert. The truck and the Humvees had 
a rondel on their doors, a round insignia painted on their sides like the insignia you used to see on World War One French and 
British biplanes on the Western Front, only these rondels were blue, white, and green. Each bus had a kind of flagstaff welded to 
the driver^ s side and from the staff flew Tricolor flags. As we stared in amazement a man got out of one of the Humvees and came 
toward us. He was wearing a khaki shirt, green trousers, high boots and a billed green cap with the same Tricolor rondel on it. I 
didn&apos;t know it, but I was looking at the first uniformed NVA troops I had ever seen. A woman dressed in the same OD and khaki 
motif was walking by his side, only she wore a green skirt and had a pert little green beret with the rondel on her head with the 
green rondel emblem. It was a moment before I recognized them. Carter and China Wingfield. 
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; I asked, after hugging them both in wild amazement and stunned relief. 

&quot;Y our lot from Auburn was the first of the good faith prisoner releases,&quot; said Carter. &quot;I called in every damned favor I had on the 
A rmy C ouncil and I got them to insist that you be included in the first draft. &quot; 
&quot;Good faith prisoner release?&quot; I asked. &quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot; 

&quot;It means we&apos;ve won!&quot; said China, her brown eyes shining, her lovely face burning with joy. &quot;Shane, a couple of months ago the 
United States government made contact with GHQ, secretly, at first through the international Red Cross and then through the Irish 
representative to the UN, who&apos; s been acting as mediator. We&apos; re meeting with them down at Longview next week. They want to 
negotiate a settlement! We&apos;ve won!&quot; 
The accountants had finally surrendered. We had secured the existence of our people and a future for White children. 

A Warrior For The Working Day 

Tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day... 

Our gilt are all besmirch&apos; d with rainy marching in the painful field; 

There&apos;s not a piece of feather in our host, good argument, I hope, we will not fly. 

And time has worn us into slovenry. Butby the mass, our hearts are in the trim!

From: BertradaM. Schulter, Ph. D 

Dearjared: 

Thank you for the kind words and favorable assessment that you have given to the taped interviews I have conducted over the past 

several weeks with former NVA Volunteer Shane A. Ryan in Dundee, Washington, Northwest American Republic (Earth 

Homeland). I am glad you received them in good order; sometimes deep space transmission can still be a bit iffy. Although I agree 

that Mr. Ryan&apos;s language and some of his sexually oriented comments are in many places unsuitable for general publication and 

broadcast under the Territorial laws governing obscenity, he does indeed have a point when he says early during the sessions that 

in the time in his youth when the Republic was part of the United States, such negrified language was part of normal conversation. 

I have been assured by many of the wonderful people I have met here in the Republic that this is the case, and almost everyone 

remembers one or more foul-mouthed elderly relatives from that time who grew up listening to blacks all around them and so 

adopted the Ebonic speech patterns and dialect When it comes down to broadcast time, we do have bleepers we can use. 

I deeply regret to report that an old saying still holds true: man proposes and God disposes. I arrived at the Carter Ryan home in 

Dundee on the morning of August the 3 O&quot;&apos; and went out back to the trailer where old Mr. Shane lived and where we had been 

doing our stream of consciousness recounting of his life, only to discover that he had suffered a heart attack during the night. He 

had been found still breathing but in serious condition that ncming by his grandson George Lincoln Rockwell Ryan, and he had 

been taten to Providence Hospital, ironically the same hospital in which he had been bom ninety-one years previously. His 

children and grandchildren had repeatedly asted him to neve into a bedroom in one of their large homes of his choosing, where 

A Distant Thunder 126 



he would be more easily obsen^able and accessible if he had any problems, but Mr. Ryan always refused because he felt somehow 
that a trailer held symbolic significance to his life. Something to the effect that ZOG had made him trailer trash and so he would 
end his days in a trailer while laughing at them and treasuring the memory of the J ews he&apos; d whacked. Y es, that sounds like Shane, 
all right. 

So hen I was listening to Mr. Ryan ramble, I was sitting there in a battered, hundred-year old single wide mobile home, although 
very carefully and lovingly restored by the Ryan family for Shane with proper climate control and insulation and every 
convenience. G od, it&apos; s hard to believe human beings originally came from this place! How do they stand it? The air here is far too 
thick and moist; even with the air conditioning that Mr. Ryan so courteously cranked up for me to approximate Mars standards 
when he saw that I was uncomfortable, I felt half choked and drowned, and of course I am way, way too heavy on this planet My 
feet always hurt, and every night when I fall into bed I feel like I&apos;ve just done a hundred- mile run from the Rift to Landfall station 
and back, packing all the old outdoor respiration gear from our childhood on my back. 

I went to the hospital immediately. I had become friends with the family who appreciated what I was doing to record their father 
and grandfather&apos; s experiences. His middle-aged sons Carter and Red and Adam and all the others shook their heads in wonder 
when I played back tiie digitals for them. &quot;Jesus!&quot; Carter Ryan told me at one point, &quot;We never had any idea about any of this 
stuff! I mean, sure, when we were growing up we kids knew our father and mother were both Volunteers during the revolution, 
and once a year they put on their Independence medals and they went out to the Old Fighters&apos; reunion, and that they were usually 
designated drivers because Mom was a Christian and Pop didn&apos;t drink. But I never knew why Pop didn&apos;t drink. He never talked 
about his parents and I still don&apos;t think I even know their names. They never talked about the war much, although sometimes 
Mom or Pop would make some reference to Aunt Rooney or my grandmother Racine, and of course when I was young Pop sat me 
down and told me about Carter Wingfield, and the heroes of Mariana, Florida who died fighting for the Confederacy, and why I 
had to grow up and honor Carter&apos; s name that I bore and the whole Wingfield legacy. But we never knew any of the details. Dr. 
Schulter. I&apos; m still in a state of shock to learn that my father was married to Rooney once. I wonder why neither he nor Mom ever 
mentioned anything about that?&quot; 

I hazarded a guess from listening to Mr. Ryan. &quot;Y our father and your mother grew up in a time when things were very 
complicated,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Perhaps they thought that complication wasn&apos;t a good thing for children to grow up with, and by the 
time you were adults it was simply ancient history of no interest to anyone but themselves. Time does heal all wounds, eventually. 
Perhaps neither of them wanted to open that one. Or perhaps he simply thought it would have been disrespectful to China. But 
now you know, why don&apos;t you ask him?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe I will, once you&apos;re through,&quot; said Carter. &quot;We all think it&apos; s absolutely great you were able to persuade Pop to finally 
speak out. I agree with you, ma&apos; am. His story belongs to this whole nation and it&apos; s something that shouldn&apos; t be lost. &quot; So I was 
allowed into Mr. Ryan&apos;s hospital room, and I had the sad honor and painful privilege of being present about noon when his son 
Carter slipped the old .455 Webley revolver into his father&apos; s still hand and closed his fingers around the butt. The old man 
breathed his last a few minutes later. &quot;NVA tradition,&quot; Carter explained to me as his father had done before. &quot;A Northwest 
Volunteer dies with a gun in his hand.&quot; Although I had only known him for a short time, I wept with the family. Shane Ryan was 
the last generally recognized NVA veteran in Lewis County, Washington. (I think there are about seventy or eighty officially 
acknowledged NVA Old Fighters left still in the Northwest Republic, all extremely elderly and in poor health, of course.) The 
Rebel County had lost its last Jerry Reb, and our Folk lost something very precious from our past. I thank God I was able to get 
most of it onto digital and preserve it forever, and even more proud that the original tabs will be held at our own university 
archives on Mars. 

Y et all the while Shane spoke, despite his crude expletives and long digressions into economics and everything else, I understood 
that I owed an immense debt to this cranky, half- senile, foul-mouthed old man, who admitted to at least a dozen murders. I owed 
him my very existence, and the existence of my beloved children. Because had he and the men and women of his generation not 
done what they did, not only would there be no white people on Mars, there would be no people on Mars, and there would be no 
white people anywhere. Period. End of story. There would be only this one world and it would be nothing but mud. 
Thirty-five Mars years ago, seventy earth years, an incredible and inexplicable miracle occurred. In this one small comer of the 
Earth, a small band of white men and women suddenly awoke from a poisoned sleep and found within themselves the courage to 
secure the existence of their people and a future for white children. All it took was a sword and some guts behind it, as Shane 
would have said. 

Now because of what they did, you and I and all three hundred thousand of us on Mars, and all two hundred million of us in the 
Homeland on our home world, and the fifty thousand of us on Luna, and the pioneers on Ganymede and the men and women 
whom I havejustheard have finally made a live landing onVenus... we&apos;re alive! And if our birthrates are anything to goby, the 
A ryan shall never perish from the face of the cosmos. The J ews still scheme and sometimes they hurt us, hurt us badly, but they&apos; 11 
never get us all now, because at least a few of us have escaped to other worlds. All because of this old coot who sat in front of me 
leaning on his cane and droning on with his memories of things incredibly wonderful and unspeakably horrible. 
We don&apos; t have much history yet on Mars, and with any luck we will never will have much of the kind that Shane Ryan described. 
W ith G od&apos; s help and old man Shane&apos; s we&apos; ve left most of the bad behind us. W e&apos; re going to find out what it&apos; s like to have a whole 
world to ourselves, just white people with no Jews, and so far it&apos;s shaping up pretty darned wonderful. But what we have, we will 
have because a young woodchuck kid named Shane Ryan and a few others sat in cars on dark, wet Northwest nights on rainy 
streets, waiting for someone to step out and be shot down on the asphalt Or waiting for something to go boom. Or waiting to beat 

A Distant Thunder 127 



another human being with clubs. Waiting to do something terrible so that something good might come for people and children 

they never would see. People like you and me, Jared. 

Now I know why I came to the vocation of history. The connection must be maintained. The generations of the future must know 

these things, and thanks to technology we don&apos;t have to rely on words inked on parchment with quills. We can see and we can 

hear. A hundred generations on Mars and on Earth as well will hear Shane Ryan&apos;s words now. He will speak to the future he gave 

his youth for. I&apos; m not sure about this, but in a very strange and magnificent and sad and glorious way, I think I saw our father die 

in that hospital room, Jared. Because Shane Ryan and his comrades made me, and you. They made our world possible, in every 

sense of the word. They made us, Jared. 

Enough. I&apos; m getting maudlin. I&apos; m going to Shane&apos; s funeral tomorrow and then my grant is up and it&apos; s off to Centralia Spaceport 

and the shuttle, then a four months&apos; voyage through the black and I will see old Dusty Red looming up in the vision screen, and 

then you and I will stand together on the mezzanine of the Great Dome and watch Phobos and Deimos race over our heads, and 

since I&apos;m not a teetotaller like old man Ryan I might even be persuaded to share a bottle of hydroponic scuppemong champagne 

with you. 

A nd if you ask me yet again, who knows? I might even marry you. 

Yours, 

Bertie 

* * * 

Later - Just got back from the funeral, and I need to start packing for the spaceport. How odd to know that I will almost certainly 
never see Earth again, the ancestral home of our race. Well, we have the future to look to now. 

There were no more NV A veterans left to provide the firing party for old man Ryan&apos; s funeral, so the SS did the honors. He was 
buried with the Tricolor on his coffin, and I was rather surprised to see that there was a whole sort of Wingfield family plot in the 
V eterans&apos; C emetery . T hey were all there to keep him company, C arter and Racine and J ohn Hunt and J ohn B ell and A dam and a 
memorial to Leah whose remains were never found, and the assorted wives and children including Shane&apos;s son in the 
Kriegsmarine who went down on the Corvallis. Shane was buried between the two sisters he had married, China on the one side 
and Rooney on the other. On his stone were chiseled the words that summed up the man&apos; s life. Well, that&apos; s what epitaphs are 
supposed to do, right? 

Shane Alan Ryan - Northwest Volunteer. 
He didn&apos;t walk away.
