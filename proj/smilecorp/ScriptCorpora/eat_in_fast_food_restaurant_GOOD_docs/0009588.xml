 I wish I was on the jury on this one: 

 Story and video can be found here: http://newyork.cbslocal.c...-at-manhattan-mcdonalds/ 
 

 NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A fight over an order at a Manhattan McDonald’s leads to complete chaos and it was all caught on tape.

The video contains images and audio of a graphic nature.

Sources tell CBS 2’s Chris Wragge the stunning incident featured a 
cashier with a criminal past violently beating two female customers 
after they appear to provoke him by slapping him and then hopping the 
counter.

It was a horrific scene to watch. The cashier disappears into the 
back of the fast-food restaurant on West Fourth Street in Greenwich 
Village before returning with a metal rod he then used viciously on the 
two customers.

The gruesome act of violence early Thursday morning escalated after 
the customers argued and yelled obscenities at the cashier when he 
questioned a $50 bill they gave him.
 
One of the female customers then slapped the cashier. A woman is then
 seen jumping over the counter, while the other woman goes behind the 
register. They are then savagely attacked.

Other customers watched in horror as other McDonald’s workers tried unsuccessfully to stop the violence.
One female customer had a fractured skull that required surgery and a broken arm. The other has a deep laceration
Rayon McIntosh, 31, was arrested and charged with two counts of 
felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon. McIntosh served more
 than a decade in prison after shooting and killing a high school 
classmate in 2000. He was being held on $40,000 bail.

The female customers were reportedly charged with menacing, disorderly conduct and trespassing.

Don&apos;t discount the fact that McDonald&apos;s itself was responsible of the premature death of countless American citizens, by overweight...

All of this happen by their fault, what a guy is suppose to do when someone goes where he is not supposed to? Waiting to be beaten... Same kind of thing happen to me when I was working in a store and even if the guy leave the place bleeding a lot my boss never seen me as responsible for any of this. In fact the costumer was more deeply in trouble that I was because of this.

They check to see if you speak English. If not, McDonald&apos;s will hire you on the spot!

When you where work in a customer servant position, you&apos;re suppose to take the abuse, regardless... besides, the guy had a criminal record. That means he has no rights. In the land fo the free, any transgression in your past makes you fair game. As Hillary Clinton put it:

 United States Citizenship is a privalge, not a right!

Verbal abuse is acceptable to a certain point. I&apos;ve never hesitate to tell a client to go @++% himself when my limit was reach and never got any consequences because of that.
Physical abuse certainly not, the second someone make a threatening physical movement you have to defend yourself. it&apos;s as easy as that. It was quite clear at my work that it was perfectly fine to strike if you were physically threaten.

Thank god I don&apos;t leave in the US, as it seems it&apos;s perfectly normal to be beaten or kill when a client (to not say stupid drunk who had nothing to do in a store in the first place) jump at you

First of all, I was being a bit  facetious , considering I have dedicated my whole life to the customer servitude profession.

Second, doesn&apos;t matter in corporate America who started it. As a customer servant represenitive, the appropriate response would have been to remove himself from the situation and call security and/or 911. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s right. But that&apos;s what would have been expected from corporate standards. I worked for HECHTS back in 1996 during the Christmas season (which ruined Christmass for me when I saw it actually bring out the worst in people, not the best) and employee was attacked by a customer and he defended himself. Not only was he terminated, but HECHTS was sued, settled out of court, then turned around and sued the former employee for reimbursement.

When I worked for Tower records, a customer threatened to rip the nose ring out of one of my supervisor&apos;s face over lawn tickets he purchased that he tried to exchange for stadium seats when he found out was going to rain, even though the sign said all sales are final. The guy ranted and raved, left the store and came back waving a hammer. Nothing was done except he exchanged the tickets.

Why didn&apos;t you just call the cops?

 I&apos;m sure lawyers have attached themselves to those two, smelling a nice lawsuit against McDonald&apos;s. And there will be a nice settlement, unfortunately. Regarding the guy, he committed a crime and did his time, so he should be able to work at any place that can hire him. He probably gave a few more whacks defending himself than warranted, but, hey, those two shouldn&apos;t have rushed his area, threatening him with violence.

We were getting ready to, but the guy never actually threatened with the hammer, he justy came back in waving it around and so we went ahead and exchanged the tickets and absorbed the costs to get him out of the store. And then the guy filed a complaint with corporate to boot on the poor/rude customer service he recieved.

You&apos;d have only needed to have been put in reasonable fear by the hammer in order for him to have been charged with assault.

Then it becomes a question of vicarious liability.

It was 10 years ago. And TOWER is out of buisness now. All water under the bridge. And at the time they tended to do selective enforcement. If someone looked like a direlict and/or homeless who came into the store, they tended to call the cops and have us lie to get the person banned from the store and possibly even arrsted if they stood up for themselve. If someone was a yuppie (in this case a young jock/yuppie) we tended to put up with the abuse, unless actual violence occured or theft was involved. When it came to theft, there was zero tolerence. When it came to abuse, depended where the person fit on the social economical ladder on where we drew the line.
