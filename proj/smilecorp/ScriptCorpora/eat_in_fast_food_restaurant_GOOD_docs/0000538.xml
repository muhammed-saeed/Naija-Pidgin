 ★★★★★ Olive Garden is better then you can possibly imagine. 
 Jess F. 5 Olive Garden 
 
As someone who lives in New York City I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I frequent many establishments in this area and would like them to be less crowded, so heading over to the Olive Garden for a&quot;Never Ending Pasta Bowl&quot;that will take you back to that time when you were in Florence eating a&quot;Never Ending Pasta Bowl&quot;as it is a famous Tuscan delicacy (as is the&quot;Tuscan Burger&quot;and Bourbon.) Enjoy!

While in New York City we went to this Olive Garden. It is located right in Times Square. We had a great meal with the same service! We did have to wait a while to be seated, but we found a table in the bar area and got some drinks. This Olive Garden gets extremely busy because of it&apos;s location.

 ★★★★☆ Good food, long wait!!! 
 Chimera B. | Insider Expert
| Rank: 3,455 4 Olive Garden 
 
I love Olive Garden, but I hardly ever go here because there is ALWAYS a long wait. I mean, the wait can sometimes be up to 2 hours on a weekend. When the weather is nice, you can walk around times square while you wait, but in the winter, its just not worth it to wait in the small bar area for your table. BUT if you do get a seat, the food is always excellent. I love their Italian Margarita with a shot of Amaretto and the lobster and crab stuffed Raviolli. They try to get u in and out of here fast since it stays crowded, but the staff is usually pretty nice.

 ★☆☆☆☆ Why Go To Fake Chain Italian in NYC? 
by cityneversleeps at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 March 11, 2012 
I don&apos;t know why I even agreed to go to this fake/chain imitation Italian food joint when there are so many amazing, authentic Italian restaurants in the city.

A friend from out of town insisted on meeting me here, so I gave in. I don&apos;t think they can even spell Pasta at the Olive. I took my buddy for some Ray&apos;s pizza later and he got my point.


 ★★★★☆ Excellent food choices!!

Excellent food choices!!


 ★★★★★ Love their bread! 
by ejay1314 at Citysearch 5 Olive Garden 
 December 25, 2011 
I wanted to try it since forever, and when I did, it was AWESOME. They&apos;re so nice and I just love their bread. When I went they had the pasta bowl, where you could get as many pastas for, if I remember, 10~20? It was great, unfortunately, so fulling!
The place was busy and full. It&apos;s definitely a place someone should try!


 ★☆☆☆☆ WORST OLIVE GARDEN EVER! 
by TRAVELIN GIRL at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 October 01, 2011 
During my 1st visit to NYC I dined at Olive Garden because it was late and I needed something to eat. There was a 45 minute wait which was expected given the area.

This Olive Garden looked worn and dark.

I was seated at a 2 both table where the seats were so worn that my bottom sunk into the middle - yuck!

Again, I was starving so I stayed. My meal was just ok - nothing special.

The waitress, Brittany G was not friendly or warm - she was cold and didn&apos;t crack a smile.

The 18% gratuity was included in the bill. Make sure you review your bill BEFORE leaving a tip unless you will leave a double tip.

This was the worst Olive Garden I have ever dined at - Never again!


 ★☆☆☆☆ Do not go there under any circumstances! 
by wertgohen at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 August 04, 2010 
Never never never
The whole family went to eat at the restaurant on Wednesday night. 28/07/2010
We passed there a very difficult experience
Our waitress was a girl named Lindzy, extremely impatient, rude and blunt.
She caused us great distress and even insulted us very much.
What was the reason? One of us dared to taste the other&apos;s &quot;refilled&quot; salad.
She verbally attacked us and treated us as thieves. I cannot believe administration scolded her for this.
We definitely have complained about it immediately.
For emphasis, we all ordered appetizers and main dishes at full price.
Have to teach them a lesson that the customer is first of all a human being.
I really suggest staying out of this place.
Do not go there under any circumstances!
Thank you.


 ★★★★☆ Good experience!

Olive garden in times square is a great place to go for a good meal. The chicken parm. is my dish of choice with a few glasses of wine.the service is good for a fast food restaurant.


 ★☆☆☆☆ Olive Garden @ Times Square 
by tee a at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 May 18, 2010 
I didn&apos;t have high hopes for this. I mean, their commercials looked amazing but it&apos;s a chain Italian restaurant--awesome if it&apos;s good, if it&apos;s not, what the hey. I&apos;ve always been curious about Olive Garden, though, so I decided to give it a try.

My family and I ordered the appetizer platter, choosing calamari, fried mozzarella, and stuffed mushrooms--those were good. I could&apos;ve eaten just those, dunking happily away in the sour cream sauce or the marinara sauce and with an occasional bite from the soft and warm breadsticks. The salad was nothing special, something you can easily whip in your kitchen.

Then my eggplant parmigiana came and first let me just say that I have a thing for eggplant--anything eggplant i love. So, since the appetizers were good, I began to think that the entree would be even better.

Plating was horirble--it&apos;s as if they slapped the fried eggplant on the plate, then dumped the spaghetti and the marinara on the side.

The spaghetti was mushy and the sauce was too sweet for my taste. The fried eggplant tasted like it was one of those ready-to-fry, breaded frozen eggplants and was so bland I felt like dousing it with hot sauce. I settled for several spoonfuls of grated parmesan cheese (good it was fresh and not the can kind).

Maybe it&apos;s just me, since I&apos;m used to dining at non-chain Italian restaurants and I&apos;ve had amazing Italian dishes since I was a kid. Suffice to say, I probably won&apos;t be coming back to Olive Garden anytime soon. If I do come back, I&apos;ll stick with the appetizer platter.

Pros: the breadsticks and the sampler appetizer platter were good.

Cons: my eggplant parmigiana was not


 ★★★★★ Excellent

Ths place actually makes me starving. Funny how I&apos;m eating pasta now from Olive Gardens leftovers that I wrapped up. Great Italian style food. A taste of Italy with italian style music and instruments. Service is slow. Long wait and long lines are a strong possability. Remember it may take you forever to get the check. It get sbusy for the wators/waitresses. Though the employees are very nice and so is this manager in this particular chain.

Pros: Delicious thinking of this place makes me hungry

Cons: Crowds, slow service, prices, bad liqours

Since your rest. has cancelled ads. for the Letterman&apos;s show I will find an Olive Garden and eat there frequently. Good going! I like your company values.


 ★★★★☆ great

this place is the best it is clean and nicely decorated. and most importantly they have the best food in town you must try if you are in lakeside A+ for customer service as well


 ★★★★☆ One of my favorite food chain restaurants 
by kuk0lka at Citysearch 4 Olive Garden 
 November 26, 2008 
I have been to Olive Garden twice and am definitely planning to return. The seating is quite prompt on busy nights considering the size of the restaurant. So what that the food is not &apos;authentically Italian&apos;? Who cares? People go to restaurants because they want to enjoy the atmosphere and the ambiance of the place. That is why I go to Olive Garden. The food is not over the top, but it&apos;s good; the drinks include all my favorite cocktails. The service is quick and very professional. Last time my boyfriend and I went there, we got charged for a glass of wine instead of the bottle we got! That will definitely make me come back!

Pros: excellent service, great ambiance, quick seating


 ★★★☆☆ Not Real Italian 
by aerosync504 at Citysearch 3 Olive Garden 
 November 20, 2008 
Too garlicy. I smelt it on me for the rest of the day. It was very busy during lunch time. We sat down quickly but the waitress had a lot of other tables. Not a huge fan. If you think this is good italian food you&apos;ve obviously haven&apos;t tasted authentic italian food.

Pros: Sat quickly

Cons: Too much garlic!


 ★★☆☆☆ Horrible Experience...... 
by vodkalima at Citysearch 2 Olive Garden 
 August 27, 2007 
After a long wait of about 45 min. I was about to be seated, I had my shopping bags on the chair but we were missing 2 friends that went to the bathromm while waiting, The hostess for some reason thoought that we were only 2 and when I told her she had the nerve to tell me that she could not seat us until everyone was there? I told her that my friends were in the bathroom and she didn&apos;t care and didn&apos;t give us the table until they were there. I&apos;ve to some Olive Gardens in NJ, and I loved them but here it seems that the food was a little below on the other places.... I loved the waiter but never go back to this location.....

Pros: Rude Hostess. not the right food

Cons: Good Value


 ★☆☆☆☆ Poor excuse for Italian food 
by georgiawith at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 August 11, 2007 
Ohhhhhh my, I cannot believe that New Yorkers actually like the Olive Garden. What has gotten into you guys??? They have the worst food ever -- bland as can be. Try any place in Little Italy for Italian food. If you really think that Olive Garden has Italian food -- you have been living in a cave!!

Pros: nothing

Cons: bland food that is NOT Italian


 ★★★★☆ NOW THAT&apos;S ITALIAN! 
by booch5151 at Citysearch 4 Olive Garden 
 October 02, 2006 
Everytime my Uncle Mario comes to NY from Sicily, I bring him to the Olive Garden. He said that the Garlic Cheesy Bread and Never-Ending Pasta Bowl remind him of the old country. Try the Veal Francese; it&apos;s the best you&apos;ll have on this side of the Mediterranean! FORZA ITALIA!

Pros: Parmigian Cheese, Lou the Bartender

Cons: Nothing


 ★☆☆☆☆ Do not even go there!! 
by genine810 at Citysearch 1 Olive Garden 
 August 01, 2006 
I honestly can not believe that people eat at Olive Garden when they are a few short blocks away from Resturant Row in midtown. I made the mistake of being dragged there and I was so disappointed, there is nothing authentic about the food. I am not sure where there other reviews live but this is coming from a native New Yorker - go to Little Italy - you wont be disappointed.

Pros: Location

Cons: Food is horrible


 ★★★★★ Great food, low prices! 
by WizardCrab715 at Citysearch 5 Olive Garden 
 June 21, 2003 
I have taken my girlfriend four times to the Olive Garden in Times Square, New York, NY. Considering the quality of the food and service and its location, you would expect to pay much more. Enjoy a great Italian meal with your significant other for $50 or less. Highly recommended!

Pros: Good service, Inexpensive


 ★★★★★ Good Food ! 
by shinobuny at Citysearch 5 Olive Garden 
 January 03, 2003 
Everytime we go there, it is very crowded. (Of course, we had to wait long time because it is crowded. If you complain about waiting, go somewhere else.) My husband and I love their food there. Pasta is very good. We also love the peach tea. You get free refills. Big value size food. I&apos;ve been to Carmines few times, and Olive Garden few times. I like Olive Garden better now. They include 15% tip because many tourists who doesn&apos;t know about tip go there. The service is better than most of the restaurants in the city.

Pros: Really good pasta, Good Value

Cons: Bit Expensive


 ★★★☆☆ Their food is ok, service is better. 
by goodtaster at Citysearch 3 Olive Garden 
 November 20, 2002 
I went to the Olive Garden for the first time a few months ago, and the food was ok. The entree soup was phenomenal, but the food was just ok. I would have paid the price that I paid just for the entree soup by itself. But again, the food was just ok. Service was another thing. Service was also good, considering that the place was crowded, the server served us properly, and offered us more soup...again, the main plate was just ok. 150 words max...oops...too little space!

Pros: inexpensive, good service, good soup

Cons: bad parking, bad main plate, little privacy


 ★★☆☆☆ Tipping on Take-Out Food 
by katcrifer at Citysearch 2 Olive Garden 
 October 22, 2002 
Apparently a norm at Olive Garden to be charged a dining-in surcharge and a tip when ordering on take-out food. Also the norm to include the tip of 15% on the bill total. Only at Olive Garden....

Pros: free and unlimited, breadsticks/salad

Cons: very loud


 ★★★★☆ amazing 
by lanarx at Citysearch 4 Olive Garden

The food is amazingly deliscious and fresh and the views of the city are breathtaking!!
A must go especially if you are in Times square

Great food, service and setting! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy authentic Italian food at amazingly resonable prices (considering the location). Check it out!
