Traditional Indians massacre Valentine&apos;s Day

February 11 2003 at 10:36am

 
Mumbai - Hindu nationalist groups that have burned greeting cards, trashed gift shops and harassed hand-holding couples to protest Valentine&apos;s Day in previous years are getting ready to make their point again this week.

&quot;We are against celebrating Valentine&apos;s Day,&quot; senior Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray told reporters this week.

&quot;It is nothing but a Western onslaught on India&apos;s culture to attract youth for commercial purposes.&quot;

Protests by Hindu nationalist parties have turned increasingly violent in recent years, with groups like the Shiv Sena forcing shop owners to get rid of Valentine&apos;s Day cards and blocking access to gift shops.

The Shiv Sena, part of the coalition government of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has repeatedly called for a ban on Valentine&apos;s Day celebrations.

Despite all that, Valentine&apos;s Day is gaining popularity each year in towns across India. Hotels and restaurants advertise special parties, and cardboard cupid cutouts decorate shop windows.

Couples buy each other gifts ranging from gold jewelry to heart-shaped chocolates. Newspapers and Internet sites list personal messages and interview famous movie stars about their latest loves.

&quot;These protests don&apos;t really make a difference. Couples still celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day. It is just sad for poor shop owners who are the unlucky targets,&quot; said Manish Surve, who stocks Valentine&apos;s Day cards in his roadside bookshop in suburban Bombay.

Although traditional Indian society frowns on public displays of affection between the sexes, couples hold hands and cuddle in restaurants and parks in big cities such as Bombay. Indian movies show couples embracing in titillating dance numbers.

But Shiv Sena, one of several groups that want India to be a Hindu nation, rather than a secular, multi-religious one, foreign culture is corrupting young Indian minds and spreading Western holidays and traditions through television and movies.

Police in Bombay have been ordered &quot;to keep a watch particularly near big card shops,&quot; said Inspector Ramesh Salve.

Last year Shiv Sena activists held bonfires of Valentine cards and stood outside large Mumbai stores warning customers not to buy them.

In India&apos;s capital, New Delhi, Hindu nationalist groups marched to Parliament and burnt Valentine&apos;s Day cards. Activists of the Bajrang Dal, a right-wing Hindu group that is not a political party, surrounded American and Swiss tourists walking down New Delhi&apos;s streets and harangued them about holding hands.

Slogan-shouting activists also tossed furniture, knocked people&apos;s trays and chased couples out of a Wimpy&apos;s fast food restaurant in New Delhi while police stood nearby, and the gangs harassed young couples buying gifts in northern Indian cities such as Lucknow.

&quot;We will be vigilant. I have asked my men to guard specific places,&quot; Lucknow&apos;s Police Chief Anil Agarwal said this week.

Lucknow college student Latika Arora is tired of the protests. &quot;No one has the right to work as the morals police,&quot; she said.

&quot;We should be able to celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day as we wish.&quot; - Sapa-AP
