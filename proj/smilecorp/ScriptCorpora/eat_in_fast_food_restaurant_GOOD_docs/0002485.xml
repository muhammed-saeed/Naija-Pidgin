 My Healthy Visit to New York City 
 
I’m back from New York! I had an amazing few days in the Big Apple.

 

My hotel room was just a couple of blocks from Central Park, allowing me to go for a daily morning run in the iconic park. I didn’t have any long runs, but ran the full loop, which works out to 10k, very decent. During the day I walked a lot as I visited various sites in the city. I walked for hours, for miles, so running those 10k runs in the morning was a challenge for my tired legs, but I’m so happy I did it. It’s very easy to forget your fitness goals while on vacation, but I wasn’t about to allow that to happen.

While in New York I ate at an amazing restaurant called Pret a Manger, they are a sort of”fast food”but they make all their food fresh on site without any preservatives. It’s insane that this is a“concept”for a fast food restaurant, that making good, healthy sandwiches and salads is a novelty. It makes me want to cry that they cannot be found in Canada. I know that Chipotle Mexican Grill has a very similar philosophy, but I’ve explained before how I’ve no longer thrilled with them, the mountains of rice, etc.

Another thing I noticed while in New York is that everything had the calorie count listed on the menu. EVERYTHING! At McDonald’s, at the little food counters in the airport, even at the Yankees game, you were forced to think about the calories you were about to consume, which I loved! Why can’t they do this in Toronto? People should be aware of what they’re eating, I can’t count how many times those numbers kept me from consuming something I really didn’t need. Here’s a link to a story on the requirements: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/business/24menu.html 

The Women’s 5K race is tomorrow! It’s time to go pick up my race kit. I won’t be running today to give my legs a rest after the beating they’ve taken this week. On top of all the running and walking I was stuck on the airplane for several hours yesterday as the plane was in a line up queued for take off. We literally sat on the runway for almost 2 hours. Being stuck in my seat not able to properly stretch my legs took a toll on them and I’m feeling it today.
