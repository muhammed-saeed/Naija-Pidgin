Bought a Groupon for this place simply due to the location and the fact that I had never heard of them before. I wasn&apos;t expecting much (the cheesy name and small location made me think it was going to be a generic burger joint). My visit has turned me into a believer.

It&apos;s a quaint little establishment that basically looks like an upscale fast food joint with a bar (I believe this place used to be D Martini&apos;s).

I had a Cameron&apos;s Cream Ale (Oakville brewery that I hadn&apos;t seen on tap anywhere else) and the beef tacos and my gf had the chicken burrito. We also shared an order of the cassava fries. Everything was delicious and authentic (the tacos were on par with what you&apos;d get at upscale Mexican joints like Milagro), service was great, the fresh sauces were amazing, and the best part - the prices were incredible. Even without the Groupon, our meal would have been $25. For a pint of craft beer and two delicious meals I can&apos;t complain.

I will definitely be back, I just hope that they shape up their marketing and drum up business so that they stay open. I never would have known this place existed if it wasn&apos;t for the Groupon.

Have you ever tried cassava fries before? I never knew they even existed until I went to All Grill...

By the way, CASSAVA FRIES EFFIN ROCK! If you&apos;re a sweet patoto fries fan, cassava fries are even better! I do not lie. Take it from a true french fries fan.

All Grill is a semi-fast food restaurant (if that makes any sense?). I say semi-fast food because their food offerings are quite healthy since most of their items are &quot;all grilled&quot;. Get it? Haha.

I&apos;m quite upset that I&apos;ve only been once. It&apos;s a little of a trek for me since it&apos;s in Mississauga, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be visiting in the next month. As I write this, my stomach is grumbling for fried cassava.

I had the grilled chicken breast sandwich/burger with cassava fries. Which was delish. What&apos;s cool about All Grill is they offer unique fixings for your burgers which include salsa and many original sauces (which are made in-house) such as their own special mayo in mild and spicy, a type of corn mayo sauce, a cheese kind as well and more. These sauces are also great to dip your cassava fries in!

I am writing this review in hopes that many of you reading this will go and dine here. It&apos;s location is pretty hidden and I don&apos;t want them to close down due to lack of business. So please take my advice and enjoy a healthy fast food meal here. Oh, and don&apos;t forget to order the cassava fries with your meal!

Also bought a groupon for this place or never would have known it existed. Beware of parking in the underground parking lot though, my friend and I walked around for 10 minutes in the festering smell of urine before we were able to find it. It is much easier to find it above ground. Anyway, for a burger joint, the burgers were quite good, reasonably priced and you are able to choose your own toppings. The combo came with a mango salad which was fresh and quite an unique side dish.

I&apos;ve been to this place once and didn&apos;t like neither food nor the service. Moreover, after witnessing the food preparation process,  I would NEVER go back to this place...  The cook/cashier first took my money then went to make the food without even trying to clean his hands. He was taking the meat and the fries with his dirty hands. He dropped the &quot;to go&quot; container on the floor, then picked it up and serve my food in it... Very unsanitary place with tasteless food!

This place gets a 5 star right off the bat. Where I live BBQing on our balcony is prohibited so I go here to get my fix. I&apos;ve tried the burgers, steak, chicken sandwich and the beef and chicken fajitas. All were really good, their flame grill really makes a difference. My fav world have to be the fajitas with sweet potato fries. They also serve local beer, the amber ale is awesome. There is a toppings bar with amazing sauces, guy said they are his mothers receipts; try the green one. Can&apos;t wait to go again!

to be honest. ive been to this place 3 times. the service is always either really good or really bad. the portions are too small for being expensive and the food is pretty bland. the 3 times i had the cassave fried with the thinking that they would be better than last. they got progressively worse and taste frozen and reheated in a microwave. wont go back there again i would rather go to the subway restaurant or fox and fiddle next door.
