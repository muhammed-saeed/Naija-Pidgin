 Kentucky fried chicken (for a fast food restaurant I would always pay cash but everybody is different so I thought I would mention), at my gym in the little lounge called Mix n stirs. like Pete said Sams club doesn&apos;t, probably my dry cleaners doesn&apos;t. Where American express is accepted, there is too many places to name.

At my outlet mall, where you can get cash transactions or exchanges in the booth, no American express card accepted. Reply With Quote Jul 12, 11, 6:57 pm #12 Money card Centurion Member Join Date Jun 2011 Location New York state Posts 977

I&apos;m glad to hear that. did they ask you do you have any other credit cards? did you ask them what other forms of payment do you except other than cash? did you ask them do you take travelers checks?

 AMEX was not accepted at my Ophthalmologists office and a local auto repair body shop. It has been accepted pretty much everywhere else I have shopped. Reply With Quote Jul 12, 11, 11:37 pm #14 peterson Green Member Join Date Oct 2011 Location Atlanta, GA Posts 3 
 
 I might be reviving a semi-dead thread but I just recently had a gripe about this. Most places in japan won&apos;t accept AMEX/VISA/MC unless you go to a restaurant or hotel, but forget it for food vendors, magazine vendors, etc (they only accept japanese payment system).

I had trouble when I unexpectedly had to spend a night in Japan and had no way to call the US because I had frozen my cell phone for the long trip (2mo). And a breakfast in japan restaurant cost half of a day of hotel bill. I know that most places in hongkong accepts amex, maybe due to some partnership. Many places in asia or asian stores in the US won&apos;t accept amex due to higher fees. Other than that I love charging everything on my card since I get travel cash back.

I have worked in a number of businesses where AMEX was not accepted. From my experience, I can tell you that it is greater than 1 in 1000; people who own an AMEX plan for those sorts of things. Even still, looking at profit margins, it would have to be less than 1 in 20. It isn&apos;t just 1% on the sales that you lose, but all of the other sales where they popped out a visa or MC instead.

For MOST businesses, it does NOT make sense for them to accept AMEX. Reply With Quote Oct 5, 11, 1:19 am #16 nloquecido Green Member Join Date Sep 2011 Location USA Posts 4 
 
 On the flip side, the only credit card that Costco accepts is Amex. You can use other debit cards, but as for CREDIT card... only Amex. Reply With Quote Oct 5, 11, 7:16 am #17 Pete838 Centurion Member Join Date Dec 2010 Location Florida Posts 210

For MOST businesses, it does NOT make sense for them to accept AMEX. AMEX is my preferred card, and I tailor my buying to avoid places that do not accept my card.

If I visit a place that I didn&apos;t know shunned AMEX I will pay with another method. No problem. But unless they offer a very unique product or service that I cannot get elsewhere I will not be back. There are several restaurants around my home that I would otherwise frequent that I do not.

So, yes, not accepting my card costs them my business. Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn&apos;t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.

 Oddly, I switched payment methods with State Farm insurance the other day, and they don&apos;t accept Amex; only Visa/MC. Though my local gym accepts Amex.

I recently began a new job in a different rural area, and the only close restaurant/deli/donut shop is a mom&amp;pop store when I&apos;m hungry/forget to brown bag it. I sort of get upset when I forget to bring my MC, because they don&apos;t accept Amex, though they hate seeing plastic there anyway since it costs them a bit more (and they charge the extra .50 or whatever to my bill if I do use it).

Like previous users have mentioned though, I tend to not want to shop at places that won&apos;t accept my new Zync. It&apos;s my primary card for the time being, and I guess it would ultimately be costing me points if I didn&apos;t use it to maximize my rewards to the fullest. Reply With Quote Oct 6, 11, 12:03 am
