Lauded as the best cevapi in town, it actually feels a little soulless and the food is very average- tastes a little manufactured. There is much better cevapi to be had, try Ferhatovic, near the great library. Excellent.

Cevapcici are Bosnian fast food and they are very delicious and cheap.You cannot visit Sarajevo if you do not visit Zeljo and eat cevapcici.

Everyone who comes to Sarajevo should try cevapcici. And the best place to do it is Zeljo. It is not a fancy restaurant with professional staff, but a typical family run place. It is just perfect place to eat Bosnian traditional food. An advice: don&apos;t ask for ketchup or mayonnaise!

While wondering Baščaršija, don&apos;t hestate to stop at one of two premisses of this Bosnian-style fast food (both located in the same street paralel to Miljacka river, just behind the City of Sarajevo Museum). A filling portion of tasty mixed grilled meat will set you back for 7 EUR (bread, chopped onions and mustard included). Be prepaired to wait for... More

Former Yugoslavia is a place to go if you&apos;re interested in recent history, not gourmet food. All the food comes from the octoman domination of the past (kebabm baklava, etc) but in this place downtown you can have a sort of wrap with beef sausages, cream sauce and onions that is very very filling and ridicolously cheap. Dont miss it!

It&apos;s ok and tasty, but you feel like you are in an assembly line in a car factory, you have to eat fast, drink fast, pay fast, because there are always people waiting for a table.
Definitely a Bosnian fast food place.

Traditional Bosnian Fast food are Cevapcici, and this is the best pace to try them. If you like that king of food, I guarantee you, you will want to return for more…and more…and more. The service is excellent and you get the food in no time.

It was our first visit to a restaurant when in Sarajevo and it certainly wasn&apos;t the last! Best cevapcici I have ever eaten!

The place enjoys a nice reputation, which is not justified, as there are many much better places serving this kind of food. It is mostly popular among non-connoisseurs as a matter of fact. However, in spite of being much over-rated, the food they are serving is decent, nothing to be ashamed of. One thing: You don&apos;t, ever, no matter the... More
