There is only one reputed fast food restaurant that I believe is open until 2AM in the morning.

It’s the McDonald’s at DLF Diner near the Microsoft building.

The location is perfect because you can easily get parking near the entry gate.

Food quality is fine here.

However, I do not take soft drinks (Coke/Ice Tea) from this particular outlet because of quality issues. The taste is kind of weird and that gives me the creeps. So, I move to the Subway counter to pick up an Ice Tea. In my experience, Subway ice tea is better than McDonald’s.

One regular problem is that they have a limited menu on offer after 11PM so you would have to lucky to get your choice of Burger.

I tend to take Chicken Mexican Wrap that is always available. But since the demand is low, they take some time to make a fresh one. Good thing is that you get freshly cooked food (well almost).

The place also has other popular chains including Subway and Barista in addition to some less popular outlets with a variety of food options.
