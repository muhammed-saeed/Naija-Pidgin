Restaurant Review: OPA! GYROS



 Gyros in Bogota! 



 By Manuel Rueda, Editorial Director 

 

Sunday, March 21, 2010

























 My friend laughed when the waiter at Opa served our wine in two cheap plastic imitation wineglasses.   We thought we were going to a restaurant, but it turns out Opa is really a fast food joint: so let´s rate it for what it is. 

 Opa specializes in gyro sandwiches, portions are generous -- like at most fast food joints -- and the meat inside your gyros is well roasted and has a somewhat spicy touch. 

 The gyros are packed with fresh vegetables and prices are very reasonable with chicken, beef, and pork gyros costing around 11,000 pesos (about US$5.50).   

 Unfortunately there are no lamb gyros, and not a great variety of Greek delicacies either, except for the traditional Greek salad, which comes with very tasty portions of feta cheese (not real imported feta, but Colombia’s best imitation) that you can also add to your gyros order. 

 There are no heaters to warm you up at your outdoor table on this small outfit´s terrace and the folks there don’t take credit cards“yet”as the cashier told me. 

 Still, you gotta give them some credit for being a fast food restaurant and still offering some Chilean wine. 

 It´s a nice place for a casual meal, service is fast, and the wine was actually quite good, even if it was served to us in plastic cups. 

 However, the lack of lamb was disappointing as well as the lack of some other Greek specialties like ouzo, octopus, or olive paste. 

 It’s important to note that authentic gyros are made from a combination of ground beef and   ground lamb, mixed with spices, and then combined and molded into a leg like shape for cooking over several hours or all day. 

 The traditional Greek Tzadsiki sauce, a cold yogurt, garlic, and cucumber based sauce that accompanies many Greek dishes is available, but lacks the real zing and some of the ingredients that are found in more authentic versions of the sauce.   However, it must but said, that theirs is still quite tasty.   I would ask for extra every time. 

 Go for the gyros but don´t expect much else.   The gyros are good, but overall I´d give this place 3.5 stars out of 5. 

 

I would also add that the owner (who is usually there) or one of the waiters is always very attentive to customers, so the customer service is excellent, and it&apos;s surprising when they constantly ask for critiques of the food and suggestions. This is a very welcome and nice touch that you won&apos;t find in many restaurants in Bogota.

 And please, tell us if you find another Greek restaurant with more variety in Bogota. 

 OPA is located on the corner of Calle 90 with Carrera 14 in Chico and offers delivery by dialing 218-9682.   Their website is under development.
