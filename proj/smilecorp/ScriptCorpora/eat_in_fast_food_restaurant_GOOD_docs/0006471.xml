 Advantages: Great fun for the young and old a like.

 Disadvantages: A long way to go if you do not live in Cornwall!
 
This opinion is about Dobwalls Adventure Park. It is an attraction that is about four miles from the town of Liskard in Cornwall. The forest miniature railway has one of the most extensive networks in Europe. It is a train lover&apos;s haven! The railway has carried around six million passengers since the park opened. It was first opened in 1970 and to locally it is known as&apos;The Forest Railway&apos;.

There are a variety of rides, all in scenic areas and having names based around an American Theme. There are height restrictions to some rides but there is something for all children as well as the adults will like. It is really designed for children, but Shane and I plus Scamp (the dog) enjoyed ourselves too.


** Car Park**

The car park is large and free of charge.


**Dogs**

Dogs are welcome at Dobwalls Adventure Park, but must be kept on a lead. They are not allowed in the play areas or on the train. The main draw back was that there are no doggy bins or water bowls either provided on site, however tap water is readily available for them to drink.



**Eating**

*Pioneer Diner*

This is a fast food restaurant, which sells chips rolls, hot dogs and drinks. Two coffees and a tray of chips cost 2.75. Soft drinks cost 85p a cup.


**How to get there**

It can be found off the A38 at Dobwalls, (going towards the north).


**Locomotive Sheds**

This is where all the working miniature trains live. It is great to look round and to see the trains, which are not running. There is a wide selection from steam to diesel locamotives.

*Rides*

Two trains are running daily and carry passengers free of charge, round the park, as often as they like. There are two stations, which allows passengers to alight, as well as tunnels and bridges to go though or see. I never went on the ride myself due to my back injury. (I would not rec
ommend it for the severely physically disabled as one rides on open carriages.) Shane used a video camera to record the journey and I was able to watch the ride later! The three girls loved the ride.

I am not sure which trains were running on the day I visited, but I am aware that there are two rides round the park. One though the forest and on round the wooded area. Everyone who rode the trains seemed happy, from the youngest child to the eldest adult, and many had more than one trip!


**Pay Extra**

There is a Go-Kart and Junior Driving School but there are extra charges to use these facilities.


**Shops**

* Pick ?n? Mix*

This is a shop that sells sweets and ice creams. It is not too expensive with ice creams costing around 80p for one scoop in a cone.

*Trading Post*

This is a souvenir shop. There are the usual pens, pencils, badges etc.


**Toilet**

There are a number of clean toilets and baby changing facilities though out the park. The only draw back was that there was only one disabled toilet (also not easy to enter as door would not stay open long enough to get wheelchair in)!


**What is there**

*The Tube*

This is an outdoor Helter Skelter Slide. It is suitable for children over the age of seven. There is also a tire swing which younger children may enjoy under parent?s supervision.

*Babes in the Wood*

This is designed for younger children. It is an outside adventure play area.

*Soft Play Area*

This is an indoor play area consisting of a bouncy castle, ball pit and various climbing frames it is designed for the under sevens.

*Timber Tumble*

This is an outdoor adventure area consisting of slides, climbing frames and swings. It is designed for older children.

* Steam Back in Time*

This is a static display in a shed, depicting the development
of the model railway. It also displays memorabilia and also railway models of locomotives and carriages. (The three girls that Shane and I took loved the railway waiting room seat!)

*Forest Cabin*

This is another play area suitable for all children, young and not so young!

* Krazee Kavern*

This is an indoor play area for older children. It consists of slides, ball pools and climbing frames. The ?girls? really enjoyed it in this area. They played for about thirty minutes before coming out for a drink.

*The Stockade*

This is a giant adventure play area in the woodland part of the park for older children. It has a variety of slides, swings, frames and ladders. It is great for the ?monkeys? within the party!

*Playport*

This has more conventional play ground toys including a swing boat. It is close to a large picnic area so ideal for parents to eat whilst their children play.

*The Rattle Snake*

This is a giant slide suitable for older children.


Dobwalls Adventure Park is a great day out and is featured in ?The Good Britain Guide 2001? All in all Shane and myself plus the ?three girls? along with Scamp had a great day out. The entrance was 28.00 for two adults and three teenagers, but we did have a whole day of adventure and only left when the park was closing. Our tickets were stamped allowing us a seven Free return to the park. All in all it is excellent value for money.

Not a bad op at all, Ive probably been a bit harsh with the rating but I just thought you could have descrbied the&apos;rides&apos;a little more and a little more on the atmopshere of the place. Since i was 3 I have been to Dobwalls 6 or 7 times a year and loved. It used to be a fabulous day out where children could use upall their energy on the adventure play forts. Unfortunately the influence of Flambards has been great and they have had to bring in Go Karts and whatever but it is a fabulous day out for children under 13 - though begining to look a bit pircey!
