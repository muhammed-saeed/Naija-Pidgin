 We are Ending the Trend of Obesity! 
 June 20, 2011 tags: active duty , business opportunity , eat right , endthetrend , military , obesity , prizes , workout 
I’m still on a natural high after our annual meeting, internally known as Summit. Summit is the place where we come together as a Team Beachbody family to get the tools and information we need to reach greater heights with our personal and financial goals! I’m not at my“summit”but I am flat out excited about where my future is going with this company! Our theme this year is End The Trend! What trend? The trend of obesity in this country, and in the world! It is my personal, and Beachbody’s corporate, mission to end the trend of obesity, one person at a time.

In addition to all the wonderful things happening with Beachbody (see below), I heard a VERY alarming tidbit of information at Summit. One that I believe is worth sharing. It was said that 28 people died last year due to terrorism. But, 120 THOUSAND people have died due to obesity! Why are we more concerned about something that someone might someday do to us than we are about what some people are doing to themselves? I used to ask myself why certain people think I’m crazy for working out, or think it is too expensive to eat right, or introduce healthier alternatives as a lifestyle. Notice I didn’t say DIET! But, those are the same people who will drive to a fast food restaurant, DAILY, sit on the couch, DAILY, then wonder why they have no energy, and don’t lose weight. I stopped asking. You see, I believe that we make choices–good and bad.

My part in ending the trend of obesity is to share what I have learned and am still learning, what has worked for me, and what has worked for thousands and thousands of others. So, if you’re reading this and if what you are doing is not working, I encourage you to try something different.

We, as a company, are doing some amazing things for very average people. To name a few:

1. Team Beachbody is allowing active duty military the opportunity to own their own business at no cost!!
2. Team Beachbody is giving away $100,000 to one male and one female with the greatest body transformation using Beachbody products!!
3. Team Beachbody is awarding DAILY prizes to people just like you, if you simply join Team Beachbody (for free, even) and log your workouts to help keep you motivated!!!

You don’t have to be spectacular, you just have to want a change.

So I ask you–ARE YOU READY? Join ME! It starts with YOU!

 Beachbody is a“Rising Star”! 
 June 11, 2011 tags: direct selling , dsa , mlm , network marketing 
In case you haven’t heard the news, Beachbody has been named as a RISING STAR from the Direct Selling Association. Each year, the Direct Selling Association (DSA) awards a direct selling company a top honor of being a rising star, the one to watch out for. According to the DSA website, a rising star award is given to“recognize up-and-coming direct selling companies that have dedicated themselves to achieving a high standard of excellence in business operations.”What must a direct selling company have to qualify for this prestigious award?

 Companies must have been an active DSA member for at least one year. Companies must have begun direct selling operations less than five years ago. Companies must illustrate a commitment to the tenets of the DSA Code of Ethics. Companies must illustrate a consistent and continued pattern of growth. Companies must demonstrate a well-rounded business strategy including projections for growth in sales, salesforce and tangential activities such as charitable giving. 

I’m proud to be a part of this company! If you are passionate about your health and fitness, you can make money with your passion. Become a Team Beachbody Coach, like me to help inspire others to achieve their goals and enjoy a healthy, fulfilling life.

 Shakeology In the Press and New Flavor, Soon To Be, Hot off the Presses! 
 June 2, 2011 tags: creator of shakeology , darin olien , energy , shakeology , Shakeology in the News , shakeology ingredients , Superfoods 
As I have said over and over again, Shakeology is the REAL DEAL. I have been drinking one glass of Shakeology a day for well over a year now. The differences between the pre-shakeology-a-day me and the currently-using shakeology me are profound! I have noticed a significant increase in my energy (boy did I need THAT). My skin is healthier and it has made for a MUCH more pleasurable bathroom experience. I know, TMI, but I have to keep it real!

Anyway, don’t take my word for it. Read. Watch. Listen. The Co-Creator of Shakeology and its ingredients were featured in the May 2011 issue of Oprah Magazine and on Fox News L.A.

 Superfoods For Your Good Health: MyFoxLA.com 

I JUST happen to know that a NEW FLAVOR(S) will soon be released on June 15 and I want YOU to be the first to know about it. For that to happen, I will need to you to LIKE my Facebook page to the——&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right!

By the way, there is really no risk to trying Shakeology. Beachbody has made it a total win-win. You can buy it and if you don’t find that it works for you, there is a 30-day MONEY BACK, bottom of the bag, guarantee. To order it now (or get your sample) you simply have to visit my Shakeology tab above! Some might say I can’t afford to drink it. Well I say that you can’t afford NOT to drink it!

 Why You Have to Find What Works for YOU! 
 May 31, 2011 tags: Exercise , Hashimotos , lose weight , Thyroid Disease , Underactive Thyroid , weight loss 
For some, losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight simply means working out 3-5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. We’ve all heard that before, right? Well, I have learned in the past, say 8 years, that the general guidelines which apply to most people may not apply to me. Yes, I work out 6, and sometimes more, times per week but I do NOT do it because I’m“crazy”,“addicted”,“trying to get skinny”, or just“trying to look good”. I work out as much as I do so I do not GAIN weight! Yes, so I do not gain weight. Why? Because during my pregnancy with my oldest daughter, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Disease (or Hypothyroidism ). What that means is that my thyroid gland–the gland that serves to regulate certain important processes in my body–may not work as well as it should (or at all) and greatly increases the chances that I will GAIN weight! Great, right? As if I needed another reason to make it more difficult to lose the baby weight!! Seriously, though, I’m okay with that. If this is my struggle, then so be it. Perhaps someone is meant to learn from my experience! To that end, my diagnosis has taught me a couple of things: (1) I may have to do more than most people to simply maintain my weight; (2) I cannot obsess about a specific number on the scale. As long as I don’t see an increase, I’m happy; and (3) I appreciate EVERY goal I accomplish because seeing a difference on MY scale has been no easy task. I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish through this journey!

Keep in mind, as with spandex, there is simply not a“one size fits all”approach to losing or maintaining your weight. That said, my suggestion to you is to learn what your body needs to reach YOUR goals. Start with the USDA Guidelines .

Maybe you need to readjust your thinking.
Maybe you need to adjust your diet.
Maybe you need to readjust your ideas about what it takes to reach your goals.
Maybe you need to do something different to get a different result!

 Was I ready for a live workout with Shaun T just one day after the release of Insanity:The Asylum? 
 May 18, 2011 tags: Asylum , beachbody , DIG DEEP , fit kids , fitness , get real , hiphop abs , Insanity , Shaun T , The Asylum , workout 
I was anxiously awaiting the release of Insanity:Asylum! I mean, I did Insanity three times. After the second time, I had ALREADY lost over 22 inches all over my body. Insanity literally CHANGED the shape of my body and gave me a confidence and endurance that I had long forgotten. It was a no-brainer that I was going to get Insanity:The Asylum as soon as it was released. Don’t know what Insanity:The Asylum is? Check it out by clicking http://beachbodycoach.com/esuite/home/fitcounselor?bctid=895599538001 

Anyway, I knew Shaun T was coming to my‘hood, so I signed up RIGHT away for a live workout. I really was NOT sure I was ready. In fact, I was a little afraid but I thought“I can hang.”Well, I did, BARELY! For real, Shaun T was on some new stuff when he got to the stage. By new I mean he pulled out some moves I had NEVER seen. Of course he hit us with some Insanity moves but when he hit us with the Asylum moves, it really WAS CRAZY!! Seriously, he killed it! He killed me and the other, I don’t know, 200 guests lucky enough to be in his presence! And I loved every minute of it (yeah, I’m a little insane too when it comes to my workouts!)

If you are like me and countless other Insanity, HipHopAbs, Rockin’Body, Get Real, and FIt Kids fans and graduates, before you meet him, you honestly feel like you know Shaun T. What I will say having spent some time with him, however, is that the DVD programs do not capture Shaun T as a person. He is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet. He broke it down in a Q&amp;A session before the workout. He gave us the real deal on everything from what we can expect from Asylum, his diet, his favorite workout, if he does Insanity, and how“DIG DEEP”is so much more than a physical concept. Curious?

Well, before the workout ended, I was able to capture a quick video snippet during the break before the LAST circuit of the workout, which felt like a lifetime. Once I figure out how to upload the video, you will get just a little taste of why Shaun T is an awesome motivator, trainer, and why he was able to push me to new limits with EACH and EVERY move!

By the way, I have since started Insanity:The Asylum and my words won’t do it justice. You just have to try it and see for yourself. Asylum is challenging my body in ways I could not have imagined. Thank you Shaun T for coming out with yet ANOTHER awesome program to get ME in the best shape of my life!

‘Til next time!

 Low Carb Works for ME! 
 May 12, 2011 tags: healthy fats , low carb , paleo , primal , quick fix 
I have a feeling that when people hear“low carb”, visions of BACON, CHEESE, GREASY SPOONS, and BAD FATS come to mind. I’m here to tell you that all low-carb is not created equal. It is not a fad; it has been around forever ( Paleo and Primal come to mind). What I have been eliminating are the BAD CARBS–the processed carbs, refined sugars, white sugars, corn starches, etc.–that were not intended for human consumption. If it doesn’t exist without a machine, then you probably shouldn’t eat it. I’m no extremist and I’m not perfect, because I too have my slip ups, but for the most part, I make my food choices reflect fresh, healthy, colorful versions of what is in our world. By that I mean healthy proteins (meats, fish, poultry), vegetables (green leafy ones mostly) and healthy fats (avocados, nuts). And I don’t feel deprived. Listen, I’m not a nutritionist, but I know it works for me, in my current condition. You have to find what works for you. WORD OF CAUTION: Don’t do it because you want a quick fix. Those never last. Do it because you want a change, a real change, a healthy change, and a lifestyle change!

 I’ve accomplished quite a bit on my fitness journey… 
 March 24, 2011 tags: beachbody , coaching , fitness , helping people , weight loss 
If you have seen my before and after pictures then you can believe that I’ve accomplished quite a bit on my fitness journey but, understand something, this journey means nothing to me if I can’t use what I have learned to influence others to get fit.

If you are ready to commit to a health and fitness journey, I am ready to help you, for free!
