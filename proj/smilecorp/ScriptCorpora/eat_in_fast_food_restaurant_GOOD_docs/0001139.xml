Yo quiero Taco Bell!Two young men ride in an older
BMW car while listening to 80&apos;s music and happily
munching on fast food from Taco Bell. Above the
back seat sits a bobbing plastic dog. Suddenly,
the young men look in their rear-view mirror and
to their surprise realize that the plastic dog has
been replaced by a little pointy-eared Chihuahua
with bulging eyes. This dog is very much alive,
and he will do just about anything to get his
little canine teeth around some of that delicious
food. In his quest for ultimate satisfaction, the
Chihuahua speaks out, &quot;Yo quiero Taco Bell!&quot; -
translated into, &quot;I want Taco Bell!&quot; It was a cute
dog, whose catchy phrases like this one had
captured the imagination and excitement of many
Taco Bell consumers.

Their marketing campaign was
a success because the dog was able to connect with
their targeted market of young adults who primary
thinks about food, sex, and parties. Every new
commercial was widely discussed across school
courtyards. At one point, the dog&apos;s catch phrases
had even become a part of human vernacular. Taco
Bell achieved this level of success by connecting
their advertising character with the audience
through humor and satire reflected in the
stereotypes coming out of the quasi-Mexican image
presented in the commercials and by exploiting the
Chihuahua&apos;s cute image to appeal to the viewers.
After the launch of the first Chihuahua commercial
and its rapid cute image appeal to the broad based
market, it became apparent that Taco Bell&apos;s
marketing campaign was right on the mark. The dog,
named Dinky, characterized by its bulging eyes,
innocent expressions, tiny size, irresistible
Spanish accent, and its catchy phrases like, &quot;Here
lizard, lizard, lizard&quot; and &quot;I think I need a
bigger box&quot; was simply adorable

Dinky&apos;s image was
trustworthy; after all, a dog is a man&apos;s best
friend. In turn, the voice of Taco Bell, shadowed
by the cute advertising character that people saw
through their television tube, exploited the
audience&apos;s emotions to appeal to the person&apos;s
subconscious rather than the physical mind itself.
In Jack Solomon&apos;s essay, Masters of Desire: The
Culture of American Advertising, he states that,
&quot;The success of modern advertisings, its
penetration into every corner of American life,
reflects a culture that has itself chosen illusion
over reality.&quot;(170). Taco Bell&apos;s Chihuahua
commercials is just another example of how today&apos;s
advertising campaigns are targeted to appealing to
the viewer&apos;s subconscious emotions because
ad-created images of a product, such as
trustworthiness and companionship found in Dinky&apos;s
character, show a pattern of selling better than
the product itself. The cute Chihuahua, that so
happens to take the viewer&apos;s breath away with its
adorable look, also connects with the audience
through laughter by reflecting the stereotypes of
a quasi-Mexican image. A simple smile from the
viewer opens a lot doors for the marketers.

Behind
one of these doors is an opportunity to engage the
viewer in the commercial, establishing a link
between them and the brand. Taco Bell&apos;s use of a
Chihuahua, rather than a famous mainstream artist,
to portray Mexican people and culture reinforces
the stereotypes that Mexican people are dirty,
uncivilized, and small in stature because a dog
would eat anything that it finds on the streets
and it&apos;s tiny in comparison to the dominant human
race, especially a Chihuahua of all canines.
Furthermore, Dinky&apos;s color is brown - the same
color that often associated with a Hispanic&apos;s skin
tone and disrespectful if used to categorize their
race. However, the audience laughs because there
is no way to take a four-legged, burrito-craving
animal seriously when all it wants is some Taco
Bell. Michael Omi brings up a similar situation in
his essay, In Living Color: Race and American
Culture. At one point, he analyzes the popularity
of the Saturday Night Live show, despite
televising comedy skits such as Ching Chang,
&quot;which depicted a Chinese storeowner and his
family in a derogatory manner&quot; (pg.

558). &quot;It&apos;s
funny,&quot; most people would answer, just as the
Chihuahua is funny when it imitates a Spanish
accent. Although, making fun of the Mexican
culture is not part of Taco Bell&apos;s direct
intentions, the humor that it produces from the ad
engages the viewer in the commercial and
reinforces these stereotypes in their mind. As Omi
argues, &quot;Our &apos;common sense&apos; assumptions about race
and racial minorities in the United States are
both generated and reflected in the stereotypes
presented by the visual media&quot; (pg. 562).

As an
example, he states that, &quot;Blacks are associated
with drugs and urban crime, Latinos with &apos;illegal&apos;
immigration, while Native Americans cope with
alcoholism and tribal conflicts&quot; (pg. 564). Taco
Bell&apos;s choice of a Chihuahua to advertise their
brand translated into high popularity of their
commercials at the expense of portraying Mexican
people as being &quot;less than human.&quot;The fact that
Dinky is a Chihuahua who speaks Spanish may be
offensive to some; yet he was recognized in
American pop culture as being cute and funny.
Dinky was like the Pillsbury Doughboy, but for
tacos and burritos instead of cookies and muffins.
The dog had a gift for putting on smiles on
viewer&apos;s faces, filling their hearts with joy, and
making them feel welcomed at Taco Bell locations.
In Snap! Crackle! Plot!, Roy Rivenburg writes,
&quot;Product mascots .. are so well known to us ..
signifying just how ad-saturated a culture we are&quot;
(pg 780). Is this really true? Well next time you
pass by a Chihuahua being walked in the park, take
a mental not of the first thing that comes to
mind.

Don&apos;t be surprised if a sudden craving for a
Grilled Stuff Burrito stimulates the taste buds.
Taco Bell successfully exploited the character&apos;s
hip attributes to influence the consumer&apos;s choice
of a fast food restaurant. Dinky was also the
leading force behind Taco Bell&apos;s future success in
launching new product lines, such as the Gorditas
and the Grande Meal. Works CitedOmi, Michael. &quot;In
