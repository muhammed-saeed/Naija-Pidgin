Post by topher on Jun 12, 2006, 2:31pm

Have a joke you would like to share?

Here is my lame joke.

A Koala bear is walking down the street. A prostitute comes up to him and says&quot;Hey, you wanna have a good time?&quot;The Koala Bear says Yes and follows the prostitute upstairs to the hotel room. The bear sits down.

Prostitute:&quot;Before we get started, you owe me fifty bucks.&quot;The Koala Koala Bear:&quot;I don&apos;t understand.
Prostitute:&quot;I am hooker.&apos;
Koala Bear: I still don&apos;t understand.

Well there happens to be a dictionary on the nightstand, the prostitute picks it up and tells the Koala Bear to look up the definition of prostitute. The KB puts on his glasses and looks up the definition and reads aloud:

KB: Prostitute:One who sells sex for money.

&quot;Well see, now&quot;the KB states&quot;I don&apos;t have to pay.&quot;

Pro: Why?
KB: Because I am a Koala Bear:
Pro: I don&apos;t understand why you don&apos;t have to pay:
KB: The reason is explained in the dictionary.

The KB picks up the dictionary and hands it to the prostitute. The prostitute turns to Koala Bear and reads aloud:

Pro: Koala Bear, a small animal that eats bush and leaves.

So he did.

A blond, a brunette, a redhead, two drunks, a talking horse, a priest, a rabbi, a minister, a dog and a piece of string all walk into a bar.

The bartender looks at them and goes,&quot;What is this? Some kind of joke?&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor 
Post by india7 on Jun 12, 2006, 3:10pm

What did the blonde say when she was watching a porno film?
&quot;Look, see! There I am!&quot;

What&apos;s the first thing a blonde does when she gets up in the morning?
Goes home.

A blonde and a brunette were both thrown off of a tall skyscraper. Which one hit the ground first?
The brunette. The blonde had to stop and ask for directions.

 (See? Even at the expense of my fellow brunette getting splattered all over the place, that&apos;s a damn fine joke!) 

Okay, time for the long one:

A blonde gets tired of always being the topic of blonde jokes. So she decides to see just how much respect she would get as a brunette.

She dyes her hair black and goes outside to see how she gets treated. As she wanders past a farmer tending to his herd of cows, she boldly walks up to him and says,&quot;Sir, I&apos;d like to place a bet. If I can tell you exactly how many cows are in your herd, I get to keep one.&quot;

The crusty old farmer thinks it over and says,&quot;All right, young lady. You have a deal.&quot;

So the blonde/brunette whips out a calculator, does a little calculus, a little long division, etc. and then announces to the farmer,&quot;You have 217 cows in your herd.&quot;

The farmer IS impressed. He says,&quot;Okay then, young lady. I never go back on a bet. You head out there, pick out one of my cows and she&apos;s yours to keep.&quot;

The blonde/brunette happily scampers out to the herd, picks what she wants, waves to the farmer and heads home.

A few hours later, her doorbell rings. She answers it, and it&apos;s the farmer!

&quot;Well, hello again!&quot;she says.

He&apos;s just staring at her, like a casino-pit boss would stare at a fake $100 bill. She says,&quot;Well, what can I do for you?&quot;

The farmer says,&quot;Uh huh... I&apos;ll tell you what, young lady. I have a bet of my own for you. If I can guess your real haircolor, can I have my dog back?&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor 
Post by aims on Jun 12, 2006, 3:27pm

Three young bulls were talking in the pasture one day. They start talking about what they are going to do for their summer vacations. The first bull (trying to be all impressive) says...
&quot;I&apos;M joining the rodeo, I&apos;m going to be the best most fearsome bull ever and I&apos;m going to buck off every cowboy&quot;.

The second bull (not to be outdone) says...
&quot;I&apos;M going to Spain and I&apos;m going to battle the matador. I&apos;m going to be famous&quot;.

The third bull (the coolest of them all ) just merely states....
&quot;Hmmm....that all sounds good but I think I&apos;ll just stay home and help out my dad&quot;.

A blonde and a brunette are going up an elevator. A guy gets on the elevator and the two ladies quickly notice how hot he is, but then they notice that he has pretty bad dandruff. He gets off the elevator and the ladies are still going up.

&quot;He&apos;s too cute to have dandruff. We should give him Head and Shoulders&quot;says the brunette.

The blonde says,&quot;How do we give him shoulders ?&quot;

I can tell I&apos;m going to worship and adore this thread.

Two peanuts walked into a bar. One was a salted.

A man took his dog to the vet for a check-up. The vet picked up the dog, gave him a thorough examination, then turned to the owner and said,&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m going to have to put your dog down.&quot;Horrified, the owner cried,&quot;Why?&quot;The vet replied,&quot;He&apos;s just really heavy.&quot;

And finally: one for Kafka...

A bear walked into a bar and said,&quot;I&apos;d like a pineapple juice and a ........................................................................................................................ ......................................................................................................................... ................................................................packet of dry roasted peanuts please.

Is it the Joke Thread or the Too Much Information Thread? Only YOU can decide!:

A little Dachsund and a big huge Great Dane were in the vet&apos;s office.

The Great Dane looks at the Dachsund and says,&quot;Hey little man. What are you in for?&quot;

The Dachsund says,&quot;Eh, you know how it is. I&apos;ve been humping my peoples&apos; legs a bit too much lately and they&apos;re tired of it. So, they&apos;ve sent me in to get my balls snipped!&quot;

The big Great Dane says,&quot;Oh, I know how you feel. The other night, my mistress came out of the shower, and dropped her towel. She bent over to pick it up and I just got one look at her, and... and I just couldn&apos;t help myself! I climbed up on her and just started going at it!&quot;

The little Dachsund says,&quot;Oh wow! So you&apos;re in for the same thing too, huh?&quot;

The Great Dane says,&quot;Naww, just to get my nails trimmed.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor 
Post by kostgard on Jun 12, 2006, 3:50pm

Okay - blonde joke.


A blonde, brunette, and a redhead are sitting in the waiting room of an OB-GYN. All three are pregnant and the blonde is eavesdropping as the brunette and the redhead are discussing the theory that the sexual position you are in when you get pregnant determines the gender of your child.

The brunette says,&quot;Well, I was on the bottom, so that means I&apos;m having a boy.&quot;

The redhead says,&quot;I was on top, so that means I&apos;m going to have a girl.&quot;

Suddenly the blonde starts sobbing hysterically. The two other women look over at her in alarm and ask her what is wrong.

The blonde manages to choke out through her tears,&quot;I&apos;m...I&apos;m having puppies!!!&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

Post by oxynia on Jun 12, 2006, 4:04pm

My joke&apos;s a wee bit long but iMHO, I think it&apos;s worth it....

Dubya has a massive heart attack in the Oval Office and drops dead.

(No wait, there&apos;s more!)

He awakes to find himself at the entrance to Hell, where he is met by the Devil himself.

 &quot;Well, well&quot; says the Devil. &quot;We&apos;ve been waiting for you! No-one deserves to be here more than you but we seem to have a bit of a problem. We have no room for you. But here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do...I have three people here who weren&apos;t nearly as bad as you so I&apos;m willing to let one of them free. I&apos;ll even let you choose the person, but choose wisely because you will inherit whatever punishment they were sentenced to for all eternity.&quot; 

Bush agrees, and the Devil leads him to the first room and opens the door. Inside is a massive yard filled with giant boulders. Ronald Reagan stands in the middle of the room swinging an enormous pick-axe, breaking the boulders down into smaller and smaller rocks. Over and over and over again he swings the giant axe, breaking down rocks with no rest, for all eternity.

Bush thinks to himself&quot;aw nuts, I love this guy, he&apos;s my hero! I would give anything to set him free but I couldn&apos;t swing that axe forever, not with my bad shoulder.&quot;

So he says to the Devil, &quot;No, sorry, I can&apos;t do this one.&quot; 

Devil says &quot;fine&quot; and takes him to another room where there is a giant swimming pool the length of ten Olympic pools. In the middle of the pool is Richard Nixon, swimming back and forth endlessly, lap after lap after lap without stopping, for all eternity.

Bush thinks to himself&quot;aw damn, this guy deserves a break. He got treated very unfairly when he was alive. I would love to set him free but it&apos;s too bad I never learned how to swim.&quot;

So he says to the Devil, &quot;No, sorry, I can&apos;t do this one either, but you&apos;re doing a heckuva job, Devvie. What else have you got?&quot; 

Devil says &quot;fine&quot; and leads him to the third and final room in which there is a big, plush oversized bed on which Bill Clinton lies, naked and spread-eagled. Leaning over him is Monica Lewinsky, doing that thing she is most famous for doing.

Bush thinks to himself&quot;shit, I hate this guy!! I hate the idea of setting him free! But I have to admit, out of everything I&apos;ve seen here, his punishment doesn&apos;t look too bad.&quot;

So he says to the Devil, &quot;OK Devil, I&apos;ll take this one.&quot; 



Devil says &quot;Fine...Monica, you&apos;re free to go.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

I loved the bull one.

 50th Wedding Anniversary 

A man and his wife were celebrating 50 years together. Their three kids, all very successful, agreed to a Sunday dinner in their honor.

&quot;Happy Anniversary Mom and Dad,&quot;gushed son number one...&quot;Sorry I&apos;m running late... had an emergency, you know how it is, didn&apos;t have time to get you both a present.&quot;

Not to worry,&quot;said the dad...&quot;the important thing is that we&apos;re all here together today.&quot;

Son number two arrived and announced,&quot;you and Mom still look great, Dad.
Just flew in from L.A. and didn&apos;t have time to get you a present... Sorry.&quot;


&quot;It&apos;s nothing,&quot;said the father,&quot;Glad you were able to be here.&quot;

Just then the daughter arrived,&quot;Hello both of you, Happy Anniversary! I&apos;m sorry, but my boss is sending me out of town and I was really busy packing... so I didn&apos;t have time to get you guys anything.&quot;

Again the father said,&quot;I really don&apos;t care, at least the five of us are together today.&quot;



After they had all finished dessert, the father put down his knife and fork, looked up and said,&quot;Listen up, all three of you, there&apos;s something your mother and I have wanted to tell you for a long time.


You see, we were very poor. Despite this, we were able to raise each of you and send you to college. All through the years your mother and I knew that we loved each other very much but... we just never found the time to get married.&quot;


The three kids gasp and said,&quot;You mean we&apos;re bastards?&quot;



&quot;Yep,&quot;said the dad...&quot;and cheap ones too!&quot;

This one is pretty stupid. I hope I&apos;m not the only one who finds it funny!

Three hungry burglars break into a warehouse, which stores food. The security guard hears them, and they only have a minute to hide. Each one of them crawls inside a potato sack. The security guard enters the room. After looking around he concludes that they must be hiding in the potato sacks.

He kicks the first sack.&quot;Ruff! Ruff!&quot;says the sack.&quot;It&apos;s only a stupid dog.&quot;thinks the guard and he moves on.

He kicks the second sack.&quot;Meow!&quot;says the sack.&quot;It&apos;s only a stupid cat.&quot;thinks the guard and he moves on.

He kicks the final sack.&quot;Potato!&quot;says the sack.

Post by limey on Jun 12, 2006, 7:47pm

Ok here is a couple that I found pretty funny today:
 $1000 Tattoo 
A guy goes to the tatoo parlor and offers the tattoo artist $1,000 to put a $100 bill on his willie. The artist agrees, but is curious and asks the man why he wants to do this.
The man replies,&quot;I have my reasons which I would rather not tell right now.&quot;

So, the artist goes ahead and does the job. But, all the while he is anxious with curiosity over why this man wants a $100 bill on his penis.

So, he tells the man that he really needs to know the reason why and says that the man can keep the $1000 he would have paid for the tatoo if he would just tell the reason for putting a $100 bill on his willie.

So, the man consents and offers these three reasons:&quot;First, I like to play with my money. Second, I like to watch my money grow. And third, and most importantly, the next time my wife wants to blow $100, she can stay home to do it.&quot;
 Doctor&apos;s visit 
An old man and a old lady went in the doctor&apos;s office to have there yearly exam done. The doctor came in and started to get some information from them. He then told the old man that he needed to have a stool sample and a urine sample.
The old man turned to the old lady and asked, &apos;what&apos;d he said?&apos;

She looked at him and said, &apos;he needs a pair of your underwear.&apos;

 Wedding Cake 
A dietician was once addressing a large audience in Chicago.
&quot;The material we put into our stomachs is enough to have killed most of us sitting here, years ago.&quot;

Red meat is awful. Soft drinks erode your stomach lining. Chinese food is loaded with MSG. Vegetables can be disastrous, and none of us realizes the long-term harm caused by the germs in our drinking water.

&quot;But there is one thing that is the most dangerous of all and we all have, or will, eat it.

Can anyone here tell me what food it is that causes the most grief and suffering for years after eating it?&quot;

A 75-year-old man in the front row stood up and said,&quot;Wedding cake.&quot;



And finally somthing that was forwarded to me, Diary of a Cat:


DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture.
Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant.

DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair...must try this on their bed.

DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.

DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was...Hmmm. Not working according to plan...

DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called&quot;shampoo.&quot;What sick minds could invent such a liquid? My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth.

DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call&quot;beer.&quot;More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of&quot;allergies.&quot;Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.

DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and may be snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to mole speak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured. But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.

Peter asks the first nun,&quot;Have you ever touched a man&apos;s penis?&quot;
First nun answers,&quot;Yes. Once. With my finger.&quot;
Peter says,&quot;Please dip your finger in the Holy Water and enter.&quot;

Peter asks the second nun,&quot;Have you ever touched a man&apos;s penis?&quot;
Second nun answers,&quot;Yes. Once. With my hand.&quot;
Peter says,&quot;Please dip your hand in the Holy Water and enter.

 Okay, a bit of a disclaimer before this next one.

Here&apos;s how far I&apos;ll take my hubris - my co-worker who originally told me the joke? After he heard me repeat it to someone, he said,&quot;Okay, that&apos;s it - from now on, YOU tell that joke. The Reagan imitation is too spot on!&quot;And there were several times he&apos;d call me, conference me in with another person, and say,&quot;Okay, go ahead and do the Reagan joke for so and so&quot;! So please, keep Ronald Reagan&apos;s voice in your head as this joke goes along, because it&apos;s alot funnier that way.

One day a five year old little girl excitedly approached her mother, and announced that she had learned how you get a baby. The mother was amused and said,&quot;Oh really sweetie, why don&apos;t you tell me all about it?&quot;

The little girl then explained,&quot;Well, the mommy and daddy take off all of their clothes, and the daddy&apos;s wiener stands way up high, and the mommy kneels on the floor and puts the daddy&apos;s wiener in her mouth, and then the daddy&apos;s wiener sort of explodes and makes sticky juice into the mommy&apos;s mouth, and then the mommy swallows the sticky juice, and that&apos;s how you get a baby.&quot;

The mother looked lovingly at her daughter, leaned over to meet her eye to eye and said,&quot;Oh honey, that&apos;s sweet, but that&apos;s not how you get a baby. That&apos;s how you get jewelry.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

So these two drunk guys go to a whorehouse. They tell the madame&quot;Give us your best girls&quot;The madame takes one look at them and thinks there is no way she&apos;s going to waste her best girls on these two. Instead, she whispers to the girl behind her to put the two blow-up dolls in the rooms upstairs. When the dolls are ready, she leads the guys to their rooms.

When the guys are finished they meet downstairs and start walking home. After a while the one drunk guy asks his friend&quot;So, how was it?&quot;

His friend said&quot;I think she was dead&quot;
&quot;Why did you think she was dead?&quot;he asked
&quot;Well,&quot;he started&quot;When we were makin&apos; love, she didn&apos;t do or say anything. No moans or groans of pleasure, no giggles. Nothing. What about you?
&quot;I can&apos;t say mine was any better. I think my girl was a witch.&quot;
&quot;A witch, how so?&quot;his friend exclaimed
&quot;Because when I gave her a love bite on the neck, she farted and flew out the window.&quot;

 Q: Why don&apos;t cannibals eat clowns?

A: Because they taste funny. 
 

Years and years ago, when my best friend Kerrin and I were roommates in Brooklyn, I was trying, at that time to break into singing and stand-up comedy, like every other person in NY.

So one evening, Kerrin comes home from work and says,&quot;So and So at work told the DUMBEST joke today, and then got all snotty with me because I didn&apos;t laugh. I said to him, &apos;My roommate is trying to break into stand up comedy, and I&apos;ll bet SHE won&apos;t think it&apos;s funny!&apos; So now I have to tell you this dumb joke and PROVE to them that it&apos;s not funny when you don&apos;t laugh at it.&quot;

I go,&quot;Okay, go ahead.&quot;

Kerrin -&quot;Why didn&apos;t the cannibal want to eat the clown?&quot;

Me -&quot;Why?&quot;

Kerrin -&quot;Because he was afraid he&apos;d taste funny&quot;.

Well, you know what happened next, don&apos;t you? I cracked up laughing till I almost fell over! The best part was the look on Kerrin&apos;s face! She had her arms crossed and this look of&quot;There! Told you it was dumb!&quot;on her face. When I started laughing my ass off, the look changed to utter&quot;Holy shit! You&apos;re laughing!&quot;Just total shocked horror!

So not only did she have to report back to them the next day that her roommate the aspiring comedian DID think the joke was funny, but she had to listen to me giggling my head off intermittently all night long!

&quot;Heeee....heeeeee heeeee heee!!! Thought he&apos;d taste funny!&quot;

&quot;Breast-fed&quot;she replied.

&quot;Well, strip down to your waist,&quot;the doctor ordered. She did. He pinched her nipples, then pressed, kneaded, and rubbed both breasts for a while in a detailed examination.

Motioning to her to get dressed, he said,&quot;No wonder this baby is underweight. You don&apos;t have any milk.&quot;

 A Marine&apos;s letter home 

Dear Ma&amp;Pa:

Am well. Hope you are. Tell brother Walt&amp;Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled.

I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt&amp;Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, they git warm water.

Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc..., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie, and other regular food. But tell Walt&amp;Elmer you can always sit between two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon, when you get fed again. It&apos;s no wonder these city boys can&apos;t walk much.

We go on&quot;route&quot;marches, which the Platoon Sergeant says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A&quot;route march&quot;is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys gets sore feet and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat.

The Sergeant is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors&amp;Colonels just ride around&amp;frown. They don&apos;t bother you none.

This next will kill Walt&amp;Elmer with laughing. I keep getting medals for shooting. I don&apos;t know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk and don&apos;t move. And it ain&apos;t shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don&apos;t even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes.

Be sure to tell Walt&amp;Elmer to hurry&amp;join before other fellers get into this setup&amp;come stampeding in.

Your loving daughter,

Gail

P.S. Speaking of shooting, enclosed is $200 towards a new barn roof&amp;Ma&apos;s teeth. The city boys shoot craps, but not very good. Re: Jokes and Humor

Post by pearlysweetcake on Jun 19, 2006, 10:54pm

I remember the arm punch you gave me when I told that joke, WitchyPoo . 

Okay, by special request, here&apos;s the joke.

***********

 Hellmann&apos;s mayonnaise 
Most people don&apos;t know that back in 1912, Hellmann&apos;s mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York.

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico.... But as we know....the great ship did not make it to New York....The ship hit an iceberg and sank....and the cargo was forever lost....

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery....were disconsolate at the loss....

Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning which they still observe to this day.... The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th.... and is known....of course....as Sinko de Mayo....

 How many dogs does it take to change a light bulb? 

 Pomeranian: Yippee, this&apos;ll be fun! I&apos;ll just round up a few dozen of my closest friends and we&apos;ll do the old canine pyramid so we can reach the lamp. We&apos;ll have it done in no time, and then it&apos;s time for kisses!

 American Eskimo Dog : For you, I&apos;ll try anything, but can&apos;t we just play catch while the sun shines?

 Keeshond : I&apos;ll be happy to do it just as soon as I&apos;ve kissed everyone thoroughly so they won&apos;t be afraid of the dark.

 Eurasier : Forget that dumb old light bulb! It&apos;s not even dark right now; besides, I&apos;ll protect the family in the dark.

 German Spitz : Just give me a boost and I can do it all by myself!

 Jack Russel Terrier : I&apos;ll just pop it in while bouncing off the walls and furniture.

 Fox Terrier : That&apos;s so boring--wouldn&apos;t you like to see a really interesting trick?

 Bull Terrier : Oops, sure was a delicate thing, wasn&apos;t it? Tastes good, though!

 English Shepherd : Already done. I installed a ceiling fan while I was up there.

 Golden Retriever : The sun is shining, the day is young, we&apos;ve got our whole lives ahead of us, and you&apos;re inside worrying about a stupid burned-out bulb?

 Whippet : Throw it for me, throw it for me! Bet I can kill it before it hits the ground!

 Border Collie : Just one. And then I&apos;ll replace any wiring that&apos;s not up to code.

 Dachsund : You know I can&apos;t reach that stupid lamp! When are you going to stop making cracks about my height?

 Rottweiler : Make me.

 Doberman : Yeah. What the Rottweiler said. Make me.

 Boxer : Who cares? I can still play with my squeaky toys in the dark.

 Afghan Hound : Please! And muss my hair?

 Labrador Retriever : Oh, me, me!!! Pleeeeeeeeeze let me change the light bulb! Can I? Can I? Huh? Huh? Huh? Can I? Pleeeeeeeeeze, please, please, please!

 German Shepherd : I&apos;ll change it as soon as I&apos;ve led these people from the dark, checked to make sure I haven&apos;t missed any, and made just one more perimeter patrol to see that no one has tried to take advantage of the situation.

 Old English Sheepdog : Light bulb? I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t see a light bulb.

 Cocker Spaniel : Why change it? I can still pee on the carpet in the dark.

 Greyhound : It isn&apos;t moving. Who cares? Oops, gotta run!

 Chihuahua : Light bulb? We don&apos;t need no stinkin&apos; light bulb. How many times I gotta tell ya? Yo quiero Taco Bulb! 

 Collie : I have to drop a rope down the well to Timmy right now, but then I&apos;ll bring you an oil lamp to use til I can make an electrician understand that I need him to follow me home.

 Australian Shepherd : First, I&apos;ll get all the light bulbs in a little circle...

 Poodle : I&apos;ll just blow in the Border Collie&apos;s ear and he&apos;ll do it. By the time he finishes rewiring the house, my nails will be dry.

 Siberian Husky : Just pop it in the back of the sled. I&apos;ll get on it as soon as I&apos;ve done everything I want to do first.

 And finally, how many cats does it take to change a light bulb? 

 Cat : Cats do not change light bulbs. People change light bulbs. So, the real question is,&quot;How long will it be before I can expect some light, some dinner, and a massage?&quot;

 Which once again proves that while dogs have masters, cats have staff.

The bartender glares at him and says,&quot;I&apos;m not going to do that unless you ask nicely.&quot;

A few minutes later, the guy gets the bartender&apos;s attention and says,&quot;Look, come on, send the douche-bag a drink from me!&quot;Once again the bartender refuses.

Eventually the guy says to the bartender,&quot;Look, send her a drink! I really want to meet that douche-bag!&quot;The bartender says,&quot;Once and for all, I won&apos;t do it if you don&apos;t clean up your language.&quot;

So, the guy sighs and finally says,&quot;Okay, can you send that lovely lady whatever she&apos;s drinking and tell her it&apos;s from me?&quot;

Q: How many George W. Bush Administration officials does it take to screw in a light bulb?

A: None. There is nothing wrong with the light bulb; its condition is improving every day. Any reports of its lack of incandescence are totally unfounded, and the result of delusional&quot;spin&quot;assaults from the fanatic, elitist, liberal media. That light bulb has served honorably, and anything you say undermines the lighting effect and dims its ego. Why do you hate freedom? Re: Jokes and Humor

As far as the Challenger disaster is concerned I remember this one:

Q: Why do the engineers at NASA drink Coke?
A:&quot;Because they couldn&apos;t get 7Up.&quot;

This one is courtesy of Terry Pratchett, he told it yesterday at an event:

A man walks into a pub carrying an alligator under his arm. He puts the alligator down on the bar and says:&quot;Watch this. I bet you nobody will repeat this.&quot;He drops his trousers and inserts his privates into the alligator&apos;s mouth, then hits the alligator hard on the head. The jaws snap shut and there is awince from the man. Then he looks around and says:&quot;I bet nobody wants to repeat that. Any takers?&quot;A little lady at the back of the pub gets up and says:&quot;OK, I will do it, but you have to promise not to hit me too hard.&quot;

An officer pulls over a speeding car. The officer says,&quot;I clocked you at 80 miles per hour, sir.&quot;

The driver says,&quot;Gee, officer I had it on cruise control at 60,
perhaps your radar gun needs calibrating.&quot;

Not looking up from her knitting the wife says:&quot;Now don&apos;t be silly
dear, you know that this car doesn&apos;t have cruise control.&quot;

As the officer writes out the ticket, the driver looks over at his wife and growls,&quot;Can&apos;t you please keep you mouth shut for once?&quot;

The wife smiles demurely and says,&quot;You should be thankful your radar detector went off when it did.&quot;

As the officer makes out the second ticket for the illegal radar
detector unit, the man glowers at his wife and says through clenched teeth,&quot;Darn it, woman, can&apos;t you keep your mouth shut?&quot;

The officer frowns and says,&quot;And I notice that you&apos;re not wearing your seat belt, sir. That&apos;s an automatic $75 fine.&quot;

The driver says,&quot;Yeah, well, you see officer, I had it on, but took it off when you pulled me over so that I could get my license out of my back pocket.&quot;

The wife says,&quot;Now, dear, you know very well that you didn&apos;t have your seat belt on. You never wear your seat belt when you&apos;re driving.&quot;

And as the police officer is writing out the third ticket the driver
turns to his wife and barks,&quot;WHY DON&apos;T YOU PLEASE SHUT UP??&quot;

The officer looks over at the woman and asks,&quot;Does you husband always talk to you this way, Ma&apos;am?&quot;

&quot;Only when he&apos;s been drinking.&quot;

My Mom just sent me this one. It is cute:

Mike was going to be married to Karen, so his father sat him down for a little chat.

He said,&quot;Mike, let me tell you something. On my wedding night in our honeymoon suite I took off my pants, handed them to your mother, and said, &apos;Here--try these on.&apos;

She did and said, &apos;These are too big, I can&apos;t wear them.&apos;

I replied, &apos;Exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will.&apos; Ever since that night we have never had any problems.&quot;

Mike thought that might be a good thing to try, so on his honeymoon Mike took off his pants and said to Karen,&quot;Here, try these on.&quot;

She tried them on and said,&quot;These are too large. They don&apos;t fit me.&quot;

Mike said,&quot;Exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will. I don&apos;t want you to ever forget that.&quot;

Then Karen took off her pants and handed them to Mike. She said,&quot;Here-you try on mine.&quot;

He did and said,&quot;I can&apos;t get into your pants.&quot;

Karen said,&quot;Exactly. And if you don&apos;t change your smart-assed attitude, you never will.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

A commuter was on his way home from work one day and when he hit the freeway he noticed a tremendous amount of traffic, even moreso than usual. There were cars backed up for several miles. The commuter notices a guy walking down the shoulder. As the guy approaches his passenger side the commuter rolls down the passenger side window and asks the guy if he knew what was causing all the back up. The guy replied:

It was just announced over the radio that terrorists were holding George Bush and Dick Cheney hostage. He went on to explain that they were demanding 200 million dollars for their release, otherwise they were going to douse them with gasoline and set them on fire. The commuter asked what everyone else was donating.

The guy replied:

So far the everybody had pledged at least one gallon. Re: Jokes and Humor

This is one of my favourite jokes ever (and my debut in this thread )

A missionary is sent to the jungles of Africa, to work with a primitive tribe. He spends many years with them, teaching them to read, to write, and most of all the evils of sexual sins. He particularly stresses the evils of fornication and adultery. Then one day, the wife of the tribal chief gives birth - to a white child! The Chief didn&apos;t just fall off the turnip truck, so he knows what&apos;s up. He rushes off to confront the missionary.
&quot;You teach us the evils of these sins, yet a black woman gives birth to a white child - and you are the only white man to ever set foot in our tribe! I know what&apos;s going on!&quot;
&quot;No, no, good man&quot;, says the missionary,&quot;what has happened is a natural occurance - what is called an albino. Look into the field - see the field full of white sheep, yet among them is one black one. Nature does this on occasion.&quot;
The Chief pauses for a moment, and then says:
&quot;I&apos;ll make you a deal - you don&apos;t mention the sheep, I won&apos;t mention the kid.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

Johnny&apos;s Dirty Mouth


A kindergarten teacher is in front of her class. It&apos;s Parents Day, and all the parents are observing the class. To show how smart the kids are, the teacher has come up with an alphabet exercise. She is going to call out a letter, and ask the students to give her a word that starts with that letter. She is a bit worried about Johnny, however, since he has an extremely filthy mouth.

&quot;Who can give me a word that starts with the letter &apos;A&apos;?&quot;

Johnny jumps out of his seat and raises his hand. The teacher thinks to herself,&quot;Johhny will probably say &apos;asshole&apos;, so I shouldn&apos;t call on him.&quot;She calls on Mary instead.

&quot;Apple!&quot;Mary says.

&quot;Very good, Mary. How about &apos;B&apos;?&quot;

Johnny&apos; s up again. The teacher assumes he&apos;ll say&quot;bitch&quot;and calls on Timmy.

&quot;Baseball!&quot;says Timmy.

&quot;Excellent! Who knows a C word?&quot;

Johnny is apoplectic, standing on his chair, waving his hand. There is NO WAY in HELL the teacher is calling on Johnny for&quot;C&quot;!

Bobby supplies&quot;cranberry&quot;, and things progress through the alphabet. The teacher is getting nervous, because she keeps ignoring Johnny, and his parents are getting suspicious. It&apos;s just that she is sure he will have a filthy word for every letter.

Eventually they get to the letter&quot;R&quot;, and the teacher can&apos;t think of a dirty word that begins with&quot;R&quot;, so she finally calls on Johnny.

Johnny triumphantly stands up and says&quot;Rat!&quot;

The teacher is stunned. She says,&quot;That&apos;s your word? Rat?&quot;

Johnny, holding his hands aboout 18 inches apart says,&quot;Yeah, a big fuckin&apos; rat with a dick like THIS!&quot;




I love that joke so much, if someone just says&quot;A big fuckin&apos; rat&quot;to me I will laugh.

I once had a friend absolutely kill me with this one (competely deadpan of course):

Q: Why did the 5th monkey fall out of the tree?
A: Because it was dead.

See? You expect escalation in the monkey joke at that point, and he nails me by going back to the beginning. He told me the first monkey joke our freshman year, and they&apos;d get trotted out periodically. I swear, I thought I invented&quot;peer pressure&quot;when we were seniors. Either it was funnier than I thought, or I picked it up somewhere without realizing it, which is more likely, I guess.... Re: Jokes and Humor

CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL

(supposedly) This is a true phone call from the Word Perfect Help line which was transcribed from a Recording monitoring the customer care department. Needless to say the HelpDesk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing the WordPerfect organization for&quot;Termination without Cause.&quot;This is actual Dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee. Now we know why they record these conversations!

&quot;Ridge Hall computer assistance; may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, I&apos;m having trouble with WordPerfect.&quot;

&quot;What sort of trouble?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.&quot;

&quot;Went away?&quot;

&quot;They disappeared.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. So what does your scre en look like now?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

&quot;Nothing?&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s blank, it won&apos;t accept anything when I type.&quot;

&quot;Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?&quot;

&quot;How do I tell?&quot;

&quot;Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s a sea-prompt?&quot;

&quot;Never mind, can you move your cursor around the screen?&quot;

&quot;There isn&apos;t any cursor: I told you, it won&apos;t accept anything I type.&quot;

&quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator?&quot;

&quot;What&apos;s a monitor?&quot;

&quot;It&apos;s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it&apos;s on?&quot;

&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;

&quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;

&quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it&apos;s plugged into the wall.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot;

&quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.&quot;

&quot;Okay, here it is.&quot;

&quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it&apos;s plugged securely into the back of your computer.&quot;

&quot;I can&apos;t reach.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&apos;s not because I don&apos;t have the right angle -- it&apos;s because it&apos;s dark.&quot;

&quot;Dark?&quot;

&quot;Yes, the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.&quot;

&quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot;

&quot;I can&apos;t.&quot;

&quot;No? Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because there&apos;s a power failure.&quot;

&quot;A power... A power failure? Aha, Okay, we&apos;ve got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot;

&quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot;

&quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&apos;m afraid it is.&quot;

&quot;Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?&quot;

&quot;Tell them you&apos;re too f*cking stupid to own a computer.&quot;

A lady walked into a veterinary clinic one day carrying a very limp little duck. She put the duck on the table and asked,&quot;What&apos;s wrong with my him?&quot;.
The vet briefly looked at the duck and said&quot;I&apos;m sorry but your duck is dead&quot;.
The lady said&quot;How can this be? You barely even looked at him ! You didn&apos;t run any tests or anything! I want another opinion!&quot;.

Then vet looked at the lady and said&quot;very well&quot;and walked out of the room. A minute later he returns with a Labrador Retriever dog. The dog jumped on the table, sniffed the duck from head to tail, then looked at the vet and sadly shook his head. Then the vet left again , this time returning with a cat. The cat did likewise. He jumped on the table, sniffed the duck, sadly shook his head and walked out.
So the vet asked the lady&quot;So now what do you think?&quot;.
She replied,&quot;Well I guess after all that my duck really is dead&quot;.

Then the vet handed her the bill. The lady was shocked&quot;How can you charge me this much to tell me that my duck is dead!&quot;.
&quot;Well&quot;, the vet said,&quot;If you would have just stopped at my examination it would have only come to $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan the bill came to $200&quot;. Re: Jokes and Humor

 Excerpts from a Cat&apos;s Daily Diary.... 
Day 683 of my captivity: My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the floor.

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrat es what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a&quot;good little hunter&quot;I am . The audacity! There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of&quot;allergies.&quot;I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow -- but at the top of the stairs. I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released -- and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously Palin! The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. The captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe....... for now.... Re: Jokes and Humor

The Letter:

There was a man who worked for the Post Office whose job it was to process all the mail that had illegible addresses.

One day, a letter came addressed in a shaky handwriting to God with no actual address. He thought he should open it to see what it was about.

The letter read:

&quot;Dear God,

I am an 83 year old widow, living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had $100 in it, which was all the money I had until my next pension check.

Next Sunday is Christmas, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope.

Can you please help me?

Sincerely,
Edna&quot;

The postal worker was touched. He showed the letter to all the other workers. Each one dug into his or her wallet and came up with a few dollars.By the time he made the rounds, he had collected $96, which they put into an envelope and sent to the woman. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of Edna and the dinner she would be able to share with her friends.

Christmas came and went.

A few days later, another letter came from the same old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.

It read,

&quot;Dear God,

How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to fix a glorious dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day and I told my friends of your wonderful gift.

By the way, there was $4 missing.

I think it must have been those bastards at the Post Office.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

This is for all the Greecies in the Pregnancy thread. 

A married couple went to the hospital have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mothers labor pain to the babys father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.

The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husbands blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing.

At this point, they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.




 When they got home, they found the mailman dead on the porch.

From The Lady Bunny:

A sailor meets a pirate in a bar, and talk turns to their adventures.
The sailor notes that the pirate has a peg leg, a hook hand, and an eye patch.

&quot;How did you end up with a peg leg?&quot;he asks.

&quot;I was swept overboard into a school of sharks,&quot;the pirate replies.&quot;As my men were pulling me out, a shark bit off my leg.&quot;

&quot;Wow!&quot;cries the sailor.&quot;What about your hook?&quot;

&quot;Argh! An enemy hacked off my hand during a raid.&quot;

&quot;Incredible! How&apos;d you get the eye patch?&quot;

&quot;A seagull pooped in my eye.&quot;

&quot;You lost your eye to a sea gull dropping?&quot;

Annual Stella Lawsuit Awards

One can only hope that it is indeed ......
Only in the USA

The Annual Stella Lawsuit Awards

Time once again to review the winners of the Annual&quot;Stella Lawsuit Awards.&quot;The Stella Awards are named after 81 year-old Stella Liebeck, who spilled hot coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonald&apos;s (in NM). That case Inspired the Stella Lawsuit Awards for the most frivolous, ridiculous, stupid, but successful lawsuits in the United States .

Here are this year&apos;s winners.......

5th Place (tie):
Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $80,000, by a jury of her peers, after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson&apos;s own son.

5th Place (tie):
19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn&apos;t notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal the car&apos;s hubcaps.

5th Place (tie):
Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing, by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn&apos;t re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner&apos;s insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed, to the tune of $500,000. In my opinion, this is so outrageous that it should have been 2nd place!

4th Place :
Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door
neighbor&apos;s beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner&apos;s fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams, who had climbed over the fence into the yard and was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.

3rd Place :
A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.

2nd Place :
Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.

1st Place :
This year&apos;s runaway winner was Mrs. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Mrs. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot Winnebago motor home. On her first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, she set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the driver&apos;s seat to go into the back to make herself a sandwich. Not surprisingly, the RV left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mrs. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising her in the owner&apos;s manual that she couldn&apos;t actually do this. The jury awarded her $1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other total morons around.

I know, but the Winnegabo one could have happened (with my mom - shhh.)

 

ETA:

Two old ladies are outside their nursing home, having a drink and a smoke, when it starts to rain. One of the old ladies pulls out a condom, cuts off the end, puts it over her cigarette, and continues smoking.
Maude: What in the hell is that?
Mabel: A condom. This way my cigarette doesn&apos;t get wet.
Maude: Where did you get it?
Mabel: You can get them at any drugstore.
The next day, Maude hobbles herself into the local drugstore and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms.
The pharmacist, obviously embarrassed, looks at her kind of strangely (she is after all, over 80 years of age), but very delicately asks what brand of condom she prefers.
&quot;Doesn&apos;t matter Sonny, as long as it fits on a Camel.&quot;
The pharmacist fainted. Re: Jokes and Humor

Grandma&apos;s boyfriend


A 5 yr old boy went to visit his grandmother one day.

While playing with his toys in her bedroom while
Grandma was dusting, he looked up and said,
&quot;Grandma, how come you don&apos;t have a boyfriend?&quot;

Grandma replied,&quot;Honey, my TV is my boyfriend.
I can sit in my bedroom and watch it all day long.
The TV evangelists keep me company and make me feel
so good. The comedies make me laugh. I&apos;m really happy
with the TV as my boyfriend.&quot;

Grandma turned on the TV and the reception was terrible.
She started adjusting the knobs, trying to get the picture in focus.
Frustrated, she finally started hitting the backside of the TV,
hoping to fix the problem.

The little boy heard the doorbell ring, so he hurried to open
the door, and there stood a man.

The man said,&quot;Hello, son, is your grandma home..?&quot;

The little boy replied,&quot;Yeah, but she&apos;s in the bedroom banging her boyfriend.&quot;

Grandma&apos;s minister fainted.

A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was squirming around, scratching his crotch, and not paying attention. She went back to find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and whispered that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite itchy.

The teacher told him to go down to the principal&apos;s office. He was to telephone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did it and returned to his class. Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the room She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his penis hanging out.

&quot;I thought I told you to call your Mom!&quot;she said.

I don&apos;t usually like these heartwarming stories, but this one is truly
interesting...

In 1986, Mkele Mbembe was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from
the University of Chicago. On a hike through the bush, he came across a
young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The
elephant seemed distressed, so Mbembe approached it very carefully. He
got down on one knee and inspected the elephant&apos;s foot and found a large
piece of wood deeply embedded in it.

As carefully and as gently as he could, Mbembe worked the wood out with
his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly p ut down its foot.

The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on
its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Mbembe stood frozen,
thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant
trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.

Mbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Mbembe was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his
teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the
creatures turned and walked over to near where Mbembe and his son Tapu
were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Mbembe, lifted its
front foot off t he ground, then put it down. The elephant did that
several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn&apos;t help wondering if
this was the same elephant.

Mbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way
into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared
back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around
one of Mbembe&apos;s legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him
instantly.

Probably wasn&apos;t the same elephant.

Snow White came out of the Guiness offices with a big smile&quot;They confirmed it, I am the fairest in the land&quot;

Tom Thumb came out of the Guiness offices with an equally big smile,&quot;They confirmed that I, indeed, am the smallest person in the land&quot;

(A little gem I unearthed from my old email inbox, from about five years ago.....)



This story happened about a month ago in a little town in Mexico, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, it&apos;s real.

This guy was on the side of the road hitch hiking on a very dark night and in the middle of a storm. The hour was late and no cars went by, the storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him.

Suddenly he saw a car coming towards him and stop. The guy without thinking about it gets in the car and closes the door, just to realize there&apos;s nobody behind the wheel. The car starts slowly, the guy looks at the road and sees a curve coming his way. Scared, he starts to pray begging for his life. In terror, he watches when just before he hits the curve, a hand appears through the window and moves the wheel. The guy, paralyzed in terror, watched how the hand appears every time they are before a curve.

The guy, gathering strength, jumps out of the car and runs to the nearest town. Wet and in shock, he goes to a cantina and asks for two shots of tequila, and starts telling everybody about the horrible experience he went through. A silence envelopes the crowd when they realize the guy was crying and wasn&apos;t
drunk.

About half an hour later two guys walk in the same cantina and one says to the other,&quot;Look Pepe, that&apos;s the jerk that got in the car when we were pushing it.&quot;

Hee hee! Too true.

This is truly a heartwarming story about the bond formed between a little girl and some construction workers. This story will make you want to believe in the goodness of people and believe there is hope for the human race.

A young family moved into a house next door to a vacant lot. One day a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot. The young family&apos;s 6-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and started talking with the workers. She hung around and eventually the construction crew, gems-in-the-rough all of them, more or less adopted her as a kind of project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important.

At the end of the first week they even presented her with a pay envelope containing a dollar. The little girl took this home to her mother who said all the appropriate words of admiration and suggested that they take the dollar pay she had received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.

When they got to the bank the teller was equally impressed with the story and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age. The little girl proudly replied,&quot;I&apos;ve been working with a crew building a house all week.&quot;

&quot;My goodness gracious,&quot;said the teller,&quot;and will you be working on the house again this week too?&quot;The little girl replied,&quot;I will if those useless sons of bitches at the lumber yard ever bring us any fucking drywall that&apos;s worth a shit.&quot;

For several years, a man was having an affair with an Italian woman. One night, she confided in him that she was pregnant. Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to secretly have the child.

If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write&quot;Spaghetti&quot;on the back. He would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.

One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife.&quot;Honey,&quot;she said,&quot;you received a very strange post card today.&quot;&quot;Oh, just give it to me and I&apos;ll explain it later,&quot;he said. The wife obeyed and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted.

On the card was written:

&quot;Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Three with meatballs, two without. Send extra sauce.&quot;

Jesus and Satan were having an on-going argument about who was better
on the computer. They had been going at it for days, and frankly God was
tired of hearing all the bickering.

Finally fed up, God said,&quot;THAT&apos;S IT! I have had enough. I am going to set up a test that will run for two hours, and from those results, I will judge who does the better job.&quot;

So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away.

They moused.

They faxed.

They e-mailed.

They e-mailed with attachments.

They downloaded.

They did spreadsheets!

They wrote reports.

They created labels and cards.

They created charts and graphs.

They did some genealogy reports

They did every job known to man.

Jesus worked with heavenly efficiency and Satan was faster than hell.

Then, ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, rain poured, and, of course, the power went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld.

Jesus just sighed.

Finally the electricity came back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming:

&quot;It&apos;s gone! It&apos;s all GONE!&quot;I lost everything when the power went
out!&quot;

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from
the past two hours of work.

Satan observed this and became irate.

&quot;Wait!&quot;he screamed.&quot;That&apos;s not fair! He cheated! How come he has all his work and I don&apos;t have any?&quot;

God just shrugged and said,

WHY MEN DO NOT WRITE ADVICE COLUMNS

Dear Walter:

I hope you can help me here. The other day I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn&apos;t gone more than a few hundred yards down the road when my engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband&apos;s help.

When I got home I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. He was parading in front of the wardrobe mirror dressed in my underwear and high-heel shoes, and he was wearing my make up.

I am 32, my husband is 34 and we have been married for twelve years. When I confronted him, he tried to make out that he had dressed in my lingerie because he couldn&apos;t find his own underwear. But when I asked him about the make up, he broke down and admitted that he&apos;d been wearing my clothes for six months. I told him to stop or I would leave him.

He was let go from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. I don&apos;t feel I can get through to him anymore. Can you please help?

Sincerely,

Mrs. Sheila Lusk


Dear Sheila:

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the jubilee clips holding the vacuum pipes onto the inlet manifold. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the carburetor float chamber. I hope this helps.

Walter

I don&apos;t know if this is real, but it&apos;s so funny that I want to pass it on anyway. I want Mr. G to remember that I could also be considered&quot;an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.&quot;
 
This is an actual letter sent to Proctor and Gamble from Wendi Aarons, Austin, TX, regarding their feminine products. She really gets rolling after the first paragraph...

 Dear Mr. Thatcher,

I have been a loyal user of your Always Maxi Pads for over 20 years and I appreciate many of their features. Why, without the Leak GuardCore(tm) or Dri-Weave(tm) absorbency, I&apos;d probably never go horseback riding or salsa dancing, and I&apos;d certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in tight, white shorts. But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary Flexi-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can&apos;t tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there&apos;s a little F-16 in my pants.

Have you ever had a period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from&quot;the curse&quot;? I&apos;m guessing you haven&apos;t.

Well, my&quot;time of the month&quot;is starting right now. As I type, I can already feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes from now, my body will adjust and I&apos;ll be transformed into what my husband likes to call&quot;an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.&quot;

As Brand Manager in the Feminine-hygiene Division, you&apos;ve no doubt seen quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers&apos; monthly visits from&quot;Aunt Flo&quot;. Therefore, you must know about the bloating, puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, crying, and out-of-control behavior. You surely realize it&apos;s a tough time for most women.

The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just crawling with homicidal maniacs in Capri pants... which brings me to the reason for my letter.

Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi-pad, and there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words:&quot;Have a Happy Period.&quot;

Are you f__king kidding me? Does any part of your tiny middle-manager brain really think happiness - actual smiling, laughing happiness is possible during a period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit pleasurable? Well, did it, James? FYI, unless you&apos;re some kind of sick S&amp;M;freak girl, there will never be anything&quot;happy&quot;about a day in which you have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your house just so you don&apos;t march down to the local K-mart armed with a hunting rifle and as ketchy plan to end our life in a blaze of glory.

For the love of God, if you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi pad, wouldn&apos;t it make more sense to say something that&apos;s actually pertinent, like&quot;Put Down the Hammer&quot;or&quot;Vehicular Manslaughter Is Wrong&quot;, or are you just picking on us?

Sir, please inform your Accounting Department that, effective immediately, there will be an $8 drop in monthly profits, for I have chosen to take my maxi-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly miss your Flex-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of condescending bull s__t. And that&apos;s a promise I will keep.

I shall take you to bed and have my way with you.
I will make you ache, shake and sweat until you moan and groan.
I will make you beg for mercy, beg for me to stop.
I will exhaust you to the point that you will be relieved when I&apos;m finished with you.

A priest, a Pentecostal preacher, and a rabbi all served a small northern community. They would get together two or three times a week for coffee and to talk shop.

One day, someone made the comment that preaching to people isn&apos;t really all that hard. A real challenge would be to preach to a bear. One thing led to another, and they decided to do an experiment. They would all go out into the woods, find a bear, preach to it, and attempt to convert it. Seven days later, they all came together to discuss their experience.

Father Flannery, who had his arm in a sling, was on crutches, and had various bandages on his body and limbs, went first.&quot;Well,&quot;he said,&quot;I went into the woods to find me a bear. And when I found him, I began to read to him from the Catechism. Well, that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around. So I quickly grabbed my holy water, sprinkled him and, Holy Mary Mother of God, he became as gentle as a lamb.
The bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation.&quot;

Reverend Billy Bob spoke next. He was in a wheelchair, had one arm and both legs in casts, and had an IV drip. In his best fire-and-brimstone oratory, he claimed,&quot;WELL, brothers, you KNOW that we don&apos;t sprinkle! I went out and I FOUND me a bear. And then I began to read to my bear from God&apos;s HOLY WORD! But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took HOLD of him and we began to wrestle. We wrestled down one hill, UP another and DOWN another until we came to a creek. So I quickly DUNKED him and BAPTIZED his hairy soul. And just like you said, he became as gentle as a lamb. We spent the rest of the day praising Jesus.&quot;

The priest and the preacher both looked down at the rabbi, who was lying in a hospital bed. He was in a body cast and traction with IVs and monitors running in and out of him. He was in really bad shape. The Rabbi looked up and said,&quot;Looking back on it, circumcision may not have been the best way to start.&quot;

A woman went to her doctor. The doctor, after an examination, sighed and said,&quot;I&apos;ve some bad news. You have cancer, and you&apos;d best put your affairs in order.&quot;

The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the waiting room where her daughter had been waiting.&quot;Well daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things don&apos;t go so well. In this case, things aren&apos;t well. I have terminal cancer. Let&apos;s head to the club and have a martini.&quot;

After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the woman&apos;s old friends, who were curious as to what the two were celebrating. The woman told her friends they were drinking to her impending end.&quot;I&apos;ve been diagnosed with AIDS.&quot;The friends were aghast and gave the woman their condolences.

After the friends left, the woman&apos;s daughter leaned over and whispered,&quot;Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you just told your friends you were dying of AIDS.&quot;The woman said,&quot;I don&apos;t want any of those bitches sleeping with your father after I&apos;m gone.&quot;

The golf accident...

Two women were playing golf. One teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. The ball hit one of the men. He immediately clasped his Hands together at his groin, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony.

The woman rushed down to the man, and immediately began to apologize.

&apos;Please allow me to help. I&apos;m a Physical Therapist and I know I
could relieve your pain if you&apos;d allow me,&apos;she told him.
&apos;Oh, no, I&apos;ll be all right. I&apos;ll be fine in a few minutes,&apos; the
man replied.

He was in obvious agony, lying in the fetal position, still clasping his hands together at his groin.

At her persistence, however, he finally allowed her to help.

She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side,
loosened his pants and put her hands inside.
She administered tender and artful massage for several long
moments and asked,&apos;How does that feel&apos;?

He replied:
&apos;It feels great, but I still think my thumb&apos;s broken.&apos; Re: Jokes and Humor

HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO MARRY?
You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming. -
Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who they&apos;re going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you&apos;re stuck with. -
Kirsten, age 10

WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?
Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then. -
Camille, age 10

No age is good to get married at. You got to be a fool to get married.
Freddie, age 6

HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?
You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at the same kids. - Derrick, age 8

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?
Both don&apos;t want any more kids. -
Lori, age 8

WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?
Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough. -
Lynnette, age 8

On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. -
Martin, age10

WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?
I&apos;d run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns. -
Craig, age 9

WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?
When they&apos;re rich. -
Pam, age 7

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn&apos;t want to mess with that. -
Curt, age 7

The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should marry them and have kids with them. It&apos;s the right thing to do. -
Howard, age 8

IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?
It&apos;s better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them. - Anita, age 9

HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN&apos;T GET MARRIED?
There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn&apos;t there? -
Kelvin, age 8

HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?
Tell your wife that she looks pretty even if she looks like a truck.
Ricky, age 10

Tomato Garden

An old Italian man lived alone in New Jersey. He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, as the ground was hard.

His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:

Dear Vincent,
I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won&apos;t be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I&apos;m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.
Love, Papa

A few days later he received a letter from his son:

Dear Pop,
Don&apos;t dig up that garden. That&apos;s where the bodies are buried.
Love, Vinnie

At 4 a.m. the next morning FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left.

That same day the old man received another letter from his son:

Dear Pop,
Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That&apos;s the best I could do under the circumstances.
Love you, Vinnie

A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath.

&quot;Nurse,&quot;he mumbles, from behind the mask.&quot;Are my testicles black?&quot;

Embarrassed, the young nurse replies,&quot;I don&apos;t know, sir. I&apos;m only here to wash your upper body and feet.&quot;

He struggles to ask again,&quot;Nurse, please check. Are my testicles black?&quot;

Concerned that he may elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worry about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles in the other. She takes a close look and says,&quot;There&apos;s nothing wrong with them, sir!&quot;

The man pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her and says very slowly,&quot;Thank you very much. That was wonderful, but, listen very, very closely.....

Two 90-year-old women, Vivian and Edith, had been friends all of their lives. When it was clear that Edith was dying, Vivian visited her every day.

One day Vivian said,&quot;Edith, we both loved playing women&apos;s softball all our lives, and we played in all through high school. Please do me one favor: when you get to Heaven, somehow you must let me know if there&apos;s women&apos;s softball there.&quot;

Edith looked up at Vivian from her death bed,&quot;Vivian, you&apos;ve been my best friend for many years. If it&apos;s at all possible, I&apos;ll do this favor for you.&quot;

Shortly after that, Edith passed on.

At midnight a couple of nights later, Vivian was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to her,&quot;Vivian, Vivian.&quot;

&quot;Who is it?&quot;asked Vivian, sitting up suddenly.&quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;Vivian -- it&apos;s me, Edith.&quot;

&quot;You&apos;re not Edith. Edith died.&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m telling you, Vivian, it&apos;s me,&quot;insisted the voice.

&quot;Edith! Where are you?&quot;

&quot;In Heaven,&quot;replied Edith.&quot;I have some really good news and a little bad news.&quot;

&quot;Tell me the good news first,&quot;said Vivian.

&quot;The good news,&quot;Edith said,&quot;is that there&apos;s softball in Heaven. Better yet, all of our old buddies who died before us are here, too. Better than that, we&apos;re all young again. Better still, it&apos;s always springtime, and it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play softball all we want, and we never get tired.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s fantastic,&quot;said Vivian.&quot;It&apos;s beyond my wildest dreams! So what&apos;s the bad news?&quot;

In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya. He came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully.

He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant&apos;s foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one turned and walked over to where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter couldn&apos;t help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter&apos;s legs and slammed his stupid ass against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn&apos;t the same elephant.

This is for all of my friends who send me those heart-warming stories. Re: Jokes and Humor

Taken from the recent Comedy issue of Rolling Stone.

Robin Williams&apos; favorite joke:

&quot;Guy&apos;s having sex with his wife. All of a sudden he looks over, and there in the doorway is his son, about eight years old. Kid looks horrified, and the kid runs away. The guy says to his wife, &apos;Well, I&apos;d better talk to Timmy.&apos;

He puts on his clothes and goes to Timmy&apos;s room. He opens the door , and there&apos;s Timmy nailing Grandma. The father goes &apos;Oh, my God!&apos; And the kid goes, &apos;Not so funny when it&apos;s your mom, is it?&apos;&quot;

A cabbie picks up a nun.

She gets into the cab, and notices that the VERY handsome cab driver won&apos;t stop staring at her.

She asks him why he is staring.

He replies:&quot;I have a question to ask you but I don&apos;t want to offend you.&quot;

She answers,&quot;My son, you cannot offend me. When you&apos;re as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I&apos;m sure that there&apos;s nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&apos;ve always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.&quot;

She responds,&quot;Well, let&apos;s see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be single and #2, you must be Catholic.&quot;

The cab driver is very excited and says,&quot;Yes, I&apos;m single and Catholic!&quot;

&quot;OK&quot;the nun says.&quot;Pull into the next alley.&quot;

The nun fulfills his fantasy, with a kiss that would make a hooker blush.

But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying.

&quot;My dear child,&quot;says the nun,&quot;why are you crying?&quot;

&quot;Forgive me but I&apos;ve sinned. I lied and I must confess, I&apos;m married and I&apos;m Jewish.&quot;

The nun says,&quot;That&apos;s OK. My name is Kevin and I&apos;m going to a Halloween party.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

A man and a woman, who had never met before, but who were both married to other people, found themselves assigned to the same sleeping room on a transcontinental train.

Though initially embarrassed and uneasy about sharing a room, they were both very tired and soon managed to fall asleep... he in the upper bunk and she in the lower.

At 1:00 AM, the man leaned over and gently woke the woman saying,&quot;Ma&apos;am, I&apos;m sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet and hand me a second blanket? I&apos;m awfully cold.&quot;

&quot;I have a better idea,&quot;the woman groggily replied.&quot;Just for tonight, let&apos;s pretend we&apos;re married.&quot;

&quot;Wow! That&apos;s a great idea!&quot;the man exclaimed.

&quot;Good,&quot;she replied.&quot;Get your own fuckin&apos; blanket!&quot;

After a moment of silence, he farted. Re: Jokes and Humor

A woman who apparently likes to go commando, decides to get a tattoo of Elvis on her inner thigh. Much to the chagrin of the tattoo artist, our lady decided to wear a skirt that day.

Unfortunately, she is not happy with the first Elvis, and decides to have another Elvis tattooed on her other inner thigh. Finally! The artist gets his money and the woman leaves.

Still not sure if she&apos;s happy with her Elvises, the woman finds an wino sitting on a curb nearby and asks him to give her his honest opinion of what he sees on her thighs. Squinting, the old man looks from thigh to thigh and says&quot;I&apos;m not sure about the two tattoos but the one in the middle looks like Willie Nelson.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

Copied from a nursing forum:

In a Chicago Hospital, a gentleman had made several attempts to get into the men&apos;s restroom, but it had always been occupied. A nurse noticed his predicament.

&quot;Sir,&quot;she said.&quot;You may use the ladies room if you promise not to touch any of the buttons on the wall.&quot;

He did what he needed to, and as he sat there, he noticed the buttons he had promised not to touch. Each button was identified by letters: WW , WA , PP20 and a red one labeled ATR. Who would know if he touched them? He couldn&apos;t resist.. He pushed WW. Warm water was sprayed gently upon his bottom.

What a nice feeling, he thought. Men&apos;s restrooms don&apos;t have nice things like this. Anticipating greater pleasure, he pushed the WA button. Warm air replaced the warm water, gently drying his underside.

When this stopped, he pushed the PP button. A large powder puff caressed his bottom adding a fragile scent of spring flower to this unbelievable pleasure. The ladies restroom was more than a restroom - it is tender loving pleasure.

When the powder puff completed its pleasure, he couldn&apos;t wait to push the ATR button, which he knew would be supreme ecstasy.

Next thing he knew, he opened his eyes, he was in a hospital bed, and a nurse was staring down at him.

&quot;What happened?&quot;he exclaimed.&quot;The last thing I remember was pushing the ATR button.&quot;

&quot;The button ATR is an Automatic Tampon Remover. Your penis is under your pillow.&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

Heard this from my Social Psych. Prof.

A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar. After an hour of gathering up his courage, he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively,&quot;Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?&quot;

She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs,&quot;NO! I won&apos;t sleep with you tonight!&quot;Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. Mortified the guy skulks back to his table.

After a while, the woman walks over to him and apologizes, saying&quot;Sorry about that. You see, I&apos;m a social psychology graduate student, and I&apos;m studying how people respond to embarrassing situations.&quot;

To which he responds, at the top of his lungs,&quot;What do you mean $200?!&quot;

 How to Waterproof a Cigarette
 
Joanne and Sandie are outside their nursing home, having a drink and a smoke, when it starts to rain. Joanne pulls out a condom, cuts off the end, puts it over her cigarette and continues smoking.

Sandie: What in the hell is that?

Joanne: A condom - this way my cigarette doesn&apos;t get wet.

Sandie: Where did you get it?

Joanne: You can get them at any drugstore.

The next day, Sandie hobbles herself into the local drugstore and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms.

The pharmacist, slightly embarrassed, looks at Sandie kindly (she is, after all, over 80 years of age) and very delicately asks what brand of condom she prefers.

&apos;Doesn&apos;t matter Sonny, as long as it fits on a Camel.&apos;

A guy getting ready for church can&apos;t find his hat anywhere. He knows on Monday he&apos;ll be expected to wear a hat to work so he comes up with a plan to steal someone else&apos;s hat from the cloak room at church. That Sunday the preacher gives a sermon on The Ten Commandments.

After church the rest of the congregation leaves but the man waits behind to talk to the preacher.

He says: Ya know Reverend, I had come here today with the intent of stealing someone else&apos;s hat from the cloak room. But your sermon made me change my mind.

Says the Preacher: Ah. I see. When I got to the part about &apos;Thou Shalt Not Steal&apos; you realized what a terrible sin it would be to take something that was not yours.

Dave and his buddies were hanging out and planning an upcoming fishing trip. Unfortunately, he had to tell them that he couldn&apos;t go this time because his wife wouldn&apos;t let him. After a lot of teasing and name calling, Dave headed home frustrated.

The following week when Dave&apos;s buddies arrived at the lake to set up camp, they were shocked to see Dave. He was already sitting at the campground with a cold beer, swag rolled out, fishing rod in hand, and a camp fire glowing.&quot;How did you talk your missus into letting you go Dave?&quot;

&quot;I didn&apos;t have to,&quot;Dave replied.&quot;Yesterday, when I left work, I went home and slumped down in my chair with a beer to drown my sorrows because I couldn&apos;t go fishing. Then the ol&apos; lady snuck up behind me, covered my eyes and said, &apos;Surprise&apos;.&quot;

So The Who were having a problem in their hotel suite. While everyone was trying to get some sleep, the lead singer was starting to freak out, throwing furniture around and threatening the other members of the band. Slowly they came to the realization that he&apos;d gone loco, so they jumped on him, tied him up with the bedsheets to restrain him and then took him down to the hospital for a psychiatric analysis.

&quot;Yep,&quot;said the doctor,&quot;he&apos;s bats, all right.&quot;

&quot;You&apos;ve got to do something!&quot;exclaimed the other members of the band.&quot;Check him into the rubber room, innit?&quot;

&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t do that,&quot;said the doctor with a sad look in his eye.

A woman was very distraught at the fact that she had not had a date or any sex in quite some time. She was afraid she might have something wrong with her, so she decided to seek the medical expertise of a sex therapist- Her doctor recommended that she see the well known Chinese sex therapist Dr. Chang.

So she went to see him. Upon entering the examination room Dr. Chang said &apos;OK take off all your crose.&apos;
The woman did as she was told. &apos;Now get down and craw reery, reery fass to odderside of room.&apos;
Again the woman did as she was instructed.. Dr. Chang then said &apos;OK, now craw reery, reery fass back to me.&apos; So she did.

Dr.Chang shook his head slowly and said, &apos;Your probrem vewy bad. You haf Ed Zachary disease.
Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or dates.&apos;
Worried the woman asked anxiously, &apos;Oh my God Dr.Chang what is Ed Zachary Disease?&apos;

Someone e-mailed me this:

THE GOOD NAPKINS

My mother taught me to read when I was four years old (her first mistake). One day, I was in the bathroom and noticed one of the cabinet doors was ajar. I read the box in the cabinet. I then asked my mother why she was keeping&quot;napkins&quot;in the bathroom. Didn&apos;t they belong in the kitchen?

Not wanting to burden me with unnecessary facts, she told me that those were for&quot;special occasions&quot;(her second mistake).

Now fast forward a few months...It&apos;s Thanksgiving Day, and my folks are leaving to pick up my uncle and his wife for dinner. Mom had assignments for all of us while they were gone. Mine was to set the table (her third mistake).

When they returned, my uncle came in first and immediately burst into laughter. Next came his wife, who gasped, then, began giggling. Next came my father, who roared with laughter. Then came Mom, who almost died of embarrassment when she saw each place setting on the table with a&quot;special occasion&quot;Kotex napkin at each plate, with the fork carefully arranged on top. I had even tucked the little tail in so they didn&apos;t hang off the edge!

My mother asked me why I used these and, of course, my response sent the other adults into further fits of laughter.

&quot;But, Mom, you said they were for special occasions!&quot; Re: Jokes and Humor

Her bad tempered old man is famous for upsetting foreigners with racist comments. A shopkeeper blames him for ordering the murder of his son and his son&apos;s girlfriend, but nothing has been proved yet.

All their kids have broken marriages except the youngest, who everyone thought was gay.

John went to visit his 90 year old grandfather in a very secluded, rural area of Saskatchewan.

After spending a great evening chatting the night away, the next morning John&apos;s grandfather prepared breakfast of bacon, eggs and toast.

However, John noticed a film like substance on his plate, and questioned his grandfather asking, &apos;Are these plates clean?&apos;

His grandfather replied, &apos;They&apos;re as clean as cold water can get em. Just you go ahead and finish your meal, Sonny!&apos;

For lunch the old man made hamburgers. Again, John was concerned about the plates, as his appeared to have tiny specks around the edge that looked like dried egg and asked, &apos;Are you sure these plates are clean?&apos; Without looking up the old man said, &apos;I told you before, Sonny, those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them. Now don&apos;t you fret, I don&apos;t want to hear another word about it!&apos;

Later that afternoon, John was on his way to a nearby town and as he was leaving, his grandfather&apos;s dog started to growl, and wouldn&apos;t let him pass.

John yelled and said, &apos;Grandfather, your dog won&apos;t let me get to my car&apos;.

As a bagpiper, I play many gigs. Recently I was asked by a funeral director to play at a grave side service for a homeless man. He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper&apos;s cemetery in the back-country.

As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost. I finally arrived an hour late.... and saw the funeral guy was evidently gone, and the hearse was nowhere in sight.

There were only the diggers and crew left.... and they were eating lunch. I felt badly and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down. The vault lid was already in place. I didn&apos;t know what else to do, so I started to play.

The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I&apos;ve never played before for this homeless man.

And as I played &apos;Amazing Grace&apos;, the workers began to weep. They wept; I wept; we all wept together. When I finished, I packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.

As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say,


&quot;Sweet Mother of Jesus, I never seen nothin&apos; like that before.... and I&apos;ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years..&quot;

An 86-year-old man went to his doctor for his quarterly check-up. The doctor asked him how he was feeling, and the 86-year-old said
&quot;Things are great and I&apos;ve never felt better. I now have a 20 year-old bride who is pregnant with my child. So what do you think about that Doc ?&quot;

The doctor considered his question for a minute and then began to tell a story.
&quot;I have an older friend , much like you, who is an avid hunter and
never misses a season. One day he was setting off to go hunting. In a bit of a hurry , he accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his gun. As he neared a lake , he came across a very large beaver sitting at the water&apos;s edge. He realized he&apos;d left his gun at home and so he couldn&apos;t shoot the magnificent creature. Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle and went &apos;bang, bang&apos;.&quot;
&quot;Miraculously , two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.&quot;
&quot;Now, what do you think of that ?&quot;asked the doctor.

The 86-year-old said,&quot;Logic would strongly suggest that somebody else pumped a couple of rounds into that beaver.&quot;

The doctor replied ,&quot;My point exactly.&quot;

A woman went up to the bar in a quiet rural pub. She gestured alluringly to the bartender who approached her immediately. She seductively signaled that he should bring his face closer to hers. As he did, she gently caressed his full beard.

&quot;Are you the manager?&quot;she asked, softly stroking his face with both hands.

&quot;Actually, no,&quot;he replied.

&quot;Can you get him for me? I need to speak to him,&quot;she said, running her hands beyond his beard and into his hair.

&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t,&quot;breathed the bartender.&quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I need for you to give him a message,&quot;she continued, running her forefinger across the bartender&apos;s lip and slyly popping a couple of her fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.

&quot;What should I tell him?&quot;the flustered bartender managed to stammer.

&quot;Tell him,&quot;she whispered,&quot;There&apos;s no toilet paper, hand soap, or paper towels in the ladies room.&quot;

Things Your Momma Should Have Told You!







I was in the restaurant yesterday when I suddenly realized I desperately needed to pass gas. The music was really, really loud, so I timed my farts with the beat of the music.


After a couple of songs, I started to feel better. I finished my coffee, and noticed that everybody was staring at me....


Then I suddenly remembered that I was listening to my iPod.

The Shit List

1. GHOST SHIT. You know you&apos;ve shitted. There&apos;s shit on the toilet paper, but none in the toilet.
2. TEFLON-COATED SHIT. Comes out so slick, clean and easy that you don&apos;t even feel it. No trace of shit on the paper. You have to look in the toilet to make sure you did something.
3. GOOEY-SHIT. This has the consistency of hot tar. You wipe your arse 12 times and it&apos;s still not clean. You end up putting toilet paper in your jocks so that you don&apos;t stain them. This kind of shit leaves permanent skid marks in the toilet.
4. SECOND THOUGHT SHIT. You&apos;re all done wiping, and you&apos;re about to stand up when you realise....you&apos;ve got more.
5. POP A VEIN IN YOUR FOREHEAD SHIT The kind of shit that killed Elvis. It doesn&apos;t come out till you&apos;re all sweaty, trembling and purple from straining so hard.
6. WEIGHT WATCHERS SHIT. You shit so much, you lose several kilos.
7. RIGHT NOW SHIT. You had better be within 30 seconds of a toilet. You burn rubber getting to the toilet. Usually it has its head out before you can get your pants down.
8. KING KONG or CHOKER SHIT. This one is so big that you know it won&apos;t go down the toilet unless you break it into smaller chunks. A wire coat hanger works well. This kind of shit usually occurs at someone else&apos;s house.
9. CORK SHIT (also Floater) Even after the third flush it&apos;s still floating in the bowl. You think&quot;SHIT&quot;how do I get rid of it.
10. WET CHEEKS SHIT. This shit hits the water sideways and makes a big splash that gets you all wet.
11. WISH SHIT. You sit there all cramped up in the foetal position and fart a few times, but no shit in sight.
12. CEMENT BLOCK SHIT. You wish you had a spinal anaesthetic before you attempted this one.
13. SNAKE SHIT. This shit is fairly soft, about as thick as your thumb and at least a metre long.
14. BEER AND PIZZA SHIT. This happens the day after the night before. Most of the time your shit doesn&apos;t smell so bad but this one is BAD.... usually this one happens at someone else&apos;s house, and someone is always waiting outside the toilet door.
15. MEXICAN FOOD SHIT (or Screamer). You know will know it&apos;s safe to eat again when your arse stops burning.

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach.

A human hair can hold 3 kg.

The length of the penis is three times the length of the thumb.

Femur is hard as concrete.

The woman&apos;s heart beats faster than the man.

Women blink twice as much as men.

We use 300 muscles just to hold our balance when we stand.

The woman has read this entire text. The man is still looking at his thumb.

Two women friends had gone for a girls&apos; night out. Both were very faithful and loving wives, however they had gotten over-enthusiastic on the Bacardi Breezers.

Incredibly drunk and walking home they needed to pee, so they stopped in the cemetery.

One of them had nothing to wipe with so she thought she would take off her panties and use them.

Her friend however was wearing a rather expensive pair of panties and did not want to ruin them.

She was lucky enough to squat down next to a grave that had a wreath with a ribbon on it, so she proceeded to wipe with that.

After the girls did their business, they proceeded to go home.

The next day, the husband of one of the women was concerned that his wife was still in bed hung over, so he phoned the other husband and said:&quot;These girl nights have got to stop! I&apos;m starting to suspect the worst. My wife came home with no panties!!&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s nothing,&quot;said the other husband,&quot;Mine came back with a card stuck to her ass that said.....

&apos;From all of us at the Fire Station. We&apos;ll never forget you.&apos;

I saw this joke today:

A unionized public employee, a teabagger, and a CEO are sitting at a table. In the middle of the table is a plate with a dozen cookies on it. The CEO reaches across and takes 11 cookies, looks at the teabagger and says,&quot;Watch out for that union guy. He wants a piece of your cookie.&quot;

2 cups of dried fruit
1 teaspoon of salt
1 cup of brown sugar

Take a large bowl. Check the whiskey again. To be sure it&apos;s the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink. Repeat. Turn on the electric mixer, beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl. Add one teaspoon of sugar and beat again.

Make sure the whiskey is still okay. Cry another tup. Turn off the mixer. Beat two leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried fruit. Mix on the tuner. If the fired druit gets stuck in the beaterers, pry it loose with a drewscriver.

Sample the whiskey to check for tonsisticity. Next, sift two cups of salt. Or something. Who cares?

Check the whiskey. Now sift the lemon juice and strain your nuts. Add one table. Spoon. Of sugar or something. Whatever you can find.

Grease the oven. Turn the cake tin to 350 degrees. Don&apos;t forget to beat off the turner. Throw the bowl out of the window. Check the whiskey again and go to bed. Who the hell likes fruitcake anyway?? Re: Jokes and Humor

The Perfect Husband:

Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. A cellular phone on a bench rings and a man engages the hands-free speaker function and begins to talk. Everyone else in the room stops to listen.

MAN:&quot;Hello&quot;
WOMAN:&quot;Hi Honey, it&apos;s me. Are you at the club?&quot;
MAN:&quot;Yes.&quot;
WOMAN:&quot;I&apos;m at the shops now and found this beautiful leather coat. It&apos;s only $2,000; is it OK if I buy it?&quot;
MAN:&quot;Sure, go ahead if you like it that much.&quot;
WOMAN:&quot;I also stopped by the Lexus dealership and saw the new models. I saw one I really liked.&quot;
MAN:&quot;How much?&quot;
WOMAN:&quot;$90,000.&quot;
MAN:&quot;OK, but for that price I want it with all the options.&quot;
WOMAN: “Great! Oh, and one more thing... I was just talking to Janie and found out that the house I wanted last year is back on the market. They&apos;re asking $980,000 for it.&quot;
MAN:&quot;Well, then go ahead and make an offer of $900,000. They&apos;ll probably take it. If not, we can go the extra eighty thousand if it&apos;s what you really want.&quot;
WOMAN:&quot;OK. I&apos;ll see you later! I love you so much!&quot;
MAN:&quot;Bye! I love you, too.&quot;

The man hangs up. The other men in the locker room are staring at him in astonishment, mouths wide open. He turns and asks,&quot;Anyone know whose phone this is?&quot;

Traditionally, it took twelve days for the three wise men / kings to travel east to west, following the star, and find the child.

What would have happened if it had been Three Wise Women instead of the Three Wise Men?

They would have:

Asked directions
Arrived on time
Helped deliver the baby
Cleaned the stable
Made a casserole, and
Brought practical gifts

But then - what would they have said when they left?

&quot;Did you see the sandals Mary was wearing with that gown?&quot;
&quot;That baby didn&apos;t look anything like Joseph.&quot;
&quot;Can you believe they&apos;d let all those disgusting animals in the house?&quot;
&quot;I heard Joseph isn&apos;t even working right now.&quot;
&quot;And that donkey. Huh, it&apos;s seen better days!&quot;
&quot;Want to bet how long it will take to get your casserole dish back?&quot;
