No annual fee or membership fee. Seems a decent alternative choice to Penfed and Fort Knox.
Has anyone used it right now? How do you think guys?

How is 4% gas better than 5% gas?

I&apos;d rather use my PenFed for gas and my Schwab for everything else, and forego the extra 10 cents rebate when I go to the movies.

Not bad if you&apos;re looking to reduce the number of cards you carry, but I&apos;ll stick with my HSBC Rewards (5% g/g/ds), MTVu (5% cinema, food&amp;restaurant) and Fido 529 (2% everything else).

Now that TU pulls may or may not be bumpable, you may want to consider the $250/month cap on the gas spending earning the 4% and the 0.25% rewards on the first 10K/year in non-bonus categories. The grocery/fast food/restaurant bonus spending cap of $750/month may also be too low for many. Not a card to replace all others, but could be a marginally useful addition.
