The Fast Food Napkin Poll: All or Nothing?
 When I go through the drive-thru at a fast food place, I am either given no napkins at all or a huge handful of napkins that last the rest of the week. Is this what happens to you? What&apos;s up with that? Interesting Question? Yes ( 2 ) No ( 0 )

 marisaupa Marked as Best! February 22, 2010 05:51 PM The number of napkins I get varies greatly, but that is to be expected. Many people get upset by this when they really shouldn&apos;t.

What many people do not realize when they get upset is that the breeding cycle of the common paper napkin (umbo chartus napkinusus) is susceptible to many factors. When temperature conditions are just right, 2 or three napkins placed in your fast food bag can easily multiply and become 20 or 30 by the time you open your bag and munch down that first french fry.

As a matter of fact, most fast food restaurants purposely only place 2 napkins in your bag relying on the prolific breeding pattern of the paper napkin to reproduce and serve you with more napkins when you open the bag.

Sadly, excessive amounts of salt on fries, spilled ketchup, or the presence of napkin natural predators, such as the napkin hawk, can at times reduce the napkin population in your bag.

So, do not complain, it is not the fast food restaurant playing head games with you. It is just nature.

Remember, if you ran out of napkins, that&apos;s what sleeves are for.

 marlene February 22, 2010 08:12 PM Ah, yes - the great napkin dilemma! It can happen and in one&apos;s lifetime it WILL happen. BUT - I&apos;m ready for it! When I get an abundance of napkins, I stick them in a plastic baggie in my glove compartment. If napkins are forgotten at the drive-thru, I have my reserve ready. If I&apos;m totally fortunate, my order is right! Helpful Answer? ( 0 )  ( 0 ) Permalink | Report Reply Cancel Comment Add Source Refute Fact Add: Video | Photo | Audio

 charray7 February 22, 2010 11:49 PM I feel the same way.. it&apos;s either tons of napkins or none at all. I use drive-thru fast food places a lot so I don&apos;t really notice how many napkins I get until I home. Once I get home, if they forget to include napkins, I can use my own paper towels. If they put a bunch in there, I&apos;ll use a couple and put the rest aside. (as long as the fries and catchup worms don&apos;t get on them) That way, I can use their free napkins before I have to use the paper towels that I buy. ( I just buy paper towels. I don&apos;t buy paper napkins) Helpful Answer? ( 0 )  ( 0 ) Permalink | Report Reply Cancel Comment Add Source Refute Fact Add: Video | Photo | Audio

 hawkeyepie... February 23, 2010 12:44 AM I&apos;ve had both scenerios happen to me, but usually its no napkins, which really annoys me because fast food is greasy, and I need napkins! Also, lately, fast food places have been really stingy with ketchup; either I have to ask for it or I don&apos;t get any. What ever happened to the days when a NORMAL amount of napkins and ketchup were complimentary? Source(s):

 lidyax2 February 23, 2010 01:18 AM Even some good restaurants are very stingy with napkins here. Only 1 per customer or 1 per food ordered. If I really need it I&apos;ll ask for more, if I bring my own tissue papers, I;ll use my own tissue paper. I dont want to make a big deal out of it. At fast food, you can&apos;t expect their service to be excellent. At the bright side, it&apos;s a way to save the trees. lol. Helpful Answer?

 unwirklich February 23, 2010 05:06 AM Throws in some trivia from someone who was unfortunate enough to manage in fast food for some time.

Taco bell at least actually very closely mandates how napkins, forks and sauce should be given. They instruct employees to give 1.5 sauce packet per item, one fork and two napkins. If inventory reflects that more is being given managers get their bonus cut.

I saw a lot of employees taking &quot;2&quot; to mean none because they don&apos;t want to take the time to grab just two, and then when asked to give napkins get pissy and give a whole handful lol Helpful Answer?

 jkepler February 23, 2010 05:59 AM Surprisingly, I get a reasonable amount of them pretty often. That being said, getting too many doesn&apos;t really have to be a problem. What is a problem is not getting any at all. Keeping a few in your glove box can be a lifesaver. Helpful Answer?

 shewolfsil... February 23, 2010 02:00 PM When you have kids you need napkins! We went to a Denny&apos;s the other day and the only napkins around were the ones wrapped around our silverware. You had to ask for more napkins and then they only brought a couple. If you have a young boy eating chicken strips with dipping sauce you need more than one napkin! Helpful Answer?
