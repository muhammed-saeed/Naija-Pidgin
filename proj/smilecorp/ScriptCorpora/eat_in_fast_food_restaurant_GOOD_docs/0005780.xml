MVP4® Moisture Vapor Protection is a one-part, trowel applied, elastomeric, moisture cure urethane membrane designed to be used beneath glue-down installations of engineered and solid and bamboo hardwood flooring with Bostik&apos;s Best®, BST, EFA+, or TKO adhesives. MVP4 is designed to:1. Reduce moisture vapor transmission from the subfloor;2. Create a noise reduction barrier over the substrate;3. Establish an anti-fracture membrane that can bridge cracks that can occur in the substrate prior to or after installation (up to 1/8&quot;).MVP4 may be used over all substrates common to hardwood flooring installations including: concrete, plywood, particle or chip board (underlayment grade), well bonded vinyl, ceramic tile, cement backer board, cement patch/underlaymen ts, radiant heat flooring, gypsum concrete and terrazzo. MVP4 may be applied to fresh &quot;green&quot; concrete as soon as it has achieved &quot;initial set&quot; (when concrete can be walked on without disturbing the surface). MVP4 contains Bostik BLOCKADETM antimicrobial protection which inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold or mildew on the surface of the dried membrane; the dried membrane resists stains caused by mold.MVP4 independently tested in a controlled laboratory environment to measure the IIC (Impact Insulation Class) according to ASTM E492-04 and E989-89 and STC (Sound Transmission Class) according to ASTM E90-04 and E413- 04 standards installed with 9/16&quot; thick engineered wood flooring over a 6&quot; concrete sub floor with a 5/8&quot; suspended gypsum ceiling, achieved an IIC = 62 and a STC = 61, with no suspended ceiling, IIC = 49 and STC = 52.
