Diabetes? Start Vinegar Now!
 David Spero 
OK, y’all. I wrote about this a year ago , but now I’m serious. If you want to control any type of diabetes better, consume vinegar before meals and at bedtime. Start today! It lowers post-meal and fasting glucose levels.

In a study from Arizona State University, subjects took a drink of 20 grams of apple cider vinegar , 40 grams of water, and 1 teaspoon of saccharine with each meal. (I think stevia might be better than saccharine.) Those with insulin resistance who drank the vinegar had 34% lower postprandial (after-meal) glucose compared to controls.

These postprandial benefits had been found before. It was thought that vinegar might slow the absorption of carbohydrate into the blood, or slow the breakdown of starches into sugars. This effect would mimic the effect of drugs like acarbose (brand name Precose).

But the 2004 study cited above reported that vinegar reduced postprandial glucose more in subjects who were highly insulin resistant . The authors say this result shows that vinegar increases insulin sensitivity, perhaps acting similarly to metformin.

Now studies have found that vinegar at bedtime reduces fasting blood glucose in the morning, indicating that vinegar might promote insulin production, like nateglinide (Starlix.)

Pretty amazing that a simple chemical like vinegar (acetic acid) could have the benefits of three different classes of diabetes drugs, and all for two cents a dose! It’s likely good for both Type 2 and Type 1, especially for lowering postprandial glucose. And postprandial glucose levels account for 30% to 70% of A1C values . Vinegar has got to be the most cost-effective medicine in history, but most people with diabetes still aren’t taking it.

And doctors aren’t prescribing it. Why not? Is it because there are no“vinegar reps”touring medical offices to promote their products, like drug companies do? Physicians need to wake up. Natural approaches can work, and doctors should make patients aware of them.

It’s the same reason the studies I’ve cited here are so small. Because vinegar is so cheap, there’s no profit motive to draw funding for larger studies. (Just a note for those who think the market solves health-care problems.)

How can vinegar be so powerful? I think it has to do with our ancestral diet. We used to eat carbohydrate in highly complex forms that took a long time to break down in the intestines. Some of that material may have converted to vinegar before being absorbed. Vinegar may be a signal to our bodies to produce insulin and not resist it. Today’s highly refined carbohydrates are absorbed long before they start breaking down. Our bodies don’t get the ancestral signals that carbohydrates are coming, so they’re not ready for them. Drinking a bit of vinegar might trigger the hormones and transmitters that are now missing the boat.

This theory might be nonsense, but the benefits of vinegar are proven reality. In response to my last vinegar article, nearly a dozen readers posted comments about how vinegar had helped them reduce their blood glucose and lose weight. There were no dissenting comments. Go back and read them here .

Readers mostly use apple cider vinegar, which has been touted for centuries for many health benefits . However, wine vinegar, rice vinegar, and white vinegar may be equally good. They just haven’t been studied. Balsamic vinegar apparently is not good; it’s too sugary.

The optimum vinegar dose hasn’t been established. Most reports have people taking 1–2 tablespoons before each meal containing carbohydrate, and at bedtime. It might be best to take vinegar with the first bite of the meal, to prevent the reported side effects of nausea and heartburn. But these should be rare at such low doses, anyway. You can also take vinegar tablets, which are cheap and widely available.

Here are some recipes readers sent:

Paul V: Half a glass of water with a tablespoon of cider vinegar
Kelly: Sliced cucumbers and cold vinegar in a bowl
Vicki: Two tablespoons of vinegar with one tablespoon of honey
Betty and Deb: Apple cider vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil (and optionally, mustard) as a salad dressing
Brecklundin: Apple cider vinegar in iced tea with lemon or lime and stevia
Juli: A glug of apple cider vinegar, a spoonful of honey, and the rest of the glass full of water
David: One tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in 1 cup of water, with a few drops of stevia

I can add that rice vinegar, sesame oil, and honey makes a great Thai salad dressing.

So get on this, people! If you’re spending money on medicines to reduce postprandial glucose levels, you are missing a sure bet here. I’m betting many people with Type 2 will be able to get off some medicines or significantly reduce them. People with Type 1 might be able to lower insulin doses. All can probably achieve lower A1Cs. Please let us know how it goes. And speak to your doctor about it.

We should all try this before bed and report our FBS. Of course we would also need to report how different this is from our average fasting. Think I’ll try it tonight. One question: can we use any kind of vinegar, like balsamic, red wine, or white?
 Posted by Gail P | May 25, 2011 at 4:37 pm 
Go for it, Gail! As I said, wine, white, apple cider, or rice vinegar seem good, but balsamic probably isn’t.
 Posted by David Spero RN | May 25, 2011 at 5:52 pm 
Are there any studies of Vinegar vs. Lemon Juice? Is this ANY simple acid, or do some of the benefits seem unique to vinegar? Are there cumulative effects to vinegar + cinnamon?
 Posted by Yisroel | May 25, 2011 at 11:11 pm 
Hmmm. Is there any reason to believe that the vinegar at the beginning of a meal cannot be part of the food of the meal? Because I am sure that we did not evolve drinking vinegar before eating. But there is the traditional practice from many parts of Europe of eating a salad with vinaigrette dressing before a meal; and many Middle and Eastern European countries traditionally begin a meal with soup, and lots of the old traditional recipes from these areas include some vinegar. Like many traditional practices, these may have hidden benefits that we are only now discovering.

In my mother’s family (her parents were from Slovakia), soup was a necessity of life. If you had not eaten soup, you had not had supper. Most of the family soup recipes passed down to me have either vinegar or sauerkraut in them. To be authentic, the sauerkraut must be home made. (Yes, I make my own, and it’s easy.) And the highest praise you could give any food was“Not bad, it’s not too sweet.”

Fantastic observation. Can’t wait to try it. Natural remedies? You bet they work. Thanks for the insight!
 Posted by Brian Grinonneau | May 26, 2011 at 11:02 am 
what about the tablets that have the apple cider vinegar? does it have to be liquid?
 Posted by Donna Bennett | May 26, 2011 at 5:26 pm 
???what about pickle juice? I have a hard time with liquid vinegar, but i like pickle juice! just one of those wierd things left over from childhood…
 Posted by Donna Bennett | May 26, 2011 at 6:27 pm 
Interesting questions from everyone. Beth, I’m sure including vinegar in food is as good as drinking it beforehand. Donna, I think the tablets are just as good as liquid vinegar. Pickle juice is largely vinegar, so it should be fine. Lemon juice has been anecdotally reported to lower postprandial sugars, perhaps by lowering the rate at which sugars are absorbed.

If possible, please keep track of how whatever you try affects your blood glucose and report back to us.

The active principal in vinegar is acetic acid. Even people who do not consume vinegar get acetic acid, mainly from bacteria in the large intestine. The fermentation of dietary fiber in the large intestine leads to a slow steady release of acetic acid into the blood stream between meals. Many of the health benefits of fiber are the result of acetic acid produced by friendly bacteria in our gut.

I am starting the vinegar shot today! I’ve done it before and not stayed with it but this time I’m serious! Thanks!
 Posted by Linda Bryan | Jun 01, 2011 at 12:15 pm 
Paul, naturally fermented cucumbers (pickles) and sauerkraut have lactic acid. Does this also affect the body like acetic acid? Or is it different?
 Posted by Beth | Jun 01, 2011 at 1:01 pm 
Can I safely begin doing the vinegar regimen while taking metformin twice a day (1,000mg each)?
 Posted by Neil Lemme | Jun 01, 2011 at 1:06 pm 
Interesting theory. As a juvenile diabetic school nurse and a diabetic myself, I’m always looking at all possibilities. I personally have gastroparesis and cider vinegar is an irritant.Will give it a try using rice vinegar.
 Posted by Dolores | Jun 01, 2011 at 1:46 pm 
Does it have to be stevia or woulld equal work as well? I’ve never tried stevia. Can someone tell me how they compare if you’re tried it and equal. I’m also going to try it. My doctor has me on insulin twice a day, but I get lumps at the injection site that are painful and stick around for a couple of days. Doctor can’t figure it out.
 Posted by Paul | Jun 01, 2011 at 3:03 pm 
I am a Medical Doctor in Family Practice, I have been in medical field for 47 years.
I have had Type II Diabetes, for over 20 years. My diabetes is under excellent control and so far I have none of the late effects of Diabetes. I must now take the maximum dose of each of the different types of oral diabetic prescription medication. I also must supplement these medications with all of the safe, studied, and effective, non-prescription products, many of which are routinely mentioned in your articles at: 
In addition I must eat a well balanced diabetically correct diet and maintain my weight and exercise daily. I want to make a few comments how I chose the treatments I use for myself, and then recommend to my patients, family and friends.

1: I have been taught and found very useful, the “scientific method” for evaluation and selection of treatments which are safe, studied, and effective. (in medicine safety is relative to the side effects of the disease you are treating, which often seems to be forgotten by many)

2: The scientific method cannot be ignored just because, funding is not enough for non-prescription to be properly evaluated. I find many of the non-prescription products I use have been adequately evaluated by scientific method, if you factor in the very low risk potential of the treatment being studied.

I must make a suggestion, your reasons that you state for non-prescription treatments not being adequately studied are very common and often repeated. Do not give in to them so easily, as you appear to be very knowledgeable and concerned about Diabetes. Many of the non-prescription treatments are studied as I have found with diligent searching of the scientifically based web resources. For the treatments that have not been, I recommend a possible solution. Have the, For Profit non-prescription treatment Industry (magazines, web sites, advertisers, manufactures, concerned consumers, growers, form a PAC and so forth), fund research into these products and encourage them to lobby for their funding to be tax deductible and their involvement legally advertised and promoted in the media and on their products. In other words the same way the pharmaceutical industry does. Don’t mention their profits in a rebuttal as my suggestion could be as relatively profitable in the long run and the cost of materials and research and the studies should be much less.

David,
I was wondering…do you have to include the water and sweetener in this equation? I happen to really like vinegar, and I would just take the two tablespoons by themselves. Thanks for the info!
 Posted by Tammie | Jun 01, 2011 at 3:14 pm 
Some form of vineagar has usually been part of my eating plan, at least for my biggest meals. I do believe it’s helped—my usual PP sugars and A1c’s are pretty good.

I’ve been on metformin for a number of years, and using it has caused no problems. But, no matter what med you might be on, I’d keep very close track of how adding vineagar might be affecting your blood sugars. Go a week or so checking pre-meal and 2-hr PP sugars before trying it, then start using it, keeping the same records. You might be able to cut back on your meds!!

About pickle juice, I’d say that you might want to be careful. Some types have a lot of salt in them.
 Posted by Marcie | Jun 01, 2011 at 3:30 pm 
I’ve done the apple cider vinegar(organic from T. Joes) and water in a shot glass 1/2 and 1/2 and had noticed a definitive difference in my blood sugar levels, but I didn’t stick w/it like Linda Bryan. There’s something real easy abt doing a shot glass. Be very careful to not brush your teeth shortly after drinking your vinegar-its bad for your teeth…I usually wait at least 1/2 hour and drink water to help harden enamel. If anyone knows any better tips please advise…guess I should find a dentist to ask.
 Posted by evelyn hub | Jun 01, 2011 at 3:45 pm 
I can’t wait to try this. I think I will do just fine with. I will do it this evening with my meal.
 Posted by Barbara | Jun 01, 2011 at 5:17 pm 
Re: Sweeteners—you don’t need them—they’re just to help the vinegar go down. It certainly doesn’t have to be stevia—use whatever you want.

Thanks to all for good suggestions.

Apple Cider Vinegar and honey goes way back as a health promoting mixture as well as a healing one. Glad to see this with the sugar sub replacing the honey.
 Posted by Dot | Jun 01, 2011 at 6:03 pm 
I think caution should be advised…I tried the cider vinegar regime and got a terrible nose bleed that I couldn’t stop. In my entire life, I never had a nose bleed, except when I got hit in the face with a ball once. It scared the heck out of me. I stopped the vinegar and haven’t had a nose bleed since. Thins the blood so if you’re taking any meds for blood thinning or something like that, be careful.

I was disagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January, 2004. I was unalbe to obtain a dietician’s appointment until July. Scared and not knowing what to do about diet, I read as much as I could and developed my own diet. I ate only fish and chicken (mainly fish), salads, fresh vegetables and made my own salad dressing. I mixed 1/2 cup of Flatseed oil with 3 cups of basalmic vinegar, added some garlic powder and onion powder and 2 packed of a diet sweetner. I shook it up each time I ate salad (twice a day). I even carried a little bottle of it with me when I ate out. In addition I also walked on the treadmill.
All of my blood levels were extremely high, but after 4 months of this way of eating, most of the high levels were under 100! And I didn’t need any diabetic medicine. I lost 80 pounds without trying. I love the basalmic vinegar and flatseed oil dressing. It is great! Try it!

Here’s a vinegar recipie.I remember coming home from school and the aroma of vinegar making my mouth water instantaniously. My father always liked making Adobo since he has Filipino heritage. You can use any meat. The vinegar has a way of breaking down the toughest of meats so we grew up eatting it with chicken, rabbit, goat or any animal they caught hunting. The simple dish is 1 part water with 1 part vinegar. I like 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar so it’s not too strong.(Enough to cover ypour meat) You can add whole peppercorns into the pot and a bay leaf if you have it. Sometimes he would use pickling spice in the pot too but it’s good either way. Then, just boil your meat slowly. It’ll be so tender. This might not be an authentic recipie. Maybe you can look up varietions.

Hi, 30 years ago my sister lived in Switzerland and she told me that everyone she met took apple vinegar and water before every meal for weight loss. Maybe, they knew something the rest of us didn’t!

Wondering about any change that might happen if using other sweetners such as Spelnda. Is Stevia the only sweetner that has been tried?
 Posted by Alan | Jun 01, 2011 at 10:09 pm 
Thank you so very much for what you suggest. I
have begun the Apple Cider Vinegar and Stevia and
water just this moment. I have been a diabetic for
the past five years since the death of my husband
of 40 years. I am pleased to tell you I have been
a watchful person of Dr. Oz and all the fine Doctors
working with him. At the age I am of 83, I look and
feel like a woman of 60. My blood work, I am told is
as good or better than a 24 year old. God Bless you
all for the encouragement given to me. PNN

I’m a believer in Apple Cider Vinegar! The ancient saying,“An Apple a Day will Keep the Doctor Away”has a lot of truth in it. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) is all natural. It is made from real Apples. I’ve used ACV in water with my meals for many years. I use ACV in soups, dry beans, cabbage slaw, deviled eggs, etc. I use on my feet, in my shoes, for stomach ache, reflux and the list goes on. I keep ACV in my kitchen, bathroom, travel, and at work. If you feel lousy, mix a strong ACV and water, then Chug-a-lug. If the taste is too bad, chase it with a spoonful of pure honey then go to bed. The next morning you will feel much better.

Pickle juice has many additives, i.e., sugar, salt, spices, etc., and therefore it is not an all natural food like ACV (read the label). When using a vinegar other than ACV, consider how and what it is made of–usually has additive of some sort that is not good for humans. Usually over salted and over sugared and definitely not good for the human system. Bring on the ACV!

Sincerely, Lavbro, The Vinegar Lady

I had never heard of this remedy, but it seems like an easy thing to try and will…how hard can it be to swallow a couple of teaspoons of vinegar? I will try this beginning tonight. Thank you!

I have a close friend who is not a diabetic but recommended taking honey and apple cider as a calming agent to help getting to sleep at night. I have been mixing Sue Bee Honey and Apple Cider vinegar (50/50) for years and notice a drastic improvement in the fasting glucose levels. For some reason I had stopped about a year ago and without giving it any thought couldn’t understand why my fasting levels had risen until NOW!!!!!!

Thanks, for kick starting my memory.

Try sekajuban (spelling varies). It’s a wonderful Islamic drink that is extremely tasty and refreshing, replaces electrolytes, and calms nausea. Suggest you google for recipes. Great for the summer too.
 Posted by Cynthia L. | Jun 02, 2011 at 2:35 pm 
This remedy very much sounds like something I would like to try especially at this time. This article and all the comments I just read make me want to go try taking vinegar immediately to control my glucose count, however, I am wondering how vinegar would affect the teeth in the long run. I recently read that chewable Vitamin C tablets will eventually dissolve the teeth, so that leads me to wonder about the long-range effect of consumption of vinegar. After all, vinegar is acidic too. Does anyone (especially that doctor who, himself is diabetic) have any knowledge about this?
 Posted by Alicia S. | Jun 03, 2011 at 12:17 am 
PLEASE BE AWARE As the vineagar may help in one area you must know it also helps in lowering blood presure and some one like me whose preasure is normal to low CANNOT drink vineagar every day. My blood preasure will drop and I will be fatigued. I carry average 117/72 and it will go to 90/60. Anyone with high or above normal can drink vineagar but anyone with normal to low can only drink it twice a week. Thank you
 Posted by Mari | Jun 03, 2011 at 7:27 am 
This sound wonderful. I have type 2 diabetes (since 1993). My A1c is not good. I will try this and see if it makes a difference.
 Posted by Helen McCraw | Jun 03, 2011 at 10:43 am 
Those who are trying vinegar for the first time (or trying it again), please track some blood glucose levels and let us know your results.

Regarding dental concerns with vinegar—this is something to be aware of, it seems. If you’re drinking vinegar straight or with sweetener, you might want to swallow it without running it around your teeth—and in any event, rinse with a swallow of plain water afterward.

Mari, thanks for your caution about low blood pressure. I think if anyone notices lightheadedness or weakness, they should cut down their dose. But I don’t think that would apply to very many people.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Jun 03, 2011 at 12:40 pm 
To avoid the possible problem to teeth, try drinking with a straw. I read/heard that red wine stains teeth and they were told to use a straw.
 Posted by Betts | Jun 04, 2011 at 10:09 am 
Can you refer some of the scientific studies that provide the evidence for these conclusions. I read the testimonials and want to try the vinegar. Think I may have in the past but not consistantly or posibly not long enough to see change. I am a very insulin resistant type 2 diabetic and end up taking more and more insulin.
 Posted by Deanie Schrader | Jun 05, 2011 at 8:59 am 
If only things were so simple…

Frankly, I believe that there are too many“if”s,“I think”s and unsupported assertions that are on the verge of being offered as fact.

–OBSERVED EFFECT LESS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES SUBJECTS
At the end of the second paragraph in your article it states:“Those with insulin resistance who drank the vinegar had 34% lower postprandial (after-meal) glucose compared to controls.”

However, you do not point out that in the original ASU study article it indicates that the decrease was 19% among the 10 individuals with Tyepe 2 Diabetes that were included in the study. In addition, none of the Type 2 Diabetes individuals were using any medication–of ANY kind–for their diabetes. (http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281.full)

–VINEGAR ALSO LED TO REDUCTION OF INSULIN
The study also indicates that in measuring the levels of incremental insulin in the blood, compared to before the meal, it was found that in those individuals that had the vinegar drink, their level of insulin produced after the meal was also decreased. This was most pronounced at 30 minutes after the meal. At 60 minutes after the meal, the difference apparently due to drinking vinegar was much less and in some instances essentially no difference.

Hmmmm, I have Type 2 Diabetes…if I drink vinegar I will have less insulin in my blood for part of the time after I eat. Less insulin? Is that what I really want to happen if my body is already having problems producing enough insulin to properly transport glucose into cells? That seems problematic to me.

–ANCESTRAL DIET?…WINE BEFORE VINEGAR!
Yeah, whatever. I do think it is indeed quite safe to say that your theory is nonsense.

Besides, getting to the point where consumed carbs yield vinegar means that fermentation occurred, which yields alcohol before it can become vinegar. Maybe our ancestors ate so that they could get buzzed? Nah, don’t suspect that was happening either.

–DANGEROUS BET!
“I’m betting many people with Type 2 will be able to get off some medicines or significantly reduce them.”

Whoa, hold on there! Remember, the Arizona State Study only included 10 individuals with Type 2 Diabetes. These people were different than the“insulin resistant”pre-diabetic participants in the study. AND, the all of individuals with Type 2 Diabetes were NOT using ANY medication for their diabetes!

It’s quite a stretch from the observations, of a single non-definitive small sample study from 2004, of individuals with untreated Type 2 Diabetes to make a pronouncement that individuals being treated for Type 2 Diabetes might reduce their medication levels. The other side of that bet could just turn out to be the wiser choice.

In any case, leading up to and supporting a statement like that borders on reckless! But hey, I’m just a person with Type 2 Diabetes…

–VINEGAR, A DENTISTS BEST FRIEND?
One caution that should responsibly be pointed out about drinking vinegar is that it can become hell on tooth enamel. Really an oversight in this article.

I don’t usually take to the keyboard to comment on articles I read, but this one just could not be let pass since too many people may misconstrue the enthusiastic endorsement of vinegar as a presentation of fact. Even if everything stated were true, there is not sufficient supporting science to treat this as casually as has been.

Buyer beware!

Excellent point by J Castillo.

The american proclivity to look for single all encompassing solutions like silver bullits, wooden crosses and garlic strings fighting Dracula and the bloodsuckers; the complex problems resulting from endoctrine system aging, degeneration and failure do not lend themselves to one solution fights all.

Is is your liver, is it your pancrease and reduced release of insulin, bad diet, wrong volumes of wrong foods, bad genes, low hearty exercise and resulting insulin resistance, faulty endocrine organ signalling? What blend is wrecking your house?

We all want miracles, and God knows; I am willing to believe but?
 Posted by jim snell | Jun 06, 2011 at 12:22 pm 
Some of J Castillo’s points are worth thinking about. Jenny Ruhl at Diabetes Update also wrote me to say she thought most of the benefits for postmeal glucose came from delayed gastric emptying, and so would have limited value.

I’ll address all these concerns in July, after I’ve had time to do more research. If I presented vinegar as a“cure,”I apologize. It’s not. But I do believe it can be a big help for successful management of diabetes.

Carol Johnston at Arizona State, who did the two most cited vinegar studies, wants to do larger, longer ones but hasn’t found financial backing yet.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Jun 06, 2011 at 2:47 pm 
A good review of the literature on vinegar and glucose levels is available from Medscape:

 http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/531649_3 

There is a lot more than just the two Arizona State studies I cited.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Jun 06, 2011 at 3:04 pm 
David:

Thank you for keeping us advised on key and important issues.

The issue of gastric emptying is very important. I have found it most important to rest after meal for at least 30 minutes to allow stomach and gastric emptying work properly so that stomach - pancreas signalling get meal bolus released fully.

Racing around and serious activity immediatly after eating will rush the contents into intestine and cause fast glucose release/spiking.

I have repeatedly watched that on cgms and now allow short rest to prevent that.
 Posted by jim snell | Jun 06, 2011 at 6:20 pm 
I am taking apple cider vinegar capsules…What dosage is recommended? I have 1500 mg capsules. That seems like a lot!
 Posted by Barbara | Jun 08, 2011 at 2:09 pm 
I have actually started eating dill pickles and a few spoons full of the pickle juice at meal time with a very noticeable improvement in my readings. Did it one evening before bed and woke up with a nice reading of 102. At least nice for me.
 Posted by john w. | Jun 08, 2011 at 3:12 pm 
Well, I haven’t thought that vinegar would help to reduce post meal blood sugar. Surely I would like to try, but my only reservation, would it elevate arthritis condition any worse or give rise to digestive disorder if taken over time.
 Posted by Izaaknor | Jun 09, 2011 at 10:05 am 
Just now reading all the info and comments on this post. I am not on meds yet for diabetes but trying to control with diet and exercise. So I am very willing to try this and see what it does. I’ll try to rinse my mouth well with water after using so I won’t damage my teeth. I had read of this before but was skeptical. I think vinegar is a very safe and simple thing to try. Hey, I’m willing to try it before I go on medications or insulin. I’ll keep a record of my BG’s and see what they do. Thank you for all the helpful info you find for us.

For those who get heartburn easily, do you know if these properties of vinegar survive if it is mixed with a dash of baking soda to raise the pH?
 Posted by Avery | Jun 10, 2011 at 5:26 am 
Regarding digestive issues and heartburn from vinegar: I don’t think taking vinegar with baking soda is a good idea, although I couldn’t find anything about it on the Web. Taking it with food would be best, like in a salad dressing. You could also try the vinegar capsules. Vinegar shouldn’t cause digestive problems for many people. As others have commented, it’s a major part of many cuisines.

I love vinegar, Do you think it would be ok to put a little crushed red pepper in the vinegar if you like it on greens, dry beans and other kinds of vegetables.
Also, still drink the water/vinegar mix before meals and at bedtime?

Have started this method just since first of month after my last blood work. I am diabetic but managing with diet/exercise - averages last three months of morning fasting readings were 128/125/123 - so far this month - my average is 117 for morning readings. I don’t consistently take other reading during the day, but when I have, they too have been much lower than pre vinegar method. My next A1C testing not to be done till Sept, so have a few months to really check the benefits. So far, I am thrilled!! I never want to take manufactured meds as I view them as‘toxins’to my system and will hold off till I can’t do more on other natural remidies and exercises. Hope this encourages others to give it a try- many benefits of apple cider vinegar - not only in human consumption.

apple cider is not a Philippine product but we have cane, saha (palm) suka (vinegar). I mix 1 part vinegar with 2 parts water and brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon. after taking it the first time in the evening, I woke up feeling light the next morning, unlike before.
now since this is to be taken with meals, I slice pepino (cucmber) and dip into the mix, like salad. the results are good. no medical doctor has advised this. thank you for the info.
 Posted by Danny | Jun 14, 2011 at 10:04 pm 
In most of Filipino dish, vinegar or suka always form part of the diet. I’ve grown up using vinegar even in cooking rice just like japanese way of preparing their sushi, but never in my imagination that drinking vinegar is more beneficial especially for diabetics and it even helps losing weights. I’m not diabetic yet, but my brother has it before he died, my Mom has it too in her old age of 89th and my 2 sisters had it too. I was overwhelmed of the probability of having it if not careful with my food in take. Thanks for this simple and very affordable method. I will try this today and thanks for sharing this. may God bless you.
 Posted by Tetski | Jun 19, 2011 at 12:25 am 
This day I will try the“vinagar”method and see if it will help with my sugar levels. I am recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes and I know I will have to continue ALL medications such as metformin and insulin until doctor otherwise advises and that’s cool but not only have I read that this vinegar thing might be helpful in managing my sugar here on this site but other medical sites because I’ve been doing some intensive research on what to eat, to drink, carbs, calories, etc. and vinegar definitely showed up in a“POSITIVE”light. I’m going for it and will come back and let you know what I found out. Thanks so much for the info.
 Posted by Cecelia | Jul 23, 2011 at 1:46 am 
What about lemon and lime juice? Has any testing been done to prove that vinegar is better than they are? They have some of the same characteristics, and if they have the same effect, would give us more choices. I’d like to see that kind of test done . . . In the meantime, I’m adding vinegar. I guess pickle juice would be one I might be able to stomach. I loved it as a teen . .

Isn’t there a difference between white vineger and apple cider and don’t they use white vineger in pickles etc? I have always believed that white vineger was bad for you and only used it for cleaning.
 Posted by Nece | Oct 29, 2011 at 10:49 am 
White vinegar is safe to drink, Nece. Probably others like apple cider or rice vinegar are better, though.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Oct 31, 2011 at 8:20 pm 
David:

I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes about 6 months ago. It runs in my family.
For at three generations my relatives and myself now are taking vinegar half an ounce 3 times daily. Some with artificial sweeteners and some with honey. We all have great success with this treatment.
Of course the correct diabetic is important to follow as well.
Yes, be careful with your teeth, don’t swish and swallow just down the hatch.
 Posted by Uli Landeck, RN | Dec 08, 2011 at 3:46 pm 
i am very excited in trying vinegar, will start on monday with one tablespoon every other day, positive thinking is also very good i feel people need that too, negative thinking makes you worry SO STOP THINK POSITIVE
 Posted by terry | Dec 11, 2011 at 2:31 pm 
I am 65 with type II diabetes. After returning from a cruise recently, my fasting glucose was 371. The first tablespoon of white vinegar reduced my glucose to 283. I continued for three days and my fasting glucose is currently 131 with medicine taken twice daily. I was so afraid for my health. Thank you for you article on vinegar.
 Posted by Doris | Dec 17, 2011 at 5:25 pm 
I tried the vinegar straight and my throat burned for the entire day. What gives? Any suggestions.
 Posted by Connie | Jan 09, 2012 at 12:56 am 
Sorry, Connie. Some people can chug vinegar straight, but for most, it’s better to mix with food or in a salad dressing. On these comments, there are many other suggestions for how to take it.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Jan 09, 2012 at 1:58 pm 
Thanks for all the info about vinegar. I started tonight because my blood glucose levels are usually 193 to 279. I never thought to try vinegar. I believe it will definately lower my levels. I am an advocate of natural cures. I will report back in a few days to reveal my results.
 Posted by Rochelle Hardison | Jan 11, 2012 at 3:15 am 
I have read all the comments on using vinegar to lower sugar levels. I am impressed. I will begin tonight and report back. My pre-breakfast sugar levels are normally in the 240 range. I will let you know what they are tomorrow morning afer taking the vinegar tonic tonight.
 Posted by Alice Alexande | Jan 15, 2012 at 6:24 pm 
The effects of vinegar reduces glucose at bed time is proven to be true with myself. One night I tested my blood glucose 1 hour before I went to sleep and it was 215, I wanted to take my metformin 850mg but I opted for two shots of vinegar and water. I fell asleep at 11pm and awaken to use the bathroom at 2am. I checked my glucose level then and it was 101, I am a type 2 diabetic of 4 years. I will not completely come off of meds before having a medical consult but I will certainly continue to test my glucose and add vinegar to my diet. Hopefully, with consistent exercise and a proper food intake, I can control my type 2 diabetes without or with reduce medicine.
 Posted by Crystal Stewart | Feb 18, 2012 at 12:18 am 
Thanks for your story, Crystal! I hope the other people above who promised to send in their own reports on vinegar go ahead and let us know.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Feb 21, 2012 at 1:58 pm 
For me I would be carefull yanking the metformin.

While desireable to get off meds, science/medicine has yet to explain why as body ages, diabetes appears to get worse as liver/pancreas/skeletal-fat cells age and the need for meds.

In type 2 diabetes stages, the body glucose setpoint off set as exibited in pre diabetes seem to ammeanable to only carb control and hearty exercise. It is unclear as to wheather this will continue as the body and organ set ages.

For me, as a old goat of 64+ and 30 years as type 2 diabetic; today once corrective action of metformin is done, energy balance of carbs control and daily hearty exercise is still critical to stopping the rot and maintaining good regulation.

I was at point that my liver’s excess glucose release monkey shines easily over whelmed a 1200 calorie diet and 2 miles walking. Once met fix in, rot stopped and carbs control of 1200 calories a day and 2 miles walking absolutely critical to maintain good regulation.
 Posted by jim snell | Feb 22, 2012 at 12:37 am 
I’m new to all of this, was diagnosed as a pre-diabetic a few months ago. There is a lot of confusing info out there, and I’m trying to figure out what’s best for me. I’m eating better, quit drinking, exercise 3-4 times a week and lost 15 lbs. My blood sugar levels are down but not enough.
I don’t like taking drugs when a more natural remedy is a possibility, so I will try the vinegar. I have the most trouble with my FBS so I will head to the store and get some pickles, which I like, and try those as a bedtime snack. It certainly is an easy thing to try. I can make my own salad dressing with the vinegar and have that with dinner. I’ll be really interested to see if this helps.

Thanks everybody.

I am drinking 2 capfuls of raw, organic apple cider vinegar mixed with 1 cup of water 3x a day and have been since November. This started as a final attempt to control knee joint pain from osteoarthritis. The results/benefits are undeniable. The first week I started, I noticed was how well I was sleeping and how my energy levels increased throughout the day; I wasn’t tired anymore. Then, by the second week, I noticed that my sinuses had cleared up and remain clear; no colds either. By the 3rd week, my appetite was supressed, my mood swings from whacky blood sugar levels were gone and finally, NO JOINT PAIN. I have not taken an Alleve or any other type of pain medication since November. I’m a 47 yr old female who has been taking Apple Cidet Vinegar for 4 months and feel better now than I have in years. No drugs for me. Just vinegar!

My mother is Vietnamese, and my father is German. Growing up I ate more than my fair share of rice seaweed and vinegary soy-sauce for a daily snack. I was always thin, it didn’t matter what I ate (much of that is attributed to an adolescents metabolism but when I moved out and got a job at a fast food restaurant all that changed. Vinegar was no longer in my diet. I mostly had fried food, burgers, and ranch or creamy ceasar on my veggies. Over a course of 2 years I blew up like a balloon! A few years later, my diet has significantly changed but my size and shape has not. After having 3 month long missing cycles and finally missing my cycle for 6 months I went to the doctor. They told me, after a few blood tests, that I had PCOS and was Insulin Resistant and close to being pre-diabetic at 23 and 150 pounds. It goes like this, I developed Insulin Resistance which caused a hormone imbalance, which caused PCOS, which pushed the hormone imbalance (not enough estrogen and to much testosterone), which caused weight gain, which exacerbated the Insulin Resistance. I knew that diabetes ran in the family, but I found out later that IR and PCOS also ran in the family. Altering my diet to that of a Gluten Free person I started to see some health changes. No more bloating, acne is diminished, less fatty fingers and feet (swollen). My cycle is not back to normal by typical standards but it is more frequent than 6 months apart. Recently, I’ve had huge cravings for cucumbers and vinegar, and my old seaweed rice vingar soy-sauce snack. (heads up GF folks Soy Sauce has Gluten in it found that out the other day, Poo) So I decided to try it out. I googled my craving and read that Vinegar has all these benefits. I’m definitely going back to my old daily snacks + this cucumber goodness :). I’ve also read that Chromium helps too, so I might try that out. Thanks for the fabulous info!
I hope my renewed love of vinegar brings back a semblance of my previous healthful regularity!
 Posted by Amanda | Mar 25, 2012 at 4:26 pm 
Also my doctor tried to get me to take metformin and/or BC to regulate hormones. I told them I’d think about it and get back to them later. I went home googled natural solutions. Found the Gluten Free diet (we go all out at my house) and told them I don’t want their pills. They never mentioned anything about vinegar or other homeopathic vitamins or solutions (like chromium supplements)But they sure were pushy on those prescriptions! Sheesh
Due to the heavy ticket price I am hesitant to get another round of blood tests to confirm that what i’m doing is helping. So I’m just hoping and going off of how healthy I feel.
 Posted by Amanda | Mar 25, 2012 at 4:33 pm 
I have had gastric bypass surgery (which did NOT affect my insulin dependent Type II in any positive way at all) so I have only a bit of stomach. I fear this vinegar regiman will detsroy what little stomach I have left. Any suggestions?
 Posted by Pat Weiser | Mar 28, 2012 at 12:44 pm 
Last October 2011, I was diagnostic with Pre-Diabetes type 2, the first test came with 102, I”m no taking any medication my Dr. told me that I was so stressful and that is one of the cause that you can have Diabetes, I did not keep a diet but a couple of days ago I test my blood sugar and I had 124, this number scare me and I started a diet, I hear about the ACV for lower the blood pressure that I already have and also high cholesterol, but after reading your article I’ll start taking the ACV, long time ago I tried at night with dinner but gave me acidity, so I will try it during the day, I believe it will help, but still will be Ok even I’m not taking any Diabetes medication?
Thank you.

S Carr, yes you could try this with or without diabetes medication. Take with food to protect your stomach.

I DIDN’T KNOW THAT VINGER WOULD HELP AND WILL IT ALSO WORK FOR ALWAYS STAYING COLD I’D LIKE TO KNOW MORE
 Posted by MISHCHEREL MAYE | Apr 02, 2012 at 8:34 pm 
ALSO WHAT ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT WILL IT HELP THAT TO WHAT ELSE WILL IT HELP CAN I AND HOW DO YOU TAKE IT AND WHAT WITH. I’M SO INTERESTED LIKE NOW.
 Posted by MISHCHEREL MAYE | Apr 02, 2012 at 8:46 pm 
Are you supposed to take 2 tablespoons of vinegar before EACH meal? e.g. Breakfast, lunch, dinner?

Thanks
 Posted by Rosalinda | Apr 02, 2012 at 10:42 pm 
Apple cider vinegar has been recommended for weight loss many times. I’m not familiar with the science on it. I’m more concerned with reducing blood glucose, which it does. Do a search for vinegar weight loss and you’ll get a lot of info.

Rosalinda, you don’t have to take two tablespoons of straight vinegar before meals. You can take it with meals or at bed time. I would take it anytime I’m having much carbohydrate. Probably best to take it with food or something to protect your stomach, unless you happen to be one of the people who like it. If two tablespoons seems too much, you could start with one tablespoon.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Apr 03, 2012 at 11:58 am 
i&amp;my mother will start this vinegar medication. thanks for this article.it is of great help.

Hi David im a heart transplsnt recipient and im also type2 diabetic. My sugar levels are 220 to 300 plus;I want 2 lower my blood sugar levels and bring down my A1C.I was looking up online and seen your comments. Im on diabetic meds and heart transplant meds as well is 20 grams of ACV ok to take b4 every meal? I also want too lose weight im 260lbs because i was on steroids 4 a few yrs my goal is to get back @ my old weight 215lbs. How much ACV should I take to start?
 Posted by Ed Rodriguez | Apr 17, 2012 at 10:16 pm 
Hi Ed,

Vinegar is OK with all diabetes meds I am aware of. I don’t know about“heart transplant meds”though. You might ask your pharmacist about that. Twenty grams of apple cider vinegar before meals and possibly at bedtime will likely help you with weight and glucose, but I can’t guarantee. 20 grams = 1 1/3 tablespoons. You might want to cut way down on sugars and flour and eat more green vegetables, too.
 Posted by David Spero RN | Apr 18, 2012 at 11:40 am 
I have not been able to get my BS below 200 for over a week. I was craving pickles. After eating a pickle and drinking 1/4 cup of pickle juice, my BS is at 170. After feeling better and thinking it was the juice, I went online to find the effects of vinegar on BS levels and I found this site. I have officially started the vinegar regimen tonight and will keep you informed of my results. I’m so excited to have found this! And all because of a craving. :))

Hello David
Very informative article with full of boldness.
As you suggested that two spoons of venigar should be taken before lunch and before bed, but my sugar is not high. Is it possible that I can reduce the amount of venigar?
 Posted by taurean | May 12, 2012 at 12:00 am 
Vinegar dosing is not an exact science, Taurean. Read some of the comments above and decide what’s right for you.
 Posted by David Spero RN | May 14, 2012 at 11:57 am 
Most interesting. Article on web (Johnston)

suggests that the vinegar causes some of the carbs to be bypassed out of system undigested.

They suggest that the vinegar interfers with some of the carbohydrate enzymes causing some of cabs bypassed out.

If that is true that would certainly account for an improvment in a system that trys to grab all carbs ingested.

Can I take vinegar along w/my BP and diabetes meds and ProArgine supplement?
 Posted by Perihan | May 18, 2012 at 11:21 am 
For those taking the vinegar straight, it is best to sip it with a straw. Reason? Vinegar is very acidic and does havoc to your teeth.
 Posted by Joel Garcia | May 28, 2012 at 9:39 pm 
I read in above post about taking vinegar and baking soda together. As a preschool teacher this is what we mix together to create“volcanos”, if you put a little food coloring in the kids love how it bubbles up and looks red like a volcano.
I am also going to try the vinegar, sans baking soda.

Thanks Kathleen
 Posted by Kathleen | Jun 07, 2012 at 8:23 pm 
I suggest to those who take vinegar to use Braggs Oragnic Raw Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar from the Health Store or GNC. It is gluten free and contains no preservatives. It is not as harsh as cooking vinegar and I definitely would not take white vinegar!
