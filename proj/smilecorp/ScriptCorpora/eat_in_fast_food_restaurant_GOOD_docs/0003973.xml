 [ edit ] George Carlin/Janis Ian&amp;Billy Preston [1.01] 
 English teacher : I want you to feed your fingertips. Foreigner : I vant you to feed your fingerteeps. English teacher : To the wolverines. Foreigner : To the volver-eenes. George Carlin : Thank you! Talk about a live show! It&apos;s nice to see you, welcome, and thanks for joining us- live! Um... I&apos;m kinda glad that we&apos;re on at night, so that we&apos;re not competing with all the football and baseball. So many, man... and this is the time of year when there&apos;s both, you know? Football&apos;s kinda nice, they changed it a little bit- they moved the hash marks in. Guys found it and smoked them, anyway! But you know, football wants to be the number-one sport, the national pastime. And I think it already is, really, because football represents something we are- we are Europe Junior. When you get right down to it, we&apos;re Europe Junior. We play a Europe game. What was the Europe game? (high voice) &quot;Let&apos;s take their land away from them! You&apos;ll be the pink, on up; we&apos;ll be blue, the red and the green!&quot; Ground acquisition. And that&apos;s what football is, football&apos;s a ground acquisition game. You knock the crap out of eleven guys and take their land away from them. Of course, we only do it ten yards at a time. That&apos;s the way we did it with the Indians- we won it little by little. First down in Ohio, Midwest to go! George Carlin : The term Jumbo Shrimp has always amazed me. What is a Jumbo Shrimp? I mean, it&apos;s like Military Intelligence- the words don&apos;t go together, man. George Carlin : Did you ever dial the phone and forget who you&apos;re calling? Don&apos;t you feel dumb? You don&apos;t know whether to hang on and hope you remember the voice or not.. Then when you remember who it was, you have to call back, so you change your voice so they don&apos;t think you&apos;re a moron. Chevy Chase : Our top story tonight: dedication ceremonies for the new Teamsters Union Headquarters building took place today in Detroit, where Union President Fitzsimmons was reported to have said that former President Jimmy Hoffa will always be a cornerstone in the organization. Chevy Chase : (President) Ford was on the campaign trail, announcing in Detroit that he had written his own campaign slogan. The slogan: &quot;If He&apos;s So Dumb, How Come He&apos;s President?&quot; 
 [ edit ] Paul Simon/Art Garfunkel, Randy Newman, Phoebe Snow, Jesse Dixon Singers [1.02] 
 Chevy Chase : Good evening, I’m Chevy Chase, here to keep you up on what’s going down! President Ford’s regular weekly accident took place this week in Hartford, Connecticut, where Ford’s Lincoln was hit by a Buick. Alert Secret Service Agents seized the Buick and wrestled it to the ground. The president was unhurt except for putting his thumb in his eye. Alert Secret Service Agents seized the thumb and wrestled it to the ground. Paul Simon : [to Marv Albert before his match with Connie Hawkins] I&apos;ve gotta stay with my strengths, basically... singing and songwriting. 
 [ edit ] Rob Reiner/Joe Cocker (John Bellushi) [1.03] 

 [ edit ] Candice Bergen/Esther Phillips [1.04] 
 President Ford : My fellow Americans... ladies and gentlemen.. members of the press... and my immediate family. First, may I thank you all for being here. And I am in my immediate family. First, may I thank you all for being here. And I am in my immediate family. Thank you all for being here, and I am truly honored to be asked by you to open the &quot;Saturday Night&quot; show with Harvey Cosell. Chevy Chase : Good evening, I&apos;m Chevy Chase and you&apos;re not. 
 [ edit ] Robert Klein/ABBA, Loudon Wainwright III [1.05] 
 Chevy Chase: And now, as a public service to those of our viewers who have difficulty with their hearing, I will repeat the top story of the day, aided by the Headmaster of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing, Garrett Morris. Our top story tonight... Garrett Morris : OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT!!! Chevy Chase : President Ford flew to Paris for a summit conference, and boy, are his arms tired! Garrett Morris : PRESIDENT FORD FLEW TO PARIS FOR A SUMMIT CONFERENCE, AND BOY, ARE HIS ARMS TIRED!!! Chevy Chase : Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow. Garrett Morris : GOOD NIGHT, AND HAVE A PLEASANT TO-MOR-ROW! Chevy Chase : Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has been cited for contempt of Congress! Kissinger commented, “So what? Congress has at least as much contempt for me as I do for him. Besides, Nixon lied, didn’t he? And he gets to sunbathe while I get terminal jet lag.” Chevy Chase : A new book has been published and released, and it’s entitled, “Friends of Richard Nixon.” A short work, it is only one page longer than the work, “Famous Antarctic Television Personalities of the Eighteenth Century.” Of his former boss, President Ford said, “Well, I spent most of the week reading it, finding it challenging in its scope.” Chevy Chase : The United States... hold it... The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism. Black entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr., a convert to Judaism, was quoted as saying: “What a breakthrough! Now, finally, I can hate myself!” 
 [ edit ] Lily Tomlin/Howard Shore and His All Nurse Band [1.06] 
 Chevy Chase : The FCC announced today that for every Ford commercial run on television, a minute of an old Ronald Reagan film must be shown. As a result of this action, a spokesman for George Wallace responded by demanding equal time by showing one minute of &quot;Ironsides.&quot; Chevy Chase : Later, Mr. Ford pierced his left hand with a salad fork at a luncheon celebrating Tuna Salad Day at the White House. Alert Secret Service agents seized the fork and wrestled it to the ground. Chevy Chase : Good evening. I&apos;m Chevy Chase, and you&apos;re not. The top story tonight: The Senate Intelligence Committee has revealed that the CIA has been involved in no less than nine assassination plots against various foreign leaders. Commented President Ford upon reading the report, quote, &quot;Boy, I&apos;m sure glad I&apos;m not foreign.&quot; Lily Tomlin : Being a New Yorker means never having to say you&apos;re sorry. 
 [ edit ] Richard Pryor/Gil-Scott Heron [1.07] 
 Richard Pryor : How you doin&apos;? Thank you very much for coming here to New York. Uh, hope I&apos;m funny. I&apos;d like to dedicate this to, uh, show to Miles Davis , my friend. He&apos;s in the hospital, sick. But he&apos;s cool. Miles always gets women, though, &apos;cause he talks so cool. You know, Miles go: [scratchy whisper]&apos; &quot;What&apos;s happenin&apos;?&quot; I get women, too. I can&apos;t keep &apos;em but I get &apos;em. Women always leave me, man! I don&apos;t mind &apos;em leavin&apos; but they tell you why. You know what I mean? Just leave! Don&apos;t tell me why! &apos;Cause there ain&apos;t nothin&apos; you can do but stand there and look silly, right? You be ... [imitates a man standing there and looking silly: points to himself in surprise, shrugs helplessly, rolls his eyes, shakes his head in disbelief] And the madder you get, women get cool when you get mad. [as an angry man] &quot;WELL, GO ON AND GET OUT THEN!&quot; [as a cool, calm woman] &quot;I&apos;m leaving.&quot; [as the man] &quot;I DON&apos;T EVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!&quot; [as the woman] &quot;Don&apos;t worry, you shan&apos;t.&quot; Richard Pryor : Drive you to drink, jack, you know? I tried drinkin&apos; for a while but I used to go into bars and check out the people that were drinkin&apos; and they weren&apos;t happy. And they get beat up a lot. No -- drunks, they start out cool. Brother be cool at first and he goin&apos;: &quot;Give me a Scotch and soda, please.&quot; Real cool. &apos;Bout a hour later: &quot;WHAT?! WHAT YOU MEAN I&apos;M DRUNK?! HUH? I wasn&apos;t drunk when I came in here! And I ain&apos;t gonna leave till I&apos;m sober. Now, you can dig that, baby. [During a word association exercise as part of a job interview] Interviewer : Dog. Mr. Wilson : Tree. Interviewer : Fast. Mr. Wilson : Slow. Interviewer : Rain. Mr. Wilson : Snow. Interviewer : White. Mr. Wilson : ...Black. Interviewer : Bean. Mr. Wilson : Pod. Interviewer : Negro. Mr. Wilson : Whitey(!). Interviewer : Tarbaby. Mr. Wilson : [pause] What&apos;d you say?

 Mrs. Henderson : [calling upstairs] Honey?! Did you send for interior demolitionists?!

Now we are getting somewhere. What do you think about this? Vito Corleone : Drugs, I am against. Chevy Chase : Well, as the primaries approach, more and more varied candidates are joining the fight for the Democratic ticket. The latest entry is Senator Robert Byrd. Byrd was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan, but says now that he deeply regrets that association. Byrd has been quoted as saying: &quot;I don&apos;t judge a man by the color of his skin; I judge him according to the size of his nostrils.&quot; Chevy Chase : Meanwhile, Sargent Shriver, stressing his close association with the Kennedy clan and his affinity for the Trumans&apos; straightforwardness, has written his campaign slogan: &quot;The Duck Stops Here.&quot; Asked if this plans would affect a Kennedy draft, Shriver commented: &quot;I do not believe this year that Teddy Kennedy will throw his hat into the water.&quot;

 Chevy Chase : Well, on the warmmer, happier side of life, far from the stories which seem sad or tragic, baby gorilla Boom-Boom was flown by Concorde from Paris to Washington last Thursday, to join the Ringling Bros. Barnum and Bailey&apos;s Zoo&amp;Circus. Boom-Boom enchanted passengers and stewardesses during the three-and-a-half hour flight by dancing in the aisles, making cute noises, and breaking into the cockpit and ripping apart the face of the captain, mutiliating the navigator, and crash-landing the jet in Greenland.

[audience cheers and applauds] Though thrilled about today&apos;s victory, millionaire-owner George Steinbrenner, in what he said was a precautionary move to ensure another world championship, purchased the entire Los Angeles Dodgers team, and immediately enstated Billy Martin as the Dodgers&apos; manager for the rest of the series. Bill Murray : Punk rock star, Sid Vicious, was arraigned yesterday in the night of the killing of his girlfriend.

 Jane Curtin : This past Thursday was the Great American Smoke Out, a day that everyone in America was encouraged to stop smoking cigarettes for a twenty-four hour period. Here to comment further is Update health correspondent, Roseanne Roseannadanna. Rosanne Rosannadanna : Thanks a lot, Jane! Thanks a lot! A Mr. Richard Feder from Fort Lee, New Jersey, writes in and says &quot;Dear Rosanne Rosannadanna, Last Thursday, I quit smoking. Now, I&apos;m depressed, I get wet, my face broke out, I&apos;m nauseous, I&apos;m constipated, my feet swell, my gums are bleeding, my sinuses are clogged, I got heartburn, I&apos;m cranky, and I have gas. What should I do?&quot; Mr. Feder you sound like a real attractive guy. You BELONG in New Jersey! But I know exactly what you&apos;re goin&apos; through &apos;cause once, I, Roseanne Roseannadanna, quit smokin&apos;. And to get back in shape, I had to join one of those fancy-shmancy health clubs. You know, the ones where it&apos;s real expensive to join but it&apos;s worth it, &apos;cause you get to see a lot o&apos; people that you don&apos;t know naked! Like, some people got those bulgy-bulgy thighs, the ones that get chafed just &apos;cause they&apos;re always scrapin&apos; against each other. And there&apos;s other people there that got these funny belly buttons. Like, some go in and some go out or it&apos;s like a hole or it curls around or it&apos;s like a little knob on it, like a door. Some of them got a little piece of their sweater still in it! Some of &apos;em look like a little star or a shell or a clam. Or some, you don&apos;t what they are! But, personally, I, Roseanne Rosannadanna, don&apos;t like to walk around with no clothes in front of other people! Not that I don&apos;t got a great body. But why should I waste it on a bunch of fat ladies in a health club? Anyway, they got this sauna there which is a little hot room where you go to sweat like a pig. So, I go in there, but before I sit down, I put this clean towel on the bench &apos;cause there&apos;s a lot of people in there and you don&apos;t know where they been! So, listen to this. Who do you think is sitting next to me but Dr. Joyce Brothers! That very smart pixie lady who thinks she knows everything. But what this nude psychologist doesn&apos;t know is that she had this little teeny tiny ball o&apos; sweat right here, hangin&apos; off the tip of her nose! It was just hangin&apos; there! It wouldn&apos;t fall off! Like, if she turned her head, it didn&apos;t fall off; if she stood up, it didn&apos;t fall off; she scratched, it didn&apos;t fall off; and when she picked a little piece of sweater out of her belly button, it didn&apos;t fall off! That little sweat ball just wouldn&apos;t fall off! So I yelled at her. I said, &quot;Hey! Doctor! Flick that sweat ball off your nose! What are ya tryin&apos; to do? Make me sick?!&quot; She... Jane Curtin : Roseanne! Roseanne Rosannadanna : What? What? Jane Curtin : What do health clubs, sweat and saunas have to do with cigarettes? Roseanne Rosannadanna : Well, Jane. It just goes to show ya. It&apos;s always somethin&apos;. If it&apos;s not one thing, it&apos;s another! Either you smoke or you have a sweat ball hangin&apos; off your nose! It&apos;s just like the song we used to sing on Thanksgiving when I was a little girl. Everybody would come over to my house lookin&apos; all pretty and cute and everything. My mother would make a turkey with stuffing and for dessert we&apos;d have the traditional Banana Rosannadanna cake. Before we ate, we&apos;d bow our heads. Bow your head, Jane. Come on, bow your little head. Come on. Jane, bow your head. Bow your head now. [Jane bows her head] We&apos;d bow our heads and we&apos;d all sing.
 [singing] We gather together to ask the Lord&apos;s blessing
Please look down upon the Roseannadanna household
Bring peace to our fathers, good health to our mothers
And please don&apos;t make me sweat like Dr. Joyce Brothers!
Amen!

 Fred Garvin : Call me... Fred Garvin, Male Prostitute. [Shows title card while 20&apos;s music played over it] Bill Murray : So if you&apos;re a Rhesus Monkey and you want to donate your body to science, please hop in the box and send yourself to &quot;Rhesus Roundup, San Simian, California.&quot; Dan Aykroyd : I&apos;m station manager Dan Aykroyd. During the past few weeks in Los Angeles, actor Lee Marvin and his former live-in companion Michelle Triola Marvin have been in court to settle her claim that he owes her half his income from the six years they lived together. That is a subject of tonight&apos;s Point-Counterpoint. Jane will take the pro-Michelle Marvin point, while I will take the anti-Michelle Triola counterpoint. Jane Curtin : Dan, times change and so does the nature of relationships. People are reluctant to get married these days and looking at divorce statistics, who can blame them. But the lack of a piece of paper does not necessarily mean a lack of total commitment. A woman is this modern-day relationship may well give up all her personal pursuits, as Michelle Marvin claims she did, to give her full support to her man&apos;s career. And Michelle Marvin is just asking that the courts recognize that reality. Dan, there&apos;s an old saying: &quot;Behind every successful man there&apos;s a woman.&quot; A loving, giving, caring woman. But you wouldn&apos;t know about that, Dan, because there&apos;s no old saying about what&apos;s behind a miserable failure. Dan Aykroyd : Jane, you ignorant slut! Bagged-out, dried-up, slunken meat like you and Michelle Triola know the rules. If you want a contract, sign on the dotted line. Oh, but let&apos;s shed a tear for poor Michelle Triola. There was only testimony that she had sexual intercourse over forty times with another man while living with actor Lee Marvin. But I suppose that sort of fashionable promiscuting means nothing to you, Jane, who hops from bed to bed with the frequency of the cheap ham radio. But hell hath no fury like a woman&apos;s scorn, and Michelle Triola, like a screeching, squealing, reptatious swamp sow is after actor Lee Marvin&apos;s last three million dollars. I guess what you and Michelle are saying is that when you&apos;re on your backs, the meter is running. Well, please spare us, gals, and tell us the rate&apos;s at the top. Then we can choose which two bit tarts and bargain basement sluts to shack up with.

Milton Berle : [in response to a sudden noise from the band stand] NBC just dropped another show. Bill Murray : In Britain, where political campaigns are often a source of unmistakenly British wit, we have this from Prime Minister James Callaghan. Commenting on the likely defeat of his Labour Party by the Tories in the upcoming British election, Callaghan quipped: &quot;When I congratulate Mrs. Thatcher, I won&apos;t know whether to clasp her hand or hand her a clasp!&quot; When asked to explain that joke, Callaghan replied: &quot;By the term &apos;clasp&apos;, I mean, of course, a paper clip, such as much be used to hold together the various important papers and documents which, as Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher would very likely be handling.&quot; [Bill chuckles] There&apos;ll always be an England!

 Al Franken : After five golden years, Lorne decided to leave. And so did those close to him, including me, Al Franken. [His name appeared on screen] So, NBC wants to pick a new producer. Now, most knowledgeable people, as you might imagine, hoped it would be me, Al Franken. [His name appeared on screen again] But instead, without consulting the show&apos;s staff or cast, NBC picked Jean Doumanian. Now, I don&apos;t want to be cruel to Jean -- because it might make you think less of me, Al Franken. [His name appeared again] Anyway, it took NBC 12 shows to figure out their horrendous mistake. And a month ago, they fired Jean. Okay, now, who do they pick to rectify the original error? Someone like me, Al Franken? [His name appeared again] No, they picked Dick Ebersol. I know Dick, and I can tell you that he doesn&apos;t know Dick. Okay. Now, the show is going to be a little better. No english-speaking person could do the worst job than Jean. And I think it&apos;s time that we should get this tired old format off the air. So if you write for me, Al Franken. [His name appeared again] Just write to: Put SNL To Sleep, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York, 10020. And one more thing, me and Tom Davis are hosting Saturday Night Live next week, with musical guest, The Grateful Dead. So watch that. After that, don&apos;t watch it anymore. [Audience applauds] Chevy Chase : And that&apos;s the news, good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.

 Steve Martin : If I had one wish that I could wish this holiday season, it would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing together in the spirit of harmony and peace.
If I had two wishes that I could wish for this holiday season, the first would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of harmony and peace...and the second would be for $30 million a month to be given to me, tax-free in a Swiss bank account.
You know, if I had three wishes that I could make this holiday season, first, of course, would be for all the children to get together and sing, the second would be for the $30 million every month to me, and the third would be for all encompassing power over every living being thing in the entire universe.
And if I had four wishes that I could make this holiday season, first would be the crap about the kids, second would be for the $30 million, the third would be for all the power, and the fourth would be to set aside one month each year for an extended 31-day orgasm, to be brought about slowly by Rosanna Arquette and that model, Paulina somebody, I can&apos;t think of her name, of course my lovely wife could come, too. She&apos;s behind me 100% on this, I guarantee you.
Wait a minute, maybe that sex thing should be the first wish! So, if I made that the first wish, because, you know, it could all go boom tomorrow, and then what have you got? No, no, the kids singing would be great, that would be nice. No, no, who am I kidding! I mean, they&apos;re not gonna be able to get all those kids together! I mean, the logistics of the thing is impossible! It&apos;s more trouble than it&apos;s worth! So, we reorganize, here we go. First, the sex—we go with that; second, the money. No! We go with the power second, then the money, and then the kids. Oh, wait, oh geez! I forgot about revenge against my enemies! Okay, revenge against all my enemies, they should die like pigs in Hell! That would be the fourth wish! And of course, my fifth wish would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of peace and harmony. Thank you, everybody.

Interviewing Doctor : Is there centaur pornography? Centaur Doctor : Yes, there is centaur porn. Interviewing Doctor : If I were to watch centaur porn, but with a piece of cardboard covering the horse parts, would I find the female actresses attractive? Centaur Doctor : Probably, but you gotta remember: sooner or later, there&apos;s gonna be a horse penis in there. Chris Matthews : That&apos;s tough talk coming from a people whose only contribution to Western culture is Gerard Depardieu and that horny skunk!

 George W. Bush : (in a message to Osama bin Ladin) If you really wanted to win against me at something, you should have challenged me to a game of Scrabble. Or perhaps a beard-off, for you see, I don&apos;t have a beard. And when I do, it comes in all patchy. George W. Bush : Don&apos;t mess with Texas.

Cheered for the Yankees with my dad in Section 6
And after traveling, just dancing round the world
I still prefer a beer and whiskey with my friends on Rivington street
...
I miss every little thing about the city
Subway trains, the girls are pretty
Love the hot dogs on 72nd street
They’re tasty and they’re cheap
Was just a waitress on Cornelia
Now I’m living my dreams, baby!
Singing about my Poker Face
New York, It’s Saturday night!

 Zach : I really don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing here! I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking aboot. Excuse me -- I&apos;ve been in canada, opening up for Miles Davis...Kilometers Davis.
I like dark comedies. That&apos;s why I like the Wayans Brothers.
My girlfriend looks a little bit like Charlize Theron, and a lot like Dog the Bounty Hunter. She&apos;s writing a book about contemporary feminist theory. She let me read the manuscript and I got to say: It&apos;s pretty good for a girl.
I went to my school reunion not too long ago, and it was very weird...because I was home schooled. Just me there by a bowl of punch, listening to Kool and the Gang. Why I rented that limousine, I have no idea.
This woman said to me the other day, &quot;Zach, I like your beard,&quot; and I said, &quot;Look, I&apos;m Greek. This isn&apos;t a beard. This is part of my eyebrow.&quot;
 [To the band] Are you guys just gonna sit there? I thought we were gonna rehearse something. [The band joins him] There we go.
Sometimes I&apos;ll do something and I say to myself, &quot;That is so Raven.&quot; And then, other times I&apos;ll do something and I&apos;ll be like, &quot;That was not very Raven.&quot;
If you read my blog, you know I&apos;m a pilates freak. And by pilates, I mean waffles.
I&apos;ve been trying to quit drinking. The other day I drank a 12-pack of O&apos;Doul&apos;s, and I went riding around in my car and I got pulled over by a cop. He&apos;s like, &quot;Son, have you been drinking?&quot; And I&apos;m like, &quot;Uh, sort of.&quot; he said, &quot;What have you been drinking?&quot; and I said &quot;O&apos;Doul&apos;s, nonalcoholic beer.&quot; And he wrote me a ticket for being a gaylord.
I was reading on CNN.com today, before the show. You know that kid who had sex with his high school teacher about a year ago? I read online today that that kid died, today. He died of high-fiving. He was in a high-fiving accident.

 Seth Meyers : Where can tourists go if they&apos;re looking for a great time in New York City? Stefon : If you&apos;re looking for a good time, look no further. New York&apos;s hottest club is Crease. Club promoter Trannie Oakley has gone all out, and inside it&apos;s just everything—lights, psychos, Furbys, screaming babies in Mozart wigs, sunburned drifters with soap-sud beards... Seth Meyers : I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry, what? Stefon : You know, it&apos;s that thing where a hobo becomes a rich man, so they take the big bubble bath. Seth Meyers : I...think I know what you mean. But now Stefon, if people, like if a family of normal people were looking to see some of the classic New York sights, you know, like Central Park or places like that, Statue of Liberty, would you have any recommendations? Stefon : Yes. New York&apos;s hottest club is Wesh. Nine-year-old pimp Ichi Yakaguru is back with an all-new hot-spot that answers the question: &quot;What?&quot; This place has everything—trants, stilts, throw-up music, an albino that looks like Susan Powter, Teddy Graham people... Seth Meyers : I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry, could I stop you for a second? What are Teddy Graham people? Stefon : It&apos;s that think of like, when a guy has the stumpy arms but with the belly. Seth Meyers : Yeah, that&apos;s definitely not a thing. You&apos;re doing great, Stefon, but again, if we were talking about just regular, run-of-the-mill people, maybe from the Midwest, who were just looking to do something with their kids or their grandparents, if they were coming here, could you recommend someplace that would be fun for them? Stefon : New York&apos;s hottest club is Twice. Don&apos;t be thrown off when you&apos;re greeted at the door by a rabbi that looks like Joaquin Phoenix. you&apos;re at the right place. Club owner Robert Blake has thought of everything—goths, carnival barkers, groups of guys with Afros in graduation caps, human fire hydrants... Seth Meyers : What is a human fire hydrant? Stefon : You know, it&apos;s that thing of when high-waisted midgets have, like... [trying not to laugh] I know, I&apos;m doing great. It&apos;s that thing when high-waisted midgets have, like, the red pants and the big ass. Seth Meyers : Oh right, that thing. Look, Stefon, we asked you to come here and tell us about the fun touristy things, we were pretty clear on the phone. Places people, regular people could go on a spring weekend. Stefon : Right, mm-hmm. Seth Meyers : But I have to say the things you described sound like visions a dying gay man might have if he was under too many blankets. Stefon : Fair, fair. Seth Meyers : But you know what, Stefon? Your heart was in the right place, and I really enjoyed having you here. Stefon : Oh, yay!

 [ edit ] Emma Stone/Kings of Leon [36.4] 
 Seth Meyers : So, Stefon, right off the bat, it&apos;s great to see you. What did you do this summer? Stefon : All of it. Seth Meyers : So, Stefon, if someone is coming—relax, buddy, you&apos;re gonna do great. If someone is coming to the city this fall and wants to have the full New York experience—you know, do some fun stuff—where should they go? Stefon : If you&apos;re looking for an experience, look no further. New York&apos;s hottest club is Trash. As you step through the stainless steel doors of this meat-packing hot spot, you&apos;ll be greeted by none other than Pierre the Muslim Elvis impersonator. This club has everything—clones, freaks, sneezing, a Russian man on a prepaid cell phone, and anyone can get in. There&apos;s no password. At the door, just do the Cosby face. Seth Meyers : The Cosby face? Stefon : Yeah, uh... [Flashes his fingers in front of his face and pokes through wide-eyed] Seth Meyers : Well, that is nice of them to make it so easy for folks to get in. But Stefon, what about someone who...let&apos;s say they&apos;re coming to New York for the first time, and they wanna have one of those classic New York nights. Stefon : Yes, yes, I&apos;m with you. Seth Meyers : So where should they go? Stefon : Seth, New York&apos;s hottest club is Gush. Club owner Gay Dunaway has built a fantasy word... world that answers the question: &quot;Now?&quot; . This place has everything—geeks, sherpas, a Jamaican nurse wearing a shower cap, room after room of broken mirrors, and look over there in the corner. Is that Mick Jagger? No, it&apos;s a fat kid on a Slip &apos;n Slide. His knees look like biscuits... [Briefly breaks into laughter and covers his face] ...and he&apos;s ready to party. Seth Meyers : It was not Mick Jagger? Stefon : [fighting through laughter] No, it wasn&apos;t Mick Jagger, it was a fat kid with biscuit knees. Seth Meyers : Just wanted to double-check. Stefon, now the reason I wrote you and asked you to come back here... Stefon : A letter. Seth Meyers : I wrote you a letter &apos;cause that&apos;s the only way you&apos;ll communicate. I wrote you the letter and I asked you to come back here because New York is really making a push...tourism push for normal American families. Stefon : Yes, they are. Seth Meyers : They are, yes. Yes, so if you could just take a minute, and you don&apos;t have to do it now, but if you could take a minute and think of just some fun wholesome places, not for people like you, but for visitors —American visitors from normal middle America, we would really appreciate it. So just don&apos;t talk until you&apos;re sure you have it. Stefon : I got it already. New York&apos;s hottest club is Push! This club has everything—ghosts, banjos, Carl Paladino, a stuck-up kitten who won&apos;t sign autographs, Furkels... Seth Meyers : Do I wanna know? Stefon : Yes, you do. Seth Meyers : Furkels are... Stefon : Fat Urkels. Seth Meyers : Sure they are. Stefon : And after you&apos;ve been with one of those guys, you&apos;ll ask yourself, &quot;Did I do that?&quot; Seth Meyers : Stefon, if I were you, I&apos;d be asking myself that all the time. Stefon, not to belabor the point, but we were looking for fun activities a mom, a dad, a grandma, a grandpa, and some kids could enjoy. You instead took us on a tour of a coked-up gay Candyland. Stefon : That&apos;s accurate, that&apos;s accurate. Seth Meyers : But I think we&apos;ll have you back. Stefon : Hooray!

 Seth Meyers : Donald Trump, who claims to be testing the waters for a presidential bid, sparked controversy this week by demanding to see Barack Obama&apos;s birth certificate. Look, if Donald Trump wants to talk about Barack Obama&apos;s birth certificate, what do I care? Though if he loves America so much, why does he keep outsourcing the job of his wife? What bothers me is that he&apos;s getting so much attention for this fake presidential run. I know Trump thinks any publicity is good publicity, the same way he apparently thinks any hair is good hair. But why are the rest of us talking about this like he really might be President? If saying you were going to do something counted, my dad would be on the cover of Finished Basement Magazine .
I think the problem is that with this GOP field, Trump actually seems like a viable candidate, and conversely, all the candidates remind me of contestants on Celebrity Apprentice . Look, Newt Gingrich, you&apos;re a trusted conservative, you&apos;re a religious man, you brought divorce papers to your wife when she was in the hospital for cancer. [Singing] Two out of three ain&apos;t bad , that makes you Meat Loaf, and you&apos;re fired.
Mitt Romney, you basically created Obamacare in Massachusetts, and now you&apos;re running against it, so you&apos;re attacking the exact same thing you used to get ahead. You&apos;re Jose Canseco, and you&apos;re fired.
Rick Santorum, this week you said that the reason Social Security is insolvent is that America has aborted 1/3 of its children. Everything out of your mouth makes me say, &quot;WHAT?!&quot; You&apos;re Lil Jon, and you&apos;re fired.
Herman Cain, I don&apos;t know a single thing about you. You&apos;re John Rich, and you&apos;re fired.
Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann, sexy from a distance, crazy up close. Lisa Rinna and NeNe Leakes, you&apos;re fired, you&apos;re fired.
And finally, Donald Trump, you&apos;re bossy, you&apos;re entitled, you probably still listen to Burt Bacharach. You&apos;re Dionne Warwick, and you&apos;re fired.
