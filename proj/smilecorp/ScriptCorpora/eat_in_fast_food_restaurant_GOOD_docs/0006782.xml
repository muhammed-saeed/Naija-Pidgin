We stayed at Alta Crystal Resort in the&quot;Honeymoon cabin.&quot;Though we&apos;re not honeymooners, it was nice to have our own cabin pretty much&quot;away from it all&quot;in this small resort. The cabin is well set-up and very cool in a rustic way with lots of craftsman touches like big log beams and big windows. The kitchen has a small fridge, a stove&amp;oven, small dishwasher (nice to have), pots&amp;pans and dishes, coffee, tea. Adequate eating area: table&amp;chairs. Small living room with couch, gas fireplace (which we couldn&apos;t figure out how to use unfortunately), big windows overlooking a small stream. Bathroom with tub shower and very nice soaps, shampoos, etc., replenished every day. Upstairs is the loft with bed (not very big), plenty of drawers, TV, small deck w/chairs. Front porch/deck had small table&amp;chairs; outside in front of the stream was a nice place to sit&amp;listen to the water - we liked that a lot! The cabin also comes with soft cotton robes for your trip to and back from the pool or hot tub -- a nice touch!

We were there for one BBQ night, which was lots of fun; the food was excellent, and there was plenty of it, plus all you wanted to drink (beer, wine, sodas)! We also met another couple so had a pleasurable time there eating and talking. The resort asks for a reasonable per-person&quot;donation&quot;for the BBQ, but I noticed the bucket didn&apos;t have much in it when we added our contribution to it...I got the impression a lot of guests looked at it as a freebie.

Now here are the things that -- in my opinion -- could make Alta Crystal so much better! We looked forward to grilling some meals and assumed we&apos;d have a gas grill. There was a grill, but it was for charcoal and we had to BUY it at the resort store. There are no condiments except for salt, pepper and sugar, so if you want ketchup with your burger, be prepared to buy some or stock up ahead of time at your local fast-food restaurant. No mayo or mustard for sandwiches...no little jelly packets for toast... You are WAY in the boonies out here and the nearest good-sized town, Enumclaw, is a loooong drive, so you&apos;re stuck wtih buying food at their store (and it&apos;s pricey) unless you manage to stock up on everything you think you&apos;ll possibly need before you arrive.

If you&apos;re only staying a couple of days, probably not a problem, but I felt that for the price we paid, the cabin could have been better stocked. if you want to go out to eat, there&apos;s not much to choose from except Crystal Mountain&apos;s Alpine Inn restaurant. Because we were hiking a lot, I really wanted some fresh fruit, but the store is small and they typically don&apos;t stock perishables.

The resort has an internet connection, but I swear it must be dial-up! It was painfully slow, especially in the evening when more guests were trying to connect. So don&apos;t expect to do much looking at real-time weather data or emailing photos back home! Finally, I was surpirsed to learn that I&apos;d be charged $1 for each toll-free call or local made from the cabin. There&apos;s very limited cell service (we&apos;d have to stand outside by the side of the road to get a Verizon connection!) so I used a calling card, but was dinged a dollar every time I used the phone.

Back to the positives: the location is great! We were very close to Rainier&apos;s Sunrise entrance, and it was only about a 45-minute drive to Paradise. If you like to hike, both of those areas have so much to choose from. We also hiked the Naches Peak Loop trail, which is only a few miles from the resort and was a highlight!

The staff at Alta Crystal is superb! Everyone is friendly and helpful and polite and enthusiastic...top-notch!

Ask Cindy B about Alta Crystal Resort at Mount Rainier This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC. cadematoWashington, Co-owner at Alta Crystal Resort at Mount Rainier, responded to this review December 3, 2009 We very much appreciated this reviewer&apos;s kind words, and are happy to hear that she found us&quot;almost perfect&quot;-- although we would obviously prefer&quot;perfect&quot;.:)

We appreciate the suggestions and are always happy hear ideas from guests. We have a&quot;rule&quot;in our small grocery store that we try to stock items if they are requested 2 or more times and this has resulted in some great additions.

Actually, there are only three things in this review I would like to explain.

The first is the barbecue. We decided several years ago to do these on a donation basis (somewhat unusual for a hotel of any type) largely because we wanted to encourage guests to come out and meet each other. Many friendships have been forged over the years, and we love the fact that we see so many people exchanging email addresses, or making plans to hike together the next day.
Most guests donate to nominal amount we suggest and we depend on this to help us continue this activity. (We donate our labor, but try to cover food and beverage costs with donations.) The particular night the reviewer was with us was a night when a cycling group staying with us joined the barbecue, and they asked us to put their donation on their tab, which is why there wasn&apos;t much in the donation jug.

The second thing is our internet service. We have HughesNet satellite broadband as it is really the only thing available in our location. Satellite broadband is great for checking email and downloading files, but it is really slow for uploads, so we apologize if the reviewer was inconvenienced. If DSL or anything else becomes available, we will jump on it!

Finally, I would like to say that I think our grocery prices are extremely reasonable given out location and the prices I&apos;ve seen charged at other hotels where we&apos;ve stayed. For example, our frozen pizzas are only $7.50 each (vs. $10.50 each in Greenwater); our quality bread is only $4.50 per loaf (vs. $4.19 per loaf at the Safeway in Enumclaw), eggs are 25 cents each (vs. 20 cents each at Safeway in Enumclaw) and I could come up with many more examples. We made a conscious decision to try to keep grocery prices as reasonable as possible, given that a trip to the grocery store is 60 miles roundtrip and takes a minimum of 2 hours when shopping time is included. By the time we pay gas, time and the cost of maintaining coolers and freezers, I very much doubt we make a dime off of groceries. We also make every effort to stock fresh fruit, salads and vegetables.

Again, we sincerely appreciate this reviewer&apos;s kind words and suggestions.

I&apos;ve stayed at Alta Crystal many times over the years and I never get tired of it. The setting is exquisite - you&apos;re literally right in the middle of a national forest, with several hiking trailheads directly behind the resort. The staff is super-friendly and accomodating, and they always remember me from my previous visits. They plan fun activities for the guests like BBQ&apos;s, karaoke or hikes, and have bikes and snowshoes available for rent. They have a great little store so if you forget something, they likely have it. It definitely has a&quot;home away from home&quot;feel to it. Great place to get away from it all.

It&apos;s a very nice hotel, located in a beautiful sorrounding, so close to the [Mt. Rainier] park entrance. But it&apos;s really expensive. Prices for this hotel are the same than for a luxury lodge but this is not a luxury accomodation. Room furniture and decoration is so old and sometimes cheap and need fixes, definitely.

Ask MacRobertson about Alta Crystal Resort at Mount Rainier This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC. flygirl500seattle seattle 1 review “Dated decor but great location and staff” Reviewed August 27, 2009 
Although we enjoyed our stay, overall we were disappointed with the state of the room. Pros-The staff is welcoming and kind and enjoy helping you with your daily itinerary/hikes. The location in the National Forest, only one mile outside Mt. Rainier&apos;s Sunrise entrance is fabulous. The barbecue (only offered on certain nights) was delicious and a wonderful value and bonfire was incredibly fun for our entire family. Also, great to have a pool after dusty hikes on the Mountain.
Cons-The one bedroom chalet suite seemed dated and dingy. Maybe the ski season guests give this place quite a beating? The fading fabric on the couch and armchair are in desperate need to be recovered or even slip-covered. Part of one plastic blind missing. Carpet was stained. Black stains above baseboard heater in bedroom. Peeling paint by the bathroom sink. Cereal found under living room couch cushions. Dirt in the sheets in one of the loft beds. One of the loft beds upstairs was so uncomfortable, my child said it was like lying on a table.

In this economy, the price seemed pretty steep for a room in such condition. My sense is that there is no competition in the area. Although you can&apos;t compare the beauty of the National Forest to NYC, I did pay the same rate for a pristine, perfectly clean and updated 2 room suite with 2 bathrooms (upgraded) in mid town Manhattan. All in all, The Alta Crystal Resort at Mt. Rainier is quite overdue for an update. Owners need to go through the rooms with fresh eyes and at the very least change the carpeting and the upholstery and toss the dried flowers collecting dust. Maybe the other rooms weren&apos;t in the same condition? Again, I would mostly recommend this place for the staff and location but not for the current quality of the rooms.

AG1593 Santa Clara, CA Contributor 13 reviews Reviews in 12 cities 28 helpful votes “Small, clean, well laid out rooms. Friendly, if pricey service.” Reviewed August 22, 2009 
We enjoyed our first visit to the Mt. Rainier National Park area, and our stay at Alta Crystal Resort was pleasant. We chose Alta Vista Resort because, traveling as a family with choosy eaters, we wanted a kitchen. Plus perks like a heated pool and hot tub sounded great. We were there for 5 nights, and the small size of the rooms and the less than great mattress in the &apos;master&apos; bedroom became progressively more noticeable. Thanks to Trip Advisor, we were prepared for the kitchen&apos;s limitations. We were glad we had shopped for groceries in Enumclaw on the way to the resort, because the nearest&quot;general store,&quot;15 minutes away, has little and is expensive. The resort itself sells food, and it&apos;s also expensive. We were disappointed with the hot tub, which wasn&apos;t hot and which wasn&apos;t clean the first day we were there. The pool also was cold and not clean the first day, but staff had both cleaned by the 2nd day and the pool was warmer, though the hot tub remained tepid, not hot. There were several BBQ dinners at the resort while we were there, and we enjoyed them greatly. There was a variety of tasty food, and host staff were genial. The big draw for the resort really is the surrounding open space and, of course, Mt. Rainier National Park. Mainly we hiked and enjoyed the scenery, which ranged from pleasant to stunning. If we were to return we&apos;d probably visit Alta Crystal again, but for a shorter stay.
