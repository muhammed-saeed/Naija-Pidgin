Fast-food restaurant is battling counterfeit money

 Raleigh, N.C.— Counterfeit money has prompted at least one Triangle-area fast-food chain to accept only small bills from customers.

Jason Bryan, who manages Cook Out on Capital Boulevard, said the restaurant&apos;s district office put the policy in place three weeks ago after several restaurants reported receiving fake money.

&quot;A couple of us have been hit with these fake bills, and we&apos;re just no longer taking anything larger than a $20,&quot; Bryan said Wednesday.

Most people cannot tell if a bill is counterfeit. Banks use a special light to examine bills, but small businesses generally don&apos;t have that technology.

Instead, they train their employees to use special pens, in which a mark on a bill indicates whether it is real.

But Bryan says it can be time-consuming.

&quot;It&apos;s costly,&quot; he said &quot;Somebody gets away. They come through with a tray for like $5 or $10, and they (pay with a counterfeit $100 and) make like a $90 profit.&quot;

The U.S. Secret Service estimates that less than 1 percent of bills circulating in the U.S. are fake.

 

It says that, as technology gets better, it also gets more difficult to spot counterfeit bills.

&quot;Some of them have gotten very, very good, where they take actual money, bleached all the ink off it and then reprinted it as a $100 bill,&quot; Bryan said.
