Ownership must have changed,as service and food were outstanding this visit. Our chef, Juan, was very entertaining. The atmospere was lively and fun. Lots of customers clapping and laughing.Not sure what has changed, but keep up the good work. Very enjoyable. Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem 1 of 1 Yahoo!

Was this review helpful? ( Yes — No ) Report a problem           USER RATING By H , 4/3/10 Been there 2 times. Got sick both times. Prices are too high. The place is always empty. Very very very small sushi menu and it&apos;s mediocre at best. My GF went there with her family and 5 people out of 6 got sick. They all had hibachi though.

If you enjoy your guts being inside your body, I would recommend against this place.

It&apos;s WAY worth the drive to Colerain to eat at Kabuto. 8,000,000 times better food, menu, price, quality... and I&apos;ve never heard of anyone getting sick from eating there.

Have heard of Benihana long before now and finally tried it out at this location. NEVER again. There was a long line but I told my wife and 3 year old kid that it is worth the wait. My wife, on the other hand, was hesitant as she said&quot;it looks like a fast food restaurant&quot;. As we finally got to go to the dining area, her comment started to hit me. The walkway was filthy with food scraps: rice, meat, napkins. The carpet was soaked with fluid and trash that it makes squishing noise when we walked. The hostess took us to a table as we were horrified looking at the cleaning guy pushed everything off the table (left-over food, napkins) with the above mentioned flying all over, some got on my trousers, before sweeping it off the floor. If he would throw most of the left-overs in the trash bin first, sweep the scraps after, he wouldn&apos;t have that much trash on the floor! One would think that management would train workers a bit better. Next, the food was not at all impressive. May be because we were disgusted with the filthy environment with old food scraps all over under my table, may be because of the food itself, I couldn&apos;t tell. Both my wife and myself are physicians and we love Japanese food. We try different restaurants everytime we travel and this is certainly not worth noting. I would say about average. The price, however, is on the more expensive side. I mean $22 per plate is on the above average range. That is not the problem as we know the price when we ordered. We, however, were not prepared for the hidden charges. The bill came with $3 extra per plate as the price of rice is additional. C&apos;mon, who orders hibachi without rice? At all the restaurants we visited, NEVER had anyone charged $3 for the rice that comes with Hibachi. It&apos;s like selling Sushi then charge for the rice that comes with it. We felt cheated that this is worse than highway robbery. We quietly paid anyway but weren&apos;t happy about it. The lady sitting next to us, however, was a lot more vocal. They started an altercation which wasn&apos;t very pretty. Through the complaint, we understood it was about the same hidden charge that she didn&apos;t agree to. To make matter worse, there were 6 kids in her party, that makes $21 over charge. Oh, I forgot to mention the ice-cream. They charged $5 for ice-cream. On the menu, it says that it is the same Edys ice-cream that you find in the gorcery store, nothing special. The ice-cream came out with 2 small scoops that didn&apos;t even satisfy my 3 year old boy! I mean $5 is half a gallon of Icecream already, we already paid for it many times over, give us 4-5 scoops to satisfy us, guys. Don&apos;t be too stingy/greedy. Need I say more? NEVER again, Benihana. Corporate, if you are monitoring this, please check this store out. It is a shame to your name. Was this review helpful?
