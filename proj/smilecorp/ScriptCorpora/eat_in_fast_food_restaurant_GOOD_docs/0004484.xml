No Stranger to the World of Violence, L.a. Police Chief Bernard Parks Faces the Killing of His Granddaughter Lori
 
 Facebook Twitter E-mail 
 As Los Angeles police chief, Bernard Parks is more accustomed than he&apos;d like to be to urgent phone calls bearing bad news. But nothing could have prepared him for the shock he received in the middle of the night on May 28, when an L.A. police official awakened him and his wife, Bobbie, 61, while they were in Charlotte, N.C., on a business trip. Their granddaughter Lori Gonzalez had been shot and killed while driving with a friend in her car in L.A., an innocent victim caught up in what is believed to have been a gang-related attack. &quot;It brings home how vulnerable people are,&quot; says a grief-stricken Parks, 56. &quot;Safety is a very tenuous thing.&quot; Just a week shy of her 21st birthday, Lori was the firstborn of the Parkses&apos; seven grandchildren. &quot;I was numb,&quot; says Parks of the moment he received the grim news. &quot;I was feeling helpless because I wasn&apos;t there.&quot;

Quickly, though, he managed to take charge and guide his family through the crisis. He didn&apos;t want his oldest daughter, Felicia Parks-Mena, 42, Lori&apos;s mother, to hear the news over the phone, so the chief woke his son Bernard Jr., 26, a TV news writer at L.A.&apos;s CBS station, and dispatched him to Felicia&apos;s home in Redondo Beach, near where she works as a baggage claim supervisor for Continental Airlines. When Bernard Jr. broke the news, his sister collapsed in tears. &quot;My mom and dad are the ultimate rocks,&quot; he says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t wait for them to get here—they handle stuff like that and the rest of us follow.&quot;

Lori had long had a special place in the family. Born to Felicia and her now-ex-husband Joe Gonzalez, 45, she had been named after Lori Parks, her grandparents&apos; second child, who had died of cancer at 16. (The Parkses have two other daughters: Michelle, 38, a customer service rep at a cable company, and Trudy, 35, an executive director of a youth organization in Las Vegas.) Though her parents split up when she was 3, Lori had enjoyed a happy childhood. She lived with her mother, but Lori and her father had remained close. In fact, three years ago she had moved in with Joe, who lives in Mission Viejo, so she could get to know his side of the family. She was blessed with a sunny disposition, and it was no secret in the family that she was one of her grandfather Bernard&apos;s favorites. &quot;She was the first granddaughter in the family, and there never seemed to be enough of her to go around,&quot; says Michelle. &quot;She was everybody&apos;s baby.&quot;

Recently, Lori had been working as an operator at Pacific Bell and as a clerk at a Sav-On drugstore. A first-year student at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, she had graduated from Universal College of Beauty and planned to open her own salon one day. &quot;She had a real interest in the beauty care business,&quot; says Bernard Sr. &quot;She would color her hair and put a different stripe in it. She loved to experiment.&quot; She was also known for giving her time generously to the community. In addition to helping build low-income homes in Mexico, she taught second-and third-grade Sunday school at Coast Hills Community Church in Aliso Viejo, just south of L.A. &quot;She was one of the most faithful, friendly, loving leaders we had,&quot; says Eric Nachtreib, an associate pastor at the church. &quot;It was not unusual, when she was reading a Bible story, to have a child or two nestled on her knee.&quot; For the past two years, Lori had been dating Bryan Small, 23, who works as an aircraft refueler, and the couple had been talking of marriage.

Apparently it was simple bad luck that brought Lori together with a young man, described as a childhood friend, on the evening of May 28. Lori and her friend, whose identity has not been released because he is a witness in the ongoing murder investigation, had been hanging out when they decided to get something to eat at a fast-food restaurant in south Los Angeles. As Lori, driving her light blue Chevrolet sedan, waited in the restaurant driveway before turning onto La Brea Avenue, police say the assailant approached on the passenger side with a gun raised. Lori&apos;s friend saw him and ducked, but the shooter, described as a heavyset black man in his 20s, opened fire, striking Lori several times in the upper torso. It turned out, according to newspaper reports citing police sources, that the man in Lori&apos;s car was a gang member who had been in a fight just three weeks before, raising the distinct possibility that the attack was an act of retaliation.

Early last week, police were still searching for suspects. For Lori&apos;s family, the agony of their loss was still almost too much to bear. As it happened, on the day his granddaughter was killed, Chief Parks had spoken to her by phone one last time. &quot;Lori never ended her conversation without saying &apos;I love you,&apos; whether you were with her in person or on the phone,&quot; he says. &quot;We talked for a few minutes, and then she said, &apos;I&apos;m going. I love you.&apos; And despite 35 years as an L.A. policeman, during which he has seen countless young men and women die tragic and pointless deaths, Parks, appointed chief in 1997, acknowledges that he is no better equipped than anyone else to make sense of his granddaughter&apos;s murder. &quot;You ask that question &apos;Why has it happened?&apos; he says. &quot;And there are no answers. You ask questions in your head, and most of them will be unresolved.&quot;
