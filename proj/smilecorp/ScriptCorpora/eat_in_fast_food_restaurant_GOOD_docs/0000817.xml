Tips for Kelly&apos;s Roast Beef
 Recommends Allie Beau Joined 2 years ago 4.0 April 26, 2010 
 LG BEEF, CHZ, SOS!. If you&apos;re a Kelly&apos;s virgin, do yourself a favor and order it up just like this:
Large roast beef, pickles, onions, cheese, horseradish, BBQ Sauce on the SIDE (on the bun makes it a touch too soggy)! Also I can vouch for the onion rings and cheese fries when you want to truly hate yourself but still smile at the end of a meal. Also my one friend is probably borderline retarded and ordered a salad...and it was really good!

It&apos;s a touch pricey for&quot;fast food&quot;but you definitely get what you pay for--good ingredients and big portions.

I only wish my friendly neighborhood roast beef vendor kept my aggressive weekend drinking schedule in mind and stayed open till 2ish? 3ish? 1AM ain&apos;t cutting it when we&apos;re still at the bar doing shots ;-) …

 kellys roast beef. how anyone thinks the food at this place is even close to good ,has been brainwashed by media and late night drunks that consider the absolute garbage they serve here as fantastic.IT is fantasticaly &apos;terrible&apos;. the lobstermeat,stil hlf frozen,watery and oversalty preservatves on a cold (toasted)roll.The roast beef was overcooked and rubbery again on a cold(toasted)roll.When I asked the mngr about it he basically explained it away by saying&apos; Well we sell alot so you must be wrong&apos;.Good answer,its all in my head,so the problem is mine ,deal withit.great way to run a business and i guess you no longer need my business.I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE WHOS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE AND BY NO MEANS AM I MAKING THIS UP …

 Clean dining room, nicer fast food experience. I had heard of Kelly&apos;s roast beef as a local restaurant and always thought it was a sit down table service kind of place. It isn&apos;t, it is counter ordering with table delivery. The food is good, and there are more options that a regular fast food restaurant. The staff is nice and the service is rapid. Kelly&apos;s has become one of my favorite quick places to stop for a bite. I have yet to have tried the roast beef, but the tuna is good, the chicken burger fresh, and the wraps are tasty. I suggest Kelly&apos;s as a great alternative to larger chains like BK or McDonalds. …

 great food, nice atmosphere for a&quot;fast food&quot;. I tried the lobster roll here - AMAZING - the lobster: bread ratio is crazy (meat from 2 lobsters!!)&amp;I love that they toast the bun also. The roast beef sandwich is also great, and served overflowing with meat. The fries taste home-style&amp;even the fountain coke tasted&quot;real&quot;.

It&apos;s a very nice, warm atmosphere for a&quot;fast food&quot;place. Great for families also. …

 REAL ROAST BEEF!!!. Now, coming from the west coast, there are some regional food that you only HEAR about... REAL Philly Cheesesteaks... REAL Italian Beef Sandwiches... REAL biscuits and gravy... etc. We do have Arby&apos;s Roast beef, but they are really only appropriate when nothing else sounds good. I happened across Kelly&apos;s on a trip to Boston, and I WAS FLOORED. I couldn&apos;t believe that the quality of meat and amount being served was in a&quot;fast food establishment.&quot;It was incredible. I even topped it with Horseradish and of course... A SIDE OF AU JUS. You can order it medium rare, and you find yourself grunting after each bite. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to satisfy an extreme hunger for a tasty meat sandwich. …
