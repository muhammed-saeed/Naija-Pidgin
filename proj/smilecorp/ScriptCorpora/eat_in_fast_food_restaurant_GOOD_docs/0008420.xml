Can I trasfer a hotel reservation to someone elses name, but pay for it myself?
 Ok, we made reservations to go to the nascar race in bristol, but now we have decided not to go this year, and want to ebay the tickets and the hotel. Not sure if it is possible to do that with the hotel. We haven&apos;t paid for it or anything, but gave a cc # when making the reservation. I think we would probably have to pay for it in advance if we were going to sell it. Anyone know if you can do that? Reply With Quote 02-04-2005,  08:42 PM #2 Binny89

 Moderator Join Date Mar 2001 Location Denver, Colorado Posts 11,021 OK I thought about this more last night and unless you have money on it, I would NOT do this!

Reason being, its your credit card. They could rack up all sorts of charges ( movies etc) and it would automatically go to YOUR card. You dont know what kind of person youre going to be dealing with and if your cc is the one on file you could wind up paying for damages and who knows what else.


I think if you can cancel and get your money back youre better off.


Good luck! Reply With Quote 02-05-2005,  12:51 PM #4 8Dalejrsgirl

 Registered User Join Date Jul 2001 Posts 1,168 That&apos;s kind of what I was thinking, but Dh wanted to do it. I didn&apos;t know if we could pay for the room, and then any other charges the people would have to pay for. Think you&apos;re probably right about it though.

 october Join Date Mar 2001 Location Beautiful, sunny California Posts 863 Would it be possible to use a prepaid debit card to hold the reservation. That way the charges couldn&apos;t go over X number of dollars. I am not sure if the hotel would let you do that b/c some check your credit card amount to make sure that you have the cost of the hotel + $$ for possible damages. Reply With Quote
