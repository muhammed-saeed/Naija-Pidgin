 13.14.100 Developer sewer extensions.

(a)    Any person or entity developing property, upon the agreement of the county, may connect such property to a county sewer by means of a sewer line paid for and installed by developer. This shall be known as a developer sewer extension.

(b)    Any developer desiring to connect to a county sewage system shall first make application therefor to the director. The director shall require the applicant to provide such information as he or she deems necessary. Such application shall, at a minimum, contain:

(1)    A description of the proposed development;

(2)    Calculations showing the number of residential equivalent units of sewage to be produced by the development;

(3)    Engineering drawings prepared by a licensed civil engineer depicting the proposed facility in detail.

(c)    As a condition of approval the director may require the proposed facility to have capacity greater than that needed to serve the proposed development but this shall only be required when:

(2)    The county is willing to bear the expense of the additional capacity.

(d)    As a condition of approval the director may require the developer:

(1)    To provide easements to the developer sewer extension lines so that others may have access to such lines;

(2)    To install sewer lines to the property line so that others may have access to the developer sewer extension lines without the future need to place a sewer line in an easement upon which surface improvements may be made.

(e)    If the application is approved by the director and after any necessary franchises are obtained, the developer shall proceed to construct the extension. During the course of construction the developer shall permit those inspections of the facility which the director deems necessary and, to this end, the developer shall notify the director when the facility or portion thereof is ready for inspection.

(f)    No developer extension shall be connected to a county sewer until the following have occurred:

(Ord. 113 (1986)§10, 1986)

 13.14.110 Developer extension payback contract

(a)    A developer making a developer sewer extension may apply to the county for a payback contract. Through such a contract a developer may recover a portion of the cost of the extension in the event some other person connects to such facility and is thereby obliged to pay a latecomer’s assessment pursuant to Section 13.14.070 . Prior to approving such a contract the director may require such information from the developer as he or she deems necessary. The director shall approve such a contract only when, in his or her discretion, it is in the county’s interests to do so.

(b)    The payback contract shall, at a minimum, specify the capacity of the facility in residential equivalent units, the number of such units reserved for use by the developer, and the actual cost to the developer of the facility.

(c)    No payback contract shall be valid for more than ten years.

(d)    In the event the county permits a person or entity to connect to a sewage facility covered by an existing developer extension payback contract, the county shall pay to the developer when such assessment is collected the amount of the latecomer’s assessment as that assessment is determined by Section 13.14.070 .

(e)    Prior to disbursing the latecomer’s assessment to the developer as contemplated by subsection (d) of this section, the county shall deduct its administrative costs which shall not exceed fifteen percent.

 13.14.120 Change in use.

(a)    When the owner or occupant of property connected to a county sewer makes a material change in the use to which the property is devoted or materially increases the intensity of the use existing upon the property and when such change or increase results in production of at least one additional residential equivalent unit of sewage, then the owner of the property shall pay the newcomer’s assessment as determined by Section 13.14.060 , the latecomer’s assessment as determined by Section 13.14.070 , and the monthly user fee as determined by Section 13.14.080 all based upon the increased sewage flow.

(b)    The owner of the property shall receive credits for newcomer’s assessments, latecomer’s assessments and similar assessments or fees already paid.

(c)    The owner shall pay or shall contract to pay the assessments required by subsection (a) of this section when the building permits are obtained for the uses which will increase the sewage production or, if no building permits are required, when the increased sewage is delivered to the county’s sewer system.

 13.14.140 Determination of residential equivalent units.

(a)    Each dwelling unit, each rental space in a mobile home park or trailer court, every church and every auto service station shall be one residential equivalent unit.

(b)    For uses other than those specified in subsection (a) of this section, a use shall have a residential equivalent unit for each eight hundred cubic feet of water consumed per month but in no event shall any use have less than one unit.

(c)    The determination of residential equivalent units as set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall be based upon the monthly average of metered water usage for the previous calendar year; provided, if the user can conclusively establish by clear and convincing evidence to the director’s satisfaction that some amount of metered water usage was used for irrigation purposes, then such amount shall be disregarded in determining residential equivalent units. If the water provided to a use is not metered or if the use does not have a history of water usage as required herein, then the residential equivalent units shall be determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section; provided, in the case of non-metered water supply or inadequate history thereof, if the user can conclusively establish by clear and convincing evidence to the director’s satisfaction what actual water usage has been or will be, then the units of residential equivalence shall be based on such evidence.

(d)    When water usage is not metered or when there is not an adequate history of water usage, a residential equivalent unit shall be based upon eight hundred cubic feet of water per month and shall be estimated by use of the following:

 13.14.150 Installment payment program.

Upon showing that payment of the newcomer’s assessment and/or latecomer’s assessment in full prior to connection to a county sewer would produce financial hardship, the director, in his or her discretion, may authorize payment of such assessments in installments; provided, this shall not apply to latecomer’s assessments involving developer extension paybacks pursuant to Section 13.14.110 . If so authorized at least ten percent of the assessments shall be paid prior to connection with the balance due in equal annual installments over a period of five years. The unpaid balance shall bear interest at eight percent per annum. There shall be added to any installment not timely paid a penalty in the amount of ten percent of the delinquent installment. In order to utilize this installment plan the owner of the property sewered must provide suitable instruments to the county creating a lien on the property to the extent of the balance owing plus interest and penalties.

(Ord. 113 (1986)§15, 1986)

 13.14.160 Phased development.

(a)    Any person or entity developing property in phases or developing property consisting of discrete units may elect to pay the newcomer’s assessment and/or latecomer’s assessment for such property as the several phases or units are occupied or sold or otherwise actually receive sewer service. Such election shall be accomplished through a phased development contract.

(b)    A phased development contract shall contain:

(1)    The name and address of the developer;

(2)    A legal description of the property;

(3)    A description of the nature and number of phases or discrete units within the development;
