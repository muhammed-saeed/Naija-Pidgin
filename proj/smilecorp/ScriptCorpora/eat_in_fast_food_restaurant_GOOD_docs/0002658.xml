How will slop buckets work for people outside the ivory towers?

Ministers want to put buckets for food waste in every home so it can be sent to recycling plants
 
Remarkably, the idea of slop bins is not a new one. My local council has been doing it for years. In fact, we have two bins–one for green, compostable waste, which goes into a compost bin, and one for all other food waste, which goes into a separate dustbin.

Operating the system isn’t actually that difficult. It isn’t too hard to remember that vegetable peelings go in one bin, bits of left over meat go in another and my two year old’s nappies go in neither.

But I am lucky. I have a back door that I can stick the smelly slop bin outside. I have a long garden that I can put the stinking bins at the end of. I don’t have the sort of pets that are likely to regard the bins as their own private fast food restaurant and any vermin round here are too busy hiding from my cats and the birds of prey which circle overhead.

The big question is: what is everyone else supposed to do? Has Hilary Benn–who, let us remember, is actually the son of a Viscount–ever even been inside a council flat, let alone wondered where on earth you are supposed to put a slop bucket? Waste food is always going to be a health hazard, one way or another, and yet Mr Benn wants to encourage us to keep it in the home.

The bigger problem, though, is the attitude of local councils to recycling. There’s no evidence of any sort of common policy among the various local governments, other than a grunting acceptance that recycling is a good thing.

 A slop bucket in every home: Ministers plan to impose fines if you don&apos;t recycle food waste RICHARD O&apos;HAGAN: Why should we pay to prove we&apos;re not child abusers? 
 

I have never understood why councils cannot collect all of the waste once a week on the same day, just like they used to in the days before wheelie bins. Making everyone keep food waste about the place makes it even more imperative that they do this.

There’s also the problem that no two councils have the same recycling policy. My current one collects paper, plastic and tin cans, but they don’t take glass. Go two miles down the road and the residents don’t have bins at all. Householders have black plastic bin bags to leave at the kerbside, which the local foxes then generously &apos;recycle&apos; all over the roads and pavements. On the other hand though, they do collect glass.

Until there is some sort of coherent policy relating to recycling generally, this idea simply isn’t going to work. And until the government tells us how it is supposed to work for people in all kinds of property, not just those in ivory towers, then it is never going to catch on anyway.

Like many of Labour’s recent policy announcements, this is a potentially good idea that simply hasn’t been thought through properly.

My family really wanted to use a slop bucket as we are a big family&amp;produce food waste. However, it was just too smelly to have in the house&amp;unpleasant to wash out the slop bucket.

I have a garbage disposal unit which chews everything into tiny pieces and sends it down the drain including chicken bones .Any other joint I buy now i get it boned first.I did this because our local authority threatened us with fortnightly collections so by using my GDU I do not throw any wet rubbish in the bin.I presume when my waste water reaches the sewage plant the extra nutrients speed up the process but I don&apos;t know for sure.

Its nothing new in my home I have a small waste bin for scraps which I feed to my wormery, any potatoes I have left are frozen and used in soups or other dishes. What is the problem with the government have they so little to do other than treat us like idiots. Do they not know WE CAN THINK FOR OURSELVES.

The answer is a simple one. Put all your rubbish in one bin as we used to, send this off to the local prison, and the inmates separate all the differing types of waste for recycling. Law abiding citizens have a stress free life whilst those that break the law are truly punished and serve a purpose while banged up at her Majesty&apos;s

Your comments:In communist China under Mao Tse Tung people had to wear Mao suits as a method of controlling the masses.
It was easy for the apparatchiks to identify and persecute those who could be a threat by their dress.
In Marxist UK we will all need a slop bucket. It will be easy to identify and persecute those who do not conform.

Just be patient, this bright idea will be in the trash can in the fullness of time, its impracticality will consign it to the bin.

Another&apos;slop bucket&apos;idea from a&apos;slop bucket&apos;government. 
Once upon a time one lorry and 4 men came and emptied my bin every week now 3 lorries and 12 men empty my bin. Looks like we may be getting another lorry and crew!
What value is the carbon foot print of that?
If Local Authorites invested in plasma gas incinerators they could destroy every thing safely and go back to one lorry and 4 men doing weekly collections. 
They could even use the heat generated to create sellable power!

It&apos;s a great idea. 
I live in a council flat and in common with most council blocks it has huge communal bins for the residents. It&apos;s not as if we have to keep our rubbish in our flats till collection day anyway so the spaciousness of our flats is irrelevant. The simple fact of separating our waste does not logically mean there is a higher volume of waste either.
The only problem is that Hammersmith&amp;Fulham won&apos;t collect organic waste from council blocks - only from houses.
