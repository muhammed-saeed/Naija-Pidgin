Effects of Eating Fast Food
 By: Jaceson Maughan 
The negative effects of eating fast food contribute to a host of health problems for both children and adults. Because most fast food has little nutritional value, people who eat it on a regular basis are not putting healthy foods into their bodies, thus depriving their bodies of vital nutrients. Fast food also contains some harmful substances that damage the body&apos;s health and wellness. Public awareness of the negative effects of eating fast food is rising, and restaurants are starting to offer some fast healthy food, including more vegetable and fruit choices. Before heading to the drive-thru, learn what problems a fast food meal can bring to the table.

 High Calories 
Fast food, generally considered to be food such as hamburgers, fries, pizza, fried chicken and similar items, contains lots of calories per meal. Fried foods actually contain twice the calories than before they were fried. If you compare a typical fast food meal with other same-sized meals that contain a more healthy balance of food groups, you&apos;ll find that the fast food is much denser than the alternative. Some fast food combinations can provide almost 100 percent of an adult&apos;s recommended daily caloric intake with just one meal.

 Fat 
Many fast food choices contain harmful fats that negatively affect the body. From fatty meats to fried food, fast food is full of trans fat that has been linked to coronary heart disease, strokes, obesity, liver damage and even cancer. Although the scientific evidence is not conclusive, high levels of trans fat consumption have been linked to diabetes, Alzheimer&apos;s Disease and infertility. Some cities have banned restaurants from cooking with trans fats, so you may want to check on trans fat policies on a city-by-city and restaurant-by-restaurant level.

 Non-Nutritive 
A fast food meal delivers plenty of unhealthy ingredients to the body, but it&apos;s also important to realize what a fast food meal isn&apos;t providing. Most fast food doesn&apos;t contain healthy ingredients like fiber, vitamins or minerals. Instead, processed food contains too much salt, sugar, artificial additives and preservatives. Replacing a healthy meal with a fast food meal deprives the body of essential nutrients that are a key part of a healthy, well-functioning body.

 Oversized Portions 
Clever marketing campaigns continually try to influence what kind of fast food to purchase and in what quantities. The acceptable meal sizes and portions that an adult should consume are ignored when it comes to fast food. Restaurants sell meals that are beyond average size, and then they give the customer the option for even bigger meal combinations. People get a false sense of an appropriate portion size, and they ingest even more unhealthy fast food in order to feel full.
