 Inspiration, Prayer and why we help others! 
 Jul 8 

At the check out line a bit ago, my step son told me–’Traci, you are an inspiration!’
 
Erik and Traci
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Coming from a 20-year-old that meant a lot to me, even when I don’t feel like that…

The reason for this is because I tell EVERYONE about my weight loss. This is not because I am vain. Ok, if I’m  TOTALLY honest I do struggle with this at times but it’s also because if I can reach ONE person whose struggling, who may need help who doesn’t THINK they can do it–that makes my day!

As I have told everyone, I have failed soooo many diets before I found Eat Clean and I am so grateful.

So many things have changed for me. I was reading on Transformations and a lady mentioned prayer and diet and I couldn’t agree more. Every morning on my way to work ( I am in a new job) I pray to stay‘in the Spirit’! God has changed me in SO many ways and I don’t for ONE second think He had nothing to do with this for He did! My purpose is to help others who–like me don’t think they can for they are hurting or injured or scared, for we WILL succeed!

Thank you Rhonda for including me, I feel truly blessed. Please read the other stories on here, they are truly amazing!!!!

 The WalkerLady, with a cane, in the library 
 Jul 4 

Good Morning dear friends,

 I know, I know, in the library! BUT I JUST adore Clue don’t you!! Couldnt’resist…. hope you enjoy my story below…. 

Now, we are back to talking about weight loss and eating healthy. Sure we are going to have some every day life thrown in now and again. This is what makes a blog, a REAL blog!

Since I stated out at 245, and started out  as ‘The Walker Lady’ I wanted to show you all how I got there and continue from there. 

So, we are going to go back to the Brickhouse Gym and talk about Beth again, she was the one who introduced me to the Eat Clean diet. Now, as I have mentioned there no longer is a Brickhouse gym and you need to go below to find Beth and do the‘Gauntlet.’Good luck if you do! LOL

 Metro Family Fitness 30 N. Groesbeck 

But back to my story.

I was doing my training with Beth in 2010 when my knee really started bothering me. That is me below after doing the’Gauntlet’–looks deceiving but I had just worked my tail off! I have moved the damn tire  more than once DAMN)

Pain–Gauntlet
 
More Sweat-Thank you Beth, Marissa and Ken! And I can’t thank the Brickhouse Crew, I love you all!
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, just to show you some pictures of where I was BEFORE I blew out my knee…I lost about 15  pounds and 13 inches I think before that happened! I LOVED it! Loved Circuit Training, I would highly recommend it to anyone.

When I  was in 8th grade, I hurt my knee in gym class, blew out my ACL and had surgery, woke up to a freaking clown, just sayin’–PLEASE don’t do this to your kids! It is not that they did anything wrong during my surgery, but they didn’t have the technology back then that they have now,  so it created an arthritic situation over the years which just gradually got worse with wear and tear.

After years of it hurting and avoiding–and yeah over doing it at the gym, I  had it looked it. When we saw the first surgeon , they scoped it. With me being so young–I was still in my 30′s, they didn’t want to do a Total Knee Replacement. THIS is not because of  the surgery, this is because of your SECOND AND THIRD surgeries. Most likely I will have two more in my lifetime, which will be A LOT more intense than what I have already been though which I must I admit, I can’t even imagine at this point.

So, they scoped, told me I was bone on bone and basically had cartilage issues–but didn’t really fix it because there wasn’t a point. It was also suggested I lose weight. I had already started this path, I was still in the 220′s.  I stated Eating Clean a few weeks later as I mentioned in an earlier post.

This stated a year of physical therapy, trying to get my knee better. He didn’t want to do the surgery, didn’t think I was there yet, I was too young etc. During this time I did injections, had shots, had a manipulation ( this is where they put you under and manually break up the scar tissue) this helps you for you don’t have your brain telling you it hurts.  After this procedure he went out and told my Michael how he was able to get me to bend so much and maybe I need to pain management, basically saying‘this was in my head’! I can’t tell you even to this day how PISSED I was! STILL am! After that day, I went to PT and said‘I don’t care how bad this hurts, you do WHATEVER you have to do, just do it’I was SO pissed! But still I didn’t get better!  In fact the injections made me worse, chicken fat is what they were and they even told me that hadn’t had someone react like me…

In 2011 we got a second opinion…

I told them out the manipulation and what had happened and they told me that he could have got me to bark like a dog and what happened was totally wrong. FINALLY someone was listening to me, someone was understanding the year of hell I had gone through.

They did suggest surgery, YES they said that I would have multiple surgeries, YES, the next one would BE HORRIBLE and I needed to think about  this, I would have rods and what not! BUT what I needed to think about was that if I let this go TOO long, it would go up into my thigh…

Let me say up front I am kinda a wimp! If you piss me off, I will do what I can but still…I don’t like pain, have issues with medications, and I can struggle! I wish I knew now what I didn’t know then. Just not sure I would have done this! I know I needed too, but man…

I had the surgery February 2011 and I am still struggling….

This is not the best picture and one of the only ones I have….

I was on my walker for almost a year,  I was determined NOT to gain all my weight back and continue on my path even if I couldn’t work out! I wasn’t sure HOW I was going to do it! It was sooo hard, still is!

I froze some of Beth’s Superman Muffins to have after my surgery so that Michael didn’t have to cook for me and I could have them when I got home. I did Cooler 1 ( often)! 

I started slow but I went for walks on my walker around my block and eventually went up to 2 miles on my walker, hence I became the Walker Lady….

The other day someone in my neighborhood mentioned how far I’ve come and it was cool! They watched me go from the walker, to the cane, to me now…

So, how am I now?

I still have frozen shoulder, the sharp pain still seems to have gone–though I admit I baby it, I don’t make sudden moves or anything so I am not totally sure. I don’t have the movement–I can’t raise my arms above my head or to the side. We THINK this has come from being on my walker so long.  I did have a tear on the left side, though my right side seems worse–still. We got some info back from U of M with a bunch of big words which I haven’t looked up yet–maybe when I have some time.

I still have chest pain, yeah we have no idea what that is, so who knows, I am living with it and I don’t even talk about it for what is the point! I just get use to not breathing at times…

My thigh, it bothers me every morning when I wake up. No idea, maybe from sleeping all night, who knows? I would like to get some weights, but need to research it. Yeah, when I have some time, would also like to do this for my arms, it was suggested by a friend in my Church group.

My knee, still having issues, especially on things like stairs, I can go down but not up. Have issues sometimes when I walk but not always, it seems to be’a sometimes’thing. I can only seem to do 2 miles, no more, but it’s not only the knee, it’s also the chest and thigh. And the weather seems to bother me too and it seems to‘hot’and I don’t know why? And sometimes it just hurts, and if I move it the wrong way, it just hurts. I don’t know, I limp though I try to hide that.

I am just trying to live with all this for it seems it will be my life and I don’t want to stop living! I have a job now and sometimes at work I have a hard time, I struggle but we need the help so–I have to put us first so! The rest, I just pray every morning! AND like I said, it’s not always! I just take it day by day!

Just as I have slipped a little on my weight loss, as I told someone today in response on my blog–we get comfortable and you know what, for someone like me, I can’t! I have to keep my balance–I haven’t been doing this that long, so now, I am just going to keep finding my way, and keep right on going so thank you‘timezonehoppers’for keeping me honest!

Happy 4th of July everyone!!!

 Webble Wobble and they CAN fall down… 
 Jun 23 

Hya,

I know, I know you think I have finally fallen off my walker! Well, not totally! I know I also said when I got back from Texas I would do this more often but I have had some things change recently.

I have a job!!! FULL TIME!! WHOOT! NOT sure I am ready for this?  EEK! Lots of phone-time, and crazy, crazy busy!!!!

Also, since I dropped out of Highschool–I taught myself to type. I know, you are asking WHY are you telling me this Traci? Well, since I am a scheduler at a Court Reporting firm, some of these lovely people type 120 WPM! UM HELLO? And, well as I said I taught myself so I don’t use the shift key for caps like most people, so am TRYING to learn this but it’s slowing me down and with my job–I have to know how to type, be REALLY anal and fast–two things I am NOT! Can I learn these things? For cutting and pasting aren’t options apparently. I would miss something yesterday in training and I was like UGH! But they keep telling me‘Traci, it’s your third day,  soon it’ll be why were you so worried?’It’s one data base and it’s the same thing ( yeah, there are variations) OVER AND OVER AND OVER all day long. Yeah, I worked at Dell and had three databases and did data entry and I am STILL freaking out! This too shall pass, I know!

I’ve been stressed! I haven’t walked ALL week and–ok here is where you say the TRUTH RIGHT? I am at 159.2 ! I haven’t been this since I starting losing weight! NOW, first off let me say it’s TRACI’S TIME! But still, RED FLAGS, no pun intended!  But still, this is a warning, a heads up, a get it together Traci! Now, I won’t totally freak out till next week when I can look at the scale and see where I really am. BUT still, OH MY GOD! And, I haven’t really eaten that much differently.  But, I really think walking, even with as slow as I do it–these two miles or so apparently are helping. I  am up at 6:40 every morning and getting home around 6pm and then having to make dinner and blah blah. I KNOW ya’ll do it too, but I am SO not use to this. I’m just going to have to make the time to go walk. I don’t want to get up early (lol) so I may ask my WONDERFUL husband if I can walk before dinner and eat a bit later so I can MAKE sure I go.

First off, I just ordered a Graduation picture of Courtney–will post it when I have it! I couldn’t take pictures inside really so we ordered one.

Two, we also had another Graduation, which was Breah’s, Michael’s daughter. As a lot of you know, this is a hard place for us. There is some pain with his daughters per our adoption. It comes down to how Britt found out. We didn’t tell her right, we couldn’t reach her, so she was very angry. She has made it quite clear that she will do what she can to make this not happen for us. She does not live with us, she is in College, but that does not seem to matter. Breah, his other daughter, moved out when I moved back to Texas–over 4 years ago because Michael and I were having problems and well, Cort was in Texas. Courtney had always wanted me to come back to Texas, as I have always wanted her to come here to Michigan.
 
Breah and Courtney–Wyoming- Happier Times
 
The problem is–I always thought Cort would be here in Michigan! But fighting her Dad was just not going to work, he didn’t want me to have her for his reasons and it just became a battle I was not going to put Cort through.  So, I was always in two places and it caused a lot of issues here, for I struggled. I had one foot in Michigan and one foot in Texas and really it was not fair to anyone. This got better once I moved back to Michigan and married Michael in 2009. I finally accepted that things were this way and Courtney was old enough and going to be ok. Though, as you read from my last post, I will always be a Mama Bear!

I finally made a promise to Cort that I would come to Texas–I couldn’t break it no matter HOW much Breah wanted me too. I loved both my girls, that was the problem, they both loved me.  Breah wanted me to stay, Cort wanted me to go. So, I left. Michael and I cried in our driveway, it was a very, very hard time.

I got to Texas, Cort was great–at first. The thing was, Cort wanted her freedom. Her Dad pretty much let her do what she wanted–then I come along–I am IN her life, IN her business-we fought ALL the time.

And Michael was so hurt, and it was bad in Michigan–the kids were upset! I was a mess!

I finally broke down and called Michael,  we had a huge fight–I guess that’s normal , we broke up. I was getting it from all sides, it was NOT a good place for me.

But we finally started talking, and discussing everything–Cort and I weren’t even speaking, I didn’t even see her on Christmas…

Three months later I was back in Michigan.

But I lost Breah, I lost Courtney, almost 4 years later I cry as I write this. MY heart still breaks! I recall Breah telling Courtney what a bitch I was AND Courtney agreeing with her! It was brutal!

But the tide shifted when Courtney came to Michigan with lice–I was SOOOO mad, I couldn’t BELIEVE  her Dad couldn’t see that! And I spent ALL my time getting it out of her hair, I ended up getting it. And Michael was great through this. He didn’t freak out or anything and Erik was ok.  And Breah was still here but at first she was pretty upset and she was bad mouthing me and Courtney said to her‘don’t you ever call my Mama a bitch’and things between them have never been the same. It’s just very sad.

So, Breah can’t forgive me, she can’t forgive Michael, and her and Courtney, well, they are very different and this just made the gap widen.

 Status as of today… 

Breah had a minor car accident, last year I think. She was fine! The thing was, we have this wall of pictures of all us through the years and I was just sitting there crying and praying to God! Saying‘please just open her heart’and 10 minutes later she calls…

She called Michael crying and told him she loved him and didn’t want things  left un-said and they talked.  So, we see her sometimes…but she is still not happy about us adopting I am not sure why? So it’s the white elephant in our relationship.  But  I THINK it’s either because she thinks she’ll be replaced or because Britt is against it. But she won’t talk about it. It seems she comes around when she wants something or when she can‘fit us in’! Don’t get me wrong, she is polite and all that but it’s just all surface. I have pushed for more through all this but I am just not sure I want to keep doing that anymore. I keep hoping she will have that‘breakthrough’but I am just not sure anymore if she will have that?

She told me she loves me a bit ago, it was in passing…and she is nice to me, but it’s all on the surface.

But she wants a superficial relationship, a figurehead! Which is hard for Michael.

Hence the student loans for college…Michael is old school. He DOES not like giving out what is in his back account ( I agree). He gave her everything but what IS in our back account, she WAS NOT happy! So, when he mentioned the adoption, she got upset again–of course not talking about it. So, again she is upset with us, since we are a pair.

So, we went to her Graduation. But per Father’s day, she called, for she had a concert that night ( umm hello, could have come by during the day or something but didn’t) , said she come by some day that week–never heard from her. Whatever, I am TRYING to let it go! I mean, jeez, even Courtney called Michael. It just drives me crazy!

So, this is what is going on in Traci’s life right now! I am trying to get a handle on things, figure out a schedule so I can navigate around a bit. Sorry I haven’t been commenting as much–will try to do more of that. Still reading!!  My aim right now is to try to do this at least twice a week for now. Right now as we speak, I am icing my knee so I can go walk, since I haven’t walked all week and it’s sore for God only  knows why but I can’t afford to make it worse–and I want to walk SO badly I am going to go anyway. LOL

Hope everyone is well!!!!! Miss you  all!

 Graduation and tears of a Mama Bear … 
 Jun 13 

Hello Dear friends!!

I am home!! Back from the Texas heat and home to the Michigan 70′s! I must admit–going from‘oh my God’soooooo HOTTTTTTTT to‘oh how pleasant outside’takes some getting use to! 

So, not only did my babykins graduate!!! I must admit, it was VERY hard on this Mama bear!  The toughest thing was watching her drive away–it broke my heart just a little. I KNOW, I know, we are to raise our kids and set them free–let them go off into the world, but still, it broke my heart just a little. For so long, I have loved and cried, held on, been there no matter WHAT, and I’m to just LET GO? Walk away? Let her make her own judgements, her own mistakes, her own, her own choices? Sigh, I know, I know, but still my heart broke a little…

I gave this to Courtney for Graduation as it was given to me by my Mama, I can’t read this without crying…

‘I love you Forever’

Written by Robert Munsch

‘That teenager grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was a grown-up man. He left home and got a house across town. But sometimes on dark nights the mother got into her car and drove across town.  If all the lights in her son’s house were out, she opened his bedroom window, crawled across the floor, and looked up over the side of his bed. If that great big man was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rocked him she sang:

I’ll love you forever,
I’ll like you for always,
As long as I’m living
my baby you’ll be.’
 
Cort and Mom-Riverwalk
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Courtney now has a job, drives a car and is looking to take classes this Fall.  I hope she understands a Mama Bear is for life! We love, we cherish, we keep our children next to our hearts always. Though, I am learning to back off ( I am TRYING)–to let her live HER life, make HER choices, not interfere and LISTEN! I am proud of the woman she is becoming, honored I get to share this next chapter in our lives! For Courtney Aline, is quite simply–amazing!

 Sudo Vegan World… 
 May 17 

Good Morning my dear friends!

I feel like the Tin man from Wizard of Oz, I just need a little oil and all my parts will be working again. It’s funny, my step son ( who is also a vegan, though MUCH further along then I.  We were talking the other day and it seems that though we both eat more healthy, we seem to the ones with the issues–go figure!)

One side note, then back to my story….

Per my EMG (nerve testing), I do not have nerve damage, my thigh’s atrophied, from‘lack of use’apparently. The reason this makes me SO angry is because I have asked for almost a year‘what is wrong, what can I do, what needs to be done?’And I have gotten‘we don’t know, you have a weak thigh’. From what one person told me recently,‘put some weights on it, all the cardio, leg lifts etc won’t help you if you don’t have weight’. UGH, really? I guess I keep thinking, had someone told me this a year ago, how many of my current medical issues RIGHT now could have been avoided? For now, it looks like I didn’t WANT to do anything or I WAS lazy or I WAS hurting too much when I WAS out walking two miles on a damn walker. OK vent over. So, now I am going to get some light weights, keep up my walking and try to get this pain in my damn thigh to stop and get my leg to stop looking like a squash. Also, this still doesn’t address my knee issues, my shoulder issues, my chest issues, BUT it’s a start and I am all for starts! I am just frustrated, but you know what? I lost over 90 pounds while being flat on my back, this isn’t going to stop me either! 

To bring this all together. As a lot of you know, I lost a lot of weight with the Eat Clean diet ( thank you Beth and  Marissa and Ken) I couldn’t have continued at the gym when I was laid off if Marissa Jarrett and her husband Ken had not let me stay there with a VERY discounted rate so I have to REALLY say thank you to them, REALLY say thank you to them!  These are amazing trainers so if you are looking for some, check them out!

You can find my story here at the Eat Clean Site…

 http://www.eatcleandiet.com/community/success_stories/traci_dean.aspx#responses 

Tosca has come out with a Vegetarian cook book and is having guest bloggers on her site tell their stories–mine will appear May 20th…thank you so much for having me Tosca, it’s truly an honor!!!

 http://toscareno.blogspot.com/ 

I  hope you will come check it out and read the other guest bloggers–there are so many interesting ones. Whether you are a vegan, vegetarian or just want to maybe try a meat-less meal every once in a while, swing by–it’s been a great read and trust me, my blog, will surprise you–it’s all I am sayin!! 

I also have a good eats for you, I have stolen this from my step son Erik and revised it, it’s so delish!
 
Mango Tosda
 
Recipe:

1 whole wheat tortilla

1-2 tablespoons clean humus of choice

1-2 tablespoons clean salsa-Whole foods has an amazing one ( careful, you don’t want to make it TOO wet)

1/4 mango

1/4 avocado

Cover tortilla with humus and place in toaster oven, on a higher temperature–you want it to‘bake’and be crispy. Remove and add salsa, slices of avocado and slices of mango.

I usually eat two of these ( small tortillas), and then you can have the remaining mango for dinner . Or have one as a snack.  For non-vegans/vegetarians, you can add meat to this or I have even made them with green onions, lettuce, black beans and tomatoes–there are a lot of avenues.

My step son originally used a flat bread and  spicy humus. Before he became a vegan, he loved Little Caesars’crazy bread and when the humus is baked it has a cheese like texture, but for me the tortilla is just lighter.

Hope you enjoy!  I will be in Texas for two weeks because my baby is graduating High School but after that, I will be around more!
 
Aye’she’s got me…
 
Take care and God Bless!

 Brief Intermission… 
 Apr 30 
 
Brief Intermission
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hi everyone!

Sorry, I haven’t  been around–I wanted to write a quick note to let you know a few things….

 I again have some medical issues–I just haven’t had the energy to do much blogging. I am working this out and it’s temporary so please be patient with me. 

 My daughter’s  graduating from Highshool and I’m scrapping a memory book for her. This is not something I‘m  familiar with, so it’s taking up some of my limited time as well. 

 I’m also  walking at least 2 miles every day! This wears me out, and bothers my chest and thigh, but I  really want to push through this. We are looking to do EMG testing on my thigh.  It’s been suggested I may have nerve damage, we shall see. 

 I still can’t seem to handle the computer more than a few hours at a time–so I need to  focus on things around my home and getting things done before I go to Texas at the end of May. I will try  to do another entry before then. Please know, I’m still here, just a tad behind. 

Xoxoxoxox,

Traci

 What Traci did today, I MUST love my husband! 
 Apr 1 

I must love my husband because as you are starting to understand about me, I have the heart of a vegan, just not the taste buds of one. One thing I am loving about this new lifestyle is my husband is on board!  HE”s actually doing much better than ME! I did wonderful per the Eat Clean lifestyle.  I was GREAT at doing that, but with only fruits and veggies–I‘m struggling at times.

So, when he comes to me and wants treats to take to work that aren’t full of sugar and chemicals, I’m SO on board and EVEN better, I DON’T eat them! Well, not most of them anyway! We seem to have become the muffin house as of late, so if anyone has any muffin recipes,  please pass them on.  The first one’s been a standard lately in our house and it’s in my recipes–the banana,walnut muffins but I added blueberries, so delish!
 
Banana, blueberry, walnut muffins
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blueberries are one of the ONLY fruits I will eat cooked, yes I KNOW I’m a vegan, lol!!  My husband wanted some apple muffins instead of some quick treat he could buy at the store.  I thought, ok, I can try…
 
Apple, cinnamon muffins
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michael said these muffins were good, but judging by the disaster my kitchen was, I felt I was off to a good start.

Now, here’s the last experiment, don’t you just LOVE having your own personal tester!!  These LOOKED good, even to ME! Kinda like a cinnamon roll sooooo I thought, these are SO Michael! THESE were the best he said.

And by the way, these are ALL vegan–well I made them vegan! 
 
Apple, brown sugar, walnut muffins
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This was how I spent my Sunday!  I am soooo tired I must say!  I AM  not a baker! But, I do feel better that he’s getting these from me and not buying  junk at the store.  Now, just to get Traci  more vegan friendly, I know, I know I’m getting there!!! 

Hope you’re enjoying Palm Sunday!

Thank you Tosca and Beth for showing me how to Eat Clean, you both saved my life! Now, I get to pay it forward!
I am a strong believer in Christ and the power of prayer--my faith has gotten me through many dark nights!

God Bless,
Traci
