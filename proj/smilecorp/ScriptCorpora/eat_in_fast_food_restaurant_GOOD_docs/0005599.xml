 1-Ply 17&quot;x9&quot; Roll Dispenser Napkin 6000/CS $57.99/CS 
 

 
 
 Details 
 
This roll napkin dispenser is great for use 
with the napkin roll we carry as item# 
3524351. This dispenser works great for 
sitting on countertops in restaurants and 
cafeterias. It is easy to use; just pull down 
on the napkin roll paper that is easily 
inserted in the dispenser and tear out as 
much as you need. It is a great way to help 
eliminate the overabundant use of 
napkins, 
because customers can tear off just the 
right amount instead of grabbing a stack of 
napkins.

These roll napkin dispensers are super convenient for our fast food restaurant. The client just tears them off the roll,and they don&apos;t spill all over the floor like the other ones.
