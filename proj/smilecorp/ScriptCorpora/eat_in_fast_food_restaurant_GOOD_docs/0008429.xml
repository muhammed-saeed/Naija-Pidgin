Bay County Jail, Panama City, Florida 
 February 24, 2005 News Herald 
Bay County Jail officials ordered last weekend the
installation of exterior, sliding-bolt locks on transport van doors to prevent
escape attempts by inmates, said the jails warden. The new locks come after an inmate broke out of a Corrections Corporation
of America transport van Friday afternoon, resulting in an 18-hour manhunt. On Friday, 18-year-old Jeremy D. Aultman of Panama City Beach
manipulated the CCA vans door-locking mechanism through the interior
paneling, CCA officials said. Aultman then escaped from the van that was
transporting 13 inmates to the Bay County Jail Annex, CCA officials said.    Along with new locks, maintenance crews placed a
steel plate over the interior passenger-door panels of the transport van that
Aultman escaped from, Watson said. Watson said steel plates already were in place on other CCA vans. Watson on Tuesday defended the actions of his transport driver,
who prisoners said failed to notice Aultman trying to escape and then ran from
the vehicle to catch Aultman, according to police reports. Watson said Tyndal followed CCA policies and has not been disciplined. Tyndal climbed out of the van to chase Aultman but gave up and
returned to the van, according to the reports. Though none of the 12 remaining inmates joined
Aultman in trying to flee, some reported to police that they had ample
opportunity. Inmate
Ryan Meadows and Stanford W. Ferguson sat behind Aultman during the transport
from the main jail to Bayou George, according to CCA incident reports.&quot;Tyndal
jumped out of the van, leaving his door and our door wide open keys still in
the van,&quot;Meadows stated in the incident report. Ferguson concurred Meadows report that Tyndal chased Aultman without
securing the vans doors. Meadows
added that when Tyndal came back to the van, the guard took the inmates on a&quot;high-speed&quot;chase through the nearby residential area called The
Cove. Fridays escape attempt occurred about five months after four inmates at
the main jail escaped from their cells and held CCA employees hostage. A faulty
cell door lock received part of the blame for allowing the uprising, according
to a state investigation. 

 February 20, 2005 News Herald 
Police captured and returned to jail a Panama City Beach man on Saturday, a day
after he escaped from a transport van. Panama City police found Jeremy D.
Aultman, 18, at about 7 a.m., walking through a residential area about a block
from where he escaped, according to police reports. Aultman became the
subject of a manhunt Friday afternoon when he unlocked the transport vans
door from the inside and ran from the vehicle as it waited on a traffic signal.
Thore said Aultman was en route to the Bay County Jail Annex in Bayou George
with 12 other inmates when he escaped. Thore said Correction Corporation of
America , the Tennessee company that manages the jail for Bay County , continues
to investigate the incident. 

 Bracken County Jail , Bracken County, Kentucky 
 October 12, 2005 Maysville Ledger
Independent 
With a $94,000 good news report, Augusta-Brooksville-Bracken County Industrial
Authority Chairman Tom Stephenson appeared before Bracken County Fiscal Court
Wednesday. Change is what Jailer Gary Riggs wanted when a bill for was taken out
of his budget for costs to retrieve two prisoners from Louisiana.&quot;I have
no say over what the sheriff&apos;s office does, yet they take the funds out of my
budget,&quot;said Riggs. In July, Anthony Silvey and Ashley Luman were caught
by Louisiana authorities after an auto theft arrest in Bracken County. The pair
allegedly served some jail time in Louisiana and were returned to Kentucky at
the request of Bracken County Sheriff Mike Nelson who used the services of
Transcor to bring them back. Following what Riggs and magistrates felt was a
costly trip, the criminal charges against the pair were reduced and time served,
including in Louisiana, was assessed, plus probation and court costs.&quot;They
got a free ride home is what it amounts to, though Luman is facing charges in
Mason County,&quot;said Riggs. Magistrates agreed to pay the bill the county
received for $843.21 from Transcor and look into the retrieval cost situation. 

 Bradford County Jail , Starke, Florida 
 February 4, 2008 Jacksonville Times-Union
 A privately contracted corrections officer is in jail after Bradford County 
deputies charged him Friday with having sex with two inmates he was 
transporting. Shaun McFadden, 26, was arrested at the Days Inn in Starke after 
one of the women escaped from a motel room where she&apos;d been taken and called 
police, Bradford County Sheriff Bob Milner said. Both women went to the motel 
willingly, but one became fearful and fled, Milner said. McFadden is charged 
with two counts of having sex with an inmate in custody. He is being held on 
$100,000 bail. Police didn&apos;t disclose the women&apos;s names. The incident began 
after McFadden, an armed officer who works for the national corrections 
transport chain Transcor, took four prisoners to the Bradford County jail. 
Milner said such prisoners come from different locations and spend time in the 
jail until being transported to their final destination. The jail is paid a fee 
to house the prisoners. McFadden returned a short time later and told 
authorities he needed to take the two women to a local hospital for physicals so 
they could be cleared for further transport. McFadden and the women, who were 
handcuffed and shackled, then left. A police report said the women and McFadden 
had planned the move. The women told police they intended to drink and smoke 
with McFadden, while one also planned to escape. The women told police McFadden 
had consensual sex with them at the motel on U.S. 301. One of the women said she 
became fearful that McFadden might harm her and fled while he was in the shower. 
When police arrived, they found McFadden and the other woman still in the room. 
The women were neither restrained nor injured when police found them. One was to 
be taken to Brevard County, while the other was headed for Atlanta. Milner 
didn&apos;t know what the women were being held for, but they weren&apos;t charged in the 
Bradford incident. 

 Brighton Jail , Brighton, Colorado 
 Police are searching for a man they say was being held on burglary charges who escaped from a transport van in Brighton late Wednesday night. They say Floyd W. Stolin Jr., 31, jumped out of a van at about 10:22 p.m. as the van stoppped on the off-ramp of Interstate 76 and Bromley Lane. The van, operated by private prisoner transport service TransCor America, was bringing Stolin to the Brighton jail. (Denver Post, August 5, 2004) 
 Colorado 
 The American Civil Liberties Union disclosed Tuesday that it has obtained &quot;a substantial settlement&quot; for a female prisoner who said she was sexually assaulted by a guard while being transported between jails in Texas and Colorado. The settlement ends a 3-year-old lawsuit filed against TransCor America, a Tennessee-based private extradition company, now owned by Corrections Corporation of America. The amount was not disclosed. &quot;No woman should ever have to endure what our client went through,&quot; said Cynthia Kok, a co-counsel in the case. &quot;And no amount of money can make up for it.&quot; The lawsuit alleges that in March 1998 she was assaulted while in shackles while being returned to Fremont County to face a theft charge. Kok said she knows of four other lawsuits against TransCor, stemming from similar incidents, including two lawsuits in Colorado, one in Texas and one in Virginia. In March, lawyers for TransCor admitted to the court that they had learned of five other cases of sexual misconduct by transport guards working for the company. (Rocky Mountain

 Crossroads Correctional Facility , Shelby, Montana 
 February 15, 2006 KXLF
 A private inmate transport van hit black ice and crashed on Homestake Pass 
near Butte last night. No serious injuries were reported, but the eight 
prisoners were taken to St. James Healthcare for examination. Montana State 
Prison Warden Mike Mahoney said the inmates were not in the custody of the state 
Corrections Department. The inmates were being transported by TransCor America. 
Mahoney said the van was headed to Deer Lodge, where the inmates were to spend 
the night -- some at the Powell County jail and some at the state prison intake 
unit. Mahoney believes the inmates were being taken to Washington or Oregon. 

 January 20, 2006 AP and Great Falls Tribune 
Putting the Department of Corrections in charge of transporting almost all 
prisoners in the state drew mixed reaction from lawmakers Thursday. DOC Director 
Bill Slaughter and other officials have been weighing the idea for some time, 
but raised it again following last week&apos;s escape of accused murderer Dueston 
Haggard near Helena. Currently, DOC transports about 47 percent of prison 
inmates, with the U.S. Marshals Service, local law enforcement and private 
contractors comprising the rest, department spokesman Bob Anez told the Law and 
Justice Interim Committee. The department is considering taking over transports 
for the Marshals Service and bearing more of the load for local law enforcement, 
he said. DOC is already assuming control of services from private contractor 
TransCor America when its contract with the state expires on June 30. 

 January 19, 2006 Helena Independent Record 
Escape charges wont be resubmitted against two men who broke out of a prison 
transport van in Helena in 2004 because that might constitute double jeopardy. 
Deputy Lewis and Clark County Attorney Carolyn Clemens said on Wednesday that 
given past U.S. Supreme Court rulings regarding double jeopardy being tried 
twice for the same crime she believes any effort by her to refile the cases 
against Brian Holliday and William Brown would be barred. Clemens said she was 
disappointed by Helena District Court Judge Thomas Honzels decision to dismiss 
the charges last week on the wording of jury instructions. But she added that 
tacking more time onto the escapees existing life sentences was never her goal. 
Trying them for escape in the first place was not to give them more time, as 
they are lifers anyway, but rather to let them and others know that we wouldnt 
just turn a deaf ear on escapes in Helena, she said. Holliday, Brown, Russell 
VanKirk and Jasper Phillips were charged with escape after they removed a screen 
from the back window of a private TransCor van and jumped out as the vehicle was 
parked outside Burger King on 11th Avenue while one of the guards made a dinner 
run. The defense attorneys asserted that the specific wording of instructions 
offered to the jury at trial not challenged by prosecutors indicated, in 
their opinion that their clients couldnt have escaped because they werent in 
the custody of peace officers. A response brief filed by Deputy County Attorney 
Lisa Leckie stated that the legal definition requires the placement of a person 
in the legal custody of a governmental body as the result of the constraint or 
in custody of the person in one of three ways by a peace officer pursuant to 
arrest, by transport, or by legal order. 

 January 13, 2006 Helena Independent Record
 As law enforcement officers searched for an escaped murder suspect in Helena 
Wednesday, a district court judge ruled that two men who bailed out of a 
transport van at Burger King on 11th two years ago should have a new trial in 
that case. Judge Thomas Honzel stated in his decision that prosecutors failed to 
prove that Brian Holliday and William Brown were in the custody of peace 
officers when they climbed out of a back window in the TransCor America van in 
which they were riding en route to Montana State Prison in September 2004. Lewis 
and Clark County Attorney Leo Gallagher said Thursday that he was disappointed 
by the decision, but it didnt come as much of a surprise given the judges 
response to prosecutors arguments in the case at a hearing on the issue held 
earlier this week.The defense attorneys asserted that the specific wording of 
instructions offered to the jury at trial not challenged by prosecutors 
indicated, in their opinion, that their clients couldnt have escaped because 
they werent in the custody of peace officers. TransCor is a private company 
that was contracted to transport the prisoners. 

 January 10, 2006 Helena Independent Record
 District Court Judge Thomas Honzel didn&apos;t make a decision at a hearing 
Monday regarding a new trial for two convicts who bailed out of a prison 
transport van outside a Helena Burger King in 2004, but he certainly appeared to 
be looking closely at the defense&apos;s arguments. Honzel called Deputy County 
Attorney Lisa Leckie to a blackboard in the courtroom to explain her belief that 
instructions given to the jury in the case of Brian Holliday and William Brown 
would allow for the possibility that the men could be found guilty - on a 
grammatical, and as a result, a legal level. In addition, he quizzed Leckie 
intensely about why she didn&apos;t specify a certain sub-section of the law naming 
transport personnel in those jury instructions, thus eliminating the basis for 
defense tactics being pursued by public defenders Jeremy Gersovitz and Randi 
Hood that their clients weren&apos;t in legal custody at the time of their escape. 
Holliday, Brown, Russell VanKirk and Jasper Phillips were charged with escape 
after they removed a screen from the back window of a transport van operated by 
TransCor America as the vehicle was parked outside Burger King on 11th Avenue in 
September 2004. Shortly after the men&apos;s conviction, Gersovitz and Hood 
challenged that verdict on the basis that the specific wording of jury 
instructions - not challenged at trial by prosecutors - indicated, in their 
opinion, that the men could not have escaped because they weren&apos;t in the custody 
of peace officers. A brief filed by Leckie at that time stated that the legal 
definition requires the placement of a person in the legal custody of a 
governmental body as the result of the constraint or custody of the person in 
one of three ways - by a peace officer pursuant to arrest, by transport or by 
legal order. 

 December 30, 2005 Billings Gazette 
The last two of four prisoners who broke out of a prison transport van
 at a fast-food restaurant here last year have been sentenced to more
 prison time for the escape. District Court Judge Thomas Honzel tacked 10
 years onto the end of Russell R. VanKirk&apos;s murder sentence and added 20
 years to William L. Brown&apos;s earlier murder sentence. The two others
 involved in the escape, Jasper Phillips and Brian Holliday, were
 sentenced earlier. In September 2004, the four broke a screen of the
 private prison transport van when it stopped at a Burger King. The
 prisoners were en route to Montana State Prison when the guards stopped
 to buy dinner for the men. Phillips was caught by one of the guards
 before he could make it out of the parking lot. The other three were
 caught within hours. 

 December 14, 2005 Independent Record 
Last week, a Helena District Court judge tacked 10 years onto the 90-year
sentence already being served by a convicted murderer who escaped from a prison
transport van parked outside of a Helena Burger King in 2004. Judge Thomas
Honzel sentenced Brian Holliday to 10 years for the escape, six months in jail
for attempted theft, and another 10 years for being a persistent offender. The
sentences are to run concurrently to each other, and consecutive to his sentence
for murder. Two of Holliday&apos;s fellow escapees - William Brown and Russell
VanKirk - are scheduled to be sentenced for their involvement later this month.
The fourth member of the group, Jasper Phillips, pleaded guilty to the escape
charge shortly after the incident and received a five-year sentence to be served
consecutively to the sentence he was already serving at Montana State Prison.
Holliday, Brown, VanKirk and Phillips were charged with escape after they
removed a screen from the back window of a transport van operated by TransCor
America as the vehicle was parked outside Burger King on 11th Avenue in
September 2004. At trial, defense attorneys unsuccessfully argued that their
defendants couldn&apos;t legally be convicted of escape because they weren&apos;t in
official detention as defined by Montana law at the time they bailed out of the
transport van. Despite the jury&apos;s unwillingness to accept that argument, the
defense attorneys filed documents with the court last month requesting a new
trial for their clients on the basis that the TransCor guards aren&apos;t peace
officers as described in Montana code. Prosecutors discount that argument, and
the judge has not yet made a ruling in the case. 

 December 8, 2005 Independent Record 
Lewis and Clark County prosecutors discount a recent argument by public
defenders that two men who bailed out of a prison transport van outside a Helena
Burger King last year should receive a new trial based on a legal technicality.
Deputy County Attorney Lisa Leckie argued in a brief filed in Helena District
Court Tuesday that a Powell County jury that found William Brown and Brian
Holliday guilty of escape in October did not err in its decision, and the guilty
verdict should stand.&quot;It&apos;s a matter of grammar,&quot;said Leckie
Wednesday, explaining that she disagrees with the interpretation outlined in a
recent brief by public defenders Randi Hood and Jeremy Gersovitz of what
conditions constitute&quot;legal detention.&quot;Hood and Gersovitz asserted
in a document filed shortly after the completion of the trial that Brown and
Holliday could not have escaped from the transport van because they weren&apos;t in
official detention by Montana&apos;s legal definition. Holliday, Brown, Russell
VanKirk and Jasper Phillips were charged with escape after they removed a screen
from the back window of a transport van operated by TransCor America as the
vehicle was parked outside Burger King on 11th Avenue in September 2004. In
opposition to the defense&apos;s argument that the prosecution failed to prove at
trial that TransCor employees were&quot;peace officers&quot;as required by the
legal definition of&quot;official detention&quot;that was included in the jury
instructions, Leckie asserted that the criteria for detention is actually more
broad. Leckie&apos;s brief states that the definition requires the placement of a
person in the legal custody of a governmental body as the result of the
constraint or custody of the person in one of three ways - by a peace officer
pursuant to arrest, by transport or by court order. For that reason, she denies
that the defense has legal grounds to be granted a new trial by the judge in the
case. 

 December 2, 2005 Billings Gazette 
The lawyers for two men who bailed out of a prison transport van outside a
Helena Burger King, sparking a manhunt in a neighborhood last year, are asking
the trial judge to set aside a guilty verdict recently handed down by a jury in
the case. Public defenders Randi Hood and Jeremy Gersovitz filed the motion this
week, arguing that prosecutors failed to present evidence at a trial last month
that would prove that employees for TransCor America fit the legal definition of
peace officers. The attorneys contend that their clients, William Brown and
Brian Holliday, couldn&apos;t have escaped from the transport van, considering they
weren&apos;t in official detention by Montana&apos;s legal definition. It took jurors in
Powell County 30 minutes after a two-day trial in Deer Lodge in October to
convict Holliday of escape and attempted theft and Brown of escape. Jasper
Phillips pleaded guilty to his involvement shortly after the incident and
received a five-year sentence to be served consecutively to the sentence he was
already serving in Montana State Prison. Russell VanKirk also pleaded guilty and
is awaiting sentencing. VanKirk, Brown and Phillips were charged with escape
after they peeled a screen off a back window of a transport van as the vehicle
was parked outside Burger King on 11th Avenue in September 2004. Holliday was
charged with escape as well, but prosecutors tacked on a charge of attempted
theft because he rushed up to a couple sitting in a pickup truck and attempted
to hijack their vehicle. On the day of the escape, one of the transport van
guards immediately apprehended Phillips in the parking lot at Burger King, and
Holliday was arrested in the area soon later. VanKirk and Brown eluded police
for a longer period. However, they were both arrested within hours of the
escape. Deputy County Attorney Carolyn Clemens said Thursday that she was in the
process of reviewing the motion and will file a written response with the court. 

 November 4, 2005 Independent Record
 Two of four inmates who escaped from a prison transport van in Helena last
year were found guilty in connection with the incident by a Powell County jury
this week. It took jurors 30 minutes following a two-day trial in Deer Lodge to
convict Brian Holliday of escape and attempted theft, and William Brown of
escape. Jasper Phillips pleaded guilty to his involvement shortly after the
incident and received a five-year sentence to be served consecutively to the
sentence he was already serving in Montana State Prison. Russell VanKirk - who
is serving a life sentence for the 1995 murder of Helena resident Tamara Pengra
- waited until last week to enter his guilty plea. On the day of the escape, one
of the transport van guards immediately apprehended Phillips in the parking lot
at Burger King, and Holliday was arrested in the area soon later. VanKirk and
Brown eluded police for a longer period of time. However, they were both
apprehended within hours of the escape. Public defenders for the men argued at
trial that their clients could not possibly have escaped given that they weren&apos;t
in&quot;official detention&quot;at the time of the incident. Attorneys
asserted that the guards who manned the transport van owned by a private company
- TransCor - didn&apos;t meet the legal definition of peace officers as is written in
the law. Following the escape, officials with the Montana Department of
Corrections reviewed the state&apos;s contract with the company, and agreed to keep
it as long as several policy changes were made. Among those changes was a rule
that prisoner transports stop only at secure facilities, and local authorities
be notified of gas stops. Sack lunches will be used. In addition, a chase car
will follow vanloads of the most dangerous convicts, prisoner data sheets and
photos will be carried in the vans, and the DOC will be e-mailed about such
transfers.

 Three maximum-security inmates
pleaded not guilty Monday to escaping from a prison transport van in a
restaurant parking lot in September. A fourth inmate plans to enter the same
plea next month, prosecutors said. The inmates, several of them convicted
murderers, were among six being transported from the Crossroads Correctional
Center in Shelby to the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge on Sept. 2 when the
TransCor America van stopped at a Helena restaurant for food. Four men broke out
of the van through a window and two were nabbed quickly. The other two were
subjects of an intense manhunt for hours before being arrested in a nearby
residential neighborhood. The state immediately suspended
its $311,000 annual contract with TransCor following the escape and demanded
tighter security measures for movement of inmates. The company complied and has
since resumed work. TransCor was also asked to pay $23,516 to cover the state
and local government costs of recapture. Officials have refused to say how the
inmates were able to unlock their hand-cuffs and leg shackles without a key. 

 September 22, 2004 Billings Gazette 
 The company responsible for four maximum-security inmates
who escaped in Helena earlier this month will be asked to pay $23,516 to cover
the state and local government costs of recapturing them. In a letter to
TransCor America this week, the state Department of Corrections submitted a bill
for $21,708. That was the expense incurred by the Helena Police Department,
Lewis and Clark County sheriff&apos;s office, Montana Highway Patrol, the state
Criminal Investigation Bureau, Lewis and Clark County Search and Rescue, and the
American Red Cross. Joe Williams, head of the centralized services for the
department, said Wednesday his agency will send a separate bill for $1,808 to
the Nashville-based company. The four inmates, three of them convicted
murderers, were among six being transported from the Crossroads Correctional
Center in Shelby to the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge when the TransCor van
stopped at a Helena restaurant for food. Four men broke out of the van and two
were nabbed quickly. The other two were captured within the next eight hours
after an intensive manhunt in a residential neighborhood. Officials have refused
to say how the inmates were able to unlock their handcuffs and leg shackles
without a key. 

 September 14, 2004 Helena Independent Record 
 The company in charge of a transport
van overwhelmed by convicts Sept. 2 will be back hauling prisoners today. Montana
Department of Corrections Director Bill Slaughter said TransCor agreed to make
changes. The company, a subsidiary of Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of
America, also agreed to pick up the tab for the search, which is estimated to be
at least $20,000.The convicts used some sort of tool to free themselves of
handcuffs, leg irons and waist restraints. They were being transported from the
CCA-run Crossroad Correctional Facility in Shelby to the maximum security
Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, after their behaviour deteriorated and
officers found weapons and tools in their cells. 

 September 10, 2004 Helena Independent Record 
 Deep vibrations in the night awakened me. For a
moment, looking out the window was like watching some cop show on TV, where the
choppers pin the inner-city bad guys in blinding pillars of light as
loudspeakers tell them to throw down your weapons. The massive helicopter
and the searchlight sweeping the homes of sleeping residents fit the script
exactly except for one thingthis was Helena, not L.A. As it turned out, a lot
more than the choppers and searchlights fit the script for a Hollywood cop show.
Four convicts, who were being transported between Montana prisons, had just
broken out of a van while its driver ducked into Burger King for some fast food.
One, a convicted killer, was now loose within blocks of the home of his former
victims familyhence the choppers and searchlights in a city where sleep is
rarely disturbed by such events. But to make a short story long, the questions
are now pouring forth about how it was possible for four men, supposedly all
chained at ankle, wrist and waist, to break out of an armored prison van and
flee into the night. But at least part of the answer started a decade ago, when
then-Gov. Marc Racicot tossed hundreds of millions of tax dollars into an
ambitious spending plan that included, for the first time in Montanas
history, private prisons. It would also be great if such a move had actually
made Montanas state government more efficient and more effective, as
Racicot promised. Neither thing happened, however, as last weekends episode
illustrates. The privatization was just the latest domino to tumble in the
national Republican plan to turn the lucrative business of government over to
the private sector. Prisonsyeah, give em to contractors. Last
weekends incident in Helena, without question, is a direct outgrowth, since,
as it turns out, TransCor America, a division of Corrections Corporation of
America, was recently contracted by the state to transport prisoners. As it
turns out, some of the people who were around the Capitol when Racicot rammed
through privatization are still around. Jim Smith, for one, was and is the
lobbyist for the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. He is
also the current mayor of Helena. According
to Smith, prisoner transportation duties had been previously undertaken by the
counties. Smith says: We felt like we were performing a good service and
saving the state money. The problem, it seems, was with legislative
approval for the funds to reimburse counties for their expenses. After
successive legislatures refused to make the appropriation, Smith says the
counties gave notice in February that we were going to have to discontinue
prisoner transportation. Then came a miracle of modern politics. Although
no money existed to reimburse county governments for their expenditures,
suddenly money was found to contract with a private company. The
privatization of prisons and prison services in Montana deserves a second hard
look. One early promise, that Montana would not serve as a dumping ground for
out-of-state prisoners, has already gone by the wayside. Now, dangerous
prisoners roam residential neighborhoods at night, having walked away from a
supposedly armored prison transport van. 

 September 10, 2004 Billings Gazette 
On the day that four inmates escaped from a prison transport van parked at a
city Burger King, the transport service&apos;s parent company received an award as&quot;outstanding business of the year&quot;from Gov. Judy Martz. Corrections
Corp. of America, the firm that runs Montana&apos;s private prison in Shelby, owns
TransCor and had received the Desiree Taggart Memorial Award on Sept. 2, hours
before four maximum security prisoners escaped custody of TransCor workers while
en route from Shelby to Deer Lodge.&quot;It&apos;s unfortunate that the escape by
four prisoners occurred in Helena on the same day that CCA was being given this
award,&quot;said Chuck Butler, Martz&apos;s spokesman.&quot;It is one of those
unfortunate coincidences. Certainly, CCA had earned the award.&quot;The award
was presented to company officials about a mile from the fast-food restaurant
where the inmates made their escape. 

 September 9, 2004 Montana Standard 
The days of Burger King dinners may soon be over for
Montana prisoners and the private agents who transport them. State corrections
officials handed a list of demands on Wednesday to leaders of TransCor, the
private prisoner transport service from which four inmates escaped last
Thursday, among them: No more eating out. The
transport van was stopped at a mid-town Helena Burger King for dinner and a
trainee of the company was left in charge of six maximum security inmates while
her colleague a fully-trained officer went inside the restaurant. 

 September 9, 2004 Helena Independent Record 
 TransCor, the private prisoner transport service from
whose custody four inmates escaped here last week, offered a job to Corrections
Director Bill Slaughter several months before the state inked a deal with the
Tennessee-based company, records show. Slaughter
told legislative auditors in the spring that TransCor approached him to take a
job, a memo from the Legislative Audit Division shows. Slaughter told the
company he had no current plans to resign. Auditors, who were asked to
investigate the contract, concluded that Slaughter had broken no laws. The memo
was written on April 12, just days before TransCor&apos;s contract to transport
prisoners in Montana went into effect. 

 September 5, 2004 Helena Independent Record
 Anyone living in Helena&apos;s Central neighborhood where
two escaped murders were hiding late Thursday night has to be thankful that
local law enforcement officers were so quick to react and so thorough in their
search. A situation with all the ingredients of a disaster was defused after an
anxious night of roadblocks and intensive neighborhood searches on the ground
and from the air. Either of the two convicts was capable of committing further
hideous crimes, including murder, taking hostages or taking on police in a
standoff. Once mobilized, law enforcement officials
responded immediately and deserve everyone&apos;s sincere thanks for an excellent job
of keeping the escapees in a controlled area. But those minutes and decisions
made just before the escape cause us to ask several questions. Most of them have
to be directed to officials at the Montana Department of Corrections, which only
recently changed its method of transferring prisoners. Earlier this summer it
awarded the job to TransCor of America, a division of Corrections Corporation of
America. The firm also runs the state&apos;s only private prison in Shelby.
The
six maximum security inmates (two prisoners never left the van) were being
transported from Shelby to Deer Lodge, a routine transfer, according to
Department of Corrections Director Bill Slaughter. If the transfer was routine,
we have to wonder if it also is a matter of routine for guards escorting
prisoners to stop at a fast food restaurant in the middle of town for a quick
burger? It&apos;s a long trip from Shelby to Deer Lodge, but couldn&apos;t they pack a
lunch? At least, couldn&apos;t they have used the drive-through? We have to wonder if
two guards are enough to handle six maximum security inmates? Especially when
one of the guards leaves the van and goes into a restaurant? We have to wonder
if the van, which apparently was peeled open with the inmates&apos; bare hands, was
sufficiently armored to transport such deadly cargo? We have to wonder if a
transport van should even be allowed to stop in an area so familiar to a
convict, in this case VanKirk? And one especially disturbing question came from
members of the Pengra family, who wondered why they weren&apos;t notified of the
escape?

Thursday&apos;s escape attempt wasn&apos;t the first for convicted murderers Russell VanKirk and William Brown.
In fact, both of the men attempted on separate occasions to break out of the private prison in Shelby earlier this year, according to
officials with the Montana Department of Corrections. While Public Information Specialist Sally Hilander could not provide details about the efforts of the men to obtain their freedom, she said VanKirk was written up for an escape attempt on June 1 this year, while Brown was written up for similar activity on May 27. Before that, VanKirk attempted to break out of a Corrections Corporation of America facility in Tennessee in January 1998. At that time, Montana prisoners were being held there due to overcrowding in Deer Lodge. Brown tried to make a break from the Anaconda-Deer Lodge Jail following his arrest for deliberate homicide in May 2001. Brown was charged and convicted of that first escape attempt, but not the most recent effort. VanKirk was not formally charged with either of his previous escape attempts. Hilander said both of the men were being moved to Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge Thursday night because they had been reclassified as maximum security prisoners due to disruptive conduct at the private prison in Shelby. The Shelby facility doesn&apos;t have the proper accommodations for prisoners with that inmate status.

September 4, 2004 Billing Gazette 
Two private inmate transport agents and their Tennessee employer have been temporarily suspended from moving Montana prisoners as officials investigate the Thursday escape of two convicted murderers from a transport van stopped here at a Burger King. In all, four inmates escaped from the van , operated by TransCor, a subsidiary of Corrections Corporation of America, the nation&apos;s largest private corrections company. The breakout occurred Thursday evening as the van was idling in a Burger King parking lot near the Capitol for a dinner break. Two convicts were caught shortly after the escape. Two others, killers Russell VanKirk and Leonard Brown, remained on the lam for hours prompting a manhunt that lasted until after 1 a.m. Corrections Director Bill Slaughter said he temporarily suspended TransCor&apos;s 4-month-old contract as his agency and others try to answer some questions including: How did the inmates slip out of their shackles and handcuffs before the breakout? How did the prisoners rip the wire mesh covering the back windows of the van? Where was the guard who was supposed to be watching the van as her partner went into Burger King? Why didn&apos;t agents use the drive through? &quot;I don&apos;t know that I&apos;ve ever seen a more potentially dangerous situation,&quot; Slaughter said. &quot;We took this deadly serious.&quot; The escapees were among six inmates being transferred to the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge from the Crossroads Correctional Facility in Shelby because they had recently been reclassified as &quot;maximum security,&quot; said Mike Mahoney, warden of the Montana State Prison. The Shelby prison, run by
CCA, the parent corporation of TransCor, has no maximum security wing, Mahoney said. The only such wing is the one at Montana State Prison. Mahoney said he wasn&apos;t exactly sure why the men were reclassified to maximum security, but said they may have been too poorly behaved to safely stay in Shelby. The six inmates were traveling in a 12-passenger van, said Ashley Nimmo, director of marketing and communications for
TransCor. One of the agents had worked with the company since April when TransCor inked its contract with the state. The other was recently hired and was still receiving on the job training after her graduation from the company&apos;s two-week training program in July. The trainee was left in charge of the inmates as the fully trained officer went into the Burger King restaurant, Nimmo said, adding that such a situation does not violate TransCor safety policies.

Two convicted murderers escaped from a prison transport van while it was parked a fast-food restaurant, but they didn&apos;t get very far. Five hours after breaking the windows of the van to escape while one of the guards went into Burger King on Thursday, Russell Rex VanKirk was arrested just blocks away, said Helena Police Chief Troy McGee. William Leonard Brown was captured early Friday sneaking through yards nearby, he said. VanKirk was taken to the hospital to be treated for cuts. &quot;He&apos;s being well guarded,&quot; McGee said. They were among four men who escaped from the van at 6 p.m. The other two escapees were immediately captured. (AP)

Two convicted murderers escaped from a prison transport van Thursday evening at a fast-food restaurant here, Lewis and Clark County officials said. Russell Rex VanKirk and William Leonard Brown were among four men who broke a window out of the van at 6 p.m. VanKirk, Brown and two others escaped the van after one of the two guards had gone into Burger King. One inmate was badly cut by the glass and was treated at St. Peter&apos;s Community Hospital. Another was quickly apprehended and two remained in the van, McGee said.  Gov. Judy Martz was trying to acquire helicopters and night vision equipment to aid the search, Slaughter said. The men were being taken from the private Crossroads Corrections Center in Shelby to the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge by
TransCor, a company recently contracted by the state to transport inmates. (AP) 

 Houston , Texas 
 A former driver for a company transporting Harris County Jail inmates was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $5,000 Friday for sexually assaulting a female inmate he transported two years ago. The assault allegedly occurred while Edwards and another driver, David Jackson, were picking up and dropping off inmates at other jails around the state. Edwards and Jackson were employees of TransCor America, a Nashville, Tenn.-based company hired by the Harris County Sheriff&apos;s Department to bring inmates to Houston from other counties. During the sentencing phase, a Rhode Island woman testified that Edwards had sexually assaulted her in a TransCor van during a trip from Denver to New Mexico in September 1999.

 Kansas 
 On
 February 26, Rick Hollon sat chained inside a mesh cage in the back of a
 van rolling along the snow-dusted roads of Nevada. Clad in an orange
 jumpsuit, his hands shackled to his waist, Hollon had spent the previous
 two weeks traversing the country in similar cells-on-wheels. A beefy
 ex-Army helicopter crewman, Hollon had lost 30 pounds since his
 cross-country trip began. Outside, the temperatures were below freezing;
 his cage had become an icebox. Now I know why people run, he thought. A few weeks earlier, Hollon had been working as a foreman on a 700-acre
 horse ranch in La Cygne, Kansas; on the side, he had a business breaking
 horses. On January 31, Hollon was driving his pickup to Paola for a load
 of supplies when a Paola cop pulled him over for rolling through a stop
 sign. Next thing he knew, the officer was arresting him on an
 outstanding warrant. According to police records, he owed more than
 $10,000 in child support to his ex-wife in Nevada. Protesting that
 he was innocent, Hollon spent the next two weeks in the Miami County
 Jail while authorities arranged for his extradition to Nevada. Sometime
 after sunset on Valentine&apos;s Day, they loaded him into a white van
 divided into three chain-link compartments. He was now a passenger
 with TransCor America, the biggest name in the human-traffic industry.
 Get a speeding ticket out of state? Have unsettled legal troubles in
 California? If there&apos;s a warrant with your name on it and local lawmen
 find you, odds are that TransCor will fetch you. And cheap. The
 Tennessee-based discount prisoner-delivery company can cut inmate
 shipping budgets by 30 percent, its Web site brags. TransCor has done
 business with more than 1,700 law-enforcement agencies across the
 country, schlepping more than 70,000 prisoners a year, the site
 says. But it&apos;s a mostly unsupervised industry. For example,
 federal regulations mandate that a prisoner not spend more than 15 hours
 in a transport van without 8 hours of rest. By conservative estimate,
 Hollon&apos;s 1,500-mile trip from Kansas to Nevada should have taken about
 30 hours. But Hollon spent almost 17 days in transit; for much of that
 time, he was locked in a contorted position, bouncing from state to
 state like a lost package. Watching road signs, he charted his route
 through Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, California and
 Nevada. Company spokeswoman Ashley Nimmo tells the Pitch that each
 TransCor voyage should average about five days. To monitor this, each
 company van is equipped with a GPS system that can track its whereabouts
 within a tenth of a mile. She says that even though pickup and drop-off
 logs confirm that Hollon&apos;s trip lasted nearly 17 days, she has no
 evidence that he was mistreated. Nimmo says all GPS records are deleted
 from the TransCor tracking system after one month. In Nevada,
 Hollon learned that his trek was the result of a paperwork error. He has
 two ex-wives -- both mothers of his children -- one raising a son in
 Nevada and one raising a son and daughter in Ohio. Because he had not
 clearly specified that his bimonthly paycheck garnishments be divided
 equally between his former spouses, Kansas Social and Rehabilitation
 Services had been routing all of his child support to Ohio. Hollon
 pleaded guilty to the charge to get out of the slammer. His trip home
 was shorter. On March 3, he took a Greyhound to Las Vegas, a cab to the
 airport and then a late-night flight back to Kansas City. It took him
 less than 10 hours. Hollon was scheduled to appear in Nevada for a
 preliminary hearing in April, but the charges against him were dropped. (Pitch Weekly) 

 Milwaukee County Jail , Milwaukee, Wisconsin 
 October 15, 2007 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel 
A Milwaukee County Board committee on Tuesday rejected a plan by Sheriff David 
A. Clarke Jr. to privatize inmate transport services with a company in 
Nashville, Tenn. Clarke said the job could be done more efficiently, free 15 
deputies to work on more intensive law enforcement and save the county $325,000 
a year. Supervisors said the move hadn&apos;t been well thought out and should not 
have been included in County Executive Scott Walker&apos;s budget proposal. The 
finance committee voted 6-0 to reject the $1.5 million privatization plan, after 
the Milwaukee Deputy Sheriffs&apos; Association presented information critical of 
TransCor America. The material included news accounts of escapes of prisoners 
being transported by TransCor, which bills itself as the largest inmate 
transport company in the United States. The association filed a lawsuit last 
week to stop the change, arguing that Clarke lacked legal authority to hire an 
outside company for prisoner transport. Supervisors questioned whether public 
safety would be compromised by using a private company for moving inmates. But 
sheriff&apos;s Inspector Kevin Carr said,&quot;I don&apos;t think the citizens in our county 
are going to notice the difference of who picks up the inmates at Waupun (state 
prison) and brings them down here to court.&quot; 

 Oxford , Mississippi 
 December 1, 2004 Daily Mississippian 
 An employee has been fired and equipment
has been adjusted following an investigation into how a prisoner escaped in
Oxford in October. David Randal Moser, 25, was being transported by TransCor, a
private transportation company, from Florida to Ohio to face rape charges when
he escaped in Oxford on Oct. 24. An investigation into how he escaped resulted
into security equipment adjustments and the termination of one employee, said
Ashley Nimmo, director of marketing communications for TransCor. We looked at
equipment and made some adjustments, Nimmo said. One employee has been
released due to violation of company policy. Nimmo said she could not comment
further on the equipment or the employee. TransCor
also paid the Oxford Police Department for the overtime their officers put in to
look for the prisoner.

 Escaped prisoner David Randal Moser lived
in trees near Jackson Avenue for over 58 hours as he evaded police after his
escape Sunday. Moser,
25, who was arrested around 10 p.m. Tuesday. Moser, who has been charged in Ohio
with rape and sexual misconduct with a minor, escaped on foot from a private
transport at Wendys at approximately 12:45 p.m. Sunday. 

 October 26, 2004 Daily Mississippian 
Although police still search in Oxford for escaped prisoner David Randal Moser,
they do not know whether he is in or out of Lafayette County. Moser, 25, who has
been charged in Ohio with sexual conduct with a minor, escaped on foot from a
private transport at Wendys at approximately 2 p.m. Sunday. Stephanie Castle,
a relative of the family that brought the charges against Moser, called The
Daily Mississippian to request an update about Mosers whereabouts. Castle
said she is upset that Moser was allowed to escape. I cant believe these
extradition people have a Web site saying they are high security, Castle
said. Where were the people when he did it (escaped)? I dont get this at
all. It just makes me irate. Moser
was being transported by TransCor, a private prisoner transportation company,
from Florida to Ohio when he escaped. 

 October 25, 2004 Daily Mississippian 
 Police searched for an
escaped prisoner on campus and across Oxford Sunday afternoon through the early
morning hours. As of 1:30 a.m., the search was to no avail. David Randal Moser,
25, escaped on foot from a private transport at Wendys on Jackson Avenue at
approximately 2 p.m. Sunday, a flier said. Moser,
who was in custody for charges of sexual conduct with a minor, was being
transported by Transcor from Florida to Richland County Jail in Mansfield, Ohio. 

 Palm
Beach County Jail , Palm Beach, Florida 
 October 18, 2005 Palm Beach Post 
A federal prisoner got a &apos;Get Out of Jail Free&apos; card from the Palm Beach
 County Jail last week when a paperwork mix-up made jail officials think
 the counterfeiter could be released on bond. Termaine Hollis, 29, was in
 the midst of a 15-month federal prison sentence in Mississippi when he
 was transferred Thursday to the county jail to await a local court
 hearing on a separate misdemeanor charge. There was only one problem:
 Officials say someone along the way forgot the paperwork that pegs
 Hollis as a federal inmate who cannot be released. So when Hollis was
 booked into the jail he was assigned a $500 bond - and didn&apos;t hesitate
 to take it. Who was to blame for the fumble? The sheriff&apos;s office, which
 manages the jail, pointed its finger at TransCor, a private company that
 transports prisoners. Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Paul Miller said the company
 failed to provide jail officials with the necessary paperwork when it
 brought Hollis to Palm Beach County, although he said he didn&apos;t know
 whether that was the company&apos;s mistake or the federal prison&apos;s.&quot;We
 don&apos;t believe the mistake actually occurred at our facility,&quot;Miller said.

 The latest round of campaign finance reports on Pueblo County races 
 reflect a trio of David-and-Goliath contests, at least in financial 
 terms. In the race for sheriff, incumbent Republican Dan Corsentino has 
 raised $133,500 and spent $100,000 as of last week. His Democratic 
 challenger, Kirk Taylor, has raised $41,424 and spent all but $800 of 
 it. Corsentino, who has been sheriff since 1990, had $49,000 in his 
 campaign treasury a year ago and has raised more than $85,000 this year. 
 His most recent report, covering contributions through Oct. 12, includes 
 $1,000 contributions from Transcor America LLC, Aramark political action 
 committee and Motorola PAC, as well as $1,000 each from local residents 
 Keith and Sharon Swerdfeger, Daniel Montano, Thomas Rusler, Gary and 
 Georgia Walker, Larry Mizel of Denver and Richard Lucibella of 
 Oceanridge, Fla. Transcor is a large prisoner transportation company and 
 Aramark is another large company, which has the contract for food 
 service at the county jail.

A Clarksburg manhunt involving state and local police was under way this morning for an escaped prisoner armed with a shotgun and five shells, authorities said. Eight other prisoners also escaped about 5 a.m. from a van being used to transport them, but were later recaptured. The van had stopped so guards could allow the prisoners to go to the restroom at the Eastpointe Chevron, said Greg
 Cumberling, a clerk at the service station. One of the guards came into the store to fill a 5-gallon jug with water and ice, Cumberling said. Then, Cumberling was waiting on another customer when the guard went back outside the store. &quot;He came back in and said, &apos;Call the cops. There&apos;s a fight in the parking lot,&apos; &quot; Cumberling said. Then, Cumberling said, he saw the van take off with the back doors open. He said another guard came through the door shouting, &quot;Call the cops - they just escaped.&quot; (Charleston Daily

 Tower City, North 
Dakota 
 October 7, 2011 AP 
A manhunt for a convicted sex offender who was flushed from a North Dakota 
cornfield with the help of farmers in combines cost law enforcement about 
$55,000, and local authorities said Friday that the transport company moving the 
inmate should pay the bill. California-based Extradition Transport of America 
was moving Joseph Megna from Florida to Washington state. Cass County Sheriff 
Paul Laney said the company, which is bonded and insured for such incidents, is 
cooperating and should pick up the tab.&quot;Their mishandling of this situation 
cost the taxpayers of all these entities a lot of money,&quot;Laney said. Laney said 
the company could face sanctions under a federal law, sponsored by former North 
Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, that was prompted by the escape of a man who murdered 
a Fargo girl in 1993. Kyle Bell, convicted of killing 11-year-old Jeanna North, 
fled in 1999 from a private prison transport bus. Extradition Transport of 
America declined comment. Megna, 29, escaped during a rest stop Tuesday night 
near Tower City. Authorities said he was in plain clothes and wasn&apos;t handcuffed. 
He surrendered Wednesday afternoon after farmers in a half-dozen combines - each 
with SWAT team members as escorts - harvested about 100 acres of corn.&quot;This is 
unique in the sense that, God bless North Dakota, we bring everybody together to 
solve the problem and we put guys up on combines,&quot;Laney said. Megna was 
surprised by the attention he received.&quot;Am I famous for running into a 
cornfield?&quot;he asked a group of reporters through an open window in the back 
seat of a police sport utility vehicle. Costs include officer overtime, fuel and 
mileage for ground vehicles, a helicopter and an airplane. The farmers who 
volunteered their time and equipment will be compensated for fuel, mileage and 
wear and tear on the combines, Laney said.

 A high-risk sex offender who escaped a prisoner transport van and sought 
refuge in a cornfield near here was nabbed by law enforcement about 2:30 p.m. 
today. Joseph Megna, 29, said he&apos;s a vegetarian and the&quot;transport lady&quot;was 
serving him nothing but bread and cheese.&quot;I was starving and that&apos;s why I 
escaped and fled out into the cornfield,&quot;he said after being captured.&quot;I 
wasnt trying to hurt anybody. Authorities tapped the help of local farmers in 
an attempt to end the large-scale manhunt that began more than 20 hours ago 
after Mgna, a convicted high-risk sex offender from Washington state, fled a 
transport van near here Tuesday. 

 Transcor
America 
 April 9, 2012 Courthouse News 
A prisoner-transportation company may have to pay punitive damages if it loses a 
wrongful death suit over an inmate who died of heatstroke, a federal judge 
ruled. On June 23, 2009, Joseph Curtis was transported from the federal prison 
in Leavenworth, Kan., through Illinois, to the federal prison in Terre Haute, 
Ind. The temperature that day was 95 degrees, and the TransCor America van 
bringing Joseph to Terre Haute had a broken air conditioner. Joseph passed out 
en route and died later that day. The autopsy listed heatstroke as cause of 
death, a homicide. Brett Curtis, Joseph&apos;s son, filed suit for negligence and 
wrongful death. Curtis contended that TransCor management decided to continue 
the trip even though it knew about the broken air conditioner and the lack of a 
thermometer in the prisoner compartment. He also claimed that TransCor employees 
ignored other prisoners who indicated Joseph was in distress. When Joseph became 
unconscious, TransCor operations director Charles Westbrook allegedly directed 
the drivers to bring the inmate to the prison rather than a hospital. Though the 
case is pending in the Northern District of Illinois, Curtis asked the court to 
consider punitive damages under Tennessee law, which permits such awards in 
wrongful-death cases. TransCor is headquartered in Tennessee. U.S. District 
Judge James Holderman granted Curtis&apos; motion, finding that&quot;Tennessee law has 
the strongest connection to the facts and circumstances of this case as it 
relates to the imposition of punitive damages given that Tennessee was both the 
site of at least some of the alleged misconduct and is site of TransCor&apos;s 
headquarters.&quot;&quot;The location of the injury was somewhat fortuitous in that 
Joseph had no choice as to how and when he was transported or where he became 
ill,&quot;Holderman wrote.&quot;Nor is it solely TransCor&apos;s conduct in Illinois and 
Indiana that is at issue here. Curtis alleges that his father&apos;s death was the 
culmination of oversights and poor decisions by TransCor employees in Tennessee, 
Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois.&quot;&quot;Illinois and Indiana have an interest in the 
application of their punitive damages law to a company that regularly does 
business in their states, but that interest is lessened where Joseph was not a 
resident of either state, and where the location of Joseph&apos;s injury was to a 
certain degree fortuitous,&quot;the March 29 decision states.&quot;As a whole, the court 
finds that Tennessee has a stronger connection to the facts and circumstances of 
Joseph&apos;s death than does Illinois or Indiana, and that this connection is 
sufficient to overcome any presumption that the law of the place of injury 
should apply.&quot;

The American Civil Liberties Union disclosed Tuesday that it has obtained&quot;a substantial settlement&quot;for a female prisoner who said she was
sexually assaulted by a guard while being transported between jails in Texas and
Colorado. The settlement ends a 3-year-old lawsuit filed against TransCor
America, a Tennessee-based private extradition company, now owned by Corrections
Corporation of America. The amount was not disclosed. &quot;No woman
should ever have to endure what our client went through,&quot;said Cynthia Kok,
a co-counsel in the case. &quot;And no amount of money can make up for
it.&quot; The lawsuit alleges that in March 1998 she was assaulted while
in shackles while being returned to Fremont County to face a theft charge. Kok said she knows of four other lawsuits against TransCor, stemming from
similar incidents, including two lawsuits in Colorado, one in Texas and one in
Virginia. In March, lawyers for TransCor admitted to the court that they
had learned of five other cases of sexual misconduct by transport guards working
for the company. (Rocky Mountain News)

agreement to settle the suit was disclosed yesterday in a company filing with the SEC that provided information on a recent agreement to refinance its debt.   In
the filing, CCA also said that the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had put up for bid contracts that expired last month under which the company houses 2,535 state inmates at company-owned prisons in that state.   Instead
of renewing CCA&apos;s contracts, Oklahoma put out a request for proposals that covers all inmates in six privately owned and operated prisons in the state, including three managed by other private operators. (Tennessean.com)

 A prisoner transportation company that has been accused of losing and mistreating inmates allowed the escape of a Wisconsin teen who later made his way to Texas, where he is charged with attempting to kill a police officer. Officials at TransCor America Inc. acknowledge their employee botched the case of the teenage runaway, who wasn&apos;t handcuffed when he fled Mitchell International Airport June 19. The Darien teen stayed on the lam for six days after escaping from the TransCor guard, stealing two cars in Missouri as he headed for Mexico, authorities said. (Milwaukee Journal

 West Virginia 
 Three prisoners who were trapped in a van after it was hijacked in 2001 by a fellow prisoner have filed a lawsuit against the van&apos;s transport company and two of the company&apos;s former employees. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of Frederick Furlong, Michael Wolf and David Adams by Morgantown lawyer Jennifer McGinley in U.S. District Court in Clarksburg. In September 2001 Christopher Paul Savage overpowered two transport officers at a Clarksburg gas station after faking an illness. He then used the van he and other prisoners were being transported in to escape. Savage later abandoned the van and ran away on foot. He was arrested almost two months afterward in Georgia. The lawsuit alleges the transport drivers&apos; negligence led to Savage&apos;s escape and the prisoners&apos; kidnapping - during which, the prisoners were denied proper food, drink and bathroom breaks and were deprived of medication. The lawsuit alleges Nashville, Tenn.-based TransCor America, Inc. already knew of training and supervision problems among its drivers.
