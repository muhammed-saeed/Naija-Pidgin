 2 dumb thieves use a key to get inside jewelry shop to steal safe 
02-29-2008
2 burglars broke into the One Dollar Jewelry Galore store in Tulsa. Police say it was an inside job and say they suspect an employee at the store possibly gave the suspects a key.

The manager says she was totally surprised when she heard the news and that she would never expect anything like this from an employee. The suspects came in through a door, went behind the counter and stole the safe. Luckily, the store has great surveillance video.

In color and crystal-clear, police say it is exactly the quality of video that puts criminals in jail. You can see the two thieves use a key to get inside. They then walk behind the counter and steal the safe. You can also see their get-away car parked in front. But before they take off, they throw a rock at the glass door, and then kick it in.

&quot;It&apos;s a very interesting burglary,&quot; says Detective Debra Glenn. &quot;You don&apos;t see instances like this very often.&quot;

Between the key, the door-bashing and another piece of video police haven&apos;t downloaded yet, detectives concluded the burglars knew someone on the inside.

&quot;Apparently, an employee passed some information onto the suspect before the burglary and they used that to get into the building,&quot; Glenn says.

Cynthia Schneider never thought one of her own employees would steal from her store. She knows all of them very well and most of their parents.

&quot;I was stunned, very shocked,&quot; Schneider says. &quot;It&apos;s just very upsetting to know you&apos;ve worked with these girls, you interviewed them and you have been very nice and paid them well and then they take advantage of you.&quot;

The thieves stole close to four-thousand dollars. Police haven&apos;t caught them yet, and they say, Cynthia&apos;s employee mysteriously disappeared. But, with this clear surveillance video, detectives say it&apos;s only a matter of time before they&apos;re caught.

&quot;Be careful where you go and what you do because there are cameras everywhere.&quot;

Police also tell us the thieves knew about the surveillance cameras. They took the DVD. But, fortunately, the store has a backup
