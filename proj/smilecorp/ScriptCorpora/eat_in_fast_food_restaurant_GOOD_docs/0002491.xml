 Ideas from Classroom Teachers for 
Counting Techniques and Elementary Probability Theory
 
A certain experiment is defined as follows: &quot;A small bowl contains 6 marbles3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green. Pick one marble at random . Record the outcome .&quot; Q: What are the possible outcomes? (Set of all possible outcomes = the sample space .)

First, make a chart listing each possible outcome. Ask the students to predict the probability that a person will draw a blue marble on one pick. Replacing the marble each time, predict the probability of drawing a red, then a green. The resulting chart is an example of theoretical probability . This is what we would expect to happen if the experiment were repeated many times.

Here’‘s a different approach: Each student comes up and draws one marble and replaces it; one student records the results in a tally. The resulting chart will show each outcome with its frequency. Convert the results into relative frequency . Using these results to predict the probability of obtaining a given outcome in this situation is an example of experimental or empirical probability . You can discuss how and why these results may differ from the theoretical probability of each outcome. (With more and more trials, the empirical probability would become closer to the theoretical probabilityThe Law of Large Numbers.)

The idea of compound events and independent or dependent events can be incorporated by redefining the experiment: Select 2 marbles, one at a time, without replacement. (The set of outcomes will also be different.) The probability of selecting a red marble on the second pick cannot be determined unless we know the result of the first pick; i.e., pick 2 is dependent on pick 1. Now, if we pick two marbles with replacement, then the picks are independent. This entire activity can be accomplished in 3 -5 days and covers many of the topics in this chapter.

Ohio’‘s Data OMAP provides several hands-on lessons that could be used to ignite student enthusiasm and deepen their understanding of the concepts listed.

I have gone to a local fast food restaurant to jot down several menu options, then used these options to have students count how many different trays of food can be made given a set number of choices.

License plate problems work well here.

This section can be enhanced by computing probabilities in games, talking about risk, etc.

I would offer some alternative assessment, perhaps a project type that allows students to gather data and then create graphs and provide the assessor with information that demonstrates that the learner has an understanding of probability. Letting students design their own experiments or using teacher outlined plans allows for more authentic learning.

Tree diagrams and geometric models work well for determining sample space and probability.

A good resource: Navigating Through Probability: Grades 9-12 , NCTM.

This topic lends itself to authentic assessment using real-world situations involving probability, e.g., weather predictions, insurance, lottery, etc. (The data can be collected outside of class.) For ideas, see Mathematics AssessmentA Practical Handbook for grades 6-8 and 9-12, NCTM.
