 Grease Trap Cleaning

 Grease traps are an essential part of a restaurant&apos;s sewer and drainage system. By keeping grease and other materials from going down the drain, they help keep the sewer line free of build up and flowing freely. Once a grease trap becomes full, it allows grease to enter the sewer system, creating build up that will eventually result in a clog in your sewer system.

Whether your grease trap is 5 gallons or 10,000 gallons, John&apos;s Sewer&amp;Pipe Cleaning can create a custom preventive maintenance plan to meet your needs.
- Why Choose Preventive Maintenance? 
 
 Grease trap cleaning
 John&apos;s Sewer&amp;Pipe Cleaning, Inc. offers our clients fast emergency grease trap cleaning and timely scheduled maintenance. We also snake the line every single time we clean a grease trap; ask our competitors if they can say that.

 Scheduling regular service
 The Boston Water&amp;Sewer Commission recommends that grease traps are cleaned on a monthly basis or when they are 1/4 full of grease. If you setup a preventive maintenance agreement with John&apos;s, we will track your cleaning schedule for you. Also, we work around your schedule by coming in early in the morning or late at night.

 Snaking the line
 We&apos;ll start your sewer line service by running a flexible, metal device down the line. This device is called a &apos;snake.&apos; It helps us feel for any damage in the line, and can dislodge most blockages. Most of the time, this simple service is enough to get a newer sewer line up and running.

 Video inspection
 If snaking the line uncovers any problems, we may use video inspection to get a closer look. This involves inserting a tiny camera in the sewer line and recording everything we see. The camera is on the end of a long cable, just like the snake, so we&apos;re able to run it down the line to find the problem. Learn more about video sewer inspection .

 Locating the problem area
 Once our video inspection camera has reached the blockage or damage in your line, we&apos;re able to pinpoint its exact location in the ground and depth. That way, when it&apos;s time to dig, we&apos;ll know right where to start.

 Your free estimate
 Video inspection allows us to provide you with a DVD or VHS cassette of your sewer, along with a free estimate for your repairs. And, since you&apos;re dealing with a full-service specialist in sewers, we can do all the necessary excavation and repairs to get your sewer up and running.

 Excavation and repair
 Many sewer service companies will send you to the yellow pages as soon as they uncover a problem with your line. But we are a full-service sewer specialist, so you never need to look any further than John&apos;s for a solution. Once we&apos;ve identified the problem in your sewer line, we can help you fix it. Learn more about our excavation and repair services. If possible, we will suggest a discounted preventive maintenance program to keep the line running. If the problem is more serious, we can excavate and repair or replace the line for you.

 Video Inspection 

 Water Jetting In Action! 
(AVI Video - 3,486KB) 

Video inspection (or closed circuit television inspection) is a very cost-effective method for diagnosing problems within a main sewer line. By looking inside the line, we&apos;re able to accurately identify and locate any blockages or damages. Our equipment is able to search up to 400 feet of line, working inside diameters as large as 10&apos; and as small as 2&apos;.
 
 Digital record of inspection
 When we use video inspection on a sewer line, we can produce a DVD or VHS cassette of the procedure. This allows you to see the problem for yourself, and it allows us to provide an accurate, free estimate for your repair.

In addition to keeping a DVD or video of the pipe inspection, you will also receive a video inspection report detailing potential problems, their severity and their exact location.

 Locating potential problems
 The video inspection equipment has a transmitter that sends a signal from the camera head to a locator used above ground. This allows us to determine where the line is going as well as to pinpoint the exact location and depth of a problem area.

 Floor Drains 

Floor drains help you maintain safe, sanitary conditions in your kitchen. You can help them do their job with regular cleaning and maintenance. The floor drains in your kitchen are essential to keeping a clean, healthy environment for both your food and your employees. But for a floor drain to do its job, it needs to be clean. John&apos;s Sewer&amp;Pipe Cleaning, Inc. offers custom preventive maintenance plans as well as fast emergency service to keep your kitchen&apos;s drain flowing freely and your chef&apos;s feet dry!
 
 Don&apos;t settle for a quick fix
 Drain cleaning solutions and a plunger may get things moving, but it won&apos;t last for long. These traditional fixes don&apos;t get to the root of the problem, and they can&apos;t remove the build up that collects in restaurant drains. In addition to being toxic and dangerous, these methods are only short term solutions. The best way to ensure fewer backups is to have the line snaked by a professional drain cleaner.

 Best Solution - Snake the Line
 John&apos;s Sewer&amp;Pipe Cleaning uses motorized snake machines that use torque on a rotating cable to scrape the inside of your drains and pipes clean. The snake breaks up debris inside your line and either pulls it out of the line or sends it out to the main line.
