First day job trial at a fast food restaurant?
 Hi, I was told I would have an interview and a trial at a fast food mexican joint. I had about 10 minutes of training whilst watching somebody else take the orders, and then I was left to do it by myself. I made a few normal mistakes, and had to ask a few questions, then the boss came and took me out for an interview because she wasnt there when i started my shift, just asked me my availabilities again and said that they would order me a shirt in, then the manager got my number and told me to send him my availabilities for this/next week. they never said i got the job though.. did i?
