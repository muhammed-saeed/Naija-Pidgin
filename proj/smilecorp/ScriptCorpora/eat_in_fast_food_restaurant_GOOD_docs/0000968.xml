 5 Napkin Burger

Great Food
 
The food here is really worth the hype! I loved it. I usually try and go looking for a deal before I head out to dinner though so I spent a little more than normal.

Great Experience
 
We had an amazing time at 5 Napkin. Our waitress was great. The food was awesome. I&apos;d love to go back the next time I&apos;m in NYC.

Not so great
 
My husband and I were not very impressed. The burgers were OK, very expensive, and greasy! The french fries were a little soggy, but the onion rings were very tasty. We definitely wouldn&apos;t return....just not worth the calories or price.

Best Onion Rings in the City
 
The onion rigns are by far the best in the city. I feel like most people like onion rings, but its such a gamble ordering them. If you do check this place out you should get them, you won&apos;t be disappointed. They are perfectly cooked in a very tastey batter. The only real negative I have about the place is that at times it can be crowded and noisey. Other than that, I&apos;ve had at least 10 - 15 well above average meals ranging from breakfast(brunch) to the burgers.

Poor Service
 
We arrived with a large party, including 2 children - our wait was twice as long as they projected. We sat the kids on the bar stools and the bartender was rude in asking us to move the. In addition, we were seated at 2 separate tables and one was finished eating, before the second was even served. The manager seemed annoyed that we asked for him and gave us nothing but poor excuses. The food was good but not worth the wait or aggravation. Would not go back or advise anyone else to.

rude manager
 
our group arrived and were told we had a 45 minute wait. 1 1/2 hours later we were seated at two separate tables. one table was finished with dinner while the second table hadn&apos;t even received their appetizers. when we asked for the manager. he came over and was rude and seemed incapable of understanding why we were upset with the poor service. we live in nyc and any good restaurant will at least make an attempt at offering an apology, if not make an adjustment to the check. as good as the food was, we won&apos;t be back.
