 No room in the Elbow Room Posted Friday, March 20, 2009 by Jason Gergely A few weeks ago before I left for my spring break, we decided to grab lunch at this little place just north of the circle on Pennsylvania. Elbow room is a great Indianapolis restaurant that everyone needs to stop by at some point. 

When the marketing team here at Compendium went, we all happen to order something different, which was good to give us some insight on their expansive menu.

 Mikey ordered a veggie burger. When I asked him what he thought about it he did the&quot; Raise the Roof &quot;motion. He said that it was good and his burger had a lot of flavor. Also he really liked the bar and thought it might be a good place to check out. Maybe for a game? or just to have a couple drinks with friends?

 Meghan ordered the strawberry chicken salad and was very impressed with the fact that they had Fat Free dressings for a healthier alternative. She said that her food was very flavorful, even with it being a more health conscious meal.

 Megan had the Turkey Bourbon sandwich and found it to be very good. She mentioned that it was a bit crowded, but if you are going to grab lunch with co-workers, you have to commit and make sure that you have enough time.

Chandra at the cob salad with chicken and found it to be tasty as well. She said the staff were very friendly and very efficient. However, she said that the place was small,&quot;hense the name &apos;Elbow Room&apos;&quot;Also she mentioned something about her dressing being soupy... so watch out and be prepared!

As for me, I ordered the American Burger. It was a harty meal consisting of a burger, with American cheese, red onions, lettuce, and bacon. And to go along with it, I ordered the fries... oh how i love fries.

I think we all would agree that it was a great downtown Indianapolis restaurant. However, the rush comes around noon, so if you are going there for lunch, just get there a little early.

So if you are looking for a good downtown Indianapolis restaurant, you should think about going to Elbow room, located at 605 N. Pennsylvania. You can check out their website and their menu online!

 Why I love Scotty&apos;s Posted Monday, February 23, 2009 by BJ McKay Scotty&apos;s Brewhouse in Downtown Indianapolis boasts the largest restaurant menu in Indianapolis. If you are looking at Indianapolis New Restaurants take a trip to Scotties.

 

As an aside, I used to wait tables at the Original Scotties in Muncie, IN and if I can vouch for nothing less it is easily the cleanest restaurant in the entire universe. 

As for the management, Scott Wise is the caliber of restaurant owner that I wish I could be! He&apos;s a risk taking, innovative, marketing machine. If that weren&apos;t enough, his restaurant delivers on all his promises. 




The experience is incredibly consistent for the volume of customers that Scotty&apos;s serves everyday. Scotty&apos;s will compete and win business away from other Downtown Indianapolis Restaurants because he is willing to earn you away. That cannot be underestimated for a restaurantuer. (Did I spell that right?)

Another homerun from a marketer that all Indianpolis restaurant owner&apos;s should take notes from.

 A Chocolate Place That Has More than Just Chocolate Posted Friday, December 12, 2008 by Jason Gergely Ok, so I delayed blogging about last Friday&apos;s lunch. I have good reason... I got distracted. Anyway, last week the Marketing Team here at Compendium chose a place to eat downtown Indianapolis called South Bend Chocolate Cafe . Along with the usual marketing team we took newcomer, Chandra.

So for our lunch dinning experience, I believe that all of us agreed that it was a great place to go. Megan first spoke up and said that her food was excellent. She had ordered the Chicken Fajita Panini with pepperjack cheese with a Tomato Bisque soup and pretzles (or chips) and pickle that came with her meal (which no one saw coming). Megan also mentioned that it was a good place to grab a sandwich and soup. Meghan and I both ordered the Ham and Cheese Panini along with Chedder and Broccoli soup. Meghan felt that it was good food and while you are there, you can see the many desserts they have to offer. She said that &quot;you&apos;ll be eating your lunch and craving your dessert&quot;. I would recommend it for a great restaurant in Indianapolis, if you just want a place to sit down from walking around the circle on cold winter day or a during the summer. Chantelle ordered the Grilled Cheese with Ruffles Crinkle Potato chips (which I guess is the kind of chips they use... I didn&apos;t really notice). She ordered off of the kids menu and said that the kid&apos;s meal has a lot of food for the value. Chantelle also mentioned that the next time she goes, she wants to try the &quot;Fondue for Four&quot;. (We aren&apos;t completely sure what it is, but it sounds like a lot of fun!). Mikey ordered the &quot;Hot Ham and Cheese with Tomatoes, Blue Cheese and it was really good!&quot; He also ordered the Chicken and Dumpling soup. Mikey mentioned that it is a harty meal for a cold day (and it really was a cold day). Our newcomer, Chandra (who is our new Business Manager) ordered the Ham and Cheese with garden vegetable soup. She said it was very hot and &quot;Yumo&quot; (and I think that means it was good, or tasty, or any exclamation you might use for a appetizing food meal).

After our meal, we decided that the Southbend Chocolate Cafe was overall very good, and the service was very friendly. Also, if you want extras on the sandwiches on the menu, you can ask for extras and they won&apos;t charge you for them. The atmosphere was amazing. You could smell the chocolate and candies in the air. Meghan also pointed out that you could purchase bags of carmel corn, chocolate covered pretzles, etc, to buy and eat for a good afternoon snack. Also, if you want to visit during the summer, there is outside seating so that you may enjoy the day as well as your delicious sandwich. However, after you leave you may find that you smell like the restaurant for the rest of the day. So if you get a free lunch break in downtown Indianapolis, check out the Southbend Chocolate Factory Cafe , located right on the circle, at 20 North Meridian(There is also a satillite location in the new Indianapolis International Airport.)

 Moe&apos;s - The Place for Great Steaks Posted Monday, December 1, 2008 by Jason Gergely I have always been a steak guy. Some people dowse their steak with ketchup (which always makes me cringe just thinking about) or even with a little steak sauce.. which is a little better, but for me... I have always have liked my steak plain with all its juices... cooked medium rare (is your mouth watering yet?)

Well if you are into steaks there is a great place here in Indy to try out. Moe&apos;s... A Place for Steaks is one of the best steak restaurants in Indy. It is kind of an upscale restaurant with a vast wine selection along with a lounge to enjoy a cigar and a glass of scotch (or wine and a cigar... whatever you please). If you go I would recommend the Shrimp Cocktail or the Bruschetta as your appetizer. As for the entree, you really can&apos;t go wrong with any of the steaks there. They also have alternatives such as chicken and lobster if you or anyone you are with are not a steak person. Also, make sure you save room for dessert because they have a small but delicious dessert menu that you need to check when you go!

As for the atmosphere... perfect. You can go there for almost any occasion. If you want to go out on a romantic date or a business meeting. They also have private dining available for banquets and private parties.

So if you are looking for a great steak restaurant in Indianapolis, you should check out Moe&apos;s... A Place for Steaks . It is located at 47 South Pennsylvania Street.

 The Best Burger In Indianapolis Quest Continues - Workingman&apos;s Friend Posted Sunday, November 23, 2008 by Chris Baggott Workingman&apos;s Friend 
234 N Belmont Ave
Indianapolis IN 46222
(317) 636-2067

DO NOT FEAR Workingman&apos;s Friend.  This is a classic Indianapolis Lunch Restaurant that in spite of it&apos;s appearance serves one of the best burgers in Indy. Close to Downtown Indianapolis Workingman&apos;s friend is full of the white collar types as well and a lot of physicians for some reason...probably because it&apos;s close to IUPUI and the Med Center.

Workingman&apos;s Friend is an old fashioned Indianapolis Pub and nothing more. The kind of place your dad would go after the 3 to 11 shift at the plant.  Take my advice, great burger, great bar and great people is why this makes the cut in my Indianapolis Menu Guide.

 Best Burger Quest Continues - Bub&apos;s Burgers Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Bub&apos;s 
210 W Main St
Carmel IN 46032
(317) 706-2827
 website    

Located in the Art&apos;s&amp;Design District of Carmel Indiana (about 8 miles from downtown Indianapolis) and just of the Monon Trail might just be a restaurant with the Best Hamburger in Indy.

Handpattied from fresh ground beef, these hamburgers are so special that the owners Matt&amp;Rachel Frey need to have special buns supplied locally from one of our great Indianapolis Bakeries.  Although Bub&apos;s (Big Ugly Burger) is most famous for it&apos;s hamburgers, several people tell me that they compete well as a seafood restaurant Indianapolis with a Mahi Mahi filet. Bub&apos;s is also a popular stop of Ice Cream in the summer for those traveling the Monon Trail.  

In my quest for the Best Burger in Indy I&apos;ve had the chance to write a lot for this Indianapolis Menu Guide. Mostly I focus on Downtown Indianapolis Restaurants, but Bub&apos;s Burgers now gives me a new reason to visit Carmel.

 The Quest for the Best Burger In Indianapolis - 5 Guys Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Five Guys 
2902 W 86th St
Indianapolis IN 46268
(317) 876-0811

Any credible blog seeking the best restaurant Indianapolis has to have a special place for the best hamburger in Indy right?  I love burgers and am constantly soliciting recommendations.  Well this one: Five Guys is a great new addition to my Indianapolis menu guide.

Now keep in mind, Five Guys is a chain but it&apos;s also a really good burger, not your usual fast food Indianapolis joint. The menu has only three things Hamburgers, Hot Dogs and Fries.  In those catagories Five Guys streaches a little including Kosher Style, Bacon, Cheese for the Dogs, Five Guys Style or Cajun for the fries ( cooked in pure peanut oil ) The claim to fame on the hamburgers is the choice of any or all 15 toppings...all no extra charge.

If your date is a vegitarian, they do have an option of a veggie sandwich using any of the burger toppings and a grilled cheese sandwich...hmmm Maybe I&apos;ll start a quest fo the best Grilled Cheese in Indianpolis next....

If you want to put in a restaurant review indianpolis post, just hit me with an email.  c hris@compendiumblogware.com

 Deano&apos;s Wine Bar&amp;Restaurant - Indianapolis Restaurant Review Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Deano&apos;s Wine Bar&amp;Restaurant 
1112 Shelby St 
 Indianapolis , IN 46203 
 (317) 423-3154 ‎

Indianapolis Nightlife, Wine, fine dining?  OMG thank you for Deano&apos;s Wine Bar&amp;Restaurant!

Located just off Fountain Square this is sincerely one of the best restaurants in Indianapolis.  Just about a mile from downtown, owners Dean Wilson and Jody Bryant have created something that is truly unique.  With a motto of &quot;Good food, good wine and good friends&quot; these guys have really come through in creating a great Indianapolis date restaurant.

Oh...did I mention they have music on weekends? How&apos;s that for those of you looking for some Indianapolis Nightlife that&apos;s for adults?

The dinner menu has lots of seafood like a smoked salmon platter appetizer or a &quot;more crab than cake&quot; Crab Cake. What Indianapolis fine dining restaurant review would be complete without a shrimp cocktail? ( Shrimp Cocktail is to Indianapolis Restaurants like wings are in Buffalo...available everywhere )

The appetizer menu even includes an Italian restaurant touch with four different Pizza&apos;s and a portabella&amp;pistachio salad.   Entrees cover seafood to chicken to beef. As an Atkins eater who is trying to eat more locally produced food, I was thrilled to see Indiana Bison Steaks on the menu...pared with a suggested Petite Sirah......perfect.

Writing this Indiana Dining Guide is makeing me hungry...

 Bosphorus Istanbul Cafe - Not a Greek Restaruant Posted Saturday, November 22, 2008 by Chris Baggott Bosphorus Istanbul Cafe 
935 S East St
Indianapolis, IN 46225
(317) 974-1770‎
bosphoruscafe.com


If you are looking for great Hummus or an awesome Falafel, look no further than Bosphorus Istanbul Cafe for what I think is Indianapolis only Turkish restaurant. 

If you are looking for great Indianapolis fine dining is a funky purple house near Fletcher Place ( just outside downtown Indianapolis ) this might just be your restaurant.  Named for a 20 mile long strait that joins the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea, the real Bosphorus separates Europe from Asia....ok enough about the geography of the near east...let&apos;s talk about the food!

No Indianapolis menu guide would be complete without including the Hummus and Feta Chees Plate appetizers. Better yet, start your party with the Appetizer combo that also includes stuffed grape leaves, tabouli, babaganush, borek and and eggplant salsa.

As an Indianapolis Date Restaruant why not impress him (or her) with you vast cusine knowlage by ordering the Iskender or Ispankli Tavuk?  This is a great local Indianapolis Restaurant.  It&apos;s not quite an Asian Restaruant and is kind of like an Indianapolis Greek Restaurant but ...different.  I&apos;m really happy to add Bosphorus to my Indianapolis Dining Guide.

 High End Downtown Indianapolis Restaurant for Lunch or Dinner Posted Thursday, November 13, 2008 by Chris Baggott Once again my good friend Nicki Laycoax of Squish Designs has come up with a fantastic review of another place to go under the category: best restaurant Indianapolis. 
 
14 West Restaurant at 14 West Maryland 
 www.14westindy.com 

14 West Maryland Street
Indianapolis, Indiana, 46204
Telephone: (317) 636-1414
Email:    customerservice@14westindy.com

A colleague of mine that I met as a result of blogging, treated me to a nice lunch at 14 West Restaurant. It was my first visit, but had heard great things about the restaurant and the suites that are above this downtown Indianapolis restaurant, from multiple people.

The restaurant has a great wine list, exciting menu, and very able catering
staff. ( I thought I saw a full bar, but I can&apos;t confirm from the website )
Ashley Sorenson, the very sweet and professional Hotel and
Banquet Manager made certain that our dining experience was great!

In the picture, you are looking at the Caesar Salad topped with
Seared Tuna as well as the Crab Cakes. We also had the Red Garnet
Yam Soup and the Lobster Brie Macaroni&amp;Cheese.;

This restaurant is recommended for those on a professional lunch or
dinner meeting and would also be a nice spot for a romantic Indianapolis date restaurant. At lunch, the music playing in the background was modern adult contemporary. It was a nice change from what I normally hear in restaurants.

Summary: Food was absolutely excellent. Prices were moderate. Service was perfect.

 Reserve your table now!

 Buggs Temple a new (to me) downtown Indianapolis Lunch Restaruant Posted Monday, November 10, 2008 by Chris Baggott Buggs Temple 
337 W 11th Street
Indianapolis, Indiana 46202
317.955.2389

So how do I evaluate a downtown Indianapolis restaurant? Especially for Lunch?  Ambiance, convenience and food.  To me, to get a designation as one of the best lunch restaurants in Indianapolis you have to start with how it feels.  Most of the time you want a place you can have a conversation, a restaurant that’s attractive and friendly….a place that’s cool so you glow in how cool it is to your guest.

Buggs Temple at the north end of the Downtown Indy Canal meets that criteria. I never even heard of Buggs Temple before 11am this morning, but Kyle Saylers of Clarian Health Ventures treated me today and it was fantastic. It’s a great old church located right on the tip of the Canal. It was a little bit of a hike from my office on the downtown Indianapolis Circle and I saw there was plenty of parking. Inside were huge windows looking over the canal…it was a little chilly for the outside deck, but it looked beautiful. The waiters were fantastic, fun, knew the menu and were wearing June Cleaver aprons, Our guy knew the menu, was friendly and attentive while giving us plenty of space to have our conversation.

I&apos;ve not been to this Indianapolis downtown restaurant at night, but imagine it&apos;s a great place for a date.  Supposedly there is an upstairs that has terrific views and is one of the top spots for Indianapolis fine dining. The menu did include Steak and Seafood along with great grilled sandwiches. I had a Cuban, which came with a fresh mixed salad. I&apos;m not sure about breakfast, and their website is one of the worst I&apos;ve ever seen.

 Italian Restaurant Indianapolis...(actually Carmel) Macaroni Grill? Posted Tuesday, November 4, 2008 by Chris Baggott 
 
 Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill 
Carmel Indiana
2375 116th East
Carmel, IN 46032
317-582-1637



Today I had a great lunch up in Carmel Indiana with Patty Bender of Compendium Blogware client Sheetz Century 21 . 

I&apos;ve never been to a Macaroni Grill before and usually try and avoid the big box eateries on Indy&apos;s north side. If I&apos;m looking for the best Italian food in Indianapolis, I&apos;m not sure this would be my first choice. 

Until now that is.  Every time I have this experience, I have to just say: &quot;Chris Baggott: Get over yourself&quot;  Romano&apos;s Macaroni Grill is awesome. I can&apos;t say for dinner, but for a lunch restaurant it was fantastic. The environment is high end Italian cusine. I love an Italian Restaurant that has bread and olive oil on the table....just sets the quality meter up right from the start.

I had the Grilled Halibut Seasoned halibut topped with a tomato basil relish and served with pesto Parmesan risotto for $16.99. Clever marketers that they are, each item on the menu was accompanied by the Chef&apos;s Recommended Wine. In this case a Chardonnay by Mezzacorona (Italy). 

I&apos;m guessing that this place packs them in at night, but the bar is huge and looks like a lot of fun.  Patty and I kept it to business and didn&apos;t indulge in any wine or cocktails, but for a lunch meeting is was one of the best restaurant experiences I&apos;ve had in Indianapolis.

One last great thing about Romano’s Macaroni Grill is their Curbside to Go program. Call or order Indianapolis Best Italian food online and pick it up at the curb.  They have great to-go family style food too!

oh..and they teach you Italian in the bathroom and on the site:


 Impress Mom and Pop with anniversary wishes spoken in Italian. Or learn how to celebrate
 the evening - Italian style. 
 Sample: English - &quot;Happy Anniversary!&quot; Italian 
 - &quot;Felice anniversario! 
 
 
 Listen to It in Italian here....

 Usual Suspects Bar&amp;Restaurant Posted Monday, November 3, 2008 by Ellie Cummins Usual Suspects , located above well known basement bar in Broad Ripple, The Casba, is an upscale, yet casual Indianapolis restaurant/bar featuring great food and drinks. Enjoy a great dinner in a quiet atmosphere in the evening and then hang around as things get a bit louder into the night as this place is a favorite of the &quot;late 20&apos;s and up&quot; crowd in the neighborhood.

As a former ethnic Indianapolis restaurant, Greek to be exact, the menu featur es great hummus and pita appetizers and Gyro entrees. Stuffed quesadillas, unique salads, mini burgers, and traditional entrees round out the menu. I reccomend the shrimp or caprese quesadilla and the hummus and pita appetizer. 

 Usual Suspects also features a great bar. Fresh sqeezed juice cocktails are a house specialty, the martini list has all the traditional faves, and the bartenders are always ready to make a good drink suggestion. Although not a true sports bar, the are several flat screen tv&apos;s around and it is a good place to watch a game if you&apos;re not in the mood for the traditional sports bar Indianapolis atmosphere.

 Usual Suspects is located at
 6319 Guilford Ave., Indianapolis, IN, 46220 (317) 251-3138

Open: 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesday, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 5
p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday, closed
Monday. Bar open late.

 Brunch At Zest! Posted Friday, October 31, 2008 by Ellie Cummins I enjoyed brunch for the first time at Indianapolis restaurant Zest! last weekend and my experience and my meal were fantastic! This
neighborhood cafe is located in &quot;SoBro&quot; and features brunch and lunch
fare as well as the occasional special dinner event. We were promptly
greeted and offered coffee while we waited for a table. Although it
looked crowded the restaurant was much bigger than it appeared and we
were seated within a few minutes.
 
 Zest! touts
a menu of homestyle foods with an urban fare and is open 7 a.m. to 2
p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday,
closed Sunday and Monday. Shop open until 4 p.m. through the week.  

 I enjoyed the breakfast burrito which was filled with deliciousness! Of course it had eggs and sausage and cheeses but the kicker was the
fresh avocado, black beans, and yummy salsa. It was great! My fellow
diners enjoyed the panini and homestyle breakfast offers. These
offerings also had the traditional breakfast ingredients with some
extra special ingredients that were great.

This lovely establishment with its inviting decor, courteous staff
will definitely remain on my list as a fave for Indianapolis breakfast
restaurants and among the top for restaurants in Broad Ripple.  I also
look forward to trying lunch and their takeout delicatessan offerings
soon... stay tuned!

 I Know it is Spicy, Just Go Get More Water!! Posted Monday, October 27, 2008 by Jason Gergely I was talking to one of my friends this weekend about our favorite places to eat in the Broad Ripple Area. He mentioned one that I haven’t been to in a while so we just decided to go for dinner. The place is called Yats and is located on the corner of 56th and college.

Yats is one of those places you can go anytime you want something out of the ordinary of ‘normal’ restaurants in Indy. The kind of food there is Cajun Creole. I know what you’re thinking… oh that means it is spicy… so it’s out of the question. I typically am not one for spicy, unless I am in the mood to consume a LOT of water with it. However, there are some less spicy options there. Plus if you don’t know what you want or get really anxious and uncomfortable with commitment, you can ask for samples of anything that is on the menu. But be warned… the menu does change a little from day to day. One day you might go in there and find something you really like and the next time you are in, they might not even be serving it. One of my favorite dishes there is the White Chili with Chicken, which is their own secret recipe. The other dish that I get when I go is the Chili Cheese Etouffee with Crawfish which is a little spicy, but if you like it spicier there are different kinds of sauce to put on it depending on your taste. The foods are delicious, but make sure you get extra bread because it complements the flavor of all the food very well (it costs a little extra, but it is worth it). After you order, you can go get your drink (free refills) and they will bring your food to you. However, make sure you grab a spoon and plenty of napkins because it can get messy if you sometimes suffer from poor hand-eye coordination like me.

The atmosphere is great. They have outdoor seating at all the locations that I know of, and is a great place for people watching. The people there are always friendly and are willing to answer any questions you have about the food. The price isn’t bad at all. You will get a lot of food and a drink with free refills for a very reasonable price. I wouldn’t recommend that you go there for a business meeting, but it is definitely a place to go if you just want to hang out. But remember it can get busy around 6 o’ clock each night so get in there a little early to beat the rush. There are several locations around Indianapolis, one on 56th and College, one on Mass Ave, one in Greenwood, one on 96th street. There are two more, but not in Indianapolis. They are in Chicago and in West Lafayette. So go ahead and check out their website and try out Yats at any of their locations.

 Lunch at the Hot Dog Place Posted Friday, October 24, 2008 by Jason Gergely This week Meghan (with an “H”) was in charge of making the decision for the weekly Compendium Blogware Marketing team lunch. If you want to check out Compendium and what we do you can Click Here .

This week Meghan chose a place that is just around the corner from our office called King David Dogs. It is a small place on Pennsylvania Street in the heart of Indianapolis. When you walk in you will see the menu posted right there on the wall. They have a full menu with foods ranging from a corn dog to a New York Dog with sauerkraut, mustard, and a New York style Onion Relish. They serve quarter pound hot dogs on a poppy seed bun (or if you want a pretzel bun) topped with almost anything you want. After leaving the restaurant Megan said she was “thoroughly stuff and did not anticipate being that way.” So when you go make sure you are hungry because the meals are larger than you might expect. She and Meghan ordered the Chicago Dog which had mustard, tomato, a sliced pickle, sweet relish, and onions. Both of them thought it was delicious. To add on, Megan said that it was a “fork and knife” meal and you’re definitely going to need napkins when you get your food, so stock up when you get your drink because it is kind of messy. Meghan also said that it was good for a cold day because all the food is “warm food”. Mikey ordered the New York Dog along with a cup of chili. He also requested some chili on his dog, but the hot dog guru behind the counter advised against it because it would be like a double chili bomb and he might regret it in his future. Mikey said he was glad that he took the guru’s advice. I decided to be adventurous and try the Pretzel dog. It was the same hot dog, but on a pretzel bun. I didn’t know what to put on top of it, so again I took the guru’s advice and put some chili and cheese on top and I did not regret it. However, it is very filling because the pretzel bun is a little larger than the normal bun and I had to take some of it home. As for the price, I think Meghan put it best when she said that it was very reasonably priced for all the food you get (your dog and fries or tater tots). It made the price even better when you order a drink, you get a nice souvenir cup with the King David Dogs logo on it to take back to work for a water cup. Also if you are a ice eater, the ice is light and fluffy, kind of like snow but when it is packed together a little (that is as well as I can describe it so just go get the ice).

The atmosphere was awesome because it gives you that hole-in-the-wall feeling when you walk in. It might not be good for a business meeting because the food might end up on your suit. However, it would be good if you are wanted to step out of your comfort zone and try someplace different. It would also be good for a date, but be sure to bring your gum because those onions will mess with your breath. It would be a great place to grab some lunch in downtown Indianapolis. So if you are looking for a place you can get a hot dog with pretty much whatever you want on it check out King David Dogs located at 15 North Pennsylvania.

 Great Indianapolis Lunch Restaruant: Au Bon Pain Posted Thursday, October 23, 2008 by Chris Baggott Au Bon Pain 
26 Monument Circle
Indianapolis, IN 46202
Phone: 317-226-9300

So in the beginning I was resistant to Au Bon Pain when they first opened on the Circle in Downtown Indianapolis.  I liked the South Bend Chocolate Factory and felt bad supporting a evil national competitor opening right next door. I also hate names that I can&apos;t pronounce very well...

So I was wrong. I probably frequent Au Bon Pain more that any other restaurant on the circle. An they are not evil.  If you look at the Au Bon Pain website, you will find that they are front and center with all of their nutrition information for every menu item. Health Magazine has named them one of the healthiest restaurants.  The food is really good and has a wide variety. Every day they have an assortment of soups, and as you can see from the video, they encourage sampleing.  (I&apos;m sure you could sneak in a lunch just on the samples) The also have lots of portion appropriate salds already made up, along with fresh wraps and half sandwiches.  I wouldn&apos;t call this a dinner restaurant, it&apos;s more like a delicatessen with great lunch food that&apos;s fast. They also have really good breakfast foods and for cookies&amp;muffins;it&apos;s one of the best bakeries in Indianapolis.

The people are friendly and I&apos;m happy to write a positive review of this great downtown Indianapolis restaurant.

 Seafood for lunch? Downtown Indianapolis Lunch Restaurant Posted Monday, October 20, 2008 by Chris Baggott 
McCormick&amp;Schmick;&apos;s Seafood Restaurant at the Corner of Illinois&amp;Market Streets at the base of the Downtown Hilton
(317) 631-9500

As an interested party to this Indianapolis Dining Guide, I&apos;m always on the lookout for something different. Typically during the day downtown I eat lunch as someplace fast.  The other day however, I found myself wanting to go someplace nice with my partner Ali and our big time Lawyer (patent work).  McCormick&amp;Schmick&apos;s was perfect.  The place has just the right mix of being busy with downtown workers (all wearing ties) yet still easy enough to get in and out of. We took a booth in the bar which is really nice looking with big booths and a great wooden bar.  They have two TV&apos;s up high and turned down low on ESPN so you could catch some highlights out of the corner of your eye...but not be intruded on.  

Indianapolis menu guide: they update the menu twice a day so you always know whats fresh&amp;available.

Although McCormick&amp;Schmick&apos;s is a great lunch spot, it&apos;s has really good seafood, terrific for dates, but perhaps most popular among the crowd here at Compendium Blogware it&apos;s the best happy hour downtown. I wouldn&apos;t call it a place for Indianapolis nightlife, but what is so appealing is the great bar and the terrific drinks. Happy hour is fun and crowded partly because of the great menu .  Everything from fish tacos ( for the mexican food lover ) to one of the best Hamburgers in Indianapolis all for like....$1.95 each.  Great prices for great food.  All in all, a place I would highly recommend. See the Video for a sense of the Lunchtime ambiance...

 A little piece of Pennsylvania Posted Friday, October 17, 2008 by Jason Gergely So this week was my choice in where the Marketing Staff at Compendium would be going for lunch. You can check out Compendium Blogware by Clicking Here .

This week I decided to go back to the cornucopia that is the City Market and try out this place called Philadelphia Steak&amp;Cheese. Joined by Monica this time, we agreed that it was a good place to eat, but some felt like the food needed something else. We all ordered Philly Cheese Steaks, but there were also burgers on the menu along with breakfast foods that I believe are only served in the morning. Mikey and Monica felt that the sandwiches could have used more cheese. Monica also thought that the meat tasted like it was re-heated beef, which I guess has a different taste. She also said that the “seasoned fries” would be better if they had the peel on and they need to have lots more seasoning. Mikey mentioned, “The next time I go, I might opt for one for the burgers that I didn’t see until I got up to the counter.”  Meghan said that her sandwich and food was delicious. She had never had a Philly Cheese Steak before and doesn’t have anything to compare it to, but “for the first time it was really, really good and I want to go back.” As for the boss lady, Megan , she really enjoyed her Philly experience. She said that her food was fresh and hot, but could have used more seasoning and cheese. Megan mentioned that it was not as greasy as expected and she really liked the wheat bun (isn’t all wheat bread just wheat bread?). And since it was Boss’s day, we all pitched in for her meal and she loved “that my wonderful team paid for my lunch.” As for my meal, I felt like it was great. I had gone once before last spring, and it was just as good as I remembered. And just like everyone else, I wish there was a little bit more cheese on the sandwich, but overall I thought it was great.

Now the atmosphere of the whole lunch is something we all agree on. Meghan said, “As always, the atmosphere was excellent.” She also felt that the guys behind the counter brought Philadelphia to Indianapolis. Mikey thought the staff was awesome and if you speak even a little Spanish, there is a free lesson at the end of the line. The man there speaks Spanglish and as Mikey found out, if you speak even a little Spanish to him, he will talk in only Spanish. So who-ever said you can’t learn at a fast food restaurant, you can tell them they are wrong. Monica thought the service was very efficient and well organized. The owner really knows how to make a quick, good Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. However, don’t be polite to the cashier (who I think is a real Philadelphian) because he gets thrown off and doesn’t know how to respond. When I gave him my money, I said thank you (just like my mom taught me to do) and the cashier said, “Why are you all being some polite to me, I work in the fast food business, you’re supposed to abuse me.” But I think he was kidding…. a little.

So if you are in the mood for a quick taste of Philadelphia, you don’t have to worry about driving out there and the price of gas. Just cruise over to the City Market located at 222 East Market Street, right in downtown Indianapolis and get your free Spanish lesson along with a good sandwich. If you want to check out was else the City Market as to offer you can Click Here .

 My shirt smells like Cuban! Posted Friday, October 10, 2008 by Jason Gergely This week, we put trust in Mikey to choose where the Marketing Team here at Compendium went to lunch. You can check out Compendium Blogware’s website by Clicking Here .


A small Cuban restaurant on Market Street, next to the Capital building is where we spent our lunchtime today. The place is called Tata’s Cuban Cafe. If you are in the mood for some authentic Cuban, this is the place to go. The menu isn’t too confusing, with 12 dishes (6 sandwiches and 6 entrees), you won’t feel overwhelmed while looking through it. Megan and I both got the Sandwich Cubano El Quaso, which has some pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard, and pickles all in a conglomeration, joined by being hot pressed on a Cuban bun. Megan and I both agree that is was very good, but could have used more condiments. She said it was “perfectly pressed” and she would defiantly go back to get the same sandwich, but would also like to try the Shrimp Varadero. The other Meghan ordered the Pan con Bistec Santa Palabra which is a thin grilled top sirloin that is marinated in citrus juice along with an abundance of grilled onions, all on pressed bread. She thought it was a lot of food for a great price. She also said it was very good and it “Satisfied my Cuban craving.” However, it was a messy sandwich, with lots of onions but be prepared to use lots of napkins. Meghan also mentioned that the service was great, very nice and accommodating. Also, the sandwiches are much larger than you expect so come hungry, or be prepared to take some home with you for left-overs. Mickey however decided to get an entrée. He ordered the Arroz Amarillo cienfuego. It consisted of yellow rice, with some herbs and corn along with grilled chicken and sweet plantains. He said that he really liked it and it “whisked me away to another place.” Mickey also mentioned that “the rice tasted really good... and so did the chicken.” So apparently he enjoyed it. He also mentioned something about wanting to go there for his next birthday party. So interpret that as you wish.

About the atmosphere, Megan felt it was a quaint place to grab lunch but defiantly allow yourself an hour if you can. If you can’t they also do carry-out, so that might be another option if you are limited on time. They have a patio outside with a few tables and chairs that is a great place to enjoy the day and eat some Cuban food. I must warn you that if you want to sit and eat, you better get there a little before noon because once 12:15 hits, it will fill up quick and you might find yourself without a table. Also, if you like the aroma of Cuban food, that is great because you will be sporting a new scent of Cuban cuisine for the rest of the day. So if you want to check out Tata’s Cuban Café it is located at 137 West Market Street here in Indianapolis. If you want to check out their website Click Here .
