 do you tip the carhops at sonic? 
 
i’ve been working at sonic for around four months. i know that doesn’t sound like a long period of time. but in my personal opinion it is after you work at least eight hour shifts everyday as a sixteen year old. we never have breaks or even get to sit down. we are constantly on our feets.

i think ALL customers should tip the carhop. customers assume that all carhops do is bring the food out. but in reality, that’s totally wrong. at least at my sonic. i have to take the orders, make the drinks/ice cream, bag the food, and finally bring out the food. that’s basically everything. it isn’t as easy as it seems mostly when you’re short handed or when it’s crazy like during happy hour. we should get tips. we get little money as it is. if you’re not going to tip a dollar or two. at least let us keep the change. (as in the coins.) never give us a dollar and ask for fifty cents back. that’s just damn cheap. especially tip if your order a bunch of ice cream because we do have to make all of them. and it gets messyyyy!

all i wanted to say is that you should tip the car hops. we deserve it. we walk all day long in the hot blaring sun, the rain, and the cold.

and if you don’t tip, i would just like to know why you don’t.

i think everyone should tip unless the carhop is just plain out rude or doesn’t look like they are trying their very best.
i get an hour only because i’ve been working there than all of the carhops. the rest only get .85 an hour.

as of july 24th since min. wage went up. we get .55 an hour if we do drive through or whatever.

but if you were hired after july 24th, you only get .13 an hour.

that means we do rely on tips too. it’s just like a waiter’s job!

nonetheless, we deserve tips as long as we provide customers with decent service and a good attitude.

I tip them a $1 and if you are not getting one break, you could complain to OSHA because you are supposed to get a break.

I used to be at odds with myself over whether I should tip carhops, but I do now, at least $1 for every $5 of my order, rounding up. Even though I’ve never been a server or carhop, I have a great respect for them–the good ones at least. Aside from the work, you also deserve it for having to put up with hard-to-please customers or folks that act like they don’t respect you.

If I have the money I’ll tip them $5 but if not I’ll just let them keep all the change xD

How much do you get paid per hour as a carhop? Minimum wage is $6.55 per hour, however tipped employees, such as restaurant servers, only have to be paid $2.13 per hour. Since it is assumed that the tips will bring the employees hourly wage equal to at least minimum wage. Also at many Sonics, you can pay with a debit, credit or Sonic Card and when you pay this way it does not allow you to add a tip, therefore Sonic corporate must not feel that their employees need tipped (this is a personal opinion ask Sonic their opinion by going to http://www.sonic.com ). I do sometimes tip, but I think it is up to you and the level of service you recieve!

We don’t have Sonics here yet but I always tip carhops-if I have a to go order I tell them to keep the change.

I honestly didn’t know carhops were supposed to be tipped. I figured if the person makes normal hourly pay, like at every other fast food restaurant, you aren’t obligated to leave a tip. I have never gotten EXCEPTIONAL service there that went above and beyond the minimum requirements of their job. It shouldn’t be an obligation to have to tip a fast food worker (it’s not a real sit-down restaurant and you’re not technically waiting on them), but if one is really nice and doesn’t cop a serious attitude when I ask for a packet of ketchup for my french fries, I’ll leave a dollar or whatever change I have.

On more than one occasion, I’ve gotten some carhops who&quot;forget&quot;to bring change when they bring the food out and I pay, then somehow also&quot;forget&quot;to bring my change out later. I think that’s pretty lame and I can’t help but feel they do it on purpose (seeing as it’s happened A LOT!), but if they want that 75 cents bad enough, I guess they can have it.

yes , but I also pay with a debit card, and I do not always have extra change on me,
 Samantha says: January 31, 2011 at 12:25 pm 
you tip waitresses at a restaurant because they make like 2.50 an hour (LESS than minimum wage) because they live off the tips. You tip the pizza guy because he spends his gas money to take the food to your house. YOU on the other hand, are working a regular job like the rest of us, making atleast minimum wage. Get used to it
 Jessica says: January 31, 2011 at 12:25 pm 
depends on your attitude, when you come out expecting a tip, with a bad attitude, im not tipping you. on most accounts, i tip.
 Matthew N says: January 31, 2011 at 12:25 pm 
I let the car hops keep the change.

I agree with you completely.
and for all of you who say we don’t deserve it because we make minimum wage, that isn’t always true. I make $5.85/hr and others only make $4/hr.
also you should definitely tip those who skate, because also contrary to popular belief, they don’t always earn extra.

I agree that we deserve at least rounded tips from all customers. The people that frustrate me the most are the ones that park at the furthest spots and can’t even manage to swipe their credit card at the right time. Meanwhile you are carrying out there $20+ dollar meal with 5, 6, or 7 drinks. Once reading their entire order and giving them all the food, you have to go back inside to swipe the card and bring it back to them. Then they don’t give you a tip!!!

Also, there is a whole lot more to being a carhop than just taking out the food. At my sonic, you have to get the board and bag food. Other people are assigned to drinks.

However, about half the time you work you are the one assigned to drinks and half the time you carhop. Making drinks/ice cream for, in my case, minimum wage really sucks. Especially since I generally only work weekends. That means I fountain/ice cream from 12 to 9 on saturday with minimal breaks(when not busy).

Considering how many other jobs there are out there where people make significantly more than minimum wage for doing next to nothing, Sonic carhops are definitely worthy of tips.
