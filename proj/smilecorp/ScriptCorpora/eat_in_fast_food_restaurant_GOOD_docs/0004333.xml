 Fast Diet Foods

The Good Housekeeping website claims that you can have fast food and stay on your diet as long as you follow what is called the 3-4-5 program that includes a 300 calorie breakfast, 400 calorie lunch, 500 calorie dinner and snacks that total 300 calories. The key is in your menu selection. Count every calorie you eat, including those in the condiments. The MayoClinic.com website even claims that eating fast food occasionally has its place in a healthy diet as long as you are careful with choices.
 
Burgers and Sandwiches

Dieters can order burgers and sandwiches at fast food restaurants without going over their daily calorie allowance. When you order a burger at a fast food restaurant, MayoClinic.com recommends choosing a children&apos;s size portion that contains less than half the calories of a double-patty burger. Good Housekeeping claims that a 6-inch sub sandwich with lean meat and fresh vegetables can keep you in your ideal calorie range, as long as you limit fatty additions such as oil, mayonnaise and cheese.
 
Side Dishes

Skip the French fries, advises MayoClinic.com, and opt for a salad, fruit bowl, baked potato or yogurt. Not only will you skip the fat from frying, you&apos;ll have the advantage of the nutrients from the healthier side dish choices. When you order a healthy side dish, be careful not to sabotage your diet by adding high fat dressings, sauces and toppings.
 
Pizza

Pizza can be a healthy choice for dieters as long as you are careful in what you order claims Good Housekeeping. Choose thin crust rather than medium or thick crust to save some calories and have more flavor per bite. Avoid high-fat meat toppings such as sausage or pepperoni. Instead, select as many vegetables as you want. Not only are veggies low in calories, you&apos;ll have a much more nutritious meal.
 
Salad

Many of the fast food restaurants offer salads. Order a salad with grilled meat, fish or vegetables rather than fried. Use low-fat or fat-free dressing to save calories. Avoid ordering salads in fried tortilla shells that can pack on many more calories than you need in one meal. According to MayoClinic.com, most of the fast food restaurants offer salads that contain approximately 300 calories.
 
Beverages

Regular large sodas contain as many as 300 calories each. When ordering a drink at a fast food restaurant, select diet sodas. If you are also on a sodium-restricted diet, choose unsweetened tea or water. Avoid the shakes or other frozen drinks because they can contain more calories than the rest of the meal combined.
