I hadn&apos;t been here before but since I was heading to an event at City Bar&amp;didn&apos;t want to spend a ton of money on dinner, I decided to stop in here after recently learning that they don&apos;t just sell soup.  They also have &quot;create your own&quot; salads&amp;I found that my meal with water was cheaper than at the specialty salad places.

Another plus is they have honey mustard dressing.  Seems to be more value for your buck here.  The location itself is a little small but there was sufficient seating when I came in.

I&apos;ve not had the soup but with so many different varieties, maybe I&apos;ll be motivated to try one sometime.  I also liked getting the free oyster crackers with my order.  Staff was also polite&amp;reasonably friendly.  I think this will be my go to for dinner when I have events at City Bar&amp;don&apos;t have time or inclination to go someplace fancy.

All Hale the soup genius behind this chain! Hale&amp;Hearty is my go-to lunch spot, especially during the cold winter months. I&apos;m a huge soup person. My favorites are the jambalaya, clam chowders, chicken pot pie, and tons of others. I love that the soups change daily and they have a new sandwich every month. It keeps things changing so I can always try new things. They also carry salad if you&apos;re into leafy greens. I&apos;ve only had one thing I wasn&apos;t a fan of here in the many many many times I take out. Its hard to go wrong when they have so many choices and they let you try the soup before you buy.

This location tends to be hellish during lunch because of the swarms of people in the tiny narrow storefront. They have a tiny amount of seating in the back and the cashiers move quickly, but try not to be offended if you get shoved around a bit. They also only keep hours consistent with the 9-5pm crowd, so they&apos;re not a good dinner option.

(2.50 stars)  There are some great soup lunches to be had in Manhattan.  Few choices are more warming, comforting or flat-out delicious than a great bowl of soup.  IMRHO, the Soup Spot and Soup Cart (a few blocks north) at bargain prices, and famous Soup Man make much better soup and offer better service.  Hale and Hearty offer two things which the others don&apos;t.

First, the variety here is amazing.  There are soup varieties offer here which expand the international food parameters and challenge contemporary culinary bounds.  Although a few taste remarkably similar, those which I&apos;ve tasted have been good.

Next, and this should not be minimized, Hale and Hearty offers tables and chairs.

You&apos;ll find a pricing system of flavors and sizes which requires 20/20 vision to read.  Their prices are in the higher range for what is offered, but still reasonable when viewed among lunchtime options in Midtown.  Soups are also available with half- or full-sized sandwiches, and I&apos;m not a huge fan of their sandwiches.  Soup-and-salad combos are also sold.

I am excited to find such a healthy change!  I had no idea it existed until I walked by on my most recent trip to NY.

I got the Winter Dumpling Soup, and it was fantastic.  It is so difficult to find soups that are really filling without having a cream base.  I love soups with a squash base!  It taste delicious, and doesn&apos;t sit in your stomach the way that a cream-based soup does.  Yum!

I also got a sandwich with mozzarella, tomato, avocado and a little lemon zest, a combination I wouldn&apos;t have really thought of myself, but was surprisingly delicious!

The whole ordering process was a little bit rushed, but what can you expect in a fast food restaurant at lunch time on a week day?  The healthy options and clean running lines more than made up for any confusion that was caused by the hustle and bustle of the city life.  Just to name a couple delicious healthy bites: baked veggie chips, Gus&apos; Grown Up Soda (less sugar, all natural!)

Definitely recommend stopping in for a quick bite while exploring the city!

One of the better chains out there!  Came here before a show one night for a quick bite and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

Had some chicken curry soup and the balsamic chicken sandwich.  Both seemed very fresh even at that late hour.

It was tight quarters but I didn&apos;t expect to have much room in there.

I think we can all agree that lunch is no joking matter. It can make or break your afternoon, and often it&apos;s the one thing you can look forward to during your work day. So when you find a place that is consistently amazing, sometimes all you can do to show your appreciation is to sing a song via Yelp:

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin&apos; one of these days their soup will set my faith astride
But then I spent so many lunches
Eating Hale&amp;Hearty soups
And I grew strong!
Hale&amp;Hearty was perfect all along!
So I go back
Day after day
All of their soups are great
And even salad takes the cake
I should have never doubted you
I should have written that 5 star review
But now I&apos;m revived! I&apos;m so revived!

Wooo..that was fun. Seriously, you have to justify your $6-7/day somehow, right?

My recommendations: Moroccan Chicken, Curried Cauliflower&amp;Chickpea, White Tuscan Bean, Spinach Mushroom&amp;Leak, Chicken Noodle, Vegetarian Split Pea, pretty much everything on their menu. And you can check the website to see which soups any location is offering on that particular day. They&apos;ve totally indoctrinated me.

This is the upper end of the many soup places in Manhattan.  I had the mixed paella soup that was very fresh and came with a reasonable price tag.  I really like this place but it is a little too touristy, and certainly not a place for foodies.

As far as this particular chain goes, you can&apos;t go terribly wrong. I stopped in here around 5:30/6:00 pm for a quick bite before doing a practice LSAT test at the library across the street, and it served my purposes nicely.

Being that I was right next to Bryant Park and the NYPL (e.g. tourist central), I was looking for something relatively inexpensive and fast. This Hale&amp;Hearty location gave me the fast part, but it was a tad expensive for what I got.

Went with a chicken caesar salad sandwich (half) and picked up one of their pre-packaged brownies, and it came out to a little under $7. The half sandwich was somewhere around $4 or $5 so that was an expensive little dessert! A whole sandwich starts out around $7ish, and I&apos;ll definitely say that in general they&apos;re a little skimpy with the fillings. It&apos;s a good thing my body thrives on carbs with the mostly bread sandwich I was consuming.  Why is it that I can never find a healthy looking sandwich (tip: &quot;healthy&quot; in this context means loaded with meat, cheese, etc.) at any place but a dingy looking deli on the corner? And why are those delis far cheaper than these chains?

Mini-diatribe on sandwich/price inequities aside, I got what I needed at the time, but it&apos;s more expensive than it should be and they skimp a little bit on their sandwiches.

It&apos;s hard to write reviews for chain restaurants/stores...cause it all boils down to customer service.

I&apos;ve been here twice for soup...their soups are good and you can ask for samples, even though the girl gave me such a little portion and looked at me like I was too cheap to actually order something. That cost them that 4th star. It gets crazy busy at lunch time, so you better know what you want, get in and get out. It&apos;s a good location because it&apos;s right across from Bryant Park and in the midst of many office buildings.

Tip-bits:

Single unisex bathroom to the back L corner
Poor cellphone reception...for me (AT&amp;T) in store
Get their soup loyalty card...ask for it, they don&apos;t always offer it.
Lunch combos- soup and sandwich?

I&apos;ve revised my views of this Hale&amp;Hearty location.  Though it gets quite full during the lunch hour, service for soup&amp;a sandwich is insanely fast.  And no matter what the line situation, they never give me attitude for asking for a sample of a new-to-me soup.  After watching the salad line grow exponentially, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever get one of those here during midtown&apos;s feeding frenzy.

Extra points for being next to Bryant Park... greatest place to ever have a soup&amp;sandwich by yourself.

Finally, June&apos;s monthly soup is out of this world good - cream of tomato with chicken and orzo.

The line at this place is insane and there aren&apos;t enough tables. Usually the tables aren&apos;t particularly clean...

So... how is the famous soup? Well, I have a theory about Hale&amp;Hearty. I honestly believe that there is a ton of hidden lard in that soup. I used to eat it fairly regularly and found I was gaining weight (no joke). I stopped and... lost weight. I don&apos;t care what that calorie counter says. There is something awry at Hale&amp;Hearty.

At this location, across from Bryant Park, there are so many better places to eat (&apos;Wichcraft, even the Cosi). Try one.

I love this place. Love that you can sample the soups. Love the 10 soups and 1 free. Love the cookies. Love the fresh lemonade. Love that everything has calories listed. My favorite soups are the chicken pot pie and the one with mashed potato. It&apos;s literally mashed potatoes in soup form..... How do they do that? This is my stop spot before class.

The Soup Nazi can kiss my soup loving ass.

Hale&amp;Hearty Soups is pretty damn good. My particular favorite is the green and yellow split pea. Thick blend of green and yellow split peas with double smoked bacon.

Let&apos;s face it...bacon=better. If it were socially acceptable I would bathe in bacon. But I think I might lose my friends, job and wife if I smelt of cooked piggy.

Other favorites at Hale&amp;Hearty include smoked turkey corn chowder, shrimp bisque and chicken vegetable with couscous or noodles.

They have about 5 regular soups, which are available all the time. Then they offer about 10-15 specialty soups that change on a daily basis.

Someone wrote in a previous review about this place that the people were rude and snotty. Well then stay out and leave more soup for ol&apos; Andy boy. No soup for you!!!!

I had finished a horrible horrible legal proceeding and another attorney and I were kinda hungry.  We stopped in.  What did we do?  Eat soup of course!  There were many flavors and we were allowed to sample.  I settled for the ginger butternut squash soup.  It was decent.  Servers were quite helpful and were amazing to customers who probably deserved to be disrespected if you believe that you &quot;do unto others...&quot;

I met two nice strangers, one woman who was rather obsessed with Elie Manning and was going to see him.  She showed us pictures and used a calendar from last year to tell where he was and when.  I was thinking STALKER...but she was nice...

The second stranger was an actress from Georgia...very pretty but her discussion with the second attorney led to such amazing preconceptions as &quot;I know you aren&apos;t a casting agent so you can&apos;t do anything for me&quot; and other amazing remarks.    She said she was off to the movies.  Eventually she left, probably to find some casting agent.

Good soup, dont talk to strangers...

I frequently stop into Hale&amp;Hearty to pick up a &quot;quick lunch&quot;.  &quot;Quick&quot; being the operative word.

Due to slim pickings of general and reasonably priced restaurants in the Bryant Park area compared to Times Square, Grand Central or Rockefeller Center, the establishments around Bryant Park are subject to the subject to be busy at peak times and dead the rest of the day.  This H&amp;H location is swarming like a hive of bees at lunchtime.  So go early or don&apos;t go.  This location is very small and there are about 10 or 15 seats.  Its so small that when you&apos;re ordering soup your directly on top of the two tables closest to the register.  This is completely inappropriate.  If you looking for a place to unwind during lunch, this H&amp;H is not the place.  During nice weather, you&apos;re better off going across the street to Bryant Park.

The lines...oh man.  The lines can be so long that they intertwine and you often have to ask the person in front of you, &quot;which line are you in?  Soup or Salad?&quot;  On many occasions, the salad line snakes out the door or blocks it.

The staff is friendly but can appear short as they are trying their best to quickly service people and get them out the door.

Soups are a bit expensive but worth it in my book.  There are about 30 soups on their menu.  Every day the soup selection changes.  Visit the H&amp;H website and vote for you favorite soup(s) as well as set yourself up to receive and email notifications when (one of) your favorite soup(s) is on the menu. My suggestion is that you try your soup selection before buying, even if its one of your favorites or something you&apos;ve bought before.

Their salads are standard with the usual suspects as toppings unfortunately their salad dressings are Gawd awful!  I&apos;ve tried three or four dressings and each time they&apos;ve ruined my perfectly built salad!

I&apos;ve never tried the sandwiches or pre-made salads, as the sandwiches look skimpy and over priced and pre made salads look unappealing.

Listed below are my favorite soups.  Give them a try.

Chicken&amp;Sausage Jambalaya
Chicken and Corn Bisque
Chicken Marsala with Wild Mushrooms
Chicken Pot Pie
Chicken, Mushroom and Wild Rice
Curried Shrimp and Roasted Corn Bisque

Make sure to get your bean or green card stamped with each purchase.  10 stamps entitle you to a free soup or salad.

This location does have delivery, I&apos;ve never used the service but others I know have and say its slow and to avoid using it.

For a wide selection of nice, warm, relatively inexpensive, flavorful and filling soups, this is a good bet for lunch.  I had some vegetarian split pea soup.  My friend had a chili lentil soup.  Service was fine (no &quot;soup nazis&quot; here)!

The decor of lentils and beans in plastic on the tables and walls was an interesting touch.

Vegetarians and vegans will find at least a couple of soups here.  The soups are labeled &quot;vegetarian&quot; and &quot;dairy-free.&quot;  That&apos;s great!  Gluten-free is not too difficult, just opt out of the side of bread and the minestrone for sure!

If I its cold, I will do either one of two things, drink a few ice cold beers (fight fire with fire approach) or self-indulge in a chunky steamy soup.

Obviously the pending responsibilities and time of day are major variables in deciding my strategy of combat.

For the latter, Hale and Hearty is a reliable combatant, armed with a variety of flavors for every palette and an efficiency in its ordering process that would make any military operation shrivel in embarrassment.

It has to be said, although the line moves like Swedish clockwork you do get the occasional stray who exceed their soup sampler privileges, but then again in my eyes, even one is one too many...

What is a girl to do when it&apos;s 10 degrees out and they find themselves in Midtown, with a long walk ahead of them?
Why, get soup, of course.
Unfortuantley, half of midtown had the same idea as me, and the line was ... quite literally...out the door.
Still, nothing warms the soul like turkey lentil soup, and when it comes with a small salad and the classic hale&amp;hearty vinegrette AND 7-grain bread, all the better.
Yes, I overspent on my lunch...but...I&apos;d do it again in a second to feel that liquid warmth scorching down my throat.

To my side pieces Hale&amp;Hearty,

I will never betray you and your soups. Soupman can not touch your soupy skills.

your yukon gold four cheese creation makes my heart sing

your creamy asparagus leek potato makes me wanna hug a homeless person

I never knew (soupy) love until I found you.

You will always be my number 2.

Well there&apos;s no doubt about it- its pretty damn good soup and a wide variety of flavors.  But its soup-  soup in and of itself is not a very expensive product, so paying fairly steep, sandiwch like prices for soup here- a takeout place that&apos;s not a gourmet restaurant kills the flavor somewhat.

That being said, focusing on the product, they have an excellent Chicken Marsala soup, very good chilis, and the ethnic soups like the Moroccan Chicken are also quite good.  They let you try a sip of the soup before eating, so if something sounds intriguing by all means try it.

They also offer sandwiches and $7.50 half sandwich/soup deal that&apos;s not all that filling.  The sandwiches, though pre-made, actually taste pretty damn good and fresh and there&apos;s enough unique stuff and a good enough variety to make them worthwile.

This location can be a madhouse around lunchime and isn&apos;t ver big, so visit on slightly off hours to avoid the rush.

I am a soup whore, yes, I admit that soupy sluttiness is only a requirement for when NYC weather turns chilly.

I had to do my asian mommy bit and ask for lots of soup samples which the staff so patiently helped with.  One of the first tastes was this yucky Rhode Island Clam Chowder..it was red and bacony...and I have nothing against the pig, but it kind of overpowered the rest of the flavor. I finally hit on the Chicken and Corn bisque...OMG, so chunky and full of corn goodness! Just enough sweet and savory to make the chicken pieces stand out.

Ahh...when I&apos;m back in my Bay Area crib, I shall miss you my Hale&amp;Hearty Brothel T_T.

I love soup. I love making it and eating it. And I&apos;m glad I stumbled upon this place while looking for a Starbucks.

The selection was good, I had the sweet potato chicken chowder (I ordered a small.. wish I got a medium, but I was full from a small.) They also had a chicken curry soup and a chicken marsala, both sound amazing.

I want to go back and try each soup they have! The sandwiches looked decent, as well.. but I&apos;d opt for soup and the free water.

Seats are limited, but it was a nice day out.. so we decided to eat in the park and mingle with people on their lunch breaks.

They also have vegetarian options!

The employees at Hale and Hearty are extremely rude.  I went there for the first time last week.  I didn&apos;t know that there was a line for soups and a separate line for salads.  I went directly to the cashier.  She rudely commented that I needed to go into the soup line.  She then proceeded to roll her eyes towards her coworkers.

I felt completely disrespected.  The service was awful!  They were VERY RUDE!

I proceeded to leave without making a purchase.  If the food is anything like the service, I don&apos;t know how it can survive this recession.

Albert Einstein once said &quot;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&quot;. Think about this quote for a second and ask yourself, does this sound like your lunch routine?

Well if you answered, YES, then you probably work in midtown.

I despise the options I have around me during my little pocket of freedom I call lunchbreak. I eat the same bland turkey sandwiches, from the same deli with a different name and location. A smorgasbord of sandwiches, salad bars, burritos, pastas, buffets, sushi, and Mongolian grills. While the list might seem diverse, trust me, it isn&apos;t.

Enter Hale&amp;Hearty.
Does this place break the mold I so desperately seek to escape during my lunch hour?...well... yes, but being the fastest rabbit in a land full of turkeys is nothing to be proud of ( that&apos;s assuming turkeys are slow, im not entirely sure?). It doesn&apos;t quench my thirst for a decent lunch, but it does however make things bearable.

With that said, I hold a special place in my heart for Hale&amp;Hearty. It&apos;s Curried Chicken Chowder Soup breaks up the monotony of my lunches and adds a splash of color to my continuous grays. Even if that color is dull and muted, its something until I make it home for a proper meal.

God bless you Curried Chicken Chowder, god bless you.

Let me preface this by offering one little tidbit of advice: don&apos;t expect to get a good back massage from a one armed retarded hooker.

That is by long way of saying that you can&apos;t expect a restaurant to be very good at something it doesn&apos;t necessarily do. Hale and Hearty makes pretty good soup--three, maybe four star soup--but it doesn&apos;t make a good chili.

It doesn&apos;t make a good chili because (wait for it) chili is not soup. Its consistency is different, its flavors richer, more surprising. Sure, they are both liquid-based slow cooked stew-like meals, but chili is an art. It is a special middle child that need lots of understand to come into its own.

The chili at Hale and Hearty looked like diahrria. It didn&apos;t taste much better either. But I judge them a little too harshly.

After all, even a one-armed hooker has her talents.

Hale and Hearty makes a great corn chowder soup and that is no small thing. The good folk behind the counter, while prone to acting as if you aren&apos;t standing there waiting to order lunch, dish out some surprising soups. Sadly the sandwiches are about as lackluster as the chili. I would recommend that you go across the park after picking up your soup a H&amp;H to Pax for a sandwich.

The salads and sandwiches here are pretty good and I appreciate that they sell half sandwiches, but the salad-makers are disorganized, bicker amongst themselves, and slow as molasses.

Will have to try once more to see what all the hype is about ..

I was in the mood for soup and found Hale and Hearty nearby .. there is a huge selection of soups but I decided to sample only one since it was a busy lunch hour and I didn&apos;t want to hold up the line sampling everything ..

I tried the chicken/sausage/seafood paella, and it tasted no different than the chicken/sausage gumbo I get from Campbell&apos;s Chunky canned soup ..

I went with the cajun shrimp bisque, which is what the guy ahead of me had ordered, as it looked thick, creamy, and delicious .. and it was delicious ... the soup itself .. the shrimp was horrible ... there was a ton of shrimp but it was way overcooked .. maybe shrimp isn&apos;t the best thing to add in soup?

Next time I&apos;ll have to try the chili mac and cheese .. sounds so deliciously bad for you..

Went in here at lunch time looking to see what the fuzz is all about - sometimes there are lines outside the door. Had my mind set on the ubiquitous chicken noodle soup. First of all, they let you choose between noodles or couscous  and they put it in with the &quot;chicken vegetable&quot; broth.

Gotta say it tasted a-ok. I thought it had a lot of oil, I could see it reflecting in the surface! You can have your choice of crackers, 7-grain or another kind of bread. Picked the 7-grain and it was pretty good. You don&apos;t really need to order the &quot;half-sandwich&quot; deal.

I&apos;ll give it a couple more tries.

I noticed a very unique soup concoction on the Hale and Hearty chalk board today....Black Lentil and Smoked Turkey. Perhaps you Professional Yelpers have tried this myriad of ingredients with a sludge-like appearance before, but it was a first time for me.

If you can get to Hale and Hearty on 42nd by Bryant Park today, do it. The Black Lentil and Smoked Turkey was DA BOMB! Also, an effcient use of the smoked turkey they probably had left over from the salad creation station. When you heat that day old turkey up, it tastes just fine!

Their soups won&apos;t blow you away, but they are good. Pretty much anywhere you can get a good lunch in Manhattan for under five dollars is A-OK by me! Just one thing is annoying me however. I love broccoli and cheddar soup with a passion, and although this is listed on their official menu, it&apos;s never actually been one of the soups available any of the four or five times I&apos;ve been here!! What gives?? I want my broccoli and cheddar!!!

Decent soup, but nothing to write home about. Good as an afternoon snack to tide you over, but not really much of a meal on its own. The bread is tasty, and it is nice that you can sample the soups before committing, since they have so many choices. For the best selection, go early - they&apos;ve usually run out of a few soups by around 6 pm.

The soup here is very tasty.  If you can&apos;t choose between the various types ask to try one and they will give you a taste size cup to sample.  On a warm day, take your soup to go and enjoy it in Bryant Park.

There is a medium array of soups to select from.  Considering that I am new to the neighborhood, I have only been at this establishment two times.  Thus, I have only tried the Moroccan Chicken and Maryland Crab soups.  Moroccan Chicken is a MUST for any fans of  Middle Eastern Cuisine!  For the right portion, I suggest the medium with your choice of bread or crackers.

The food is fine and you can walk to Byrant Park to sit and enjoy your meal. They offer sandwiches, soups and salads. But for something different walk over to Say Cheese.

You haven&apos;t smelled good soup until you&apos;ve been in this eatery. It&apos;s so warm and inviting, you won&apos;t even know what to do with yourself. Try the curry chicken chowder if you&apos;re feeling ethnic, or stick to a really good chicken noodle soup. You&apos;ll never be disappointed.
