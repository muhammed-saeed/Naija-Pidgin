Any one got stories of extremely cheap people?
 There are people at my local gym that use the paper towels for slippers and steal the soap.

 An old friend of mine used to tell me stories about this guy she met in college several years ago. She said that he was a really nice guy and they became fairly good friends, but he was about the cheapest person she had ever met. I guess he admitted to her one day after he had drank too much that he would wear his underwear for two days in a row. The first day he would wear them right-side out, then he would turn them inside out come the second day. When she told him how gross she thought that was, he responded with,&quot;hey, I&apos;m a college student on a budget. I need to worry about tuition and book fees, not how much it&apos;s going to cost me at the laundromat.&quot;

One day she went to visit him in his dorm and had brought a bag of McDonald&apos;s with food for both of them. After they had finished their food and she tried to throw the bag in the trash, he yelled at her not to throw the bag away because it had ketchup packets in it. He dug the ketchup packets out of the trash, and my friend proceeded to watch as he opened each individual packet to transfer them to a ketchup bottle he kept in his mini-fridge. He told her that you never knew when you&apos;d run out of ketchup, so whenever he was in a fast-food restaurant he always grabbed handfuls, just in case.

She told me that he was also guilty of buying two-ply paper towels and toilet paper, so he could get twice the use out of them when he separated them. Whenever he stayed in hotels he would take not only the complimentary soaps and shampoos, but the towels and pillows as well. Whenever he started getting low on milk, he would add some water to it, to make it stretch longer. He said it didn&apos;t taste much different than skim milk.

Anything that came in a container that could possibly be reused, this guy saved. I guess he had boxes of margarine and sour cream tubs that he would use as bowls, jars of jelly and salsa that he would use as drinking glasses, and he would keep and wash/rewash all of the sporks and plasticware he would use when he ate in fast-food restaurants.

I didn&apos;t personally know the guy, but he&apos;s probably the cheapest person I have heard stories about.

 I know someone who&apos;ll drive a few miles out of his way to get a carton of milk, say, for a few cents cheaper. If we ever have dinner together, he&apos;s the only one who drinks the free tap water rather than buying a drink. In a pub he will not even spend the money for a coke or some other fizzy drink, and gets tea instead.

 The cheapest man I ever knew was the landlord when I was a teenager. The kitchen tap started leaking and my dad called him. He came up with a handful of rubber washers in his hand. None of them fitted so he pulled a penknife and started CARVING one to make it fit. When he left, the tap was leaking more than before. I went to the hardware store, and for a quarter, I got a bag of a dozen tap washers that fitted just fine.

 My grandmother used to use jars for drinking glasses and all her mismatched bowls were cracked and chipped my mom said they were the same ones she grew up with. She was very rich by the way.
