With Ohio’s minimum wage tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), workers covered under it will begin earning $7.70 an hour Sunday.

That is a 30-cent-per-hour increase for thousands of area residents over the $7.40 hourly minimum of 2011.

Brandon Zerkle, a 17-year-old West Branch High School junior, said he logs about 16 hours a week at his job at a McDonald’s restaurant in Alliance.

“I knew the wage was going up this month. It’s going to help with gas going up, for sure,”he said.

For GlenOak High School senior Ashley Andrews, whose part-time job is at Taco Bell, the hourly increase will help pay her cellphone and car insurance bills as well as buy gasoline.

The 18-year-old said she averages 10 to 15 hours weekly at the fast-food restaurant.

“I knew we were getting a raise but I didn’t know how much,”she said.,“The only time it’s ever been brought up is when our boss told us to work harder because we’re getting a raise.”

In 2006, a constitutional amendment was placed on the ballot tying minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index. After nearly a decade without a minimum wage increase, said Tim Burga, president of the Ohio AFl-CIO,“Ohioans overwhelmingly passed the amendment.”Minimum wage in Ohio that year was $4.25 an hour.

That amendment set the minimum wage at $6.85 hourly, a hefty jump from the existing federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour at the time.

Originally passed as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the purpose of the minimum wage was to prevent market forces from driving down the wages of the country’s lowest earners.

For Adam Erbrick, 17, the 30-cent-per-hour increase will help him save more for a planned choir trip to Florida in April.

“It will make a difference. It will allow me to plan out my spending a little bit more,”said the GlenOak High School junior who works 10 hours a week at Wendy’s.“I try to put most of it away but I keep a little spending money, too.”

The raise also means employers, will have to pay increased Social Security, Medicare and workers’compensation and unemployment insurance that accompany the wage increase. It also means they likely will need to realign pay scales for higher-paid employees.
