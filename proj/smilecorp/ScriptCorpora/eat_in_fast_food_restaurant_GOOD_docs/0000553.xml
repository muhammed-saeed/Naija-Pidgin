 Re:new guy in VA Fri, 01/15/10 12:26 AM ( permalink ) hey check Craigslist first before buying brand new... save yourself ALOT of money... The closest i&apos;ve found near you ( chesterfield ) was Richmond.
Type in hot dog cart in the search area, I tried posting links, but for some reason, they weren&apos;t working. sorry

or even try ben&apos;s carts  The cash cow is only $1700 


Good Luck !!!

I would grab a pad of paper and just cruise around your area. Check prices on everything from soda to paper products. Test all the hot dog joints or carts and pick their brains. Look up local meat supply companies as well. A local meat supply would be ideal if it has the right taste. Search bakeries for buns. Write down all the prices on your note pad as you go. Then start doing taste tests. I really like the product I serve, but i still want to find that perfect dog and bun. My search is always on.

Before you start doing any of the above I suggest a call to your local health department and insurance agent. This way you can get an idea how much everything will cost you annually. Health Dept. fees, liability insurance, and all the things your cart is required to have in order to pass the inspection (before you purchase it).

Good Luck

 Re:new guy in VA Sat, 01/16/10 1:27 AM ( permalink ) yeah, I agree with quickdog. You wanna grab the specs from the hot dog cart you wanna buy and fax them to the HD. Usually there is a plan review fee, In MD it&apos;s $175&amp;then the license itself is $280.

Sams club has a bulk hot dog by Baker&amp;Chef, It&apos;s $19.00&amp;that will get ya 80. Some say they are a tad bit salty but you can always take them back and get your money back if you don&apos;t like them. That&apos;s what I like most about SClub.

Also check out a company called Murray&apos;s Fine Meats. I did some wholesale sampling with them, and they&apos;re food isn&apos;t bad at all and it&apos;s cheap as hell. A few people out my way use them.

 Re:new guy in VA Sat, 01/16/10 10:49 AM ( permalink ) hi maddawg. 
quickdog is right on about doing your research. i don&apos;t remember running into a hot dog person unwilliing to share ideas. as you read around here you&apos;ll find that some areas require certain brands or kinds of dogs if you want to get customers. some store here actually brag about serving Oscar Meyer or Ball Park. people really go for my dogs.

what i use actually comes from VA. it&apos;s a very tasty skinless, all beef Gwaltney brand made by Smithfield intended for veding. i get it from a small local wholesaler here for about $2/lb.

i would contact them at smithfieldfoods and find out if they have a local supplier. they boil ok, but i think they are meant to be grilled. the latter gives them an excellent appearance and a bit of a snap.

best wishes

 Re:new guy in VA Mon, 01/18/10 11:47 AM ( permalink ) Never been &quot;robed&quot; (my daughter thinks she might like to be &quot;robed&quot; though, it&apos;s it&apos;s soft, fluffy and smells good). Never been robbed either. We have a cash drawer with a lock. If we step away from the cart, we lock the drawer and take the key, that includes getting something out of the &quot;support vehicle&quot;. We don&apos;t take anything larger than a $20 bill. We keep a zippered cash bag hidden on a lower shelf shoved all the way to the back with stuff in front of it. It holds our back up stash of one&apos;s/quarters and we drop our drawer when we get too many bills. We keep a low cash drawer ($1 = $20-$30, $5 = $50 - $60, $10 = $30 - $50, often less.... we move $20&apos;s out as soon as customers leave and there is no one to see us drop the drawer). I worked for several years as a cashier. I was taught to keep the cash drawer &quot;dropped&quot;. David worked flea markets and learned to keep his &quot;working&quot; cash separate from his accumulated cash. You don&apos;t flash a big wad unless you are asking for trouble... anywhere, anytime. We do not set up in &quot;dangerous&quot; areas. David set up outside of a bar once. He got uneasy and decided it was too risky (and this is a guy who used to tend bar on a very rough motorcycle bar). 

We use Sam&apos;s all beef hot dogs. If you use them... SIMMER slowly for about 5 minutes of so. Do not boil. Boiling makes them tough and blow them up. Slow simmer allows the excess salt to leach out. They hold well at 150F - 155F. This is also why we use sterno cans. To keep the heat down low enough.

Generally we don&apos;t talk about cash situations on boards, many times people who or shady just want to lean how you/we do things so they know the quickest way to rob a vendor. Ever notice there are very few threads that talk about money? There is a reason for that. I would think twice about given out this type of info. Don&apos;t think because it says a person is in VA by their RF name that&apos;s where they are. They might be in your own city and have visited you before. You would be surprised how quick people in talking mention roadfood, before you know it you are telling them your screen name and then they just set back and learn all about you. Not saying that is what this poster is doing but.

Please be careful.

 Re:new guy in VA Mon, 01/25/10 3:20 PM ( permalink ) Just talked to the local health dept guy to see why its taking so long to get approvel of my application.He said he needs to get through the renewals first.But he did say I could not serve chilli or cheese sauce with out a seperate permit for both of those products.Commissary is only needed to store products and dump grey water cleaning can be done on the cart solong as iot has hot/cold running water with a grey water holding tank 15% larger than the clean water tank. other than that VA dosnt really care what the cart has as long as its not a slap together home made P.O.S lol their words   #13

Evidently you have never been a cashier. This is basic stuff that you are taught the first day or (if you are slow) the first week. I&apos;ve worked as a cashier in a convenience store (at a time when cashiers for that chain were being found dead in the coolers as a result of robberies), in a lumber yard and in a fast food restaurant.

Most, if not all, of the food vendors do not have drop safes on their carts. You don&apos;t think a thief knows that? Folks who will rob you know where the money is. You stand to lose more from a quick change artist than a run of the mill thief. We don&apos;t make change either! This stuff need to be talked about, at least in a sticky type post. Unless you have had to walk around with a large sum of $$ in your pocket, around folks who will steal a $1 or less item and are a naturally suspicious person, then you will not think about the fat pile of $$ in your cash drawer. there are no NEW ways to deal with cash as a vendor. It&apos;s all old stuff.


Yet I have seen several on this board advocate setting up in front of bars late at night?  That is far more dangerous than what I posted.

In Arizona there are two ways to deal with robbers. One is called &quot;Open Carry&quot; the other is called &quot;Concealed Carry&quot;. Yes it is still the wild west out here in the desert.
