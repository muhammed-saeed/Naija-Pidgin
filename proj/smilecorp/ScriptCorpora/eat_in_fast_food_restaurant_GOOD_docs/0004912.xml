Piss in a cup for Thorpe Park’s new attraction

So basically, there’s a new ride at Thorpe Park called SAW Alive which is based on the most horrible bits of the six Saw films. And because the people who run everyone’s favourite theme park in Surrey are weird, they want it to smell like piss.

They are, therefore, asking members of the public to pay them a visit this Friday February 26 between 11am–2pm and piss in a pot.

One person’s piss will be chosen as‘the one’, and that person will get£500 cash and get to tell everyone they’re the signature stench of what Thorpe Park are calling“the world’s most extreme live action horror maze”.

 GO HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION 

Here are some tips to help you get your piss really stinky:

 1/ Eat asparagus to give your urine a rotten cabbage pong.

 2/ Drink beer and lager to achieve a corn-like hum.

 3/ Cut down on your water intake to dehydrate the body which will make your piss more concentrated and offensively whiffy.

 4/ Drink 10 cups of coffee a day.

 5/ Put away salty food such as pepperoni, ketchup, crisps and ready meals to leave a vile stench.

 6/ Garlic, garlic and more garlic will be sure to give off a potent odour.

 7/ Scoff your body weight in curry to achieve a nostril burning aroma.

 8/ Get AIDs.
