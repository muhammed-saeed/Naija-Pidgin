Restaurants 
 at Victoria Peak
 Above: view from Victoria Peak with the Mid-Levles and buildings in Central 
 district and Wanchai in the foreground, Kowloon in the distance separated by the Victoria 
 Harbor . 
 
You can drink in the breathtaking view from Victoria 
 Peak with a meal or drinks, or just coffee, or even 
 burger and fries from a fast food restaurant.

Below is a list to choose from. (But then, there&apos;s no telling 
 if each restaurant is still there when you read this. After 
 all, Hong 
 Kong changes faster than even the weather - almost ! (2007.7.7)
