Respecto al 9/11 estadounidense, el 3/11 madrileño ostenta un añadido en la estrategia terrorista: además de causar el mayor número posible de asesinatos, la intención de influir brutalmente en la circunstancia política del país victimado. Lo consiguió en toda la línea: gracias a la salvaje matanza, un número considerable de electores españoles, dolidos y enfurecidos, votaron a la oposición y derribaron al partido de gobierno, al que hasta entonces todos los sondeos auguraban la victoria. Según un consenso unánime castigaban así la decisión de Aznar de apoyar la intervención militar anglo-estadounidense en Irak contra Sadam Husein, que fue siempre muy impopular en toda España. De este modo, José María Aznar, el estadista que desde la transición dio el impulso más potente al crecimien...

Along with his cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and merlot wines, Jackson Kramer keeps locally grown Cherokee, Arkansas Traveler and Green Zebra tomatoes in his wine cellar at Interim restaurant.
 It keeps them 58 degrees,&quot;said Kramer, the restaurant&apos;s executive chef.&quot;You can&apos;t keep them at room temperature &apos;cause they go really fast. Then you can&apos;t keep them in your walk-in &apos;cause it&apos;s too cold.

 Table Talk 

I may be the best-prepared chef in Madison, but I don&apos;t touch the kitchen at La Concha. I&apos;m enchanted by Mexico and I love Mexican food . I had a condo in Acapulco for 14 years, and my first restaurant in Madison was Mexican - the long-gone Pacos, on upper State Street. I was a manager there many years ago. I&apos;m Mexican in my heart now, too. At La Paella I was don Tomás. Here I&apos;m Tomás, nada más. Though I still make paella at home. I prepare it here for the staff sometimes, too, but not to sell.
 The food at La Concha would lose its sabor mexicano if I started tweaking it with my Spanish touch. La Concha is worlds apart from La Paella. Our clients here are 80% Mexican at lunchtime - the rest are non-Mexican business people who can&apos;t resist our cemitas, Cuban sandwiches and tacos Arabes.

 Enforcement of environmental law in United States and European law: realities and expectations. 

The effectiveness of environmental law enforcement at both the national and international levels may be enhanced by a global recognition of the need to enact clear legal implementation procedures and integrated, precise, but flexible laws. International usage of environmental audit techniques, eco-contracts, and other innovations are changing the ways in which enforcement can be achieved.
