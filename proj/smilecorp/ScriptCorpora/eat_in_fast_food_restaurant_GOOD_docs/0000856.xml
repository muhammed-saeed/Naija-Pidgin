 Japanese FastFood by Karate Kid–Wacha! 
 By Blog.MonsterComments.Com – August 14, 2008 Posted in: Cuisine , Delivery , Directory , Food , Japanese , Location , Makati , Manila , What&apos;s Hot Hey there!

In line with my new shift of interest to exploring fastfood meals–here’s my next post. We came across this place (Karate Kid) inside WalterMart, Makati. It had a decent amount of people lined up on the counter so we decided to try it out.

 

Prices are quite affordable compared to other Japanese Fast Food chains out there. Php150 bucks will do for a decent and complete meal.

 

 

We ordered the beef gyudon, yakisoba, and chicken tepanyaki–all of which hit the mark for me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that its the best I’ve tasted–I’m simply saying that this goes for a decent japanese fast food meal. Expectations were met and they were all really tasty. Just one comment on the Yakisoba, I’m not an expert on japanese cuisine but the noodles are a bit off because its not as thick as what I’m used to and the flavor playfully touches on the domain of our local pancit canton–which could be what they were aiming for. Who knows.

 

 

They deliver!

In one of my earlier posts about Sumo Sam, I got a“hate”comment from a glorified fan of that establishment. The comment probably came from a“poser”convinced that he/she lives in a world where they are the authority–Hahaha–that’s just sad. But anyway, the reason why I’m mentioning it here is because it got me thinking whether my taste was indeed engineered to appreciate low end fast food types…interestingly, I’d have to agree. I do enjoy the cheap food trips Still, that doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy sophisticated flavors that come with a hefty price tag.

This post is hot.. so here’s a few more pics.  This time from their branch in Ayala…service was ok tho.. line was way too long.
