In this edition we have endeavored to strengthen the basic characteristics of the book. Thesubject matter has been presented systematically in ten chapters, which can enable the reader tomaster the topics covered without any additional guidance. In keeping with the basic objective ofmaking the learning of the ‘Concept and Principles in Production and Operations Management’, thefollowing chapters have been revised as per the suggestions. Chapter 1 on Introduction to POM was revised with the addition of Managing GlobalOperations with the concept of globalization. Chapter 2 on Plant Location and Layout wasrevised with locational models and the design of product and process layout. Service layout wasalso included. Chapter 4 on Materials Management was revised with the addition of specialpurchasing system. Chapter 6 on Quality Control was revised with the addition of ISO 14000series along with the recognized bodies for ISO certification. Chapter 8 on MaintenanceManagement was revised with the concept of Total Preventive Maintenance. The revised edition also contains Caselets which provides additional input to understand thesubject with practical application of the techniques used in each chapter. For the development of application skill of the theoretical knowledge of production and operationmanagement, it is necessary to arrange for a visit or conduct the project work either by individualor group of students in a manufacturing or service organisation. In this context the revised edition contains skill development/practicals in each chapter. Forthis purpose the students are adviced to visit a Fast Food Restaurant like Pizza Hut or Pizza Cornerfor getting the information for the questions given under skill development in each chapter. In addition to the caselet, cases are given to understand the entire concept of production andoperations management at the end of the book. Complete care has been taken to make the book error free.

AUTHORS PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION Production and Operations Management has been recognised as an important factor in acountry’s economic growth. The traditional view of manufacturing management is the concept ofProduction Management with the focus on economic efficiency in manufacturing. Later the newname Operations Management was identified, as service sector became more prominent. Rapidchanges in technology has posed numerous opportunities and challenges which have resulted inenhancement of manufacturing capabilities through new materials, facilities, techniques and proce-dures. Hence, managing a service/production system has become a major challenge in the globalcompetitive environment. Production and Operations Management leads the way for the organisa-tions to achieve its goals with minimum effort. Hence the study of the subject at undergraduate andpostgraduate level has more significance. This book on ‘Production and Operations Management’ covers the complete syllabus ofBachelor of Business Management of Bangalore University, however the coverage is wide enoughto include the requirements of the other Indian Universities and professional courses like MBA andEngineering. Being student-friendly is the unique feature of this book. The subject matter has been presentedsystematically in ten chapters, which can enable the reader master the topics covered without anyadditional guidance. Complete care has been taken to make the book error free. However, mistakes might havecrept inadvertently. Readers finding any error are requested to bring it to our notice, for enablingus to rectify them in our future editions. We are grateful to Mr. Saumya Gupta, Managing Director and Mr. Babu V.R. of New AgeInternational (P) Ltd., for providing us this opportunity to share our knowledge with you. Our acknowledgements are also due to Dr. Poornima Anil Kumar and Mrs. BharathiSuresh, Mr. K. Raghavendra and M.N.

Development 1.6 Operating System • Caselet 1.1 INTRODUCTIONProduction/operations management is the process, which combines and transforms variousresources used in the production/operations subsystem of the organization into value addedproduct/services in a controlled manner as per the policies of the organization. Therefore, it isthat part of an organization, which is concerned with the transformation of a range of inputs intothe required (products/services) having the requisite quality level. The set of interrelated management activities, which are involved in manufacturing certainproducts, is called as production management. If the same concept is extended to servicesmanagement, then the corresponding set of management activities is called as operationsmanagement. 1.2 HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTFor over two centuries operations and production management has been recognised as animportant factor in a country’s economic growth. 1 PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The traditional view of manufacturing management began in eighteenth century when AdamSmith recognised the economic benefits of specialisation of labour. He recommended breakingof jobs down into subtasks and recognises workers to specialised tasks in which they wouldbecome highly skilled and efficient. In the early twentieth century, F.W. Taylor implementedSmith’s theories and developed scientific management. From then till 1930, many techniqueswere developed prevailing the traditional view. Brief information about the contributions tomanufacturing management is shown in the Table 1.1. TABLE 1.1 Historical summary of operations management Date Contribution Contributor 1776 Specialization of labour in manufacturing Adam Smith 1799 Interchangeable parts, cost accounting Eli Whitney and others 1832 Division of labour by skill; assignment of jobs by skill; basics of time study Charles Babbage 1900 Scientific management time study and work study developed; dividing planning and doing of work Frederick W. Taylor 1900 Motion of study of jobs Frank B. Gilbreth 1901 Scheduling techniques for employees, machines jobs in manufacturing Henry L. Gantt 1915 Economic lot sizes for inventory control F.W.

Wright and control, Material requirement planning (MRP) 1980 Quality and productivity applications from Japan: W.E. Deming and robotics, CAD-CAM J. Juran. Production management becomes the acceptable term from 1930s to 1950s. AsF.W. Taylor’s works become more widely known, managers developed techniques that focussedon economic efficiency in manufacturing. Workers were studied in great detail to eliminatewasteful efforts and achieve greater efficiency. At the same time, psychologists, socialists and INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT !other social scientists began to study people and human behaviour in the working environment.In addition, economists, mathematicians, and computer socialists contributed newer, moresophisticated analytical approaches. With the 1970s emerges two distinct changes in our views. The most obvious of these,reflected in the new name operations management was a shift in the service and manufacturingsectors of the economy. As service sector became more prominent, the change from ‘production’to ‘operations’ emphasized the broadening of our field to service organizations. The second, moresuitable change was the beginning of an emphasis on synthesis, rather than just analysis, inmanagement practices. 1.3 CONCEPT OF PRODUCTIONProduction function is that part of an organization, which is concerned with the transformationof a range of inputs into the required outputs (products) having the requisite quality level. Production is defined as “the step-by-step conversion of one form of material intoanother form through chemical or mechanical process to create or enhance the utility ofthe product to the user.” Thus production is a value addition process. At each stage ofprocessing, there will be value addition. Edwood Buffa defines production as ‘a process by which goods and services are created’. Some examples of production are: manufacturing custom-made products like, boilers with aspecific capacity, constructing flats, some structural fabrication works for selected customers,etc., and manufacturing standardized products like, car, bus, motor cycle, radio, television, etc. Fig. 1.1 Schematic production system 1.4 PRODUCTION SYSTEMThe production system of an organization is that part, which produces products of an organization.It is that activity whereby resources, flowing within a defined system, are combined and transformedin a controlled manner to add value in accordance with the policies communicated by management.A simplified production system is shown above. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The production system has the following characteristics: 1. Production is an organized activity, so every production system has an objective. 2. The system transforms the various inputs to useful outputs. 3. It does not operate in isolation from the other organization system. 4. There exists a feedback about the activities, which is essential to control and improve system performance.1.4.1 Classification of Production SystemProduction systems can be classified as Job Shop, Batch, Mass and Continuous Productionsystems. Fig. 1.2 Classification of production systemsJOB SHOP PRODUCTIONJob shop production are characterised by manufacturing of one or few quantity of productsdesigned and produced as per the specification of customers within prefixed time and cost. Thedistinguishing feature of this is low volume and high variety of products. A job shop comprises of general purpose machines arranged into different departments.Each job demands unique technological requirements, demands processing on machines in acertain sequence.Characteristics The Job-shop production system is followed when there is: 1. High variety of products and low volume. 2. Use of general purpose machines and facilities. 3. Highly skilled operators who can take up each job as a challenge because of uniqueness. 4. Large inventory of materials, tools, parts. 5. Detailed planning is essential for sequencing the requirements of each product, capacities for each work centre and order priorities. INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT #Advantages Following are the advantages of job shop production: 1. Because of general purpose machines and facilities variety of products can be produced. 2. Operators will become more skilled and competent, as each job gives them learning opportunities. 3. Full potential of operators can be utilised. 4. Opportunity exists for creative methods and innovative ideas.Limitations Following are the limitations of job shop production: 1. Higher cost due to frequent set up changes. 2. Higher level of inventory at all levels and hence higher inventory cost. 3. Production planning is complicated. 4. Larger space requirements.BATCH PRODUCTIONBatch production is defined by American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) “asa form of manufacturing in which the job passes through the functional departments in lotsor batches and each lot may have a different routing.” It is characterised by the manufactureof limited number of products produced at regular intervals and stocked awaiting sales.Characteristics Batch production system is used under the following circumstances: 1. When there is shorter production runs. 2. When plant and machinery are flexible. 3. When plant and machinery set up is used for the production of item in a batch and change of set up is required for processing the next batch. 4. When manufacturing lead time and cost are lower as compared to job order production.Advantages Following are the advantages of batch production: 1. Better utilisation of plant and machinery. 2. Promotes functional specialisation. 3. Cost per unit is lower as compared to job order production. 4. Lower investment in plant and machinery. 5. Flexibility to accommodate and process number of products. 6. Job satisfaction exists for operators.Limitations Following are the limitations of batch production: 1. Material handling is complex because of irregular and longer flows. 2. Production planning and control is complex. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 3. Work in process inventory is higher compared to continuous production. 4. Higher set up costs due to frequent changes in set up.MASS PRODUCTIONManufacture of discrete parts or assemblies using a continuous process are called mass production.This production system is justified by very large volume of production. The machines are arrangedin a line or product layout. Product and process standardisation exists and all outputs follow thesame path.Characteristics Mass production is used under the following circumstances: 1. Standardisation of product and process sequence. 2. Dedicated special purpose machines having higher production capacities and output rates. 3. Large volume of products. 4. Shorter cycle time of production. 5. Lower in process inventory. 6. Perfectly balanced production lines. 7. Flow of materials, components and parts is continuous and without any back tracking. 8. Production planning and control is easy. 9. Material handling can be completely automatic.Advantages Following are the advantages of mass production: 1. Higher rate of production with reduced cycle time. 2. Higher capacity utilisation due to line balancing. 3. Less skilled operators are required. 4. Low process inventory. 5. Manufacturing cost per unit is low.Limitations Following are the limitations of mass production: 1. Breakdown of one machine will stop an entire production line. 2. Line layout needs major change with the changes in the product design. 3. High investment in production facilities. 4. The cycle time is determined by the slowest operation.CONTINUOUS PRODUCTIONProduction facilities are arranged as per the sequence of production operations from the firstoperations to the finished product. The items are made to flow through the sequence of operationsthrough material handling devices such as conveyors, transfer devices, etc.Characteristics Continuous production is used under the following circumstances: 1. Dedicated plant and equipment with zero flexibility. INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT % 2. Material handling is fully automated. 3. Process follows a predetermined sequence of operations. 4. Component materials cannot be readily identified with final product. 5. Planning and scheduling is a routine action.Advantages Following are the advantages of continuous production: 1. Standardisation of product and process sequence. 2. Higher rate of production with reduced cycle time. 3. Higher capacity utilisation due to line balancing. 4. Manpower is not required for material handling as it is completely automatic. 5. Person with limited skills can be used on the production line. 6. Unit cost is lower due to high volume of production.Limitations Following are the limitations of continuous production: 1. Flexibility to accommodate and process number of products does not exist. 2. Very high investment for setting flow lines. 3. Product differentiation is limited. 1.5 PRODUCTION MANAGEMENTProduction management is a process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the activitiesof the production function. It combines and transforms various resources used in the productionsubsystem of the organization into value added product in a controlled manner as per the policiesof the organization. E.S. Buffa defines production management as, “Production management deals withdecision making related to production processes so that the resulting goods or services areproduced according to specifications, in the amount and by the schedule demanded andout of minimum cost.”1.5.1Objectives of Production ManagementThe objective of the production management is ‘to produce goods services of right quality andquantity at the right time and right manufacturing cost’.1. RIGHT QUALITYThe quality of product is established based upon the customers needs. The right quality is notnecessarily best quality. It is determined by the cost of the product and the technical characteristicsas suited to the specific requirements.2. RIGHT QUANTITYThe manufacturing organization should produce the products in right number. If they are producedin excess of demand the capital will block up in the form of inventory and if the quantity isproduced in short of demand, leads to shortage of products. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT3. RIGHT TIMETimeliness of delivery is one of the important parameter to judge the effectiveness of productiondepartment. So, the production department has to make the optimal utilization of input resourcesto achieve its objective.4. RIGHT MANUFACTURING COSTManufacturing costs are established before the product is actually manufactured. Hence, allattempts should be made to produce the products at pre-established cost, so as to reduce thevariation between actual and the standard (pre-established) cost. 1.6 OPERATING SYSTEMOperating system converts inputs in order to provide outputs which are required by a customer.It converts physical resources into outputs, the function of which is to satisfy customer wants i.e.,to provide some utility for the customer. In some of the organization the product is a physicalgood (hotels) while in others it is a service (hospitals). Bus and taxi services, tailors, hospital andbuilders are the examples of an operating system. Everett E. Adam&amp;Ronald J. Ebert define operating system as, “An operating system( function) of an organization is the part of an organization that produces the organization’sphysical goods and services.” Ray Wild defines operating system as, “An operating system is a configuration of resourcescombined for the provision of goods or services.”1.6.1 Concept of OperationsAn operation is defined in terms of the mission it serves for the organization, technology it employsand the human and managerial processes it involves. Operations in an organization can be categorisedinto manufacturing operations and service operations. Manufacturing operations is a conversionprocess that includes manufacturing yields a tangible output: a product, whereas, a conversion processthat includes service yields an intangible output: a deed, a performance, an effort.1.6.2Distinction between Manufacturing Operations and Service OperationsFollowing characteristics can be considered for distinguishing manufacturing operations withservice operations: 1. Tangible/Intangible nature of output 2. Consumption of output 3. Nature of work (job) 4. Degree of customer contact 5. Customer participation in conversion 6. Measurement of performance. Manufacturing is characterised by tangible outputs (products), outputs that customers consumeovertime, jobs that use less labour and more equipment, little customer contact, no customerparticipation in the conversion process (in production), and sophisticated methods for measuringproduction activities and resource consumption as product are made. INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT Service is characterised by intangible outputs, outputs that customers consumes immediately,jobs that use more labour and less equipment, direct consumer contact, frequent customerparticipation in the conversion process, and elementary methods for measuring conversion activitiesand resource consumption. Some services are equipment based namely rail-road services, telephoneservices and some are people based namely tax consultant services, hair styling. 1.7 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT1.7.1 A Framework for Managing OperationsManaging operations can be enclosed in a frame of general management function as shown inFig. 1.3. Operation managers are concerned with planning, organizing, and controlling the activitieswhich affect human behaviour through models.PLANNINGActivities that establishes a course of action and guide future decision-making is planning.The operations manager defines the objectives for the operations subsystem of the organization,and the policies, and procedures for achieving the objectives. This stage includes clarifying therole and focus of operations in the organization’s overall strategy. It also involves productplanning, facility designing and using the conversion process.ORGANIZINGActivities that establishes a structure of tasks and authority. Operation managers establish astructure of roles and the flow of information within the operations subsystem. They determinethe activities required to achieve the goals and assign authority and responsibility for carryingthem out.CONTROLLINGActivities that assure the actual performance in accordance with planned performance. Toensure that the plans for the operations subsystems are accomplished, the operations managermust exercise control by measuring actual outputs and comparing them to planned operationsmanagement. Controlling costs, quality, and schedules are the important functions here.BEHAVIOUROperation managers are concerned with how their efforts to plan, organize, and control affecthuman behaviour. They also want to know how the behaviour of subordinates can affectmanagement’s planning, organizing, and controlling actions. Their interest lies in decision-makingbehaviour.MODELSAs operation managers plan, organise, and control the conversion process, they encounter manyproblems and must make many decisions. They can simplify their difficulties using models likeaggregate planning models for examining how best to use existing capacity in short-term,break even analysis to identify break even volumes, linear programming and computersimulation for capacity utilisation, decision tree analysis for long-term capacity problem offacility expansion, simple median model for determining best locations of facilities etc. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTFig. 1.3 General model for managing operations INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT 1.7.2 Objectives of Operations ManagementObjectives of operations management can be categorised into customer service and resourceutilisation.CUSTOMER SERVICEThe first objective of operating systems is the customer serivce to the satisfaction of customerwants. Therefore, customer service is a key objective of operations management. The operatingsystem must provide something to a specification which can satisfy the customer in terms of costand timing. Thus, primary objective can be satisfied by providing the ‘right thing at a right priceat the right time’. These aspects of customer service—specification, cost and timing—are described for fourfunctions in Table 1.2. They are the principal sources of customer satisfaction and must, therefore,be the principal dimension of the customer service objective for operations managers. TABLE 1.2 Aspects of customer service Principal Principal customer wants function Primary considerations Other considerations Manufacture Goods of a given, requested or Cost, i.e., purchase price or cost of obtaining goods. acceptable specification Timing, i.e., delivery delay from order or request to receipt of goods. Transport Management of a given, requested Cost, i.e., cost of movements. Timing, i.e., or acceptable specification 1. Duration or time to move. 2. Wait or delay from requesting to its commen- cement. Supply Goods of a given, requested or Cost, i.e., purchase price or cost of obtaining acceptable specification goods. Timing, i.e., delivery delay from order or request to receipt of goods. Service Treatment of a given, requested or Cost, i.e., cost of movements. acceptable specification Timing, i.e., 1. Duration or time required for treatment. 2. Wait or delay from requesting treatment to its commencement. Generally an organization will aim reliably and consistently to achieve certain standards andoperations manager will be influential in attempting to achieve these standards. Hence, thisobjective will influence the operations manager’s decisions to achieve the required customerservice.RESOURCE UTILISATIONAnother major objective of operating systems is to utilise resources for the satisfaction ofcustomer wants effectively, i.e., customer service must be provided with the achievement of PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTeffective operations through efficient use of resources. Inefficient use of resources or inadequatecustomer service leads to commercial failure of an operating system. Operations management is concerned essentially with the utilisation of resources, i.e., obtainingmaximum effect from resources or minimising their loss, under utilisation or waste. The extentof the utilisation of the resources’ potential might be expressed in terms of the proportion ofavailable time used or occupied, space utilisation, levels of activity, etc. Each measure indicatesthe extent to which the potential or capacity of such resources is utilised. This is referred as theobjective of resource utilisation. Operations management is also concerned with the achievement of both satisfactory customerservice and resource utilisation. An improvement in one will often give rise to deterioration in theother. Often both cannot be maximised, and hence a satisfactory performance must be achievedon both objectives. All the activities of operations management must be tackled with these twoobjectives in mind, and many of the problems will be faced by operations managers because ofthis conflict. Hence, operations managers must attempt to balance these basic objectives. Table 1.3 summarises the twin objectives of operations management. The type of balanceestablished both between and within these basic objectives will be influenced by marketconsiderations, competitions, the strengths and weaknesses of the organization, etc. Hence, theoperations managers should make a contribution when these objectives are set. TABLE 1.3 The twin objectives of operations management The customer service objective. The resource utilisation objective. To achieve To provide agreed/adequate levels of customer adequate levels of resource utilisation (or service (and hence customer satisfaction) by productivity) e.g., to achieve agreed levels of providing goods or services with the right utilisation of materials, machines and labour. specification, at the right cost and at the right time. 1.8 MANAGING GLOBAL OPERATIONSThe term ‘globalization’ describes businesses’ deployment of facilities and operations around theworld. Globalization can be defined as a process in which geographic distance becomes a factorof diminishing importance in the establishment and maintenance of cross border economic, politicaland socio-cultural relations. It can also be defined as worldwide drive toward a globalizedeconomic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are notaccountable to democratic processes or national governments. There are four developments, which have spurred the trend toward globalization. These are: 1. Improved transportation and communication technologies; 2. Opened financial systems; 3. Increased demand for imports; and 4. Reduced import quotas and other trade barriers. When a firm sets up facilities abroad it involve some added complexities in its operation.Global markets impose new standards on quality and time. Managers should not think aboutdomestic markets first and then global markets later, rather it could be think globally and act INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT !locally. Also, they must have a good understanding of their competitors. Some other importantchallenges of managing multinational operations include other languages and customs, differentmanagement style, unfamiliar laws and regulations, and different costs. Managing global operations would focus on the following key issues: l To acquire and properly utilize the following concepts and those related to global operations, supply chain, logistics, etc. l To associate global historical events to key drivers in global operations from different perspectives. l To develop criteria for conceptualization and evaluation of different global operations. l To associate success and failure cases of global operations to political, social, economical and technological environments. l To envision trends in global operations. l To develop an understanding of the world vision regardless of their country of origin, residence or studies in a respectful way of perspectives of people from different races, studies, preferences, religion, politic affiliation, place of origin, etc. 1.9 SCOPE OF PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTProduction and operations management concern with the conversion of inputs into outputs, usingphysical resources, so as to provide the desired utilities to the customer while meeting the otherorganizational objectives of effectiveness, efficiency and adoptability. It distinguishes itself fromother functions such as personnel, marketing, finance, etc., by its primary concern for ‘conversionby using physical resources.’ Following are the activities which are listed under production andoperations management functions: 1. Location of facilities 2. Plant layouts and material handling 3. Product design 4. Process design 5. Production and planning control 6. Quality control 7. Materials management 8. Maintenance management.LOCATION OF FACILITIESLocation of facilities for operations is a long-term capacity decision which involves a long termcommitment about the geographically static factors that affect a business organization. It is animportant strategic level decision-making for an organization. It deals with the questions such as‘where our main operations should be based?’ The selection of location is a key-decision as large investment is made in building plant andmachinery. An improper location of plant may lead to waste of all the investments made in plantand machinery equipments. Hence, location of plant should be based on the company’s expansion &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTplan and policy, diversification plan for the products, changing sources of raw materials and manyother factors. The purpose of the location study is to find the optimal location that will resultsin the greatest advantage to the organization.PLANT LAYOUT AND MATERIAL HANDLINGPlant layout refers to the physical arrangement of facilities. It is the configuration of departments,work centres and equipment in the conversion process. The overall objective of the plant layoutis to design a physical arrangement that meets the required output quality and quantity mosteconomically. According to James Moore, “Plant layout is a plan of an optimum arrangement offacilities including personnel, operating equipment, storage space, material handlingequipments and all other supporting services along with the design of best structureto contain all these facilities”. ‘Material Handling’ refers to the ‘moving of materials from the store room to the machineand from one machine to the next during the process of manufacture’. It is also defined as the‘art and science of moving, packing and storing of products in any form’. It is a specialisedactivity for a modern manufacturing concern, with 50 to 75% of the cost of production. This costcan be reduced by proper section, operation and maintenance of material handling devices.Material handling devices increases the output, improves quality, speeds up the deliveries anddecreases the cost of production. Hence, material handling is a prime consideration in thedesigning new plant and several existing plants.PRODUCT DESIGNProduct design deals with conversion of ideas into reality. Every business organization have todesign, develop and introduce new products as a survival and growth strategy. Developing thenew products and launching them in the market is the biggest challenge faced by the organizations.The entire process of need identification to physical manufactures of product involves threefunctions: marketing, product development, manufacturing. Product development translates theneeds of customers given by marketing into technical specifications and designing the variousfeatures into the product to these specifications. Manufacturing has the responsibility of selectingthe processes by which the product can be manufactured. Product design and developmentprovides link between marketing, customer needs and expectations and the activities required tomanufacture the product.PROCESS DESIGNProcess design is a macroscopic decision-making of an overall process route for converting theraw material into finished goods. These decisions encompass the selection of a process, choiceof technology, process flow analysis and layout of the facilities. Hence, the important decisionsin process design are to analyse the workflow for converting raw material into finished productand to select the workstation for each included in the workflow.PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROLProduction planning and control can be defined as the process of planning the production in advance,setting the exact route of each item, fixing the starting and finishing dates for each item, to giveproduction orders to shops and to follow up the progress of products according to orders. INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT # The principle of production planning and control lies in the statement ‘First Plan Your Workand then Work on Your Plan’. Main functions of production planning and control includesplanning, routing, scheduling, dispatching and follow-up. Planning is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it and who is to doit. Planning bridges the gap from where we are, to where we want to go. It makes it possiblefor things to occur which would not otherwise happen. Routing may be defined as the selection of path which each part of the product will follow,which being transformed from raw material to finished products. Routing determines the mostadvantageous path to be followed from department to department and machine to machine tillraw material gets its final shape. Scheduling determines the programme for the operations. Scheduling may be defined as‘the fixation of time and date for each operation’ as well as it determines the sequence ofoperations to be followed. Fig. 1.4 Scope of production and operations management Dispatching is concerned with the starting the processes. It gives necessary authority soas to start a particular work, which has already been planned under ‘Routing’ and ‘Scheduling’.Therefore, dispatching is ‘release of orders and instruction for the starting of production for anyitem in acceptance with the route sheet and schedule charts’. The function of follow-up is to report daily the progress of work in each shop in a prescribedproforma and to investigate the causes of deviations from the planned performance. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTQUALITY CONTROLQuality Control (QC) may be defined as ‘a system that is used to maintain a desired level ofquality in a product or service’. It is a systematic control of various factors that affect the qualityof the product. Quality control aims at prevention of defects at the source, relies on effectivefeed back system and corrective action procedure. Quality control can also be defined as ‘that industrial management technique by means of whichproduct of uniform acceptable quality is manufactured’. It is the entire collection of activities whichensures that the operation will produce the optimum quality products at minimum cost. The main objectives of quality control are: l To improve the companies income by making the production more acceptable to the customers i.e., by providing long life, greater usefulness, maintainability, etc. l To reduce companies cost through reduction of losses due to defects. l To achieve interchangeability of manufacture in large scale production. l To produce optimal quality at reduced price. l To ensure satisfaction of customers with productions or services or high quality level, to build customer goodwill, confidence and reputation of manufacturer. l To make inspection prompt to ensure quality control. l To check the variation during manufacturing.MATERIALS MANAGEMENTMaterials management is that aspect of management function which is primarily concerned withthe acquisition, control and use of materials needed and flow of goods and services connectedwith the production process having some predetermined objectives in view. The main objectives of materials management are: l To minimise material cost. l To purchase, receive, transport and store materials efficiently and to reduce the related cost. l To cut down costs through simplification, standardisation, value analysis, import substitution, etc. l To trace new sources of supply and to develop cordial relations with them in order to ensure continuous supply at reasonable rates. l To reduce investment tied in the inventories for use in other productive purposes and to develop high inventory turnover ratios.MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENTIn modern industry, equipment and machinery are a very important part of the total productiveeffort. Therefore, their idleness or downtime becomes are very expensive. Hence, it is veryimportant that the plant machinery should be properly maintained. The main objectives of maintenance management are: 1. To achieve minimum breakdown and to keep the plant in good working condition at the lowest possible cost. 2. To keep the machines and other facilities in such a condition that permits them to be used at their optimal capacity without interruption. 3. To ensure the availability of the machines, buildings and services required by other sections of the factory for the performance of their functions at optimal return on investment.

How the customer services is rendered [feedback system exist or not] CASELETSHEENASheena had worked for the same Fortune 500 Company for most 15 years. Although thecompany had gone through some tough times, things were starting to turn around. Customerorders were up, and quality and productivity had improved dramatically from what they had beenonly a few years earlier due company wide quality improvement program. So, it comes as a realshock to Sheena and about 400 of her co-workers when they were suddenly terminated followingthe new CEO’s decision to downsize the company. After recovering from the initial shock, Sheena tried to find employment elsewhere. Despiteher efforts, after eight months of searching she was no closer to finding a job than the day shestarted. Her funds were being depleted and she was getting more discouraged. There was onebright spot, though: She was able to bring in a little money by mowing lawns for her neighbors.She got involved quite by chance when she heard one neighbor remark that now that his childrenwere on their own, nobody was around to cut the grass. Almost jokingly, Sheena asked him howmuch he’d be willing to pay. Soon Sheena was mowing the lawns of five neighbors. Otherneighbors wanted her to work on their lawns, but she didn’t feel that she could spare any moretime from her job search. However, as the rejection letters began to pile up, Sheena knew she had to make animportant decision in her life. On a rainy Tuesday morning, she decided to go into business forherself taking care of neighborhood lawns. She was relieved to give up the stress of job hunting,and she was excited about the prospects of being her own boss. But she was also fearful of beingcompletely on her own. Nevertheless, Sheena was determined to make a go of it. At first, business was a little slow, but once people realized Sheena was available, manyasked her to take care of their lawns. Some people were simply glad to turn - the work overto her; others switched from professional lawn care services. By the end of her first year inbusiness, Sheena knew she could earn a living this way. She also performed other services suchas fertilizing lawns, weeding gardens, and trimming shrubbery. Business became so good thatSheena hired two part-time workers to assist her and, even then, she believed she could expandfurther if she wanted to.Questions 1. In what ways are Sheena’s customers most likely to judge the quality of her lawn care services? 2. Sheena is the operations manager of her business. Among her responsibilities are forecasting, inventory management, scheduling, quality assurance, and maintenance. INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT  (a) What kinds of things would likely require forecasts? (b) What inventory items does Sheena probably have? Name one inventory decision she has to make periodically. (c) What scheduling must she do? What things might occur to disrupt schedules and cause Sheena to reschedule? (d) How important is quality assurance to Sheena’s business? Explain. (e) What kinds of maintenance must be performed? 3. What are some of the trade-offs that Sheena probably considered relative to: (a) Working for a company instead of for herself? (b) Expanding the business? 4. The town is considering an ordinance that would prohibit putting grass clippings at the curb for pickup because local landfills cannot handle the volume. What options might Sheena consider if the ordinance is passed? Name two advantages and two drawbacks of each option.

The company employs over23,000 people, and has annual sales of over Rs. 2.0 billion. Wegmans has a strong reputation for offering its customers high product quality and excellentservice. Through a combination of market research, trial and error, and listening to its customers,Wegmans has evolved into a very successful organization. In fact, Wegmans is so good at whatit does that grocery chains all over the country send representatives to Wegmans for a firsthandlook at operations.SUPERSTORESMany of the company’s stores are giant 100,000 square foot superstores, double or triple the sizeof average supermarkets. A superstore typically employs from 500 to 600 people. Individual stores differ somewhat in terms of actual size and some special features. Asidefrom the features normally found in supermarkets, they generally have a large bakery Section(each store bakes its own bread, rolls, cakes, pies, and pastries), and extra large producesections. They also offer film processing a complete pharmacy, a card shop and video rentals.In-store floral shops range in size up to 800 square feet of space, and offer a wide variety offresh-cut flowers, flower arrangements, varies and plants. In-store card shops covers over 1000square feet of floor of floor space. The bulk foods department provides customers with theopportunity to select what quantities they desire from a vast array of foodstuffs and somenonfood items. Each store is a little different. Among the special features in some stores are a dry cleaningdepartment, a wokery, and a salad bar. Some feature a Market Cafe that has different foodstations, each devoted to preparing and serving a certain type of food. For example, one stationhas pizza and other Italian specialties, and another oriental food. There are also being a sandwichbar, a salad bar and a dessert station. Customers often wander among stations as they decide PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTwhat to order. In several affluent locations, customers can stop in on their way home from workand choose from a selection of freshly prepared dinner entrees. Some stores have a coffee shopsection with tables and chairs where shoppers can enjoy regular or specialty coffees and varietyof tempting pastries.PRODUCE DEPARTMENTThe company prides itself on fresh produce. Produce is replenished as often as 12 times a day.The larger stores have produce sections that are four to five times the size of a produce sectionof an average supermarket. Wegmans offers locally grown produce a season. Wegmans usesa ’farm to market’ system whereby some local growers deliver their produce directly to individualstores, bypassing the main warehouse. That reduces the company’s inventory holding costs andgets the produce into the stores as quickly as possible. Growers may use specially designedcontainers that go right onto the store floor instead of large bins. This avoids the bruising thatoften occurs when fruits and vegetables are transferred from bins to display shelves and the needto devote labor to transfer the produce to shelves.MEAT DEPARTMENTIn addition to large display cases of both fresh and frozen meat products, many stores have afull-service butcher shop that offers a variety of fresh meat products and where butchers areavailable to provide customized cuts of meat for customers.ORDERINGEach department handles its own ordering. Although sales records are available from records ofitems scanned at the checkouts, they are not used directly for replenishing stock. Other factors,such as pricing, special promotions, local circumstances must all be taken into account. However,for seasonal periods, such as holidays, managers often check scanner records to learn what pastdemand was during a comparable period. The superstores typically receive one truckload of goods per day from the main warehouse.During peak periods, a store may receive two truckloads from the main warehouse. The shortlead-time greatly reduce the length of the time an item might be out of stock, unless the mainwarehouse is also out of stock. The company exercises strict control over suppliers, insisting on product quality and on-timedeliveries.EMPLOYEESThe company recognises the value of good employees. It typically invests an average of Rs.7000to train each new employee. In addition to learning about stores operations, new employees learnthe importance of good customer service and how to provide it. The employees are helpful,cheerfully answering customer questions or handling complaints. Employees are motivated througha combination of compensation, profit sharing, and benefits.QUALITYQuality and Customer satisfaction are utmost in the minds of Wegmans management and itsemployees. Private label food items as well as name brands are regularly evaluated in testkitchens, along with the potential new products. Managers are responsible for checking and INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION AND OPERATION MANAGEMENT maintaining products and service quality in their departments. Moreover, employees are encouragedto report problems to their managers. If a customer is dissatisfied with an item and returns it, or even a portion of the item, thecustomer is offered a choice of a replacement or a refund. If the item is a Wegmans brand fooditem, it is then sent to the test kitchen to determine the cause of the problem. If the cause canbe determined, corrective action is taken.Questions 1. How do customers judge the quality of a supermarket? 2. Indicate how and why each of these factors is important to the successful operation of a supermarket: (a) Customer satisfaction. (b) Forecasting. (c) Capacity planning. (d) Location (e) Inventory management. (f) Layout of the store. (g) Scheduling.

One of the key features of a conversion process (manufacturingsystem) is the efficiency with which the products (services) are transferred to the customers.This fact will include the determination of where to place the plant or facility. The selection of location is a key-decision as large investment is made in building plant andmachinery. It is not advisable or not possible to change the location very often. So an improper locationof plant may lead to waste of all the investments made in building and machinery, equipment. Before a location for a plant is selected, long range forecasts should be made anticipatingfuture needs of the company. The plant location should be based on the company’s expansionplan and policy, diversification plan for the products, changing market conditions, the changingsources of raw materials and many other factors that influence the choice of the locationdecision. The purpose of the location study is to find an optimum location one that will result inthe greatest advantage to the organization. 2.2 NEED FOR SELECTING A SUITABLE LOCATIONThe need for selecting a suitable location arises because of three situations. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT ! I. When starting a new organisation, i.e., location choice for the first time. II. In case of existing organisation. III. In case of Global Location.I. In Case of Location Choice for the First Time or New Organisations Cost economies are always important while selecting a location for the first time, but shouldkeep in mind the cost of long-term business/organisational objectives. The following are thefactors to be considered while selecting the location for the new organisations: 1. Identification of region: The organisational objectives along with the various long-termconsiderations about marketing, technology, internal organisational strengths and weaknesses, region-specific resources and business environment, legal-governmental environment, social environmentand geographical environment suggest a suitable region for locating the operations facility. 2. Choice of a site within a region: Once the suitable region is identified, the next stepis choosing the best site from an available set. Choice of a site is less dependent on theorganisation’s long-term strategies. Evaluation of alternative sites for their tangible and intangiblecosts will resolve facilities-location problem. The problem of location of a site within the region can be approached with the followingcost-oriented non-interactive model, i.e., dimensional analysis. 3. Dimensional analysis: If all the costs were tangible and quantifiable, the comparison andselection of a site is easy. The location with the least cost is selected. In most of the casesintangible costs which are expressed in relative terms than in absolute terms. Their relative meritsand demerits of sites can also be compared easily. Since both tangible and intangible costs needto be considered for a selection of a site, dimensional analysis is used. Dimensional analysis consists in computing the relative merits (cost ratio) for each of thecost items for two alternative sites. For each of the ratios an appropriate weightage by meansof power is given and multiplying these weighted ratios to come up with a comprehensive figureon the relative merit of two alternative sites, i.e., C1M, C2M, …, CzM are the different costs associated with a site M on the ‘z’ different costitems. C1N, C2N, …, CzN are the different costs associated with a site N and W1, W2, W3, …, Wzare the weightage given to these cost items, then relative merit of the M and site N is given by: (C ) ( ) ( ) W1 W2 Wz M 1 N / C1 × C2 / C2 M N ,..., Cz / CN M z If this is&gt;1, site N is superior and vice-versa. When starting a new factory, plant location decisions are very important because they havedirect bearing on factors like, financial, employment and distribution patterns. In the long run,relocation of plant may even benefit the organization. But, the relocation of the plant involvesstoppage of production, and also cost for shifting the facilities to a new location. In addition tothese things, it will introduce some inconvenience in the normal functioning of the business.Hence, at the time of starting any industry, one should generate several alternate sites for locatingthe plant. After a critical analysis, the best site is to be selected for commissioning the plant.Location of warehouses and other facilities are also having direct bearing on the operationalperformance of organizations. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The existing firms will seek new locations in order to expand the capacity or to place theexisting facilities. When the demand for product increases, it will give rise to following decisions: l Whether to expand the existing capacity and facilities. l Whether to look for new locations for additional facilities. l Whether to close down existing facilities to take advantage of some new locations.II. In Case of Location Choice for Existing Organisation In this case a manufacturing plant has to fit into a multi-plant operations strategy. That is,additional plant location in the same premesis and elsewere under following circumstances: 1. Plant manufacturing distinct products. 2. Manufacturing plant supplying to specific market area. 3. Plant divided on the basis of the process or stages in manufacturing. 4. Plants emphasizing flexibility. The different operations strategies under the above circumstances could be: 1. Plants manufacturing distinct products: Each plant services the entire market area forthe organization. This strategy is necessary where the needs of technological and resource inputsare specialized or distinctively different for the different product-lines. For example, a high quality precision product-line should not be located along with otherproduct-line requiring little emphasis on precision. It may not be proper to have too manycontradictions such as sophisticated and old equipment, highly skilled and semi-skilled personnel,delicates processes and those that could permit rough handlings, all under one roof and one setof managers. Such a setting leads to much confusion regarding the required emphasis and themanagement policies. Product specialization may be necessary in a highly competitive market. It may be necessaryto exploit the special resources of a particular geographical area. The more decentralized thesepairs are in terms of the management and in terms of their physical location, the better wouldbe the planning and control and the utilization of the resources. 2. Manufacturing plants supplying to a specific market area: Here, each plantmanufactures almost all of the company’s products. This type of strategy is useful where marketproximity consideration dominates the resources and technology considerations. This strategyrequires great deal of coordination from the corporate office. An extreme example of thisstrategy is that of soft drinks bottling plants. 3. Plants divided on the basis of the process or stages in manufacturing: Eachproduction process or stage of manufacturing may require distinctively different equipmentcapabilities, labour skills, technologies, and managerial policies and emphasis. Since the productsof one plant feed into the other plant, this strategy requires much centralized coordination of themanufacturing activities from the corporate office that are expected to understand the varioustechnological aspects of all the plants. 4. Plants emphasizing flexibility: This requires much coordination between plants to meetthe changing needs and at the same time ensure efficient use of the facilities and resources.Frequent changes in the long-term strategy in order to improve be efficiently temporarily, are nothealthy for the organization. In any facility location problem the central question is: ‘Is this alocation at which the company can remain competitive for a long time?’ PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT # For an established organization in order to add on to the capacity, following are the ways: (a) Expansion of the facilities at the existing site: This is acceptable when it does notviolate the basic business and managerial outlines, i.e., philosophies, purposes, strategies andcapabilities. For example, expansion should not compromise quality, delivery, or customer service. (b) Relocation of the facilities (closing down the existing ones): This is a drastic stepwhich can be called as ‘Uprooting and Transplanting’. Unless there are very compelling reasons,relocation is not done. The reasons will be either bringing radical changes in technology, resourceavailability or other destabilization. All these factors are applicable to service organizations, whose objectives, priorities andstrategies may differ from those of hardcore manufacturing organizations.III. In Case of Global Location Because of globalisation, multinational corporations are setting up their organizations in Indiaand Indian companies are extending their operations in other countries. In case of global locationsthere is scope for virtual proximity and virtual factory.VIRTUAL PROXIMITYWith the advance in telecommunications technology, a firm can be in virtual proximity to itscustomers. For a software services firm much of its logistics is through the information/communication pathway. Many firms use the communications highway for conducting a largeportion of their business transactions. Logistics is certainly an important factor in deciding on alocation—whether in the home country or abroad. Markets have to be reached. Customers haveto be contacted. Hence, a market presence in the country of the customers is quite necessary.VIRTUAL FACTORYMany firms based in USA and UK in the service sector and in the manufacturing sector often outsources part of their business processes to foreign locations such as India. Thus, instead of one’sown operations, a firm could use its business associates’ operations facilities. The Indian BPO firmis a foreign-based company’s ‘virtual service factory’. So a location could be one’s own or one’sbusiness associates. The location decision need not always necessarily pertain to own operations.REASONS FOR A GLOBAL/FOREIGN LOCATIONA. Tangible Reasons The trangible reasons for setting up an operations facility abroad could be as follows: Reaching the customer: One obvious reason for locating a facility abroad is that ofcapturing a share of the market expanding worldwide. The phenomenal growth of the GDP ofIndia is a big reason for the multinationals to have their operations facilities in our country. Animportant reason is that of providing service to the customer promptly and economically whichis logistics-dependent. Therefore, cost and case of logistics is a reason for setting up manufacturingfacilities abroad. By logistics set of activities closes the gap between production of goods/servicesand reaching of these intended goods/services to the customer to his satisfaction. Reaching thecustomer is thus the main objective. The tangible and intangible gains and costs depend upon thecompany defining for itself as to what that ‘reaching’ means. The tangible costs could be thelogistics related costs; the intangible costs may be the risk of operating is a foreign country. The $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTtangible gains are the immediate gains; the intangible gains are an outcome of what the companydefines the concepts of reaching and customer for itself. The other tangible reasons could be as follows: (a) The host country may offer substantial tax advantages compared to the home country. (b) The costs of manufacturing and running operations may be substantially less in that foreign country. This may be due to lower labour costs, lower raw material cost, better availability of the inputs like materials, energy, water, ores, metals, key personnel etc. (c) The company may overcome the tariff barriers by setting up a manufacturing plant in a foreign country rather than exporting the items to that country.B. Intangible Reasons The intangible reasons for considering setting up an operations facility abroad could be asfollows: 1. Customer-related Reasons (a) With an operations facility in the foreign country, the firm’s customers may feel secure that the firm is more accessible. Accessibility is an important ‘service quality’ determinant. (b) The firm may be able to give a personal tough. (c) The firm may interact more intimately with its customers and may thus understand their requirements better. (d) It may also discover other potential customers in the foreign location. 2. Organisational Learning-related Reasons (a) The firm can learn advanced technology. For example, it is possible that cutting-edge technologies can be learn by having operations in an technologically more advanced country. The firm can learn from advanced research laboratories/universities in that country. Such learning may help the entire product-line of the company. (b) The firm can learn from its customers abroad. A physical location there may be essential towards this goal. (c) It can also learn from its competitors operating in that country. For this reason, it may have to be physically present where the action is. (d) The firm may also learn from its suppliers abroad. If the firm has a manufacturing plant there, it will have intensive interaction with the suppliers in that country from whom there may be much to learn in terms of modern and appropriate technology, modern management methods, and new trends in business worldwide. 3. Other Strategic Reasons (a) The firm by being physically present in the host country may gain some ‘local boy’ kind of psychological advantage. The firm is no more a ‘foreign’ company just sending its products across international borders. This may help the firm in lobbying with the government of that country and with the business associations in that country. (b) The firm may avoid ‘political risk’ by having operations in multiple countries. (c) By being in the foreign country, the firm can build alternative sources of supply. The firm could, thus, reduce its supply risks. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT % (d) The firm could hunt for human capital in different countries by having operations in those countries. Thus, the firm can gather the best of people from across the globe. (e) Foreign locations in addition to the domestic locations would lower the market risks for the firm. If one market goes slow the other may be doing well, thus lowering the overall risk. 2.3 FACTORS INFLUENCING PLANT LOCATION/FACILITY LOCATIONFacility location is the process of determining a geographic site for a firm’s operations. Managersof both service and manufacturing organizations must weigh many factors when assessing thedesirability of a particular site, including proximity to customers and suppliers, labour costs, andtransportation costs. Location conditions are complex and each comprises a different Characteristic of a tangible(i.e. Freight rates, production costs) and non-tangible (i.e. reliability, Frequency security, quality)nature. Location conditions are hard to measure. Tangible cost based factors such as wages andproducts costs can be quantified precisely into what makes locations better to compare. On theother hand non-tangible features, which refer to such characteristics as reliability, availability andsecurity, can only be measured along an ordinal or even nominal scale. Other non-tangiblefeatures like the percentage of employees that are unionized can be measured as well. To sumthis up non-tangible features are very important for business location decisions. It is appropriate to divide the factors, which influence the plant location or facility locationon the basis of the nature of the organisation as 1. General locational factors, which include controllable and uncontrollable factors for all type of organisations. 2. Specific locational factors specifically required for manufacturing and service organisations. Location factors can be further divided into two categories: Dominant factors are those derived from competitive priorities (cost, quality, time, andflexibility) and have a particularly strong impact on sales or costs. Secondary factors also areimportant, but management may downplay or even ignore some of them if other factors are moreimportant.2.3.1 General Locational FactorsFollowing are the general factors required for location of plant in case of all types of organisations.CONTROLLABLE FACTORS 1. Proximity to markets 2. Supply of materials 3. Transportation facilities 4. Infrastructure availability 5. Labour and wages &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTFig. 2.1 Factors influencing plant location. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT 6. External economies 7. CapitalUNCONTROLLABLE FACTORS 8. Government policy 9. Climate conditions 10. Supporting industries and services 11. Community and labour attitudes 12. Community InfrastructureCONTROLLABLE FACTORS 1. Proximity to markets: Every company is expected to serve its customers by providinggoods and services at the time needed and at reasonable price organizations may choose to locatefacilities close to the market or away from the market depending upon the product. When thebuyers for the product are concentrated, it is advisable to locate the facilities close to the market. Locating nearer to the market is preferred if • The products are delicate and susceptible to spoilage. • After sales services are promptly required very often. • Transportation cost is high and increase the cost significantly. • Shelf life of the product is low. Nearness to the market ensures a consistent supply of goods to customers and reduces thecost of transportation. 2. Supply of raw material: It is essential for the organization to get raw material in rightqualities and time in order to have an uninterrupted production. This factor becomes very importantif the materials are perishable and cost of transportation is very high. General guidelines suggested by Yaseen regarding effects of raw materials on plant locationare: • When a single raw material is used without loss of weight, locate the plant at the raw material source, at the market or at any point in between. • When weight loosing raw material is demanded, locate the plant at the raw material source. • When raw material is universally available, locate close to the market area. • If the raw materials are processed from variety of locations, the plant may be situated so as to minimize total transportation costs. Nearness to raw material is important in case of industries such as sugar, cement, jute andcotton textiles. 3. Transportation facilities: Speedy transport facilities ensure timely supply of raw materialsto the company and finished goods to the customers. The transport facility is a prerequisite for ! PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTthe location of the plant. There are five basic modes of physical transportation, air, road, rail,water and pipeline. Goods that are mainly intended for exports demand a location near to the portor large airport. The choice of transport method and hence the location will depend on relativecosts, convenience, and suitability. Thus transportation cost to value added is one of the criteriafor plant location. 4. Infrastructure availability: The basic infrastructure facilities like power, water andwaste disposal, etc., become the prominent factors in deciding the location. Certain types ofindustries are power hungry e.g., aluminum and steel and they should be located close to thepower station or location where uninterrupted power supply is assured throughout the year. Thenon-availability of power may become a survival problem for such industries. Process industrieslike paper, chemical, cement, etc., require continuous. Supply of water in large amount and goodquality, and mineral content of water becomes an important factor. A waste disposal facility forprocess industries is an important factor, which influences the plant location. 5. Labour and wages: The problem of securing adequate number of labour and with skillsspecific is a factor to be considered both at territorial as well as at community level during plantlocation. Importing labour is usually costly and involve administrative problem. The history oflabour relations in a prospective community is to be studied. Prospective community is to bestudied. Productivity of labour is also an important factor to be considered. Prevailing wagepattern, cost of living and industrial relation and bargaining power of the unions’ forms inimportant considerations. 6. External economies of scale: External economies of scale can be described asurbanization and locational economies of scale. It refers to advantages of a company by settingup operations in a large city while the second one refers to the “settling down” among othercompanies of related Industries. In the case of urbanization economies, firms derive from locatingin larger cities rather than in smaller ones in a search of having access to a large pool of labour,transport facilities, and as well to increase their markets for selling their products and haveaccess to a much wider range of business services. Location economies of scale in the manufacturing sector have evolved over time and havemainly increased competition due to production facilities and lower production costs as a resultof lower transportation and logistical costs. This led to manufacturing districts where manycompanies of related industries are located more or less in the same area. As large corporationshave realized that inventories and warehouses have become a major cost factor, they have triedreducing inventory costs by launching “Just in Time” production system (the so called KanbanSystem). This high efficient production system was one main factor in the Japanese car industryfor being so successful. Just in time ensures to get spare parts from suppliers within just a fewhours after ordering. To fulfill these criteria corporations have to be located in the same areaincreasing their market and service for large corporations. 7. Capital: By looking at capital as a location condition, it is important to distinguish thephysiology of fixed capital in buildings and equipment from financial capital. Fixed capital costsas building and construction costs vary from region to region. But on the other hand buildings canalso be rented and existing plants can be expanded. Financial capital is highly mobile and doesnot very much influence decisions. For example, large Multinational Corporations such as Coca- PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT !Cola operate in many different countries and can raise capital where interest rates are lowestand conditions are most suitable. Capital becomes a main factor when it comes to venture capital. In that case young, fastgrowing (or not) high tech firms are concerned which usually have not many fixed assets. Thesefirms particularly need access to financial capital and also skilled educated employees.UNCONTROLLABLE FACTORS 8. Government policy: The policies of the state governments and local bodies concerninglabour laws, building codes, safety, etc., are the factors that demand attention. In order to have a balanced regional growth of industries, both central and state governmentsin our country offer the package of incentives to entrepreneurs in particular locations. Theincentive package may be in the form of exemption from a safes tax and excise duties for aspecific period, soft loan from financial institutions, subsidy in electricity charges and investmentsubsidy. Some of these incentives may tempt to locate the plant to avail these facilities offered. 9. Climatic conditions: The geology of the area needs to be considered together withclimatic conditions (humidity, temperature). Climates greatly influence human efficiency andbehaviour. Some industries require specific climatic conditions e.g., textile mill will require humidity. 10. Supporting industries and services: Now a day the manufacturing organisationwill not make all the components and parts by itself and it subcontracts the work to vendors.So, the source of supply of component parts will be the one of the factors that influences thelocation. The various services like communications, banking services professional consultancy servicesand other civil amenities services will play a vital role in selection of a location. 11. Community and labour attitudes: Community attitude towards their work and towardsthe prospective industries can make or mar the industry. Community attitudes towards supportingtrade union activities are important criteria. Facility location in specific location is not desirableeven though all factors are favouring because of labour attitude towards management, whichbrings very often the strikes and lockouts. 12. Community infrastructure and amenity: All manufacturing activities require accessto a community infrastructure, most notably economic overhead capital, such as roads, railways,port facilities, power lines and service facilities and social overhead capital like schools, universitiesand hospitals. These factors are also needed to be considered by location decisions as infrastructure isenormously expensive to build and for most manufacturing activities the existing stock ofinfrastructure provides physical restrictions on location possibilities.2.3.2 Specific Locational Factors for Manufacturing OrganisationDOMINANT FACTORSFactors dominating location decisions for new manufacturing plants can be broadly classified insix groups. They are listed in the order of their importance as follows. ! PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 1. Favourable labour climate 2. Proximity to markets 3. Quality of life 4. Proximity to suppliers and resources 5. Utilities, taxes, and real estate costs 1. Favorable labour climate: A favorable labour climate may be the most important factorin location decisions for labour-intensive firms in industries such as textiles, furniture, and consumerelectronics. Labour climate includes wage rates, training requirements, attitudes toward work,worker productivity, and union strength. Many executives consider weak unions or al low probabilityof union organizing efforts as a distinct advantage. 2. Proximity to markets: After determining where the demand for goods and services isgreatest, management must select a location for the facility that will supply that demand. Locatingnear markets is particularly important when the final goods are bulky or heavy and outboundtransportation rates are high. For example, manufacturers of products such as plastic pipe andheavy metals all emphasize proximity to their markets. 3. Quality of life: Good schools, recreational facilities, cultural events, and an attractivelifestyle contribute to quality of life. This factor is relatively unimportant on its own, but it canmake the difference in location decisions. 4. Proximity to suppliers and resources: In many companies, plants supply parts to otherfacilities or rely on other facilities for management and staff support. These require frequentcoordination and communication, which can become more difficult as distance increases. 5. Utilities, taxes, and real estate costs: Other important factors that may emergeinclude utility costs (telephone, energy, and water), local and state taxes, financing incentivesoffered by local or state governments, relocation costs, and land costs.SECONDARY FACTORSThere are some other factors needed to be considered, including room for expansion, constructioncosts, accessibility to multiple modes of transportation, the cost of shuffling people and materialsbetween plants, competition from other firms for the workforce, community attitudes, and manyothers. For global operations, firms are emphasizing local employee skills and education and thelocal infrastructure.2.3.3 Specific Locational Factors for Service OrganisationDOMINANT FACTORSThe factors considered for manufacturers are also applied to service providers, with one importantaddition — the impact of location on sales and customer satisfaction. Customers usually lookabout how close a service facility is, particularly if the process requires considerable customercontact. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT !!PROXIMITY TO CUSTOMERSLocation is a key factor in determining how conveniently customers can carry on business witha firm. For example, few people would like to go to remotely located dry cleaner or supermarketif another is more convenient. Thus the influence of location on revenues tends to be thedominant factor.TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND PROXIMITY TO MARKETSFor warehousing and distribution operations, transportation costs and proximity to markets areextremely important. With a warehouse nearby, many firms can hold inventory closer to thecustomer, thus reducing delivery time and promoting sales.LOCATION OF COMPETITORSOne complication in estimating the sales potential at different location is the impact of competitors.Management must not only consider the current location of competitors but also try to anticipatetheir reaction to the firm’s new location. Avoiding areas where competitors are already wellestablished often pays. However, in some industries, such as new-car sales showrooms and fast-food chains, locating near competitors is actually advantageous. The strategy is to create acritical mass, whereby several competing firms clustered in one location attract more customersthan the total number who would shop at the same stores at scattered locations. Recognizing thiseffect, some firms use a follow –the leader strategy when selecting new sites.SECONDARY FACTORSRetailers also must consider the level of retail activity, residential density, traffic flow, and sitevisibility. Retail activity in the area is important, as shoppers often decide on impulse to goshopping or to eat in a restaurant. Traffic flows and visibility are important because businesses’customers arrive in cars. Visibility involves distance from the street and size of nearby buildingsand signs. High residential density ensures nighttime and weekend business when the populationin the area fits the firm’s competitive priorities and target market segment. 2.4 LOCATION THEORIESALFRED WEBER’S THEORY OF THE LOCATION OF INDUSTRIESAlfred Weber (1868–1958), with the publication of Theory of the Location of Industries in 1909, putforth the first developed general theory of industrial location. His model took into account severalspatial factors for finding the optimal location and minimal cost for manufacturing plants. The point for locating an industry that minimizes costs of transportation and labour requiresanalysis of three factors: 1. The point of optimal transportation based on the costs of distance to the ‘material index’—the ratio of weight to intermediate products (raw materials) to finished product. 2. The labour distortion, in which more favourable sources of lower cost of labour may justify greater transport distances. 3. Agglomeration and degglomerating. !&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Agglomeration or concentration of firms in a locale occurs when there is sufficientdemand for support services for the company and labour force, including new investments inschools and hospitals. Also supporting companies, such as facilities that build and service machinesand financial services, prefer closer contact with their customers. Degglommeration occurs when companies and services leave because of over concentrationof industries or of the wrong types of industries, or shortages of labour, capital, affordable land,etc. Weber also examined factors leading to the diversification of an industry in the horizontalrelations between processes within the plant. The issue of industry location is increasingly relevant to today’s global markets and trans-national corporations. Focusing only on the mechanics of the Weberian model could justifygreater transport distances for cheap labour and unexploited raw materials. When resources areexhausted or workers revolt, industries move to different countries. 2.5 LOCATION MODELSVarious models are available which help to identify the ideal location. Some of the popular modelsare: 1. Factor rating method 2. Weighted factor rating method 3. Load-distance method 4. Centre of gravity method 5. Break even analysis2.5.1 Factor Rating MethodThe process of selecting a new facility location involves a series of following steps: 1. Identify the important location factors. 2. Rate each factor according to its relative importance, i.e., higher the ratings is indicative of prominent factor. 3. Assign each location according to the merits of the location for each factor. 4. Calculate the rating for each location by multiplying factor assigned to each location with basic factors considered. 5. Find the sum of product calculated for each factor and select best location having highest total score. ILLUSTRATION 1: Let us assume that a new medical facility, Health-care, is to belocated in Delhi. The location factors, factor rating and scores for two potential sites areshown in the following table. Which is the best location based on factor rating method? PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT !# Sl. No. Location factor Factor Rating rating Location 1 Location 2 1. Facility utilization 8 3 5 2. Total patient per month 5 4 3 3. Average time per emergency trip 6 4 5 4. Land and construction costs 3 1 2 5. Employee preferences 5 5 3 SOLUTION: Sl. No. Location Factor Location 1 Location 2 factor rating (Rating) Total= (Rating) Total (1) (2) (1) . (2) (3) = (1) . (3) 1. Facility utilization 8 3 24 5 40 2. Total patient per 5 4 20 3 15 month 3. Average time per 6 4 24 5 30 emergency trip 4. Land and 3 1 3 2 6 construction costs 5. Employee 5 5 25 3 15 preferences Total 96 Total 106 The total score for location 2 is higher than that of location 1. Hence location 2, is the bestchoice.2.5.2Weighted Factor Rating MethodIn this method to merge quantitative and qualitative factors, factors are assigned weights basedon relative importance and weightage score for each site using a preference matrix is calculated.The site with the highest weighted score is selected as the best choice. ILLUSTRATION 2: Let us assume that a new medical facility, Health-care, is to belocated in Delhi. The location factors, weights, and scores (1 = poor, 5 = excellent) fortwo potential sites are shown in the following table. What is the weighted score for thesesites? Which is the best location? Sl. No. Location factor Weight Scores Location 1 Location 2 1. Facility utilization 25 3 5 2. Total patient km per month 25 4 3 3. Average time per emergency trip 25 3 3 4. Land and construction costs 15 1 2 5. Employee preferences 10 5 3 !$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SOLUTION: The weighted score for this particular site is calculated by multiplying eachfactor’s weight by its score and adding the results: Weighed score location 1 = 25 × 3 + 25 × 4 + 25 × 3 + 15 × 1 + 10 × 5 = 75 + 100 + 75 + 15 + 50 = 315 Weighed score location 2 = 25 × 5 + 25 × 3 + 25 × 3 + 15 × 2 + 10 × 3 = 125 + 75 + 75 + 30 + 30 = 335 Location 2 is the best site based on total weighted scores.2.5.3Load-distance MethodThe load-distance method is a mathematical model used to evaluate locations based on proximityfactors. The objective is to select a location that minimizes the total weighted loads moving intoand out of the facility. The distance between two points is expressed by assigning the points togrid coordinates on a map. An alternative approach is to use time rather than distance.DISTANCE MEASURESSuppose that a new warehouse is to be located to serve Delhi. It will receive inbound shipmentsfrom several suppliers, including one in Ghaziabad. If the new warehouse were located atGurgaon, what would be the distance between the two facilities? If shipments travel by truck,the distance depends on the highway system and the specific route taken. Computer softwareis available for calculating the actual mileage between any two locations in the same county.However, for load-distance method, a rough calculation that is either Euclidean or rectilineardistance measure may be used. Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance, or shortestpossible path, between two points. Fig. 2.2 Distance between point A and point B The point A on the grid represents the supplier’s location in Ghaziabad, and the point Brepresents the possible warehouse location at Gurgaon. The distance between points A and Bis the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, or dAB = Sqrt ((XA – XB)2 + (YA – YB)2)where dAB = distance between points A and B XA = x-coordinate of point A YA = y-coordinate of point A XB = x-coordinate of point B YB = y-coordinate of point B PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT !% Rectilinear distance measures distance between two points with a series of 90° turns as cityblocks. Essentially, this distance is the sum of the two dashed lines representing the base and sideof the triangle in figure. The distance travelled in the x-direction is the absolute value of thedifference in x-coordinates. Adding this result to the absolute value of the difference in they-coordinates gives DAB = |XA – XB| + |YA – YB|CALCULATING A LOAD-DISTANCE SCORESuppose that a firm planning a new location wants to select a site that minimizes the distancesthat loads, particularly the larger ones, must travel to and from the site. Depending on theindustry, a load may be shipments from suppliers, between plants, or to customers, or it may becustomers or employees travelling to or from the facility. The firm seeks to minimize its load-distance, generally by choosing a location so that large loads go short distances. To calculate a load-distance for any potential location, we use either of the distance measuresand simply multiply the loads flowing to and from the facility by the distances travelled. Theseloads may be expressed as tones or number of trips per week. This calls for a practical example to appreciate the relevance of the concept. Let us visita new Health-care facility, once again. ILLUSTRATION 3: The new Health-care facility is targeted to serve seven censustracts in Delhi. The table given below shows the coordinates for the centre of each censustract, along with the projected populations, measured in thousands. Customers will travelfrom the seven census tract centres to the new facility when they need health-care. Twolocations being considered for the new facility are at (5.5, 4.5) and (7, 2), which are thecentres of census tracts C and F. Details of seven census tract centres, co-ordinate distancesalong with the population for each centre are given below. If we use the population as theloads and use rectilinear distance, which location is better in terms of its total load-distance score? Sl. No. Census tract (x, y) Population (l) 1 A (2.5, 4.5) 2 2 B (2.5, 2.5) 5 3 C (5.5, 4.5) 10 4 D (5, 2) 7 5 E (8, 5) 10 6 F (7, 2) 20 7 G (9, 2.5) 14 SOLUTION: Calculate the load-distance score for each location. Using the coordinatesfrom the above table. Calculate the load-distance score for each tract. Using the formula DAB = |XA – XB| + |YA – YB| !&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Census (x, y) Population Locate at (5.5, 4.5) Locate at (7, 2) tract (l) Distance (d) Load- Distance (d) Load- distance distance A (2.5, 4.5) 2 3+0=3 6 4.5 + 2.5 = 7 14 B (2.5, 2.5) 5 3+2=5 25 4.5 + 0.5 = 5 25 C (5.5, 4.5) 10 0+0=0 0 1.5 + 2.5 = 4 40 D (5, 2) 7 0.5 + 2.5 = 3 21 2+0=2 14 E (8, 5) 10 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 30 1+3=4 40 F (7, 2) 20 1.5 + 2.5 = 4 80 0+0=0 0 G (9, 2.5) 14 3.5 + 2 = 5.5 77 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 35 Total 239 Total 168 Summing the scores for all tracts gives a total load-distance score of 239 when the facilityis located at (5.5, 4.5) versus a load-distance score of 168 at location (7, 2). Therefore, thelocation in census tract F is a better location.2.5.4 Centre of GravityCentre of gravity is based primarily on cost considerations. This method can be used to assistmanagers in balancing cost and service objectives. The centre of gravity method takes intoaccount the locations of plants and markets, the volume of goods moved, and transportation costsin arriving at the best location for a single intermediate warehouse. The centre of gravity is defined to be the location that minimizes the weighted distancebetween the warehouse and its supply and distribution points, where the distance is weightedby the number of tones supplied or consumed. The first step in this procedure is to placethe locations on a coordinate system. The origin of the coordinate system and scale used arearbitrary, just as long as the relative distances are correctly represented. This can be easily doneby placing a grid over an ordinary map. The centre of gravity is determined by the formula. ∑ Dix .Wi ∑ Diy .Wi CX = ∑ W i CY = ∑ W iwhere Cx = x-coordinate of the centre of gravity Cy = y-coordinate of the centre of gravity Dix = x-coordinate of location i Diy = y-coordinate of location i ILLUSTRATION 4: The new Health-care facility is targeted to serve seven censustracts in Delhi.

Using the centre of gravity as starting point, managerscan now search in its vicinity for the optimal location.2.5.5 Break Even AnalysisBreak even analysis implies that at some point in the operations, total revenue equals total cost.Break even analysis is concerned with finding the point at which revenues and costs agreeexactly. It is called ‘Break-even Point’. The Fig. 2.3 portrays the Break Even Chart: Break even point is the volume of output at which neither a profit is made nor a loss is incurred. The Break Even Point (BEP) in units can be calculated by using the relation: Fixed Cost Fixed Cost F BEP = = = units Contribution per unit Selling Price - Variable Cost per unit S - V The Break Even Point (BEP) in Rs. can be calulated by using the relation: Fixed Cost Fixed Cost F BEP = = = Rs.

From the graph (Fig. 2.4) we can interpret that location X is suitable up to 100,000 units,location Y is suitable up to between 100,000 to 300,000 units and location Z is suitable if thedemand is more than 300,000 units.

The various costs whichdecide locational economy are those of land, building, equipment, labour, material, etc. Other factorslike community attitude, community facilities and housing facilities will also influence the selectionof best location. Economic analysis is carried out to decide as to which locate best location. The following illustration will clarify the method of evaluation of best layout selection.

It is the configuration ofdepartments, work centres and equipment in the conversion process. It is a floor plan of thephysical facilities, which are used in production. According to Moore “Plant layout is a plan of an optimum arrangement of facilities includingpersonnel, operating equipment, storage space, material handling equipment and all othersupporting services along with the design of best structure to contain all these facilities”.2.7.1 Objectives of Plant LayoutThe primary goal of the plant layout is to maximise the profit by arrangement of all the plantfacilities to the best advantage of total manufacturing of the product. The objectives of plant layout are: 1. Streamline the flow of materials through the plant. 2. Facilitate the manufacturing process. 3. Maintain high turnover of in-process inventory. 4. Minimise materials handling and cost. 5. Effective utilisation of men, equipment and space. 6. Make effective utilisation of cubic space. 7. Flexibility of manufacturing operations and arrangements. 8. Provide for employee convenience, safety and comfort. 9. Minimize investment in equipment. 10. Minimize overall production time. 11. Maintain flexibility of arrangement and operation. 12. Facilitate the organizational structure. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT&quot;!2.7.2 Principles of Plant Layout 1. Principle of integration: A good layout is one that integrates men, materials, machinesand supporting services and others in order to get the optimum utilisation of resources andmaximum effectiveness. 2. Principle of minimum distance: This principle is concerned with the minimum travel(or movement) of man and materials. The facilities should be arranged such that, the totaldistance travelled by the men and materials should be minimum and as far as possible straightline movement should be preferred. 3. Principle of cubic space utilisation: The good layout is one that utilise both horizontaland vertical space. It is not only enough if only the floor space is utilised optimally but the thirddimension, i.e., the height is also to be utilised effectively. 4. Principle of flow: A good layout is one that makes the materials to move in forwarddirection towards the completion stage, i.e., there should not be any backtracking. 5. Principle of maximum flexibility: The good layout is one that can be altered withoutmuch cost and time, i.e., future requirements should be taken into account while designing thepresent layout. 6. Principle of safety, security and satisfaction: A good layout is one that gives dueconsideration to workers safety and satisfaction and safeguards the plant and machinery againstfire, theft, etc. 7. Principle of minimum handling: A good layout is one that reduces the material handlingto the minimum. 2.8 CLASSIFICATION OF LAYOUT Layouts can be classified into the following five categories: 1. Process layout 2. Product layout 3. Combination layout 4. Fixed position layout 5. Group layout2.8.1 Process LayoutProcess layout is recommended for batch production. All machines performing similar type ofoperations are grouped at one location in the process layout e.g., all lathes, milling machines, etc.are grouped in the shop will be clustered in like groups. Thus, in process layout the arrangement of facilities are grouped together according to theirfunctions. A typical process layout is shown in Fig. 2.5. The flow paths of material through thefacilities from one functional area to another vary from product to product. Usually the paths arelong and there will be possibility of backtracking. Process layout is normally used when the production volume is not sufficient to justify aproduct layout. Typically, job shops employ process layouts due to the variety of productsmanufactured and their low production volumes. &quot;&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Fig. 2.5 Process layoutAdvantages 1. In process layout machines are better utilized and fewer machines are required. 2. Flexibility of equipment and personnel is possible in process layout. 3. Lower investment on account of comparatively less number of machines and lower cost of general purpose machines. 4. Higher utilisation of production facilities. 5. A high degree of flexibility with regards to work distribution to machineries and workers. 6. The diversity of tasks and variety of job makes the job challenging and interesting. 7. Supervisors will become highly knowledgeable about the functions under their department.Limitations 1. Backtracking and long movements may occur in the handling of materials thus, reducing material handling efficiency. 2. Material handling cannot be mechanised which adds to cost. 3. Process time is prolonged which reduce the inventory turnover and increases the in- process inventory. 4. Lowered productivity due to number of set-ups. 5. Throughput (time gap between in and out in the process) time is longer. 6. Space and capital are tied up by work-in-process.2.8.2 Product LayoutIn this type of layout, machines and auxiliary services are located according to the processingsequence of the product. If the volume of production of one or more products is large, thefacilities can be arranged to achieve efficient flow of materials and lower cost per unit. Specialpurpose machines are used which perform the required function quickly and reliably. The product layout is selected when the volume of production of a product is high such thata separate production line to manufacture it can be justified. In a strict product layout, machinesare not shared by different products. Therefore, the production volume must be sufficient toachieve satisfactory utilisation of the equipment. A typical product layout is shown in Fig. 2.6. Fig. 2.6 Product layout PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT&quot;#Advantages 1. The flow of product will be smooth and logical in flow lines. 2. In-process inventory is less. 3. Throughput time is less. 4. Minimum material handling cost. 5. Simplified production, planning and control systems are possible. 6. Less space is occupied by work transit and for temporary storage. 7. Reduced material handling cost due to mechanised handling systems and straight flow. 8. Perfect line balancing which eliminates bottlenecks and idle capacity. 9. Manufacturing cycle is short due to uninterrupted flow of materials. 10. Small amount of work-in-process inventory. 11. Unskilled workers can learn and manage the production.Limitations 1. A breakdown of one machine in a product line may cause stoppages of machines in the downstream of the line. 2. A change in product design may require major alterations in the layout. 3. The line output is decided by the bottleneck machine. 4. Comparatively high investment in equipments is required. 5. Lack of flexibility. A change in product may require the facility modification.2.8.3 Combination LayoutA combination of process and product layouts combines the advantages of both types of layouts.A combination layout is possible where an item is being made in different types and sizes. Heremachinery is arranged in a process layout but the process grouping is then arranged in a sequenceto manufacture various types and sizes of products. It is to be noted that the sequence ofoperations remains same with the variety of products and sizes. Figure 2.7 shows a combinationtype of layout for manufacturing different sized gears. Fig. 2.7 Combination layout for making different types and sizes of gears &quot;$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT2.8.4 Fixed Position LayoutThis is also called the project type of layout. In this type of layout, the material, or majorcomponents remain in a fixed location and tools, machinery, men and other materials are broughtto this location. This type of layout is suitable when one or a few pieces of identical heavyproducts are to be manufactured and when the assembly consists of large number of heavy parts,the cost of transportation of these parts is very high. Fig. 2.8 Fixed position layoutAdvantages The major advantages of this type of layout are: 1. Helps in job enlargement and upgrades the skills of the operators. 2. The workers identify themselves with a product in which they take interest and pride in doing the job. 3. Greater flexibility with this type of layout. 4. Layout capital investment is lower.2.8.5 Group Layout (or Cellular Layout)There is a trend now to bring an element of flexibility into manufacturing system as regardsto variation in batch sizes and sequence of operations. A grouping of equipment for performinga sequence of operations on family of similar components or products has become all theimportant. Group technology (GT) is the analysis and comparisons of items to group them intofamilies with similar characteristics. GT can be used to develop a hybrid between pure processlayout and pure flow line (product) layout. This technique is very useful for companies thatproduce variety of parts in small batches to enable them to take advantage and economics offlow line layout. The application of group technology involves two basic steps; first step is to determinecomponent families or groups. The second step in applying group technology is to arrange theplants equipment used to process a particular family of components. This represents small plantswithin the plants. The group technology reduces production planning time for jobs. It reduces theset-up time. Thus group layout is a combination of the product layout and process layout. It combinesthe advantages of both layout systems. If there are m-machines and n-components, in a grouplayout (Group-Technology Layout), the m-machines and n-components will be divided into distinct PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT&quot;%number of machine-component cells (group) such that all the components assigned to a cell arealmost processed within that cell itself. Here, the objective is to minimize the intercell movements. The basic aim of a group technology layout is to identify families of components that requiresimilar of satisfying all the requirements of the machines are grouped into cells. Each cell iscapable of satisfying all the requirements of the component family assigned to it. The layout design process considers mostly a single objective while designing layouts. Inprocess layout, the objective is to minimize the total cost of materials handling. Because of thenature of the layout, the cost of equipments will be the minimum in this type of layout. In productlayout, the cost of materials handling will be at the absolute minimum. But the cost of equipmentswould not be at the minimum if the equipments are not fully utilized. In-group technology layout, the objective is to minimize the sum of the cost of transportationand the cost of equipments. So, this is called as multi-objective layout. A typical process layoutis shown in Fig. 2.9. Fig. 2.9 Group layout or Cellular layoutAdvantages of Group Technology Layout Group Technology layout can increase— 1. Component standardization and rationalization. 2. Reliability of estimates. 3. Effective machine operation and productivity. 4. Customer service. It can decrease the— 1. Paper work and overall production time. 2. Work-in-progress and work movement. 3. Overall cost. &quot;&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTLimitations of Group Technology Layout This type of layout may not be feasible for all situations. If the product mix is completelydissimilar, then we may not have meaningful cell formation. 2.9 DESIGN OF PRODUCT LAYOUTIn product layout, equipment or departments are dedicated to a particular product line, duplicateequipment is employed to avoid backtracking, and a straight-line flow of material movement isachievable. Adopting a product layout makes sense when the batch size of a given product orpart is large relative to the number of different products or parts produced. Assembly lines are a special case of product layout. In a general sense, the term assemblyline refers to progressive assembly linked by some material-handling device. The usual assumptionis that some form of pacing is present and the allowable processing time is equivalent for allworkstations. Within this broad definition, there are important differences among line types. Afew of these are material handling devices (belt or roller conveyor, overhead crane); lineconfiguration (U-shape, straight, branching); pacing (mechanical, human); product mix (one productor multiple products); workstation characteristics (workers may sit, stand, walk with the line, orride the line); and length of the line (few or many workers). The range of products partially orcompletely assembled on lines includes toys, appliances, autos, clothing and a wide variety ofelectronic components. In fact, virtually any product that has multiple parts and is produced inlarge volume uses assembly lines to some degree. A more-challenging problem is the determination of the optimum configuration of operatorsand buffers in a production flow process. A major design consideration in production lines is theassignment of operation so that all stages are more or less equally loaded. Consider the case oftraditional assembly lines illustrated in Fig. 2.10. Fig. 2.10 Traditional assembly line In this example, parts move along a conveyor at a rate of one part per minute to threegroups of workstations. The first operation requires 3 minutes per unit; the second operationrequires 1 minute per unit; and the third requires 2 minutes per unit. The first workstation consistsof three operators; the second, one operator; and the third, two operators. An operator removesa part from the conveyor and performs some assembly task at his or her workstation. Thecompleted part is returned to the conveyor and transported to the next operation. The numberof operators at each workstation was chosen so that the line is balanced. Since three operatorswork simultaneously at the first workstation, on the average one part will be completed each PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT&quot;minute. This is also true for other two stations. Since the parts arrive at a rate of one per minute,parts are also completed at this rate. Assembly-line systems work well when there is a low variance in the times required toperform the individual subassemblies. If the tasks are somewhat complex, thus resulting in ahigher assembly-time variance, operators down the line may not be able to keep up with the flowof parts from the preceding workstation or may experience excessive idle time. An alternativeto a conveyor-paced assembly-line is a sequence of workstations linked by gravity conveyors,which act as buffers between successive operations.LINE BALANCINGAssembly-line balancing often has implications for layout. This would occur when, for balancepurposes, workstation size or the number used would have to be physically modified. The most common assembly-line is a moving conveyor that passes a series of workstationsin a uniform time interval called the workstation cycle time (which is also the time betweensuccessive units coming off the end of the line). At each workstation, work is performed on aproduct either by adding parts or by completing assembly operations. The work performed ateach station is made up of many bits of work, termed tasks, elements, and work units. Such tasksare described by motion-time analysis. Generally, they are grouping that cannot be subdivided onthe assembly-line without paying a penalty in extra motions. The total work to be performed at a workstation is equal to the sum of the tasks assignedto that workstation. The line-balancing problem is one of assigning all tasks to a series ofworkstations so that each workstation has no more than can be done in the workstation cycletime, and so that the unassigned (idle) time across all workstations is minimized. The problem is complicated by the relationships among tasks imposed by product design andprocess technologies. This is called the precedence relationship, which specifies the order inwhich tasks must be performed in the assembly process. The steps in balancing an assembly line are: 1. Specify the sequential relationships among tasks using a precedence diagram. 2. Determine the required workstation cycle time C, using the formula Production time per day C = Required output per day (in units) 3. Determine the theoretical minimum number of workstations (Nt) required to satisfy the workstation cycle time constraint using the formula Sum of task times (T) Nt = Cycle time (C) 4. Select a primary rule by which tasks are to be assigned to workstations, and a secondary rule to break ties. 5. Assign tasks, one at a time, to the first workstation until the sum of the task times is equal to the workstation cycle time, or no other tasks are feasible because of time or sequence restrictions. Repeat the process for workstation 2, workstation 3, and so on until all tasks are assigned. # PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 6. Evaluate the efficiency of the balance derived using the formula Sum of task times (T) Efficiency = Actual number of workstations (N a ) × Workstations cycle time (C) 7. If efficiency is unsatisfactory, rebalance using a different decision rule. ILLUSTRATION 7: The MS 800 car is to be assembled on a conveyor belt. Fivehundred cars are required per day. Production time per day is 420 minutes, and theassembly steps and times for the wagon are given below.

Note that D should be assigned before B, and E assigned before C due to this tie-breaking rule. 5. Make task assignments to form workstation 1, workstation 2, and so forth until all tasks are assigned. It is important to meet precedence and cycle time requirements as the assignments are made.

Calculate the efficiency. # PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT T 195 Efficiency = = = .77 or 77% N a C 5 ´ 50.4 7. Evaluate the solution. An efficiency of 77 per cent indicates an imbalance or idle time of 23 per cent (1.0 – .77) across the entire line. In addition to balancing a line for a given cycle time, managers must also consider four otheroptions: pacing, behavioural factors, number of models produced, and cycle times. Pacing is the movement of product from one station to the next after the cycle time haselapsed. Paced lines have no buffer inventory. Unpaced lines require inventory storage areas tobe placed between stations.BEHAVIOURAL FACTORSThe most controversial aspect of product layout is behavioural response. Studies have shown thatpaced production and high specialization lower job satisfaction. One study has shown thatproductivity increased on unpaced lines. Many companies are exploring job enlargement androtation to increase job variety and reduce excessive specialization. For example, New York Lifehas redesigned the jobs of workers who process and evaluate claims applications. Instead ofusing a production line approach with several workers doing specialized tasks, New York Lifehas made each worker solely responsible for an entire application. This approach increasedworker responsibility and raised morale. In manufacturing, at its plant in Kohda, Japan, SonyCorporation dismantled the conveyor belts on which as many as 50 people assembled camcorders.It set up tables for workers to assemble an entire camera themselves, doing everything fromsoldering to testing. Output per worker is up 10 per cent, because the approach frees efficientassemblers to make more products instead of limiting them to conveyor belt’s speed. And ifsomething goes wrong, only a small section of the plant is affected. This approach also allows theline to match actual demand better and avoid frequent shutdown because of inventory buildups.NUMBER OF MODELS PRODUCEDA mixed-model line produces several items belonging to the same family. A single-model lineproduces one model with no variations. Mixed model production enables a plant to achieve bothhigh-volume production and product variety. However, it complicates scheduling and increasesthe need for good communication about the specific parts to be produced at each station.CYCLE TIMESA line’s cycle time depends on the desired output rate (or sometimes on the maximum numberof workstations allowed). In turn, the maximum line efficiency varies considerably with the cycletime selected. Thus, exploring a range of cycle times makes sense. A manager might go witha particularly efficient solution even if it does not match the output rate. The manager cancompensate for the mismatch by varying the number of hours the line operates through overtime,extending shifts, or adding shifts. Multiple lines might even be the answer. 2.10 DESIGN OF PROCESS LAYOUTThe analysis involved in the design of production lines and assembly lines relates primarily totiming, coordination, and balance among individual stages in the process. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT #! For process layouts, the relative arrangement of departments and machines is the criticalfactor because of the large amount of transportation and handling involved.PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNING PROCESS LAYOUTSProcess layout design determines the best relative locations of functional work centres. Workcentres that interact frequently, with movement of material or people, should be located closetogether, whereas those that have little interaction can be spatially separated. One approach ofdesigning an efficient functional layout is described below. 1. List and describe each functional work centre. 2. Obtain a drawing and description of the facility being designed. 3. Identify and estimate the amount of material and personnel flow among work centres 4. Use structured analytical methods to obtain a good general layout. 5. Evaluate and modify the layout, incorporating details such as machine orientation, storage area location, and equipment access. The first step in the layout process is to identify and describe each work centre. Thedescription should include the primary function of the work centre; drilling, new accounts, orcashier; its major components, including equipment and number of personnel; and the spacerequired. The description should also include any special access needs (such as access to runningwater or an elevator) or restrictions (it must be in a clean area or away from heat). For a new facility, the spatial configuration of the work centres and the size and shape ofthe facility are determined simultaneously. Determining the locations of special structures andfixtures such as elevators, loading docks, and bathrooms becomes part of the layout process.However, in many cases the facility and its characteristics are a given. In these situations, it isnecessary to obtain a drawing of the facility being designed, including shape and dimensions,locations of fixed structures, and restrictions on activities, such as weight limits on certain partsof a floor or foundation. Fig 2.11 Relationship flow diagram To minimize transport times and material-handling costs, we would like to place closetogether those work centres that have the greatest flow of materials and people between them. #&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTTo estimate the flows between work centres, it is helpful to begin by drawing relationship diagramas shown in Fig. 2.11. For manufacturing systems, material flows and transporting costs can be estimated reasonablywell using historical routings for products or through work sampling techniques applied to workersor jobs. The flow of people, especially in a service system such as a business office or auniversity administration building, may be difficult to estimate precisely, although work samplingcan be used to obtain rough estimates. The amounts and/or costs of flows among work centres are usually presented using a flowmatrix, a flow-cost matrix, or a proximity chart.1. Flow Matrix A flow matrix is a matrix of the estimated amounts of flow between each pair of workcentres. The flow may be materials (expressed as the number of loads transported) or peoplewho move between centres. Each work centre corresponds to one row and one column, and theelement fij designates the amount of flow from work centre (row) I to work centre (column) j.Normally, the direction of flow between work centres is not important, only the total amount, sofij and fji can be combined and the flows represented using only the upper right half of a matrix.

Flow-cost Matrix A basic assumption of facility layout is that the cost of moving materials or people betweenwork centers is a function of distance travelled. Although more complicated cost functions canbe accommodated, often we assume that the per unit cost of material and personnel flows betweenwork centres is proportional to the distance between the centres. So for each type of flowbetween each pair of departments, i and j, we estimate the cost per unit per unit distance, cij.

Proximity Chart Proximity charts (relationship charts) are distinguished from flow and flow-cost matrices bythe fact that they describe qualitatively the desirability or need for work centres to be closetogether, rather than providing quantitative measures of flow and cost. These charts are usedwhen it is difficult to measure or estimate precise amounts or costs of flow among work centres.This is common when the primary flows involve people and do not have a direct cost but ratheran indirect cost, such as when employees in a corporate headquarters move among departments(payroll, printing, information systems) to carry out their work. 2.11 SERVICE LAYOUTThe major factors considered for service providers, is an impact of location on sales and customersatisfaction. Customers usually look about how close a service facility is, particularly if theprocess requires considerable customer contact. Hence, service facility layouts should provide foreasy entrance to these facilities from the freeways. Well-organized packing areas, easily accessiblefacilities, well designed walkways and parking areas are some of the requirements of servicefacility layout. Service facility layout will be designed based on degree of customer contact and the serviceneeded by a customer. These service layouts follow conventional layouts as required. For example,for car service station, product layout is adopted, where the activities for servicing a car followsa sequence of operation irrespective of the type of car. Hospital service is the best example foradaptation of process layout. Here, the service required for a customer will follow an independentpath. The layout of car servicing and hospital is shown in Figs. 2.12 and 2.13. #$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Fig. 2.12 Service layout for car servicing Fig. 2.13 Layout for hospitality service 2.12 ORGANISATION OF PHYSICAL FACILITIES The following are the most important physical facilities to be organised: 1. Factory building 2. Lighting 3. Claimatic conditions 4. Ventilation 5. Work-related welfare facilitiesI. FACTORY BUILDINGFactory building is a factor which is the most important consideration for every industrial enterprise.A modem factory building is required to provide protection for men, machines, materials, products PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT #%or even the company’s secrets. It has to serve as a part of the production facilities and as afactor to maximise economy and efficiency in plant operations. It should offer a pleasant andcomfortable working environment and project the management’s image and prestige. Factorybuilding is like skin and bones of a living body for an organisation. It is for these reasons thatthe factory building acquires great importance. Following factors are considered for an Industrial Building: A. Design of the building. B. Types of buildings.A. Design of the BuildingThe building should designed so as to provide a number of facilities—such as lunch rooms,cafeteria, locker rooms, crèches, libraries, first-aid and ambulance rooms, materials handlingfacilities, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, etc. Following factors are considerations in thedesigning of a factory building: 1. Flexibility: Flexibility is one of the important considerations because the building is likelyto become obsolete and provides greater operating efficiency even when processes and technologychange. Flexibility is necessary because it is not always feasible and economical to build a newplant, every time a new firm is organised or the layout is changed. With minor alternations, thebuilding should be able to accommodate different types of operations. 2. Product and equipment: The type of product that is to be manufactured, determinescolumn-spacing, type of floor, ceiling, heating and air-conditioning. A product of a temporarynature may call for a less expensive building and that would be a product of a more permanentnature. Similarly, a heavy product demands a far more different building than a product whichis light in weight. 3. Expansibility: Growth and expansion are natural to any manufacturing enterprises. Theyare the indicators of the prosperity of a business. The following factors should be borne in mindif the future expansion of the concern is to be provided for: (i) The area of the land which is to be acquired should be large enough to provide for the future expansion needs of the firm and accommodate current needs. (ii) The design of the building should be in a rectangular shape. Rectangular shapes facilitate expansion on any side. (iii) If vertical expansion is expected, strong foundations, supporters and columns must be provided. (iv) If horizontal expansion is expected, the side walls must be made non-load-bearing to provide for easy removal. 4. Employee facilities and service area: Employee facilities must find a proper place inthe building design because they profoundly affect the morale, comfort and productivity. Thebuilding plan should include facilities for lunch rooms, cafeteria, water coolers, parking area andthe like. The provision of some of these facilities is a legal requirement. Others make goodworking conditions possible. And a good working condition is good business. #&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Service areas, such as the tool room, the supervisor’s office, the maintenance room, receivingand dispatching stations, the stock room and facilities for scrap disposal, should also be includedin the building design.B. Types of Buildings Industrial buildings may be grouped under three types: 1. Single-storey buildings, 2. Multi-storey buildings The decision on choosing a suitable type for a particular firm depends on the manufacturingprocess and the area of land and the cost of construction.1. SINGLE-STOREY BUILDINGSMost of the industrial buildings manufacturing which are now designed and constructed are singlestoreyed, particularly where lands are available at reasonable rates. Single-storey buildings offerseveral operating advantages. A single-storey construction is preferable when materials handlingis difficult because the product is big or heavy, natural lighting is desired, heavy floor loads arerequired and frequent changes in layout are anticipated.Advantages Advantages of single-storey building are: 1. There is a greater flexibility in layout and production routing. 2. The maintenance cost resulting from the vibration of machinery is reduced considerably because of the housing of the machinery on the ground. 3. Expansion is easily ensured by the removal of walls. 4. The cost of transportation of materials is reduced because of the absence of materials handling equipment between floors. 5. All the equipment is on the same level, making for an easier and more effective layout supervision and control. 6. Greater floor load-bearing capacity for heavy equipment is ensured. 7. The danger of fire hazards is reduced because of the lateral spread of the building.Limitations Single-storey buildings suffer from some limitations. These are: 1. High cost of land, particularly in the city. 2. High cost of heating, ventilating and cleaning of windows. 3. High cost of transportation for moving men and materials to the factory which is generally located far from the city.2. MULTI-STOREY BUILDINGSSchools, colleges, shopping complexes, and residences, and for service industries like Software,BPO etc. multi-storey structures are generally popular, particularly in cities. Multi-storey buildingsare useful in manufacture of light products, when the acquisition of land becomes difficult andexpensive and when the floor load is less. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT #Advantages When constructed for industrial use, multi-storey buildings offer the following advantages: 1. Maximum operating floor space (per sq. ft. of land). This is best suited in areas where land is very costly. 2. Lower cost of heating and ventilation. 3. Reduced cost of materials handling because the advantage of the use of gravity for the flow of materials.Limitations Following are the disadvantages of multi-storey building: 1. Materials handling becomes very complicated. A lot of time is wasted in moving them between floors. 2. A lot of floor space is wasted on elevators, stairways and fire escapes. 3. Floor load-bearing capacity is limited, unless special construction is used, which is very expensive. 4. Natural lighting is poor in the centres of the shop, particularly when the width of the building is somewhat great. 5. Layout changes cannot be effected easily and quickly. Generally speaking, textile mills, food industries, detergent plants, chemical industries andsoftware industry use these types of buildings.II. LIGHTINGIt is estimated that 80 per cent of the information required in doing job is perceived visually. Goodvisibility of the equipment, the product and the data involved in the work process is an essentialfactor in accelerating production, reducing the number of defective products, cutting down wasteand preventing visual fatigue and headaches among the workers. It may also be added that bothinadequate visibility and glare are frequently causes accidents. In principle, lighting should be adapted to the type of work. However, the level of illumination,measured in should be increased not only in relation to the degree of precision or miniaturizationof the work but also in relation to the worker’s age. The accumulation of dust and the wear ofthe light sources cut down the level of illumination by 10–50 per cent of the original level. Thisgradual drop in the level should therefore be compensated for when designing the lighting system.Regular cleaning of lighting fixture is obviously essential. Excessive contrasts in lighting levels between the worker’s task and the general surroundingsshould also be avoided. The use of natural light should be encouraged. This can be achieved byinstalling windows that open, which are recommended to have an area equal to the time of day,the distance of workstations from the windows and the presence or absence of blinds. For thisreason it is essential to have artificial lighting, will enable people to maintain proper vision andwill ensure that the lighting intensity ratios between the task, the surrounding objects and thegeneral environment are maintained. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTCONTROL OF LIGHTINGIn order to make the best use of lighting in the work place, the following points should be takeninto account: 1. For uniform light distribution, install an independent switch for the row of lighting fixtures closest to the windows. This allows the lights to be switched on and off depending on whether or not natural light is sufficient. 2. To prevent glare, avoid using highly shiny, glossy work surfaces. 3. Use localized lighting in order to achieve the desired level for a particular fine job. 4. Clean light fixtures regularly and follow a maintenance schedule so as to prevent flickering of old bulbs and electrical hazards due to worn out cables. 5. Avoid direct eye contact with the light sources. This is usually achieved by positioning them property. The use of diffusers is also quite effective.III. CLIMATIC CONDITIONSControl of the climatic conditions at the workplace is paramount importance to the workers healthand comfort and to the maintenance of higher productivity. With excess heat or cold, workersmay feel very uncomfortable, and their efficiency drops. In addition, this can lead to accidents. This human body functions in such a way as to keep the central nervous system and theinternal organs at a constant temperature. It maintains the necessary thermal balance by continuousheat exchange with the environment. It is essential to avoid excessive hear or cold, and whereverpossible to keep the climatic conditions optimal so that the body can maintain a thermal balance.WORKING IN A HOT ENVIRONMENTHot working environments are found almost everywhere. Work premise in tropical countries may,on account of general climatic conditions, be naturally hot. When source of heat such as furnaces,kilns or hot processes are present, or when the physical workload is heavy, the human body mayalso have to deal with excess heat. It should be noted that in such hot working environmentssweating is almost the only way in which the body can lose heat. As the sweat evaporates, thebody cools. There is a relationship between the amount and speed of evaporation and a feelingof comfort. The more intense the evaporation, the quicker the body will cool and feel refreshed.Evaporation increases with adequate ventilation.WORKING IN A COLD ENVIRONMENTWorking in cold environments was once restricted to non-tropical or highly elevated regions. Nowas a result of modern refrigeration, various groups of workers, even in tropical countries, areexposed to a cold environment. Exposure to cold for short periods of time can produce serious effects, especially whenworkers are exposed to temperatures below 10°C The loss of body heat is uncomfortable andquickly affects work efficiency. Workers in cold climates and refrigerated premises should bewell protected against the cold by wearing suitable clothes, including footwear, gloves and, mostimportantly, a hat. Normally, dressing in layers traps dead air and serves as an insulation layer,thus keeping the worker warmer. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT $CONTROL OF THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENTThere are many ways of controlling the thermal environment. It is relatively easy to assess theeffects of thermal conditions, especially when excessive heat or cold is an obvious problem. Tosolve the problem, however, consistent efforts using a variety of available measures are usuallynecessary. This is because the problem is linked with the general climate, which greatly affectsthe workplace climate, production technology, which is often the source of heat or cold andvarying conditions of the work premises as well as work methods and schedules. Personal factorssuch as clothing, nutrition, personal habits, and age and individual differences in response to thegiven thermal conditions also need to be taken into account in the attempt to attain the thermalcomfort of workers. In controlling the thermal environment, one or more of the following principles may be applied: 1. Regulating workroom temperature by preventing outside heat or cold from entering (improved design of the roof, insulation material or installing an air-conditioned workroom. Air-conditioning is costly, especially in factories. But it is sometimes a worthwhile investment if an appropriate type is chosen); 2. provision of ventilation in hot workplaces by increasing natural ventilating through openings or installing ventilation devices; 3. separation of heat sources from the working area, insulation of hot surfaces and pipes, or placement of barriers between the heat sources and the workers; 4. control of humidity with a view to keeping it at low levels, for example by preventing the escape of steam from pipes and equipment; 5. Provision of adequate personal protective clothing and equipment for workers exposed to excessive radiant heat or excessive cold (heat-protective clothing with high insulation value may not be recommended for jobs with long exposure to moderate or heavy work as it prevents evaporative heat loss); 6. Reduction of exposure time, for example, by mechanization, remote control or alternating work schedules; 7. Insertion of rest pauses between work periods, with comfortable, if possible air-conditioned, resting facilities; 8. Ensuring a supply of cold drinking-water for workers in a hot environment and of hot drinks for those exposed to a cold environment.IV. VENTILATIONVentilation is the dynamic parameter that complements the concept of air space. For a givennumber of workers, the smaller the work premises the more should be the ventilation. Ventilation differs from air circulation. Ventilation replaces contaminated air by fresh air,whereas as the air-circulation merely moves the air without renewing it. Where the air temperatureand humidity are high, merely to circulate the air is not only ineffective but also increases heatabsorption. Ventilation disperses the heat generated by machines and people at work. Adequateventilation should be looked upon as an important factor in maintaining the worker’s health andproductivity. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Except for confined spaces, all working premises have some minimum ventilation. However,to ensure the necessary air flow (which should not be lower than 50 cubic metres of air per hourper worker), air usually needs to be changed between four to eight times per hour in offices orfor sedentary workers, between eight and 12 times per hour in workshops and as much as 15to 30 or more times per hour for public premises and where there are high levels of atmosphericpollution or humidity. The air speed used for workplace ventilation should be adapted to the airtemperature and the energy expenditure: for sedentary work it should exceed 0.2 metre persecond, but for a hot environment the optimum speed is between 0.5 and 1 metre per second.For hazardous work it may be even higher. Certain types of hot work can be made tolerable bydirecting a stream of cold air at the workers. Natural ventilation, obtained by opening windows or wall or roof airvents, may producesignificant air flows but can normally be used only in relatively mild climates. The effectivenessof this type of ventilation depends largely on external conditions. Where natural ventilation isinadequate, artificial ventilation should be used. A choice may be made between a blown-airsystem, an exhaust air system or a combination of both (‘push-pull’ ventilation). Only ‘push-pull’ventilation systems allow for better regulation of air movement.V. WORK-RELATED WELFARE FACILITIESWork-related welfare facilities offered at or through the workplace can be important factors.Some facilities are very basic, but often ignored, such as drinking-water and toilets. Others mayseem less necessary, but usually have an importance to workers far greater than their cost tothe enterprise.1. DRINKING WATERSafe, cool drinking water is essential for all types of work, especially in a hot environment.Without it fatigue increases rapidly and productivity falls. Adequate drinking water should beprovided and maintained at convenient points, and clearly marked as “Safe drinking water”.Where possible it should be kept in suitable vessels, renewed at least daily, and all practical stepstaken to preserve the water and the vessels from contamination.2. SANITARY FACILITIESHygienic sanitary facilities should exist in all workplaces. They are particularly important wherechemicals or other dangerous substances are used. Sufficient toilet facilities, with separatefacilities for men and women workers, should be installed and conveniently located. Changing-rooms and cloakrooms should be provided. Washing facilities, such as washbasins with soap andtowels, or showers, should be placed either within changing-rooms or close by.3. FIRST-AID AND MEDICAL FACILITIESFacilities for rendering first-aid and medical care at the workplace in case of accidents orunforeseen sickness are directly related to the health and safety of the workers. First-aid boxesshould be clearly marked and conveniently located. They should contain only first-aid requisitesof a prescribed standard and should be in the charge of qualified person. Apart from first-aidboxes, it is also desirable to have a stretcher and suitable means to transport injured persons toa centre where medical care can be provided. PLANT LOCATION AND LAYOUT $!4. REST FACILITIESRest facilities can include seat, rest-rooms, waiting rooms and shelters. They help workers torecover from fatigue and to get away from a noisy, polluted or isolated workstation. A sufficientnumber of suitable chairs or benches with backrests should be provided and maintained, includingseats for occasional rest of workers who are obliged to work standing up. Rest-rooms enableworkers to recover during meal and rest breaks.5. FEEDING FACILITIESIt is now well recognized that the health and work capacity of workers to have light refreshmentsare needed. A full meal at the workplace in necessary when the workers live some distance awayand when the hours of work are so organized that the meal breaks are short. A snack bar, buffetor mobile trolleys can provide tea, coffee and soft drinks, as well as light refreshments. Canteensor a restaurant can allow workers to purchase a cheap, well-cooked and nutritious meal for areasonable price and eat in a clean, comfortable place, away from the workstation.6. CHILD-CARE FACILITIESMany employers find that working mothers are especially loyal and effective workers, but theyoften face the special problems of carrying for children. It is for this reason that child-carefacilities, including crèches and day-care centres, should be provided. These should be in secure,airy, clean and well lit premises. Children should be looked after property by qualified staff andoffered food, drink education and play at very low cost.7. RECREATIONAL FACILITIESRecreational facilities offer workers the opportunity to spend their leisure time in activities likelyto increase physical and mental well-being. They may also help to improve social relations withinthe enterprise. Such facilities can include halls for recreation and for indoor and outdoor sports,reading-rooms and libraries, clubs for hobbies, picnics and cinemas. Special educational andvocational training courses can also be organized. EXERCISESSection A 1. What do you mean by plant location? 2. What is virtual proximity? 3. What is virtual factory? 4.

Material handling does not addany value to the product but adds to the cost of the product and hence it will cost the customermore. So the handling should be kept at minimum. Material handling in Indian industries accountsfor nearly 40% of the cost of production. Out of the total time spent for manufacturing a product,20% of the time is utilised for actual processing on them while the remaining 80% of the timeis spent in moving from one place to another, waiting for the processing. Poor material handlingmay result in delays leading to idling of equipment. Materials handling can be also defined as ‘the function dealing with the preparation,placing and positioning of materials to facilitate their movement or storage’. Materialhandling is the art and science involving the movement, handling and storage of materials duringdifferent stages of manufacturing. Thus the function includes every consideration of the productexcept the actual processing operation. In many cases, the handling is also included as an integralpart of the process. Through scientific material handling considerable reduction in the cost as wellas in the production cycle time can be achieved. 65 $$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 3.2 OBJECTIVES OF MATERIAL HANDLINGFollowing are the objectives of material handling: 1. Minimise cost of material handling. 2. Minimise delays and interruptions by making available the materials at the point of use at right quantity and at right time. 3. Increase the productive capacity of the production facilities by effective utilisation of capacity and enhancing productivity. 4. Safety in material handling through improvement in working condition. 5. Maximum utilisation of material handling equipment. 6. Prevention of damages to materials. 7. Lower investment in process inventory. 3.3 PRINCIPLES OF MATERIAL HANDLINGFollowing are the principles of material handling: 1. Planning principle: All handling activities should be planned. 2. Systems principle: Plan a system integrating as many handling activities as possible and co-ordinating the full scope of operations (receiving, storage, production, inspection, packing, warehousing, supply and transportation). 3. Space utilisation principle: Make optimum use of cubic space. 4. Unit load principle: Increase quantity, size, weight of load handled. 5. Gravity principle: Utilise gravity to move a material wherever practicable. 6. Material flow principle: Plan an operation sequence and equipment arrangement to optimise material flow. 7. Simplification principle: Reduce combine or eliminate unnecessary movement and/or equipment. 8. Safety principle: Provide for safe handling methods and equipment. 9. Mechanisation principle: Use mechanical or automated material handling equipment. 10. Standardisation principle: Standardise method, types, size of material handling equipment. 11. Flexibility principle: Use methods and equipment that can perform a variety of task and applications. 12. Equipment selection principle: Consider all aspect of material, move and method to be utilised. 13. Dead weight principle: Reduce the ratio of dead weight to pay load in mobile equipment. 14. Motion principle: Equipment designed to transport material should be kept in motion. 15. Idle time principle: Reduce idle time/unproductive time of both MH equipment and man power. 16. Maintenance principle: Plan for preventive maintenance or scheduled repair of all handling equipment. MATERIAL HANDLING $% 17. Obsolescence principle: Replace obsolete handling methods/equipment when more efficient method/equipment will improve operation. 18. Capacity principle: Use handling equipment to help achieve its full capacity. 19. Control principle: Use material handling equipment to improve production control, inventory control and other handling. 20. Performance principle: Determine efficiency of handling performance in terms of cost per unit handled which is the primary criterion. 3.4 SELECTION OF MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENTSSelection of Material Handling equipment is an important decision as it affects both cost andefficiency of handling system. The following factors are to be taken into account while selectingmaterial handling equipment.1. PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIALWhether it is solid, liquid or gas, and in what size, shape and weight it is to be moved, areimportant considerations and can already lead to a preliminary elimination from the range ofavailable equipment under review. Similarly, if a material is fragile, corrosive or toxic this willimply that certain handling methods and containers will be preferable to others.2. LAYOUT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUILDINGAnother restricting factor is the availability of space for handling. Low-level ceiling maypreclude the use of hoists or cranes, and the presence of supporting columns in awkwardplaces can limit the size of the material-handling equipment. If the building is multi-storeyed,chutes or ramps for industrial trucks may be used. Layout itself will indicate the type ofproduction operation (continuous, intermittent, fixed position or group) and can indicate someitems of equipment that will be more suitable than others. Floor capacity also helps in selectingthe best material handling equipment.3. PRODUCTION FLOWIf the flow is fairly constant between two fixed positions that are not likely to change, fixedequipment such as conveyors or chutes can be successfully used. If, on the other hand, theflow is not constant and the direction changes occasionally from one point to another becauseseveral products are being produced simultaneously, moving equipment such as trucks wouldbe preferable.4. COST CONSIDERATIONSThis is one of the most important considerations. The above factors can help to narrow the rangeof suitable equipment, while costing can help in taking a final decision. Several cost elementsneed to be taken into consideration when comparisons are made between various items ofequipment that are all capable of handling the same load. Initial investment and operating andmaintenance costs are the major cost to be considered. By calculating and comparing the totalcost for each of the items of equipment under consideration, a more rational decision can bereached on the most appropriate choice. $&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT5. NATURE OF OPERATIONSSelection of equipment also depends on nature of operations like whether handling is temporaryor permanent, whether the flow is continuous or intermittent and material flow pattern-verticalor horizontal.6. ENGINEERING FACTORSSelection of equipment also depends on engineering factors like door and ceiling dimensions, floorspace, floor conditions and structural strength.7. EQUIPMENT RELIABILITYReliability of the equipment and supplier reputation and the after sale service also plays animportant role in selecting material handling equipments. 3.5 EVALUATION OF MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEMThe cost factors include investment cost, labour cost, and anticipated service hours per year,utilization, and unit load carrying ability, loading and unloading characteristics, operating costs andthe size requirements are the factors for evolution of material handling equipment. Other factorsto be considered are source of power, conditions where the equipment has to operate and suchother technical aspects. Therefore, choices of equipments in organisation will improve the materialhandling system through work study techniques. They usually result in improving the ratio ofoperating time to loading time through palletizing, avoiding duplicative movements, etc. Obsoletehandling systems can be replaced with more efficient equipments. The effectiveness of the material handling system can be measured in terms of the ratio ofthe time spent in the handling to the total time spent in production. This will cover the timeelement. The cost effectiveness can be measured by the expenses incurred per unit weighthandled. It can be safely said that very few organisations try to collate the expenses and timein this manner so as to objectively view the performance and to take remedial measures. Someof the other indices which can be used for evaluating the performance of handling systems arelisted below:EQUIPMENT UTILISATION RATIOEquipment utilisation ratio is an important indicator for judging the materials handling system. Thisratio can be computed and compared with similar firms or in the same over a period of time. In order to know the total effort needed for moving materials, it may be necessary tocompute Materials Handling Labour (MHL) ratio. This ratio is calculated as under: Personnel assigned to materials handling MHL = Total operating work force In order to ascertain whether is the handling system delivers materials work centres withmaximum efficiency, it is desirable to compute direct labour handling loss ratio. The ratio is: Materials handling time lost of labour DLHL = Total direct labour time MATERIAL HANDLING $ The movement’s operations ratio which is calculated after dividing total number of movesby total number of productive operations indicates whether the workers are going through toomany motions because of poor routing. It should, however, be emphasized that the efficiency of materials handling mainly dependson the following factors: (i) efficiency of handling methods employed for handling a unit weightthrough a unit distance, (ii) efficiency of the layout which determines the distance through whichthe materials have to be handled, (iii) utilisation of the handling facilities, and (iv) efficiency ofthe speed of handling. In conclusion, it can be said that an effective material handling system depends upon tailoringthe layout and equipments to suit specific requirements. When a large volume has to be movedfrom a limited number of sources to a limited number of destinations the fixed path equipmentslike rollers, belt conveyors, overhead conveyors and gauntry cranes are preferred. For increasedflexibility varied path equipments are preferred. 3.6 MATERIAL HANDING EQUIPMENTSBroadly material handling equipment’s can be classified into two categories, namely:(a) Fixed path equipments, and (b) Variable path equipments. (a) Fixed path equipments which move in a fixed path. Conveyors, monorail devices, chutes and pulley drive equipments belong to this category. A slight variation in this category is provided by the overhead crane, which though restricted, can move materials in any manner within a restricted area by virtue of its design. Overhead cranes have a very good range in terms of hauling tonnage and are used for handling bulky raw materials, stacking and at times palletizing. (b) Variable path equipments have no restrictions in the direction of movement although their size is a factor to be given due consideration trucks, forklifts mobile cranes and industrial tractors belong to this category. Forklifts are available in many ranges, they are manoeuvrable and various attachments are provided to increase their versatility. Material Handing Equipments may be classified in five major categories.1. CONVEYORSConveyors are useful for moving material between two fixed workstations, either continuouslyor intermittently. They are mainly used for continuous or mass production operations—indeed,they are suitable for most operations where the flow is more or less steady. Conveyors may beof various types, with rollers, wheels or belts to help move the material along: these may bepower-driven or may roll freely. The decision to provide conveyors must be taken with care,since they are usually costly to install; moreover, they are less flexible and, where two or moreconverge, it is necessary to coordinate the speeds at which the two conveyors move.2. INDUSTRIAL TRUCKSIndustrial trucks are more flexible in use than conveyors since they can move between variouspoints and are not permanently fixed in one place. They are, therefore, most suitable for intermittent % PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTproduction and for handling various sizes and shapes of material. There are many types of truck-petrol-driven, electric, hand-powered, and so on. Their greatest advantage lies in the wide rangeof attachments available; these increase the trucks ability to handle various types and shapes ofmaterial.3. CRANES AND HOISTSThe major advantage of cranes and hoists is that they can move heavy materials throughoverhead space. However, they can usually serve only a limited area. Here again, there areseveral types of crane and hoist, and within each type there are various loading capacities.Cranes and hoists may be used both for intermittent and for continuous production.4. CONTAINERSThese are either ‘dead’ containers (e.g. Cartons, barrels, skids, pallets) which hold the materialto be transported but do not move themselves, or ‘live’ containers (e.g. wagons, wheelbarrowsor computer self-driven containers). Handling equipments of this kind can both contain and movethe material, and is usually operated manually.5. ROBOTSMany types of robot exist. They vary in size, and in function and manoeuvrability. While manyrobots are used for handling and transporting material, others are used to perform operations suchas welding or spray painting. An advantage of robots is that they can perform in a hostileenvironment such as unhealthy conditions or carry on arduous tasks such as the repetitivemovement of heavy materials. The choice of material-handling equipment among the various possibilities that exist is noteasy. In several cases the same material may be handled by various types of equipments, andthe great diversity of equipment and attachments available does not make the problem any easier.In several cases, however, the nature of the material to be handled narrows the choice. Someof the material handling equipment are shown in Figs. 3.1 to 3.11.

As material handling adds no value but increases the production cycle time, eliminate handling wherever possible. Ideally there should not be any handling at all! 2. Sequence the operations in logical manner so that handling is unidirectional and smooth. 3. Use gravity wherever possible as it results in conservation of power and fuel. 4. Standardise the handling equipments to the extent possible as it means interchangeable usage, better utilisation of handling equipments, and lesser spares holding. 5. Install a regular preventive maintenance programme for material handling equipments so that downtime is minimum. 6. In selection of handling equipments, criteria of versatility and adaptability must be the governing factor. This will ensure that investments in special purpose handling equipments are kept at a minimum. 7. Weight of unit load must be maximum so that each ‘handling trip’ is productive. 8. Work study aspects, such a elimination of unnecessary movements and combination of processes should be considered while installing a material handling system. 9. Non-productive operations in handling, such as slinging, loading, etc., should be kept at a minimum through appropriate design of handling equipment. Magnetic cranes for scrap movement and loading in furnaces combination of excavators and tippers for ores loading and unloading in mines are examples in this respect. 10. Location of stores should be as close as possible to the plant which uses the materials. This avoids handling and minimizing investment in material handling system. 11. Application of OR techniques such as queueing can be very effective in optimal utilisation of materials handling equipments. 12. A very important aspect in the design of a material handling system is the safety aspect. The system designed should be simple and safe to operate. 13. Avoid any wasteful movements-method study can be conducted for this purpose. 14. Ensure proper coordination through judicious selection of equipments and training of workmen. 3.8 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLANT LAYOUT AND MATERIAL HANDLINGThere is a close relationship between plant layout and material handling. A good layout ensuresminimum material handling and eliminates rehandling in the following ways: 1. Material movement does not add any value to the product so, the material handling should be kept at minimum though not avoid it. This is possible only through the systematic plant layout. Thus a good layout minimises handling. 2. The productive time of workers will go without production if they are required to travel long distance to get the material tools, etc. Thus a good layout ensures minimum travel %&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT for workman thus enhancing the production time and eliminating the hunting time and travelling time. 3. Space is an important criterion. Plant layout integrates all the movements of men, material through a well designed layout with material handling system. 4. Good plant layout helps in building efficient material handling system. It helps to keep material handling shorter, faster and economical. A good layout reduces the material backtracking, unnecessary workmen movement ensuring effectiveness in manufacturing. Thus a good layout always ensures minimum material handling.

Its main objective is cost reduction and efficient handlingof materials at all stages and in all sections of the undertaking. Its function includes severalimportant aspects connected with material, such as, purchasing, storage, inventory control, materialhandling, standardisation etc. 4.2 SCOPE OR FUNCTIONS OF MATERIALS MANAGEMENTMaterials management is defined as “the function responsible for the coordination of planning,sourcing, purchasing, moving, storing and controlling materials in an optimum manner soas to provide a pre-decided service to the customer at a minimum cost”. From the definition it is clear that the scope of materials management is vast. The functionsof materials management can be categorized in the following ways: (as shown in Fig. 4.1.) 1. Material Planning and Control 75 %$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 2. Purchasing 3. Stores Management 4. Inventory Control or Management 5. Standardisation 6. Simplification 7. Value Analysis 8. Erogonomics 9. Just-in-Time (JIT) All the above mentioned functions of materials management has been discussed in detail inthis chapter. Fig. 4.1 Scope of materials management 1. Materials planning and control: Based on the sales forecast and production plans, thematerials planning and control is done. This involves estimating the individual requirements ofparts, preparing materials budget, forecasting the levels of inventories, scheduling the orders andmonitoring the performance in relation to production and sales. 2. Purchasing: This includes selection of sources of supply finalization in terms of purchase,placement of purchase orders, follow-up, maintenance of smooth relations with suppliers, approvalof payments to suppliers, evaluating and rating suppliers. 3. Stores management or management: This involves physical control of materials,preservation of stores, minimization of obsolescence and damage through timely disposal andefficient handling, maintenance of stores records, proper location and stocking. A store is alsoresponsible for the physical verification of stocks and reconciling them with book figures. A storeplays a vital role in the operations of a company. 4. Inventory control or management: Inventory generally refers to the materials in stock.It is also called the idle resource of an enterprise. Inventories represent those items, which areeither stocked for sale or they are in the process of manufacturing or they are in the form of MATERIALS MANAGEMENT %%materials, which are yet to be utilized. The interval between receiving the purchased parts andtransforming them into final products varies from industries to industries depending upon the cycletime of manufacture. It is, therefore, necessary to hold inventories of various kinds to act as abuffer between supply and demand for efficient operation of the system. Thus, an effectivecontrol on inventory is a must for smooth and efficient running of the production cycle with leastinterruptions. 5. Other related activities (a) 3S (i) Standardization: Standardization means producing maximum variety of products fromthe minimum variety of materials, parts, tools and processes. It is the process of establishingstandards or units of measure by which extent, quality, quantity, value, performance etc. may becompared and measured. (ii) Simplification: The concept of simplification is closely related to standardization.Simplification is the process of reducing the variety of products manufactured. Simplification isconcerned with the reduction of product range, assemblies, parts, materials and design. (iii) Specifications: It refers to a precise statement that formulizes the requirements of thecustomer. It may relate to a product, process or a service. Example: Specifications of an axle block are Inside Dia. = 2 ± 0.1 cm, Outside Dia. = 4± 0.2 cm and Length = 10 ± 0.5 cm. (b) Value analysis: Value analysis is concerned with the costs added due to inefficient orunnecessary specifications and features. It makes its contribution in the last stage of product cycle,namely, the maturity stage. At this stage research and development no longer make positive contributionsin terms of improving the efficiency of the functions of the product or adding new functions to it. (c) Ergonomics (Human Engineering): The human factors or human engineering isconcerned with man-machine system. Ergonomics is “the design of human tasks, man-machinesystem, and effective accomplishment of the job, including displays for presenting information tohuman sensors, controls for human operations and complex man-machine systems.” Each of theabove functions are dealt in detail. 4.3 MATERIAL PLANNING AND CONTROLMaterial planning is a scientific technique of determining in advance the requirements of rawmaterials, ancillary parts and components, spares etc. as directed by the production programme.It is a sub-system in the overall planning activity. There are many factors, which influence theactivity of material planning. These factors can be classified as macro and micro systems. 1. Macro factors: Some of the micro factors which affect material planning, are price trends, business cycles Govt. import policy etc. 2. Micro factors: Some of the micro factors that affect material planning are plant capacity utilization, rejection rates, lead times, inventory levels, working capital, delegation of powers and communication. %&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT4.3.1 Techniques of Material PlanningOne of the techniques of material planning is bill of material explosion. Material planning throughbill of material explosion is shown below in Fig. 4.2. Fig. 4.2 Material planning The basis for material planning is the forecast demand for the end products. Forecasting techniquessuch as weighted average method, exponential smoothening and time series models are used for thesame. Once the demand forecast is made, it is possible go through the excerse of material planning.Bill of materials is a document which shows list of materials required, unit consumption location codefor a given product. An explosive chart is a series of bill of material grouped in a matrix form so thatcombined requirements for different components can be done requirements of various materials arearrives at from the demand forecast, using bill of materials, through explosion charts. Thus materialrequirement plan will lead to be the development of delivery schedule of the materials and purchasingof those material requirements. 4.4 PURCHASINGPurchasing is an important function of materials management. In any industry purchase meansbuying of equipments, materials, tools, parts etc. required for industry. The importance of thepurchase function varies with nature and size of industry. In small industry, this function isperformed by works manager and in large manufacturing concern; this function is done by aseparate department. The moment a buyer places an order he commits a substantial portion ofthe finance of the corporation which affects the working capital and cash flow position. He isa highly responsible person who meets various salesmen and thus can be considered to have beencontributing to the public relations efforts of the company. Thus, the buyer can make or mar thecompany’s image by his excellent or poor relations with the vendors. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT %4.4.1 Objectives of PurchasingThe basic objective of the purchasing function is to ensure continuity of supply of raw materials,sub-contracted items and spare parts and to reduce the ultimate cost of the finished goods. Inother words, the objective is not only to procure the raw materials at the lowest price but toreduce the cost of the final product. The objectives of the purchasing department can be outlined as under: 1. To avail the materials, suppliers and equipments at the minimum possible costs: These are the inputs in the manufacturing operations. The minimization of the input cost increases the productivity and resultantly the profitability of the operations. 2. To ensure the continuous flow of production through continuous supply of raw materials, components, tools etc. with repair and maintenance service. 3. To increase the asset turnover: The investment in the inventories should be kept minimum in relation to the volume of sales. This will increase the turnover of the assets and thus the profitability of the company. 4. To develop an alternative source of supply: Exploration of alternative sources of supply of materials increases the bargaining ability of the buyer, minimisation of cost of materials and increases the ability to meet the emergencies. 5. To establish and maintain the good relations with the suppliers: Maintenance of good relations with the supplier helps in evolving a favourable image in the business circles. Such relations are beneficial to the buyer in terms of changing the reasonable price, preferential allocation of material in case of material shortages, etc. 6. To achieve maximum integration with other department of the company: The purchase function is related with production department for specifications and flow of material, engineering department for the purchase of tools, equipments and machines, marketing department for the forecasts of sales and its impact on procurement of materials, financial department for the purpose of maintaining levels of materials and estimating the working capital required, personnel department for the purpose of manning and developing the personnel of purchase department and maintaining good vendor relationship. 7. To train and develop the personnel: Purchasing department is manned with varied types of personnel. The company should try to build the imaginative employee force through training and development. 8. Efficient record keeping and management reporting: Paper processing is inherent in the purchase function. Such paper processing should be standardised so that record keeping can be facilitated. Periodic reporting to the management about the purchase activities justifies the independent existence of the department.4.4.2 Parameters of PurchasingThe success of any manufacturing activity is largely dependent on the procurement of rawmaterials of right quality, in the right quantities, from right source, at the right time and at right &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTprice popularly known as ten ‘R’s’ of the art of efficient purchasing. They are described as thebasic principles of purchasing. There are other well known parameters such as right contractualterms, right material, right place, right mode of transportation and right attitude are also consideredfor purchasing.1. RIGHT PRICEIt is the primary concern of any manufacturing organization to get an item at the right price. Butright price need not be the lowest price. It is very difficult to determine the right price; generalguidance can be had from the cost structure of the product. The ‘tender system’ of buying isnormally used in public sector organizations but the objective should be to identify the lowest‘responsible’ bidder and not the lowest bidder. The technique of ‘learning curve’ also helps thepurchase agent to determine the price of items with high labour content. The price can be kept lowby proper planning and not by rush buying. Price negotiation also helps to determine the right prices.2. RIGHT QUALITYRight quality implies that quality should be available, measurable and understandable as far aspracticable. In order to determine the quality of a product sampling schemes will be useful. Theright quality is determined by the cost of materials and the technical characteristics as suited tothe specific requirements. The quality particulars are normally obtained from the indents. Sincethe objective of purchasing is to ensure continuity of supply to the user departments, the time atwhich the material is provided to the user department assumes great importance.3. RIGHT TIMEFor determining the right time, the purchase manager should have lead time information for allproducts and analyse its components for reducing the same. Lead time is the total time elapsedbetween the recognition of the need of an item till the item arrives and is provided for use. Thiscovers the entire duration of the materials cycle and consists of pre-contractual administrativelead time, manufacturing and transporting lead time and inspection lead time. Since the inventoryincreases with higher lead time, it is desirable to analyse each component of the lead time so asto reduce the first and third components which are controllable. While determining the purchases,the buyer has to consider emergency situations like floods, strikes, etc. He should have ‘contingencyplans’ when force major clauses become operative, for instance, the material is not available dueto strike, lock-out, floods, and earthquakes.4. RIGHT SOURCEThe source from which the material is procured should be dependable and capable of supplyingitems of uniform quality. The buyer has to decide which item should be directly obtained fromthe manufacturer. Source selection, source development and vendor rating play an important rolein buyer-seller relationships. In emergencies, open market purchases and bazaar purchases arerestored to.5. RIGHT QUANTITYThe right quantity is the most important parameter in buying. Concepts, such as, economic orderquantity, economic purchase quantity, fixed period and fixed quantity systems, will serve as broadguidelines. But the buyer has to use his knowledge, experience and common sense to determine MATERIALS MANAGEMENT&amp;the quantity after considering factors such as price structure, discounts, availability of the item,favourable reciprocal relations, and make or buy consideration. Fig. 4.3 Purchase parameters6. RIGHT ATTITUDEDeveloping the right attitude, too, is necessary as one often comes across such statement:‘Purchasing knows the price of everything and value of nothing’; ‘We buy price and not cost’;‘When will our order placers become purchase managers?’; ‘Purchasing acts like a post box’.Therefore, purchasing should keep ‘progress’ as its key activity and should be future-oriented.The purchase manager should be innovative and his long-term objective should be to minimisethe cost of the ultimate product. He will be able to achieve this if he aims himself with techniques,such as, value analysis, materials intelligence, purchases research, SWOT analysis, purchasebudget lead time analysis, etc.7. RIGHT CONTRACTSThe buyer has to adopt separate policies and procedures for capital and consumer items. Heshould be able to distinguish between indigenous and international purchasing procedures. Heshould be aware of the legal and contractual aspects in international practices. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT8. RIGHT MATERIALRight type of material required for the production is an important parameter in purchasing.Techniques, such as, value analysis will enable the buyer to locate the right material.9. RIGHT TRANSPORTATIONRight mode of transportation have to be identified as this forms a critical segment in the costprofile of an item. It is an established fact that the cost of the shipping of ore, gravel, sand, etc.,is normally more than the cost of the item itself.10. RIGHT PLACE OF DELIVERYSpecifying the right place of delivery, like head office or works, would often minimize the handlingand transportation cost.4.4.3 Purchasing ProcedureThe procedure describes the sequence of steps leading to the completion of an identified specifictask. The purchasing procedure comprises the following steps as indicated in Fig. 4.4.1. RECOGNITION OF THE NEEDThe initiation of procedure starts with the recognition of the need by the needy section. Thedemand is lodged with the purchase department in the prescribed Purchase Requisition Formforwarded by the authorised person either directly or through the Stores Department. Thepurchase requisition clearly specifies the details, such as, specification of materials, quality andquantity, suggested supplier, etc. Generally, the low value sundries and items of common use arepurchased for stock while costlier and special items are purchased according the productionprogrammes. Generally, the corporate level executives are authorized signatories to such demands.Such purchases are approved by the Board of Directors. The reference of the approval is madeon requisition and a copy of the requisition is sent to the secretary for the purpose of overallplanning and budgeting.2. THE SELECTION OF THE SUPPLIERThe process of selection of supplier involves two basic aspects: searching for all possible sourcesand short listing out of the identified sources. The complete information about the supplier isavailable from various sources, such as, trade directories, advertisement in trade journals, directmailing by the suppliers, interview with suppliers, salesmen, suggestions from business associates,visit to trade fair, participation in industries convention, etc. Identification of more and more sourceshelps in selecting better and economical supplier. It should be noted that the low bidder is not alwaysthe best bidder. When everything except price is equal, the low bidder will be selected. Theimportant considerations in the selection are the price, ability to supply the required quantity,maintenance of quality standards, financial standing etc. It should be noted that it is not necessaryto go for this process for all types of purchases. For the repetitive orders and for the purchasesof low-value, small lot items, generally the previous suppliers with good records are preferred.3. PLACING THE ORDEROnce the supplier is selected the next step is to place the purchase order. Purchase order is aletter sent to the supplier asking to supply the said material. At least six copies of purchase order MATERIALS MANAGEMENT&amp;!are prepared by the purchase section and each copy is separately signed by the purchase officer.Out these copies, one copy each is sent to store-keeper, supplier, accounts section, inspectiondepartment and to the department placing the requisition and one copy is retained by the purchasedepartment for record. Fig. 4.4 Purchasing procedure4. FOLLOW-UP OF THE ORDERFollow-up procedure should be employed wherever the costs and risks resulting from the delayeddeliveries of materials are greater than the cost of follow-up procedure, the follow-up proceduretries to see that the purchase order is confirmed by the supplier and the delivery is promised. Itis also necessary to review the outstanding orders at regular intervals and to communicate withthe supplier in case of need. Generally, a routine urge is made to the supplier by sending a printedpost card or a circular letter asking him to confirm that the delivery is on the way or will be madeas per agreement. In absence of any reply or unsatisfactory reply, the supplier may be contactthrough personal letter, phone, telegram and/or even personal visit.5. RECEIVING AND INSPECTION OF THE MATERIALSThe receiving department receives the materials supplied by the vendor. The quantity are verifiedand tallied with the purchase order. The receipt of the materials is recorded on the speciallydesigned receiving slips or forms which also specify the name of the vendor and the purchaseorder number. It also records any discrepancy, damaged condition of the consignment or inferiorityof the materials. The purchase department is informed immediately about the receipt of thematerials. Usually a copy of the receiving slip is sent to the purchase department. &amp;&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT6. PAYMENT OF THE INVOICEWhen the goods are received in satisfactory condition, the invoice is checked before it isapproved for the payment. The invoice is checked to see that the goods were duly authorisedto purchase, they were properly ordered, they are priced as per the agreed terms, the quantityand quality confirm to the order, the calculations are arithmetically correct etc.7. MAINTENANCE OF THE RECORDSMaintenance of the records is an important part and parcel of the efficient purchase function.In the industrial firms, most of the purchases are repeat orders and hence the past records serveas a good guide for the future action. They are very useful for deciding the timings of thepurchases and in selecting the best source of the supply.8. MAINTENANCE OF VENDOR RELATIONSThe quantum and frequency of the transactions with the same key suppliers provide a platformfor the purchase department to establish and maintain good relations with them. Good relationsdevelop mutual trust and confidence in the course of the time which is beneficial to both theparties. The efficiency of the purchase department can be measured by the amount of thegoodwill it has with its suppliers.4.4.4 Selection of SuppliersSelection of the right supplier is the responsibility of the purchase department. It can contributesubstantially to the fundamental objectives of the business enterprise. Different strategies arerequired for acquiring different types of materials. The selection of supplier for standardisedproducts will differ from non-standardised products. Following factors are considered for theselection of suppliers:A. SOURCES OF SUPPLIERThe best buying is possible only when the decision maker is familiar with all possible sources ofsupply and their respective terms and conditions. The purchase department should try to locatethe appropriate sources of the supplier of various types of materials. This is known as ‘surveystage’. A survey of the following will help in developing the possible sources of supply: 1. Specialised trade directories. 2. Assistance of professional bodies or consultants. 3. The buyer’s guide or purchase handbook. 4. The manufacturer’s or distributor’s catalogue. 5. Advertisements in dailies. 6. Advertisement in specialised trade journals. 7. Trade fair exhibitions.B. DEVELOPMENT OF APPROVED LIST OF SUPPLIERSThe survey stage highlights the existence of the source. A business inquiry is made with theappropriate supplier. It is known as ‘Inquiry Stage’. Here a short listing is made out of the givensources of suppliers in terms of production facilities and capacity, financial standing, product MATERIALS MANAGEMENT&amp;#quality, possibility of timely supply, technical competence, manufacturing efficiency, general businesspolicies followed, standing in the industry, competitive attitude, and interest in buying orders etc.C. EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF THE SUPPLIERThe purchase policy and procedure differ according to the type of items to be purchased. Hence,evolution and selection of the supplier differ accordingly. In the ‘purchasing handbook’ edited byAljian, it has been described that the following variables to be considered while evaluating thequotations of the suppliers:1. Cost FactorsPrice, transportation cost, installation cost if any, tooling and other operations cost, incidence ofsales tax and excise duty, terms of payment and cash discount are considered in cost factor.2. DeliveryRouting and F.O.B. terms are important in determining the point at which the title to the goodspasses from vendor to the buyer and the responsibility for the payment of the payment charges.3. Design and Specification FactorsSpecification compliance, specification deviations, specification advantages, important dimensionsand weights are considered in line with the demonstration of sample, experience of other users,after sale services etc.4. Legal FactorsLegal factors include warranty, cancellation provision, patent protection, public liability, federallaws and reputation compliance.5. Vendor RatingThe evaluation of supplier or vendor rating provides valuable information which help in improvingthe quality of the decision. In the vendor rating three basic aspects are considered namely quality,service and price. How much weight should be given to each of these factors is a matter ofjudgment and is decided according to the specific need of the organization. Quality would be themain consideration in the manufacturing of the electrical equipments while price would be theprime consideration in the product having a tense competitive market and for a company procuringits requirements under the blanket contract with agreed price, the supplier rating would be doneon the basis of two variables namely quality and delivery. The Development Project Committee of the National Association of Purchasing Agents(U.S.A.) has suggested following methods for evaluating the performance of past suppliers. 1. The categorical plan: Under this method the members of the buying staff related withthe supplier like receiving section, quality control department, manufacturing department etc., arerequired to assess the performance of each supplier. The rating sheets are provided with the recordof the supplier, their product and the list of factors for the evaluation purposes. The members ofthe buying staff are required to assign the plus or minus notations against each factor. The periodicmeetings, usually at the interval of one month, are held by senior man of the buying staff to considerthe individual rating of each section. The consolidation of the individual rating is done on the basisof the net plus value and accordingly, the suppliers are assigned the categories such as ‘preferred’,‘neutral’ or ‘unsatisfactory’. Such ratings are used for the future guidance. &amp;$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT This is a very simple and inexpensive method. However, it is not precise. Its quality heavilydepends on the experience and ability of the buyer to judge the situation. As compared to othermethods, the degree of subjective judgment is very high as rating is based on personal whim andthe vague impressions of the buyer. As the quantitative data supported by the profits do not exist,it is not possible to institute any corrective action with the vendor. The rating is done on the basisof memory, and thus it becomes only a routine exercise without any critical analysis. 2. The weighted-point method: The weighted-point method provides the quantitative datafor each factor of evaluation. The weights are assigned to each factor of evaluation accordingto the need of the organization, e.g., a company decides the three factors to be considered—quality, price and timely delivery. It assigns the relative weight to each of these factors as under: Quality ……… 50 points Price ……… 30 points Timely delivery ……… 20 points The evaluation of each supplier is made in accordance with the aforesaid factors andweights and the composite weighted-points are ascertained for each suppliers—A, B and C—are rated under this method. First of all the specific rating under each factor will be made andthen the consolidation of all the factors will be made for the purpose of judgment. Quality rating: Percentage of quantity accepted among the total quantity is called qualityrating. In other words, the quality of the materials is judged on the basis of the degree ofacceptance and rejections. For the purpose of comparison, the percentage degree of acceptancewill be calculated in relation to the total lots received. Price rating is done on the basis of netprice charged by the supplier. Timely delivery rating will be done comparing with the averagedelivery schedule of the supplier. 3. The cost-ratio plan: Under this method, the vendor rating is done on the basis of variouscosts incurred for procuring the materials from various suppliers. The cost-ratios are ascertaineddelivery etc. The cost-ratios are ascertained for the different rating variables such as quality,price, timely delivery etc. The cost-ratio is calculated in percentage on the basis of total individualcost and total value of purchases. At the end, all such cost-ratios will be adjusted with the quotedprice per unit. The plus cost-ratio will increase the unit price while the minus cost-ratio willdecrease the unit price. The net adjusted unit price will indicate the vendor rating. The vendorwith the lowest net adjusted unit price will be the best supplier and so on. Certain quality costscan be inspection cost, cost of defectives, reworking costs and manufacturing losses on rejecteditems etc. Certain delivery costs can be postage and telegrams, telephones and extra cost forquick delivery etc. VENDER RATING ILLUSTRATIONS ILLUSTRATION 1: The following information is available on 3 vendors: A, B andC. Using the data below, determine the best source of supply under weighed-point methodand substantiate your solution. Vendor A: Delivered ‘56’ lots, ‘3’ were rejected, ‘2’ were not according to the schedule. Vendor B: Supplied ‘38’ lots, ‘2’ were rejected, ‘3’ were late. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT&amp;% Vendor C: Finished ‘42’ lots, ‘4’ were defective, ‘5’ were delayed deliveries. Give 40 for quality and 30 weightage for service.

FORWARD BUYINGForward buying or committing an organization far into the future, usually for a year. Dependingupon the availability of the item, the financial policies, the economic order quantity, the quantitativediscounts, and the staggered delivery, the future commitment is decided. This type of forwardbuying is different from speculative buying where the motive is to make capital out of the pricechanges, by selling the purchased items. Manufacturing organizations normally do not indulge insuch buying. However, a few organizations do ‘Hedge’, particularly in the commodity market byselling or buying contracts.2. TENDER BUYINGIn public, all semblance of favouritism, personal preferences should be avoided. As such, it iscommon for government departments and public sector undertakings to purchase through tenders.Private sector organizations adopt tender buying if the value of purchases is more than theprescribed limits as Rs. 50000 or Rs. 100000. The steps involved are to establish a bidders’ list,solicit bids by comparing quotations and place the order with the lowest bidder. However, care hasto be taken that the lowest bidder is responsible party and is capable of meeting the deliveryschedule and quality requirements. Open tender system or advertisement in newspapers is commonin public sector organizations. As advertising bids is costly and time consuming, most private sectororganizations solicit tenders only from the renowned suppliers capable of supplying the materials.3. BLANKET ORDER SYSTEMThis system minimizes the administrative expenses and is useful for ‘C’ type items. It is anagreement to provide a required quantity of specified items, over a period of time, usually for oneyear, at an agreed price. Deliveries are made depending upon the buyer’s needs. The systemrelieves the buyers from routine work, giving him more time for focusing attention on high valueitems. It requires fewer purchase orders and thus reduces clerical work. It often achieves lowerprices through quantity discounts by grouping the requirements. The supplier, under the systemmaintains adequate inventory to meet the blanket orders.4. ZERO STOCKSome firms try to operate on the basis of zero stock and the supplier holds the stock for thesefirms. Usually, the firms of the buyer and seller are close to each other so that the raw materials MATERIALS MANAGEMENT&amp;of one is the finished products of another. Alternatively, the system could work well if the sellerholds the inventory and if the two parties work in close coordination. However, the price per itemin this system will be slightly higher as the supplier will include the inventory carrying cost in theprice. In this system, the buyer need not lock up the capital and so the purchasing routine isreduced. This is also significantly reduces obsolescence of inventory, lead time and clericalefforts in paper work. Thus, the seller can devote his marketing efforts to other customers andproduction scheduling becomes easy.5. RATE CONTRACTThe system of rate contract is prevalent in public sector organizations and government departments.It is common for the suppliers to advertise that they are on ‘rate contract’ for the specific period.After negotiations, the seller and the buyer agree to the rates of items. Application of ratecontract has helped many organizations to cut down the internal administrative lead time asindividual firms need to go through the central purchasing departments and can place ordersdirectly with the suppliers. However, suppliers always demand higher prices for prompt delivery,as rate difficulty has been avoided by ensuring the delivery of a minimum quantity at the agreedrates. This procedure of fixing a minimum quantity is called the running contract and is beingpractised by the railways. The buyer also has an option of increasing the quantity by 25% morethan the agreed quantity under this procedure.6. RECIPROCITYReciprocal buying means purchasing from one’s customers in preference to others. It is basedon the principle “if you kill my cat, I will kill your dog”, and “Do unto your customers as youwould have them do unto you”. Other things, like soundness from the ethics and economics pointof view being equal, the principles of reciprocity can be practiced. However, a purchasingexecutive should not indulge in reciprocity on his initiative when the terms and conditions are notequal with other suppliers. It is often sound that less efficient manufacturers and distributors gainby reciprocity what they are unable to gain by price and quality. Since this tends to discouragecompetition and might lead to higher process and fewer suppliers, reciprocity should be practisedon a selective basis.7. SYSTEMS CONTRACTThis is a procedure intender to help the buyer and the sellers to reduce administrative expensesand at the same time ensure suitable controls. In this system, the original indent, duly approvedby competent authorities, is shipped back with the items and avoids the usual documents likepurchase orders, materials requisitions, expediting letters and acknowledgements, delivery periodprice and invoicing procedure, Carborandum company in the US claims drastic reduction ininventory and elimination of 40000 purchase orders by adopting the system contracting procedure.It is suitable for low unit price items with high consumption. 4.5 STORES MANAGEMENTStores play a vital role in the operations of company. It is in direct touch with the user departmentsin its day-to-day activities. The most important purpose served by the stores is to provide PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTuninterrupted service to the manufacturing divisions. Further, stores are often equated directlywith money, as money is locked up in the stores.FUNCTIONS OF STORES The functions of stores can be classified as follows: 1. To receive raw materials, components, tools, equipment’s and other items and account for them. 2. To provide adequate and proper storage and preservation to the various items. 3. To meet the demands of the consuming departments by proper issues and account for the consumption. 4. To minimise obsolescence, surplus and scrap through proper codification, preservation and handling. 5. To highlight stock accumulation, discrepancies and abnormal consumption and effect control measures. 6. To ensure good house keeping so that material handling, material preservation, stocking, receipt and issue can be done adequately. 7. To assist in verification and provide supporting information for effective purchase action.4.5.1 CodificationIt is one of the functions of stores management. Codification is a process of representing eachitem by a number, the digit of which indicates the group, the sub-group, the type and thedimension of the item. Many organizations in the public and private sectors, railways have theirown system of codification, varying from eight to thirteen digits. The first two digits representsthe major groups, such as raw materials, spare parts, sub-contracted items, hardware items,packing material, tools, oil, stationery etc. The next two digits indicate the sub-groups, such as,ferrous, non-ferrous etc. Dimensional characteristics of length, width, head diameter etc. constitutefurther three digits and the last digit is reserved for minor variations. Whatever may be the basis, each code should uniquely represent one item. It should besimple and capable of being understood by all. Codification should be compact, concise, consistentand flexible enough to accommodate new items. The groupings should be logical, holding similarparts near to one another. Each digit must be significant enough to represent some characteristicof the item.Objectives of Codification The objectives of a rationalized material coding system are: 1. Bringing all items together. 2. To enable putting up of any future item in its proper place. 3. To classify an item according to its characteristics. 4. To give an unique code number to each item to avoid duplication and ambiguity. 5. To reveal excessive variety and promote standardization and variety reduction. 6. To establish a common language for the identification of an item. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT  7. To fix essential parameters for specifying an item. 8. To specify item as per national and international standards. 9. To enable data processing and analysis.Advantages of CodificationAs a result of rationalized codification, many firms have reduced the number of items. It enablessystematic grouping of similar items and avoids confusion caused by long description of itemssince standardization of names is achieved through codification, it serves as the starting point ofsimplification and standardization. It helps in avoiding duplication of items and results in theminimisation of the number of items, leading to accurate record. Codification enables easyrecognition of an item in stores, thereby reducing clerical efforts to the minimum. If items arecoded according to the sources, it is possible to bulk the items while ordering. To maximise theaforesaid advantages, it is necessary to develop the codes as concerned, namely, personnel fromdesign, production, engineering, inspection, maintenance and materials. 4.6 INVENTORY CONTROL OR MANAGEMENT4.6.1 Meaning of InventoryInventory generally refers to the materials in stock. It is also called the idle resource of anenterprise. Inventories represent those items which are either stocked for sale or they are in theprocess of manufacturing or they are in the form of materials, which are yet to be utilised. Theinterval between receiving the purchased parts and transforming them into final products variesfrom industries to industries depending upon the cycle time of manufacture. It is, therefore,necessary to hold inventories of various kinds to act as a buffer between supply and demand forefficient operation of the system. Thus, an effective control on inventory is a must for smoothand efficient running of the production cycle with least interruptions.4.6.2 Reasons for Keeping Inventories 1. To stabilise production: The demand for an item fluctuates because of the number offactors, e.g., seasonality, production schedule etc. The inventories (raw materials and components)should be made available to the production as per the demand failing which results in stock outand the production stoppage takes place for want of materials. Hence, the inventory is kept totake care of this fluctuation so that the production is smooth. 2. To take advantage of price discounts: Usually the manufacturers offer discount forbulk buying and to gain this price advantage the materials are bought in bulk even though it isnot required immediately. Thus, inventory is maintained to gain economy in purchasing. 3. To meet the demand during the replenishment period: The lead time for procurementof materials depends upon many factors like location of the source, demand supply condition, etc.So inventory is maintained to meet the demand during the procurement (replenishment) period. 4. To prevent loss of orders (sales): In this competitive scenario, one has to meet thedelivery schedules at 100 per cent service level, means they cannot afford to miss the deliveryschedule which may result in loss of sales. To avoid the organizations have to maintain inventory. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 5. To keep pace with changing market conditions: The organizations have to anticipatethe changing market sentiments and they have to stock materials in anticipation of non-availabilityof materials or sudden increase in prices. 6. Sometimes the organizations have to stock materials due to other reasons like suppliersminimum quantity condition, seasonal availability of materials or sudden increase in prices.4.6.3 Meaning of Inventory ControlInventory control is a planned approach of determining what to order, when to order and how muchto order and how much to stock so that costs associated with buying and storing are optimal withoutinterrupting production and sales. Inventory control basically deals with two problems: (i) Whenshould an order be placed? (Order level), and (ii) How much should be ordered? (Order quantity). These questions are answered by the use of inventory models. The scientific inventorycontrol system strikes the balance between the loss due to non-availability of an item and costof carrying the stock of an item. Scientific inventory control aims at maintaining optimum levelof stock of goods required by the company at minimum cost to the company.4.6.4 Objectives of Inventory Control 1. To ensure adequate supply of products to customer and avoid shortages as far as possible. 2. To make sure that the financial investment in inventories is minimum (i.e., to see that the working capital is blocked to the minimum possible extent). 3. Efficient purchasing, storing, consumption and accounting for materials is an important objective. 4. To maintain timely record of inventories of all the items and to maintain the stock within the desired limits. 5. To ensure timely action for replenishment. 6. To provide a reserve stock for variations in lead times of delivery of materials. 7. To provide a scientific base for both short-term and long-term planning of materials.4.6.5 Benefits of Inventory ControlIt is an established fact that through the practice of scientific inventory control, following are thebenefits of inventory control: 1. Improvement in customer’s relationship because of the timely delivery of goods and service. 2. Smooth and uninterrupted production and, hence, no stock out. 3. Efficient utilisation of working capital. Helps in minimising loss due to deterioration, obsolescence damage and pilferage. 4. Economy in purchasing. 5. Eliminates the possibility of duplicate ordering. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT !4.6.6 Techniques of Inventory ControlIn any organization, depending on the type of business, inventory is maintained. When the numberof items in inventory is large and then large amount of money is needed to create such inventory,it becomes the concern of the management to have a proper control over its ordering, procurement,maintenance and consumption. The control can be for order quality and order frequency. The different techniques of inventory control are: (1) ABC analysis, (2) HML analysis,(3) VED analysis, (4) FSN analysis, (5) SDE analysis, (6) GOLF analysis and (7) SOS analysis.The most widely used method of inventory control is known as ABC analysis. In this technique,the total inventory is categorised into three sub-heads and then proper exercise is exercised foreach sub-heads. 1. ABC analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based on annualconsumption and the annual value of the items. Hence we obtain the quantity of inventory itemconsumed during the year and multiply it by unit cost to obtain annual usage cost. The items arethen arranged in the descending order of such annual usage cost. The analysis is carried out bydrawing a graph based on the cumulative number of items and cumulative usage of consumptioncost. Classification is done as follows: Table 4.1 Category Percentage of items Percentage of annual consumption value A 10–20 70–80 B 20–30 10–25 C 60–70 5–15 The classification of ABC analysis is shown by the graph given as follows (Fig. 4.5). Fig. 4.5 ABC classification &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Once ABC classification has been achieved, the policy control can be formulated as follows: A-Item: Very tight control, the items being of high value. The control need be exercised athigher level of authority. B-Item: Moderate control, the items being of moderate value. The control need be exercisedat middle level of authority. C-Item: The items being of low value, the control can be exercised at gross root level ofauthority, i.e., by respective user department managers. 2. HML analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based on unitprice of the items. They are classified as high price, medium price and low cost items. 3. VED analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based on criticalityof the items. They are classified as vital, essential and desirable items. It is mainly used in spareparts inventory. 4. FSN analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based consumptionof the items. They are classified as fast moving, slow moving and non-moving items. 5. SDE analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based on theitems. 6. GOLF analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based sourcesof the items. They are classified as Government supply, ordinarily available, local availability andforeign source of supply items. 7. SOS analysis: In this analysis, the classification of existing inventory is based nature ofsupply of items. They are classified as seasonal and off-seasonal items. For effective inventory control, combination of the techniques of ABC with VED or ABCwith HML or VED with HML analysis is practically used.4.6.7 Inventory ModelECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY (EOQ)Inventory models deal with idle resources like men, machines, money and materials. Thesemodels are concerned with two decisions: how much to order (purchase or produce) and whento order so as to minimize the total cost. For the first decision—how much to order, there are two basic costs are considered namely,inventory carrying costs and the ordering or acquisition costs. As the quantity ordered is increased,the inventory carrying cost increases while the ordering cost decreases. The ‘order quantity’means the quantity produced or procured during one production cycle. Economic order quantityis calculated by balancing the two costs. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is that size of orderwhich minimizes total costs of carrying and cost of ordering. i.e., Minimum Total Cost occurs when Inventory Carrying Cost = Ordering Cost Economic order quantity can be determined by two methods: 1. Tabulation method. 2. Algebraic method. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT # Fig. 4.6 Inventory cost curve1. Determination of EOQ by Tabulation (Trial&amp;Error) Method This method involves the following steps: 1. Select the number of possible lot sizes to purchase. 2. Determine average inventory carrying cost for the lot purchased. 3. Determine the total ordering cost for the orders placed. 4. Determine the total cost for each lot size chosen which is the summation of inventory carrying cost and ordering cost. 5. Select the ordering quantity, which minimizes the total cost. The data calculated in a tabular column can plotted showing the nature of total cost,inventory cost and ordering cost curve against the quantity ordered as in Fig. 4.6. ILLUSTRATION 3: The XYZ Ltd. carries a wide assortment of items for its customers.One of its popular items has annual demand of 8000 units. Ordering cost per order isfound to be Rs. 12.5. The carrying cost of average inventory is 20% per year and thecost per unit is Re. 1.00. Determine the optimal economic quantity and make yourrecommendations. SOLUTION: No. of Lot size Average Carrying Ordering Total cost/ orders/ (2) inventory (3) cost (4) cost (5) year year (1) (6) =(4) + (5) 1 8000 4000 800.00 12.5 812.50 2 4000 2000 400.00 25 425.00 4 2000 1000 200.00 50 250.00 8 1000 500 100.00 100 200.00 12 666.667 333.333 66.67 150 216.67 16 500 250 50.00 200 250.00 $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The table and the graph indicates that an order size of 1000 units will gives the lowest totalcost among the different alternatives. It also shows that minimum total cost occurs when carryingcost is equal to ordering cost.2. Determination of EOQ by Analytical Method In order to derive an economic lot size formula following assumptions are made: 1. Demand is known and uniform. 2. Let D denotes the total number of units purchase/produced and Q denotes the lot size in each production run. 3. Shortages are not permitted, i.e., as soon as the level of the inventory reaches zero, the inventory is replenished. 4. Production or supply of commodity is instantaneous. 5. Lead-time is zero. 6. Set-up cost per production run or procurement cost is C3. 7. Inventory carrying cost is C1 = CI, where C is the unit cost and I is called inventory carrying cost expressed as a percentage of the value of the average inventory. This fundamental situation can be shown on an inventory-time diagram, (Fig. 4.7) with Qon the vertical axis and the time on the horizontal axis. The total time period (one year) is dividedinto n parts. Fig. 4.7 MATERIALS MANAGEMENT % The most economic point in terms of total inventory cost exists where, Inventory carrying cost = Annual ordering cost (set-up cost) Average inventory = 1/2 (maximum level + minimum level) = (Q + 0)/2 = Q/2 Total inventory carrying cost = Average inventory × Inventory carrying cost per unit i.e., Total inventory carrying cost = Q/2 × C1 = QC1/2 …(1) Total annual ordering costs = Number of orders per year × Ordering cost per order i.e., Total annual ordering costs = (D/Q) × C3 = (D/Q)C3 …(2) Now, summing up the total inventory cost and the total ordering cost, we get the totalinventory cost C(Q). i.e., Total cost of production run = Total inventory carrying cost + Total annual ordering costs C(Q) = QC1/2 + (D/Q)C3 (cost equation) …(3) But, the total cost is minimum when the inventory carrying costs becomes equal to the totalannual ordering costs. Therefore, QC1/2 = (D/Q)C3or QC1 = (2D/Q)C3 or Q2 = 2C3D/C1 2C3 Dor Q = C1 2C3 D i.e., Optimal quantity (EOQ), Q0 = C1 ...(4) D Optimum number of orders, (N0) = Q ...(5) 0 365 1 Q0 Optimum order interval, (t0) = in days = N in years or (t0) = ...(6) N0 0 D Average yearly cost (TC) = 2C3 DC1 …(7) ILLUSTRATION 4: An oil engine manufacturer purchases lubricants at the rate ofRs. 42 per piece from a vendor. The requirements of these lubricants are 1800 per year.What should be the ordering quantity per order, if the cost per placement of an order isRs. 16 and inventory carrying charges per rupee per year is 20 paise. SOLUTION: Given data are: Number of lubricants to be purchased, D = 1800 per year Procurement cost, C3 = Rs. 16 per order Inventory carrying cost, CI = C1 = Rs. 42 × Re. 0.20 = Rs. 8.40 per year 2C3 D Then, optimal quantity (EOQ), Q0 = C1 2 × 16 × 1800 Q0 = = 82.8 or 83 lubricants (approx). 8.4 &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT ILLUSTRATION 5: A manufacturing company purchase 9000 parts of a machinefor its annual requirements ordering for month usage at a time, each part costs Rs. 20. Theordering cost per order is Rs. 15 and carrying charges are 15% of the average inventoryper year. You have been assigned to suggest a more economical purchase policy for thecompany. What advice you offer and how much would it save the company per year? SOLUTION: Given data are: Number of lubricants to be purchased, D = 9000 parts per year Cost of part, Cs = Rs. 20 Procurement cost, C3 = Rs. 15 per order Inventory carrying cost, CI = C1 = 15% of average inventory per year = Rs. 20 × 0.15 = Rs. 3 per each part per year 2C3 D Then, optimal quantity (EOQ), Q0 = C1 2 × 15 × 9000 Q0 = = 300 units 3 Q0 300 1and Optimum order interval, (t0) = in years = = years D 9000 30 1 = × 365 days = 122 Days 30 Minimum average cost = 2C3 DC1 = 2 × 3 ×15 × 9000 = Rs. 900 If the company follows the policy of ordering every month, then the annual ordering costis = Rs 12 × 15 = Rs. 180 Lot size of inventory each month = 9000/12 = 750 Q Average inventory at any time = = 750/2 = 375 2 Therefore,storage cost at any time = 375 × C1 = 375 × 3 = Rs. 1125 Total annual cost = 1125 + 180 = Rs. 1305 Hence, the company should purchase 300 parts at time interval of 1/30 year instead ofordering 750 parts each month. The net saving of the company will be = Rs. 1305 – Rs. 900 = Rs. 405 per year. 4.7 STANDARDIZATIONStandardization means producing maximum variety of products from the minimum variety ofmaterials, parts, tools and processes. It is the process of establishing standards or units ofmeasure by which extent, quality, quantity, value, performance etc., may be compared andmeasured. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT 4.7.1 Advantages of StandardizationAll the sections of company will be benefited from standardization as mentioned below.Benefits to Design Department 1.

More time is available to the supervisors to make useful records and preserve statistics. 4. Reduced reductions and scrap. 5. Helps supervisors to run his department efficiently and effectively.4.7.2 Disadvantages of Standardization Following are the disadvantages of standardization: 1. Reduction in choice because of reduced variety and consequently loss of business or customer. 2. Standard once set, resist change and thus standardization may become an obstacle to progress. 3. It tends to favour only large companies. 4. It becomes very difficult to introduce new models because of less flexible production facilities and due to high cost of specialised production equipment. 4.8 SIMPLIFICATIONThe concept of simplification is closely related to standardization. Simplification is the process ofreducing the variety of products manufactured. Simplification is concerned with the reduction ofproduct range, assemblies, parts, materials and design.4.8.1 Advantages of Simplification Following are the advantages of simplification: 1. Simplification involves fewer, parts, varieties and changes in products; this reduces manufacturing operations and risk of obsolescence. 2. Simplification reduces variety, volume of remaining products may be increased. 3. Simplification provides quick delivery and better after-sales services. 4. Simplification reduces inventory and thus results in better inventory control. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT  5. Simplification lowers the production costs. 6. Simplification reduces price of a product. 7. Simplification improves product quality. 4.9 VALUE ANALYSISValue engineering or value analysis had its birth during the World War II Lawrence D. Mileswas responsible for developing the technique and naming it. Value analysis is defined as “anorganized creative approach which has its objective, the efficient identification of unnecessarycost-cost which provides neither quality nor use nor life nor appearance nor customer features.”Value analysis focuses engineering, manufacturing and purchasing attention to one objective-equivalent performance at a lower cost. Value analysis is concerned with the costs added due to inefficient or unnecessary specificationsand features. It makes its contribution in the last stage of product cycle, namely, the maturity stage.At this stage, research and development no longer make positive contributions in terms of improvingthe efficiency of the functions of the product or adding new functions to it. Value is not inherent in a product, it is a relative term, and value can change with time andplace. It can be measured only by comparison with other products which perform the samefunction. Value is the relationship between what someone wants and what he is willing to pay forit. In fact, the heart of value analysis technique is the functional approach. It relates to cost offunction whereas others relate cost to product. It is denoted by the ratio between function and cost. Function Value = Cost4.9.1 Value Analysis FrameworkThe basic framework for value analysis approach is formed by the following questions, as givenby Lawrence D. Miles: 1. What is the item? 2. What does it do? 3. What does it cost? 4. What else would do the job? 5. What would the alternative cost be? Value analysis requires these questions to be answered for the successful implementationof the technique.4.9.2 Steps in Value AnalysisIn order to answer the above questions, three basic steps are necessary: 1. Identifying the function: Any useful product has some primary function which must beidentified—a bulb to give light, a refrigerator to preserve food, etc. In addition it may havesecondary functions such as withstanding shock, etc. These two must be identified. 2. Evaluation of the function by comparison: Value being a relative term, the comparison PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTapproach must be used to evaluate functions. The basic question is, ‘Does the function accomplishreliability at the best cost’ and can be answered only comparison. 3. Develop alternatives: Realistic situations must be faced, objections should overcomeand effective engineering manufacturing and other alternatives must be developed. In order todevelop effective alternatives and identify unnecessary cost the following thirteen value analysisprinciples must be used: 1. Avoid generalities. 2. Get all available costs. 3. Use information only from the best source. 4. Brain-storming sessions. 5. Blast, create and refine: In the blast stage, alternative productive products, materials, processes or ideas are generated. In the ‘create’ stage the ideas generated in the blast stage are used to generate alternatives which accomplish the function almost totally. In the refining stage the alternatives generated are sifted and refined so as to arrive at the final alternative to be implemented. 6. Identify and overcome road blocks. 7. Use industry specialists to extend specialised knowledge. 8. Key tolerance not to be too light. 9. Utilise the pay for vendors’ skills techniques. 10. Utilise vendors’ available functional products. 11. Utilise speciality processes. 12. Utilise applicable standards. 13. Use the criterion ‘Would I spend my money this way?’ 4.10 ERGONOMICS (HUMAN ENGINEERING)The word ‘Ergonomics’ has its origin in two Greek words Ergon meaning laws. So it is thestudy of the man in relation to his work. In USA and other countries it is called by the name‘human engineering or human factors engineering”. ILO defines human engineering as, “Theapplication of human biological sciences along with engineering sciences to achieve optimummutual adjustment of men and his work, the benefits being measured in terms of humanefficiency and well-being.” The human factors or human engineering is concerned with man-machine system. Thusanother definition which highlights the man-machine system is: “The design of human tasks,man-machine system, and effective accomplishment of the job, including displays for presentinginformation to human sensors, controls for human operations and complex man-machinesystems.” Human engineering focuses on human beings and their interaction with products, equipmentfacilities and environments used in the work. Human engineering seeks to change the thingspeople use and the environment in which they use the things to match in a better way thecapabilities, limitations and needs of people. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT !4.10.1 Objectives of Human Engineering Human engineering (ergonomics) has two broader objectives: 1. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness with which the activities (work) is carried out so as to increase the convenience of use, reduced errors and increase in productivity. 2. To enhance certain desirable human values including safety reduced stress and fatigue and improved quality of life. Thus, in general the scope and objective of ergonomics is “designing for human use andoptimising working and living conditions”. Thus human factors (ergonomics) discover and applyinformation about human behaviour. Abilities and limitations and other characteristics to thedesign of tools, machines, systems, tasks, jobs and environment for productive, safe, comfortableand effective human use. Ergonomics aims at providing comfort and improved working conditionsso as to channelise the energy, skills of the workers into constructive productive work. Thisaccounts for increased productivity, safety and reduces the fatigue. This helps to increase theplant utilisation. 4.11 JUST-IN-TIME (JIT) MANUFACTURINGIntroductionJust-In-Time (JIT) Manufacturing is a philosophy rather than a technique. By eliminating allwaste and seeking continuous improvement, it aims at creating manufacturing system that isresponse to the market needs. The phase just in time is used to because this system operates with low WIP (Work-In-Process) inventory and often with very low finished goods inventory. Products are assembled justbefore they are sold, subassemblies are made just before they are assembled and componentsare made and fabricated just before subassemblies are made. This leads to lower WIP andreduced lead times. To achieve this organizations have to be excellent in other areas e.g. quality. According to Voss, JIT is viewed as a “Production methodology which aims to improveoverall productivity through elimination of waste and which leads to improved quality”.JIT provides an efficient production in an organization and delivery of only the necessary partsin the right quantity, at the right time and place while using the minimum facilities”.4.11.1 Seven WastesShiego Shingo, a Japanese JIT authority and engineer at the Toyota Motor Company identifiesseven wastes as being the targets of continuous improvement in production process. By attendingto these wastes, the improvement is achieved. 1. Waste of over production eliminate by reducing set-up times, synchronizing quantities and timing between processes, layout problems. Make only what is needed now. 2. Waste of waiting eliminate bottlenecks and balance uneven loads by flexible work force and equipment. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 3. Waste of transportation establish layouts and locations to make handling and transport unnecessary if possible. Minimise transportation and handling if not possible to eliminate. 4. Waste of processing itself question regarding the reasons for existence of the product and then why each process is necessary. 5. Waste of stocks reducing all other wastes reduces stocks. Fig. 4.8 Wastes in operations 6. Waste of motion study for economy and consistency. Economy improves productivity and consistency improves quality. First improve the motions, then mechanise or automate otherwise. There is danger of automating the waste. 7. Waste of making defective products develop the production process to prevent defects from being produced, so as to eliminate inspection. At each process, do not accept defects and makes no defects. Make the process fail-safe. A quantify process always yield quality product.4.11.2 Benefits of JITThe most significant benefit is to improve the responsiveness of the firm to the changes in themarket place thus providing an advantage in competition. Following are the benefits of JIT: 1. Product cost—is greatly reduced due to reduction of manufacturing cycle time, reduction of waste and inventories and elimination of non-value added operation. 2. Quality—is improved because of continuous quality improvement programmes. 3. Design—Due to fast response to engineering change, alternative designs can be quickly brought on the shop floor. 4. Productivity improvement. 5. Higher production system flexibility. 6. Administrative and ease and simplicity. MATERIALS MANAGEMENT # EXERCISESSection A 1.

A variety of basic grain and filler ingredients is mixedin batches. The mixture is then fed to an intermediate storage hoper, from which it is conveyedto a bagging operation. The bags of feed are then loaded on pallets and moved to the nearbywarehouse for storage. A foreman supervises the operations. A full-time worker who operates the mixing andblending equipment, plus four full-time and 10 part-time workers provide direct labor. The foremanis paid Rs.15, 000 per year; the mixer-operator, Rs. 5 per hour; the other full-time workers,Rs. 4 per hour; and the 10 part-time workers, Rs. 3 per hour. The usual routine for a production run is as follows: The foreman receives job tickets fromthe office indicating the quantities to be run and the formula. The job tickers are placed in theorder in which they are to be processed. At the end of a run, the foreman purges the mixingsystem and ducts of the previous product. This takes 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the foreman has directed the mixer-operator and the four full-time employeesto obtain the required ingredients for the next product from the storeroom. When the mixingequipment has been purged, the mixer and gets it started. This takes about 10 minutes. The totaltime spent by the mixer-operates in obtaining materials and loading the mixer is 30 minutes. Thefour full-time employees devote 30 minutes to obtaining materials. While the previous activities are being performed the foreman turns his attention to thebagger line, which requires minor change over for bag size and the product identifying lable thatis sewed to the top of bag as it is sewed closed. While the foreman is purging the system, the 10 part-time employees transfer what is leftof the last run to the warehouse, which requires about 15 minutes. They then idle until the finishedgoods warehouse is valued according to the sale price of each item, which is about Rs. 5 per100 kg. The cost of placing items in the warehouse has been calculated as approximatelyRe. 0.20 per 100 kg, based on the time required for one of the part-time workers to truck it tothe warehouse and place it in the proper location. The front office has calculated that the storagespace in the owned warehouse is worth about Rs. 10 per square foot per year, but because thebags are palletized and stacked 12 feet high, this cost has been reduced to only Re. 0.20 per 100kg per year. The product mixes are stable, and there is very little risk of obsolescence. Thereis some loss because uninvited guests (rats, etc.) come in to dine. The total storage andobsolescence costs ate estimated as 5 per cent of inventory value. The Mixing and Bagging Company has a factory overhead rate that it applied to materialsand direct labor. This overhead rate is currently 100 percent and is applied to the averagematerial cost of Rs. 1.87 per 10 kg plus direct labor costs of Re. 0.13 per 10 kg. The companyearns 8 per cent after taxes and can borrow at the local bank at an interest rate of 9 per cent. The factory manager is currently reviewing the bases for deciding the length of productionruns for products. He figures that operations are currently at about 85 per cent of capacity. Hehas heard of EOQ as a basis for setting the length of production runs. What values should heassign to cp and cH for his operations?

Once the plan is prepared, then execution of plan is performed in line with the details givenin the plan. Production control comes into action if there is any deviation between the actual andplanned. The corrective action is taken so as to achieve the targets set as per plan by usingcontrol techniques. Thus production planning and control can be defined as the “direction and coordinationof firms’ resources towards attaining the prefixed goals.” Production planning and controlhelps to achieve uninterrupted flow of materials through production line by making available thematerials at right time and required quantity. 107 &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 5.2 NEED FOR PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROLThe present techno-economic scenario of India emphasize on competitiveness in manufacturing.Indian industries have to streamline the production activities and attain the maximum utilisationof firms’ resources to enhance the productivity. Production planning and control serves as auseful tool to coordinate the activities of the production system by proper planning and controlsystem. Production system can be compared to the nervous system with PPC as a brain.Production planning and control is needed to achieve: 1. Effective utilisation of firms’ resources. 2. To achieve the production objectives with respect to quality, quantity, cost and timeliness of delivery. 3. To obtain the uninterrupted production flow in order to meet customers varied demand with respect to quality and committed delivery schedule. 4. To help the company to supply good quality products to the customer on the continuous basis at competitive rates. Production planning is a pre-production activity. It is the pre-determination of manufacturingrequirements such as manpower, materials, machines and manufacturing process. Ray wild defines “Production planning is the determination, acquisition and arrangementof all facilities necessary for future production of products.” It represents the design ofproduction system. Apart from planning the resources, it is going to organize the production. Based on the estimated demand for company’s products, it is going to establish the productionprogramme to meet the targets set using the various resources.Production ControlInspite of planning to the minute details, most of the time it is not possible to achieve production100 per cent as per the plan. There may be innumerable factors which affect the production systemand because of which there is a deviation from the actual plan. Some of the factors that affect are: 1. Non-availability of materials (due to shortage, etc.); 2. Plant, equipment and machine breakdown; 3. Changes in demand and rush orders; 4. Absenteeism of workers; and 5. Lack of coordination and communication between various functional areas of business. Thus, if there is a deviation between actual production and planned production, the controlfunction comes into action. Production control through control mechanism tries to take correctiveaction to match the planned and actual production. Thus, production control reviews the progressof the work, and takes corrective steps in order to ensure that programmed production takesplace. The essential steps in control activity are: 1. Initiating the production, 2. Progressing, and 3. Corrective action based upon the feedback and reporting back to the production planning. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  5.3 OBJECTIVES OF PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROLFollowing are the objectives of production planning and control: 1. Systematic planning of production activities to achieve the highest efficiency in production of goods/services. 2. To organize the production facilities like machines, men, etc., to achieve stated production objectives with respect to quantity and quality time and cost. 3. Optimum scheduling of resources. 4. Coordinate with other departments relating to production to achieve regular balanced and uninterrupted production flow. 5. To conform to delivery commitments. 6. Materials planning and control. 7. To be able to make adjustments due to changes in demand and rush orders. 5.4 PHASES OF PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROLProduction planning and control has three phases namely: A. Planning Phase B. Action Phase C. Control Phase Fig. 5.1 Phases of production planning and control PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT5.4.1 Planning Phase Planning is an exercise of intelligent anticipation in order to establish how an objective canbe achieved or a need fulfilled in circumstances, which are invariably restrictive. Productionplanning determines the optimal schedule and sequence of operations economic batch quantity,machine assignment and dispatching priorities for sequencing. It has two categories of planning namely 1. Prior planning 2. Active planning.PRIOR PLANNINGPrior planning means pre-production planning. This includes all the planning efforts, which aretaking place prior to the active planning.Modules of pre-planning The modules of prior planning are as follows: 1. Product development and design is the process of developing a new product with all the features, which are essential for effective use in the field, and designing it accordingly. At the design stage, one has to take several aspects of design like, design for selling, design for manufacturing and design for usage. 2. Forecasting is an estimate of demand, which will happen in future. Since, it is only an estimate based on the past demand, proper care must be taken while estimating it. Given the sales forecast, the factory capacity, the aggregate inventory levels and size of the work force, the manager must decide at what rate of production to operate the plant over an intermediate planning horizon. 3. Aggregate planning aims to find out a product wise planning over the intermediate planning horizon. 4. Material requirement planning is a technique for determining the quantity and timing for the acquisition of dependent items needed to satisfy the master production schedule.ACTIVE PLANNINGThe modules of active planning are: Process planning and routing, Materials planning. Toolsplanning, Loading, Scheduling etc. 1. Process planning and routing is a complete determination of the specific technological process steps and their sequence to produce products at the desired quality, quantity and cost. It determines the method of manufacturing a product selects the tools and equipments, analyses how the manufacturing of the product will fit into the facilities. Routing in particular prescribes the flow of work in the plant and it is related to the considerations of layout, temporary locations for raw materials and components and materials handling systems. 2. A material planning is a process which determines the requirements of various raw materials/subassemblies by considering the trade-off between various cost components like, carrying cost, ordering cost, shortage cost, and so forth. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  3. Tools’ planning determines the requirements of various tools by taking process specification (surface finish, length of the job, overall depth of cut etc.), material specifications (type of material used, hardness of the material, shape and size of the material etc.) and equipment specifications (speed range, feed range, depth of cut range etc.). 4. Loading is the process of assigning jobs to several machines such that there is a load balance among the machines. This is relatively a complex task, which can be managed with the help of efficient heuristic procedures. 5. Scheduling is the time phase of loading and determines when and in what sequence the work will be carried out. This fixes the starting as well as the finishing time for each job.5.4.2 Action PhaseAction phase has the major step of dispatching. Dispatching is the transition from planningphase to action phase. In this phase, the worker is ordered to start manufacturing the product.The tasks which are included in dispatching are job order, store issue order, tool order, time ticket,inspection order, move order etc. The job order number is the key item which is to be mentioned in all other reports/orders.Stores issue order gives instruction to stores to issue materials for manufacturing the productas per product specifications. As per tooling requirements for manufacturing the product, the toolorder instruct the tool room to issue necessary tools. Time ticket is nothing but a card whichis designed to note down the actual time taken at various processes. This information is used fordeciding the costs for future jobs of similar nature and also for performing variance analysis,which helps to exercise control. Job order is the official authorization to the shop floor to start manufacturing the product.Generally, the process sequence will contain some testing and inspection. So, these are to beinstructed to inspection wing in the form of inspection order for timely testing and inspection sothat the amount of rework is minimized. The manufacture of product involves moving rawmaterials/subassemblies to the main line. This is done by a well-designed materials handlingsystem. So, proper instruction is given to the materials handling facilities for major movementsof materials/subassemblies in the form of a move order. Movements which involve less distanceand fewer loads are managed at the shop floor level based on requests from operators.5.4.3 Control Phase The control phase has the following two major modules: 1. Progress reporting, and 2. Corrective action.1. PROGRESS REPORTINGIn progress reporting, the data regarding what is happening with the job is collected. Also, it helpsto make comparison with the present level of performance. The various data pertaining tomaterials rejection, process variations, equipment failures, operator efficiency, operator absenteeism,tool life, etc., are collected and analyzed for the purpose of progress reporting. These data are PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTused for performing variance analysis, which would help us to identify critical areas that deserveimmediate attention for corrective actions.2. CORRECTIVE ACTIONThe tasks under corrective action primarily make provisions for an unexpected event. Someexamples of corrective actions are creating schedule flexibility, schedule modifications, capacitymodifications, make or buy decisions, expediting the work, pre-planning, and so on. Due tounforeseen reasons such as, machine breakdown, labour absenteeism, too much rejection due topoor material quality etc., it may not be possible to realize the schedule as per the plan. Undersuch condition, it is better to reschedule the whole product mix so that we get a clear pictureof the situation to progress further. Under such situation, it is to be re-examined for selectingappropriate course of action. Expediting means taking action if the progress reporting indicatesdeviations from the originally set targets. Pre-planning of the whole affair becomes essential incase the expediting fails to bring the deviated plan to its right path. 5.5 FUNCTIONS OF PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROLFunctions of production planning and controlling is classified into: 1. Pre-planning fuction 2. Planning function 3. Control function The functions of production planning and controlling are depicted in the Fig. 5.2.1. PRE-PLANNING FUNCTIONPre-planning is a macro level planning and deals with analysis of data and is an outline of theplanning policy based upon the forecasted demand, market analysis and product design and Feedback Fig. 5.2 Functions of production planning and control PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL !development. This stage is concerned with process design (new processes and developments,equipment policy and replacement and work flow (Plant layout). The pre-planning function ofPPC is concerned with decision-making with respect to methods, machines and work flow withrespect to availability, scope and capacity.2. PLANNING FUNCTIONThe planning function starts once the task to be accomplished is specified, with the analysis offour M’s, i.e., Machines, Methods, Materials and Manpower. This is followed by processplanning (routing). Both short-term (near future) and long-term planning are considered.Standardisation, simplification of products and processes are given due consideration.3. CONTROL FUNCTIONControl phase is effected by dispatching, inspection and expediting materials control, analysis ofwork-in-process. Finally, evaluation makes the PPC cycle complete and corrective actions aretaken through a feedback from analysis. A good communication, and feedback system is essentialto enhance and ensure effectiveness of PPC.5.5.1 Parameters for PPC The functions of PPC can be explained with the following parameters: 1. Materials: Raw materials, finished parts and bought out components should be madeavailable in required quantities and at required time to ensure the correct start and end for eachoperation resulting in uninterrupted production. The function includes the specification of materials(quality and quantity) delivery dates, variety reduction (standardisation) procurement and makeor buy decisions. 2. Machines and equipment: This function is related with the detailed analysis of availableproduction facilities, equipment down time, maintenance policy procedure and schedules. Concernedwith economy of jigs and fixtures, equipment availability. Thus, the duties include the analysis offacilities and making their availability with minimum down time because of breakdowns. 3. Methods: This function is concerned with the analysis of alternatives and selection ofthe best method with due consideration to constraints imposed. Developing specifications forprocesses is an important aspect of PPC and determination of sequence of operations. 4. Process planning (Routing): It is concerned with selection of path or route which theraw material should follow to get transformed into finished product. The duties include: (a) Fixation of path of travel giving due consideration to layout. (b) Breaking down of operations to define each operation in detail. (c) Deciding the set up time and process time for each operation. 5. Estimating: Once the overall method and sequence of operations is fixed and processsheet for each operation is available, then the operations times are estimated. This function iscarried out using extensive analysis of operations along with methods and routing and a standardtime for operation are established using work measurement techniques. 6. Loading and scheduling: Scheduling is concerned with preparation of machine loadsand fixation of starting and completion dates for each of the operations. Machines have to be &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTloaded according to their capability of performing the given task and according to their capacity.Thus the duties include: (a) Loading, the machines as per their capability and capacity. (b) Determining the start and completion times for each operation. (c) To coordinate with sales department regarding delivery schedules. 7. Dispatching: This is the execution phase of planning. It is the process of setting productionactivities in motion through release of orders and instructions. It authorises the start of productionactivities by releasing materials, components, tools, fixtures and instruction sheets to the operator.The activities involved are: (a) To assign definite work to definite machines, work centres and men. (b) To issue required materials from stores. (c) To issue jigs, fixtures and make them available at correct point of use. (d) Release necessary work orders, time tickets, etc., to authorise timely start of operations. (e) To record start and finish time of each job on each machine or by each man. 8. Expediting: This is the control tool that keeps a close observation on the progress of thework. It is logical step after dispatching which is called ‘follow-up’. It coordinates extensively toexecute the production plan. Progressing function can be divided into three parts, i.e., follow upof materials, follow up of work-in-process and follow up of assembly. The duties include: (a) Identification of bottlenecks and delays and interruptions because of which the production schedule may be disrupted. (b) To devise action plans (remedies) for correcting the errors. (c) To see that production rate is in line with schedule. 9. Inspection: It is a major control tool. Though the aspects of quality control are theseparate function, this is of very much important to PPC both for the execution of the currentplans and its scope for future planning. This forms the basis for knowing the limitations withrespects to methods, processes, etc., which is very much useful for evaluation phase. 10. Evaluation: This stage though neglected is a crucial to the improvement of productiveefficiency. A thorough analysis of all the factors influencing the production planning and controlhelps to identify the weak spots and the corrective action with respect to pre-planning andplanning will be effected by a feedback. The success of this step depends on the communication,data and information gathering and analysis. 5.6 OPERATIONS PLANNING AND SCHEDULING SYSTEMSOperations planning and scheduling systems concern with the volume and timing of outputs, theutilisation of operations capacity at desired levels for competitive effectiveness. These systemsmust fit together activities at various levels, form top to bottom, in support of one another, asshown in Fig. 5.3. Note that the time orientation ranges from long to short as we progress fromtop to bottom in the hierarchy. Also, the level of detail in the planning process ranges from broadat the top to detail at the bottom. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL #Components of Operations Planning and Scheduling System1. THE BUSINESS PLANThe business plan is a statement of the organization’s overall level of business activity for thecoming six to eighteen months, usually expressed in terms of outputs (in volume of sales) for itsvarious product groups, a set of individual products that share or consume common blocks ofcapacity in the manufacturing process. It also specifies the overall inventory and backlog levelsthat will be maintained during the planning period. The business plan is an agreement betweenall functional areas—finance, production, marketing, engineering, R&amp;D—about the level ofactivity and the products they are committed to support. The business plan is not concerned withall the details and specific timing of the actions for executing the plan. Instead, it determines afeasible general posture for competing to achieve its major goals. The resulting plan guides thelower-level, more details decisions.2. AGGREGATE PRODUCTION (OUTPUT) PLANNINGThe process of determining output levels of product groups over the coming six to eighteenmonths on a weekly or monthly basis. It identifies the overall level of outputs in support of thebusiness plan. The plan recognizes the division’s existing fixed capacity and the company’soverall policies for maintaining inventories and backlogs, employment stability and subcontracting.3. AGGREGATE CAPACITY PLANNINGIt is the process of testing the feasibility of aggregate output plans and evaluating overall capacityutilisation. A statement of desired output is useful only if it is feasible. Thus, it addresses thesupply side of the firm’s ability to meet the demand. As for aggregate output plans, each plant,facility, or division requires its own aggregate capacity plan. Capacity and output must be inbalance, as indicated by the arrow between them in Fig. 5.3. A capacity plan translates an outputplan into input terms, approximating how much of the division’s capacity will be consumed.Although these basic capacities are fixed, management can manipulate the short-term capacitiesby the ways they deploy their work force, by subcontracting, or by using multiple work shiftsto adjust the timing of overall outputs. As a result, the aggregate planning process balances outputlevels, capacity constraints, and temporary capacity adjustments to meet demand and utilisecapacity at desired levels during the coming months. The resulting plan sets limits on the masterproduction schedule.4. MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULING (MPS)MPS is a schedule showing week by week how many of each product must be producedaccording to customer orders and demand forecasts. Its purpose is to meet the demand forindividual products in the product group. This more detailed level of planning disaggregates theproduct groups into individual products and indicates when they will be produced. The MPS isan important link between marketing and production. It shows when incoming sales orders canbe scheduled into production, and when each shipment can be scheduled for delivery. It alsotakes into account current backlogs so that production and delivery schedules are realistic. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Fig. 5.3 Operations planning and scheduling system5. RESOURCE REQUIREMENT PLANNINGResource requirement planning (rough-cut capacity planning) is the process of testing the feasibilityof master production schedule in terms of capacity. This step ensures that a proposed MPS doesnot inadvertently overload any key department, work centre, or machine, making the MPSunworkable.6. MATERIAL REQUIREMENT PLANNINGMaterial requirement planning (MRP) is a system of planning and scheduling the time phasedmaterial requirements for releasing materials and receiving materials that enable the masterproduction schedule to be implemented. Thus, the master production schedule is the driving force PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL %for material requirements planning. MRP provides information such as due dates for componentsthat are subsequently used for shop floor control. Once this information is available, it enablesmanagers to estimate the detailed requirements for each work centres.7. CAPACITY REQUIREMENT PLANNINGCapacity requirement planning (CRP) is an iterative process of modifying the MPS or plannedresources to make capacity consistent with the production schedule. CRP is a companion processused with MRP to identify in detail the capacity required to execute the material requirementplanning. At this level, more accurate comparisons of available and needed capacity for scheduledworkloads are possible.8. SHOP FLOOR CONTROLShop floor control involves the activities that execute and control shop operations namely loading,sequencing, detailed scheduling and expediting jobs in production. It coordinates the weekly anddaily activities that get jobs done. Individual jobs are assigned to machines and work centres(loading), the sequence of processing the jobs for priority control is determined, start times andjob assignments for each stage of processing are decided (detailed scheduling ) and materials andwork flows from station to station are monitored and adjusted (expediting).9. LOADINGEach job (customer order) may have its unique product specification and, hence, it is uniquethrough various work centres in the facility. As new job orders are released, they are assignedor allocated among the work centres, thus establishing how much of a load each work centremust carry during the coming planning period. This assignment is known as loading (sometimescalled shop loading as machine loading).10. SEQUENCINGThis stage establishes the priorities for jobs in the queues (waiting lines) at the work centres.Priority sequencing specifies the order in which the waiting jobs are processed; it requires theadoption of a priority sequencing rule.11. DETAILED SCHEDULINGDetailed scheduling determines start times, finish times and work assignments for all jobs at eachwork centre. Calendar times are specified when job orders, employees, and materials (inputs),as well as job completion (outputs), should occur at each work centre. By estimating how longeach job will take to complete and when it is due, schedulers can establish start and finish datesand develop the detailed schedule.12. EXPEDITINGExpediting is a process of tracking a job’s progress and taking special actions to move it throughthe facility. In tracking a job’s progress, special action may be needed to keep the job movingthrough the facility on time. Manufacturing or service operations disruptions-equipments breakdowns,unavailable materials, last-minute priority changes, require managers to deviate from plans andschedules and expedite an important job on a special handling basis. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT13. INPUT/OUTPUT CONTROLInput/output control related to the activities to monitor actual versus planned utilisation of a workcentre’s capacity. Output plans and schedules call for certain levels of capacity at a work centre,but actual utilisation may differ from what was planned. Actual versus planned utilisation of thework centre’s capacity can be monitored by using input-output reports and, when discrepanciesexist, adjustments can be made. The important components of operations planning and schedulingsystem has been explained in detail in the following paragraphs. 5.7 AGGREGATE PLANNINGAggregate planning is an intermediate term planning decision. It is the process of planning thequantity and timing of output over the intermediate time horizon (3 months to one year). Withinthis range, the physical facilities are assumed to –10 be fixed for the planning period. Therefore,fluctuations in demand must be met by varying labour and inventory schedule. Aggregate planningseeks the best combination to minimise costs.Aggregate Planning StrategiesThe variables of the production system are labour, materials and capital. More labour effort isrequired to generate higher volume of output. Hence, the employment and use of overtime (OT)are the two relevant variables. Materials help to regulate output. The alternatives available to thecompany are inventories, back ordering or subcontracting of items. These controllable variables constitute pure strategies by which fluctuations in demand anduncertainties in production activities can be accommodated by using the following steps: 1. Vary the size or the workforce: Output is controlled by hiring or laying off workers in proportion to changes in demand. 2. Vary the hours worked: Maintain the stable workforce, but permit idle time when there is a slack and permit overtime (OT) when demand is peak. 3. Vary inventory levels: Demand fluctuations can be met by large amount of inventory. 4. Subcontract: Upward shift in demand from low level. Constant production rates can be met by using subcontractors to provide extra capacity.Aggregate Planning Guidelines The following are the guidelines for aggregate planning: 1. Determine corporate policy regarding controllable variables. 2. Use a good forecast as a basis for planning. 3. Plan in proper units of capacity. 4. Maintain the stable workforce. 5. Maintain needed control over inventories. 6. Maintain flexibility to change. 7. Respond to demand in a controlled manner. 8. Evaluate planning on a regular base. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  5.8 MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE (MPS)Master scheduling follows aggregate planning. It expresses the overall plans in terms of specificend items or models that can be assigned priorities. It is useful to plan for the material andcapacity requirements. Flowchart of aggregate plan and master production schedule is shown in Fig. 5.4 Time interval used in master scheduling depends upon the type, volume, and component leadtimes of the products being produced. Normally weekly time intervals are used. The time horizoncovered by the master schedule also depends upon product characteristics and lead times. Somemaster schedules cover a period as short as few weeks and for some products it is more than a year.Functions of MPSMaster Production Schedule (MPS) gives a formal details of the production plan and convertsthis plan into specific material and capacity requirements. The requirements with respect tolabour, material and equipment is then assessed. The main functions of MPS are: 1. To translate aggregate plans into specific end items: Aggregate plan determines level of operations that tentatively balances the market demands with the material, labour and equipment capabilities of the company. A master schedule translates this plan into specific number of end items to be produced in specific time period. Fig. 5.4 Flowchart of aggregate plan and master schedule PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 2. Evaluate alternative schedules: Master schedule is prepared by trial and error. Many computer simulation models are available to evaluate the alternate schedules. 3. Generate material requirement: It forms the basic input for material requirement planning (MRP). 4. Generate capacity requirements: Capacity requirements are directly derived from MPS. Master scheduling is thus a prerequisite for capacity planning. 5. Facilitate information processing: By controlling the load on the plant. Master schedule determines when the delivery should be made. It coordinates with other management information systems such as, marketing, finance and personnel. 6. Effective utilization of capacity: By specifying end item requirements schedule establishes the load and utilization requirements for machines and equipment. 5.9 MATERIAL REQUIREMENT PLANNING (MRP)MRP refers to the basic calculations used to determine components required from end itemrequirements. It also refers to a broader information system that uses the dependence relationshipto plan and control manufacturing operations. “Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) is a technique for determining the quantityand timing for the acquisition of dependent demand items needed to satisfy master productionschedule requirements.”5.9.1 Objectives of MRP 1. Inventory reduction: MRP determines how many components are required when theyare required in order to meet the master schedule. It helps to procure the materials/ componentsas and when needed and thus avoid excessive build up of inventory. 2. Reduction in the manufacturing and delivery lead times: MRP identifies materialsand component quantities, timings when they are needed, availabilities and procurements andactions required to meet delivery deadlines. MRP helps to avoid delays in production and prioritiesproduction activities by putting due dates on customer job order. 3. Realistic delivery commitments: By using MRP, production can give marketing timelyinformation about likely delivery times to prospective customers. 4. Increased efficiency: MRP provides a close coordination among various work centresand hence help to achieve uninterrupted flow of materials through the production line. Thisincreases the efficiency of production system.5.9.2 MRP SystemThe inputs to the MRP system are: (1) A master production schedule, (2) An inventory statusfile and (3) Bill of materials (BOM). Using these three information sources, the MRP processing logic (computer programme)provides three kinds of information (output) for each product component: order release requirements,order rescheduling and planned orders. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL   Fig. 5.5 MRP system1. MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE (MPS)MPS is a series of time phased quantities for each item that a company produces, indicating how manyare to be produced and when. MPS is initially developed from firm customer orders or from forecastsof demand before MRP system begins to operate. The MRP system whatever the master scheduledemands and translates MPS end items into specific component requirements. Many systems makea simulated trial run to determine whether the proposed master can be satisfied.2. INVENTORY STATUS FILEEvery inventory item being planned must have an inventory status file which gives complete andup to date information on the on-hand quantities, gross requirements, scheduled receipts andplanned order releases for an item. It also includes planning information such as lot sizes, leadtimes, safety stock levels and scrap allowances.3. BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM)BOM identifies how each end product is manufactured, specifying all subcomponents items, theirsequence of build up, their quantity in each finished unit and the work centres performing the buildup sequence. This information is obtained from product design documents, workflow analysis andother standard manufacturing information. 5.10 CAPACITY PLANNINGDesign of the production system involves planning for the inputs, conversion process and outputsof production operation. The effective management of capacity is the most important responsibilityof production management. The objective of capacity management (i.e., planning and control ofcapacity) is to match the level of operations to the level of demand. Capacity planning is to be carried out keeping in mind future growth and expansion plans,market trends, sales forecasting, etc. It is a simple task to plan the capacity in case of stabledemand. But in practice the demand will be seldom stable. The fluctuation of demand createsproblems regarding the procurement of resources to meet the customer demand. Capacity decisions PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTare strategic in nature. Capacity is the rate of productive capability of a facility. Capacity isusually expressed as volume of output per period of time. Production managers are more concerned about the capacity for the following reasons: l Sufficient capacity is required to meet the customers demand in time. l Capacity affects the cost efficiency of operations. l Capacity affects the scheduling system. l Capacity creation requires an investment. Capacity planning is the first step when an organization decides to produce more or newproducts.5.10.1 Measurement of Capacity PlanningThe capacity of the manufacturing unit can be expressed in number of units of output per period.In some situations measuring capacity is more complicated when they manufacture multipleproducts. In such situations, the capacity is expressed as man-hours or machine hours. Therelationship between capacity and output is shown in Fig. 5.6. 1. Design capacity: Designed capacity of a facility is the planned or engineered rate ofoutput of goods or services under normal or full scale operating conditions. For example, the designed capacity of the cement plant is 100 TPD (Tonnes per day).Capacity of the sugar factory is 150 tonnes of sugarcane crushing per day. 2. System capacity: System capacity is the maximum output of the specific product orproduct mix the system of workers and machines is capable of producing as an integrated whole.System capacity is less than design capacity or at the most equal, because of the limitation ofproduct mix, quality specification, breakdowns. The actual is even less because of many factorsaffecting the output such as actual demand, downtime due to machine/equipment failure,unauthorised absenteeism. Fig. 5.6 Capacity and output relationship PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  ! The system capacity is less than design capacity because of long range uncontrollablefactors. The actual output is still reduced because of short-term effects such as, breakdown ofequipment, inefficiency of labour. The system efficiency is expressed as ratio of actual measuredoutput to the system capacity. Actual output System Efficiency (SE) = System capacity 3. Licensed capacity: Capacity licensed by the various regulatory agencies or governmentauthorities. This is the limitation on the output exercised by the government. 4. Installed capacity: The capacity provided at the time of installation of the plant is calledinstalled capacity. 5. Rated capacity: Capacity based on the highest production rate established by actual trialsis referred to as rated capacity.5.10.2 Process of Capacity PlanningCapacity planning is concerned with defining the long-term and the short-term capacity needs ofan organization and determining how those needs will be satisfied. Capacity planning decisionsare taken based upon the consumer demand and this is merged with the human, material andfinancial resources of the organization. Capacity requirements can be evaluated from two perspectives—long-term capacity strategiesand short-term capacity strategies.1. LONG-TERM CAPACITY STRATEGIESLong-term capacity requirements are more difficult to determine because the future demand andtechnology are uncertain. Forecasting for five or ten years into the future is more risky anddifficult. Even sometimes company’s today’s products may not be existing in the future. Longrange capacity requirements are dependent on marketing plans, product development and life-cycle of the product. Long-term capacity planning is concerned with accommodating majorchanges that affect overall level of the output in long-term. Marketing environmental assessmentand implementing the long-term capacity plans in a systematic manner are the major responsibilitiesof management. Following parameters will affect long range capacity decisions. 1. Multiple products: Company’s produce more than one product using the same facilitiesin order to increase the profit. The manufacturing of multiple products will reduce the risk offailure. Having more than one product helps the capacity planners to do a better job. Becauseproducts are in different stages of their life-cycles, it is easy to schedule them to get maximumcapacity utilisation. 2. Phasing in capacity: In high technology industries, and in industries where technologydevelopments are very fast, the rate of obsolescence is high. The products should be brought intothe market quickly. The time to construct the facilities will be long and there is no much time asthe products should be introduced into the market quickly. Here the solution is phase in capacityon modular basis. Some commitment is made for building funds and men towards facilities over aperiod of 3–5 years. This is an effective way of capitalising on technological breakthrough. 3. Phasing out capacity: The outdated manufacturing facilities cause excessive plant &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTclosures and down time. The impact of closures is not limited to only fixed costs of plant andmachinery. Thus, the phasing out here is done with humanistic way without affecting the community.The phasing out options makes alternative arrangements for men like shifting them to other jobsor to other locations, compensating the employees, etc.2. SHORT-TERM CAPACITY STRATEGIESManagers often use forecasts of product demand to estimate the short-term workload the facilitymust handle. Managers looking ahead up to 12 months, anticipate output requirements for differentproducts, and services. Managers then compare requirements with existing capacity and thentake decisions as to when the capacity adjustments are needed. For short-term periods of up to one year, fundamental capacity is fixed. Major facilities willnot be changed. Many short-term adjustments for increasing or decreasing capacity are possible.The adjustments to be required depend upon the conversion process like whether it is capitalintensive or labour intensive or whether product can be stored as inventory. Capital intensive processes depend on physical facilities, plant and equipment. Short-termcapacity can be modified by operating these facilities more or less intensively than normal. Inlabour intensive processes short-term capacity can be changed by laying off or hiring people orby giving overtime to workers. The strategies for changing capacity also depend upon how longthe product can be stored as inventory. The short-term capacity strategies are: 1. Inventories: Stock of finished goods during slack periods to meet the demand duringpeak period. 2. Backlog: During peak periods, the willing customers are requested to wait and theirorders are fulfilled after a peak demand period. 3. Employment level (hiring or firing): Hire additional employees during peak demandperiod and layoff employees as demand decreases. 4. Employee training: Develop multi-skilled employees through training so that they canbe rotated among different jobs. The multi-skilling helps as an alternative to hiring employees. 5. Subcontracting: During peak periods, hire the capacity of other firms temporarily tomake the component parts or products. 6. Process design: Change job contents by redesigning the job. 5.11 ROUTINGRouting may be defined as the selection of path which each part of the product will follow whilebeing transformed from raw materials to finished products. Path of the product will also givesequence of operation to be adopted while being manufactured. In other way, routing means determination of most advantageous path to be followed fromdepartment to department and machine to machine till raw material gets its final shape, whichinvolves the following steps: (a) Type of work to be done on product or its parts. (b) Operation required to do the work. (c) Sequence of operation required. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  # (d) Where the work will be done. (e) A proper classification about the personnel required and the machine for doing the work. For effective production control of a well-managed industry with standard conditions, therouting plays an important role, i.e., to have the best results obtained from available plantcapacity. Thus routing provides the basis for scheduling, dispatching and follow-up.5.11.1 Techniques of RoutingWhile converting raw material into required goods different operations are to be performed andthe selection of a particular path of operations for each piece is termed as ‘Routing’. Thisselection of a particular path, i.e. sequence of operations must be the best and cheapest to havethe lowest cost of the final product. The various routing techniques are: 1. Route card: This card always accompanies with the job throughout all operations. Thisindicates the material used during manufacturing and their progress from one operation toanother. In addition to this the details of scrap and good work produced are also recorded. 2. Work sheet: It contains (a) Specifications to be followed while manufacturing. (b) Instructions regarding routing of every part with identification number of machines and work place of operation. This sheet is made for manufacturing as well as for maintenance. 3. Route sheet: It deals with specific production order. Generally made from operationsheets. One sheet is required for each part or component of the order. These includes the following: (a) Number and other identification of order. (b) Symbol and identification of part. (c) Number of pieces to be made. (d) Number of pieces in each lot—if put through in lots. (e) Operation data which includes: (i) List of operation on the part. (ii) Department in which operations are to be performed. (iii) Machine to be used for each operation. (iv) Fixed sequence of operation, if any. (f) Rate at which job must be completed, determined from the operation sheet. 4. Move order: Though this is document needed for production control, it is never usedfor routing system. Move order is prepared for each operation as per operation sheet. On thisthe quantity passed forward, scrapped and to be rectified are recorded. It is returnedto planning office when the operation is completed. 5.12 SCHEDULINGScheduling can be defined as “prescribing of when and where each operation necessary tomanufacture the product is to be performed.” It is also defined as “establishing of times at which to begin and complete each event or $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENToperation comprising a procedure”. The principle aim of scheduling is to plan the sequence ofwork so that production can be systematically arranged towards the end of completion of allproducts by due date.5.12.1 Principles of Scheduling 1. The principle of optimum task size: Scheduling tends to achieve maximum efficiencywhen the task sizes are small, and all tasks of same order of magnitude. 2. Principle of optimum production plan: The planning should be such that it imposes anequal load on all plants. 3. Principle of optimum sequence: Scheduling tends to achieve the maximum efficiencywhen the work is planned so that work hours are normally used in the same sequence.5.12.2 Inputs to Scheduling 1. Performance standards: The information regarding the performance standards (standard times for operations) helps to know the capacity in order to assign required machine hours to the facility. 2. Units in which loading and scheduling is to be expressed. 3. Effective capacity of the work centre. 4. Demand pattern and extent of flexibility to be provided for rush orders. 5. Overlapping of operations. 6. Individual job schedules.5.12.3 Scheduling StrategiesScheduling strategies vary widely among firms and range from ‘no scheduling’ to very sophisticatedapproaches. These strategies are grouped into four classes: 1. Detailed scheduling: Detailed scheduling for specific jobs that are arrived from customersis impracticable in actual manufacturing situation. Changes in orders, equipment breakdown, andunforeseen events deviate the plans. 2. Cumulative scheduling: Cumulative scheduling of total work load is useful especiallyfor long range planning of capacity needs. This may load the current period excessively and underload future periods. It has some means to control the jobs. 3. Cumulative detailed: Cumulative detailed combination is both feasible and practicalapproach. If master schedule has fixed and flexible portions. 4. Priority decision rules: Priority decision rules are scheduling guides that are usedindependently and in conjunction with one of the above strategies, i.e., first come first serve.These are useful in reducing Work-In-Process (WIP) inventory. PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  %5.12.4 Types of SchedulingTypes of scheduling can be categorized as forward scheduling and backward scheduling. 1. Forward scheduling is commonly used in job shops where customers place their orderson “needed as soon as possible” basis. Forward scheduling determines start and finish times ofnext priority job by assigning it the earliest available time slot and from that time, determineswhen the job will be finished in that work centre. Since the job and its components start as earlyas possible, they will typically be completed before they are due at the subsequent work centresin the routing. The forward method generates in the process inventory that are needed atsubsequent work centres and higher inventory cost. Forward scheduling is simple to use and itgets jobs done in shorter lead times, compared to backward scheduling. 2. Backward scheduling is often used in assembly type industries and commit in advanceto specific delivery dates. Backward scheduling determines the start and finish times for waitingjobs by assigning them to the latest available time slot that will enable each job to be completedjust when it is due, but done before. By assigning jobs as late as possible, backward schedulingminimizes inventories since a job is not completed until it must go directly to the next work centreon its routing. Forward and backward scheduling methods are shown in Fig. 5.7. Fig. 5.7 Forward and backward scheduling 5.13 SCHEDULING METHODOLOGYThe scheduling methodology depends upon the type of industry, organization, product, and levelof sophistication required. They are: 1. Charts and boards, &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 2. Priority decision rules, and 3. Mathematical programming methods.1. Gantt Charts and BoardsGantt charts and associated scheduling boards have been extensively used scheduling devices inthe past, although many of the charts are now drawn by computer. Gantt charts are extremelyeasy to understand and can quickly reveal the current or planned situation to all concerned. Theyare used in several forms, namely, (a) Scheduling or progress charts, which depicts the sequential schedule; (b) Load charts, which show the work assigned to a group of workers or machines; and (c) Record a chart, which are used to record the actual operating times and delays of workers and machines.2. Priority Decision RulesPriority decision rules are simplified guidelines for determining the sequence in which jobs willbe done. In some firms these rules take the place of priority planning systems such as MRPsystems. Following are some of the priority rules followed. date Symbol Priority rule FCFS First come, first served EDO Earliest due date LS Least slack (that is, time due less processing time) SPT Shortest processing time LPT Longest processing time PCO Preferred customer order RS Random selection3. Mathematical Programming MethodsScheduling is a complex resource allocation problem. Firms process capacity, labour skills, materialsand they seek to allocate their use so as to maximize a profit or service objective, or perhapsmeet a demand while minimizing costs. The following are some of the models used in scheduling and production control. (a) Linear programming model: Here all the constraints and objective functions areformulated as a linear equation and then problem is solved for optimality. Simplex method,transportation methods and assignment method are major methods used here. (b) PERT/CPM network model: PERT/CPM network is the network showing the sequenceof operations for a project and the precedence relation between the activities to be completed. Note: Scheduling is done in all the activities of an organisation i.e., production, maintenance etc. Therefore,all the methods and techniques of scheduling is used for maintenance management (Ref. Chapter 8). PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL  EXERCISESSection A 1. What do you mean by production planning and control? 2. What do you mean by aggregate planning? 3.

The packaged product weighs about 75 kg.ESCOM was not the innovator of the system. Rather, its managers sat back and let RCA andothers develop the market, and ESCOM is currently producing under license agreements. ESCOMhas a conscious strategy of being a follower with new product innovations. It does not have thefinancial resources to be a leader in research and development. ESCOM’s present opportunity is indicated by the fact that industry sales of VHS recordershave increased 30 per cent per year for the past two years, and forecasts for the next year andthe two following are even more enticing. ESCOM has established a 10 per cent market shareposition and feels that it can at least maintain this position if it has the needed capacity; it couldpossibly improve its market share if competitors fail to provide capacity at the time it is needed.

ESCOM regards the first yearforecast as being quite solid, based on its present market share and a compilation of severalindustry forecasts from different sources. It is less sure about the forecasts for future years, butit is basing these forecasts on patterns for both black and white and color TV sales during theirproduct life cycles. ESCOM’s VHS model has a factory price of Rs 600. Variable costs are 70 percent of theprice. Inventory carrying costs are 20 per cent of inventory value, 15 percentage points of whichrepresents the cost of capital. ESCOM’s facility planners estimate that a 40,000 unit plant canbe built for Rs. 5 million and a 200,00 unit plant, for Rs. 10 million. Land and labour are availablein the area, and either size plant can be built within a year. (a) What capacity plans do you think ESCOM should make for next year? Why?

To achieve this, there are severalapproaches. Profit may be maximized by cutting costs for the same selling price per unit. If itis a monopolistic business, without giving much of importance to the cost reduction programs, theprice may be fixed suitably to earn sufficient profit. But, to survive in a competitive businessenvironment, goods and services produced by a firm should have the minimum required quality.Extra quality means extra cost. So, the level of quality should be decided in relation to otherfactors such that the product is well absorbed in the market. In all these cases, to have repeatedsales and thereby increased sales revenue, basic quality is considered to be one of the supportivefactors. Quality is a measure of how closely a good or service conforms to specified standard. Quality standards may be any one or a combination of attributes and variables of the productbeing manufactured. The attributes will include performance, reliability, appearance, commitmentto delivery time, etc., variables may be some measurement variables like, length, width, height,diameter, surface finish, etc. 131 ! PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Most of the above characteristics are related to products. Similarly, some of the qualitycharacteristics of services are meeting promised due dates, safety, comfort, security, less waitingtime and so forth. So, the various dimensions of quality are performance, features, reliability,conformance, durability, serviceability, aesthetics, perceived quality, safety, comfort, security,commitment to due dates, less waiting time, etc. 6.2 QUALITYDifferent meaning could be attached to the word quality under different circumstances. The wordquality does not mean the quality of manufactured product only. It may refer to the quality ofthe process (i.e., men, material, and machines) and even that of management. Where the qualitymanufactured product referred as or defined as “Quality of product as the degree in which itfulfills the requirement of the customer. It is not absolute but it judged or realized by comparingit with some standards”. Quality begins with the design of a product in accordance with the customer specificationfurther it involved the established measurement standards, the use of proper material, selectionof suitable manufacturing process etc., quality is a relative term and it is generally used withreference to the end use of the product. Crosby defined as “Quality is conformance to requirement or specifications”. Juran defined as “Quality is fitness for use”. “The Quality of a product or service is thefitness of that product or service for meeting or exceeding its intended use as required by thecustomer.”6.2.1 Fundamental Factors Affecting QualityThe nine fundamental factors (9 M’s), which are affecting the quality of products and services,are: markets, money, management, men, motivation, materials, machines and mechanization.Modern information methods and mounting product requirements. 1. Market: Because of technology advancement, we could see many new products tosatisfy customer wants. At the same time, the customer wants are also changing dynamically.So, it is the role of companies to identify needs and then meet it with existing technologies orby developing new technologies. 2. Money: The increased global competition necessitates huge outlays for new equipmentsand process. This should be rewarded by improved productivity. This is possible by minimizingquality costs associated with the maintenance and improvements of quality level. 3. Management: Because of the increased complex structure of business organization, thequality related responsibilities lie with persons at different levels in the organization. 4. Men: The rapid growth in technical knowledge leads to development of human resourcewith different specialization. This necessitates some groups like, system engineering group tointegrate the idea of full specialization. QUALITY CONTROL !! 5. Motivation: If we fix the responsibility of achieving quality with each individual in theorganization with proper motivation techniques, there will not be any problem in producing thedesigned quality products. 6. Materials: Selection of proper materials to meet the desired tolerance limit is also animportant consideration. Quality attributes like, surface finish, strength, diameter etc., can beobtained by proper selection of material. 7. Machines and mechanization: In order to have quality products which will lead tohigher productivity of any organization, we need to use advanced machines and mechanizevarious operations. 8. Modern information methods: The modern information methods help in storing andretrieving needed data for manufacturing, marketing and servicing. 9. Mounting product requirements: Product diversification to meet customers taste leadsto intricacy in design, manufacturing and quality standards. Hence, companies should plan adequatesystem to tackle all these requirements. 6.3 CONTROLThe process through which the standards are established and met with standards is called control.This process consists of observing our activity performance, comparing the performance withsome standard and then taking action if the observed performance is significantly too differentfrom the standards. The control process involves a universal sequence of steps as follows: 1. Choose the control object 2. Choose a unit of measure 3. Set the standard value 4. Choose a sensing device which can measure 5. Measure actual performance 6. Interpret the difference between actual and standard 7. Taking action.6.3.1 Need for Controlling QualityIn the absence of quality, the following will result: 1. No yardstick for comparing the quality of goods/services. 2. Difficulty in maintaining consistency in quality. 3. Dissatisfied customers due to increased maintenance and operating costs of products/services. 4. Increased rework cost while manufacturing products/providing services. 5. Reduced life time of the products/services. 6. Reduced flexibility with respect to usage of standard spare parts. 7. Hence, controlling quality is an essential activity. !&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 6.4 INSPECTIONInspection is an important tool to achieve quality concept. It is necessary to assure confidenceto manufacturer and aims satisfaction to customer. Inspection is an indispensable tool of modernmanufacturing process. It helps to control quality, reduces manufacturing costs, eliminate scraplosses and assignable causes of defective work. The inspection and test unit is responsible for appraising the quality of incoming raw materialsand components as well as the quality of the manufactured product or service. It checks thecomponents at various stages with reference to certain predetermined factors and detecting andsorting out the faulty or defective items. It also specified the types of inspection devices to useand the procedures to follow to measure the quality characteristics. Inspection only measures the degree of conformance to a standard in the case of variables.In the case of attributes inspection merely separates the nonconforming from the conforming.Inspection does not show why the nonconforming units are being produced. Inspection is the most common method of attaining standardization, uniformity and quality ofworkmanship. It is the cost art of controlling the production quality after comparison with theestablished standards and specifications. It is the function of quality control. If the said item doesnot fall within the zone of acceptability it will be rejected and corrective measure will be appliedto see that the items in future conform to specified standards.6.4.1 Objectives of Inspection 1. To detect and remove the faulty raw materials before it undergoes production. 2. To detect the faulty products in production whenever it is detected. 3. To bring facts to the notice of managers before they become serous to enable them discover weaknesses and over the problem. 4. To prevent the substandard reaching the customer and reducing complaints. 5. To promote reputation for quality and reliability of product.6.4.2 Purpose of Inspection 1. To distinguish good lots from bad lots. 2. To distinguish good pieces from bad pieces. 3. To determine if the process is changing. 4. To determine if the process is approaching the specification limits. 5. To rate quality of product. 6. To rate accuracy of inspectors. 7. To measure the precision of the measuring instrument. 8. To secure products-design information. 9. To measure process capability. QUALITY CONTROL !#6.4.3 Types of Inspection Types of inspection are: 1. Floor inspection 2. Centralized inspection 3. Combined inspection 4. Functional inspection 5. First piece inspection 6. Pilot piece inspection 7. Final inspection1. FLOOR INSPECTIONIn this system, the inspection is performed at the place of production. It suggests the checking ofmaterials in process at the machine or in the production time by patrolling inspectors. Theseinspectors move from machine to machine and from one to the other work centres. Inspectors haveto be highly skilled. This method of inspection minimize the material handling, does not disrupt theline layout of machinery and quickly locate the defect and readily offers field and correction.Advantages 1. Detection of errors of the source reduces scrap and rework. 2. Correction is done before it affects further production, resulting in saving cost of unnecessary work on defective parts. 3. Material handling time is reduced. 4. Job satisfaction to worker as he can’t be held responsible for bad work at a later date. 5. Greater number of pieces can be checked than a sample size. 6. Does not delay in production.Disadvantages 1. Delicate instruments can be employed. 2. Measuring or inspection equipment have to be recalibrated often as they are subjected to wear or dust. 3. High cost of inspection because of numerous sets of inspections and skilled inspectors. 4. Supervision of inspectors is difficult due to vibration. 5. Pressure on inspector. 6. Possibility of biased inspection because of worker.Suitability 1. Heavy products are produced. 2. Different work centres are integrated in continuous line layout.2. CENTRALISED INSPECTIONInspection is carried in a central place with all testing equipment, sensitive equipment is housedin air-conditioned area. Samples are brought to the inspection floor for checking. Centralisedinspection may locate in one or more places in the manufacturing industry. !$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTAdvantages 1. Greater degree of inspection due to sensitive equipment. 2. Less number of inspectors and tools. 3. Equipment needs less frequency of recalibration. 4. Cost of inspection is reduced. 5. Unbiased inspection. 6. Supervision of inspectors made possible. 7. No distraction to the inspector.Disadvantages 1. Defects of job are not revealed quickly for prevention. 2. Greater material handling. 3. High cost as products are subjected to production before they are prevented. 4. Greater delay in production. 5. Inspection of heavy work not possible. 6. Production control work is more complicated. 7. Greater scrap.3. COMBINED INSPECTIONCombination of two methods whatever may be the method of inspection, whether floor or central.The main objective is to locate and prevent defect which may not repeat itself in subsequentoperation to see whether any corrective measure is required and finally to maintain qualityeconomically.4. FUNCTIONAL INSPECTIONThis system only checks for the main function, the product is expected to perform. Thus anelectrical motor can be checked for the specified speed and load characteristics. It does notreveal the variation of individual parts but can assure combined satisfactory performance of allparts put together. Both manufacturers and purchasers can do this, if large number of articlesare needed at regular intervals. This is also called assembly inspection.5. FIRST PIECE OR FIRST-OFF INSPECTIONSFirst piece of the shift or lot is inspected. This is particularly used where automatic machines areemployed. Any discrepancy from the operator as machine tool can be checked to see that theproduct is within in control limits. Excepting for need for precautions for tool we are check anddisturbance in machine set up, this yields good result if the operator is careful.6. PILOT PIECE INSPECTIONThis is done immediately after new design or product is developed. Manufacturer of product is doneeither on regular shop floor if production is not disturbed. If production is affected to a large extent,the product is manufactured in a pilot plant. This is suitable for mass production and products involvinglarge number of components such as automobiles aeroplanes etc., and modification are design ormanufacturing process is done until satisfactory performance is assured or established. QUALITY CONTROL !%7. FINAL INSPECTIONThis is also similar to functional or assembly inspection. This inspection is done only after completionof work. This is widely employed in process industries where there is not possible such as,electroplating or anodizing products. This is done in conjunction with incoming material inspection.6.4.4 Methods of InspectionThere are two methods of inspection. They are: 100% inspection and sampling inspection.1. 100% INSPECTIONThis type will involve careful inspection in detail of quality at each strategic point or stage ofmanufacture where the test is involved is non-destructive and every piece is separately inspected.It requires more number of inspectors and hence it is a costly method. There is no sampling error.This is subjected to inspection error arising out of fatigue, negligence, difficulty of supervision etc.Hence, completer accuracy of influence is seldom attained. It is suitable only when a smallnumber of pieces are there or a very high degree of quality is required. Example: Jet engines,aircraft, medical and scientific equipment.2. SAMPLING INSPECTIONIn this method randomly selected samples are inspected. Samples taken from different patchesof products are representatives. If the sample proves defective, the entire concerned is to berejected or recovered. Sampling inspection is cheaper and quicker. It requires less number ofInspectors. It is subjected to sampling errors but the magnitude of sampling error can be estimated.In the case of destructive test, random or sampling inspection is desirable. This type of inspectiongoverns wide currency due to the introduction of automatic machines or equipments which areless susceptible to chance variable and hence require less inspection, suitable for inspection ofproducts which have less precision importance and are less costly. Example: Electrical bulbs,radio bulbs, washing machine etc.6.4.5 Drawbacks of InspectionFollowing are the disadvantages of inspection: 1. Inspection adds to the cost of the product but not for its value. 2. It is partially subjective, often the inspector has to judge whether a products passes or not. 3. Fatigue and Monotony may affect any inspection judgment. 4. Inspection merely separates good and bad items. It is no way to prevent the production of bad items. 6.5 QUALITY CONTROLQuality Control (QC) may be defined as a system that is used to maintain a desired level ofquality in a product or service. It is a systematic control of various factors that affect the qualityof the product. It depends on materials, tools, machines, type of labour, working conditions etc. !&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTQC is a broad term, it involves inspection at particular stage but mere inspection does not meanQC. As opposed to inspection, in quality control activity emphasis is placed on the quality futureproduction. Quality control aims at prevention of defects at the source, relies on effectivefeedback system and corrective action procedure. Quality control uses inspection as a valuable tool. According to Juran “Quality control is the regulatory process through which we measureactual quality performance, compare it with standards, and act on the difference”. Anotherdefinition of quality control is from ANSI/ASQC standard (1978) quality control is defined as“The operational techniques and the activities which sustain a quality of product or service thatwill satisfy given needs; also the use of such techniques and activities”. Alford and Beatty define QC as “In the broad sense, quality control is the mechanism bywhich products are made to measure up to specifications determined from customers, demandsand transformed into sales engineering and manufacturing requirements, it is concerned withmaking things right rather than discovering and rejecting those made wrong”.6.5.1 Types of Quality ControlQC is not a function of any single department or a person. It is the primary responsibility of anysupervisor to turn out work of acceptable quality. Quality control can be divided into three mainsub-areas, those are: 1. Off-line quality control, 2. Statistical process control, and 3. Acceptance sampling plans. 1. Off-line quality control: Its procedure deal with measures to select and choosecontrollable product and process parameters in such a way that the deviation between theproduct or process output and the standard will be minimized. Much of this task is accomplishedthrough product and process design. Example: Taguchi method, principles of experimental design etc. 2. Statistical process control: SPC involves comparing the output of a process or aservice with a standard and taking remedial actions in case of a discrepancy between the two.It also involves determining whether a process can produce a product that meets desiredspecification or requirements. On-line SPC means that information is gathered about the product,process, or service while it is functional. The corrective action is taken in that operational phase.This is real-time basis. 3. Acceptance sampling plans: A plan that determines the number of items to sample andthe acceptance criteria of the lot, based on meeting certain stipulated conditions (such as the riskof rejecting a good lot or accepting a bad lot) is known as an acceptance sampling plan.6.5.2 Steps in Quality ControlFollowing are the steps in quality control process: 1. Formulate quality policy. 2. Set the standards or specifications on the basis of customer’s preference, cost and profit. 3. Select inspection plan and set up procedure for checking. 4. Detect deviations from set standards of specifications. 5. Take corrective actions or necessary changes to achieve standards. QUALITY CONTROL ! 6. Decide on salvage method i.e., to decide how the defective parts are disposed of, entire scrap or rework. 7. Coordination of quality problems. 8. Developing quality consciousness both within and outside the organization. 9. Developing procedures for good vendor-vendee relations.6.5.3 Objectives of Quality ControlFollowing are the objectives of quality control: 1. To improve the companies income by making the production more acceptable to the customers, i.e., by providing long life, greater usefulness, maintainability etc. 2. To reduce companies cost through reduction of losses due to defects. 3. To achieve interchangeability of manufacture in large scale production. 4. To produce optimal quality at reduced price. 5. To ensure satisfaction of customers with productions or services or high quality level, to build customer goodwill, confidence and reputation of manufacturer. 6. To make inspection prompt to ensure quality control. 7. To check the variation during manufacturing. The broad areas of application of quality control are incoming material control, processcontrol and product control.6.5.4 Benefits of Quality Control l Improving the quality of products and services. l Increasing the productivity of manufacturing processes, commercial business, corporations. l Reducing manufacturing and corporate costs. l Determining and improving the marketability of products and services. l Reducing consumer prices of products and services. l Improving and/or assuring on time deliveries and availability. l Assisting in the management of an enterprise.6.5.5 Seven Tools for Quality ControlTo make rational decisions using data obtained on the product, or process, or from the consumer,organizations use certain graphical tools. These methods help us learn about the characteristicsof a process, its operating state of affairs and the kind of output we may expect from it. Graphicalmethods are easy to understand and provide comprehensive information; they are a viable toolfor the analysis of product and process data. These tools are effect on quality improvement. Theseven quality control tools are: 1. Pareto charts 2. Check sheets 3. Cause and effect diagram 4. Scatter diagrams 5. Histogram 6. Graphs or flow charts 7. Control charts &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT1. PARETO CHARTSPareto charts help prioritize by arranging them in decreasing order of importantce. In an environmentof limited resources these diagrams help companies to decide on the order in which they shouldaddress problems. The Pareto analysis can be used to identify the problem in a number of forms. (a) Analysis of losses by material (number or past number). (b) Analysis of losses by process i.e., classification of defects or lot rejections in terms of the process. (c) Analysis of losses by product family. (d) Analysis by supplier across the entire spectrum of purchases. (e) Analysis by cost of the parts. (f) Analysis by failure mode. Example: The Fig. 6.1 shows a Pareto chart of reasons for poor quality. Poor design willbe the major reason, as indicated by 64%. Thus, this is the problem that the manufacturing unitshould address first. A — Poor Design B — Defective Parts C — Operator Error D — Wrong Dimensions E — Surface Abrasion F — Machine Calibrations G — Defective Material2. CHECK SHEETSCheck sheets facilitate systematic record keeping or data collection observations are recorded asthey happen which reveals patterns or trends. Data collection through the use of a checklist isoften the first step in analysis of quality problem. A checklist is a form used to record thefrequency of occurrence of certain product or service characteristics related to quality. Thecharacteristics may be measurable on a continuous scale such as weight, diameter, time or length. Fig. 6.1 Pareto chart QUALITY CONTROL&quot;Example: The table is a check sheet for an organization’s computer related problems. Fig. 6.2 Checklist3. CAUSE AND EFFECT DIAGRAMIt is sometimes called as Fish-bone diagram. It is first developed by Kaorv Ishikawa in 1943 andis sometimes called as Ishikawa diagram. The diameter helps the management trace customercomplaints directly to the operations involved. The main quality problem is referred to Fish-head;the major categories of potential cause structural bones and the likely specific causes to ribs. Itexplores possible causes of problems, with the intention being to discover the root causes. Thisdiagram helps identify possible reasons for a process to go out of control as well as possibleeffects on the process. Fig. 6.3 Fishbone diagram4. SCATTER DIAGRAM (SCATTER PLOTS)It often indicates the relationship between two variables. They are often used as follow-ups toa cause and effect analysis to determine whether a stated cause truly does impact the qualitycharacteristics. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT . Fig. 6.4 Scatter diagram Example: The above figure plots advertising expenditure against company sales and indicatesa strong positive relationship between the two variables. As the level of advertising expenditureincreases sales tend to increase.5. HISTOGRAM (OR) BAR CHARTSIt displays the large amounts of data that are difficult to interpret in their raw form. A histogramsummarizes data measured on a continuous scale showing the frequency distribution of somequality characteristics (in statistical terms the central tendency and the dispersion of the data). Fig. 6.5 HistogramOften the mean of the data is indicated on the histogram. A bar chart is a series of barerepresenting the frequency of occurrence of data characteristics, the bar height indicates thenumber of times a particular quality characteristic was observed.6. FLOW CHARTS (OR) GRAPHSIt shows the sequence of events in a process. They are used for manufacturing and service operations.Flow charts are often used to diagram operational procedures to simplify the system. They can identifybottlenecks, redundant steps and non-value added activities. A realistic flow chart can be constructedby using the knowledge of the person who are directly involved in the particular process. The flowchart can be identifies where delays can occur. Fig. 6.6 Flowchart QUALITY CONTROL&quot;!7. CONTROL CHARTSIt distinguish special causes of variations from common causes of variation. They are used tomonitor and control process on an ongoing basis. A typical control chart plots a selected qualitycharacteristic found from sub-group of observations as a function of sample number. Characteristicssuch as sample average, sample range and sample proportion of non-conforming units are plotted.The centre line on a control chart represents the average value of characteristics being plotted.Two limits know as the upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) are also shownon control charts. These limits are constructed so that if the process is operating under a stablesystem of chance causes, the problem of an observation falling outside these limits is quite small.Figure 6.7 shows a generalized representation of a control chart. Control chart shows the performance of a process from two points of view. First, they showa snapshot of the process at the moment the data are collected. Second, they show the processtrend as time progresses. Process trends are important because they help in identifying the out-of-control status if it actually exists. Also, they help to detect variations outside the normaloperational limits, and to identify the cause of variations. Fig. 6.7 shows a generalised representationof a control chart. Fig. 6.7 Control charts6.5.6 Causes of Variation in QualityThe variation in the quality of product in any manufacturing process is broadly classified as: (a) Chance causes (b) Assignable causes.(A) CHANCE CAUSESThe chance causes are those causes which are inherit in manufacturing process by virtue ofoperational and constructional features of the equipments involved in a manufacturing process. This is because of— 1. Machine vibrations 2. Voltage variations 3. Composition variation of material, etc. &quot;&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT They are difficult to trace and difficult to control, even under best condition of production.Even though, it is possible to trace out, it is not economical to eliminate. The chance causesresults in only a minute amount of variation in process. Variation in chance causes is due tointernal factors only the general pattern of variation under chance causes will follow a stablestatistical distribution (normal distribution). Variation within the control limits means only randomcauses are present.(B) ASSIGNABLE CAUSESThese are the causes which creates ordinary variation in the production quality. Assignable cause’s variation can always be traced to a specific quality. They occur due to— 1. Lack of skill in operation 2. Wrong maintenance practice 3. New vendors 4. Error in setting jigs and fixtures 5. Raw material defects Variation due to these causes can be controlled before the defective items are produced.Any one assignable cause can result in a large amount of variation in process. If the assignablecauses are present, the system will not follow a stable statistical distribution. When the actualvariation exceeds the control limits, it is a signal that assignable causes extend the process andprocess should be investigated. 6.6 STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROLStatistical process control (SPC) is the application of statistical techniques to determine whetherthe output of a process conforms to the product or service design. It aims at achieving goodquality during manufacture or service through prevention rather than detection. It is concernedwith controlling the process that makes the product because if the process is good then theproduct will automatically be good.6.6.1 Control ChartsSPC is implemented through control charts that are used to monitor the output of the process andindicate the presence of problems requiring further action. Control charts can be used to monitorprocesses where output is measured as either variables or attributes. There are two types ofcontrol charts: Variable control chart and attribute control chart. 1. Variable control charts: It is one by which it is possible to measures the qualitycharacteristics of a product. The variable control charts are X-BAR chart, R-BAR chart,SIGMA chart. 2. Attribute control chart: It is one in which it is not possible to measures the qualitycharacteristics of a product, i.e., it is based on visual inspection only like good or bad, successor failure, accepted or rejected. The attribute control charts are p-charts, np-charts, c-charts,u-charts. It requires only a count of observations on characteristics e.g., the number of non-conforming items in a sample. QUALITY CONTROL&quot;# Fig. 6.8 Control chartsCHARACTERISTICS OF CONTROL CHARTSA control chart is a time-ordered diagram to monitor a quality characteristic, consisting of: 1. A nominal value, or centre line, the average of several past samples. 2. Two control limits used to judge whether action is required, an upper control limit (UCL) and a lower control limit (LCL). 3. Data points, each consisting of the average measurement calculated from a sample taken from the process, ordered overtime. By the Central Limit Theorem, regardless of the distribution of the underlying individual measurements, the distribution of the sample means will follow a normal distribution. The control limits are set based on the sampling distribution of the quality measurement.BENEFITS OF USING CONTROL CHARTSFollowing are the benefits of control charts: 1. A control chart indicates when something may be wrong, so that corrective action can be taken. 2. The patterns of the plot on a control chart diagnosis possible cause and hence indicate possible remedial actions. 3. It can estimate the process capability of process. 4. It provides useful information regarding actions to take for quality improvement.OBJECTIVES OF CONTROL CHARTSFollowing are the objectives of control charts: 1. To secure information to be used in establishing or changing specifications or in determining whether the process can meet specifications or not. 2. To secure information to be used on establishing or changing production procedures. 3. To secure information to be used on establishing or changing inspection procedures or acceptance procedures or both. 4. To provide a basis for current decision during production. &quot;$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 5. To provide a basis for current decisions on acceptance for rejection of manufacturing or purchased product. 6. To familiarize personnel with the use of control chart.CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLESAs the name indicates, these charts will use variable data of a process. X chart given an ideaof the central tendency of the observations. These charts will reveal the variations betweensample observations. R chart gives an idea about the spread (dispersion) of the observations. Thischart shows the variations within the samples. X-Chart and R-Chart: The formulas used to establish various control limits are as follows:(a) Standard Deviation of the Process, σ, Unknown R-Chart: To calculate the range of the data, subtract the smallest from the largest measurementin the sample. The control limits are: UCLR = D4 R and LCLR = D3 Rwhere R = average of several past R values and is the central line of the control chart, and D3, D4 = constants that provide three standard deviation (three-sigma) limits for a given sample size X -Chart: The control limits are: UCL X = X + A 2 R and LCL X = X − A 2 Rwhere X = central line of the chart and the average of past sample mean’s, and A 2 = constant to provide three-sigma limits for the process mean.(b) Standard Deviation of the Process, σ , Known Control charts for variables (with the standard deviation of the process, σ, known) monitorthe mean, X , of the process distribution. The control limits are: UCL = X + 2σ Xand LCL = X − 2σ Xwhere X = centre line of the chart and the average of several past sample means, Z is the standard normal deviate (number of standard deviations from the average), σ X = σ / n and is the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, and n is the sample size Procedures to construct X-chart and R-chart 1. Identify the process to be controlled. QUALITY CONTROL&quot;% 2. Select the variable of interest. 3. Decide a suitable sample size (n) and number of samples to be collected (k). 4. Collect the specified number of samples over a given time interval. 5. Find the measurement of interest for each piece within the sample. 6. Obtain mean (X) of each sample. 7. Establish control limits for X and R-charts.CONTROL CHARTS FOR ATTRIBUTESP-charts and C-charts are charts will used for attributes. This chart shows the quality characteristicsrather than measurements.P-CHART A p-chart is a commonly used control chart for attributes, whereby the quality characteristicis counted, rather than measured, and the entire item or service can be declared good ordefective. The standard deviation of the proportion defective, p, is:&gt;C σp = p 1 − p / n , where n = sample size, and p = average of several past p values andcentral line on the chart. Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which is the actual distributionof p, UCLp = p + Zσ pand LCLp = p − Zσ pwhere z is the normal deviate (number of standard deviations from the average).

LCL = 0.1167 – 0.05566 = 0.06114 = 0.0611 (Approx.) Conclusion: All the samples are within the control limit and we can say process is undercontrol.TYPES OF SAMPLING ERRORSThere are two types of errors. They are type-I and type-II that can occur when makinginferences from control chart.Type-I: Error or α-error or Level of SignificanceReject the hypothesis when it is true. This results from inferring that a process is out of control when it is actually in control. Theprobability of type-I error is denoted by α, suppose a process is in control. If a point on thecontrol chart falls outside the control limits, we assume that, the process is out of control.However, since the control limits are a finite distance (3σ) from the mean. There is a smallchance about 0.0026 of a sample falling outside the control limits. In such instances, inferring theprocess is out of control is wrong conclusion. The control limits could be placed sufficiently far apart say 4 or 5σ stand deviations on eachside of the central lines to reduce the probability of type-I error.Type-II: Error or β-errorAccept the hypothesis when it is false. This results from inferring that a process is in control when it is really out of control. If noobservations for outside the control limits we conclude that the process is in control while inreality it is out control. For example, the process mean has changed. # PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The process could out of control because process variability has changed (due to presenceof new operator). As the control limits are placed further apart the probability of type-II errorincreases. To reduce the probability of type-II error it tends to have the control limits placedcloser to each other. This increases the probability of type-I error. Thus, the two types of errorsare inversely related to each other as the control limits change. Increasing the sample size canreduce both α and β.6.6.2 Acceptance SamplingThe objective of acceptance sampling is to take decision whether to accept or reject a lot basedon sample’s characteristics. The lot may be incoming raw materials or finished parts. An accurate method to check the quality of lots is to do 100% inspection. But, 100%inspection will have the following limitations: l The cost of inspection is high. l Destructive methods of testing will result in 100% spoilage of the parts. l Time taken for inspection will be too long. l When the population is large or infinite, it would be impossible or impracticable to inspect each unit. Hence, acceptance-sampling procedure has lot of scope in practical application. Acceptancesampling can be used for attributes as well as variables. Acceptance sampling deals with accept or reject situation of the incoming raw materials andfinished goods. Let the size of the incoming lot be N and the size of the sample drawn be n.The probability of getting a given number of defective goods parts out a sample consisting of npieces will follow binomial distribution. If the lot size is infinite or very large, such that when asample is drawn from it and not replaced, then the usage of binomial distribution is justified.Otherwise, we will have to use hyper-geometric distribution. Specifications of a single sampling plan will contain a sample size (n) and an acceptancenumber C. As an example, if we assume the sample size as 50 and the acceptance number as3, the interpretation of the plan is explained as follows: Select a sample of size 50 from a lot andobtain the number of defective pieces in the sample. If the number of defective pieces is lessthan or equal to 3, then accept the whole lot from which the sample is drawn. Otherwise, rejectthe whole lot. This is called single sampling plan. There are several variations of this plan. In this process, one will commit two types of errors, viz., type-I error and type-II error. Ifthe lot is really good, but based on the sample information, it is rejected, then the supplier/producer will be penalized. This is called producer’s risk or type-I error. The notation for thiserror is α. On the other hand, if the lot is really bad, but it is accepted based on the sampleinformation, then the customer will be at loss. This is called consumer’s risk or type-II error. Thenotation for this error is β. So, both parties should jointly decide about the levels of producer’srisk (α) and consumer’s risk (β) based on mutual agreement.OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (O.C. CURVE)The concepts of the two types of risk are well explained using an operating characteristic curve.This curve will provide a basis for selecting alternate sample plans. For a given value of samplesize (n), acceptance number (C), the O.C. curve is shown in Fig. 6.8. QUALITY CONTROL #! In Fig. 6.9, per cent defective is shown on x-axis. The probability of accepting the lot forgiven per cent defective is shown on y-axis. The value for per cent defective indicates thequality level of the lot inspected. AQL means acceptable quality level and LTPD indicates lottolerance per cent defectives. These represent quality levels of the lot submitted for inspection.If the quality level of the lot inspected is at AQL or less than AQL, then the customers aresatisfied with the quality of the lot. The corresponding probability of acceptance is called1 – α. On the other hand, if the quality level is more than or equal to LTPD, the quality ofthe lot is considered to be inferior from consumer’s viewpoint. The corresponding probabilityof acceptance of the lot is called β. The quality levelling between AQL and LTPD is calledindifferent zone. Fig. 6.9 Operating characteristic curve So, we require α, β, AQL and LTPD to design a sample plan. Based on these, one candetermine n and C for the implementation purpose of the plan. Fig. 6.10 shows a various O.C. curves for different combinations of n and C. Fig. 6.10 Operation characteristic curve for different samples. #&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTSINGLE SAMPLING PLANThe design of single sampling plan with a specified producer’s risk and consumer’s risk isdemonstrated in this section. The required data for designing such plan are as follows: (a) Producer’s Risk (α) (b) Consumer’s Risk (b) (c) Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) (d) Lot Tolerance Per cent Defectives (LPTD) The objective of this design is to find out the values for the sample size (n) and acceptancenumber (C). The values for n and C are to be selected such that the O.C. curve passes throughthe following two coordinates: l Coordinate with respect to the given α and AQL. l Coordinate with respect to the given β and LTPD. But, the values of n and C should be integers. So, it will be very difficult to find n and Cexactly for the given parameters of the design. Hence, we will have to look for approximateinteger values for n and C such that the O.C. curve more or less passes through the above twocoordinates. 6.7 QUALITY CIRCLESThe quality circles begun in Japan in 1960s. The concept of quality circles is based on theparticipating style of management. It assumes that productivity will improve through an uplift ofmorale and motivations which are in turn achieved through consultation and discussion in informalgroups. One organizational mechanism for worker participation in quality is the quality circle. Itis typically an informal group of people that consists of operators, supervisors, managers and soon who get together to improve ways to make the product or deliver the service. According to Juran, quality circle defined as “a group of work force level people, usuallyfrom within one department, who volunteer to meet weekly (on company time) to address qualityproblems that occur within their department.” Quality circle members select the problems and are given training is problem-solvingtechniques. A quality circle can be an effective productivity improvement tool because itgenerates new ideas and implements them. Where the introduction of quality circle iscapably planned and where the company environment is supporting they are highlysuccessful. The benefits fall into two categories: those are measurable saving and improvement in theattitudes and behaviour of people. Quality circles pursue two types of problems, those concernedwith the personal well being of the worker and those concerned with the well being of company.6.7.1 Benefits of QCThe most important benefit of quality circles is their effect on people’s attitudes fall into threecategories: QUALITY CONTROL ##1. Quality Circles Effect on Individual Characteristics (a) Quality circles enable the individual to improve personal capabilities—group participation and learning specific problem-solving tools. (b) Quality circles increase the individual’s self-respect. (c) Quality circles help worker change certain personality characteristics—shy person become as active.2. Quality Circles Effect on Individuals Relations with Other (a) Quality circles increase the respect of the supervisor for the worker. (b) Quality circles increase workers understanding of the difficulties faced by supervisors— problem selection, solving and implementations. (c) Quality circle increase management’s respect for worker.3. Quality Circles Effect on Workers and Their Attributes (a) Quality circles change some workers negative attitudes. (b) Quality circle reduces conflict stemming from the working environment. (c) Quality circles help workers to understand better the reasons while many problems solved quickly. Quality circles, as a management tool, are based on the following basic principles ofpeople: (a) People want to do a good job. (b) People want to be recognized as intelligent, interested employees and to participate in decisions affecting their work. (c) People want information to better understand goals and problems of their organization and make informed decisions. (d) Employees want recognition and responsibility and a feeling of self-esteem. Motivational methods are not enough for successful quality circle programs. Managementsupport, technical knowledge, and statistical procedures are essential. 6.8 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENTNow-a-days, customers demand products/services with greater durability and reliability at themost economic price. This forces producers to strictly follow quality procedures right from designtill shipment and installation of the products. So that goal of any competitive industry is to providea product or service at the most economical costs, ensuring full customer satisfaction. This canbe achieved through Total Quality Management (TQM), because, quality is not a technicalfunction, but a systemic process extending throughout all phases of the business, e.g., marketing,design, development, engineering, purchasing, production/operations. As per Feigebaum, “Total Quality Management is an effective system of integrating thequality development, quality maintenance and quality improvement efforts of various groups in anorganization so as to enable marketing, engineering, production and service at the most economicallevels which allow for full customer satisfaction”. #$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT6.8.1 Benefits of TQMThe benefits of TQM can be classified into the following two categories: 1. Customer satisfaction oriented benefits. 2. Economic improvements oriented benefits. 1. Customer satisfaction oriented benefits: The benefits under this category are listed below: (a) Improvement in product quality. (b) Improvement in product design. (c) Improvement in production flow. (d) Improvement in employee morale and quality consciousness. (e) Improvement of product service. (f) Improvement in market place acceptance. 2. Economic improvements oriented benefits: The benefits under this category are asfollows: (a) Reductions in operating costs. (b) Reductions in operating losses. (c) Reductions in field service costs. (d) Reductions in liability exposure. 6.9 ISO 9000 SERIESISO stands for International Organization for Standardization. It is an international body, whichconsists of representatives from more than 90 countries. The national standard bodies of thesecountries are the members of this organization. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) are the Indianrepresentative to ISO, ISO and International Electro Technical Commission (IEC)) operate jointlyas a single system. These are non-governmental organizations, which exist to provide commonstandards on international trade of goods and services. ISO 9000 standards expect firms to have a quality manual that meets ISO guidelines,documents, quality procedures and job instructions, and verification of compliance by third-partyauditors. ISO 9000 series has five international standards on quality managements. They are: 1. ISO 9000 — Quality management and Quality assurance standards 2. ISO 9001 — Quality systems: Quality in design 3. ISO 9002 — Quality systems: Production and Installation 4. ISO 9003 — Quality systems: Final inspection and test 5. ISO 9004 — Quality management and systems6.9.1 Objectives of ISO 9000 SeriesThe objectives of ISO 9000 series is listed in Table 6.1. QUALITY CONTROL #% TABLE 6.1: ISO 9000 series Standard Objectives/Tasks ISO 9000 This provides guidelines on selection and use of quality management and quality assurance standards. ISO 9001 It has 20 elements covering design, development, production, installation and servicing. ISO 9002 It has 18 elements covering production and installation. It is same as ISO 9001 without the first two tasks, viz., design and development. This is applicable for the units excluding R&amp;D functions. ISO 9003 It has 12 elements covering final inspection and testing for laboratories and warehouses etc. ISO 9004 This provides guidelines to interpret the quality management and quality assurance. This also has suggestions which are not mandatory.6.9.2 Benefits of ISO 9000 SeriesISO 9000 series provides several tangible and intangible benefits which are listed below: 1. This gives competitive advantage in the global market. 2. Consistency in quality, since ISO helps in detecting non-conformity early which makes it possible to take corrective action. 3. Documentation of quality procedures adds clarity to quality system. 4. ISO 9000 ensures adequate and regular quality training for all members of the organization. 5. ISO helps the customers to have cost effective purchase procedure. 6. The customers while making purchases from companies with ISO certificate need not spend much on inspection and testing. This will reduce the quality cost and lead-time. 7. This will help in increasing productivity. 8. This will aid to improved morale and involvement of workers. 9. The level of job satisfaction would be more.6.9.3 Steps in ISO 9000 Registration 1. Selection of appropriate standard from ISO 9001, ISO 9002 and ISO 9003 using the guidelines given in ISO 9000. 2. Preparation of quality manual to cover all the elements in the selected model. 3. Preparation of procedures and shop floor instructions which are used at the time of implementing the system. Also document these items. 4. Self-auditing to check compliance of the selected model. 5. Selection of a registrar and making application to obtain certificate for the selected model. A registrar is an independent body with knowledge and experience to evaluate any one ofthe three models of the company’s quality system (ISO 9002). Registrars are approved andcertified by acridities. #&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The registrar, on successful verification and assessment will register the company. Beforeselecting a registrar, one should know the following: 1. Accreditors of the registrar. 2. Background and credibility of the registrar. 3. Cost of registration through the proposed registrar. 4. Expected harmony between the company and the potential registrar while working towards implementing ISO model in the company. 6.10 APPLICATION ISO 9000: ISO 14000 SERIESOVERVIEWThe ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards are intended to assist organizationsmanage the environmental effect of their business practices. The ISO 14000 series is similar tothe ISO 9000 series published in 1987. The purpose of the ISO 9000 series is to encourageorganizations to institute quality assurance management programs. Although ISO 9000 deals withthe overall management of an organization and ISO 14000 deals with the management of theenvironmental effects of an organization, both standards are concerned with processes, and thereis talk of combining the two series into one. Both series of standards were published by ISO, the International Organization forStandardization. The purpose of ISO is to facilitate international trade and cooperation in commercial,intellectual, scientific and economic endeavors by developing international standards. ISO originallyfocused on industrial and mechanical engineering standards. Now, it has ventured into settingstandards for an organization’s processes, policies, and practices. The environmental standards of ISO 14000 deal with how a company manages theenvironment inside its facilities and the immediate outside environment. However, the standardsalso call for analysis of the entire life cycle of a product, from raw material to eventualdisposal. These standards do not mandate a particular level of pollution or performance, butfocus on awareness of the processes and procedures that can effect the environment. It shouldbe noted that adherence to the ISO 14000 standards does not in anyway release a companyfrom any national or local regulations regarding specific performance issues regarding theenvironment. Some of the standards in the ISO 14000 series are: l ISO 14001—Specification of Environmental Management Systems l ISO 14004—Guideline Standard l ISO 14010 through ISO 14015—Environmental Auditing and Related Activities l ISO 14020 through ISO 14024—Environmental Labelling l ISO 14031 through ISO 14032—Environmental Performance Evaluation l ISO 14040 through ISO 14043—Life Cycle Assessment l ISO 14050—Terms and Definitions QUALITY CONTROL # Although the ISO 14000 standards are similar to the ISO 9000 standards, the nature of theenvironmental standards creates a need for people who are technical environment professionalsin addition to those required to maintain the documentation necessary for certification.6.10.1 The Benefits of ISO 14000 CertificationThe benefits of acquiring ISO certification go beyond the satisfaction of doing a good deed.Adhering to the standard may result in better conformance to environmental regulations, greatermarketability, better use of resources, higher quality goods and services, increased levels ofsafety, improved image and increased profits. l The environmental awareness and the documentation that are required by the ISO 14000 standards assist a company in conforming to environmental regulations. This means that a company, by diligently adhering to the standard, is less likely to violate environmental regulations and is always ready for inspection by a regulatory agency. In addition, the certification and documentation may aid a company in acquiring capital, in defending itself during environmental litigation and in receiving insurance or permits. l A wider market for a company’s goods and services may result from certification. Many corporations and governments will be looking for suppliers that are ISO 14000 certified in order to maintain their own certification and environment-friendly image. l Producers of consumer goods may find that many consumers not only try to purchase goods from environment-friendly companies, but will spend a little more if they feel they are helping the environment. In order to reap this benefit, a company must make their environmental efforts known through advertising and labelling. l The process analyses that go along with ISO 14000 certification may result in streamlining processes and more efficient use of resources and raw materials and subsequently reduce a company’s costs. l Reducing the amount of potentially dangerous substances in an end product may result in less use of dangerous chemicals in a plant. This leads to a safer internal environment for employees and the possibility of reduced insurance premiums. Improved employee morale may result when employees feel that the workplace is safer and they are contributing to the environmental effort.

Edwards Deming Dr.Deming, you said it will take about thirty years for the United States to catch up with Japan.This is a somewhat pessimistic view of the United States. Would you elaborate on this point? I don’t really know how long it will take. I think it will take thirty years; it should take allof thirty years. I don’t think America will catch up with Japan because, so far as I can see, theJapanese system has the advantage over the American system. For example, consider theprinciple of constancy of purpose, which is absolutely vital and is number one in my FourteenPoints. It refers to planning for the future with constancy of purpose. Now in America some companies certainly do have constancy of purpose, but most do not.Most have a president who was brought in to improve the quarterly dividend. That’s his job; youcan’t blame him for doing it. He’ll be there a while, and then go on to some other place to raise thequarterly dividend there. For instance, someone told me that there were five candidates forpresident of one of the biggest and most famous of America’s companies. When one of them wasselected, the other four resigned from the company. Such a thing could not happen in Japan. So yousee, the American system is so set up that it cannot use the talents of its people. That’s very serious. People cannot work for the company. They only get out their quota. You can’t blame aperson for doing the job that is cut out for him since he has to pay his rent and take care of hisfamily. You can’t blame him, but you can blame management for a situation in which peoplecannot work for the company. An employee cannot remain on the job to find out for sure whatthe job is. The foreman does not have time to help him. As a matter of fact, the foreman maydecide a particular person cannot do the job at all and perhaps should be let go. People reportequipment out of order and nothing happens. If someone reports equipment out of order morethan three or four times, that person is considered a troublemaker. If he tries to find out moreabout the job from the-foreman, he is considered a troublemaker. People find out that it isimpossible to do what is best for the company or do their best work for the company. They justhave to carryon as best they can, given the handicaps. In addition, people have to use materials that are not suited to the job, and this creates asense of desperation. There isn’t much they can do about it-if they report, or try to do something,they are labeled troublemakers. This situation does not exist in Japan. There, everyone is willingto help everyone else. Dr. Deming, as you’ve mentioned, one of the Fourteen Points emphasizes constancyof purpose. Personally, I learned a great deal from that. Could you elaborate a little moreon that point? A good way to assess a company’s constancy of purpose is to evaluate the source ofultimate authority in that company. To whom does the president of the company answer? Doesanybody own the company? Do the owners answer to the stockholders? The stockholders,thousands of them, who want dividends-to whom do they answer? Do they answer to their $$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTconsciences? Do they answer to a built-in institution? Do they answer to a constitution of thecompany? Is there a constitution for the company? Some companies have a constitution. In medical service, for example, you have someconstancy of purpose. Not all, but some nursing homes or other medical institutions are under thegovernance of a religious board, and they’re very exact about service. The head of the organizationanswers to constancy of purpose. There is a constitution with an aim of going beyond the makingof dividends. You have to pay to keep such institutions going, but their job is service. The reason whythe public school systems fail in America is because the schools don’t answer to anybody. Thereis no constitution. What is their aim? Is it to teach, or to produce? Is it to help youngsters thathave ability to develop that ability, or is it something else? I don’t know. The aim is not stated,so the schools are failing. We hear that American companies are now changing and adopting such things asquality control. Do you think American companies are heeding your message? Many companies are forming QC circles in America without understanding what they’redoing. QC circles cannot be effective in the absence of quality control, which means managementactively adopting my Fourteen Points. Many companies are forming QC circles becausemanagement wants a lazy way to avoid the job of improving quality and productivity. Thesecircles will make a worthwhile contribution if they are given a chance, but QC circles alone arenot quality control. Once it becomes obvious that management is working on the Fourteen Pointsand is trying to do something to make people more effective in their work, then the workers willbe creative. Can you imagine people in a QC circle being effective when half of them will be turned outon the streets when business slacks off? Can you imagine an effective QC circle when half oreven fewer of the people involved were rehired after being laid off during a slump? People haveto feel secure. That means, according to the word’s derivation, “without concern,” from the Latinse for “without” and cure meaning “care” or “concern.” Security means being able to speak, askeach other questions, and, help one another. There is nothing to hide and no one to please. Mostpeople who work are only trying to please somebody because otherwise they might not have ajob. The lack of constancy of purpose in America is very serious. For example, I received aletter from a man who asked what he could do that would have a lasting benefit for his company.The problem is, the man will probably be where he is for only two more years. At the end oftwo years, he will either be promoted or he will look for a job with another company. He askedwhat fire he could start that would continue to burn after he leaves his job, whether he ispromoted at the same company or goes elsewhere. It’s a very serious question. I don’t knowif there is an answer. There is another serious matter in this country: the supposition that quality control consistsof a bag of techniques. Quality control is more than just a set of techniques. But you cannot havequality control without physical techniques. One of my Fourteen Points is to remove fear withina company, to make people secure. I don’t know of any physical techniques to bring this about.But it is through physical techniques that I discovered the existence of fear. Fear is costing QUALITY CONTROL $%companies a great deal of money and causing a lot of waste in out-of-order machines andrework. Fear causes wasted human effort and wasted materials. It arises because people do notunderstand their jobs, and have no place to go for help. I don’t know of any statistical techniqueby which to establish constancy of purpose and eliminate fear. Statistical techniques are certainly necessary for purchasing and selling materials, sincewithout them you cannot measure or understand the quality of what you are buying. Americanindustry and American government, especially the military, are being rooked by the practice ofpurchasing from the lowest bidder. They are forcing everyone to conform to the lowest price.That is wrong because there is no such thing as price without a measure of quality. Purchasingdepartments are not prepared to measure quality; they only know arithmetic. They understandthat thirteen cents less per thousand pieces translates into so many thousands of dollars per year.But they don’t understand that the quality of these pieces may be so bad that it will cause a greatdeal of trouble. You already referred to American management’s lack of understanding of qualitycontrol for production processes. Could we go back to that? Most American managers ‘have no idea how deep the trouble is, and those who do haveno idea of what can be done. There is no way for them to learn what to do that I know of. In the United States, I have been intrigued by the notion of the trade-off betweenquality and price and the trade-off between productivity and quality. Here these are seenas different things, and yet your message, which you say the Japanese have accepted, isnot to treat quality and price, and productivity and quality, as trade-off. Why has this beenso difficult for Americans to understand? Americans simply have no idea of what quality is. Ask almost any plant manager in thiscountry and he’ll say it is a trade-off, that you have one or the other. He does not know thatyou can have both, and that once you have quality, then you can have productivity, lower costs,and a better market position. Here, people don’t know this, but they know it in Japan. In 1950in Japan, 1 was able to get top management together for conferences to explain what they hadto do. No such gathering has ever been held in America and I don’t know if anybody has anyway of organizing one. In Japan, Mr. Ishikawa of JUSE organized conferences with topmanagement in July 1950, again in August, then six months later, and so on. Top managementunderstood from the beginning what they must do, and that as they improved quality, productivitywould increase. They had some examples within six months, and more within a year. News ofthese examples spread throughout the country, and everyone learned about them because Japanesemanagement was careful to disseminate the information. The supposition of so many Americans that better quality means more gold plating orpolishing, more time spent to do better work, is just not true. Quality improvement meansimproving the process so it produces quality without rework, quickly and directly. In other words,quality means making it right the first time so you don’t have to rework it. By improving theprocess, you decrease wasted human effort, wasted machine time and materials, and you get abetter product. If you decrease rework by six percent, you increase the productivity of aproduction line by six percent; and increase its capacity by the same amount. Therefore, in manycases, increased capacity could be achieved in this country simply by reducing wasted human $&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTeffort, machine time, and materials. In this country, better use of existing machinery-not newmachinery or automation-is the answer. How do you respond to American management’s idea that mechanization and automationare cost-saving devices rather than quality-improvement devices? In Japan mechanizationand automation are seen as quality improvement, obviously with cost-saving benefits on theside. But in Japan they’re working toward mechanization, automation, and the use ofrobots as quality-improvement devices. New machinery and automation very often bring higher costs, not lower ones. They alsobring headaches and troubles, which a company is unprepared to handle. The result is that theydecrease production, increase costs, lower quality, and create problems the company never hadbefore. The best thing to do is learn to use what you have efficiently. Once you learn that, thenthere’s a possibility you may learn to use more sophisticated equipment. I’m afraid that time isa long way off for this country. In Japan, now that they’re using present equipment successfully and efficiently and cannotextract any more capacity, the only way to increase production is with new automated machinery,because there are no more people to employ. There are no employment agencies in Japan whereyou can find people to work in plants. In the United States, on the other hand, there are sevenmillion unemployed, maybe half of whom are actually able and willing to work, and are good workers. Back in the 1950s, you made a prophetic statement when you told the Japanese thatif they pursued this quality-first approach, Japan would dominate the world market andeveryone, including the United States, would demand protection from Japanese imports.Did you make that prediction because you were convinced that American industries werenot pursuing the proper course of action in this field? No, I saw, through the conferences with the top management in Japan, that Japan could doa better job with quality control than America had ever done. Americans had not done well withquality control because they thought of it as a bag of techniques. As a group, management inAmerica never knew anything about quality control. What you had in America, from the intensivestatistical courses I started at Stanford University, were brilliant fires and applications all over thecountry. But when a person changed jobs, the fire burned out and there was nobody in managementto keep it going. We held the first course at Stanford in July 1942, and seventeen people came. Two monthslater, Stanford University gave another course, and later other universities gave courses. I taughttwenty-three of them myself. By that time, they would be attended by fifty or sixty or seventypeople. The War Department also gave courses at defense suppliers’ factories. Quality controlbecame a big fire. As a matter of fact, courses were given to a total of ten thousand people fromeight hundred companies, but nothing happened. Brilliant applications burned, sputtered, fizzled, and died out. What people did was solveindividual problems; they did not create a structure at the management level to carry out theirobligations. There was not sufficient appreciation at the management level to spread the methodsto other parts of the company. The man who saw these things first was Dr. Holbrook working at Stanford. He knew thejob that management must carry out. He saw it first. We tried, but our efforts were feeble, and QUALITY CONTROL $the results were zero. We did not know how to do it. In our eight-day courses, we would askcompanies to send their top people, but top people did not come. Some came for one afternoon.You don’t learn this in one afternoon. So quality control died out in America. Let me put it this way: more and more, quality control in America became merely statisticalmethods-the more applications, the better. Instead of finding many problems, we need to find thebig problem. Where are the problems? Let’s find the big problems first. What methods will help?Maybe no methods will help. Let’s be careful-so many things that happen are just carelessness.We don’t need control charts for them. We just need some action from management to cut thatcarelessness. Wrong design? That’s management’s fault. Recall of automobiles? Management’sfault, not the workers’ fault. People started control charts everywhere. The Ford Company had charts all over theirassembly plants across the country, one chart on top of another. Quality control “experts” satand made more and more charts. One man told me his job was to count the number of pointsout of control every day. But what happened was nothing. Quality control drifted into so-calledquality control departments that made charts. They would look at the charts and perhaps tellsomebody if something was out of control. The only people who could do anything never sawthe charts and never learned anything. That included everybody. Top management never heardor learned anything; people on the production lines did not learn anything. That was totally wrong,because the first step is for management to take on my Fourteen Points, namely, to gain purpose.The Japanese had already accomplished this task. The Japanese were all ready to work ontraining. JUSE was ready. But in 1950, quality control had practically died out in America. WhenI went to Japan in 1950, I said to myself, “Why repeat in Japan the mistakes that were madein America? I must get hold of top management and explain to them what their job is, becauseunless they do their part, these wonderful engineers will accomplish nothing. They will makebusiness applications and then the fire will burn out.” It was at that time I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Ichiro Ishikawa, who, after threeconferences, sent telegrams to forty-five men in top management telling them to come and hearme. Well, I did a very poor job, but I explained what management must do, what quality controlis from a management standpoint. For example, I told them to improve incoming materials, whichmeans working with vendors as if they were members of your family, and teaching them. I toldthem they must learn statistical control of quality. It’s a big job. Incoming materials were wretched, deplorable, and nobody seemed to care. They justthought that industry consisted of taking what you got and doing the best you could. But Iexplained that that won’t do because now you must compete. The consumer you never thoughtof-to whom you must now export-is in America, Canada, and Europe. Improve agriculture, yes,but the better way-the quicker way, the most effective way-is to export quality. They thoughtit could not be done. They said they had never done it, that they had a bad reputation. I told them,you can do it-you have to do it, you must. You must learn statistical methods. These methodsof quality control must be a part of everybody’s job. At that time, consumer research was unknown in Japan, but the aim of making products wasto help somebody. I think they had never thought of the consumer as the most important end ofthe production line. I told them they must study the needs of the consumer. They must look ahead % PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTone year, three years, eight years, to be ahead in new services and new products. As theylearned, they must teach everyone else. Well, that was the natural Japanese way. I did not knowhow much, but I gave them that advice. How did you develop your own views, not only of statistical control methods, but alsoyour central message that quality determines productivity? By simple arithmetic, if you have material coming in that is difficult to use -and there wasplenty of it coming to Japan in 1950-you will produce a lot of wasted human effort, machine time,and materials. There will be a lot of rework, with people occupying time trying to overcome thedeficiencies of defective incoming material. So if you have better material coming in, you eliminatewaste; production, quality, and productivity go up; costs go down; and your market position is improved. Well I think that I have put some principles on paper that everybody knew but that, in asense, nobody knew. They had never been put down on paper. I stated those principles in Japanin the summer of 1950, some for the first time. They’re obvious, perhaps, as Newton’s laws ofmotion are obvious. But like Newton’s laws, they’re not obvious to everyone. Is there a company in the United States that has heeded your message? Are theresome isolated cases? The Nashua Corporation in Nashua, New Hampshire, under the direction of its former president,William E. Conway, was off to a good start. Mr. Conway himself was doing a great deal, not onlyfor his corporation, but for American industry. Almost every day, visiting teams of ten to fifteenpeople from other companies came to Mr. Conway’s offices and plants to hear about what he wasdoing. He was getting a very good start. The entire company was meant for quality. Why is he so different from other American managers? I don’t know. There are other good companies. Some of them have started lately and theyare pushing along one of the great problems is finding competent statistical consultants. Thereare very few that can give competent training. One company I work with must train fiftythousand people to discover problems how long do you think it will take the purchasing departmentto learn to take quality into consideration along with price? It will take five years or more, andat the end of five years a lot of people will be gone. They will have other jobs. It’s going to takea long time. There is no quick road.Discussion Questions (a) Dr. Deming seems to put more emphasis on corporate culture than on quality control methodology. What is necessary to change a corporate culture to be as quality conscious as Deming feels is necessary to compete in global markets? (b) What are the relationships between quality and productivity? (c) If automation continues to be installed in both Japanese and U.S. industry, will the quality problem be solved by technology? (d) What are the prospects for making the quality of U.S. manufactured products companies? How can such a goal be achieved, given the current Japanese lead?

It is crucial to the welfare of industrialfirm as well as for the economic progress of the country. High productivity refers to doing thework in a shortest possible time with least expenditure on inputs without sacrificing quality andwith minimum wastage of resources. Work-study forms the basis for work system design. The purpose of work design is to identifythe most effective means of achieving necessary functions. This work-study aims at improving theexisting and proposed ways of doing work and establishing standard times for work performance.Work-study is encompassed by two techniques, i.e., method study and work measurement. “Method study is the systematic recording and critical examination of existing andproposed ways of doing work, as a means of developing and applying easier and moreeffective methods and reducing costs.” “Work measurement is the application or techniques designed to establish the time fora qualified worker to carry out a specified job at a defined level or performance.” 171 % PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT There is a close link between method study and work measurement. Method study isconcerned with the reduction of the work content and establishing the one best way of doing thejob whereas work measurement is concerned with investigation and reduction of any ineffectivetime associated with the job and establishing time standards for an operation carried out as perthe standard method. 7.2 PRODUCTIVITYProductivity is the quantitative relation between what we produce and we use as a resource toproduce them, i.e., arithmetic ratio of amount produced (output) to the amount of resources(input). Productivity can be expressed as: Output Productivity = Input Productivity refers to the efficiency of the production system. It is the concept that guidesthe management of production system. It is an indicator to how well the factors of production(land, capital, labour and energy) are utilised. European Productivity Agency (EPA) has defined productivity as, “Productivity is an attitude of mind. It is the mentality of progress, of the constantimprovements of that which exists. It is the certainty of being able to do better today thanyesterday and continuously. It is the constant adaptation of economic and social life tochanging conditions. It is the continual effort to apply new techniques and methods. It is thefaith in progress.” A major problem with productivity is that it means many things to many people. Economistsdetermine it from Gross National Product (GNP), managers view it as cost cutting and speed up,engineers think of it in terms of more output per hour. But generally accepted meaning is that it isthe relationship between goods and services produced and the resources employed in their production.7.2.1 Factors Influencing ProductivityFactors influencing productivity can be classified broadly into two categories: (A) controllable (orinternal) factors and (B) un-controllable (or external) factors.(A) CONTROLLABLE (OR INTERNAL) FACTORS 1. Product factor: In terms of productivity means the extent to which the product meetsoutput requirements product is judged by its usefulness. The cost benefit factor of a product canbe enhanced by increasing the benefit at the same cost or by reducing cost for the same benefit. 2. Plant and equipment: These play a prominent role in enhancing the productivity. Theincreased availability of the plant through proper maintenance and reduction of idle time increasesthe productivity. Productivity can be increased by paying proper attention to utilisation, age,modernisation, cost, investments etc. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) %! Fig. 7.1 Factors influencing productivity 3. Technology: Innovative and latest technology improves productivity to a greater extent.Automation and information technology helps to achieve improvements in material handling,storage, communication system and quality control. The various aspects of technology factors tobe considered are: (i) Size and capacity of the plant, (ii) Timely supply and quality of inputs, (iii) Production planning and control, (iv) Repairs and maintenance, (v) Waste reduction, and (vi) Efficient material handling system. 4. Material and energy: Efforts to reduce materials and energy consumption brings aboutconsiderable improvement in productivity. 1. Selection of quality material and right material. 2. Control of wastage and scrap. 3. Effective stock control. 4. Development of sources of supply. 5. Optimum energy utilisation and energy savings. 5. Human factors: Productivity is basically dependent upon human competence and skill.Ability to work effectively is governed by various factors such as education, training, experienceaptitude etc., of the employees. Motivation of employees will influence productivity. 6. Work methods: Improving the ways in which the work is done (methods) improvesproductivity, work study and industrial engineering techniques and training are the areas whichimprove the work methods, which in term enhances the productivity. 7. Management style: This influence the organizational design, communication in organization,policy and procedures. A flexible and dynamic management style is a better approach to achievehigher productivity.(B) UN-CONTROLLABLE (OR EXTERNAL) FACTORS 1. Structural adjustments: Structural adjustments include both economic and social changes.Economic changes that influence significantly are: %&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT (a) Shift in employment from agriculture to manufacturing industry, (b) Import of technology, and (c) Industrial competitiveness. Social changes such as women’s participation in the labour force, education, cultural values,attitudes are some of the factors that play a significant role in the improvement of productivity. 2. Natural resources: Manpower, land and raw materials are vital to the productivityimprovement. 3. Government and infrastructure: Government policies and programmes are significantto productivity practices of government agencies, transport and communication power, fiscalpolicies (interest rates, taxes) influence productivity to the greater extent.7.2.2 Total Productivity Measure (TPM)It is based on all the inputs. The model can be applied to any manufacturing organization orservice company. Total tangible output Total productivity = Total trangible input Total tangible output = Value of finished goods produced + Value of partial units produced + Dividents from securities + Interest + Other income Total tangible input = Value of (human + material + capital + energy + other inputs) used. The word tangible here refers to measurable. The output of the firm as well as the inputs must be expressed in a common measurementunit. The best way is to express them in rupee value.7.2.3 Partial Productivity Measures (PPM)Depending upon the individual input partial productivity measures are expressed as: Total output Partial productivity = Individual input Total output 1. Labour productivity = Labour input Labour input is measured in terms of man-hours Total output 2. Capital productivity = Capital input Total output 3. Material productivity = Material input Total output 4. Energy productivity = Energy input WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) %# One of the major disadvantage of partial productivity measures is that there is an overemphasis on one input factor to the extent that other input are underestimated or even ignored.7.2.4 Productivity Improvement Techniques(A) TECHNOLOGY BASED 1. Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), andComputer Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CIMS): CAD refers to design of products,processes or systems with the help of computers. The impact of CAD on human productivity issignificant for the advantages of CAD are: (a) Speed of evaluation of alternative designs, (b) Minimisation of risk of functioning, and (c) Error reduction. CAM is very much useful to design and control the manufacturing. It helps to achieve theeffectiveness in production system by line balancing. (a) Production Planning and Control (b) Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP), Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP II) and Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) (c) Automated Inspection. 2. Computer integrated manufacturing: Computer integrated manufacturing is characterisedby automatic line balancing, machine loading (scheduling and sequencing), automatic inventorycontrol and inspection. 1. Robotics 2. Laser technology 3. Modern maintenance techniques 4. Energy technology 5. Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS)(B) EMPLOYEE BASED 1. Financial and non-financial incentives at individual and group level. 2. Employee promotion. 3. Job design, job enlargement, job enrichment and job rotation. %$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 4. Worker participation in decision-making 5. Quality Circles (QC), Small Group Activities (SGA) 6. Personal development.(C) MATERAL BASED 1. Material planning and control 2. Purchasing, logistics 3. Material storage and retrieval 4. Source selection and procurement of quality material 5. Waste elimination.(D) PROCESS BASED 1. Methods engineering and work simplification 2. Job design evaluation, job safety 3. Human factors engineering.(E) PRODUCT BASED 1. Value analysis and value enginering 2. Product diversification 3. Standardisation and simplification 4. Reliability engineering 5. Product mix and promotion.(F) TASK BASED 1. Management style 2. Communication in the organisation 3. Work culture 4. Motivation 5. Promotion group activity. ILLUSTRATION 1: A company produces 160 kg of plastic moulded parts of acceptablequality by consuming 200 kg of raw materials for a particular period. For the next period,the output is doubled (320 kg) by consuming 420 kg of raw material and for a thirdperiod, the output is increased to 400 kg by consuming 400 kg of raw materal.

And which lead systematically tothe investigation of all the factors which affect the efficiency and economy of the situation beingreviewed, in order to effect improvement.” Fig. 7.2 Framework of work study Work study is a means of enhancing the production efficiency (productivity) of the firm byelimination of waste and unnecessary operations. It is a technique to identify non-value addingoperations by investigation of all the factors affecting the job. It is the only accurate andsystematic procedure oriented technique to establish time standards. It is going to contribute tothe profit as the savings will start immediately and continue throughout the life of the product. Method study and work measurement is part of work study. Part of method study is motionstudy, work measurement is also called by the name ‘Time study’. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) %7.3.1 Advantages of Work StudyFollowing are the advantages of work study: 1. It helps to achieve the smooth production flow with minimum interruptions. 2. It helps to reduce the cost of the product by eliminating waste and unnecessary operations. 3. Better worker-management relations. 4. Meets the delivery commitment. 5. Reduction in rejections and scrap and higher utilisation of resources of the organization. 6. Helps to achieve better working conditions. 7. Better workplace layout. 8. Improves upon the existing process or methods and helps in standardisation and simplification. 9. Helps to establish the standard time for an operation or job which has got application in manpower planning, production planning. 7.4 METHOD STUDYMethod study enables the industrial engineer to subject each operation to systematic analysis.The main purpose of method study is to eliminate the unnecessary operations and to achieve thebest method of performing the operation. Method study is also called methods engineering or work design. Method engineeringis used to describe collection of analysis techniques which focus on improving the effectivenessof men and machines. According to British Standards Institution (BS 3138): “Method study is the systematicrecording and critical examination or existing and proposed ways or doing work as ameans or developing and applying easier and more effective methods and reducing cost.” Fundamentally method study involves the breakdown of an operation or procedure into itscomponent elements and their systematic analysis. In carrying out the method study, the rightattitude of mind is important. The method study man should have: 1. The desire and determination to produce results. 2. Ability to achieve results. 3. An understanding of the human factors involved. Method study scope lies in improving work methods through process and operation analysis,such as: 1. Manufacturing operations and their sequence. 2. Workmen. 3. Materials, tools and gauges. 4. Layout of physical facilities and work station design. 5. Movement of men and material handling. 6. Work environment. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT7.4.1 Objectives of Method StudyMethod study is essentially concerned with finding better ways of doing things. It adds valueand increases the efficiency by eliminating unnecessary operations, avoidable delays and otherforms of waste. The improvement in efficiency is achieved through: 1. Improved layout and design of workplace. 2. Improved and efficient work procedures. 3. Effective utilisation of men, machines and materials. 4. Improved design or specification of the final product. The objectives of method study techniques are: 1. Present and analyse true facts concerning the situation. 2. To examine those facts critically. 3. To develop the best answer possible under given circumstances based on critical examination of facts.7.4.2 Scope of Method StudyThe scope of method study is not restricted to only manufacturing industries. Method studytechniques can be applied effectively in service sector as well. It can be applied in offices,hospitals, banks and other service organizations. The areas to which method study can be applied successfully in manufacturing are: 1. To improve work methods and procedures. 2. To determine the best sequence of doing work. 3. To smoothen material flow with minimum of back tracking and to improve layout. 4. To improve the working conditions and hence to improve labour efficiency. 5. To reduce monotony in the work. 6. To improve plant utilisation and material utilisation. 7. Elimination of waste and unproductive operations. 8. To reduce the manufacturing costs through reducing cycle time of operations.7.4.3 Steps or Procedure Involved in Methods StudyThe basic approach to method study consists of the following eight steps. The detailed procedurefor conducting the method study is shown in Fig. 7.3.1. SELECT the work to be studied and define its boundaries.2. RECORD the relevant facts about the job by direct observation and collect such additional data as may be needed from appropriate sources.3. EXAMINE the way the job is being performed and challenge its purpose, place sequence and method of performance. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)&amp;Fig. 7.3. Method study procedure4. DEVELOP the most practical, economic and effective method, drawing on the contributions of those concerned. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT5. EVALUATE different alternatives to developing a new improved method comparing the cost-effectiveness of the selected new method with the current method with the current method of performance.6. DEFINE the new method, as a result, in a clear manner and present it to those concerned, i.e., management, supervisors and workers.7. INSTALL the new method as a standard practice and train the persons involved in applying it.8. MAINTAIN the new method and introduce control procedures to prevent a drifting back to the previous method of work. Note: Only the first two steps have been dealt in detail.7.4.4 Selection of the Job for Method StudyCost is the main criteria for selection of a job, process and department for methods analysis. Tocarry out the method study, a job is selected such that the proposed method achieves one or moreof the following results: (a) Improvement in quality with lesser scrap. (b) Increased production through better utilisation of resources. (c) Elimination of unnecessary operations and movements. (d) Improved layout leading to smooth flow of material and a balanced production line. (e) Improved working conditions.CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION OF METHOD STUDYThe job should be selected for the method study based upon the following considerations: 1. Economic aspect 2. Technical aspect, and 3. Human aspect.A. Economic AspectsThe method study involves cost and time. If sufficient returns are not attained, the whole exercisewill go waste. Thus, the money spent should be justified by the savings from it. The followingguidelines can be used for selecting a job: (a) Bottleneck operations which are holding up other production operations. (b) Operations involving excessive labour. (c) Operations producing lot of scrap or defectives. (d) Operations having poor utilisation of resources. (e) Backtracking of materials and excessive movement of materials.B. Technical AspectsThe method study man should be careful enough to select a job in which he has the technicalknowledge and expertise. A person selecting a job in his area of expertise is going to do fulljustice. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)&amp;! Other factors which favour selection in technical aspect are: 1. Job having in consistent quality. 2. Operations generating lot of scraps. 3. Frequent complaints from workers regarding the job.C. Human Considerations Method study means a change as it is going to affect the way in which the job is donepresently and is not fully accepted by workman and the union. Human considerations play a vitalrole in method study. These are some of the situations where human aspect should be given dueimportance: 1. Workers complaining about unnecessary and tiring work. 2. More frequency of accidents. 3. Inconsistent earning.7.4.5 Recording Techniques for Method Study The next step in basic procedure, after selecting the work to be studied is to record all factsrelating to the existing method. In order that the activities selected for investigation may bevisualised in their entirety and in order to improve them through subsequent critical examination,it is essential to have some means of placing on record all the necessary facts about the existingmethod. Records are very much useful to make before and after comparison to assess theeffectiveness of the proposed improved method. The recording techniques are designed to simplify and standardise the recording work. Forthis purpose charts and diagrams are used. Fig. 7.4 Recording techniques for method studyCHARTS USED IN METHODS STUDYThis is the most popular method of recording the facts. The activities comprising the jobs arerecorded using method study symbols. A great care is to be taken in preparing the charts so that &amp;&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTthe information it shows is easily understood and recognized. The following information shouldbe given in the chart. These charts are used to measure the movement of operator or work (i.e.,in motion study). (a) Adequate description of the activities. (b) Whether the charting is for present or proposed method. (c) Specific reference to when the activities will begin and end. (d) Time and distance scales used wherever necessary. (e) The date of charting and the name of the person who does charting.Types of ChartsIt can be broadly divided into (A) Macro motion charts and (B) Micro motion charts. Macro motion charts are used for macro motion study and micro motion charts are used formicro motion study. Macro motion study is one which can be measured through ‘stop watch’ and micro motionstudy is one which cannot be measured through stop watch.(A) MACRO MOTION CHARTSFollowing four charts are used under this type:1. Operation Process Chart It is also called outline process chart. An operation process chart gives the bird’s eye viewof the whole process by recording only the major activities and inspections involved in theprocess. Operation process chart uses only two symbols, i.e., operation and inspection. Operation,process chart is helpful to: (a) Visualise the complete sequence of the operations and inspections in the process. (b) Know where the operation selected for detailed study fits into the entire process. (c) In operation process chart, the graphic representation of the points at which materials are introduced into the process and what operations and inspections are carried on them are shown.2. Flow Process Chart Flow process chart gives the sequence of flow of work of a product or any part of it throughthe work centre or the department recording the events using appropriate symbols. It is theamplification of the operation process chart in which operations; inspection, storage, delay andtransportation are represented. However, process charts are of three types: (a) Material type—Which shows the events that occur to the materials. (b) Man type—Activities performed by the man. (c) Equipment type—How equipment is used. The flow process chart is useful: (a) to reduce the distance travelled by men (or materials). (b) to avoid waiting time and unnecessary delays. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)&amp;# (c) to reduce the cycle time by combining or eliminating operations. (d) to fix up the sequence of operations. (e) to relocate the inspection stages. Like operation process chart, flow process chart is constructed by placing symbols onebelow another as per the occurrence of the activities and are joined by a vertical line. A briefdescription of the activity is written on the right hand side of the activity symbol and time ordistance is given on the left hand side.3. Two Handed Process Chart A two handed (operator process chart) is the most detailed type of flow chart in which theactivities of the workers hands are recorded in relation to one another. The two handed processchart is normally confined to work carried out at a single workplace. This also gives synchronisedand graphical representation of the sequence of manual activities of the worker. The applicationof this charts are: l To visualise the complete sequence of activities in a repetitive task. l To study the work station layout.4. Multiple Activity Chart It is a chart where activities of more than subject (worker or equipment) are each recordedon a common time scale to show their inter-relationship. Multiple activity chart is made: l to study idle time of the man and machines, l to determine number of machines handled by one operator, and l to determine number of operators required in teamwork to perform the given job.Diagrams Used in Method StudyThe flow process chart shows the sequence and nature of movement but it does not clearly showthe path of movements. In the paths of movements, there are often undesirable features such ascongestion, back tracking and unnecessary long movements. To record these unnecessary features,representation of the working area in the form of flow diagrams, string diagrams can be made: 1. To study the different layout plans and thereby; select the most optimal layout. 2. To study traffic and frequency over different routes of the plant. 3. Identification of back tracking and obstacles during movements. Diagrams are of two types: 1. Flow diagram and 2. String diagram.1. FLOW DIAGRAMFlow diagram is a drawing, of the working area, showing the location of the various activitiesidentified by their numbered symbols and are associated with particular flow process chart eitherman type or machine type. The routes followed in transport are shown by joining the symbols in sequence by a linewhich represents as nearly as possible the path or movement of the subject concerned. Following are the procedures to make the flow diagram: &amp;$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 1. The layout of the workplace is drawn to scale. 2. Relative positions of the machine tools, work benches, storage, and inspection benches are marked on the scale. 3. Path followed by the subject under study is tracked by drawing lines. 4. Each movement is serially numbered and indicated by arrow for direction. 5. Different colours are used to denote different types of movements.2. STRING DIAGRAMThe string diagram is a scale layout drawing on which, length of a string is used to record theextent as well as the pattern of movement of a worker working within a limited area during acertain period of time. The primary function of a string diagram is to produce a record of aexisting set of conditions so that the job of seeing what is actually taking place is made as simpleas possible. One of the most valuable features of the string diagram is the actual distance travelledduring the period of study to be calculated by relating the length of the thread used to the scaleof drawing. Thus, it helps to make a very effective comparison between different layouts ormethods of doing job in terms of the travelling involved. The main advantages of string diagram compared to flow diagram is that respective movementsbetween work stations which are difficult to be traced on the flow diagram can be convenientlyshown on string diagram. Folloging are the procedures to draw string diagram: 1. A layout of the work place of factory is drawn to scale on the soft board. 2. Pins are fixed into boards to mark the locations of work stations, pins are also driven at the turning points of the routes. 3. A measured length of the thread is taken to trace the movements (path). 4. The distance covered by the object is obtained by measuring the remaining part of the thread and subtracting it from original length.Symbols Used in Method StudyGraphical method of recording was originated by Gilberth, in order to make the presentation ofthe facts clearly without any ambiguity and to enable to grasp them quickly and clearly. It isuseful to use symbols instead of written description.(A) METHOD STUDY SYMBOLS Ο OPERATION o INSPECTION → TRANSPORTATION D DELAY ∇ STORAGE WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)&amp;% Operation O An operation occurs when an object is intentionally changed in one or more of its characteristics (physical or chemical). This indicates the main steps in a process, method or procedure. An operation always takes the object one stage ahead towards completion. Examples of operation are: l Turning, drilling, milling, etc. l A chemical reaction. l Welding, brazing and riveting. l Lifting, loading, unloading. l Getting instructions from supervisor. l Taking dictation. Inspection o An inspection occurs when an object is examined and compared with standard for quality and quantity. The inspection examples are: l Visual observations for finish. l Count of quantity of incoming material. l Checking the dimensions. Transportation → A transport indicates the movement of workers, materials or equipment from one place to another. Example: Movement of materials from one work station to another. Workers travelling to bring tools. Delay D: Delay (Temporary Storage) A delay occurs when the immediate performance of the next planned thing does not take place. Example: Work waiting between consecutive operations. Workers waiting at tool cribs. Operators waiting for instructions from supervisor. Storage ∇ Storage occurs when the object is kept in an authorised custody and is protected against unauthorised removal. For example, materials kept in stores to be distributed to various work.

It is a set oftechniques intended to divide the human activities in a groups of movements or micro-motions WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)&amp;(called Therbligs) and the study of such movements helps to find for an operator one best patternof movements that consumes less time and requires less effort to accomplish the task. Therbligswere suggested by Frank O. Gilbreth, the founder of motion study. Micro-motion study wasmainly employed for the job analysis. Its other applications includes: 1. As an aid in studying the activities of two or more persons on a group work? 2. As an aid in studying the relationship of the activities of the operator and the machine as a means of timing operations. 3. As an aid in obtaining motion time data for time standards. 4. Acts as permanent record of the method and time of activities of the operator and the machine. TABLE 7.1 SIMO chart symbols Sl. No. Code Name Description Colour 1.

Gilbreth differentiated 17 fundamental hand or hand and eye motions. Each Therbligs PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENThas a specific colour, symbol and letter for recording purposes. The Therbligs are micro-motionstudy involves the following steps: 1. Filming the operation to be studied. 2. Analysis of the data from the film. The recording of the data through SIMO chart is done as micro motion chart.SIMO Chart Simultaneous motion cycle chart (SIMO chart) is a recording technique for micro-motionstudy. A SIMO chart is a chart based on the film analysis, used to record simultaneously on acommon time scale the Therbligs or a group of Therbligs performed by different parts of the bodyof one or more operators. It is the micro-motion form of the man type flow process chart. To prepare SIMO chart,an elaborate procedure and use of expensive equipment are required and this study is justifiedwhen the saving resulting from study will be very high. 7.5 MOTION STUDYMotion study is part of method study where analysis of the motion of an operator or work willbe studied by following the prescribed methods.7.5.1 Principles of Motion studyThere are a number of principles concerning the economy of movements which have beendeveloped as a result of experience and which forms the basis for the development of improvedmethods at the workplace. These are first used by Frank Gilbreth, the founder of motion studyand further rearranged and amplified by Barnes, Maynard and others. The principles are grouped into three headings: (a) Use of the human body. (b) Arrangement of workplace. (c) Design of tools and equipment.(A) USES OF HUMAN BODY When possible: 1. The two hands should begin and complete their movements at the same time. 2. The two hands should not be idle at the same time except during periods of rest. 3. Motions of the arms should be made simultaneously. 4. Hand and body motions should be made at the lowest classification at which it is possible to do the work satisfactorily. 5. Momentum should be employed to help the worker, but should be reduced to a minimum whenever it has to be overcome by muscular effort. 6. Continuous curved movements are to be preferred to straight line motions involving sudden and changes in directions. 7. ‘Ballistic’ (i.e., free swinging) movements are faster, easier and more accurate than restricted or controlled movements. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)  8. Rhythm is essential to the smooth and automatic performance of a repetitive operation. The work should be arranged to permit easy and natural rhythm wherever possible. 9. Work should be arranged so that eye movements are confined to a comfortable area, without the need for frequent changes of focus.(B) ARRANGEMENT OF THE WORKPLACE 1. Definite and fixed stations should be provided for all tools and materials to permit habit formation. 2. Tools and materials should be pre-positioned to reduce searching. 3. Gravity fed, bins and containers should be used to deliver the materials as close to the point of use as possible. 4. Tools, materials and controls should be located within a maximum working area and as near to the worker as possible. 5. Materials and tools should be arranged to permit the best sequence of motions. 6. ‘Drop deliveries’ or ejectors should be used wherever possible, so that the operative does not have to use his hands to dispose of finished parts. 7. Provision should be made for adequate lightning, and a chair of type and height to permit good posture should be provided. The height of the workplace and seat should be arranged to allow alternate standing and seating.(C) DESIGN OF TOOLS AND EQUIPMENTS 1. The colour of the workplace should contrast with that of work and thus reduce eye fatigue. 2. The hands should be relieved of all work of ‘holding’ the work piece where this can be done by a jig or fixture or foot operated device. 3. Two or more tools should be combined where possible. 4. Where each finger performs some specific movement, as in typewriting, the load should be distributed in accordance with the inherent capacities of the fingers. 5. Handles such as those used on screw drivers and cranks should be designed to permit maximum surface of the hand to come in contact with the handle. 6. Levers, cross bars and wheel bars should be in such position that operator can manipulate them with least body change and with greatest mechanical advantage.7.5.2 Recording Techniques of Motion StudyMost of the techniques mentioned in method study is used in the motion study. They are asfollows:1. Macro Motion Study (a) Flow process chart (b) Two handed process chart. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT2. Micro Motion Study SIMO chart. [Note: Explained earlier in this chapter.] 7.6 WORK MEASUREMENTWork measurement is also called by the name ‘time study’. Work measurement is absolutelyessential for both the planning and control of operations. Without measurement data, we cannotdetermine the capacity of facilities or it is not possible to quote delivery dates or costs. Weare not in a position to determine the rate of production and also labour utilisation and efficiency.It may not be possible to introduce incentive schemes and standard costs for budget control.7.6.1 Objectives of Work MeasurementThe use of work measurement as a basis for incentives is only a small part of its total application.The objectives of work measurement are to provide a sound basis for: 1. Comparing alternative methods. 2. Assessing the correct initial manning (manpower requirement planning). 3. Planning and control. 4. Realistic costing. 5. Financial incentive schemes. 6. Delivery date of goods. 7. Cost reduction and cost control. 8. Identifying substandard workers. 9. Training new employees.7.6.2 Techniques of Work MeasurementFor the purpose of work measurement, work can be regarded as: 1. Repetitive work: The type of work in which the main operation or group of operationsrepeat continuously during the time spent at the job. These apply to work cycles of extremelyshort duration. 2. Non-repetitive work: It includes some type of maintenance and construction work,where the work cycle itself is hardly ever repeated identically. Various techniques of work measurement are: 1. Time study (stop watch technique), 2. Synthesis, 3. Work sampling, 4. Predetermined motion and time study, 5. Analytical estimating. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) ! Time study and work sampling involve direct observation and the remaining are data basedand analytical in nature. 1. Time study: A work measurement technique for recording the times and rates ofworking for the elements of a specified job carried out under specified conditions and foranalysing the data so as to determine the time necessary for carrying out the job at the definedlevel of performance. In other words measuring the time through stop watch is called time study. 2. Synthetic data: A work measurement technique for building up the time for a job or pansof the job at a defined level of performance by totalling element times obtained previously fromtime studies on other jobs containing the elements concerned or from synthetic data. 3. Work sampling: A technique in which a large number of observations are made over aperiod of time of one or group of machines, processes or workers. Each observation records whatis happening at that instant and the percentage of observations recorded for a particular activity,or delay, is a measure of the percentage of time during which that activities delay occurs. 4. Predetermined motion time study (PMTS): A work measurement technique wherebytimes established for basic human motions (classified according to the nature of the motion andconditions under which it is made) are used to build up the time for a job at the defined level ofperformance. The most commonly used PMTS is known as Methods Time Measurement (MTM). 5. Analytical estimating: A work measurement technique, being a development of estimating,whereby the time required to carry out elements of a job at a defined level of performance isestimated partly from knowledge and practical experience of the elements concerned and partlyfrom synthetic data. The work measurement techniques and their applications are shown in Table 7.2. TABLE 7.2: Work measurement techniques and their application Techniques Applications Unit of measurement 1. Time study Short cycle repetitive jobs. Centiminute (0.01 min) Widely used for direct work. 2. Synthetic Data Short cycle repetitive jobs. Centi minutes 3. Working sampling Long cycle jobs/heterogeneous Minutes operations. 4. MTM Manual operations confined to TMU (1 TMU = 0.006 min) one work centre. 5. Analytical estimation Short cycle non-repetitive job. Minutes 7.7 TIME STUDYTime study is also called work measurement. It is essential for both planning and control ofoperations. According to British Standard Institute time study has been defined as “The application oftechniques designed to establish the time for a qualified worker to carry out a specifiedjob at a defined level of performance.” &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT7.7.1 Steps in Making Time StudyStop watch time is the basic technique for determining accurate time standards. They areeconomical for repetitive type of work. Steps in taking the time study are: 1. Select the work to be studied. 2. Obtain and record all the information available about the job, the operator and the working conditions likely to affect the time study work. 3. Breakdown the operation into elements. An element is a instinct part of a specified activity composed of one or more fundamental motions selected for convenience of observation and timing. 4. Measure the time by means of a stop watch taken by the operator to perform each element of the operation. Either continuous method or snap back method of timing could be used. 5. At the same time, assess the operators effective speed of work relative to the observer’s concept of ‘normal’ speed. This is called performance rating. 6. Adjust the observed time by rating factor to obtain normal time for each element Observed time × Rating Normal = 100 7. Add the suitable allowances to compensate for fatigue, personal needs, contingencies. etc. to give standard time for each element. 8. Compute allowed time for the entire job by adding elemental standard times considering frequency of occurrence of each element. 9. Make a detailed job description describing the method for which the standard time is established. 10. Test and review standards wherever necessary. The basic steps in time study are represented by a block diagram in Fig. 7.5.7.7.2 Computation of Standard TimeStandard time is the time allowed to an operator to carry out the specified task under specifiedconditions and defined level of performance. The various allowances are added to the normaltime as applicable to get the standard time as shown in Fig. 7.6. Standard time may be defined as the, amount of time required to complete a unit of work:(a) under existing working conditions, (b) using the specified method and machinery, (c) by anoperator, able to the work in a proper manner, and (d) at a standard pace. Thus basic constituents of standard time are: 1. Elemental (observed time). 2. Performance rating to compensate for difference in pace of working. 3. Relaxation allowance. 4. Interference and contingency allowance. 5. Policy allowance. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) # Fig. 7.5 Steps in time study Fig. 7.6 Components standard time $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT OT – Observed Time PRF – Performance Rating Factor NT – Normal Time PA – Process Allowances RPA – Rest and Personal Allowances SA – Special Allowances PoA – Policy AllowancesAllowancesThe normal time for an operation does not contain any allowances for the worker. It is impossibleto work throughout the day even though the most practicable, effective method has been developed.Even under the best working method situation, the job will still demand the expenditure of humaneffort and some allowance must therefore be made for recovery from fatigue and for relaxation.Allowances must also be made to enable the worker to attend to his personal needs. Theallowances are categorised as: (1) Relaxation allowance, (2) Interference allowance, and (3)Contingency allowance.1. RELAXATION ALLOWANCERelaxation allowances are calculated so as to allow the worker to recover from fatigue. Relaxationallowance is a addition to the basic time intended to provide the worker with the opportunity torecover from the physiological and psychological effects of carrying out specified work underspecified conditions and to allow attention to personal needs. The amount of allowance willdepend on nature of the job. Relaxation allowances are of two types: fixed allowances and variable allowances. Fixed allowances constitute: (a) Personal needs allowance: It is intended to compensate the operator for the time necessary to leave, the workplace to attend to personal needs like drinking water, smoking, washing hands. Women require longer personal allowance than men. A fair personal allowance is 5% for men, and 7% for women. (b) Allowances for basic fatigue: This allowance is given to compensate for energy expended during working. A common figure considered as allowance is 4% of the basic time.2. VARIABLE ALLOWANCEVariable allowance is allowed to an operator who is working under poor environmental conditionsthat cannot be improved, added stress and strain in performing the job. The variable fatigue allowance is added to the fixed allowance to an operator who isengaged on medium and heavy work and working under abnormal conditions. The amount ofvariable fatigue allowance varies from organization to organization.3. INTERFERENCE ALLOWANCEIt is an allowance of time included into the work content of the job to compensate the operatorfor the unavoidable loss of production due to simultaneous stoppage of two or more machinesbeing operated by him. This allowance is applicable for machine or process controlled jobs. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) % Interference allowance varies in proportion to number of machines assigned to the operator.The interference of the machine increases the work content.4. CONTINGENCY ALLOWANCEA contingency allowance is a small allowance of time which may be included in a standard timeto meet legitimate and expected items of work or delays. The precise measurement of which isuneconomical because of their infrequent or irregular occurrence. This allowance provides for small unavoidable delays as well as for occasional minor extrawork: Some of the examples calling for contingency allowance are: l Tool breakage involving removal of tool from the holder and all other activities to insert new tool into the tool holder. l Power failures of small duration. l Obtaining the necessary tools and gauges from central tool store. Contingency allowance should not exceed 5%.5. POLICY ALLOWANCEPolicy allowances are not the genuine part of the time study and should be used with utmost careand only in clearly defined circumstances. The usual reason for making the policy allowance is to line up standard times with requirementsof wage agreement between employers and trade unions. The policy allowance is an increment, other than bonus increment, applied to a standard time(or to some constituent part of it, e.g., work content) to provide a satisfactory level of earningsfor a specified level of performance under exceptional circumstances. Policy allowances aresometimes made as imperfect functioning of a division or part of a plant. ILLUSTRATION 1: Assuming that the total observed time for an operation ofassembling an electric switch is 1.00 min. If the rating is 120%, find normal time. If anallowance of 10% is allowed for the operation, determine the standard time. SOLUTION: Obsessed time (or) selected time = 1.00 min Rating = 120% Allowance = 10% Rating % As we know that, normal time = Observed time × 100 120 = 1.00 × = 1.20 min 100 10 Allowance @ 10% = 1.20 × = 0.12 min 100 ∴ Standard time = Normal time + Allowances = 1.20 + 0.12 = 1.32 min. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT ILLUSTRATION 2: An operator manufactures 50 jobs in 6 hours and 30 minutes.If this time includes the time for setting his machine. Calculate the operator’s efficiency.Standard time allowed for the job was: Setting time = 35 min Production time per piece = 8 min SOLUTION: As standard time = Set up time + Time per piece × No. of pieces produced ∴ Standard time for manufacturing 50 jobs = 35 + 8 × 50 = 435 min = 7 hours and 15 min. Standard time × 100 Efficiency of operator = Actual time 435 × 100 = = 111.5%. 390 ILLUSTRATION 3: Following datas were obtained by a work study. Man from astudy conducted by hours. (i) Maintenance time (a) Get out and put away tools = 12.0 min/day (b) Cleaning of machine = 5.0 min/day (c) Oiling of machine = 5.0 min/day (d) Replenish coolant supply = 3.0 min/day (ii) Interruption (a) Interruption by foreman = 5.0 min/day (b) Interruption by porter etc. = 4.0 min/day (iii) Delay time due to power failure etc. = 6.0 min/day (iv) Personal time = 20.0 min/day Calculate total allowances, total available cycle time productive hours, considering aworking day of 8 hours. SOLUTION: Total allowance (sometimes also known as station time) = Total maintenance time + Interruption time + Delay time + Personal time = (12.0 + 5 + 5 + 3.0) + (5.0 + 4.0) + 6.0 + 20.0 = 25.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 20.0 = 60.0 min per day ∴ Total available cycle time = Total work period – Total allowances = 480 – 60 = 420 min/day Time available Productive hours = Number of hours 420 = = 52.5 min. 8 WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY)  ILLUSTRATION 4: Find out the standard time using the following data: Average time for machine elements = 6 min Average time for manual elements = 4 min Performance rating = 110% Allowances = 10% SOLUTION: Normal time = Machinery time + Manual time × Rating = 6 + 4 × 1.1 = 6 + 4.4 = 10.4 min ∴ Standard time = Normal time + Allowances 10 = 10.4 + 10.4 × 100 = 10.4 (1 + 0.1) = 11.44 min.

TOYS AND JOB DESIGN AT THE HOVEY AND BEARD COMPANY The following is a situation that occurred in the Hovey and Beard Company, as reported byJ. V. Clark. This company manufactured a line of wooden toys. One part of the process involved spraypainting partially assembled toys, after which the toys were hung on moving hooks that carriedthem through a drying oven. The operation, staffed entirely by women, was plagued withabsenteeism, high turnover, and low morale. Each woman at her paint booth would take a toyfrom the tray beside her, position it in a fixture, and spray on the color according to the requiredpattern. She then would release the toy and hang it on the conveyor hook. The rate at whichthe hooks moved had been calculated so that each woman, once fully trained, would be able tohang a painted toy on each hook before it passed beyond her reach. The women who worked in the paint room were on a group incentive plan that tied theirearnings to the production of the entire group. Since the operation was new, they received alearning allowance that decreased by regular amounts each month. The learning allowance wasscheduled to fall to zero in six months because it was expected that the women could meetstandard output or more by that time. By the second month of the training period, trouble haddeveloped. The women had progressed more slowly than had been anticipated, and it appearedthat their production level would stabilize somewhat below the planned level. Some of the womencomplained about the speed that was expected of them, and a few of them quit. There wasevidence of resistance to the new situation. Through the counsel of a consultant, the supervisor finally decided to bring the womentogether for general discussions of working conditions. After two meetings in which relationsbetween the work group and the supervisor were somewhat improved, a third meeting producedthe suggestion that control of the conveyor speed be turned over to the work group. The womenexplained that they felt that they could keep up with the speed of the conveyor but that they couldnot work at that pace all day long. They wished to be able to adjust the speed of the belt,depending on how they felt. After consultation, the supervisor had a control marked, “low, medium, and fast” installedat the booth of the group leader, who could adjust the speed of the conveyor anywhere betweenthe lower and upper limits that had been set. The women were delighted and spent many lunch WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) hours deciding how the speed should be varied from hour to hour throughout the day. Within aweek, a pattern had emerged: the first half-hour of the shift was run on what the women called“medium speed” (a dial setting slightly above the point marked “medium”). The next two andone-half hours were run at high speed, and the half-hour before lunch and the half-hour afterlunch were run at low speed. The rest of the afternoon was run at high speed, with the exceptionof the last 45 minutes of the shift, which were run at medium speed. In view of the women’s report of satisfaction and ease in their work, it is interesting to notethat the original speed was slightly below medium on the dial of the new control. The averagespeed at which the women were running the belt was on the high side of the dial. Few, if any,empty hooks entered the drying oven, and inspection showed no increase of rejects from the paintroom. Production increased, and within three weeks the women were operating at 30 to 50percent above the level that had been expected according to the original design. Evaluate the experience of the Hovey and Beard Company as it reflects on job design,human relationships, and the supervisor’s role. How would you react as the supervisor to thesituation where workers determine how the work will be performed? If you were designing thespray-painting set-up, would you design it differently? [From J. V. Clark, “A Healthy Organization,” California Management Review, 4, 1962]2. PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AT WHIRLPOOL Workers and management at Whirlpool Appliance’s Benton Harbor plant in Michigan haveset an example of how to achieve productivity gains, which has benefited not only the companyand its stockholders, but also Whirlpool customers, and the workers themselves. Things weren’t always rosy at the plant. Productivity and quality weren’t good. Neitherwere labor-management relations. Workers hid defective parts so management wouldn’t findthem, and when machines broke down, workers would simply sit down until sooner or latersomeone came to fix it. All that changed in the late 1980s. Faced with the possibility that theplant would be shut down, management and labor worked together to find a way to keep the plantopen. The way was to increase productivity-producing more without using more resources.Interestingly, the improvement in productivity didn’t come by spending money on fancy machines.Rather, it was accomplished by placing more emphasis on quality. That was a shift from the oldway, which emphasized volume, often at the expense of quality. To motivate workers, thecompany agreed to gain sharing, a plan that rewarded workers by increasing their pay forproductivity increases. The company overhauled the manufacturing process, and taught its workers how to improvequality. As quality improved, productivity went up because more of the output was good, andcosts went down because of fewer defective parts that had to be scrapped or reworked. Costsof inventory also decreased, because fewer spare parts were needed to replace defective output,both at the factory and for warranty repairs. And workers have been able to see the connectionbetween their efforts to improve quality and productivity. Not only was Whirlpool able to use the productivity gains to increase workers’ pay, it wasalso able to hold that lid on price increases and to funnel some of the savings into research. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTQuestions 1. What were the two key things that Whirlpool management did to achieve productivity gains? 2. Who has benefited from the productivity gains? 3. How are productivity and quality related? 4. How can a company afford to pay it workers for productivity gains? (Source: Based on “A Whirlpool Factory Raises Productivity-And Pay of Workers:’ by Rick Wartzman,from The Wall Street journal, 1992.)3. STATE AUTOMOBILE LICENSE RENEWALS Vinay, manager of a metropolitan branch office of the state department of motor vehicles,attempted to perform an analysis of the driver’s license renewal operations. Several steps wereto be performed in the process. After examining the license renewal process, he identified thesteps and associated times required to perform each step as shown in table below. State Automobile License Renewals Process Times Job Average Time to Perform (Seconds) 1 Review renewal application for correctness 15 2 Process and record payments 30 3 Check file for violations and restrictions 60 4 Conduct Eye Test 40 5 Photograph applicant 20 6 Issue temporary license 30 Vinay found that each step was’ assigned to a different person. Each application was aseparate process in the sequence shown in the exhibit. Vinay determined that his office shouldbe prepared to accommodate the maximum demand of processing 120 renewal applicantsper hour. He observed that the work was unevenly divided among the clerks, and that the clerk whowas responsible for checking violations tended to shortcut her task to keep up with the otherclerks. Long lines built up during the maximum demand periods. Vinay also found that general clerks who were each paid Rs.12.00 per hour-handled jobs1,2,3, and 4. Job 5 was performed by a photographer paid Rs.16 per hour, Job 6, the issuing oftemporary licenses, was required by state policy to be handled by a uniformed motor vehicleofficer. Officers were paid Rs.18 per hour, but they could be assigned to any job exceptphotography. A review of the jobs indicated that job 1, reviewing the application for correctness, had tobe performed before any other step. Similarly, job 6, issuing the temporary license, could not beperformed until all the other steps were completed. The branch offices were charged Rs.20 perhour for each camera to perform photography. WORK STUDY (TIME AND MOTION STUDY) ! Vinay was under severe pressure to increase productivity and reduce costs, but the regionaldirector of the department of motor vehicles also told him that he had better accommodate thedemand for renewals. Otherwise, “heads would roll.”Questions 1. What is the maximum number of applications per hour that can be handled by the present configuration of the process? 2. How many applications can be processed per hour if a second clerk is added to check for violations? 3. Assuming the addition of one more clerk, what is the maximum number of applications the process can handle? 4. How would you suggest modifying the process to accommodate 120 applications per hour?

MAKING HOTPLATES Group of 10 workers were responsible for assembling hotplates (instruments for heatingsolutions to a given temperature) for hospital and medical laboratory use. A number of differentmodels of hotplates were being manufactured. Some had a vibrating device so that the solutioncould be mixed while being heated. Others heated only test tubes. Still others could heat solutionsin a variety of different containers. With the appropriate small tools, each worker assembled part of a hotplate. The partiallycompleted hotplate was placed on a moving belt, to be carried from one assembly station to thenext. When the hotplate was completed, an inspector would check it over to ensure that it wasworking properly. Then the last worker would place it in a specially prepared cardboard box forshipping. The assembly line had been carefully balanced by industrial engineers, who had used a timeand motion study to break the job down into subassembly tasks, each requiring about threeminutes to accomplish. The amount of time calculated for each subassembly had also been“balanced” so that the task performed by each worker was supposed to take almost exactly thesame amount of time. The workers were paid a straight hourly rate. However, there were some problems. Morale seemed to be low, and the inspector wasfinding a relatively high percentage of badly assembled hotplates. Controllable rejects-those“caused” by the operator rather than by faulty materials-were running about 23 percent. After discussing the situation, management decided to try something new. The workerswere called together and asked if they would like to build the hotplates individually. The workersdecided they would like to try this approach, provided they could go back to the old program ifthe new one did not work well. After several days of training, each worker began to assemblethe entire hotplate. The change was made at about the middle of the year. Productivity climbed quickly. By theend of the year, it had leveled off at about 84 percent higher than during the first half of the year,although no other changes had been made in the department or its personnel. Controllable rejects &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENThad dropped from 23 percent to 1 percent during the same period. Absenteeism had droppedfrom 8 percent to less than 1 percent. The workers had responded positively to the change, andtheir morale was higher. As one person put it, “Now, it is my hotplate.” Eventually, the rejectrate dropped so low that the assembly workers themselves did all routine final inspection. Thefulltime inspector was transferred to another job in the organization.Questions 1. What changes in the work situation might account for the increase in productivity and the decrease in controllable rejects? 2. What might account for the drop in absenteeism and the increase in morale? 3. What were the major changes in the situation? Which changes were under the control of the manager? Which were controlled by workers? 4. What might happen if the workers went back to the old assembly line method? (Source: The Modern Manager, by Edgar F.

The dictionarydefines maintenance as “the work of keeping something in proper condition, upkeep.” This wouldimply that maintenance should be actions taken to prevent a device or component from failingor to repair normal equipment degradation experienced with the operation of the device to keepit in proper working order. Data obtained in many studies over the past decade indicates that mostprivate and Government facilities do not expend the necessary resources to maintain equipmentin proper working order. They wait for equipment failure to occur and then take whatever actionsare necessary to repair or replace the equipment. Nothing lasts forever and all equipment hasassociated with it some predefined life expectancy or operational life. 8.2 OBJECTIVES OF MAINTENANCEEquipments are an important resource which is constantly used for adding value to products. So,it must be kept at the best operating condition. Otherwise, there will be excessive downtime andalso interruption of production if it is used in a mass production line. Poor working of equipments 205 $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTwill lead to quality related problems. Hence, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the equipmentsin good operating conditions with economical cost. Hence, we need an integrated approach tominimize the cost of maintenance. In certain cases, the equipment will be obsolete over a periodof time. If a firm wants to be in the same business competitively, it has to take decision onwhether to replace the equipment or to retain the old equipment by taking the cost of maintenanceand operation into account. 8.3 TYPES OF MAINTENANCEThe design life of most equipment requires periodic maintenance. Belts need adjustment, alignmentneeds to be maintained, proper lubrication on rotating equipment is required, and so on. In somecases, certain components need replacement, e.g., a wheel bearing on a motor vehicle, to ensurethe main piece of equipment (in this case a car) last for its design life. Different approaches havebeen developed to know how maintenance can be performed to ensure equipment reaches orexceeds its design life. In addition to waiting for a piece of equipment to fail (reactive maintenance)the other approaches are preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance, or reliability centeredmaintenance.8.3.1 Breakdown (Reactive) MaintenanceBreakdown maintenance is basically the ‘run it till it breaks’ maintenance mode. No actionsor efforts are taken to maintain the equipment as the designer originally intended to ensuredesign life is reached. Studies as recent indicate that, this is still the predominant mode ofmaintenance. Advantages to breakdown maintenance can be viewed as a double-edged sword. If we aredealing with new equipment, we can expect minimal incidents of failure. If our maintenanceprogram is purely reactive, we will not expend manpower or incur capital cost until somethingbreaks. Since we do not see any associated maintenance cost, we could view this period assaving money. In reality, during the time we believe we are saving maintenance and capital cost,we are really spending more money than we would have under a different maintenance approach.We are spending more money associated with capital cost because, while waiting for the equipmentto break, we are shortening the life of the equipment resulting in more frequent replacement. Wemay incur cost upon failure of the primary device associated with its failure causing the failureof a secondary device. This is an increased cost we would not have experienced if our maintenanceprogram was more proactive. Our labour cost associated with repair will probably be higher than normal because thefailure will most likely require more extensive repairs than would have been required if the pieceof equipment had not been run to failure. Chances are the piece of equipment will fail during offhours or close to the end of the normal workday. If it is a critical piece of equipment that needsto be back on-line quickly, we will have to pay maintenance overtime cost. Since we expect torun equipment to failure, we will require a large material inventory of repair parts. This is a costwe could minimize under a different maintenance strategy. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT %Advantages 1. Involves low cost investment for maintenance. 2. Less staff is required.Disadvantages 1. Increased cost due to unplanned downtime of equipment. 2. Increased labour cost, especially if overtime is needed. 3. Cost involved with repair or replacement of equipment. 4. Possible secondary equipment or process damage from equipment failure. 5. Inefficient use of staff resources.8.3.2 Preventive MaintenancePreventive maintenance can be defined as, “Actions performed on a time or machine-run-basedschedule that detect, preclude, or mitigate degradation of a component or system with the aim ofsustaining or extending its useful life through controlling degradation to an acceptable level.” Preventive maintenance is a means to increase the reliability of their equipment. By simplyexpending the necessary resources to conduct maintenance activities intended by the equipmentdesigner, equipment life is extended and its reliability is increased. In addition to an increase inreliability, lot of amount will be saved over that of a program just using reactive maintenance.Studies indicate that this savings can amount to as much as 12% to 18% on the average.Advantages 1. Cost effective in many capital intensive processes. 2. Flexibility allows for the adjustment of maintenance periodicity. 3. Increased component life cycle. 4. Energy savings. 5. Reduced equipment or process failure. 6. Estimated 12% to 18% cost savings over reactive maintenance program.Disadvantages 1. Catastrophic failures still likely to occur. 2. Labour intensive. 3. Includes performance of unneeded maintenance. 4. Potential for incidental damage to components in conducting unneeded maintenance. Depending on the facilities current maintenance practices, present equipment reliability, andfacility downtime, there is little doubt that many facilities purely reliant on reactive maintenancecould save much more than 18% by instituting a proper preventive maintenance program. While preventive maintenance is not the optimum maintenance program, it does have severaladvantages over that of a purely reactive program. By performing the preventive maintenance &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTas the equipment designer envisioned, we will extend the life of the equipment closer to design.This translates into dollar savings. Preventive maintenance (lubrication, filter change, etc.) willgenerally run the equipment more efficiently resulting in dollar savings. While we will not preventequipment catastrophic failures, we will decrease the number of failures. Minimizing failurestranslate into maintenance and capital cost savings.8.3.3 Predictive MaintenancePredictive maintenance can be defined as “Measurements that detect the onset of a degradationmechanism, thereby allowing causal stressors to be eliminated or controlled prior to any significantdeterioration in the component physical state. Results indicate current and future functionalcapability”. Basically, predictive maintenance differs from preventive maintenance by basing maintenanceneed on the actual condition of the machine rather than on some preset schedule. Preventivemaintenance is time-based. Activities such as changing lubricant are based on time, like calendartime or equipment run time. For example, most people change the oil in their vehicles every 3,000to 5,000 miles travelled. This is effectively basing the oil change needs on equipment run time.No concern is given to the actual condition and performance capability of the oil. It is changedbecause it is time. This methodology would be analogous to a preventive maintenance task. If,on the other hand, the operator of the car discounted the vehicle run time and had the oil analyzedat some periodicity to determine its actual condition and lubrication properties, he may be ableto extend the oil change until the vehicle had travelled 10,000 miles. This is the fundamentaldifference between predictive maintenance and preventive maintenance, whereby predictivemaintenance is used to define needed maintenance task based on quantified material/equipmentcondition. There are many advantages of predictive maintenance. A well-orchestrated predictivemaintenance program will eliminate catastrophic equipment failures. Schedule of maintenanceactivities can be made to minimize or delete overtime cost. It is possible to minimize inventoryand order parts, as required, well ahead of time to support the downstream maintenance needsand optimize the operation of the equipment, saving energy cost and increasing plant reliability.Past studies have estimated that a properly functioning predictive maintenance program canprovide a savings of 8% to 12% over a program utilizing preventive maintenance alone. Dependingon a facility’s reliance on reactive maintenance and material condition, it could easily recognizesavings opportunities exceeding 30% to 40%. Independent surveys indicate the following industrialaverage savings resultant from initiation of a functional predictive maintenance program: 1. Return on investment—10 times 2. Reduction in maintenance costs—25% to 30% 3. Elimination of breakdowns—70% to 75% 4. Reduction in downtime—35% to 45% 5. Increase in production—20% to 25%. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT Advantages 1. Increased component operational life/availability. 2. Allows for pre-emptive corrective actions. 3. Decrease in equipment or process downtime. 4. Decrease in costs for parts and labour. 5. Better product quality. 6. Improved worker and environmental safety. 7. Improved worker moral. 8. Energy savings. 9. Estimated 8% to 12% cost savings over preventive maintenance program.Disadvantages 1. Increased investment in diagnostic equipment. 2. Increased investment in staff training. 3. Savings potential not readily seen by management.Concept of Reliability in MaintenanceReliability is the probability of survival under a given operating environment. For example, thetime between consecutive failures of a refrigerator where continuous working is required is ameasure of its reliability. If this time is more, the product is said to have high reliability. In a textile mill, generally the light is maintained at a minimum specified level. To achievethis, let us assume that there are 100 bulbs in use and the guaranteed life time of these bulbsis 5000 hours. If we collect statistics about the number of bulbs survived till 5000 hours, we cancompute the reliability of the bulbs. In this case, Number of bulbs survived till the specified time limit Reliability = Failurerate = Number of bulbs used If the number of bulbs survived till 5000 hours is 80, then we can say that the reliability is0.8 (i.e., 80/100) The reliability of railway signalling system, aircraft, and power plant are some of the interestingexamples for demonstrating the reliability concept. In these cases, a failure will lead to heavypenalty. The concept of reliability can be matched with systems concept. Generally, products/equipmentswill have many components which may function with serial relationship or parallel relationship. So,the individual component’s reliability affects the reliability of the product. Hence, enough attentionmust be given at the design, stage such that the product’s reliability is maximized. The cost ofmaintenance is also to be considered along with the reliability while improving it. The general failure pattern of any product is given in Fig. 8.1. This is called bath-tub curve.In Fig. 8.1, there will be large number of failures in the early period. This is mainly due to non-alignment while shipping the product, or misfit while manufacturing (assembling), or very highinitial friction between moving parts, etc. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Fig. 8.1 Product failure rateReliability ImprovementThe reliability of a system/product depends on many factors. So, we should concentrate at thegrassroot level to improve product’s reliability. Some of the ways of improving systems reliability are listed below: l Improved design of components l Simplification of product structure l Usage of better production equipments l Better quality standards l Better testing standards l Sufficient number of standby units l Usage of preventive maintenance if necessary at appropriate time. 8.4 MAINTENANCE PLANNINGPlanning of maintenance jobs basically deals with answering two questions, ‘what’ and ‘How’of the job; ‘what activities are to be done?’ and ‘how those jobs and activities are to be done?’While answering these two questions, other supplementary questions are to be answered, e.g.,‘where the jobs is to be done?’ and ‘why the job is to be done?’ etc., but all these will be helpingin developing ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the job. It is very essential that engineering knowledge mustbe applied extensively to maintenance jobs for development of appropriate job plans using mostsuited techniques, tools materials and special facilities etc. As the job planning forms the basic foundations, over which the efficiency and cost ofactions depends, persons responsible for job planning should have adequate capabilities, such as,knowledge about jobs and available techniques, facilities and resources, analytical ability, conceptuallogical ability and judgmental courage etc. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT Steps of Job Planning The main steps to be followed for proper job planning are: 1. Knowledge base: It includes knowledge about equipment, job, available techniques,materials and facilities. 2. Job investigation at site: It gives a clear perception of the total jobs. 3. Identify and document the work: Knowing the earlier two steps and knowing theneeds of preventive, predictive and other maintenance jobs. 4. Development of repair plan: Preparation of step by step procedures which wouldaccomplish the work with the most economical use of time, manpower and material. 5. Preparation tools and facilities list indicating the needs of special tools, tackles andfacilities needed. 6. Estimation of time required to do the job with work measurement technique andcritical path analysis. 8.5 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULINGScheduling is the function of coordinating all of the logistical issue around the issues regardingthe execution phase of the work. Scheduled of maintenance jobs basically deals with answeringtwo questions—‘Who’ and ‘When’ of job, i.e., “who would do the job” and “when the job wouldbe started and done”. Effective scheduling essentially needs realistic thinking, based on substantial data and records.Majority of scheduling work needs to occur in areas such as overhead labour hours safety andtoolbox meetings, break times and training times etc. Addition of corrective and approvedimprovement actions as dictated by the prioritization system and operations plan etc.Requirements for SchedulersA scheduler should also have knowledge about job, techniques, facilities, analytical ability andjudgmental courage. The scheduler must obtain knowledge/information about following ability andjudgmental courage. The scheduler must obtain information about following facts, before startinghis job: 1. Manpower availability by trade, location, shift, crew arrangement and permissible overtime limit etc. 2. Man hour back log on current or unfinished jobs. 3. Availability of the equipment or area where the work has to be performed. 4. Availability of proper tools, tackles, spares, consumables, structural and other required materials. 5. Availability of external manpower and their capabilities; these may be from other shops/ departments of the plant or from contractors (local, nearby, ancillary etc). 6. Availability of special equipments, jigs/fixtures, special lifting and handling facilities and cranes etc. This should also include labour and time saving devices like pneumatic hammers and excavators etc. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 7. Starting date of the job; also often completion time of total job is predetermined and, in that case, resources are to be arranged accordingly. 8. Past schedules and charts (updated) if the same job has been done earlier, etc. 8.6 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE TECHNIQUESDifferent types of schedules are made suiting the respective job plans and different techniquesare used for making and following those schedules. The first step of all scheduling is to breakthe job into small measurable elements, called activities and to arrange them in logical sequencesconsidering the preceding, concurrent and succeeding activities so that a succeeding activityshould follow preceding activities and concurrent activities can start together. Arranging these activities in different fashion makes different types of schedules. They areas follows: 1. Weekly general schedule is made to provide weeks worth of work for each employee in an area. 2. Daily schedule is developed to provide a day’s work for each maintenance employee of the area. 3. Gantt charts are used to represent the timings of tasks required to complete a project. 4. Bar charts used for technical analysis which represents the relative magnitude of the values. 5. PERT/CPM are used to find the time required for completion of the job and helps in the allocation of resources. [Note: Discussed in detail in Chapter 5.]8.6.1 Modern Scientific Maintenance MethodsReliability centered maintenance: Reliability centered maintenance (RCM) is defined as “aprocess used to determine the maintenance requirements of any physical asset in its operatingcontext”. Basically, RCM methodology deals with some key issues not dealt with by other maintenanceprograms. It recognizes that all equipment in a facility is not of equal importance to either theprocess or facility safety. It recognizes that equipment design and operation differs and thatdifferent equipment will have a higher probability to undergo failures from different degradationmechanisms than others. It also approaches the structuring of a maintenance program recognizingthat a facility does not have unlimited financial and personnel resources and that the use of bothneed to be prioritized and optimized. In a nutshell, RCM is a systematic approach to evaluate afacility’s equipment and resources to best mate the two and result in a high degree of facilityreliability and cost-effectiveness. RCM is highly reliant on predictive maintenance but also recognizes that maintenanceactivities on equipment that is inexpensive and unimportant to facility reliability may best be leftto a reactive maintenance approach. The following maintenance program breakdowns of continually MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT !top-performing facilities would echo the RCM approach to utilize all available maintenanceapproaches with the predominant methodology being predictive. l&lt;10% Reactive l 25% to 35% Preventive l 45% to 55% Predictive. Because RCM is so heavily weighted in utilization of predictive maintenance technologies,its program advantages and disadvantages mirror those of predictive maintenance. In addition tothese advantages, RCM will allow a facility to more closely match resources to needs whileimproving reliability and decreasing cost.Advantages (a) Can be the most efficient maintenance program. (b) Lower costs by eliminating unnecessary maintenance or overhauls. (c) Minimize frequency of overhauls. (d) Reduced probability of sudden equipment failures. (e) Able to focus maintenance activities on critical components. (f) Increased component reliability. (g) Incorporates root cause analysis.Disadvantages (a) Can have significant startup cost, training, equipment, etc. (b) Savings potential not readily seen by management.How to Initiate Reliability Centered Maintenance?The road from a purely reactive program to a RCM program is not an easy one. The followingis a list of some basic steps that will help to get moving down this path. 1. Develop a master equipment list identifying the equipment in your facility. 2. Prioritize the listed components based on importance to process. 3. Assign components into logical groupings. 4. Determine the type and number of maintenance activities required and periodicity using: l Manufacturer technical manuals l Machinery history l Root cause analysis findings—Why did it fail? l Good engineering judgment 5. Assess the size of maintenance staff. 6. Identify tasks that may be performed by operations maintenance personnel. 7. Analyze equipment failure modes and effects. 8. Identify effective maintenance tasks or mitigation strategies. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT8.6.2 Six Sigma MaintenanceIt is the application of six sigma principles in maintenance. Six sigma is a maintenance processthat focuses on reducing the variation in business production processes. By reducing variation,a business can achieve tighter control over its operational systems, increasing their costeffectiveness and encouraging productivity breakthrough. Six sigma is a term created at Motorola to describe the goal and process used to achievebreakthrough levels of quality improvement. Sigma is the Greek symbol used by statisticians torefer to the six standard deviations. The term six sigma refers to a measure of process variation(six standard deviations) that translates into an error or defect rate of 3.4 parts per million. Toachieve quality performance of six sigma level, special sets of quality improvement methodologiesand statistical tools developed. These improvement methods and statistical tools are taught to asmall group of workmen known as six sigma champions who are assigned full-time responsibilityto define, measure, analyze, improve and control process quality. They also facilitate theimprovement process by removing the organizational roadblocks encountered. Six sigmamethodologies improve any existing business process by constantly reviewing and re-tuning theprocess. To achieve this, six sigma uses a methodology known as DMAIC (Define opportunities,Measure performance, Analyse opportunity, Improve performance, Control performance). Thissix sigma process is also called DMAIC process. Six sigma relies heavily on statistical techniques to reduce failures and it incorporates thebasic principles and techniques used in Business, Statistics, and Engineering. Six sigma methodologiescan also be used to create a brand new business process from ground up using design for sixsigma principles.SIX SIGMA MAINTENANCE PROCESSThe steps of six sigma maintenance are same as DMAIC process. To apply six sigma inmaintenance, the work groups that have a good understanding of preventive maintenance techniquesin addition to a strong leadership commitment. Six sigma helps in two principal inputs to themaintenance cost equation: Reduce or eliminate the need to do maintenance (reliability of equipment),and improve the effectiveness of the resources needed to accomplish maintenance. Following arethe steps involved in six sigma maintenance process.Define This step involves determining benchmarks, determining availability and reliability requirements,getting customer commitments and mapping the flow process.Measure This step involves development of failure measurement techniques and tools, data collectionprocess, compilation and display of data.Analysis This step involves checking and verifying the data and drawing conclusions from data. It alsoinvolves determining improvement opportunities, finding root causes and map causes.Improve This step involves creating model equipment and maintenance process, total maintenanceplan and schedule and implementing those plans and schedule. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT #Control This step involves monitoring the improved programme. Monitor improves performance andassesses effectiveness and will make necessary adjustments for the deviation if exists.8.6.3 Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)Enterprise asset management is an information management system that connects alldepartments and disciplines within a company making them an integrated unit. EAM is alsoreferred as computerised maintenance management system. It is the organized and systematictracking of an organization’s physical assets i.e., its plant, equipment and facilities. EAM aimsat best utilisation of its physical assets. It ensures generation of quality data and timely flow ofrequired data throughout the organization. EAM reduces paper work, improves the quality,quantity and timeliness of the information and provides information to technicians at the point ofperformance and gives workers access to job specific information at the work site.8.6.4 Lean MaintenanceLean maintenance is the application of lean principle in maintenance environments. Leansystem recognises seven forms of waste in maintenance. They are over production, waiting,transportation, process waste, inventory, waste motion and defects. In lean maintenance, thesewastes are identified and efforts are made for the continuous improvement in process by eliminatingthe wastes. Thus, lean maintenance leads to maximise yield, productivity and profitability. Lean maintenance is basically equipment reliability focussed and reduces need for maintenancetroubleshooting and repairs. Lean maintenance protects equipments and system from the routecauses of malfunctions, failures and downtime stress. From the sources of waste uptime can beimproved and cost can be lowered for maintenance.8.6.5 Computer Aided MaintenanceFor effective discharge of the maintenance function, a well designed information system is anessential tool. Such systems serve as effective decision support tools in the maintenance planningand execution. For optimal maintenance scheduling, large volume of data pertaining to men,money and equipment is required to be handled. This is a difficult task to be performed manually.For a planned and advanced maintenance system use of computers is essential. Here programmesare prepared to have an available inputs processed by the computer. Such a computer basedsystem can be used as and when required for effective performance of the maintenance tasks.There are wide varieties of software package available in the market for different types ofmaintenance systems. A computerised maintenance system includes the following aspects: l Development of a database l Analysis of past records if available l Development of maintenance schedules l Availability of maintenance materials $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT l Feedback control system l Project management. Following are some computer based maintenance systems which can be implemented: Job card system: It is essential to prepare a job card for each component to record themaintenance work carried out or the work to be done. Job card shows the plant code, equipmentcode, the job code, the nature of the jobs, the start time and finishing time of the card, man-hourspent and etc. The use of computers facilitates the issue of job cards, recording of job historyand control of manpower. Spare part life monitoring system: Under this system, information about a spare partsuch as its description, anticipated life and date of its installation in equipment is recorded. Asand when a particular sparepart is replaced during breakdown failures or scheduled maintenance,the updating of this information is done in their respective files stored in the computer. This helpsto prepare the following reports: l Spares repeatability in various machines indicating the performance of such spare parts. l Comparisons of the actual life with the estimated life of the spare parts. Spare parts tracking system: In most of the cases maximum time is consumed inprocurement of spare parts. The total time required to rectify the breakdown is summation ofthe time to identify the cause of the failure, time to determine the requirements of spare parts,time to procure spare parts and the time to rectify the failure. In a computerised system, thespare part tracking system is beneficial in getting required material at the earliest. A spare partfile is created that contains the information about the material code, spare part identificationnumber, the assembly or sub-assembly number and the place where the spare part is used.This helps in knowing the current position about a particular spare part and facilitates timelyrequirement for future demands. 8.7 TOTAL PRODUCTIVE MAINTENANCE (TPM)Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a maintenance program, which involves a newly definedconcept for maintaining plants and equipment. The goal of the TPM program is to markedlyincrease production while, at the same time, increasing employee morale and job satisfaction. Itcan be considered as the medical science of machines. TPM brings maintenance into focus as a necessary and vitally important part of the business.It is no longer regarded as a non-profit activity. Downtime for maintenance is scheduled as a partof the manufacturing day and, in some cases, as an integral part of the manufacturing process.The goal is to hold emergency and unscheduled maintenance to a minimum. TPM was introduced to achieve the following objectives. The important ones are listedbelow. l Avoid wastage in a quickly changing economic environment. l Producing goods without reducing product quality. l Reduce cost. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT % l Produce a low batch quantity at the earliest possible time. l Goods send to the customers must be non-defective.8.7.1 Similarities and Differences between TQM and TPMThe TPM program closely resembles the popular Total Quality Management (TQM) program.Many of the tools such as, employee empowerment, benchmarking, documentation, etc. used inTQM are used to implement and optimize TPM. Following are the similarities between the two: 1. Total commitment to the program by upper level management is required in both programmes, 2. Employees must be empowered to initiate corrective action, and 3. A long-range outlook must be accepted as TPM may take a year or more to implement and is an on-going process. Changes in employee mind-set toward their job responsibilities must take place as well. The differences between TQM and TPM are summarized below. Category TQM TPM Object Quality (Output and effects) Equipment (Input and cause) Mains of attaining Systematize the management. Employees participation and it is goal It is software oriented hardware oriented Target Quality for PPM Elimination of losses and wastes.8.7.2 Pillars of TPMPILLAR 1-5S TPM starts with 5S. Problems cannot be clearly seen when the work place is unorganized.Cleaning and organizing the workplace helps the team to uncover problems. Making problemsvisible is the first step of improvement. &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Japanese term English translation Equivalent ‘S’ term Seiri Organization Sort Seiton Tidiness Systematise Seiso Cleaning Sweep Seiketsu Standardisation Standardise Shitsuke Discipline Self-disciplineSEIRI—Sort out This means sorting and organizing the items as critical, important, frequently used items,useless, or items that are not need as of now. Unwanted items can be salvaged. Critical itemsshould be kept for use nearby and items that are not be used in near future, should be storedin some place. For this step, the worth of the item should be decided based on utility and not cost.As a result of this step, the search time is reduced. Priority Frequency of use How to use Low Less than once per year, Throw away, Store away from the Once per year&lt;workplace Average At least 2/6 months, Store together but offline Once per month, Once per week High Once per day Locate at the workplaceSEITON—Organise The concept here is that “Each items has a place, and only one place”. The items shouldbe placed back after usage at the same place. To identify items easily, name plates and colouredtags has to be used. Vertical racks can be used for this purpose, and heavy items occupy thebottom position in the racks.SEISO—Shine the Workplace This involves cleaning the work place free of burrs, grease, oil, waste, scrap etc. No looselyhanging wires or oil leakage from machines.SEIKETSU—Standardization Employees has to discuss together and decide on standards for keeping the work place/machines/pathways neat and clean. This standards are implemented for whole organization andare tested/inspected randomly.SHITSUKE—Self-discipline Considering 5S as a way of life and bring about self-discipline among the employees of theorganization. This includes wearing badges, following work procedures, punctuality, dedication tothe organization etc.PILLAR 2—JISHU HOZEN (AUTONOMOUS MAINTENANCE)This pillar is geared towards developing operators to be able to take care of small maintenancetasks, thus freeing up the skilled maintenance people to spend time on more value added activity MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT and technical repairs. The operators are responsible for upkeep of their equipment to prevent itfrom deteriorating.Steps in JISHU HOZEN 1. Train the employees: Educate the employees about TPM, its advantages, JH advantagesand steps in JH. Educate the employees about abnormalities in equipments. 2. Initial cleanup of machines l Supervisor and technician should discuss and set a date for implementing step 1. l Arrange all items needed for cleaning. l On the arranged date, employees should clean the equipment completely with the help of maintenance department. l Dust, stains, oils and grease has to be removed. l Following are the things that have to be taken care while cleaning. They are oil leakage, loose wires, unfastened nits and bolts and worn out parts. l After clean up problems are categorized and suitably tagged. White tags are place where operators can solve problems. Pink tag is placed where the aid of maintenance department is needed. l Contents of tag are transferred to a register. l Make note of area, which were inaccessible. l Finally close the open parts of the machine and run the machine. 3. Counter measures l Inaccessible regions had to be reached easily, e.g., if there are many screw to open a flywheel door, hinge door can be used. Instead of opening a door for inspecting the machine, acrylic sheets can be used. l To prevent work out of machine parts necessary action must be taken. l Machine parts should be modified to prevent accumulation of dirt and dust. 4. Tentative standard l JH schedule has to be made and followed strictly. l Schedule should be made regarding cleaning, inspection and lubrication and it also should include details like when, what and how. 5. General inspection l The employees are trained in disciplines like pneumatics, electrical, hydraulics, lubricant and coolant, drives, bolts, nuts and safety. l This is necessary to improve the technical skills of employees and to use inspection manuals correctly. l After acquiring this new knowledge the employees should share this with others. l By acquiring this new technical knowledge, the operators are now well aware of machine parts. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 6. Autonomous inspection l New methods of cleaning and lubricating are used. l Each employee prepares his own autonomous chart/schedule in consultation with supervisor. l Parts which have never given any problem or part which don’t need any inspection are removed from list permanently based on experience. l Including good quality machine parts. This avoid defects due to poor JH. • Inspection that is made in preventive maintenance is included in JH. l The frequency of cleanup and inspection is reduced based on experience. 7. Standardization l Up to the previous stem only the machinery/equipment was the concentration. However, in this step the surroundings of machinery are organized. Necessary items should be organized, such that there is no searching and searching time is reduced. l Work environment is modified such that there is no difficulty in getting any item. l Everybody should follow the work instructions strictly. l Necessary spares for equipments is planned and procured. 8. Autonomous management l OEE and OPE and other TPM targets must be achieved by continuous improve through Kaizen. l PDCA (Plan, Do, Check and Act) cycle must be implemented for Kaizen.PILLAR 3—KAIZEN‘Kai’ means change, and ‘Zen’ means good (for the better). Basically Kaizen is for smallimprovements, but carried out on a continual basis and involve all people in the organization.Kaizen is opposite to big spectacular innovations. Kaizen requires no or little investment. Theprinciple behind is that “a very large number of small improvements are more effective in anorganizational environment than a few improvements of large value.” This pillar is aimed atreducing losses in the workplace that affect our efficiencies. By using a detailed and thoroughprocedure we eliminate losses in a systematic method using various Kaizen tools. These activitiesare not limited to production areas and can be implemented in administrative areas as well.Kaizen Policy 1. Practice concepts of zero losses in every sphere of activity. 2. Relentless pursuit to achieve cost reduction targets in all resources. 3. Relentless pursuit to improve overall plant equipment effectiveness. 4. Extensive use of PM analysis as a tool for eliminating losses. 5. Focus of easy handling of operators.Kaizen Target Achieve and sustain zero loses with respect to minor stops, measurement and adjustments,defects and unavoidable downtimes. It also aims to achieve 30% manufacturing cost reduction. MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT Tools used in Kaizen 1. PM analysis 2. Why-Why analysis 3. Summary of losses 4. Kaizen register 5. Kaizen summary sheet. The objective of TPM is maximization of equipment effectiveness. TPM aims at maximizationof machine utilization and not merely machine availability maximization. As one of the pillars ofTPM activities, Kaizen pursues efficient equipment, operator and material and energy utilization,which is extremes of productivity and aims at achieving substantial effects. Kaizen activities tryto thoroughly eliminate 16 major losses.16 Major Losses in a Organization Loss Category 1. Failure losses—Breakdown loss 2. Setup/adjustment losses 3. Cutting blade loss 4. Start up loss 5. Minor stoppage/Idling loss 6. Speed loss—operating at low speeds 7. Defect/rework loss 8. Scheduled downtime loss 9. Management loss Losses that impede equipment efficiency 10. Operating motion loss Losses that impede human work efficiency 11. Line organization loss 12. Logistic loss 13. Measurement and adjustment loss 14. Energy loss 15. Die, jig and tool breakage loss Losses that impede effective use of 16. Yield loss production resourcesPILLAR 4—PLANNED MAINTENANCEIt is aimed to have trouble free machines and equipments producing defect free products for totalcustomer satisfaction. This breaks maintenance down into 4 ‘families’ or groups, which wasdefined earlier. 1. Preventive maintenance 2. Breakdown maintenance PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 3. Corrective maintenance 4. Maintenance prevention With planned maintenance, we evolve our efforts from a reactive to a proactive method anduse trained maintenance staff to help train the operators to better maintain their equipment.Policy 1. Achieve and sustain availability of machines; 2. Optimum maintenance cost; 3. Reduces spares inventory; and 4. Improve reliability and maintainability of machines.Target 1. Zero equipment failure and breakdown; 2. Improve reliability and maintainability by 50%; 3. Reduce maintenance cost by 20%; and 4. Ensure availability of spares all the time.Six Steps in Planned Maintenance 1. Equipment evaluation and recoding present status; 2. Restore deterioration and improve weakness; 3. Building up information management system; 4. Prepare time based information system, select equipment, parts and members and map out plan; 5. Prepare predictive maintenance system by introducing equipment diagnostic techniques; and 6. Evaluation of planned maintenance.PILLAR 5—QUALITY MAINTENANCEIt is aimed towards customer delight through highest quality through defect free manufacturing.Focus is on eliminating non-conformances in a systematic manner, much like Focused Improvement.We gain understanding of what parts of the equipment affect product quality and begin toeliminate current quality concerns, then move to potential quality concerns. Transition is fromreactive to proactive (Quality Control to Quality Assurance). QM activities is to set equipment conditions that preclude quality defects, based on the basicconcept of maintaining perfect equipment to maintain perfect quality of products. The conditionsare checked and measure in time series to very that measure values are within standard valuesto prevent defects. The transition of measured values is watched to predict possibilities of defectsoccurring and to take counter measures before hand.Policy 1. Defect free conditions and control of equipments; 2. QM activities to support quality assurance; MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT ! 3. Focus of prevention of defects at source; 4. Focus on poka-yoke (fool proof system); 5. In-line detection and segregation of defects; and 6. Effective implementation of operator quality assurance.Target 1. Achieve and sustain customer complaints at zero; 2. Reduce in-process defects by 50%; and 3. Reduce cost of quality by 50%.Data Requirements Quality defects are classified as customer end defects and in house defects. For customer-end data, we have to get data on: 1. Customer end line rejection; and 2. Field complaints. In-house, data include data related to products and data related to process.Data Related to Product 1. Product-wise defects; 2. Severity of the defect and its contribution—major/minor; 3. Location of the defect with reference to the layout; 4. Magnitude and frequency of its occurrence at each stage of measurement; 5. Occurrence trend in beginning and the end of each production/process/changes (like pattern change, ladle/furnace lining etc.); and 6. Occurrence trend with respect to restoration of breakdown/modifications/periodical replacement of quality components.Data Related to Processes 1. The operating condition for individual sub-process related to men, method, material and machine; 2. The standard settings/conditions of the sub-process; and 3. The actual record of the settings/conditions during the defect occurrence.PILLAR 6—TRAININGIt is aimed to have multi-skilled revitalized employees whose morale is high and who has eagerto come to work and perform all required functions effectively and independently. Education isgiven to operators to upgrade their skill. It is not sufficient know only ‘Know-How’ by theyshould also learn ‘Know-Why’. By experience they gain, ‘Know-How’ to overcome a problemwhat to be done. This they do without knowing the root cause of the problem and why they aredoing so. Hence, it becomes necessary to train them on knowing ‘Know-Why’. The employeesshould be trained to achieve the four phases of skill. The goal is to create a factory full ofexperts. The different phase of skills is: &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Phase 1: Do not know. Phase 2: Know the theory but cannot do. Phase 3: Can do but cannot teach. Phase 4: Can do and also teach.Policy 1. Focus on improvement of knowledge, skills and techniques; 2. Creating a training environment for self-learning based on felt needs; 3. Training curriculum/tools/assessment etc. conducive to employee revitalization; and 4. Training to remove employee fatigue and make work enjoyable.Target 1. Achieve and sustain downtime due to want men at zero on critical machines; 2. Achieve and sustain zero losses due to lack of knowledge/skills/techniques; and 3. Aim for 100% participation in suggestion scheme.Steps in Educating and Training Activities 1. Setting policies and priorities and checking present status of education and training; 2. Establish of training system for operation and maintenance skill upgradation; 3. Training the employees for upgrading the operation and maintenance skills; 4. Preparation of training calendar; 5. Kick-off of the system for training; and 6. Evaluation of activities and study of future approach.PILLAR 7—OFFICE TPMOffice TPM should be started after activating four other pillars of TPM (JH, KK, QM,PM). Office TPM must be followed to improve productivity, efficiency in the administrativefunctions and identify and eliminate losses. This includes analyzing processes and procedurestowards increased office automation. Office TPM addresses twelve major losses. They are: 1. Processing loss; 2. Cost loss including in areas such as, procurement, accounts, marketing, sales leading to high inventories; 3. Communication loss; 4. Idle loss; 5. Set-up loss; 6. Accuracy loss; 7. Office equipment breakdown; 8. Communication channel breakdown, telephone and fax lines; 9. Time spent on retrieval of information; 10. Non availability of correct on-line stock status; MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT # 11. Customer complaints due to logistics; and 12. Expenses on emergency dispatches/purchases.Office TPM and its Benefits 1. Involvement of all people in support functions for focusing on better plant performance; 2. Better utilized work area; 3. Reduce repetitive work; 4. Reduced inventory levels in all parts of the supply chain; 5. Reduced administrative costs; 6. Reduced inventory carrying cost; 7. Reduction in number of files; 8. Reduction of overhead costs (to include cost of non-production/non-capital equipment); 9. Productivity of people in support functions; 10. Reduction in breakdown of office equipment; 11. Reduction of customer complaints due to logistics; 12. Reduction in expenses due to emergency dispatches/purchases; 13. Reduced manpower; and 14. Clean and pleasant work environment.PILLAR 8—SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTTarget 1. Zero accident, 2. Zero health damage, and 3. Zero fires. In this area focus is on to create a safe workplace and a surrounding area that is notdamaged by our process or procedures. This pillar will play an active role in each of the otherpillars on a regular basis. A committee is constituted for this pillar, which comprises representative of officers as wellas workers. The committee is headed by senior vice President (Technical). Utmost importanceto safety is given in the plant. Manager (safety) is looking after functions related to safety. Tocreate awareness among employees various competitions like safety slogans, quiz, drama, posters,etc. related to safety can be organized at regular intervals. Today, with competition in industry at an all time high, TPM may be the only thing thatstands between success and total failure for some companies. It has been proven to be a programthat works. It can be adapted to work not only in industrial plants, but also in construction, buildingmaintenance, transportation, and in a variety of other situations. Employees must be educated andconvinced that TPM is not just another ‘program of the month’ and that management is totallycommitted to the program and the extended time frame necessary for full implementation. Ifeveryone involved in a TPM program does his or her part, an unusually high rate of returncompared to resources invested may be expected. $ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT EXERCISESSection A 1.

They should bedisposed of periodically and proper credit of the amount should be taken in the books of accounts.Hence, waste management places an important role in managing operations. Wastes can becategorised into obsolete, surplus and scrap items. 1. Obsolete items: These are those materials and equipments which are not damaged andwhich have economic worth but which are no longer useful for the Company’s operation owingto many reason such as, changes in product line, process, materials, and so on. 2. Surplus items: These are those materials and equipments which have no immediate usebut have accumulated due to faulty planning, forecasting and purchasing. However, they have ausage value in future. 3. Scrap: It is defined as process wastage, such as, turnings, borings, sprues and flashes.They may have an end-use within the plant having commercial values. Hence, should be disposedof periodically. 9.2 REASONS FOR GENERATION AND ACCUMULATION OF OBSOLETE, SURPLUS AND SCRAP ITEMSFollowing are the reasons for the generation and accumulation of obsolete, surplus and scrap items: 1. Changes in product design: This may lead to some items getting invalid so far as thefinal product is concerned. Hence, the entire stock of such items as surplus obsolete. 227 &amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 2. Rationalization: Sometimes raw materials are renationalized so as to minimise varietyand simplify procurement. The rationalization process renders some items as surplus or obsolete. 3. Cannibalization: When a machine breakdown occurs, sometimes it is rectified usingparts of an identical machine which is not functioning due to various reasons. This process of‘cannibalization’ is not uncommon in many project-based industries. When continued unchecked,this results in obsolete and scrap items. 4. Faulty planning and forecasting: The marketing department may have projected a salesforecast which might be on the higher side. Any material planning has to be based on salesforecasts and this could result in surplus items. Wrong indenting by the user departments alsoleads to accumulation. 5. Faulty purchase practices: Sub-optimizing decisions like buying in bulk to take care ofdiscounts and transportation economy without taking into account factors such as, shelf life,storage space requirements and technological changes once again lead to the accumulation ofsurplus and obsolete stocks. 6. Other causes: Many items are held as insurable spares for many years without anyconsumption. Faulty store-keeping methods, without adequate preservation, lead to spoilage.Inferior materials handling, improper codification and poor manufacturing methods also result inobsolete, surplus and scrap items. Poor maintenance of machine tools may result in excessivetools wear and greater process scrap. 9.3 IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL OF WASTEThe combing process of combining the stock records and movement analysis has been found veryeffective in locating such stocks in the total inventory. Stock issue cards should be combed anditems which have not been consumed (non-moving) for a period of one year must be isolated. Alist of such items and their value in terms of money and time must be made. Similarly, such listsmust be prepared for items which have not moved for 2 years, 3 years, 5 years and above. Suchlists can then be put up to top management for disposal action. Care must be taken to prepare aseparate list of imported spares and insurance items. Such combing and movement analysis mustbe done on a continuous basis. A typical movement analysis statement is shown in Exhibit 9.1. EXHIBIT 9.1 Movement analysis statement Sl. No. Part A Last data of Stock on hand in number Value of number B issue of days consumption orders on description C hand Whenever changes in production programme, design and product lines are contemplated, asenior executive from materials management must definitely be kept in the picture. This helps inseveral ways. He is in a position to inform top management of the amount of stock of materialson hand that are likely to be rendered obsolete if and when the changes are introduced. Thiscould even guide the management as to when the changes could be made so that the existing WASTE MANAGEMENT stock can be consumed in full. The materials manager in turn can freeze further orders for suchmaterials and try to negotiate with the suppliers to take back the stock. For some items he canintroduce the buy-back clause wherein the suppliers takes back items not consumed within aspecific period. For new items which may be required, he can try to develop sources and placeorders so that changes can be expeditiously introduced. All this highlights that a close coordinationis required in order to avoid stock pilling obsolete and surplus items. Selective control based onABC analysis, accurate forecasting techniques and proper preservation minimise such accumulation.In the case of storage of perishable items the Central Warehousing Corporation has deviseda scheme to enlarge its scope to cover certain specialized lines of storage. The schemes drawnup by the corporation include setting up a chain of cold storage plants for potatoes, and fruit, andstorage facilities for certified seeds. Many organizations have introduced formal documentation in introducing changes in designor product. It is called the ‘Effective Point Advice.’ This is popularly known as EPA. Here, theproposed changes, details of new materials and products required, details of materials and theproducts which will be invalid/obsolete when the change occurs and the approximate date whenthe change is expected to be introduced are detailed and circulated to concerned departments.EPA thereby helps in tapering off the stocks of ‘invalid’ items, cancellation of orders for suchitems, placing orders for buying and/or manufacturing new items and related activities. EPAsystems help in better coordination for profitable introduction of changes with minimum ‘sideeffects’ such as the accumulation of obsolete items. The reclamation of scrap has not attracted the attention of the top management in IndianIndustry. Optimal utilization of scrap would allow conservation of the use of scarce naturalresources, such as iron ore. This is because scrap is an important element which goes into themanufacture of steel and castings. It is possible to salvage scrap for usage within the firm in some cases. Press parts are normallymade from sheets and plates. The off-cuts generated during such process can be profitably utilizedin making smaller press components such as washers. Rationalizing the supply size, changes inprocess such as reversing the dies may result in minimization of scrap. Big organizations have afull-fledged scrap salvaging department. These departments segregate the scrap into categories, liketurnings, borings, plate cuttings, endpieces of billets, punching etc. Colour coding the scrap is alsodone to avoid the mixing of different categories of scrap. It is also advantageous to the end-usersin each category and supply of scrap at the appropriate time for production. Often informing theproduction department at the right time about the volume of scrap generated enables prevention ofexcessive scrap through timely changes in production methods, tooling and materials. 9.4 DISPOSAL OF SCRAPDisposal of scrap when handled in an imaginative manner can result in handsome returns to theorganization. An effective disposal requires a compact disposal organization reporting to the materialsmanager, continuous market survey on the prices of various categories of scrap generated in theplant and constant touch with the industries which generate similar scrap and with the end-users. Disposal action follows when the scrap cannot be utilised within the organization. In practice,it has been found that it is profitable to dispose the scrap directly to end-users rather than tomiddlemen who normally form a cartel of their own which leads to lower returns. Before disposalaction it is essential that the scrap is segregated according to metal, size, etc. when the scrap ! PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTis mixed, the return is even lower than the lowest element in the mixture. This is because thebuyer of scrap will have to segregate it at an extra cost. A cursory analysis of scrap prices willreveal that sheet and plate cuttings will fetch fewer amounts per a tonne compared to that ofturnings and borings. Also when costly scrap such as copper, aluminium and tungsten areinvolved, it is imperative that they are segregated as returns are huge and price levels aredifferent. Since scrap is generated process-wise, it comes out in a segregated condition and thereshould be no difficulty in sorting. Auction and Tender methods are frequently used for disposal of scrap. Parties in both thecases are normally required to inspect the scrap in the scrap yard and deposit earnest money. Veryoften the company insists on a basic price depending upon the category of scrap. The disposalsection works, in this aspect, in close coordination with the finance department. In many cases thedisposal section may try to enter into a long-term contact with end-users such as steel plants. Many companies have found to their displeasure scrapped components appearing in themarket and competing with their parts as ‘original equipment’. This is the price which organizationspay for not dismantling and disfiguring the scrap before disposal. Automobile spare parts andbearings especially are prone to such dangers. For this purpose some organizations go to theextent of requesting vehicle users to demolish filters and plugs before scrapping them. This isvery important aspect. In view of the paucity of raw materials and shortage of credit, it is necessary that optimumusage of materials is made and funds tied up in obsolete surplus and scrap items minimised. Thisis only possible when top management shows commitment and support. The employees of theorganizations are naturally the best people to suggest improvements in materials, processes and newend users for scrap. It is they who can minimise the accumulation of scrap through coordination.Therefore, top management should work out formal reward systems to promote employee participationin this matter. A few organizations have suggestion box schemes which pay rich dividends to theorganization. Employees, too get rewards and recognition in the process. EXERCISESSection A 1.

This technology includes automatic machinetools to process parts, automatic assembly machines, industrial robots, automatic material handlingand storage systems, automatic inspection systems for quality control, feedback control andcomputer process control, computer systems for planning, data collection and decision-making tosupport manufacturing activities. 10.2 TYPES OF AUTOMATIONAutomated production systems can be classified into three basic types: 1. Fixed automation, 2. Programmable automation, and 3. Flexible automation. 231 ! PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT1. FIXED AUTOMATIONIt is a system in which the sequence of processing (or assembly) operations is fixed by theequipment configuration. The operations in the sequence are usually simple. It is the integrationand coordination of many such operations into one piece of equipment that makes the systemcomplex. The typical features of fixed automation are: (a) High initial investment for custom–Engineered equipment; (b) High production rates; and (c) Relatively inflexible in accommodating product changes. The economic justification for fixed automation is found in products with very high demandrates and volumes. The high initial cost of the equipment can be spread over a very large numberof units, thus making the unit cost attractive compared to alternative methods of production.Examples of fixed automation include mechanized assembly and machining transfer lines.2. PROGRAMMABLE AUTOMATIONIn this the production equipment is designed with the capability to change the sequence ofoperations to accommodate different product configurations. The operation sequence is controlledby a program, which is a set of instructions coded so that the system can read and interpret them.New programs can be prepared and entered into the equipment to produce new products. Someof the features that characterise programmable automation are: (a) High investment in general-purpose equipment; (b) Low production rates relative to fixed automation; (c) Flexibility to deal with changes in product configuration; and (d) Most suitable for batch production. Automated production systems that are programmable are used in low and medium volumeproduction. The parts or products are typically made in batches. To produce each new batch ofa different product, the system must be reprogrammed with the set of machine instructions thatcorrespond to the new product. The physical setup of the machine must also be changed over:Tools must be loaded, fixtures must be attached to the machine table also be changed machinesettings must be entered. This changeover procedure takes time. Consequently, the typical cyclefor given product includes a period during which the setup and reprogramming takes place,followed by a period in which the batch is produced. Examples of programmed automationinclude numerically controlled machine tools and industrial robots.3. FLEXIBLE AUTOMATIONIt is an extension of programmable automation. A flexible automated system is one that is capableof producing a variety of products (or parts) with virtually no time lost for changeovers from oneproduct to the next. There is no production time lost while reprogramming the system and alteringthe physical setup (tooling, fixtures, and machine setting). Consequently, the system can producevarious combinations and schedules of products instead of requiring that they be made in separatebatches. The features of flexible automation can be summarized as follows: (a) High investment for a custom-engineered system. (b) Continuous production of variable mixtures of products. AUTOMATION !! (c) Medium production rates. (d) Flexibility to deal with product design variations. The essential features that distinguish flexible automation from programmable automationare: (1) the capacity to change part programs with no lost production time; and (2) the capabilityto changeover the physical setup, again with no lost production time. These features allow theautomated production system to continue production without the downtime between batches thatis characteristic of programmable automation. Changing the part programs is generally accomplishedby preparing the programs off-line on a computer system and electronically transmitting theprograms to the automated production system. Therefore, the time required to do the programmingfor the next job does not interrupt production on the current job. Advances in computer systemstechnology are largely responsible for this programming capability in flexible automation. Changingthe physical setup between parts is accomplished by making the changeover off-line and thenmoving it into place simultaneously as the next part comes into position for processing. The useof pallet fixtures that hold the parts and transfer into position at the workplace is one way ofimplementing this approach. For these approaches to be successful; the variety of parts that canbe made on a flexible automated production system is usually more limited than a systemcontrolled by programmable automation. The relative positions of the three types of automation for different production volumes andproduct varieties are depicted in Fig. 10.1. Number of different parts Product volume Fig. 10.1 Types of production automation 10.3 COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURINGThe computers had done a dramatic impact on the development of production automationtechnologies. Nearly all modern production systems are implemented today using computer systems.The term computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) has been coined to denote the pervasive useof computers to design the products, plan the production, control the operations, and perform the !&quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTvarious business related functions needed in a manufacturing firm. Computer Aided Design andComputer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) in another term that is used synonymously with CIM. The good relationship exists between automation and CIM with a conceptual model ofmanufacturing. In a manufacturing firm, the physical activities related to production that takeplace in the factory can be distinguished from the information-processing activities. The physicalactivities include all of the manufacturing processing, assembly, materials handling and inspectionsthat are performed on the product. These operations come in direct contact with the physicalactivities during manufacture. Raw materials flow in one end of the factory and finished productsflow out the other end. The physical activities (processing, handling, etc.) take place inside thefactory. The information-processing functions form a ring that surrounds the factory, providingthe data and knowledge required to produce the product successfully. These information processingfunctions include: (1) business activities, (2) product design, (3) manufacturing planning, and(4) manufacturing control. These four functions form a cycle of events that must accompany thephysical production activities. 10.4 REASONS FOR AUTOMATIONFollowing are some of the reasons for automation: 1. Increased productivity: Automation of manufacturing operations holds the promise ofincreasing the productivity of labour. This means greater output per hour of labour input. Higherproduction rates (output per hour) are achieved with automation than with the correspondingmanual operations. 2. High cost of labour: The trend in the industrialized societies of the world has beentoward ever-increasing labour costs. As a result, higher investment in automated equipment hasbecome economically justifiable to replace manual operations. The high cost of labour is forcingbusiness leaders to substitute machines for human labour. Because machines can produce athigher rates of output, the use of automation results in a lower cost per unit of product. 3. Labour shortages: In many advanced nations there has been a general shortage oflabour. Labour shortages stimulate the development of automation as a substitute for labour. 4. Trend of labour toward the service sector: This trend has been especially prevalentin India. There are also social and institutional forces that are responsible for the trend. Therehas been a tendency for people to view factory work as tedious, demeaning, and dirty. This viewhas caused them to seek employment in the service sector of the economy government, insurance,personal services, legal, sales, etc. Hence, the proportion of the work force employed inmanufacturing is reducing. 5. Safety: By automating the operation and transferring the operator from an active participationto a supervisory role, work is made safer. 6. High cost of raw materials: The high cost of raw materials in manufacturing resultsin the need for greater efficiency in using these materials. The reduction of scrap is one of thebenefits of automation. 7. Improved product quality: Automated operations not only produce parts at faster ratesbut they produce parts with greater consistency and conformity to quality specifications. 8. Reduced manufacturing lead time: With reduced manufacturing lead time automationallows the manufacturer a competitive advantage in promoting good customer service. AUTOMATION !# 9. Reduction of in-process inventory: Holding large inventories of work-in-processrepresents a significant cost to the manufacturer because it ties up capital. In-process inventoryis of no value. It serves none of the purposes of raw materials stock or finished productinventory. Automation tends to accomplish this goal by reducing the time a workpart spends inthe factory. 10. High cost of not automating: A significant competitive advantage is gained by automatinga manufacturing plant. The benefits of automation show up in intangible and unexpected ways,such as, improved quality, higher sales, better labour relations, and better company image. All of these factors act together to make production automation a feasible and attractivealternative to manual methods of manufacture. 10.5 ADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATIONFollowing are some of the advantages of automation: 1. Automation is the key to the shorter workweek. Automation will allow the average number of working hours per week to continue to decline, thereby allowing greater leisure hours and a higher quality life. 2. Automation brings safer working conditions for the worker. Since there is less direct physical participation by the worker in the production process, there is less chance of personal injury to the worker. 3. Automated production results in lower prices and better products. It has been estimated that the cost to machine one unit of product by conventional general-purpose machine tools requiring human operators may be 100 times the cost of manufacturing the same unit using automated mass-production techniques. The electronics industry offers many examples of improvements in manufacturing technology that have significantly reduced costs while increasing product value (e.g., colour TV sets, stereo equipment, calculators, and computers). 4. The growth of the automation industry will itself provide employment opportunities. This has been especially true in the computer industry, as the companies in this industry have grown (IBM, Digital Equipment Corp., Honeywell, etc.), new jobs have been created. These new jobs include not only workers directly employed by these companies, but also computer programmers, systems engineers, and other needed to use and operate the computers. 5. Automation is the only means of increasing standard of living. Only through productivity increases brought about by new automated methods of production, it is possible to advance standard of living. Granting wage increases without a commensurate increase in productivity will results in inflation. To afford a better society, it is a must to increase productivity. 10.6 DISADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATIONFollowing are some of the disadvantages of automation: 1. Automation will result in the subjugation of the human being by a machine. Automation tends to transfer the skill required to perform work from human operators to machines. !$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT In so doing, it reduces the need for skilled labour. The manual work left by automation requires lower skill levels and tends to involve rather menial tasks (e.g., loading and unloading workpart, changing tools, removing chips, etc.). In this sense, automation tends to downgrade factory work. 2. There will be a reduction in the labour force, with resulting unemployment. It is logical to argue that the immediate effect of automation will be to reduce the need for human labour, thus displacing workers. 3. Automation will reduce purchasing power. As machines replace workers and these workers join the unemployment ranks, they will not receive the wages necessary to buy the products brought by automation. Markets will become saturated with products that people cannot afford to purchase. Inventories will grow. Production will stop. Unemployment will reach epidemic proportions and the result will be a massive economic depression. 10.7 AUTOMATION STRATEGIESThere are certain fundamental strategies that can be employed to improve productivity inmanufacturing operations technology. These are referred as automation strategies. 1. Specialization of operations: The first strategy involves the use of special purposeequipment designed to perform one operation with the greatest possible efficiency. This isanalogous to the concept of labour specializations, which has been employed to improve labourproductivity. 2. Combined operations: Production occurs as a sequence of operations. Complex partsmay require dozens, or even hundreds, of processing steps. The strategy of combined operationsinvolves reducing the number of distinct production machines or workstations through which thepart must be routed. This is accomplished by performing more than one operation at a givenmachine, thereby reducing the number of separate machines needed. Since each machine typicallyinvolves a setup, setup time can be saved as a consequence of this strategy. Material handlingeffort and nonoperation time are also reduced. 3. Simultaneous operations: A logical extension of the combined operations strategy is toperform at the same time the operations that are combined at one workstation. In effect, twoor more processing (or assembly) operations are being performed simultaneously on the sameworkpart, thus reducing total processing time. 4. Integration of operations: Another strategy is to link several workstations into a singleintegrated mechanism using automated work handling devices to transfer parts between stations.In effect, this reduces the number of separate machines though which the product must bescheduled. With more than one workstation, several parts can be processed simultaneously,thereby increasing the overall output of the system. 5. Increased flexibility: This strategy attempts to achieve maximum utilisation of equipmentfor job shop and medium volume situations by using the same equipment for a variety of products.It involves the use of the flexible automation concepts. Prime objectives are to reduce setup timeand programming time for the production machine. This normally translates into lower manufacturinglead time and lower work-in-process. AUTOMATION !% 6. Improved material handling and storage systems: A great opportunity for reducingnon-productive time exists in the use of automated material handling and storage systems. Typicalbenefits included reduced work-in-process and shorter manufacturing lead times. 7. On-line inspection: Inspection for quality of work is traditionally performed after theprocess. This means that any poor quality product has already been produced by the time it isinspected. Incorporating inspection into the manufacturing process permits corrections to theprocess as product is being made. This reduces scrap and brings the overall quality of productcloser to the nominal specifications intended by the designer. 8. Process control and optimization: This includes a wide range of control schemesintended to operate the individual process and associated equipment more efficiency. By thisstrategy, the individual process times can be reduced and product quality improved. 9. Plant operations control: Whereas the previous strategy was concerned with thecontrol of the individual manufacturing process, this strategy is concerned with control at the plantlevel of computer networking within the factory. 10. Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM): Taking the previous strategy one stepfurther, the integration of factory operations with engineering design and many of the otherbusiness functions of the firm. CIM involves extensive use of computer applications, computerdata bases, and computer networking in the company. 10.8 AUTOMATED FLOW LINESAn automated flow line consists of several machines or workstations which are linked togetherby work handling devices that transfer parts between the stations. The transfer of work partsoccurs automatically and the workstations carry out their specialized functions automatically. Theflow line can be symbolized as shown in Fig. 10.2. A raw workpart enters one end of the lineand the processing steps are performed sequentially as the part moves from one station to thenext. It is possible to incorporate buffer zones into the flow line, either at a single location orbetween every workstation. It is also possible to include inspection stations in the line toautomatically perform intermediate checks on the quality of the workparts. Manual stations mightalso be located along the flow line to perform certain operations which are difficult or uneconomicalto automate. Raw PROC AUTO-Automated Processing Stations Finished Work part in part out Station 1 Station 2 Station 3 Station 4 Station 5 Fig. 10.2 Configuration of an automated flow line Automated flow lines are generally the most appropriate means of productions in cases ofrelatively stable product life; high product demand, which requires high rates of production; andwhere the alternative method of manufacture would invoice large labour content. !&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT The objectives of the use of flow line automation are: 1. To reduce labour costs; 2. To increase production rates; 3. To reduce work-in-process; 4. To minimize distances moved between operations; 5. To achieve specialization of operations; and 6. To achieve integration of operations. There are two general forms that the workflow can take. These two configurations are in-line and rotary.In-line TypeThe in-line configuration consists of a sequence of workstations in a more-or-less straight linearrangement. The flow of work can take a few 90° turns, either for workpiece reorientation,factory layout limitations, or other reasons, and still qualify as a straight-line configuration. Acommon pattern of workflow, for example, is a rectangular shape, which would allow the sameoperator to load the starting workpiece and unload the finished workpiece.Rotary TypeIn the rotary configuration, the workparts are indexed around a circular table or dial. Theworkstations are stationary and usually located around the outside periphery of the dial. The partsride on the rotating table and are registered or positioned, in turn, at each station for its processingor assembly operation. This type of equipment is often referred to as an indexing machine or dialindex machine and the configurations. The choice between the two types of configurations depends on the application. The rotarytype is commonly limited to smaller workpieces and to fewer stations. There is no flexibility inthe design of the rotary configuration. The rotary configuration usually involves a lower-costpiece of equipment and typically requires less factory floor space. The in-line design is preferablefor larger work pieces and can accommodate a larger number of workstations. In-line machinescan be fabricated with a built-in storage capability to smooth out the effect of work stoppagesat individual stations and other irregularities. 10.9 AUTOMATED GUIDED VEHICLES SYSTEMSAn automated or automatic guided vehicle system (AGVS) is a materials handling system thatuses independently operated, self-propelled vehicles that are guided along defined pathways in thefloor. The vehicles are powered by means of on-board batteries that allow operation for severalhours (8 to 16 hours is typical) between recharging. The definition of the pathways is generallyaccomplished using wires embedded in the floor or reflective paint on the floor surface. Guidanceis achieved by sensors on the vehicles that can follow the guide wires or paint. AUTOMATION !10.9.1 Types of AGVSThe types of Automated Guided Vehicles Systems (AGVS) can be classified as follows: 1. Driverless trains: The type consists of a towing vehicle (which is the AGV) that pullsone or more trailers to form a train. It was the first type of AGVS to be introduced and is stillpopular. It is useful in applications where heavy payloads must be moved large distances inwarehouses of factories with intermediate pickup and drop-off points along the route. 2. AGVS pallet trucks: Automated guided pallet trucks are used to move palletized loadsalong predetermined routes. In the typical application the vehicle is backed into the loaded palletby a human worker who steers the truck and uses its forks to elevate the load slightly. Then theworker who steers the truck to the guide path, programs its destination, and the vehicle proceedsautomatically to the destination for unloading. A more recent introduction related to the pallettruck is the forklift AGV. This vehicle can achieve significant vertical movement of its forksreach loads on shelves. 3. AGVS unit load carriers: This type of AGVS is used to move unit loads from onestation to another station. They are often equipped for automatic loading and unloading by meansof powered rollers, moving belts, mechanized lift platforms, or other devices. The light-load AGVis a relatively small vehicle with a corresponding light load capacity. It does not require the samelarge aisle width as the conventional AGV. Light-load guided vehicles are designed to move smallloads through plants of limited size engaged in light manufacturing. The assembly line AGVS isdesigned to carry a partially completed subassembly through a sequence of assembly workstationsto build the product. AGVS technology is far from mature, and the industry, and the industry is continuallyworking to develop new systems in response to new application requirements. An example of anew and evolving AGVS design involves the placement of a robotic manipulator on an automatedguided vehicle to provide a mobile robot for performing complex handling tasks at variouslocations in a plant.10.9.2 Applications of Automated Guided Vehicle SystemsAutomated guided vehicle systems are used in a growing number and variety of applications. Itsapplications can be categorised into the following types: 1. Driverless train operations: These applications involve the movement of large quantitiesof materials over relatively large distances. For example, the moves are within a large warehouseor factory building, or between buildings in a large storage depot. For the movement of trainsconsisting of 5 to 10 trailers, this becomes an efficient handling method. 2. Storage/Distribution systems: Unit load carries and pallet trucks are typically used inthese applications. These storage and distribution operations involve the movement of materialsin unit loads (sometimes individual items are moved) from or to specific locations. The applicationsoften interface the AGVS with some other automated handling or storage system, such as anautomated storage/retrieval system (AS/RS) in a distribution centre. The AGVS delivers incomingitems of unit loads from the receiving dock to the AS/RS, which places the items in storage, andthe AS/RS retrieves individual pallet loads or items form storage and transfer them to vehicles &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTfor delivery to the shipping dock. When the rates of incoming loads and the outgoing loads arein balance, this mode of operation permits loads to be carried in both directions by the AGVSvehicles, thereby increasing the handling system efficiency. 3. Assembly line operations: AGV systems are being used in a growing number ofassembly-line applications. In these applications, the production rate is relatively low and thereare a variety of different models made on the production line. Between the workstations, componentsare kitted and placed on the vehicle for the assembly operations that are to be performed on thepartially completed product at the next station. The workstations are generally arranged in parallelconfigurations to add to the flexibility of the line. Unit load carries and light-load guided vehiclesare the type of AGVS used in these assembly lines. 4. Flexible manufacturing systems: Another application of AGVS technology is in flexiblemanufacturing systems (FMS). In this application, the guided vehicles are used as the materialshandling system in the FMS. The vehicles deliver work from the staging area (where work isplaced on pallet fixtures, usually manually) to the individual workstations in the system. Thevehicles also move work between stations in the manufacturing system. At a workstation, thework is transferred from the vehicle platform into the work area of the station for processing.At the completion of processing by that station a vehicle returns to pick up the work and transportit to the next area. AGV systems provide a versatile material handling system to complement theflexibility of the FMS operation. Example: Using roborts and automation together, manufacturing is carried out without usingmanpower (unmanned) from raw material to finished products. 5. Miscellaneous applications: Other applications of automated guided vehicle systemsinclude non-manufacturing and non-warehousing applications, such as, mail delivery in officebuildings and hospital material handling operations. Hospital guided vehicles transport meal trays,linen, medical and laboratory supplies, and other materials between various departments in thebuilding. These applications typically require movement of the vehicles between different floorsof the hospital and will use elevators for this purpose. 10.10 AUTOMATED STORAGE/RETRIEVAL SYSTEMSAn automated storage/retrieval system (AS/RS) is defined by the Materials Handling Institute as,“A combination of equipment and controls which handles, stores and retrieves materials withprecision, accuracy and speed under a defined degree of automation”. AS/R systems are custom-planned for each individual application, and they range incomplexity from relatively small mechanized systems that are controlled manually to very largecomputer-controlled systems that are fully integrated with factory and warehouse operations. The AS/RS consists of a series of storage aisles that are serviced by one or more storage/retrieval (S/R) machines, usually one S/R machine per aisle. The aisles have storage racks forholding the materials to be stored. The S/R machines are used to deliver materials to the storageracks and to retrieve materials from the racks. The AS/RS has one or more input stations wherematerials are delivered for entry into storage and where materials are picked up from the system.The input/output stations are often referred to as pickup and deposit (P&amp;D) stations in theterminology of AS/RS systems. The P&amp;D stations can be manually operated or interfaced tosome form of automated handling system, such as a conveyor system or AGVS. AUTOMATION&quot;10.10.1 Types of AS/RSSeveral important categories of automated storage/retrieval systems can be distinguished. Theseinclude: 1. Unit load AS/RS: This is typically a large automated system designed to handle unitloads stored on pallets or other standard containers. The system is computer-controlled and theS/R machines are automated and designed to handle the unit load containers. The unit loadsystem is the generic AS/RS. 2. Miniload AS/RS: This storage system is used to handle small loads (individual parts orsupplies) that are contained in bins or drawers within the storage system. The S/R machine isdesigned to retrieve the bin and deliver it to a P&amp;D station at the end of the aisle so that theindividual items can be withdrawn from the bins. The bin or drawer is then returned to its locationin the system. The miniload AS/RS system is generally smaller than the unit load AS/RS and isoften enclosed for security of the items stored. 3. Man-on-board AS/RS: The man-on-board AS/RS system represents an alternativeapproach to the problem of storing and retrieving individual items in the system. Whereas theminiload system delivers the entire bin to the end-of aisle pick station, the man-on-board systempermits the individual items to be picked directly at their storage locations. This offers anopportunity to reduce the transaction time of the system. 4. Automated item retrieval system: These systems are also designed for retrieval ofindividual items or small unit loads such as cases of product in a distribution warehouse. In thissystem, the items are stored in single-file lanes rather than in bins or drawer. When an item isto be retrieved, it is released from its lane onto a conveyor for delivery to the pickup station. Thesupply of items in each lane is generally replenished from the rear of the retrieval system, so thatthere is flow-through of the items, thus permitting first in first out (FIFO) inventory control. 5. Deep-lane AS/RS: The deep-lane AS/RS is a high density unit load storage system thatis appropriate when large quantities are to be stored but the number of separate types of materialis relatively small. Instead of storing each unit load so that it can be accessed directly from the aisle,the deep-lane system stores up to 10 or so loads in a single rack, one load behind the next. Eachrack is designed for ‘flow-through’ with input on one side and output on the other side. Loadsare picked from one side of the rack system by a special S/R type machine designed for retrievaland another special machine is used on the entry side of the rack system for input of loads.10.10.2 Basic Components of an AS/RSAll automated storage/retrieval systems consist of certain basic building blocks. These componentsare: l Storage structure l Storage/retrieval (S/R) machine l Storage modules (e.g., pallets for unit loads) l Pickup and deposit stations. &quot;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT 1. The storage structure is the fabricated steel framework that supports the loads contained in the AS/RS. The structure must possess sufficient strength and rigidity that it does not deflect significantly due to the loads in storage or other forces on the framework. The individual storage components in the structure must be designed so to accept and hold the storage modules used to contain the stored materials. 2. The S/R machine (sometimes called a crane) is used to accomplish a storage transaction, delivering loads from the input station into storage, or retrieving loads from storage and delivering them to the output station. To perform these transactions, the storage/retrieval machine must be capable of horizontal and vertical travel to align its carriage with the storage compartment in the storage structure, and it must also pull the load from or push the load into the storage compartment. 3. The storage modules are the containers of the stored material. Examples of storage modules include pallets, steel wire baskets and containers, tote pans, storage bins, and special drawers (used in miniload AS/RS systems). These modules are generally made to a standard base size that can be handled automatically by the carriage shuttle of the S/R machine. 4. The pickup and deposit stations are used to transfer loads to and from the AS/RS. They are generally located at the end of the aisles for access by the S/R machine and the external handling system that brings loads to the AS/RS and takes loads away. The pickup stations and deposit stations may be located at opposite ends of the storage aisle or combined at the same location. This depends on the origination point of the incoming loads and the destination of the output loads. The P&amp;D stations must be designed so that they are compatible with the S/R machine shuttle and the external handling system. 10.11 CAROUSEL STORAGE SYSTEMSA carousel storage system is series of bins or baskets fastened to carries that are connectedtogether and revolve around a long, oval track system. The track system is similar to a trolleyconveyor system. Its purpose is to position bins at a load/unload station at the end of the oval.The operation is similar to the powered overhead rack system used by dry cleaners to deliverfinished garments to the front of the store. The typical operation of the storage carousel ismechanized rather than automated. The load/unload station is manned by a human worker whoactivates the powered carousel to deliver a desired bin to the station. One or more parts areremoved from the bin, and the cycle is repeated. Carousels come in a variety of sizes, ranging between 10 and 100 ft in length of the oval.As the length of the carousel is increased, the storage density increases, but the averagetransaction time (Storage or retrieval) decreases. Accordingly, the typical carousel size rangesperhaps between 30 and 50 ft to achieve a proper balance between these opposing factors. 10.12 CAROUSEL STORAGE APPLICATIONSThe carousel storage system provides for a relatively high throughout rate and is often anattractive to the miniload AS/RS in the following types of applications: AUTOMATION&quot;! 1. Storage and retrieval operations: In certain operations individual items must be selectedfrom the group of item stored in the bin or basket. Sometimes called ‘pick and load’ operations,this type of procedure is common for order picking of service parts or other items in wholesalefirm, tools in a toolroom, raw materials from a stockroom, and work-in-process in a factory. Insmall assembly operations such as electronics, carousels are used to accomplish kitting of partsthat will be transported to the assembly workstations. 2. Transport and accumulation: These are applications in which the carousel is used totransport and sort materials as they are stored. One example of this is in progressive assemblyoperations where the workstations are located around the periphery of a continuously movingcarousel and the workers have access to the individual storage bins of the carousel. They removework from the bins to complete their own respective assembly tasks, and then place their workinto another bin for the next operation at some other workstation. 3. Unique applications: These involve specialised uses of carousel storage systems.Examples include electrical testing of components, where the carousel is used to store the itemduring testing for a specified period of time; and drawer or cabinet storage, in which standarddrawer-type cabinets are mounted on the carousel. Storage carousels are finding an increasing number of applications in manufacturing operations,where it’s relatively low cost, versatility, and high reliability have been acknowledged. It representsa competitive to the miniload AS/RS and other AS/RS configurations for work-in-progress storagein manufacturing plant. EXERCISESSection A 1. What do you mean by automation? 2.

BRUEGGER’S BAGEL BAKERY Bruegger’s Bagel Bakery makes and sells a variety of bagels, including plain, onion, poppyseed, and cinnamon raisin, as well as assorted flavors of cream cheese. Bagels are the majorsource of revenue for the company. The bagel business is a Rs.3 billion industry. Bagels are very popular with consumers. Notonly are they relatively low in fat, they are filling, and they taste good! Investors like the bagelindustries because it can be highly profitable: it only costs about Rs.10 to make a bagel, and theycan be sold for Rs.50 each or more. Although some bagel companies have done poorly in recentyears, due mainly to poor management, Bruegger’s business is booming; It is number one nationally, with over 450 shops that sell bagels, coffee, and bagel sandwichesfor takeout or on premise consumption. Many stores in the Bruegger’s chain generate an averageof Rs.800, 000 in sales annually. Production of bagels is done in batches, according to flavor, with each flavor being producedon a daily basis. Production of bagels at Bruegger’s begins at a processing plant, where the basicingredients of flour, water, yeast, and flavorings are combined in a special mixing machine. Afterthe dough has been thoroughly mixed, it is transferred to another machine that shapes the doughinto individual bagels. Once the bagels have been formed, they are loaded onto refrigerated trucksfor shipping to individual stores. When the bagels reach a store, they are unloaded from the trucksand temporarily stored while they rise. The final two steps of processing involve boiling the bagelsin a kettle of water and malt for one minute, and then baking the bagels in an oven forproximately 15 minutes. The process is depicted in Figure 1. Quality is an important feature of a successful business. Customers judge the quality ofbagels by their appearance (size, shape, and shine), taste, and consistency. Customers are alsosensitive to the service they receive when they make their purchases. Bruegger’s devotes carefulattention to quality at every stage of operation, from choosing suppliers of ingredients, carefulmonitoring of ingredients, and keeping equipment in good operating condition to monitoring outputat each step in the process. At the stores, employees are instructed to watch for deformed bagelsand to remove them when they find them. (Deformed bagels are returned to the main plantwhere they are sliced into bagel chips, packaged, and then taken back to the stores for sale,thereby reducing the scrap rate.) Employees who work in the stores are carefully chosen andthen trained so that they are competent to operate the necessary equipment in the stores and toprovide the desired level of service to customers. AUTOMATION&quot;# The company operates with minimal inventories of raw materials and inventories of partiallycompleted bagels at the plant and very little inventory of bagels at the stores. One reason forthis is to maintain a high degree of freshness in the final product by continually supplying freshproduct to the stores. A second reason is to keep costs down; minimal inventories mean lessspace is needed for storage.Questions 1. Bruegger’s maintains relatively little inventory at either its plants or its retail stores. List the benefits and risks of this policy. 2. Quality is very important to Bruegger’s. (a) What features of bagels do customers look at to judge their quality of bagels? (b) At what points in the production process do workers check bagel quality? (c) List the steps in the production process, beginning with purchasing ingredients, and ending with the sale, and state how quality can be positively affected at each step. 3. Which inventory models could be used for ordering the ingredients for bagels? Which model do you think would be most appropriate for deciding how many bagels to make in a given batch? 4. Bruegger’s has bagel-making machines at its plants. Another possibility would be to have a bagel-making machine at each store, what advantages does each alternative have?

So exports surge, long-moribund industries glow with new foundprofits, and unemployment dips to lows not seen in a decade. But in the smokestack citadels,there’s disquiet. Too many machine tool and auto parts factories are silent; too many U.S.industries still can’t hold their own. What went wrong since the heyday of the 1960s? That’s the issue Max Holland, a contributingeditor of The Nation, takes up in his nutsy-boltsy but fascinating study, When the MachineStopped. (Max Holland, When the Machine Stopped: A Contemporary Tale from industrialAmerica (Boston, Mass: Harvard Business School Press, 1988) The focus of the story is Burg master Corp., a Los Angeles-area machine tool makerfounded in 1944 by Czechoslovakian immigrant Fred Burg. Holland’s father worked there for 29years, and the author interviewed 22 former employees. His shop-floor view of this smallcompany is a refreshing change from academic treatises on why America can’t compete. The discussion of spindles and numerical control can be tough going. But Holland compensatesby conveying the pany’s early days and the disgust and cynicism accompanying its decline.Moreover, the fate of Burgmaster and its brethren is crucial to the U.S. industrial economy: Anymanufactured item is either made by a machine tool. Producing innovative turret drills used in a wide variety of metalworking tasks, Burgmasterwas a thriving enterprise by 1965, when annual sales amounted to about Rs. 8 million. Thecompany needed backing to expand, however, so it sold out to Buffalo-based conglomerateHoudaille Industries Inc. Houdaille was in turn purchased in a 1979 leveraged buyout led by &quot;$ PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTKhlberg Kravis Roberts&amp;Co. By 1982, when debt, competition, and a sickly machine-toolmarket had battered Burgmaster badly, Houdaille went to Washington with a petition to withholdthe investment tax credit for certain Japanese-made machine tools. Thanks to deft lobbying, the Senate passed a resolution supporting Houdaille’s position, butPresident Regan refused to go along. Houdaille’s subsequent attempt to link Burgmaster up witha Japanese rival also failed, and Burgmaster was closed. Holland uses Burgmaster’s demise to explore some key issue of economic and trade policy.Houdaille’s charge that a cartel led by the Japanese government had injured U.S. toolmakers, forexample, became a rallying point for those who would blame a fearsome Japan Inc. for theproblems of U.S. industry. Holland describes the Washington wrangling over Houdaille in painful detail. But he doesshow that such government decisions are often made without much knowledge of what’s goingon in industry. He shows, too that Japanese producers succeeded less because of governmenthelp than because of government helps than because they made better, cheaper machines. For those who see LBOs as a symptom of what ails the U.S. economy, Holland offersplenty of ammunition. He argues persuasively that the LBO CRIPPLED Burgmaster by creatingenormous pressure to generate cash. As Burgmaster pushed its products out as fast aspossible, he writes, it routinely shipped defective machines. It promised customers features thatengineers hadn’t yet designed. And although KKR disputes the claim, Holland concludes thatthe LBO choked off Burgmaster’s investment funds just when foreign competition made themmost necessary. As for Houdaille, it was recapitalized and sold to Britain’s Tube InvestmentsGroup. But Burgmaster’s problems had started even before the LBO. Holland’s history of thecompany under Houdaille is a veritable catalog of modern management techniques that flopped.One of the most disastrous was a system for computerizing production scheduling that was toocrude for complex machine-tool manufacturing. Holland gives a dramatic depiction of supplysnafus that resulted in delays and cost increases. As an independent company, “Burgmaster thrived because the Burgs knew their business,”Holland writes. Their departure under Houdaille was followed by an “endless and ultimately futilesearch for a better formula!’ But he concludes: “No formula was a substitute for managementinvolvement on the shop floor!’ In the end, however, Holland puts most of the blame for the industry’s decline on governmentpolicy. He targets tax laws and macroeconomic policies tbat encourage LBOs and speculationinstead of productive investment. He also criticizes Pentagon procurement policies for favoringexotic, custom machines over standard, low-cost models. This adds up to an industrial policy,Holland writes-a bad one. The point is well taken, but Holland gives it excessive weight. Like their brethren in Detroitand Pittsburgh, domestic tool-makers in the 1970s were too complacent when imports seized thelower end of the product line. The conservatism that had for years served them in their cyclicalindustry left them ill-prepared for change. Even now some of the largest U.S. toolmakers arestruggling to restructure. Blame the government, yes. But blame the industry, too. AUTOMATION&quot;%Questions 1. Write a brief report that outlines the reasons (both internal and external) for Burgmaster’s demise, and whether operations management played a significant role in the demise.

HOME-STYLE COOKIESThe Company The Lew-Mark Baking Company is located in a small town in western New York State.The bakery is run by two brothers. Lew and Mark, who formed the company after theypurchased an Archway Cookie franchise. With exclusive rights in New York and New Jersey,it is the largest Archway franchise. The company employs fewer than 200 people, mainly blue-collar workers, and the atmosphere is informal.The Product The company’s only product is soft cookies, of which it makes over 50 varieties. Largercompanies, such as Nabisco, Sunshine, and Keebler, have traditionally produced biscuit cookies,in which most of the water has been baked out, resulting in crisp cookies. Archway cookies haveno additives or preservatives. The high quality of the cookies has enabled the company to developa strong market niche for its product.The Customers The cookies are sold in convenience stores and supermarkets throughout New York andNew Jersey. Archway markets its cookies as “good food” no additives or preservatives and thisappeals to a health-conscious segment of the market. Many customers are over 45 years of age,and prefer a cookie that is soft and not too sweet. Parents with young children also buy thecookies.The Production Process The company has two continuous band ovens that it uses to bake the cookies. The productionprocess is called a batch processing system. It begins as soon as management gets orders fromdistributors. These orders are used to schedule production. At the start of each shift, a list of thecookies to be made that day is delivered to the person in charge of mixing. That person checksa master list, which indicates the ingredients needed for each type of cookie, and enters thatinformation into the computer. The computer then determines the amount of each ingredientneeded, according to the quantity of cookies ordered, and relays that information to storage siloslocated outside the plant where the main ingredients (flour, sugar, and cake flour) are stored. Theingredients are automatically sent to giant mixing machines where the ingredients are combinedwith proper amounts of eggs, water, and flavorings. After the ingredients have been mixed, thebatter is poured into a cutting machine where it is cut into individual cookies. The cookies arethen dropped onto a conveyor belt and transported through one of two ovens. Filled cookies, suchas apple, date, and raspberry, require an additional step for filling and folding. The nonfilled cookies are cut on a diagonal rather than round. The diagonal-cut cookiesrequire less space than straight-cut cookies, and the result is a higher level of productivity. In &quot;&amp;PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTaddition, the company recently increased the length of each oven by 25 feet, which also increasedthe rate of production. As the cookies emerge from the ovens, they are fed onto spiral cooling racks 20 feet highand 3 feet wide. As the cookies come off the cooling racks, workers place the cookies into boxesmanually, removing any broken or deformed cookies in the process. The boxes are then wrapped,sealed, and labeled automatically.Inventory Most cookies are loaded immediately onto trucks and shipped to distributors. A smallpercentage is stored temporarily in the company’s warehouse, but they must be shipped shortlybecause of their limited shelf life. Other inventory includes individual cookie boxes, shippingboxes, labels, and cellophane for wrapping. Labels are reordered frequently, in small batches,because FDA label requirements are subject to change, and the company does not want to getstuck with labels it can’t use. The bulk silos are refilled two or three times a week, dependingon how quickly supplies are used. Cookies are baked in a sequence that minimizes downtime for cleaning. For instance, light-colored cookies (e.g., chocolate chip) are baked before dark-colored cookies (e.g., fudge), andoatmeal cookies are baked before oatmeal raisin cookies. This permits the company to avoidhaving to clean the processing equipment every time a different type of cookie is produced.Quality The bakery prides itself on the quality of its cookies. A quality control inspector samplescookies randomly as they come off the line to assure that their taste and consistency aresatisfactory, and that they have been baked to the proper degree. Also, workers on the line areresponsible for removing defective cookies when they spot them. The company has also installedan X-ray machine on the line that can detect small bits of metal filings that may have gotten intocookies during the production process. The use of automatic equipment for transporting rawmaterials and mixing batter has made it easier to maintain a sterile process.Scrap The bakery is run very efficiently and has minimal amounts of scrap. For example, if abatch is mixed improperly, it is sold for dog food. Broken cookies are used in the oatmealcookies. These practices reduce the cost of ingredients and save on waste disposal costs. Thecompany also uses heat reclamation: The heat that escapes from the two ovens is capturedand used to boil the water that supplies the heat to the building. Also, the use of automationin the mixing process has resulted in a reduction in waste compared with the manual methodsused previously.New Products Ideas for new products come from customers, employees, and observations of competitors’products. New ideas are first examined to determine whether the cookies can be made withexisting equipment. If so, a sample run is made to determine the cost and time requirements. Ifthe results are satisfactory, marketing tests are conducted to see if there is a demand for theproduct. AUTOMATION&quot;Potential Improvements There are a number of areas of potential improvement at the bakery. One possibility wouldbe automate packing the cookies into boxes. Although labour costs are not high, automating theprocess might save some money and increase efficiency. So far, the owners have resistedmaking this change because they feel an obligation to the community to employ the 30 womenwho now do the boxing manually. Another possible improvement would be to use suppliers whoare located closer to the plant. That would reduce delivery lead times and transportation costs,but the owners are not convinced that local suppliers could provide the same good quality. Otheropportunities have been proposed in recent years, but the owner rejected them because theyfeared that the quality of the product might suffer.Questions 1. Briefly describe the cookie production process. 2. What are two ways that the company has increased productivity? Why did increasing the length of the ovens result in a faster output? 3. Do you think that the company is making the right decision by not automating the packing of cookies? Explain your reasoning. What obligation does a company have to its employees in a situation such as this? What obligation does it have to the community? Is the size of the town a factor? Would it make a difference if the company was located in a large city? Is the size of the company a factor? What if it was a much larger company? 4. What factors cause Lew-mark to carry minimal amounts of certain inventories? What benefits results from this policy? 5. As a consumer, what things do you consider in judging the quality of cookies you buy in a supermarket? 6. What advantages and what limitations stem from Lew-Mark’s not using preservatives in cookies? 7.
