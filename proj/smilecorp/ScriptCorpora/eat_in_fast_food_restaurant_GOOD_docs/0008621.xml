What Do You Do When Someone Backs Into Your Car And Then Won’t Give The Insurance Agent A Statement?
 Posted on January 7, 2011 by admin 
Two weeks ago, a young man backed into my car at a fast food restaurant while I was waiting in the drive-thru. He gave me his insurance information and I called that day and spoke with a claims adjuster. She has tried to contact him by phone and by mail and he refuses to return her calls to give a statement. She will not authorize payment for my car until she gets in touch with him. Short of notifying my insurance to make a claim what can I do to get him to call his agent and give a statement?

A lesson to be learned: if ever you are involved in an accident that is someone else’s fault, always get the police involved. That way, everything will be on record and you will be able to receive compensation for damages through insurance. Since the police was not involved in your accident, the young man may unfortunately get away with it. You may opt to try to take the man through the legal system, but it is a time consuming and expensive process to do so.

Go through your own company (providing the loss exceeds your deductible amount). The bozo will likely listen when your company’s legal staff contact him for subrogation.

All insurance companies have a COOPERATION clause in the policy. NO insurance will pay out on a claim until they have spoken with their insured. If the guy fails to cooperate coverage can be denied. You would be off going thru your insurance at this point and they will pursue the other carrier on your behalf.

He is scared that it will raise his premiums or that his parents will find out. You will have to call your insurance company which is in the future the first thing that you should do.

Nothing, and you shouldn’t be talking to his insurance anyway. Contact your insurance and let them collect for you, as you should have done in the first place.

Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to force the person to give his carrier a statement. The BEST and most sucessful recourse for you–is to file a claim with your carrier (if you are NOT at fault, they WILL NOT surcharge you for this accident or any accident you are NOT at fault for) and they will pay for your damages and then subrogate the other carrier. At that point the other carrier has to respond–with or without their insured’s statement.
