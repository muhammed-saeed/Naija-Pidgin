 Sunday 
 January 31, 2010 [Oh 
 for Petes sake] Sorry maam, I was only trying to point out AOL has caused 
 innumerous problems for its users over the decades. The main one - charging 
 a lot of money for lousy slip-shod service just for advertising. Please, do 
 not be offended. I sincerely meant it when I said ask for a little help 
 understanding the basics of internet communications. It can be tricky and a 
 little frustrating. I meant no disrespect. Obviously you are an elderly 
 woman using an expression like for Petes sake. I am not so young myself, 
 I went back to school in the late 90s to learn all this PC voodoo and to 
 this day, I still remain constantly amazed. This has sure been a cold winter so far. Usually we have a cold front for a few days then eight degree 
 weather for a few more before the next cold spell. Not this year! 

[ Batteries ] Take apart a four dollar 6 volt lantern battery and 
 youll get 32 standard AA batteries. watch this video and see how easy it is 
 to do. Video 
 [ Change ] I have talked this over with many people in 
 the Keys and we ask, no we demand, the following changes to CT. 

 We want 3 separate sections.
1 for pertinent topics, both local and international
2 for totally useless and incoherent gibberish
3 a section for woman [ Fair 
 and Balanced ] Fox is the most trusted television news network in the 
 country, according to a new poll out Tuesday.

A Public Policy Polling nationwide survey of 1,151 registered voters Jan. 
 18-19 found that 49 percent of Americans trusted Fox News, 10 percentage 
 points more than any other network.

Thirty-seven percent said they didnt trust Fox, also the lowest level of 
 distrust that any of the networks recorded. 
 Our President was amazing when he debated the Republicans a couple of 
 days ago. He is brilliant. He answered all of their questions with facts 
 and common sense. He conducted himself with calm dignity. It&apos;s about time 
 that he put the Republicans in their place. We are so lucky to have such a 
 smart President in this time in our history. Hopefully the Republicans will 
 be able to think for themselves when casting votes in the future, instead of 
 acting as obstructionists. If you take any 41 people and ask them a 
 question, there will never be an answer that everyone agrees on. Yet, all of 
 the US Senators (and Congressmen) continually agree on everything and cast a 
 no vote as a block. Let&apos;s see, do you think this could possible be 
 political? Ha! What a bunch of Bozos. Even the Democrats don&apos;t always 
 agree. The Blue Dog Democrats vote their own minds. This is what our 
 elected officials are supposed to do. The voters elect them to vote their 
 minds. The Republicans have let America down by playing a political game 
 and obstructing America&apos;s ability to move forward in our ever changing 
 society.  Police 
 scoured the hills outside rural Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after reports of 
 three animal rights activists going missing after attempting to protest the 
 wearing of leather at a large motorcycle gang rally this weekend. Two 
 others, previously reported missing, were discovered by fast food workers 
 duct taped inside several fast food restaurant dumpsters, according to 
 police official. 
 Fridays post castigating Obama for thanking his wife 
 twice was the most petty criticism of Obama Ive seen since his being 
 criticized for reading from a teleprompter. Divided we stand is the 
 appropriate slogan for our times. 
 
 Annie 
 McWey passed away this week. Annie might 
 best be remembered for her time working as a bartender at The Top of 
 the La Concha Hotel in the late 70s . She was there in Key Wests 
 heyday and knew all the players. 

 A 
 remembrance will be held today at 2 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 31, at the 
 Shanna Key Pub, 1900 Flagler Ave. 
 [Gay 
 adoption] Raise a kid in a candy store and theres a high probability 
 he will be fat. Someone used 
 this argument yesterday to point out that its unnatural for two daddies or 
 mommies to raise a hetero kid. Maybe. Maybe not. My parents raised me 
 surrounded by utter left wing bs. Ive totally 
 rejected it and they are ashamed of my politics. Good. We should all be more 
 honest about who we really are.    
 Fundraiser

 ATT 
 DSL cost the same as Comcast. Its the ATT wireless that is $70 a month. Regular ATT DSL is only about twenty 
 bucks. 
 [ Corporations 
 have same rights as people ] Senators and congressmen will wear jackets 
 bearing their sponsors logos. That should have been made mandatory long 
 ago. Now at least the company can compete with the union, which has blown 
 my dues in ways I don&apos;t approve for way too long. 
 
Choose one: (A) Parenting , not for everybody. (B) More bleach in the 
 gene pool. 
 All truth passes through three stages. First it is 
 ridiculed. Second it is violently opposed and third it is accepted as 
 self-evident. ~Authur C. Clarke 
[ Euthanizing raccoons ] Ill bet they try and pin this on the IKC [ China ] 
 Wouldn&apos;t it suck if they decided to call in their 800 billion dollar note to 
 us! China suspends military exchanges 
 with US 
 


[ Gays in the military ] If you are so deep in the closet that you 
 found next year&apos;s Christmas presents, why don&apos;t you and Tom Cruise just 
 admit it and get on with your lives. The Bill and Melinda Gates 
 Foundation will 
 donate $10 billion over the next decade to research new vaccines and bring 
 them to the world&apos;s poorest countries. Tire 
 prices are nuts. Have you priced tires recently? What used to be $29.95 
 installed is now half your home mortgage! Jus think how many hours you will 
 have to work to get the money to pay for these.

 [ On the Road ] From the Right guys on the road 
 reporting is refreshing and a pleasure to read. I didnt think he breathed 
 any other subject besides hating his Mr Obama. [ Teleprompter ] 
 Our sick society now demands that presidents be actors who must remember all 
 their lines for each performance. We even get upset if a politician reads 
 from notes. 
 [ No Name Electric ] When I bought in the Keys I was 
 told No Name Key would not get utilities and I wouldnt have to pay for them 
 (not really). 

Against gays in the military . No Edit Saturday really brings out the 
 intolerant douches. The iPad&apos;s touch-screen keyboard . http://scitech.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/29/demo-touch-keyboard-on-the-ipad/

 Mark Twain Friday night I saw one of those tiny smart cars resting on it&apos;s head with its wheels up in the air and 
 it appeared to be all in one piece. This was on Big Pine across from Reef 
 Light Tackle. [ Don&apos;t 
 Believe It ] Weighing in at over 245 pounds and standing 
 over 43 inches tall , 
 meet George, the tallest and largest dog in the world.

 &quot;In my 45 years of experience 
 working with giant breed dogs, without question, George is the tallest and 
 largest dog I have ever seen.&quot;    [ Sloan ] I was advised by County 
 Commissioner Heather Carruthers that Waste Management single streams by 
 colleting recyclables that have been separated from garbage by county 
 residents. The recyclables are sent to WMs recovery plant, the garbage is 
 sent to WMs disposing facility. Heather said she is going to see WMs 
 facility on the mainland soon. 

 Another Keys amiga and good Repubilcan amigo 
 Todd German told me the separation facility is interesting. The recyclables 
 are dumped onto a big conveyor belt, and as the belt moves air blown from 
 below, magnets hanging above, and other methods are used to separate out and 
 collect fabrics, paper, plastic, metal, etc. Todd also said, about the 
 garbage, that WMs burn facility is more of a come on, to get WM business. 
 Most of the garbage, he said, WM takes to a land fill. 
 
 Everyone I have spoken with about 
 stream recycling says it hinges on residents separating the recyclables from 
 their garbage: food, used tampons, used diapers, etc. If residents dont do 
 this separation, there is no recycling; it all goes to WMs burn facility or 
 landfill. 
 
 Many (most, I wager) Keys residents 
 dont separate their waste. WM doesnt provide separation bins in Key West, 
 and didnt provide them for Little Torch Key when I lived there in 2006, 
 and, as far as I know, still doesnt provide them, as the person living in 
 my trailer on Little Torch Key doesnt have WM separation bins. 

 We all should be recycling, whether we 
 want to or not. Therefore, I remain of the view that waste separation by 
 Keys residents should be mandatory, and there should be a method of 
 enforcement that has serious teeth. Teeth for residents, teeth for Waste 
 Management.   More ... goodmorningfloridakeys.com 
 




Parenting is not for everyone. NASA satellite photos from 
 space. This is a real nice presentation. http://www.greatdanepro.com/Blue%20Bueaty/index.htm 
 I 
 find it amazing how uninformed the average American is and they dont 
 want to be informed. Someone wrote suggested watching LINK TV to get another 
 opinion of the rest of the world and was vilified for the very notion of 
 learning about others. 
 [ Copper plumbing corrodes] I feel for that homeowner 
 whose house is rotting. Many people paid extra to have their houses plumed 
 in copper not knowing that it corrodes in the Keys. The much cheaper PVC 
 piping last forever if you keep it out of the sun. 

Point, counter-point! Targeted sds . 
 If No Name Key wants utilities they should have to put 
 the total costs plus traditional cost overruns into an escrow account in 
 advance. If a utility says it will cost $600,000 to install utilities you 
 can rest assured that by the time they are done it will cost $700,000. this 
 is fact. No big job comes in within the budget. Why should us other 
 taxpayers have to pay for their utilities?

Make sure they put the cost overrun into the escrow account so the rest of 
 us don&apos;t get screwed when the final cost is totaled. 
 Clean coal? Every ton of clean coal burned produces 2.5 tons 
 of liquid CO2 as a by-product. So thats not the answer unless someone can 
 figure out what to do with all that CO2. One problem might be solved, but 
 another, larger one is created. 
 [ Frugal ] 
 I lost a large portion of my income recently and have stopped buying. I was 
 buying stuff online almost every day. Its been almost a month since I 
 stopped and I really dont miss anything that I would have purchased. I 
 hadnt realized how wasteful Id been. Its been an eye opener for me. 
 [ Actually overused] Well was the most popular word 
 that was used to begin most sentences a couple of years ago. Then there was 
 absolutely which permeated most sentences. This year the most popular word 
 in any sentence is actually. No one goes to the store any more; they 
 actually go to the store. Ill not mention the over use of the word like 
 by kids because they dont have much of a vocabulary yet. 
 Recently 
 I let Microsoft send me another update and on restart (must restart 
 for changes to take effect or we&apos;ll nag you until you do) got the ol&apos; Blue 
 Screen Of Death (sigh). With all the different programs made by all the 
 different people they can&apos;t possibly all get along all the time. Consider 
 it another learning experience, sort it out and push on. 
 The tallest 
 structure (includes signal towers, too) Its opening last week. Burj Dubai 
 Arabic for Dubai Tower is over a half mile high 2,684 feet. 
If you&apos;re up well before sunrise on Saturday or Sunday, here&apos;s the 
 scene in the west. 
 [ What&apos;s that 
 beep ] Being educated doesn&apos;t mean you are smart. To my non pilot 
 friends, the klaxon going off in this video is a warning to the pilots that 
 the aircraft is in the landing configuration and the gear is not down and 
 locked. These two pilots are having a wonderful social conversation instead 
 of doing the pre-landing checklist. 

 The ending is a 
 good look and sound of what a gear-up landing sounds like. 

 Being able to 
 ignore that loud warning is amazing. The fact that someone was in the back 
 seat with video and audio recording equipment running recording this 
 magnificent performance of cockpit stupidity makes this a rare video indeed. Video Pandora is my favorite music station on the internet. There&apos;s no registration or 
 sign in unless you&apos;d like to save your music shows. Just type in the artist 
 or type of music you like. That&apos;s all.
I bought a $60 surround sound speaker set, plugged it in and started 
 listening to the full sound. It&apos;s great. http://www.pandora.com/ 
 [ From 
 the Right ] Its late and we just returned to the rock, its good to be 
 home. A quick read of todays (Saturdays) CT revealed some postings that 
 were quite interesting and quite well written. It is shame that the one 
 pertaining to the IPCC and its Chair was riddled with factual errors. If 
 youre interested in the evil machinations of Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the UNs Intergovernmental 
 Panel on Climate Change you will find that Pachauri, like Al Gore, has 
 become wealthy peddling the notion of AGW. You will learn that he was well 
 aware of the astounding errors in the report that falsely alleged the 
 immanent melting of Himalayan glaciers long before the Copenhagen summit. 
 You will learn that he only grudgingly admitted error after being hounded 
 and challenged by the media. There is sufficient information concerning Pachauri to cast strong doubt on 
 his credibility, and vastly more important, the credibility of his 
 scientific claims. The issue of AGW most certainly is not settled 
 science.  As to ACORN and the posters claim that it is a righteous 
 organization. If you are nave and have any notion that ACORN is indeed 
 righteous, please take just a moment and run a search on the search term: 
 acorn voter fraud convictions. You will find many arrests, etc. We are all 
 big boys and girls; we can all make up our own minds. The piece pertaining 
 to the recent Supreme Court decision on campaign financing was well written, 
 and it is obvious that the submitter sees the decision as radical. Further, 
 it seems obvious that he/she is immersed in the mantra of the left. That 
 mantra in this instance is his/her opinion, not fact. FTR holds a contrary 
 view. In my view, the decision is radical only in that it substantially 
 remedies some of the 40 years of usurpation of freedom of speech, that 
 usurpation imposed by our political class to ensure their own job 
 protection. The decision re-sets the cornerstone of The First Amendment to 
 our Constitution: our government simply cannot be permitted to decide what 
 constitutes an appropriate amount of political speech. 

 As 
 to the issue of Mr. Obamas status as a silly SOB. I was wrong; he did not 
 use two Teleprompters when speaking with 6 th grade crumb 
 crunchers. I apologize. Only late yesterday did I learn the actual facts. Again, I apologize for my error of fact.  Nonetheless, I feel that his 
 status as a silly SOB is enhanced by the fact that he finds its necessary 
 to use two teleprompters when meeting with 11 fawning reporters in a 6 th grade school room. I suppose that the Secret Service dude was there to throw 
 himself in front of Mr. Obama in the unlikely event that a reporter tossed a 
 tough question at him.

 (eD: No edIT SatuRDAY!!!!!!......b-cuz u

 No-Edit Saturday. For those of you visiting for the first time, dont judge 
 the Coconut Telegraph by todays un-edited episode. This is the Editor&apos;s day 
 off. Tune it tomorrow for the 
 edited version. Youll find its&apos; format and graphics more pleasing. 
 What have John Roberts and his activist 
 cohorts gone and done to our system of government? I remember Mr. 
 Roberts confirmation hearings, wherein he promised a respect for 
 precedent and a modest approach to jurisprudence. That was then. Now, 
 he invites parties to argue 
 whether previous Supreme Court decisions , 
 not to mention more than 100 years of election 
 law , should be overturned in order to allow corporations to have 
 free speech during elections. 

 When the First Amendment was crafted in 
 1791, there were approximately 150 corporations in the United States , 
 all chartered by state legislatures , and 
 thereby owing their allegiance to the government. The Constitutions 
 framers had no intention of giving these corporations the same rights as 
 human citizens. 

 Reading Justice Kennedys opinion, it is not even clear that foreign 
 corporations could be prohibited from participating in American 
 elections. Todays big corporations have no allegiance to the United 
 States. They only care about profit. As a stock owner, I have no 
 problem with that, but I do have a problem with these corporations being 
 given the power to attack any candidate that a corporation perceives as standing in the way of them making more 
 profits. 

 Abraham Lincoln, our 
 first Republican president, warned us about this when he wrote, As a result of the war, 
 corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places 
 will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong 
 its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth 
 is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed. The 
 corruption came, but the Republic was not destroyed because laws were 
 passed to control corporate money in the election process. 

 Now those laws are gone, by a vote of 5 to 4. Under the Roberts Court, 
 certainly the most activist five judges in my lifetime, the concept of stare decisis is history and I 
 fear that soon, Lincolns nightmare will become reality. One wonders 
 whether senators and congressmen will wear jackets bearing their 
 sponsors logos, or simply mount plaques on their office walls. No 
 Edit Saturday caption the GIF OPEN HOMOSEXUALS IN MILITARY----it is time to be open and a homo in the 
 military.That way soldiers will know who NOT to cover in a firefight.Try 
 this a little while and the homo&apos;s will be happy go back in the military 
 closet. Can you imagine life and death camping(what war is) and having to 
 regret the shower scene(men or women) or wondering if a homo will cover you 
 in a firefight (especially if you rejected IT).And they shouldnt be allowed 
 to adopt children either and push their unnatural morals on a influential 
 child! Think about it . You raise a kid in a candy store and theres a high 
 probablity he will be fat. homos go do your thing ,but do it with other 
 unwanted weirdos. I understand President Obama is being compared to President Jimmy 
 Carter.I do remember President Carter very well. Long lines to get fuel 
 for your car and 17 to 20 % interest rates.That was when I went into 
 business here on Pine Key.I needed to get loans for well over 150M 
 dollars,yes I remember those interest rates. Over 100 Americans were 
 held hostage for many months,President Carter was a new fresh faced 
 outsider,with no real world experience,not unlike President Obama. I 
 didn&apos;t vote for our President , I was hoping for more.More of everything 
 that we are not getting. I just don&apos;t see how anyone could be upbeat 
 about where we are heading as a people and a country.We need a change. A 
 change you can believe in...and live with. God Bless America The 
 Florida Keys Dragon Boat Club is looking for a steersman , someone to steer

 [Sloan] I told an amiga yesterday that maybe I&apos;ve been going so hard at the 
 Republicans lately to draw as much attention as possible to the way 
 they behaved when David Rice ran against Ron Saunders in 2006. 
 Maybe they will be reluctant to behave in that way again again. 
 Maybe hearing of Republican George Neugent&apos;s views of how they 
 behaved in 2006 also will influence them. I leave what I wrote 
 yesterday, and what George wrote back, for readers to dissect, or 
 not. Despite George&apos;s description of my insanity, dimentia and lies, 
 which view is shared by many people, I suppose, I still think he did 
 a very good job leading the County Commission and the county 
 government to around after the 2008 elections. I still do not want 
 to run against him this year. I doubt I could do anywhere near as 
 good a job as he has done. I  do not want the job. I don&apos;t have the 
 personality (patience) for it. And my health is not up to it.

 What if we tried to

 ugly poles over the bridge and into the ground how about a wind turbine 
 out there. With all the towers in the Keys, there must be a way to 
 combine enough turbines to create enough electricity for the 40 some odd 
 houses out there. I look forward to some input on this idea. 

 What about the issue 
 of the County government wanting to try for a 4 th time to 
 convict Ms. Carter for her downstairs enclosure. As a taxpayer I am not 
 impressed with them wanting to retry the case with my tax money. Sure up

 - Victor Borge AT&amp;T $70.00 not true (no brainer). Florida keys Satellite has DIRECTV Bundle 
 with AT&amp;T starting at $50.00 tax not included. That&apos;s over 150 channels plus 
 local channels and DSL light, for only $50.00. Now that&apos;s a no brainer! This 
 is a vampire bat
 
 There have been 
 several articles in the South Florida newspapers lately about the 
 invasive and deadly vampire bat. There are many bat varieties 
 worldwide, but you usually find the true vampire bats only in 
 Central and South Americauntil now. They are small, agile fliers 
 that land on their sleeping victims, mostly deer, large dogs and 
 humans, to lap a blood meal after biting their victim. Most victims never 
 feel a thing and the bite itself is superficial. But increasingly 
 bats are targeting humans and the encounters are turning deadly. Vampire bats 
 don&apos;t suck the victims blood; they make a small hole with their two 
 very sharp incisor teeth and lap up the blood. Their saliva contains 
 an anticoagulant that keeps the blood slowly flowing while they feed 
 off their victim. A percentage of these bats carry rabies. Rabies is a 
 frightening and deadly disease. The classic form of the disease 
 turns even docile creatures into aggressors that foam at the mouth. 
 But the strain found in vampire bats is different. It is known as 
 paralytic or dumb rabies causing disorientation, muscle weakness and 
 eventually death. 

 If you observe a 
 Key Deer foaming at the mouth you are encouraged to contact the 
 Refuge Center. You probably havent had much luck contacting them 
 24/7 to respond to an injured deer but they do occasionally listen 
 to their answering machine. If you come in contact with a 
 disorientated intoxicated female foaming at the mouth you should 
 avoid contact with her at all costs. Eating thoroughly 
 cooked bats presents no danger from rabies and other diseases but 
 again, the emphasis is on thorough cooking. Lunatics Anonymous is 
 researching the idea of commercially raising vampire bats as an 
 alternative food source as the current supply of fresh Iguana meat 
 is limited, thanks to the Iguana killers club. 
 Our wildlife agents, the same ones who are euthanizing any racoons they

  http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/   What do you think? So the Himalayan glaciers won&apos;t melt by 2035 
 after all? Why don&apos;t I feel better?    It reminds me of when ACORN was beling 
 lambasted by the wingnuts because some of their employees had behaved 
 improperly when registering voters, thereby causing the removal of some 
 ficticious names from the rolls. I&apos;ve yet to see a wingnut give credit 
 to ACORN for stepping up and doing what it was legally mandated to do, 
 namely policing itself. To this day I still hear the endless bleating 
 from the right about ACORN and&quot;massive voter fraud&quot;, as if repeating 
 this mantra enough times will somehow make it real. ACORN did 
 have problems with some voter registrations, but I&apos;m still waiting for 
 anyone to identify a single fraudulently cast vote in any election that 
 ACORN has been inolved with.   The IPPC found fault with some of their data 
 and have corrected it. That&apos;s what legitimate scientists do when this 
 occurs. Everyone should know that no outside agency or entity uncovered 
 and revealed this flawed data, it was the IPPC itself! Yet the right 
 wing squirmers immediately jump on this and claim it invalidates the 
 entire body of scientific eveidence for global warming. No it doesn&apos;t.  Despite the continued hyperventilations of 
 FTR, the findings of the IPPC do not stem from the personal efforts 
 of R. K. Pachauri. The IPPC shared the Nobel Prize with Al Gore because 
 of the weight and credibility of it&apos;s efforts, which gathered and 
 analyzed data presented by scores of degreed professionals who study our 
 global climate and the endless linkages that affect our lives.  Trying 
 to discredit the man&apos;s illustrious educational and professional 
 background becuause&quot;he&apos;s not a climatologist&quot;is silly, and if we 
 follow that kind of logic I ask you again why you hold up an architect 
 as the source of sound advice on this matter.  Pachauri&apos;s professional 
 background in this field spans nearly 3 decades and cannot be ignored. In November 2009, Pachauri was rated fifth in the list of&quot;Top 100 
 Global thinkers&quot;by Foreign Policy magazine, for&quot;ending the debate over whether 
 climate change matters&quot;. I encourage all readers to research Pachauri&apos;s 
 career and accomplishments (you&apos;ll find he&apos;s hardly a dilettante) and to 
 actually review the IPPC report before before forming any conclusions 
 about global warming and what it means.   Yes FTR, the mainstream scientific community 
 has weighed in on global warming and any serious debate has ended...all 
 that remains is the pointless shouting of those in denial. Hold your 
 breath and stamp your feet all you want...we&apos;ve seen that act before. RE;    the big pine key is the largest flea

 major conflict there.   The self righteous Democratic party campaigned hard for&amp;convinced Alabama voters to elect extreme segregationist George

 Regular CT readers may recall that 
 about 2 weeks ago an astute reader denied the existence of any 
 penguin population outside of Antarctica. That reader actually had 
 the temerity to deny the existence of the Arctic Brass Penguin. So, 
 in the interest of seeking the truth we embarked on an expedition to 
 the wilds of the west. Our rational being that high mountains, 
 limited population, and very cold conditions would be an attractive 
 habitat for migrating Brass Penguins. We did find certain anecdotal 
 evidence from the indigenous population near Tucson that at least 
 one small colony of Brass Penguins, all geldings, had been observed 
 in the Mountains north of Tucson. We hypothesize that this remnant 
 population fled the Arctic to avoid the ravages of predation at the 
 hands (feet?) of the expanding population of the Arctic Polar Bear. 
 Our research disclosed the existence of yet another colony of Brass 
 Penguins in the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet. These mountains are 
 blessed with vast glaciations. Recently it has been reported that 
 the Himalayan glaciations were at risk due to global warming. 
 Recently, in a scandalous development, those reports have been 
 proven false. Maliciously false! The Tibetan glaciers are not at 
 any immediate risk. In a stunning development an esteemed 
 colleagues wolf like appetite for the truth has discovered 
 documentary proof of the existence of the Himalayan Brass Penguin. 
 Additionally he has found proof of the existence of the legendary 
 Himalayan Yeti, aka The Abominable Snow Man. The issue is now 
 settled science; it is out of the reach of the deniers. See for

 The 
 reason Africa is underdeveloped is a fascinating question 
 answered by Jared Diamond in his book Guns Germs and Steel which discusses in some depth the reasons for human development around 
 the world. Diamond, a UCLA professor suggests combinations of 
 agriculture and availability of other resources including minerals and 
 water helped certain cultures develop further and faster than others.

Of course if you are hunkered down on Big Pine Key blinking and trying 
 to figure out where your life went you might find it easier to blame&quot;welfare&quot;for Africa&apos;s poverty. Just because you are American no one 
 said you have to use your brain or learn to think for yourself. 
 What a great 
 surprise last Saturday night. A brand new local band called Voodu Sol was advertised in the paper to be playing at Rob&apos;s. I haven&apos;t been 
 to Rob&apos;s in years, but out of curiosity I went to check out this new 
 band. They were awesome! This very high energy group rocked the house 
 with everything from rock to blues even Santana and Sublime. I sure hope 
 they play again soon. Be on the lookout for more showings of Voodu Sol. 
 You have to hear this band, they rock. 

 I hope Robs

 the Perennial Candidate ] Last night I attended a town hall meeting 
 at Harvey Government Center in Key West, hosted by County Commissioner 
 Heather Carruthers. I ran against Heather, a Democrat, in 2008, as an 
 Independent. Also in the race was Carlos Rojos, who started out the race 
 on the Democrat ticket, then switched over to the Republican ticket and 
 defeated incumbent Charles Sonny McCoy in the Republican primary. As 
 usual, I came in dead last, nobody else came in close to second to dead 
 last.
 
I counted just under 30 citizens at the meeting last night, which was 
 disappointing, but the meeting itself was anything but disappointing. I 
 wont go into any of the details, other than to say when, toward the 
 end, Heather asked if we had any suggestions for how the County 
 Commission might change how it runs meetings, I said I hoped the 
 Commission would continue to grow and improve, building on the good 
 that started with the 2008 election.
 
Outside afterwards, I spoke with activist Diane Bureldsen. I said this 
 county commission is really an improvement over the last one, and I 
 felt the sane way about the Key West City Commission after the 2009 
 election, in which I ran for mayor and again won the booby prize without 
 any competition at all from the other three candidates, one of whom was 
 Morgan McPherson, about whom I wrote in yesterdays Following Orders 
 post.
 
I told Dianne that I was having trouble finding anything to fault County 
 Commissioner George Neugent and it would be very hard fo rme to run 
 against him again. I ran against George in 2006, when I lived on Little

 shift, when George and I began to have sharp disagreements over the

[ No Name Electric ] Keys Energy Service is working on bringing 
 power to No Name Key and they are still having a meeting of the minds. 
 To the lady 
 who thinks the IKC is some kind of joke , guess what? It is not. I 
 have seen these demons in action. Did you see the movie they posted the 
 other day? We SIN(?) members have been following them for some time and 
 we are making a documentary to send to PETA (but right now PETA is busy 
 working on saving the groundhogs). We have one tape of the IKC planning 
 to make a profit out of the slaughter. There they were, about ten of 
 them, men (and women!!) sitting around a campfire. They were 
 swilling kegs of beer and roasting dead Iguanas like smores over the 
 fire. The leader was laughing and talking about making wallets, belts, 
 bandanas, key chains and earrings out of the hides. The smell was 
 hideous and the iguanas didn&apos;t smell very good either. The whole scene 
 was barbaric. We were going to wait until they passed out and riddle 
 the pickup trucks with yellow paint balls, but we had to leave because 
 of the disgusting sight; although we did let the air out of tires on one 
 of their trucks. We will have to remain low key for the time because we 
 are scared of the IKC. Some of them remind us of movie Deliverance . 
 We read on the IKC website they are having a rally or some kind of 
 mullet head gathering the day before Valentines. What are they planning; 
 some kind of iguana massacre or ritual? Be forewarned head IKC lizard 
 licker, one of us has already been to the website and has gotten a 
 membership and there will be more infiltration. 

 SIN is going 
 to have its own rally soon; were still seeking a sponsor. We are 
 kicking around the idea of transforming Fort Zachary Taylor beach into 
 the Un-Indigenous Keys Park, where the iguanas can roam freely among the 
 Australian Pines and possibly relocate some of the bunnies from Boca 
 Chica and some Key Deer. Maybe we can call it SIN City?

 [ IKC Event] Valentines Day is only a couple of weeks away and this is just a 
 reminder of the upcoming IKCs1 st annual family fun filled 
 event the Iguana Killers Tournament . Admittance is free to all 
 comers and each person that attends will be given a free raffle ticket. 
 The rifle prize is an IKC41 high power rifle signed by Sarah Palin. 
 Numerous hunting suppliers have already committed to this great event. 

 The Miss 
 Iguana beauty pageant will be held in the enclosed main tent and persons 
 under the age of 18 will not be permitted inside. We should have seating 
 for app. 375 persons. Photographs and video will be prohibited of the 
 beauty pageant and this will be strictly enforced. 

 The weigh-in 
 station will be located to the left of the main tent. This centrally 
 located weigh station will be the only one for the entire Florida Keys. 
 The weigh station will be open from 6:30pm to 8:00pm. Iguanas must be 
 presented to the weigh master, fresh, dead, and free of mutilations by 
 the hunter that did the take down. The decision of the weigh master will 
 be final. Iguanas that have been spike clubbed will be disqualified. 

 All hunters 
 must sign the official entry form and agree to take a polygraph test to 
 make sure that the kill complied with the IKC rules of engagement. The 
 only rule change to date is that Iguanas that have been frozen to death 
 to end their suffering from the rifle shot wound will be eligible for 
 entry. 

 As this is a 
 fun family event alcoholic beverages will not be sold. This does not 
 prohibit attendees from bringing their own favorite beverage on the 
 site. Whereas whiskey seems to be the favorite beverage of devoted 
 hunters the Jack Daniels distillery will have a representative there 
 handing out promotional samples. 

 We have a 
 total of almost 40 venders already signed up. We will have 12 
 interactive classes on skinning and cooking your kill. There will be 
 rifle safety classes for all ages. Numerous food vendors and continuous 
 live entertainment. Demonstrations of live Iguana take downs. The IKC 
 will also be doing classes on how to handle yourself if find yourself 
 being swallowed by a Burmese python. 

 To the left of 
 the main tent will be a live display of numerous large pythons, rattle 
 snakes, Key Deer, Gambian rats and numerous varieties of Iguanas. 
 Interactive participation with the audience will be a lifetime 
 experience on how to handle these creations. 

 Make this a family event and come out and meet a bunch of 
 the great folks from Lunatics anonymous. We are still taking donations 
 to offset the cost of the 1 hour fireworks display which will start 
 promptly at 8pm. You could be the lucky winner of the signed IKC41

 The inorganic planet Earth has a patina of organic matter. The cue ball 
 on the pool at the Moose lodge has a thicker layer of organic matter, 
 proportionally, than the planet earth. This organic matter includes 
 viruses, bacteria, hockers, and other things transferred from the hands 
 of the players. From the highest mountain top to the deepest trench in 
 the ocean is about 10 miles. Divide that into the diameter of the earth 
 and that number times 100 represents the percentage of life. Do the same 
 thing for the cue ball and include the natural roughness of the ball and 
 youll find life is thicker proportionally on the cue ball. 

 Do you suppose that the bacteria on the cue ball pray to 
 Mother Ball? The life on the cue ball or the earth doesnt make it 
 organic. Rock isnt alive. Im going to study voting on the way to my 
 college teaching job. 
 
 [ Gitmo ] I have an idea. Load them all into a big transport plane 
 and drop them all off at about 10,000 feet over their prospective 
 countries. Allah ought to be looking out for them so I figure the 
 innocent ones will bounce and run home and the guilty ones, well I guess 
 they get to go see their 27 virgins. 
 


[ Debt ] How come when the Republicans do deficit spending it&apos;s 
 okay, but when the Dems do it, it&apos;s the Original Sin? The Republicans 
 have done it also when in power. 
 [ No Name electric ] Life and things change. One of 
 the great things about life and things changing is that as we learn we 
 can make changes, we can make corrections, we can make things better.

Now that we&apos;ve all learned that No Name Key is not green, we can and we 
 will correct that and make it better.

 [ Healthcare] I recently read an open letter in a magazine for physicians. In summary, 
 it argues for a rational approach to health care with the patient 
 sharing responsibility for his health. It&apos;s so good I have to pass it 
 on. 

 Healthcare is a responsibility, not a right. Healthcare is the 
 responsibility of the patient, not the state or the physician. Health 
 care is diet, exercise, temperance, no smoking, no doping, safe driving, 
 safe sex, wanted progeny, and clean living. 

 Reform is the responsibility of the patient. Reform is ending 
 unnecessary diseases caused by bar room brawls, addictions, unwanted 
 pregnancy, obesity, accidents and violence. 

 I diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. I strive for constant, 
 never-ending improvement, not reform, debate, duplicity, rationing, 
 denials, and crisis. I am a medical doctor, physician and surgeon, not a 
 health care giver, caretaker, or provider. No one can provide anyone 
 with health, fitness, sobriety, peace, clarity, clear conscience, 
 meaningful work and restful sleep. 

 Politics thrives on transposing rights an responsibilities, health and 
 disease, givers and takers, high taxes and come-hither giveaways, 
 citizens and non-citizens, physicians and staff, cost and quality, 
 productivity and pen-pushing, privacy and Internet records. Politics 
 thrives on crisis and conflict among patients, insurance, families and 
 physicians. 

 Make insurance portable. Allow preexisting conditions. Provide 
 socialized medicine for those who reach the maximum lifetime insurance 
 benefit. 
 [ Easily 
 led ] I&apos;ve long enjoyed watching right-wingers squirm and I&apos;m 
 not alone. It&apos;s very entertaining sport as evidenced by the popularity 
 of such master squirmers as Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity, and now, Paul 
 Shirley.  While providing some fascinating insight into human nature, 
 they also offer a sad commentary on just how shallow, indifferent, and 
 easily-led we truly are.    

 From the right guy has been throwing off some palpable 
 heat lately, or should I say hate? Bush and all he stood for became 
 anathema to the American people, yet FTR defends him like he was a 
 righteous man. He was and remains a villain that brought more ruin to 
 this nation than a thousand Bin Ladens. Obama reads from a 
 teleprompter. How pathetic the contrast. 

 I suggest that FTR find a good veterinarian as it seems 
 his favorite ox is dying from a thousand Gores. 
 
The Big Pine Key Flea Market will be held tomorrow and Sunday. This 
 is the largest flea Market in the lower Keys. Walk around and you will

 Obama gave a speech that was 
 over an hour long and found the time to thank his wife twice. The shame 
 was that he failed to thank the Ft Hood heroes who were sitting right 
 next to her, yet he wonders why America has lost respect for him. 
 [ What&apos;s in 
 a name ] I&apos;ve had worse meals at Denny&apos;s.
 
 [ From the 
 Right ] At the very instant that you are reading this an industrial 
 engineer named Dr. R.K. Pachauri is the Chairman, of the uber powerful 
 U,N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations., 
 aka IPCC. The findings of the IPCC are taken as dicta in the dizzy 
 world of true believers of A nthropological G lobal W arming. 
 One of the most important pillars of their castle of crap is a years old 
 report that the glaciers of the Himalayas were melting like Dairy Queen 
 in August.. Gasp, Groan, they told us that the damned things would 
 disappear by 2035 thereby wreaking havoc on millions. It has just been 
 revealed that the whole story is just crap. The report is an utter, 
 total falsehood. Incredibly the falsehood that Pachauri was peddling was 
 based on a poorly crafted newspaper article dating to 1999. Pachauri is 
 not a climatologist, but is one of the most highly respected experts 
 in the AGW crowd. No 
 one in the world exercised more influence on the events leading up to 
 the Copenhagen conference on global warming than Dr Rajendra Pachauri, 
 chairman of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
 and mastermind of its latest report in 2007. Although Dr Pachauri is 
 often presented as a scientist (he was even once described by the BBC as 
 the worlds top climate scientist), as a former railway engineer with 
 a PhD in economics he has no qualifications in climate science at all. 
 Of note is the fact that like Al Gore, Pachuri has made a fortune from 
 global warming. In his role as Chair of IPCC, he could take steps to 
 sanction those who published the falsehood, but he declines. Go figure. http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/bios/pachauri..htm . 

 (Part IIon 
 the road) America is a wondrous place. For the last week or so weve 
 been on the road traveling through Arizona and now Nevada. Weve seen 
 snow and desert. In Flagstaff we were puzzled by seeing pickup truck 
 after pickup truck with their beds heaped with snow 3-4 deep. Then we 
 learned that they had had 56 of snow two days earlier. The Grand Canyon 
 is even more grand when the plain above is heaped with 2 feet of snow 
 and the canyon sides are dusted with white. Off season is absolutely the 
 best time to visit, only a few other tourists to trip over. The hotels 
 are cheap--dirt cheap. The restaurants are anxious to have customers, 
 and service is quick and very, very friendly. The roads are clear and 
 traffic is very light.  

 The drive from 
 Tucson to Vegas is jam packed with some of the most impressive scenery 
 that weve seen. Its no BPK, but itll do. Deserts, snow capped 
 mountains, yawning cliffs adjacent to the highway, and high plains 
 country mantled in knee deep snow made the drive really memorable. Weve 
 driven through dust storms and snow storms; it doesnt get much better 
 than that! The Hoover dam and the construction of a new bridge adjacent 
 to it is a real jaw dropper. Then theres Vegas. 

 If you like 
 crowds, glitz, shoulder to shoulder nattering tourists cramming the 
 sidewalks, and smoky casinos, then Vegas is the place for you. On the 
 other hand the Cirque du Soleil homage to the Beatles at the Mirage is 
 worth the trip itself. In this old farts misspent youth, I actually saw 
 the other side of the mountain, and one time I almost saw a naked lady, 
 but I never did see anything like this show. It is a balls-out techno 
 show with mind bending gee whiz effects, incredible choreography, and 
 stunning athleticism. If you even remotely enjoyed Beatles music, this 
 show is actually worth a trip to Vegas. Now that weve been there, done 
 that, and bought the t-shirt, its about time to get back to the Rock. 
 Im ready.

 [ Living 
 without air conditioning]  Weve lived here 30 years and never had 
 air conditioning. We built our house with this in mind and incorporated 
 features Id seen while traveling the world and noting how others in hot 
 climates designed their homes. 

 Some of the features we have are high ceilings, ten ceilings fans, very large windows in every place they would fit and 
 large overhangs on our porches to block the sun from reaching the walls 
 and windows. Serious insulation under the roof and in the walls is a 
 biggie. I was very inspired by the old homesteader&apos;s house museum on 
 Lignum Vitae Key (off Matecumbe Key). They really had their stuff 
 together. 

 Our electric bill in the simmer is $85 a month. We used the money we 
 saved on air condition (machinery, ductwork, electric and maintenance) 
 to pay off our mortgage. 
 [ Immigrant 
 Freebees ] The responder to Immigrants Treated Better then 
 Citizens listed several laws and statements and said that illegals 
 do not get the same benefits as US citizens. He also said in some cases 
 they may get emergency help or benefits for a limited time only. 

 This is 
 completely false. CA, AZ, NM, TX, states going broke because of illegals 
 collecting benefits the poster says they don&apos;t get, have all had those 
 laws overruled buy the Supreme Court. These states passed various laws 
 to restrict State administered Federal and State benefits to US Citizens 
 (excluding others) only to have been ruled unconstitutional on every 
 occasion by every Federal Court including the US Supreme Court. The 
 opinion of the court never changes. The court writes, &quot;The 
 Constitution does not differentiate between citizens and non-citizens 
 and speaks only to persons , therefore 
 eligibility can be denied or curtailed&quot; 

 Remember these 
 decisions when someone says that health care legislation will not cover 
 illegals. Illegals will be covered because the court only sees people not their immigration status. No matter what the bill says the courts 
 always will have the final say. 
 What 
 is up with the new traffic light pattern on Big Pine? Now 
 north-south traffic on US1 gets a long long, long green light while the 
 rest of us locals have to wait trying to turn from Key Deer Blvd! Who 
 can we call about changing it back? I have to turn north on US1 at the 
 light and sometimes have to wait 3 light cycles (5 minutes of sitting 
 there). It&apos;s usually quicker for me to turn right and then turn around 
 in the NAPA parking lot. I&apos;m angry! [ Solar cant run air conditioner] That is not true. The guy at 
 Long Hair Ranch on Big Pine runs his bedroom AC with solar stored in 
 batteries by means of a 220V inverter. Hes not on the grid either. Hes 
 been running his AC without grid-tie for years 
 [ Listening 
 While Driving Is Hard ] 
 A study finds that not only does talking interfere with driving skills, 
 the act of driving makes listening a much harder task. 

 We all know that talking on a cell phone can impair our 
 ability to drive (although too many of us do it anyway). Now a study in 
 the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review shows that the 
 reverse is also true: driving makes it hard to keep track of what were 
 talking about.
Previous studies had found that motorists are able to converse just 
 fine. But to Gary Dell of the University of Illinois that finding just 
 didnt make sense. Because comprehending speech requires attention, as 
 does steering the family sedan. So Dell did a study in a driving 
 simulator. 

 Ninety-six participants were paired up, with one taking 
 the wheel while the other sat in the passenger seat or talked to the 
 driver on a hands-free phone. Each participant listened to and was asked 
 to repeat a handful of stories, and then to remember them after getting 
 out of the car. As you can imagine, the drivers had a tougher time 
 recalling the details than the passengers. And their conversational 
 skills took the biggest nosedive while they were trying to navigate 
 intersections or handle traffic. 

 Next, maybe the scientists will determine whether driving 
 also impairs our ability to sing, eat breakfast, and put on makeup and, 
 of course, text. 
 [ Yahoo Problem ] Is anyone else having problems 
 sending email to people who use Yahoo as their ISP? All email is

 I have not seen Waste Managements stream recycling facility, and I 
 wonder if any Key West City official has? Its hard for me to imagine WM 
 workers dumping out and going through each plastic garbage bags 
 contents on a table of some kind and separating all of the 
 reusable fabric, tampons, rubbers, paper, plastic, glass, wood, metal, 
 etc. from the rotting food wastes. If WM says it happens, maybe it 
 happens, but Id hate to have that separation job. After the separation, 
 what does WM do with each category of garbage? Is it sent somewhere to 
 be reused? Is the rotting food composted and turned into fertilizer? Or 
 is it burned or sent to a landfill. I believe the Key West City 
 Commission, if it has not done so already, needs to send two of its 
 members up to Waste Managements stream recycling facility on a pop call 
 -- no announced arrival, to see what is really happening there. Then 
 they should report their findings to the rest of the commission and to 
 all of us. If, in fact, Waste Management is doing what it says its 
 doing, if it truly is recycling instead of burning and land-filling what 
 it carries out of the Keys to the mainland, then what do our local 
 recycle enthusiasts have to fret over? Paying extra for the service? 
 They will have to pay extra for it if it is done in Key West using 
 the 3-container method.   More ... goodmorningfloridakeys.com

 Sloan 
 B said More to the point, I see no way for we the people to live 
 in sync with Mother Nature while we rely on fossil fuels.    

 You started out well, Sloan, when you said,&quot;More to the 
 point&quot;, but then you immediately unravel.  Of course the way we use 
 fossil fuel wreaks havoc on the planet. That&apos;s stating the 
 obvious.  Your solutions? Hydrogen. Helium. Dark 
 matter. Anti-matter. Crystals? You forgot about magnetic bracelets and&quot;The Secret&quot;. Why not harness a few iguanas to a treadmill connected to

 is free software for everything ] Although the U.S. military 
 stateside can direct a drone aircraft halfway around the world to 
 deliver bombs mostly on highly specific targets in Iraq, the Pentagon 
 acknowledged in December that even after six years of war, its signals 
 to the drone are still not encrypted. Thus, Iraqi insurgents can 
 pinpoint drone locations merely by using ordinary computer programs like 
 SkyGrabber, which is widely available from software retailers for about 
 $25. U.S. officials admitted that the software could make it easier for 
 insurgents to anticipate the timing and location of attacks

 [ Frozen 
 to Death ] Immobilization of reptiles by cooling or freezing is 
 considered inappropriate and inhumane, even if combined with other 
 physical or chemical methods of euthanasia. Snakes, turtles, and other 
 reptiles, immobilized by cooling, have been killed by subsequent 
 freezing. This method is not recommended. Formation of ice crystals on 
 the skin and in tissues of an animal causes pain and distress. 

 I know these IKC posts are supposed to be someone&apos;s idea 
 of a joke, but there are people out there that do believe what you&apos;re 
 saying, just like the statement about freezing. Please don&apos;t act like 
 you&apos;re so concerned for the welfare of the Florida Keys&apos; environment. You are obviously some sick-o who likes to kill living things, so go 
 ahead, knock yourself out (literally, I wish). I do believe that there 
 is a higher power out there that you will ultimately have to answer to. Heck, if there is such a thing as reincarnation, I so hope that you 
 come back as an iguana! 

 We humans (those that are not a direct descendant to the 
 Indians that lived here) are not indigenous to the Keys either, and have 
 done more harm to the environment than the iguanas ever could, so please 
 find another subject to joke about. Maybe you can join the pro-electric 
 folk on No Name with more lying and hate-filled posts towards Ms. Putney 
 and those trying to protect the environment. You sound like you fit 
 right in with them.

 &apos;No good in a bed, but fine against a wall. ~Eleanor Roosevelt 
 [ Responsibility ] I am really getting tired of the 
 bleeding hearts who think the Earth is holy and people are perfect. Get 
 real folks. The lizards are eating everything, the cats are killing the 
 birds, the fish are dying off and the Snowbirds are trampling our 
 islands. Free housing for the less fortunate is also tearing us down to 
 their level just so someone can make a few bucks and feel good about 
 themselves. Enough already! It should be survival of the fittest not the 
 weakest.

 I&apos;m

 While you&apos;re at it, FTR, you might want to try again to 
 provide a definition of terrorism since your comments on terror leaves 
 one to wonder.  
 [ Africans ] What is hard to understand is why is 
 the huge African continent the lowest mean, per capita, income place on 
 the planet and why didn&apos;t the captured slaves escape back to it, regroup 
 and build a mighty nation with all Africas riches and vast land? The 
 answer is welfare! 
 [ No 
 Name Electric ] Letter from City Electric 
 stating that they are working with the County on the technical issues 
 and were pleased to provide electricity to No Name Key. 

 Id really be surprised if someone could produce a copy 
 of that letter here! Even if it existed City Electric is not the authoritative entity -- the 
 County is. Of course City Electric would be pleased to provide 
 electricity to No Name Key -- thats their business. 
 [ No Name Electric ] What a bunch of whiners. Green, not green, 
 CO2, on the grid pass the grits. My lawyer can beat your lawyer. 

 Sue whoever you must, but stop the bitching. Just sue - everybody does 
 it. When it&apos;s done many years from now, you win or lose. It will be 
 done. I hate to say it but it was a kinder, gentler island before you 
 all got here. You come down here to find the spot you always wanted and 
 you found it. Then you want to change it. So you go to court, sue the 
 pants off everyone to change the way it was. The way that it was that 
 you liked so much that you moved here. Please stop your silly bitching. 
 Most of you will be gone or dead way before this is settled. 
 [ No Name Electric ] I remember when people were coming to the area 
 and found the fishing village atmosphere of the Keys so charming that 
 they bought here. Then they went to court to change it and get rid of 
 the fisherman and lobster trap storage and trap construction to make it 
 more like they were used to back home. [ No Name Electric ] I live 
 on No Name Key and am doing my best to live without electricity. I 
 brush my teeth once a week. I only flush the toilet when it threatens 
 to overflow no matter what is in it (it might take a few days). I don&apos;t 
 shower since the sweating is like a free shower anyway. I gave up long 
 time ago hoping I could live like normal folk do. I can&apos;t afford to 
 dispose of my batteries when they go bad so I just heave them in the 
 canal. I hope one day I can get just a little electricity from the 
 power company so I can have a night light and stop stepping on my pet 
 turtles at night.

 E1MmY1YzA5Yzc1NGE = [ From the 
 Right ] Mr. Obamas State of the I Am (sic) address was a tour de force of self 
 aggrandizement. Its reported that spoke of himself a whopping 114 times. 
 Mr. Obama sure is a record breaker. Do you remember the good old days when 
 the State of the Union address was about our nation and its status? One of 
 the most interesting facets of his I Am address was his admonition that the 
 Republicans were at fault for the abject failure of his policies and 
 programs during the past year. Poor ole Mr. Obama portrays himself as a 
 victim to those nasty old Republicans. I marvel at how he and his are able 
 to ignore the fact that he has had an overwhelming majority in both the 
 House and the Senate.. Shoot, when he took office, he had nearly a 70% 
 approval rating. Mr. Obama did not need a single Republican vote to pass 
 any part of his agenda. His abysmal failures reside at his feet alone. His 
 fizzles are the result of his failure of leadership within his own party. 
 And, most especially, his failure to understand the heart and soul of 
 America. The true party of No is the party of Mr. Obama, Ms. Pelosi, and 
 Mr. Reid. That is the party that said No to Mr. Obama. And that is a 
 tribute to those Democrats who placed their love for our nation above party 
 loyalty by spiking so much of the Obama agenda. In all fairness, he did make 
 a couple of suggestions that make a great deal of sense. Not all Democrats 
 were impressed by the speech, Harry Reid, his Senate surrogate, yawned and 
 was having trouble staying awake. The speech was full of untruths and half 
 truths. For example he claimed that he had inherited an overwhelming debt 
 from Mr. Bush, and that under his watch the debt had increased, but in a 
 reasonable fashion. At the end of the 6 years that Mr. Bush had a Republican 
 Congress, the debt increased by about 2.8 trillion dollars. During that time 
 we had been forced to rebuild our military, we were fighting two wars, we 
 had been led out of a recession, and we had survived the Dot Com market 
 crash. In the subsequent 3 years of Democrat control of our purse strings, 
 until today, the debt had increased by about 2.9 trillion. The rate of 
 increase of debt has more doubled under Democrat control of the purse 
 strings. Mr. Obama actually seemed to be looking for pity. And thats a 
 pity! 
 (Part II) Mr. Obama is a certifiable silly SOB if he finds it necessary to use a 
 teleprompter to talk to a group of 11 year old sixth graders. That is 
 exactly what he did at the Graham Road Elementary School in Falls Church, 
 Va., on Tuesday on Jan. 19, 2010. Any American President, who thinks that 
 the use of a teleprompter while talking to little kids is a good idea is by 
 definition a silly SOB. That goofy decision simply begs for ridicule, and 
 Im glad to oblige. Its worth noting that yesterdays complainers dont 
 bother to deny his silly SOB status, they simply are pissed about him being 
 accurately identified as a silly SOB. The photo showing the presence of a 
 faithful and brave Secret Service agent at his right shoulder is comforting. 
 Ill betcha that the agent was trained to throw himself in front of any 
 incoming spit balls. Youve got to admire those Secret Service dudes. http://news.spreadit.org/obama-teleprompter-6th-grade/

 [ No 
 Name Key request goes against the green ] There is a curious 
 contrariness in the growing support that No Name Key be granted 
 electricity from the grid. While every other American community is being 
 urged to go green, the Keys are considering de-greening a perfect 
 example of a conservationist community. 

 All of us are 
 busy changing light bulbs and insulating our homes to save every single 
 pound of CO2 that we put into an already burdened atmosphere. Now we are 
 being asked to allow 43 homes that are already green to add 500 tons of 
 new CO2 to the problem. 

 It simply does not make sense. City, state and the 
 federal agencies are spending billions of our tax dollars to do exactly 
 the opposite of what No Name Key is requesting. The suggestion to 
 de-green that community goes against the very spirit of the new laws and 
 regulations that are being written. It would not surprise me if this 
 illogical and contrary action were to attract the unwanted attention of 
 one of the hundreds of conservationist organizations in the field. It 
 would also not surprise me if a green group, or even some private 
 taxpayers, became so incensed that they would be moved to mount a 
 lawsuit. Another expensive lawsuit and an additional 500 tons of CO2 is 
 not exactly what Monroe County needs just now. 
 Sneering at Haitians and 
 blaming them for their predicament was a startling piece of hypocrisy 
 from a serf of the US Corporate Republic who aired his contempt for 
 Haiti on this web page yesterday. 

Haiti has suffered under corrupt leadership, US interference, and a 
 drive by foreign corporations to switch their economy from agricultural 
 to light industrial. Now the country has no agriculture, no industry and 
 no hope. Their history is too long and complex to go into here, home of 
 the short-attention-spanned-lesser-educated-white-American-peasant.
It might be a good idea to compare the US to Haiti and ask yourself: how 
 are you to blame for the financial melt down, the rape of the Treasury 
 by the banks and the inability of our President to stand up to them? 

 You don&apos;t realize it but you are the equivalent to 
 the Haitian serf in the current corrupt impoverishment of the US. If you 
 think you have more control over the way your country is run than a 
 Haitian does over how Haiti is run you are delusional. Give it another 
 year and you&apos;ll get to see delusion made real as Republicans and 
 Democrats fall over themselves to increase the bonuses for bankers while 
 you lose your job, your home and your health insurance (if you had any).

 following, when referring to our President and the&quot;Democrat 
 Politicos&quot;: (I have changed his words to reflect the first person 
 instead of the third person so that the CT readers can see that From The 
 Right was actually talking about himself.) &quot;My speeches and style are 
 caricatures of an ego maniacal 5th grade teacher. I don&apos;t talk with 
 you, I talk at you. My themes and choice of verbiage are disrespectful 
 and strongly suggests that I consider my audience and its opposition to 
 be my intellectual inferiors.&quot;  

 Its odd that he thinks he sees these characteristics in others but 
 fails to recognize them in himself.

 [ Immigrants Treated Better then Citizens ] If the 
 immigrant is over 65, they can apply for SSI and Medicaid and get more 
 than a woman on Social Security, who worked from 1944 until 2004. She is 
 only getting $791 per month because she was born in 1924 and there&apos;s a 
 &apos;catch 22&apos;.

It is interesting that the federal government provides a single refugee 
 with a monthly allowance of $1,890. Each can also obtain an additional 
 $580 in social assistance, for a total of $2,470 a month. This compares 
 to a single pensioner, who after contributing to the growth and 
 development of America for 40 to 50 years, can only receive a monthly 
 maximum of $1,012 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement. 

 Maybe our pensioners should apply as refugees!

 [ Conspiracy ] By reading this blog for several 
 years I am thoroughly convinced that the average American is about as 
 smart as a rock or a potato. It amazes me how these people got to be the 
 leaders of the free world. You elected a president that praises Islam 
 and all it did for America, where as Islam is the sworn enemy of America 
 and had pledged to destroy her. Barak Obama has stated that America will 
 never go to war with Islam. Yet Islamic fighters kill American soldiers 
 and civilians every day. Barak Obama is a Muslim through and through, he 
 was put in office to destroy the United States from within. He should be 
 impeached and eliminated as soon as possible. Does and Islamic nuclear 
 device have to devastate an American city before you stupid people wake 
 up to what you are facing? 
 [ Sloan] Pollution. We the people really are the problem I see no way to resolve 
 it in my lifetime, which hopefully will not last much 
 longer because, among other reasons, I do not want to be here when the 
 green slime we the people are manufacturing replaces kudzu as the number 
 one ground cover in my home state Alabama.
 
More to the point, I see no way for we the people to live in sync with 
 Mother Nature while we rely on fossil fuels. We need to figure out how 
 to draw energy from the sun. Or from the hydrogen in water, which should 
 release plenty of oxygen back into the atmosphere. Or maybe we learn how 
 to draw energy out of helium. Or out of dark matter. Or out of 
 anti-matter. Or out of crystals. As long as we use hydrocarbons for 
 fuel, we are going to keep killing Mother Nature.
 
I leave no place in this conundrum for nuclear fuel. Not even the little 
 green people use nuclear fuel to drive their space ships, or for 
 anything. Nuclear power is something only we the people use, and that 
 has a lot to do with why so many little green people are hanging around 
 this planet. They want to make sure we the people dont migrate to other 
 worlds and spread our energy slime there.   More... goodmorningfloridakeys.com

 [ Banks ] 
 Thomas Jefferson said in 1802, &apos;I believe that banking institutions are 
 more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American 
 people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, 
 first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that 
 will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property 
 until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers 
 conquered.&apos; 
 [ Climate Change ] In a statement released 
 Wednesday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said 
 estimates relating to the rate of recession of the Himalayan glaciers in 
 its Fourth Assessment Report were&quot;poorly substantiated&quot;adding that&quot;well-established standards of evidence were not applied properly.&quot; 

 Despite the admission, the IPCC reiterated its concern 
 about the dangers melting glaciers present in a region that is home to 
 more than one-sixth of the world&apos;s population. 

 &quot;Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in 
 snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout 
 the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and 
 changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from 
 major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes)...&quot; 

 &quot;The chair, vice-chairs, and co-chairs of the IPCC,&quot;the 
 statement continued,&quot;regrets the poor application of IPCC 
 procedures...&quot; 

 The apology follows a growing storm of controversy which 
 initially forced the IPCC to concede that data relating to the Himalayan 
 glacier melt included in the 2007 report was not backed up by sufficient 
 scientific data. 
 [ Mars 
 in Opposition ] 
 The big news in the sky this week is that Mars reaches opposition (on 
 the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun). This happens like 
 clockwork, about every 26 months (the last was December 2007, the next 
 is March 2012), and it means not only that Mars rises at sunset and is 
 visible all night, but also that Mars is closer to Earth than it usually 
 is, making it brighter and larger (at least in telescopes) as well. Also 
 like clockwork, oppositions usually give rise to internet hoaxes 
 claiming Mars will appear as big as the full Moon. Marvel at the Red 
 Planet when you get a chance, in spite of the misinformation surrounding 
 oppositions.

 [ From the 
 Right ] Our President and his merry band of sycophants truly are a 
 wondrous bunch. Do you remember 9/13/01 when out progressive pals began 
 to excoriate Mr. Bush for reading a story book to grade school kids on 
 the day that the MFs killed 3000 of our friends, and relatives? Yessir, 
 they should have checked with GWB first. Yep, it was a terrible thing 
 that the President of the USA would have the temerity to read a book to 
 school kiddies on such a day. Just the other day, Mr. Obama decided to 
 do a dog and pony show to school kiddies, a group of 5 th graders I think. The silly SOB actually had to use a teleprompter, not a 
 freaking book. Can you imagine what little Jill and Johnnie must have 
 though as Mr. Obama twisted his head first left, then right, then 
 repeat, like some sort of smooth talking mechanical metronome gone 
 amok. I can just hear little Jerome giggling. Then there is the issue of 
 Obamacare. As amazing as it seems, now Mr. Obama seems determined to 
 pursue Obamacare. He says screw the 60% or so of us who say kill it . Mr. Obama has actually said that he might have not communicated enough 
 with the masses. That comes from the loquacious dude who has given over 
 150 exclusive interviews and well over 400 speeches in the last year.

 Sunday evening I composed an e-mail that was to be sent to a family 
 friend, describing some of our adventures in cactus land. By error, I 
 addressed it to CT. Moments after I sent it, I realized the error. I 
 then sent a note to Deer Ed and asked him to trash the document that I 
 had sent, I asked him not to publish it. I had no intention of it being 
 posted. Apparently Deer Ed failed to see that request and published my 
 personal note. The contents of the note were somewhat distorted by Deer 
 Ed. Thats not a criticism of Deer Ed; hes got a lot on his plate and 
 usually does a damn fine job. The facts are that the person who is 
 invited to the State of the Union address is my son-in-law, not my 
 grandchild. It goes without saying I love them both and that that Im 
 very proud of both of them. My grandson is 13 and very bright, but hes 
 a little young to be a heavy hitter in any industry. It is true that he 
 is a great cleanup hitter in his league. The PV industry refers to the 
 generation of electricity from sunlight, hence P hoto v oltaic. 
 It is an industry that is the darling of the global warmers. By the way, 
 the snow in Flagstaff is hip deep. I suppose it must be global warming.

 My Big Pine Key Radio Shack got broken into again last night. 
 The lone thief smashed the door with a coral rock and grabbed what he 
 could. The thief had a hood covering his face so my security cameras 
 couldnt identify him (Its always a him). I never had a problem with 
 crime in Key West and Im surprised at the different situation here. 
 Its costing me money and sleep (Ive been at the store since 1:30 this 
 morning). 

 If anyone has any leads please notify the Sheriff or call 
 me at 305-872-4267. Thanks for any help you may offer stopping crime in 
 the Keys. ~Kevin Gerard [ Sloan ] I attended 
 last nights zero waste recycling workshop in Old City Hall. Except for 
 City Commissioner Clayton Lopez, I remarked to Mark Howell, Editor of 
 Solares Hill, the nearly-packed chamber was all white.
 
 The presenter owns a zero waste recycling company in 
 Boulder, Colorado, which seemed on the cutting edge of waste reuse 
 vs. waste burning and landfills. However, the zero waste name he uses 
 for his cause is not really accurate. 70 percent waste reuse is 
 outstanding, based on what he said last night. As had others before last 
 night, the presenter recommended three different containers: for food 
 scraps, paper and plastic (as I recall). What he seemed unprepared 
 for, maybe he had not been told it, is Key West is broke and 
 cannot afford to construct the recommended infrastructure for 
 local waste reuse; the city doesnt have the land for such facilities; 
 the Keys geology does not permit burying the wastes that cannot be 
 recycled; and the city will have to contract it all out. 
 
 I told friends later at Sippin Internet Cafe, if I had 
 my way, Id pass an ordinance requiring all residences and businesses to 
 use the three-container method, and Id impose a $100 fine for failure 
 to comply per incident. What we fine people for parking meter and riding 
 bicycles through red lights and stop signs justifies a fine of this size 
 for not non-compliance with three-container recycling. I also said the 
 contract collector would turn non-compying containers upside down on the 
 property and leave it there. 
 
 My friends agreed widespread compliance would quickly 
 follow. My friends also agreed a lot of people would be upset. I said my 
 observation had been that the City Commission has been too reluctant to 
 institute mandatory recyling and separation, beause they dont want to 
 upset people or use force. They want compliance to be voluntary, people 
 to like it. They want it to be easy. Dream on.     More ... goodmorningfloridakeys.com 
 Three 
 weeks ago, the State of Florida deposited $8.85 million with the 
 Clerk of Court for Monroe County to compensate the landowners in Florida DEP v. West for the condemnation of their North Key Largo 
 properties in April 2004. When this eminent domain action was filed as a 
 slow-take in 1995, the State offered a mere $160,000 for the subject 
 properties. Our response to the slow-take was a regulatory taking 
 counter-claim. That was our way to protect landowners from the State&quot;walking away&quot;from any jury verdict it did not like. 

 Land values began to rise in 2001 -- although not on 
 these properties. In 2004 the State opted for a&quot;quick-take.&quot;At that 
 time, the State&apos;s estimated fair market value of the two parcels, based 
 on the confiscatory regulatory scheme, was $630,000. But after executing 
 the quick-take, the State could no longer walk away from a jury verdict 
 that exceeded its budget. After all, nobody had been able to build on 
 North Key Largo since February 8, 1982 (except at the Ocean Reef Club 
 and a few existing subdivisions). 

 After the 2004 quick-takes we re-cast the regulatory 
 taking counter-claim into a jury instruction on condemnation blight. 
 Even though the Florida Supreme Court has embraced condemnation blight 
 on at least two occasions, the State&apos;s in-house attorneys could not 
 grasp the concept. Fortunately we had a trial judge, Luis Garcia, who 
 understands government cannot prohibit a landowner from using his 
 property, and then benefit from its own actions by driving down the 
 property&apos;s acquisition cost. (In 2001, Judge Garcia ruled the same way 
 in another case, Shadek v Monroe Count y, 
 where White&amp;Case attorney Doug Halsey raised the same issues and 
 Monroe County settled by paying $6 million in temporary taking damages.) 
 So ... the 
 government goes down for the count again. I have remarked, on numerous 
 occasions, that the reason for this waste of money is nothing more than 
 the&quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;in small, attractive, relatively 
 well-to-do communities such as the Florida Keys. Those who already own 
 homes in the Keys will do everything in their power to prevent others 
 from doing so. To that end, the&quot;got-miners&quot;elect like-minded County 
 Commissioners, who respond by prohibiting new development wherever they 
 find it. It&apos;s a self-perpetuating, downward spiral that could, unless 
 reversed, bankrupt every owner of developed property in the Keys! ~Sal

[Beast falls of 2009 ] Ouch and double ouch!  This one is really 
 funny. (Ed: That&apos;s one of the reasons we&apos;re late publishing today. We 
 watched the whole thing.) YouTube - 2009 was the Year of Fail! [ Immigrants 
 Treated Better then Citizens ] This message is replete with lies. To 
 begin with, it creates a false comparison between very different federal 
 programs. SSI and Medicaid are different from social security retirement 
 payments. SSI and Medicaid are means-tested public benefits for people 
 with low income and qualifying disabilities. The poster might as well 
 complain about anyone who receives these benefits. But to claim 
 that immigrants and refugees somehow enjoy these benefits more than 
 citizens is absurd. 
 An 
 immigrant who is over 65 cannot automatically apply for SSI and 
 Medicaid. The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 imposed broad restrictions that 
 prevent immigrants from getting most public benefits. These laws are 
 very detailed, but here are the basic facts: 

 Most 
 lawful immigrants (except refugees and some other humanitarian 
 immigrants) who entered the country after 1996 are barred from receiving 
 SSI at all. It is simply not available to them until they become 
 citizens or work for 10 years in the U.S. After that, they are eligible 
 to the same extent as any other resident. 

 Undocumented immigrants cannot get SSI and Medicaid at all. They can 
 only get emergency Medicaid, which is for immediate medical treatment 
 that is severe and could cause serious jeopardy to the patients health. 
 Basically, this means that they can get emergency room services only, 
 with no follow-up care. 

 Most 
 lawful immigrants (except refugees and some other humanitarian 
 immigrants) who entered the country after 1996 are ineligible to receive 
 any federal means-tested public benefit for five years after their 
 lawful admission to the United States. The only major public benefit 
 available during those five years is emergency Medicaid. Otherwise, they 
 have to wait five years before getting any benefits. 

 Refugees 
 are entitled to apply for SSI if they are disabled, but they can only 
 receive it for seven years. After that, they are cut off unless they 
 become citizens. 

 The facts about the support payments that refugees get are totally 
 false. Refugees do get some support payments for 8 months, and certain 
 other benefits like food stamps. However, payments that refugees are 
 given are not permanent. They are for a very limited time. The purpose 
 of these payments is to help displaced refugees find their footing in a 
 new country. These are not comparable to retirement payments.

 Let&apos;s

 style to which they&apos;ve become accustomed (NY lavish), the new jobs there 
 would help out the rest of the population, tourism would follow, and it 
 would get several boatloads of diplomats off our shores. In fact, I 
 think that would be a great new mission for the UN, since they haven&apos;t 
 accomplished anything in decades. They can be the international version 
 of FEMA, Red Cross, Red Crescent, etc, and be the first responders in 
 any disaster.

 [ No 
 Name Key is Green ] Why do people ignore any fact contradicting their 
 factious arguments? Its now a matter of fact that CO2 hasnt changed 
 for at least 150 years. Declaring CO2 a pollutant doesnt make it so. It 
 is part of the Circle of Life. There are few houses on NNK that havent 
 polluting diesel generators. This has been stated over and over, but now 
 its ignored to make an argument. 

 Saying 500 
 tons of CO2 will be added per house is a lie of omission which doesnt 
 take into consideration the diesel generators being eliminated. 
 Furthermore no one is forcing anyone to hook up, only someone dictating 
 their decision on everyone whether or not to have electricity. If you

 from Fl Grid Elec. 39 of the 43 homes on No Name Key have and use 
 generators. No Name Key produces way more CO2 than Keys homes on the 
 grid. 

 During the course of the summer diesel generators use somewhere between 
 1,000 to 1,250 gallons. Using these numbers, each summer an additional 
 6 to 8 tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere by each home running 
 diesel generators. Multiply the numbers and youll see that No Name Key 
 produces tons more CO2 than&quot;normal&quot;Keys homes do. 

 A 10 hp generator engine produces CO at rates of 450-1000 times that of 
 modern idling cars. No Name Key produces emissions equal to thousands of 
 cars each day! 

 Grid-tie is the only way to eliminate the generators, the banks of 
 lead-acid batteries, and the enormous pollution which is No Name Key. 

 Take off the green colored glasses, take your head out of the sand and 
 take a real and honest look at No Name Key and you will see just how 
 black this whole No Name Key environmental sham really is.   

 We are the largest polluting community in the Keys.

 [ &quot;Glued 
 to that Phone&quot;--literally ] When Mr Gardner heard about a Darwin 
 woman who made headlines for getting pulled over by police for a breath 
 test wearing little but her undies, the 43-year-old had a big laugh -- 
 but wasn&apos;t expecting he would be next in line to make the paper for a 
 mishap. 

 &quot;I hit my ear on the boom of my truck and broke the 
 headset of my phone,&quot;Mr Gardner told the Northern Territory News . 

 &quot;So I got some superglue and glued it back together and 
 that was when my boss rang.&quot;The truck driver said he usually had the 
 phone&apos;s headset in his ear most of the day. 

 &quot;I guess I didn&apos;t think much of it when I put it back 
 into my ear to talk to the boss. I drove from Casuarina to Rapid Creek 
 when I realized I had done something kinda stupid.&quot; 

 After having the headset in his ear for more than five 
 minutes the adhesive had hardened and Mr Gardner found himself with a 
 earpiece glued into his ear.&quot;Usually it&apos;s in my ear all day anyway. 
 Friends suggested to leave it in there and just plug my ear into the 
 power point at night to charge it. But I did get a little worried and 
 thought This is not good, this is really not good at all .&quot;

Mr Gardner told the Northern Territory News it crossed his mind 
 to use his pocket knife to remove the unwanted gear from his ear.&quot;I 
 realized I didn&apos;t want to see myself going to a doctor to put my ear 
 back on after I chopped it off. So I used a spoon.&quot; 

 The 43-year-old said he scraped the earpiece out of his 
 ear with a spoon but several pieces of skin were still stuck to the 
 headphone.&quot;Yes, it did hurt, but I guess it hurt my pride much more 
 than it hurt my ear.&quot;

 [ Iguanas 
 Gone Wild ] Iguanas are non indigenous to the Florida Keys and 
 therefore have no standing or protection and killing them is no more 
 than sound pest control. The Florida Keys stock of iguanas has grown 
 rapidly over the last decade. There are several varieties a feral 
 iguana, but the green iguana is most common and the tastiest. It doesnt 
 taste like chicken, its more like pulled pork.

The Florida Keys has sufficient stocks of iguanas to allow avid 
 sportsmen the opportunity to bag a few for the family cook out. The 
 iguanas are called Pollo Del Arbor by local Hispanic groups, or 
 chicken of the trees in English. Iguana stew along with a bottle of red 
 wine makes a great meal. 

 With the 
 newness of iguana recreational harvesting, the Florida Wildlife 
 Commission has yet to set bag limits, license fees, regulations or 
 methods of legally taking the reptilian delicacy. The Iguana Killers 
 Club (IKC) suggests a $5 iguana tag good for a month of air gun 
 hunting that would not only help keep these dirty reptiles in check and 
 it would probably get more young boys/girls to enjoy the thrill of the 
 great sport of hunting. Im working on procuring a Federal grant with 
 local leaders for 1.8 million to be used as bounty payments for each 
 iguana take down. Bounty payments will be based on the length, age, sex 
 and weight of each iguana terminated. All freshly terminated iguanas 
 will have to be presented by the terminator in person at an official 
 weigh station for certification. 

 Looking down 
 the rifle barrel, with your cheek against the gun stock, centering the 
 intended victim in the crosshairs of the scope and gently squeezing the 
 trigger can give the hunter, young, old, male or female a natural high.  

 Concerns by 
 various reptile rights groups Iguana huggers want you to call an 
 animal rescue league so that these invasive reptiles can be euthanized 
 humanely. Dont waste your time. They do not respond. Freezing as a 
 method of euthanasia is generally accepted as humane, just as is a 
 direct head shot from your IKC41 rifle. In the field, a large cooler of 
 heavily brined ice is sufficient. Drop your wounded iguana in and be 
 sure to have a solid locking mechanism for the cooler lid. Once the 
 cooler goes quite and still you know that you have humanly frozen the 
 invasive reptile to death.

Iguana meat is considered a delicacy in the Caribbean Islands and with 
 meat prices as high $28 per pound and with the economy in the tank and 
 still going down, iguana is a good source of freshly killed meat for a 
 family meal. With iguanas being feral game in South Florida, sale of 
 iguana meat is lawful. Kill-and-grill does not constitute a crime. Once 
 you have had a taste of fresh fried Iguana it is doubtful that you will 
 wish to sell or give away any surplus meat. Iguana meat freezes well and 
 keeps for up to six months. The tail tastes about like tender gator 
 tail, and the legs and back strap are as tender as frog legs. Iguana 
 eggs are great cooked as an omelet with fresh goat cheese and a mild 
 salsa sauce.

Parenting is not for everyone! 
[ Stimulus check ] Sometime this year, we taxpayers 
 will again receive an Economic Stimulus payment. This is a very exciting 
 program. I&apos;ll explain it using the Q and A format:

Q. What is an Economic Stimulus payment? A. It is money 
 that the federal government will send to taxpayers.
Q. Where will the government get this money? A. From taxpayers..
Q. So the government is giving me back my own money? A. Only a smidgen.
Q. What is the purpose of this payment? A. The plan is for you to use 
 the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the 
 economy.
Q. But isn&apos;t that stimulating the economy of Asia? A. Shut up or you 
 don&apos;t get your check.

Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the US 
 economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:

1 If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, your money 
 will go to China.
2 If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to Saudi Arabia.
3 If you purchase a computer, it will go to India.
4 If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico, Honduras 
 and Guatemala.
5 If you buy a car, it will go to Japan or Korea.
6 If you purchase useless plastic stuff, it will go to Taiwan.
7 If you pay off your credit cards, or buy stock, it will go to pay 
 management bonuses and be hidden in offshore accounts.

Instead, you can keep the money in America by:

1 Spending it at yard sales or flea markets.
2 Going to baseball or football games.
3 Hiring prostitutes.
4 Buying cheap beer.
5 Getting tattoos.

These are the only wholly-American-owned businesses still 
 operating in the US.

Conclusion: The best way to stimulate the economy is to go 
 to a ball game with a prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink 
 beer all day until you&apos;re drunk enough to go get tattooed. 
 [ White 
 Line Fever ] It sure would be nice if the City of Key West or someone 
 would repaint the white lines marking the lanes on N. Roosevelt, at 
 least from the split over to Kennedy Dr.  They about gone and traffic 
 wanders all over, especially around the curve. 
 [No Name Electric ] The naive writer from Key West who stated that we are going against 
 the green needs to check her facts. There is nothing green about 
 No-Name Key as it currently exists. The writer clearly does not 
 understand what constitutes a green community. 

   

 We all bought compact florescent bulbs back in the day 
 when they were $10 a piece, and we are very conscious of our energy use 
 here. The average full-time resident of No Name Key, however, will burn 
 1000 gallons of diesel fuel or gasoline over the course of a year (that 
 translates into more than 10 tons of carbon dioxide). So where the 
 writer comes up with the notion that bringing us grid power will add 500 
 tons of new CO2 to the problem is a mystery. Grid power has a far 
 smaller carbon footprint than locally produced generator power. 

   

 So-called solar homes are really battery-operated homes. 
 We charge (very un-green) lead acid batteries with our solar panels, but 
 only during the daytime. And no matter how hard we try, we cannot get 
 solar power to run air conditioners in the summer. It simply doesnt 
 work, so we run (very un-green) generators. Living without air 
 conditioning is not an option. 

   

 Connecting No Name Key to the grid would do two things. 
 It would take 35 generators off-line, and it would allow for the proper 
 use of our solar panels. As things stand today, once our batteries are 
 full, all of the clean, renewable solar energy that we produce goes 
 completely to waste. When we have a grid connection, we can supply our 
 excess solar power to Keys Energy who will turn around and sell it to 
 its customers, making the whole county greener. 

   

 For too long, the citizens of Monroe County have been 
 sold a bill of goods about our perfect example of a conservationist 
 community. I invite the writer to come out and see what its really 
 like on the ground, so she can understand how solar panels really work, 
 and why a grid connection will bring No Name Key closer to the model 
 green community.

 [ Exotic 
 Pet Amnesty Day ] In an effort to keep unwanted exotic pets out of 
 Floridas native ecosystems, the FWC and Miami MetroZoo will host the 
 sixth Nonnative Pet Amnesty Day March 21 at MetroZoo. To help Keys 
 residents unable to make the long drive, local shelters and wildlife 
 organizations are teaming up to collect and deliver them to the Miami 
 event.  

 Part of the 
 local No Pets Left Behind project, Amnesty Day volunteers consist of 
 advocates for pets and wildlife.  

 Many exotic 
 pets seem cool to own at first, but as they grow, or show off their 
 wilder side, the pet owner often regrets their decision explains Alison 
 Higgins, Land Conservation Program Manager for the Nature Conservancy 
 and chair of the Florida Keys Invasive Exotics Task Force. It is never 
 a good idea to let your pet loose they will either fare poorly, or 
 live well off of other native species. Neither of these options are 
 beneficial. This annual Amnesty Day option allows a humane and 
 eco-friendly outcome. 

 Exotic reptiles, amphibians, birds, fish and mammals will be accepted; 
 domestic pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens, etc.) will not be 
 accepted.

 [ No Name Key Grid Tie Electricity ] Yesterday a 
 writer wrote about No Name Key as a&quot;perfect example of a 
 conservationist community&quot;. She couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. That writer must have little, to no, knowledge of solar energy and its 
 limitations, or I suspect, is trying to once again&quot;muddy the water&quot;so 
 that the real truth about No Name is hidden.  

 I am fond of my solar power. I don&apos;t have a clothes 
 dryer, a dishwasher, or a large screen TV and I consider myself, at a 
 minimum, a conservationist. I also consider myself a realist. You have 
 to face facts folks, solar and wind power need backups. These backups 
 are either batteries or generators or grid-tie electricity.  

 Right now everyone on No Name relies on generators in 
 times of need and most generators on the island need to be run on 
 a daily basis. Many of them are on and off for several hours of the day 
 and night. Some actually run 24/7. In the summer it is even worse due 
 to the use of fans and A/Cs.  There is constant loud noise. Vibrations, 
 toxic air pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and giant diesel fuel 
 tanks are all part of daily life on No Name. This is not a green 
 solution. It is not a model conservationist community. Allowing No 
 Name residents the option of hooking up to the electrical grid would be 
 a big win for the environment and the quality of life for residents. Everyone sees the Keys as an environmental paradise--little do they know 
 our dirty little secret. Contrary to what yesterday&apos;s poster said, 
 grid-tie would result in a complete reduction of noise and harmful 
 emissions, not an increase. 

 Nobody on No Name wants any more development. There are 
 a multitude of laws preventing any more homes from being built out 
 here. Preventing homeowners from moving forward with modern 
 environmental technologies is not only illegal but shows a complete lack 
 of understanding of science, technology and environmental stewardship.

 [ From the Right ] State of the Union Night Its a big night tonight, folks. Mr. Obama takes to the airways to try 
 to convince us that the State of the Union is just dandy. I&apos;ll spare us

 broken promises. With out a doubt he will try to convince you and me 
 that a&quot;Spending Freeze&quot;will the magical Father John&apos;s potion that will 
 cure our out of control debt accumulation. That is nothing but more 
 noxious Donkey Dung. First of all in the last year our national debt has 
 increased geometrically, it is now the highest it has ever been and only 
 the second highest as a percent of GDP in our history while unemployment 
 continues to grow to over 10%. Over two million jobs have gone 
 south since the passage of the stimulus bill that he promised would cap 
 it at 8%. Mr. Obama has been growing our government faster than maggots 
 grow on a dead fish in August. A&quot;freeze&quot;won&apos;t reduce our spending one 
 stinking penny. If we don&apos;t cut spending we can&apos;t reduce our debt, and 
 we can&apos;t cure our economy. We desperately need to cut spending, big 
 time. 

 Keeping spending at its current levels is like tossing an 
 anchor to a drowning man. The only good outcome is that you will know 
 where the corpse can be found.

 [ Death Threats ] Obama is black and tried to 
 reform healthcare and save our sick economy (that he inherited). 

 Bush started two unwinnable wars (one of them under 
 false pretence), ran the economy down, allowed the World Trade 
 Center and Pentagon attacks, trashed our civil rights, kidnapped and 
 tortured our enemiesto mention just a fewoh, and hes white. But 
 they want to kill Obama. 
 

France is trying to outlaw the wearing of the burka in

 [ No Name Key Electric ] I see no reason why the 
 residents of No Name Key should not be allowed to have access to 
 water and electricity.   Many years ago my father purchased 
 property on Little Torch Key. There was no water or electricity 
 there and he knew it. He purchased the property because of the 
 scenic view and location.  He was also an electrician. He 
 literally put the electricity in himself. The electrical inspector 
 came out and inspected it, approved it, and City Electric turned the 
 power on.  We spent several years on a cistern, and then he had a 
 family friend put in water.  FKAA put in a water meter and we 
 hooked up to water up on the highway.    

 When a resident on No Name Key says his house is 
 almost 90 degrees in the summer months, he doesnt want electricity 

 to improve the value of his house, he wants 
 electricity to stay cool in July, August, and September.  I cant 
 believe anyone would want to deny the residents water and 
 electricity.    Even if they did want it to increase the value of 
 their property, why would you care? Thats the American way.   

 My dad liked to buy property that no one else wanted 
 and build on it and improve it.   In the 1980s he bought property 
 on the Big Island of Hawaii to build a vacation home. There were 
 only three other homes in the area. He hooked up to electricity but 
 there was no water. The neighbors had been on cisterns for many, 
 many years.  My dad found out he could install pipes and hook up to 
 the water down the mountain.  He asked the neighbors if theyd like 
 to hook up too.  Not only did no one try to stop him from bringing 
 in water, they were so thrilled, they got several men from their 
 Mormon Church to help my dad with the manual labor.   Thats the 
 way it should be--neighbors helping neighbors. I see no reason why 
 the residents on No Name Key shouldnt have utilities.   The ones 
 that dont want it dont have to hook up.  Good Luck NNK residents. 
 Why 
 are the Tea Baggers for the new Senator Scott Brown? Do they 
 like US Senators who pose completely nude in Cosmo? (can you 
 imagine what would have happened if Obama would have done that?) Do 
 they know that he is for legalized abortion? (I thought Pro-life was 
 one of the biggest concerns of the Tea Baggers?) And, he supports 
 licensing and background checks for buying guns. I guess that means 
 there must only be two reasons why the Tea Baggers support Sen. 
 Brown: 1. He has Republican in front of his name 2. He is not 
 Obama! 
 [ Trauma Star s cost was approved by 55% of the

 less than 30% of all the people who voted. Because the majority of 
 the people who voted did not vote on the TS referendum because they 
 knew it was non-binding, meaning the results of their vote did not 
 matter, so why vote. Your TS noise is just more job justification 
 BS. Now go spin that fact! 
 
[ No monthly bill with the Sun producing all your power] It 
 takes a lot of solar panels and batteries to power a 5 ton air 
 conditioner. The No Name residents typically don&apos;t have enough room 
 for that many panels, so they use generators. These generators 
 pollute in the worse way, totally offsetting the benefits of&quot;being 
 green.&quot; Are you getting the picture now? 
 If the No Namers can get utilities even though 
 they knew they werent allowed when they bought their property, can 
 we get rid of the Key deer too? I knew they were here when I bought

 [ Sloan ] 
 I was notified by email of being nominated for a green living award by GLEE and was told I had to fill out an application stating my 
 green achievements to enter the contest.
 
My first thought, if I was nominated for an award, why should I have 
 to apply for anything? Did Barack Obama apply for the Nobel Peace 
 Prize after he was nominated? 

 My next thought, Ive made lots of suggestions about 
 how to help Mother Nature in the Keys, and so far I havent seen 
 GLEE or any other local organization or local government use any of 
 them. 

 For examples:
I harped people who smoke tobacco regularly, pound for pound, put 
 out as much air pollution as any car, truck, boat, airplane, 
 factory.
I harped no new building permits in the Keys for structures that are 
 not solar and cistern self-sufficent.
I harped putting solar collectors on all roofs in Key West.
I harped painting roofs white, to save air conditioning costs.
I harped mandatory recycling and no garbage pickup that is not 
 separated.|
I harped treating Keys wastewater to bring it to potable and put it 
 back into the Aqueduct.
I harped community gardens on local government land, irrigated with 
 treated wastewater.
I harped putting a toll at the top of Key Largo, to raise money to 
 install countywide sewerage collection and treatment.
I harped fixing the leaking sewer laterals in Key West, of which 
 there still are many.
I harped against deep injection wells.
I harped stop killing the reef with human effluent.
I harped stop allowing cruise ships into Key West, which dump their 
 raw effluent offshore instead of treating it.
I harped no more new development, period, the end; the Keys already 
 are way overdeveloped, everyone knows this, no one can stand in 
 front of a mirror and honestly deny it.
I harped leave No Name Key off the grid and not allow further 
 development on Big Pine Key.
I harped Mother Natures rights supersede human rights.
I harped anyone living in the Keys who calls him/herself an 
 environmentalist is delusional; there is no way to live in sync with 
 Mother Nature in the Keys, unless you live like the Calusa Indians 
 lived here.
I harped human beings are the invasive species in the Keys.
I harped the real environmental solution is a Category 5 hurricane, 
 that comes in at Key West and runs up the Keys to the mainland at 
 Category 5 force the entire transit. 

 The other night, I told a young man who had earlier 
 approached me about his becoming a shaman, who said he was worried 
 about chemtrails and the conspiracy theories around them, that 
 human beings are the invasive species on this planet and any real 
 environmentalist would kill him/herself to help Mother Nature. I 
 didnt say I would kill myself. 

 I dont belong to GLEE and dont want to belong. I 
 dont think its really serious about putting Mother Nature first. 
 Nor, apparently, am I.

 [ No Name Key electric ] In response to the 
 blogger who wrote,&quot; Why would anyone in their right mind spend 
 any money on the utility so they could get an electric bill every 
 month? There is no monthly bill with the Sun producing all your 
 power.&quot;  I live on NNK and here&apos;s 10 reasons why. 

 1. I have a legal right to electricity. Period, end 
 of story. Solar is not free. Solar is one piece of a system...
2. My house is run on lead acid batteries as well as every other 
 house out here except one which is solely run on generator. 
3. How I charge my toxic, lead acid batteries (which cost $6000.) 
 is with solar panels which cost $8000.
4. The solar panels run through a controller. I have two, each of 
 which costs $400-500.
5. The power for my house comes directly from the toxic lead acid 
 batteries and goes through an inverter ($1500-2000) of which I have 
 two and changes the DC power to AC/DC. All of this does not 
 including the peripherals of the system. 
6. I have a medium size system and cannot run AC so I have a 
 generator which cost $10,000 and for which during the summer months 
 have diesel fuel bills from $500-700.
7. We have two neighbors with large systems of about 8000W costing 
 about $60,000 and still not enough for AC.
8. The generators emit large quantities of CO2.
9. I knew (well documented) that electricity was going to NNK when 
 I bought the property on which I built my house.
10. I have a legal right to electricity and to spend my money on 
 utilities however I wish as I live in a democracy.  

 What is amazing to me is how uninformed most people 
 are about alternative energy and believe the perpetrated myth that 
 when I bought electricity was not coming. I, and most of my 
 neighbors, bought here knowing (again, well documented) electricity 
 was coming including one or two folks who purchased property, not 
 wanting electricity, even knowing electricity was coming.  

 Why would anyone in their right mind talk about a 
 topic without even a modicum of understanding on the topic and have 
 any concern about how I spend my money or that I live in a democracy 
 and someone, who is misinformed, tells me I can&apos;t have electricity. 

 In summary, 2-9 are irrelevant as I have the legal 
 right to have utilities. 
 [ Even 
 glass rots in the Keys] My CBS stilt house was built new in 
 1991. Today it needs almost everything replaced. Some of the floor 
 plywood is rotted, the copper plumbing is shot, my Jalousie windows 
 are junk, the roof was already replaced twice, most of the wiring is 
 corroded beyond salvaging, the stucco needs redoing, the wood stairs 
 need replacement, all aluminum fixtures are half gone, even the 
 glass in the windows is rotting. I should have bought an island, 
 built a large Tiki Hut, wrapped it in heavy bug screen and lived 
 like a native.

 [ Se Habla Muslim ] It would be impossible for 
 President Obama to speak in Muslim during his State of the Union 
 address. There is no such language. The language generally 
 associated with Muslim people is Arabic. 

 And while were at it, the religion is Islam. There 
 is one god, Allah. The main prophet is Mohammad. However, Mohammad 
 is not considered to be Allah&apos;s son. 

 It is amazing how uninformed the average American is.

 [ From the Right on 
 the road] High folks, nice trip so far except for having to veer off of I10 
 in a serious dust storm to avoid headlines. All the wedding festivities are 
 finished, and we will leave here (Gold Canyon Golf Resort, near Mesa) early 
 tomorrow and beat feet for the Grand Canyon. This area is remarkably 
 beautiful. The contrast between the desert and the mountains, some snow 
 capped, is breathtaking. There are reports of multi feet of snow in the area 
 of the canyon, so we might have to divert. We had a grand time in Tucson, 
 strenuously avoiding conversation about anything remotely resembling 
 politics. The grand kids are an absolute joy, well regale you late. After 
 we left, and were on the road toward Phoenix, we got a cell call from my kid 
 who was button-busting proud of the fact that my grandson had been invited 
 to attend the State of the Union message. I think that she was a little 
 nonplussed by our rather subdued, Thats nice dear. It seems that my 
 grandson is even more of a heavy hitter in the PV(?) industry than we had 
 believed. 

 (Part II) Im 
 fascinated at the speechifing styles of so many of the leading Democrat 
 politicos. They share common traits; their speeches and style are 
 caricatures of an egomaniacal 5th grade teacher. They dont talk with you, 
 they talk at you. Their themes and choice of verbiage are disrespectful and 
 strongly suggest that they consider their audience and their opposition to 
 be their intellectual inferiors. Their sniffing elitism is always as evident 
 as the donkey dung aroma of their message. An example was the Dem packaged 
 dig line against Mr. Brown, Senator elect from Mass. The message was that he 
 is a clod, not worth a vote, simply because he drives a truck. A subtext of 
 that message is that only an elite deserves your vote, and elites would 
 never drive a truck. That message was an important part of the Democrat 
 campaign tactics. Even the President of the United States stooped low 
 enough to toss that kind of crap. We all know that only a fraction of the 
 Billions allocated for economic stimulus have been spent. It is an absolute 
 sure bet that the money will gushing out the various states within the next 
 few months. You can be sure that the lions share of the moneys will be 
 allocated to those states wherein there is a strong Republican Congressional 
 candidate snapping at the heels of an incumbent Dem. In those state the 
 incumbent Dem will have waves of bucks to spread around his/her state so 
 that he/she can brag. Look for Mr. Obama to give yet another Rah Rah, I, I, 
 I, campaign speech wherein he speaks more of his personal prowess and the 
 problems that he has had to personally endure, than he does of the USA.. Do 
 you suppose that he will speak of his failure to close Gitmo, of his failure 
 to pass Obamacare, of his failure to drive down unemployment, of his failure 
 win the Olympic Games for the US, of his failure to prevail at Copenhagen? 
 Do you suppose he will speak of his failure to influence the elections in 
 NJ, Mass, or Virginia? I doubt any of those will be discussed unless it is 
 in the context of Mr. Obama being the victim.

 [ Sloan on No Name Electric ] This was the second Sloan 
 clobber from this writer. His name, Jim, and his email address keysconcerns@gmail.com .
 
Yep, I touted my residential real estate law credentials in another life, 
 earned in the trenches, to show Jim and others who read that post that at 
 one time I was a T -Rex when it 
 came to defending home buyers. This was well known in Birmingham, Alabama, 
 where I practiced law, and well known in the National Association of 
 Realtors nationally. Yet and despite having been a home buyers champion, I 
 can not now bring myself to sympathize with Jim and the other No Name Key 
 homeowners who want public electricity and water, because they could could 
 have bought/built homes anywhere else in the Keys. They knew what they were 
 doing, and I hate to think there might be a judge in Florida who will 
 sympathize with them.
 
Jim held forth in yesterdays clobber that he is bigger than being just 
 concerned about No Name Key. He said he is concerned about the welfare of 
 all of the Keys. Alas, I have yet to see one word he has written since he 
 made my acquaintance that indicated he has any concern for any part of the 
 Keys but his own back yard: No Name Key.
 
Maybe Jim woke up, became a born-again environmentalist. But then, maybe he 
 had in mind all along acquiring on the cheap (compared to other Keys 
 residential real estate opportunities) a home on No Name Key, so he could 
 launch this very war to get power and electricity out to No Name Key, so he 
 could make a tidy profit.
 
From having practiced law too many years for my own good, people law mostly, 
 and from having been in worse trenches since then, I know people shade their 
 words in the light most favorable to them, and it is really dumb not to keep 
 that ever in mind when they speak of something in which they have a personal 
 interest, especially a pecuniary interest. Pecuniary means money. 

 Even if you had never seen a turnip truck to fall off of, you 
 would know this is pure business for Jim and has nothing to with the 
 environment. I dont blame him for trying to get his way, but I am not going 
 to roll over for him. I hope the County Commission, Fish&amp;Wildlife,  DCA , 
 and whatever other agency might be involved dont either.
 
The County Commission, Fish&amp;Wildlife, Department of Community Affairs are 
 not bound by the same laws homeowners are bound by. The County Commission, 
 Fish&amp;Wildlife, DCA could jimmy 
 this around and give Jim and his cohorts what they want. And No Name Key 
 property owners who sold at distressed prices because they could not get 
 public electricity and water could then sue all of the above agencies for 
 changing their tune. Those former No Name Key property owners probably would 
 receive a great deal of sympathy in the courts.
 
Jim and his cohorts on No Name Key dont care about that or the financial 
 condition of Monroe County, which such a lawsuit would certainly 
 worsen. All Jim and his No Name Key cohorts care about is changing their 
 spots and making a bundle doing it. More ... goodmorningfloridakeys.com

[ Sibling rivalry ] My cousin sent this picture of his New England

 [ Haiti ] I can&apos;t believe that anyone would say such horrible things 
 about a poor country like Haiti; a country that has gone through generations 
 of misery and catastrophic devastation. Yesterday&apos;s poster does not 
 represent the caring and generous people of America who have always showed 
 their support for people in need. The telethon broadcast on CNN and MSNBC 
 was the most amazing event that I have seen in a long time. The soulful 
 artistry of the singers was amazing and the generosity of the American 
 people was heartwarming.  

 Although we all love our country, at some point we have to recognize the 
 common bond that connects us all as human beings. We are all citizens of the 
 planet Earth. We are not better than those people, we are just luckier. Did the poster actually call those starving, thirsty, homeless and desperate 
 people&quot;dumb bastards&quot;? These people are trying to survive. I think most of 
 us would do whatever we could to grab food to feed our children. He&apos;s 
 worried about his tax dollars when hundreds of thousands of people are 
 suffering and need help? The New York Times stated that every 
 American has contributed, through tax dollars, 80 cents per year for the 
 last three years to help Haiti. I wonder if the poster can afford 80 cents.  

 For 
 Gods sake, does this person have a heart? I hope he&apos;s not one of my 
 neighbors because I consider him to be the&quot;dumb bastard&quot;!

 [ No 
 Name Electric ] The Monroe County Comp Plan Policy being used against No 
 Name Key has been misquoted and misused. The Comp Plan does not prohibit 
 utilities to No Name Key, it prohibits utilities to CBRS units. 

 Heres exactly what that Comp Plan policy (102.8.5) says: 

 Upon adoption of the Comprehensive Plan, Monroe County shall initiate 
 efforts to discourage the extension of facilities and services provided by 
 the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority and private providers of electricity and 
 telephone service to CBRS units. 

 I do 
 live on No Name Key, but my subdivision (consisting of 2/3rds of the NNK 
 homes) is not located in a CBRS unit area. So what is the Countys 
 justification for interfering with, or attempting to deny me the electricity 
 I am allowed by both State law, and the County Comp Plan?

 give him 25 percent down and he&apos;ll think about it. This is guaranteed to

 (eD: No edIT SatuRDAY!!!!!!......b-cuz u 
 assd 4 iT!!!!!!!!! This week&apos;s newsbarometer.com features a comprehensive article on the No Name Key war between the 30 home 
 owners who want public electricity and water run out there, and the 13 
 homeowners owners who dont. I read that prior owners of No Name Key 
 property, who back a ways had sold their property at distress prices to the 
 refuge, because they couldnt get public electricity and water out there, 
 want their land back, or damages, if the 30 owners get what they seek. Some 
 mention of litigation against Monroe County, litigation I didnt see much 
 way for them to lose, if the 30 get what they want.
 
So I called Steve Estes off the number in the News-Barometer. I suppose I 
 should not have been surprised that he was at the office. We had a pretty 
 long talk. He reminded me that this whole mess was already in court once, 
 and the judge ruled against the No Name Key owners who wanted public 
 electricity and power run out there. 
 
 When I asked who the main agitators out there are now, Steve 
 said a man, last name Nichols. A woman, last name Ramsay-Vickery, who is 
 Rick Ramsays sister. Rick is #2 in command at the Sheriffs Office; 
 Ramsay-Vickerys husband lives part time on No Name Key, part time in 
 California, and is a real estate speculator. And a woman lawyer, last name 
 Bakke (spelling?), who just recently passed the Florida Bar (she had 
 practiced somewhere else before moving to No Name Key maybe three years 
 ago). She is representing the No Name Key Homeowners Association, and will 
 file the lawsuit on their (and her) behalf, if they dont get public 
 electricity and water.
 
When Steve mentioned a lawyer who has himself for a lawyer having a fool for 
 a client, this ex-lawyer laughed heartily. If, in fact, this case already 
 has been decided by a court and is brought again, it could, without too much 
 imagination, be viewed as a frivolous and/or malicious lawsuit, abuse of the 
 court process. If it heads in that direction, a Defendant County/County 
 Commission could, and should, ask the judge to award punitive damages 
 against the No Name Key plaintiffs and their lawyer, in addition to 
 litigation costs. 
 
 Id love to be a fly on the wall if lawyer Bakke has to 
 explain that not so happy ending to the other two members of the No Grid 
 Key Gang of Three, and to the rest of the fools who let her represent them 
 in the lawsuit. I hope Lawyer Bakke has a heap of malpractice coverage. And 
 I hope she has friends in the Florida Bar Association Disciplinary 
 Section, where she will have to report the outcome of being successfully 
 sued for filing a malicious civil lawsuit.
 
I am in agreement with Steve that the County Commission should do nothing 
 about running utilities out to No Name Key. Order county staff to lay low 
 until the future putative plaintiffs, led by the Fool Key Gang of Three, 
 have gotten the okay from the U.S. Fish&amp;Wildlife Service and the Florida 
 Department of Community Affairs.

 each war.&quot; He was a devout religious person, UNTIL he realized all 
 religions are nothing more than non-productive businesses run by 
 questionable people. I agree! I have little faith is the advise we get from the web 
 on any subject. Looking at web sites for answers to construction 
 questions, all we seem to get are sales pitches, whether the produce 
 really works or not! There is no honor in people any more! 
 OK, so generators produce 300% more CO2 emissions that 
 electricity produced from Fl Grid Elec., what does that really mean?  

   

 Heres 
 something relatable: a 10 hp generator engine produces CO at rates of 
 450-1000 times that of modern idling cars ( source: idling automotive emissions: Frey, H., et al, 
 2003 ) .  

 The average generators out here are between 10 20 
 hp.    

 39 of the 43 homes on No Name Key have and use 
 generators.  

 You do the math; its pretty scary when you look at it 
 with reality.  

   

 Would you really want to breathe emissions from Thousands of cars each day? 

 -No well 
 thats exactly what we produce, and are forced to breathe every day! 

   

 Grid-tie is the only way to eliminate the generators, the 
 banks of lead-acid batteries, and the enormous pollution which IS No Name Key. 

   

 The fact that 
 here we (No Name Key) sit, the largest untapped solar farm in the 
 State, and the biggest polluting community in the Keys , is a sad 
 statement on what people do, and do not, know about battery homes, 
 about solar, about generators, about grid-tie; and about what 
 sustainable green energy really is. 

   

 True Environmentalists and the Informed 
 already know that grid-tie is the only sustainable modern solution and 
 is the only way No Name Key will ever be green. 

   

 Once you take off the rose colored green glasses and take a real and honest look at No Name Key, you too will see 
 just how black this whole No Name Key environmental sham really is. 

 

 The Stupidity of You Knew : 

   

 You 
 knew the old 7 mile bridge was the only bridge when you moved here, so you 
 cant drive on the new one. 

   

 You 
 knew that the water pipes were above ground, were old, rusting, and broke (A 
 LOT!) when you moved here, so you cant connect to the new modern 
 underground pipes --unhook immediately. 

   

 You 
 knew when you moved here there were no central sewers, so you cant have the 
 ones that are being set in place now --maybe you can have a composting 
 toilet like that one person suggests. 

   

 You 
 knew when you moved here that your lot was empty, did not have a home on it, 
 so tear your house down --how dare you build, you had no right to 
 anything but that empty lot, and we think your lot is special so you 
 shouldnt be there. 

   

 You 
 knew your empty lot did not have an electricity or water connection --so 
 disconnect immediately, you are not allowed to have, or pay for, those 
 luxuries. 

   

 You 
 knew that US1 was only one lane in each direction, so stop using the expanded 
 lane you are not allowed to drive on that half of the road. 

   

 You 
 knew there was no Publics, Home Depot, Walgreen, etc., so stop shopping 
 there, you should know better. 

   

 Who cares is State Law allowed any of it you knew it wasnt here or there. 

   

 Oh the Absolute Sheer Stupidity of you knew . 

  What I cannot understand is why people here want a 
 small fortune for doing next to nothing, business wise and labor wise. 
 You are supposed to work a 40 hour week and collect more then enough to 
 pay for your life style or go to another job that does. If people 
 thought this way, none of the&quot;brothels&quot;would stay open in the keys! 
 Working two or more jobs is hazardous to one&apos;s health! KKK reference..   Perhaps the poster calling Republicans 
 defacto KKK supporters should do a little reading on the history of the 
 KKK.   The KKK started as a Democratic party organ 
 in Tennessee. The Democratic party has a long and well documented 
 history with the KKK.   Not the Republicans.....    Even a dumb Canuck can see that :-)   &quot; Ku Klux Klan in 
 the Reconstruction Era 
From 1868 through the early 1870s the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) 
 functioned as a loosely organized group of political and social 
 terrorists. The Klan&apos;s goals included political defeat of the Republican 
 Party and the maintenance of absolute white supremacy in response to 
 newly gained civil and political rights by southern blacks after the 
 Civil War (1861-65).

The Klan&apos;s organized terrorism began most notably on 
 March 31, 1868, when Republican organizer George Ashburn was murdered in 
 Columbus, Georgia.

 
Over the following months Klan-inspired violence spread throughout 
 Georgia&apos;s Black Belt and into the northwestern corner of the state. Most 
 Klan action was designed to intimidate black voters and white supporters 
 of the Republican Party.&quot; 

 

 Or how about this one.... 

 Sure he admits now that his 
 membership in the Klan was a mistake but what does any politician do to 
 stay in power?? lie?? [ have it relocated? ] Any 
 varmint big enough to be a threat to the legitimate occupants of my yard 
 will be relocated to his next life. Without further consultation. (situation in Haiti) I&apos;m tired of hearing about it and seeing it on my TV! Hear the low drone of 
 heavy planes flying over the Key&apos;s? Those are your tax dollars being spent 
 by the boatload. Then when the helicopters try to land to distribute the 
 food the dumb bastards won&apos;t even get out of the way. Then there are those 
 robbing and raping their own people. They are also bringing them to Florida 
 so they can work and the ones that were here already get amnesty and get to 
 work here for at least 18 months competing for the same jobs that every 
 unemployed American is trying to find. Had this same thing happened in 
 America I don&apos;t think the powers that be would have moved so fast to respond 
 with aid. Hell Louisiana is still trying to recover. Wal-Mart is building in Big Pine 
 after all. Nope it&apos;s Walgreens [ The shot went through his butt 
 and into the bomb which detonated; he was blown to pieces.] Nice touch! 
 A 
 picture began circulating in November. It should be 
 &apos;The Picture of the Year,&apos; or perhaps, &apos;Picture of 
 the Decade.&apos; It won&apos;t be. In fact,unless you 
 obtained a copy of the US paper which published it, 
 you probably would never have seen it. 
 The picture is that of a 21-week-old unborn baby 
 named Samuel Alexander Armas , who is being operated 
 on by surgeon named Joseph Bruner. 
 The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would 
 not survive if removed from his mother&apos;s womb. 
 Little Samuel&apos;s mother, Julie Armas, is an 
 obstetrics nurse in Atlanta . She knew of Dr. 
 Bruner&apos;s remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing 
 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville 
 , he performs these special operations while the 
 baby is still in the womb.. 
 During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus 
 via C-section and makes a small incision to operate 
 on the baby. As Dr.Bruner completed the surgery on 
 Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully 
 developed hand through the incision and firmly 
 grasped the surgeon&apos;s finger. DrBruner was reported 
 as saying that when his finger was grasped, it was 
 the most emotional moment of his life, and that for 
 an instant during the procedure he was just frozen, 
 totally immobile. 
 The photograph captures this amazing event with 
 perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture, 
 &apos;Hand of Hope.&apos; The text explaining the picture 
 begins, &apos;The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel 
 Alexander Armas emerges from the mother&apos;s uterus to 
 grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking 
 the doctor for the gift of life.&apos; 
 Little Samuel&apos;s mother said they &apos;wept for days&apos; 
 when they saw the picture. She said, &apos;The photo 
 reminds us pregnancy isn&apos;t about disability or an 
 illness, it&apos;s about a little person.&apos;Samuel was born 
 in perfect health, the operation 100 percent 
 successful. 
 Now see the actual picture, and it is 
 awesome...incredible.....and hey, pass 
 it on. 
 The world needs to see this one!

 Robert Carlyle Byrd (born 
 November 20, 1917) is the senior United States Senator from West 
 Virginia, and a member and former Senate Leader of the Democratic Party. 
 Byrd has been a Senator since January 3, 1959, and is the 
 longest-serving Senator as well as the longest-serving member in 
 congressional history. He has been the Dean of the Senate since 2003. 
 He is also the oldest current member of the Congress, and is the first 
 person to serve uninterrupted for half a century as a U.S. senator. 

 Byrd joined the Ku Klux Klan 
 when he was 24 in 1942. His local chapter unanimously elected him 
 Exalted Cyclops. 

 According to Byrd, a Klan 
 official told him,&quot;You have a talent for leadership, Bob... The country 
 needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation.&quot;Byrd later 
 recalled,&quot;suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had 
 recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought 
 of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, 
 it did.&quot;Byrd held the titles Kleagle (recruiter) and Exalted Cyclops. 

 In 1944, Byrd wrote to 
 segregationist Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo:
I shall never fight in the armed forces with a Negro by my side... 
 Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the 
 dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become 
 degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the 
 wilds.

 Hitler Dubbed Video: You obviously did not watch the video a year ago as 
 it was on the Brown win in Massachusetts just a few days ago.   Frozen Fish: The fish inshore don&apos;t have any where that they can go to 
 dive. The fish on the reef and in hawks channel did quite well. This 
 kill was not as bad as the last as the water cooled more gradually than 
 the last cold snap that dropped the water temp in our bay (Pine Channel) 
 form 79 one day down to 51 the next. Even the large strong fish did not 
 have time to retreat and the were more dead fish and more large dead 
 fish. Remember that shallow water looses its heat fast.    Steve Estes and the News Barometer continue to 
 present unfair and unbalanced coverage of the No Name Key electricity 
 issue. In fact, it gets quite humerus once you realize the pathetic 
 level to which he is willing to stoop.    a) Two weeks ago, Steve reported that since parts of NNK 
 were in the federal CBRS system, that no sewers or electricity could 
 pass to or through No Name if ANY part of the entire electricity 
 infrastructure from No Name to Turkey Point was ever paid for by a 
 federal dollar. That&apos;s complete hooey and he knows it. There are 
 numerous examples available to refute this, however; I won&apos;t bore you 
 with them all. In fact, in an early example, a federally funded sewage 
 treatment plant in Brevard county was allowed to put a pipe through a 
 CBRS unit, and pop out on the other side to a federally funded sewage 
 project at a development south of the CBRS unit. I find it difficult to 
 understand how Steve Estes isn&apos;t aware of this because it was faxed from 
 the Washington DC CBRS office to his NNK ex-planning commissioner buddy 
 way back on 5/24/1996. In fact, that apparent weakness in the federal 
 law was used to craft a much more severe utility prohibition for NNK 
 (County Resolution P61-01) by the then sitting Monroe County planning 
 commissioner (and NNK resident) who was trying to derail a development 
 from being built next door (Galleon Bay-see below)   b) Last week, Steve attempted to drag US Fish and 
 Wildlife into the fray by saying that FKAA on Big Pine Key certainly 
 won&apos;t be able to put sewer pipes into the ground on scarified property 
 next to existing roads without causing some huge mitigation issues. He 
 is actually hoping to make this non-issue news because stopping central 
 sewers on Big Pine would almost certainly keep them from No Name. Can 
 you tell me how putting pipes underground next to roads is going to 
 cause a problem?    c) Which brings us to this week, oh my, now it&apos;s the 
 hundreds of takings lawsuits that may result from people on No Name who 
 sold out to the county because they were told that there would never be 
 electricity there. Especially now, since the County Attorney&apos;s have 
 agreed that No Name should never have had power denied to residents in 
 the first place this just opens the floodgates to millions in takings 
 cases. As a taxpayer, that is a potential bummer. But not anywhere 
 near as bad as the NNK Galleon Bay takings lawsuit that the county lost 
 for about $10 million dollars. We don&apos;t even know how much more than 
 that amount because the commissioners close the door when they talk 
 about that. Hey Steve, how comes you never mention Galleon Bay?? Since 
 we the taxpayers are going to pay for that private park at the end of No 
 Name Drive, I recommend that we all start using it as we see fit. Maybe someone should start organizing picnics and community events 
 there, its really pretty, drive down and take a look at what your 
 taxpayer money bought just so that ex-Monroe planning commissioner 
 didn&apos;t have to have neighbors.   And so, we look forward to the next issue of the News 
 Barometer as Mr. Estes continues to spin the real story, pervert the 
 real data, and ignore the 70% majority of homeowners whose opinions 
 differ from his .

 Is there a policy I can get to cover that? [No Name Key 
 Electric]- great reply- obviously Tim does not get it- he must be fresh 
 out of school and running on pure idealistic ideas. No Name is a

 Either outlaw home generation if you really are serious about the 
 environment or let these people tie into the grid. Any other solution 
 makes absolutely no sense. I hope I wasn&apos;t this stupid when I first got 
 out of school, but maybe I was. [Can&apos;t the fish just dive to a

 Secretary Napolitano Designates 11 New Countries as 
 Eligible for H-2a and H-2b Nonimmigrant Visa Programs 
  Release Date: January 22, 2010 For Immediate 
 Release Office of the Press Secretary Contact: 202-282-8010 
 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet 
 Napolitano this week designated 11 new countries as eligible to 
 participate in the H-2A and H-2B nonimmigrant visa programs, which allow 
 U.S. employers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill 
 temporary or seasonal jobs for which U.S. workers are not available. 

 The 11 newly designated countriesCroatia, Ecuador, 
 Ethiopia, Ireland, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, 
 Serbia, Slovakia and Uruguayjoin 28 countries previously designated as 
 eligible to participate in these programs. 

 The initial lists of participating countries for the 
 H-2A and H-2B programspublished in December 2008expired on Jan. 17 and 
 18, respectively. After consulting with Secretary of State Hillary 
 Clinton, Secretary Napolitano determined that the 11 newly designated 
 countries meet the standards required for participation in the H-2A and 
 H-2B programs. The new combined list was published Monday in the Federal 
 Register. 

 On a case-by-case basis, DHS may allow a worker from a 
 country not on the participating country list to be eligible for the 
 H-2A or H-2B program if such participation is in the interest of the 
 United States.

 MITIGATION: A RIPOFF OR A MACHINATION 

 I 
 could be missing the point. Keys politics are enough to give a citizen 
 a mental hernia. I read that the county could possibly be faced with 
 huge mitigation costs to run sewer pipes as mandated and proposed, yet 
 not completely planned and approved, to the satisfaction of many, both 
 homeowner and county officials. It seems new obstacles spring up faster 
 than a knee can jerk. As the situation is described in the January 15, 
 2010 Barometer , a two foot wide temporary ditch required to bury 
 a 3 to 5 pipe running alongside existing roads, albeit possibly, 
 but barely, encroaching on Wildlife Preserve land calls for 
 reimbursement beyond the countys ability to pay. Why, pray, are there 
 any mitigation costs at all? There is no damage to the habitat, and a 
 month later there will be no evidence a pipeline lies beneath indigenous 
 growth? Is this a tempest in a tea pot, a misunderstanding of the 
 purpose of protecting habit lands, a potential rip-off of the 
 beleaguered countys attempt to serve the people and others agencies, 
 real or imagined? Based on previous delays, it could be a stalling 
 machination looking for an in-house excuse to, for out-house sewer 
 gerrymandering? It is so hard to tell. America_Rising.wmv (6676KB) Utah in 3D Utah3D.Net 360 Degree Spherical Panoramas by Martin van Hemert     Prior

 written three books you sure don&apos;t know much. Let me help you out a bit 
 to get you up to speed.   I am concerned about the welfare of the entire County, especially our 
 ecosystem and what is best for planet after we are long gone. Not just 
 No Name, nope, but the whole place. I am also concerned about our 
 democracy being well run, honestly and intelligently. In Monroe County 
 these things are, shall we say, very challenging concerns.   For a self described smart guy you sure sound dumb. The power estimate 
 is $ 690,000. I&apos;d stop using the Citizen as your &apos;source&apos;. The $ 690,000 
 comes from the power company. The fact that Mayor Smurphy &apos;heard the 
 same number&apos; makes the entire point of all of this. ALL of it. Not only 
 does Smurphy not care about the facts, the issues and certainly not No 
 Name, she has zero capacity to read or listen. She has been provided, as 
 has every pertinent staff person and every member of the BOCC and most 
 certainly The Key West Citizen the facts. Now it&apos;s possible your own 
 recollection about the cost of power was simply dated, the cost has come 
 down a lot in the last year or two. It is, however, nearly impossible to 
 believe the Mayor understands, follows or cares about any of the 
 details. They (the BOCC, staff and others) have all been provided the 
 facts and figures about power many, many times. Not from residents but 
 the power company. If they care to govern and use the facts then they 
 have and know the facts.    That&apos;s the point Sloan. Your government, mine, should assist all 
 citizens. They should listen. They should help not hurt. Especially when 
 an ultra clear majority speak in unison. Is that not the American way? 
 The democratic way? Even more so when your fellow Americans present a 
 compelling set of facts that hurt exactly no one, help most and 
 perhaps most importantly, help the environment. Forget No Name, apply 
 that logic to any issue you like and in doing so ask yourself why your 
 fellow neighbors are ridiculed, lied to, overlooked. This is not about 
 No Name, it&apos;s about the way business is done in a small community like 
 the Keys where long time relationships, bias and, sadly, people being 
 mislead are so harmful. That needs to stop.   Glad you guessed right on the 30. That&apos;s 70%. The actual number is 
 higher but some don&apos;t want to publicly say they favor or want power for 
 fear that the one or two true zealots against the idea will beat them 
 down (and based on what I see and hear, they would suffer if they 
 expressed their honest view/intentions). So the figure is 75% (or more) 
 of the community. Yes. And yes, how about this, your former Mayor made those who want power sign and have notarized an affidavit 
 stating that they want power and will pay for it. And, before you ask, 
 yes the entire BOCC knows this, so does the Citizen, County staff, the 
 power company. So Sloan, since you are a self professed real estate 
 expert, tell all of us readers how many times in your supposedly 
 impressive career you have ever heard or seen a community humiliated 
 over something as unremarkable as wanting power y being required to sign 
 and have notarized an affidavit. Have you, yourself, ever been made to 
 sign such a document. Me thinks not. Of course not. But your fellow 
 Americans on No Name were made to do this to prove they wanted power, 
 that he majority was in favor of this and would pay for it.    How they pay for it is frankly none of your business. I suggest pennies. 
 Lots and lots of pennies. By the case load. For such a supposedly BIG 
 man of life and business even asking shows how small you really are. How 
 do you pay your bills? Your question is a perfect example of how the 
 long time No Namers have gotten hurt and humiliated for so long.    And finally, as to &apos;rights&apos;, there is no prohibition against power. As 
 long as residents pay for it, and they will/can/want to, the power 
 company is allowed to bring it to their homes. The County Attorney says 
 so. The Assistant County Attorney says so. The power company says so. 
 The law says so. The people who bought there 40 years ago, 30 years ago, 
 anyone who bought before Ms. Putney did her dirty work expected power, 
 sought power, were promised power.   Ms. Putney has, for 20 years tried to change that by working nearly full 
 time to steal from her neighbors, has done truly evil things behind 
 their backs because she and a handful, clearly 30% or less, don&apos;t want 
 power. That is the women&apos;s right of course, to think that way and she 
 certainly need not connect when the poles are on No Name. Easy solution 
 to not wanting it, just don&apos;t connect.   But over her 20 years there she has stolen her neighbor&apos;s rights. As an 
 activist she got herself appointed as a Planning Commissioner. While in 
 that position, in 2001, she got herself named as the named Defendant in 
 the lawsuit over power on No Name. And then it gets better (or worse if 
 you live there, or for that matter believe in honesty and ethics in your 
 government). While a Planning Commissioner and the Defendant in that 
 lawsuit she then wrote a local Ordinance prohibiting power on No Name 
 (as well as central sewer, potable water, telephone etc). Now, let&apos;s 
 review, the woman lives on the island, while on the Commission she asks 
 to be the Defendant in a lawsuit over power and she also writes a local 
 law against among other things power. No surprise, course, that she 
 lobbied he BOCC to pass her Ordinance, nor that she herself voted for 
 it. Nope, no ethics there, no thought or movement to recuse herself 
 since the lawsuit or proposed law was about her own neighborhood or 
 would impact her own neighbors. Sloan, you following me here bro? In my 
 America Sloan that person would recuse themselves from the issue from 
 the start, not write a law, vote for it, lobby for it. What this County 
 allowed is despicable and wrong and stole the right of those longest on 
 No Name as well as part of their lives and peace of mind.    The good news is that this will be, must be, corrected. Not only because 
 people there want a very basic service but because the evil that has 
 happened there must be corrected. None of us should celebrate or 
 advocate how those long time residents were and are treated. It is 
 simply against every grain of what America is, or should be. We must be 
 better than what was done there.    As to you my friend, my experience in life is that those that most 
 loudly blow their own horn either have a reason to do so or a very small 
 horn that they want to seem larger than it is. As they say in Texas, &apos; Big 
 Hat, No Cattle&apos; . For all of your self touted experience and 
 expertise you sure sound and write as if you are stupid. You are, of 
 course, entitled to your opinion but it might be nice to get your facts 
 right, at least once in a while, even if your view differs from mine.  A jobless recovery,they still don&apos;t get it. Government does not make 
 anything. Nothing. They take form the folks that have made stuff. Government 
 workers are among the highest paid folks around.We are so top heavy we are 
 about to tip over. Our President has only given money and jobs to more 
 government based programs and special interest groups...Great to help him 
 get re-elected but not so good for our country.Everyone can not work for 
 the government,it just won&apos;t work.. Hating people is like burning down your house to get rid of a rat. The From Das Riech guy is on the road again looking for a Farmer&apos;s 
 Market.

On a more serious note I have a question for Deer Ed . I seem to 
 recall that Sloan used to pay for his space on the CT, does he still do 
 that? Does the From Das Riech guy also pay the CT for the privilege of 
 boring us on a daily basis? Inquiring minds want to know! 
 More bar wisdom. If you drink in the morning, you&apos;re an alcoholic. If you drink 
 in the morning near an athletic facility, you&apos;re a fan. 
   Question:&quot;What does the Bible say about 
 managing your finances?&quot;

Answer: The Bible has a lot to say about managing finances. 
 Concerning borrowing, the Bible generally advises against it. See 
 Proverbs 6:1-5; 20:16; 22:7, 26-27 (The rich rule over the poor, and 
 the borrower is servant to the lender.... Do not be a man who strikes 
 hands in pledge or puts up security for debts; if you lack the means to 
 pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you). Over and over 
 again, the Bible warns against the accumulation of wealth and encourages 
 us to seek spiritual riches instead. Proverbs 28:20: A faithful man 
 will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go 
 unpunished. See also Proverbs 10:15; 11:4; 18:11; 23:5.

Proverbs 6:6-11 offers wisdom concerning laziness and the financial ruin 
 that inevitably results. We are told to consider the industrious ant who 
 works to store up food for itself. The passage also warns against 
 sleeping when we should be working at something profitable. A sluggard 
 is a lazy, slothful person who would rather rest than work. His end is 
 assuredpoverty and want. At the other end of the spectrum is the one 
 who is obsessed with gaining money. Such a one, according to 
 Ecclesiastes 5:10, never has enough wealth to satisfy him and must be 
 constantly grasping more and more. First Timothy 6:6-11 also warns 
 against the trap of desiring wealth.

Rather than desiring to heap riches upon ourselves, the biblical model 
 is one of giving, not getting. Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly 
 will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap 
 generously. Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to 
 give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful 
 giver (2 Corinthians 9:6-7). We are also encouraged to be good stewards 
 of what God has given us. In Luke 16:1-13, Jesus told the parable of the 
 dishonest steward as a way of warning us against poor stewardship. The 
 moral of the story is So if you have not been trustworthy in handling 
 worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? (v. 11). We are 
 also responsible to provide for our own household, as 1 Timothy 5:8 
 reminds us: If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and 
 especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is 
 worse than an unbeliever.

In summary, what does the Bible say about managing money? The answer can 
 be summarized with a single wordwisdom. We are to be wise with our 
 money. We are to save money, but not hoard it. We are to spend money, 
 but with discretion and control. We are to give back to the Lord, 
 joyfully and sacrificially. We are to use our money to help others, but 
 with discernment and the guidance of Gods Spirit. It is not wrong to be 
 rich, but it is wrong to love money. It is not wrong to be poor, but it 
 is wrong to waste money on trivial things. The Bibles consistent 
 message on managing money is to be wise. If you need financial help, you 
 can inquire more through Christian Financial Concepts http://www.crown.org . Sloan on No Name Electric I was not aware 
 those 30 want to pay the entire cost. Nor, from what I&apos;ve heard, does the 
 County Commission know that.


C&apos;mon Sloan. You&apos;re better than that. You go to the meetings, or watch 
 them on tv, and read the papers. How can you say that?



Sorry Sloan,&quot;what you&apos;ve heard&quot;is flat out wrong, and indicates that 
 you need to do more research, collect more facts, before opining. Why you 
 are participating in the spinning (spreading dis-information) going on about 
 NNK.



I&apos;ve personally been to at least 3 BOCC meetings during which people from

NNK have told the BOCC they will pay for it 100% themselves. And in at

least 4 different newspaper articles, I have read that same statement. I 
 don&apos;t live there, or have any interest in the outcome.To me, the NNK 
 situation is nothing personal, but even I can refute your statements.



And I absolutely don&apos;t want to incur your acerbic verbiage, so I&apos;ll stop 
 here. Trama Star] How can our County government 
 allow these greedy, opportunistic, parasites to turn a tragedy into tragedy, 
 plus financial devastation?




Government allow ??!! What rock have you been living under? It&apos;s the 
 Monroe County Government that&apos;s doing it!! Those greedy, opportunistic, 
 parasites are called the Board of County Commissioners, and their names are 
 Mayor Murphy, Commissioners George Neugent, Heather Carruthers, Kim 
 Wigington, and

Mario DeGennaro.

Obviously you don&apos;t know this - the county owns and operates that 
 helicopter courtesy of Monroe County property owning taxpayers.



And last October/November, Fire Chief Callahan stood up at a publicly 
 broadcast BOCC meeting and announced his new plan - that Trauma Star is FREE 
 for County residents. So are you a full-time county resident? If so, call 
 him and ask him why you&apos;re being strong-armed into paying for something 
 you&apos;re supposed to get for free.



And oh, you&apos;re welcome - because if it&apos;s free to you , or you can&apos;t pay

your bill, it will be paid for you by all (yes,all,regardless of what 
 they tell the public) the property owning taxpayers in Monroe County. I 
 never met you, but now I&apos;m responsible via my taxes for paying for your 
 helicopter ride.





And the insult is that your Medicare which pays a portion of that bill is 
 also my tax money - what I gave to the feds.

SO - Monroe County property owning taxpayers and everybody who pays their 
 federal taxes, will be paying for your ride.





Me, as the person who&apos;s really going to pay that bill - because you can&apos;t

afford to pay it and you&apos;re going to tell the county that - bitch about

the inflatedness of that bill. The county bean counters have puffed up 
 that

bill by at least 30% for a cushion to cover their other expenses.



Because, you see, the county still has to pay salaries, insurance, fuel,

equipment expenses, regardless if it ever leaves the ground or ever turns

a rotor. FYI - within the next 2 years, Trauma Star will be unavailable

for at least a total of 12 weeks for routine maintenance, and special

federally mandated safety upgrades. Ana another FYI, Trauma Star was down 
 (out

of service) for 4 days to fix things, and nobody died because it was not

available. And why is that? Because we have what we always had -2 other

helicopter companies available to respond.



So what&apos;s this really about? Simple, 2 things, money and influence. Same

old typical Monroe County MO.

1 - Protecting county employees in the Trauma Star portion, so they don&apos;t

lose their county jobs. Except they won&apos;t because they can go back to

being regular fire-rescue employees, just like the rest of the county&apos;s

fire-rescue people. But, wait, guess what, the people who work Trauma 
 Star get

paid more than the rest of the fire-rescue people.

2 - It&apos;s a convoluted form of who&apos;s friends with who, who believes what

their friends are saying instead of the facts the public presents, and

although this is speculation, somebody owes political favor(s).





Of course, I&apos;ll very glad that you&apos;re well enough to sit at a keyboard 
 and

communicate about your bill.



From now on, I want to see you at the next BOCC monthly meeting. It&apos;s

time for you to pay attention to what else the county is doing with our

money. We&apos;ll sit together.



I&apos;m easy to find. I&apos;m the one standing in front of the BOCC at their

Marathon and Key Largo meetings saying that the county must stop funding

Trauma Star, because continuing to fund it will eventually bankrupt 
 Monroe

County property owning taxpayers.



I always start out my speaking with the same sentence:I am not against a

medical helicopter. I am against the taxpayers having to pay for it.

Because we have 2 other private medical helicopters available. Re: Gun control guy. Geez.... why don&apos;t you 
 just f**k your gun already? There&apos;s been no talk during this administration 
 about gun control. You are an alarmist, and a douche. Once again Sloan is&quot;right on&quot;concerning No 
 Name Key. I hope he keeps reporting about the power grab going on.
His is 
 the only posting that tells the truth. Keep up the good work. first 
 documented photo of a deer being strangled to death by a 12 foot Burmese 
 python and 14 other photos to its web page of pythons recently observed, 
 captured or killed. I think that a haunting feeling of guilt over some 
 past deeds and a need to atone for them can result in a great outpouring 
 of good works for the benefit of others as exemplified by Ted Kennedy&apos;s 
 work in Congress. 
 
 The 
 immediate future will be fascinating to watch. Background: Mr. Obama 
 has just had his political head handed to him by the steamroller win 
 of Brown. Im told that Brown won with a higher percentage of Mass 
 voters that did Obama over McCain. Brown played Obama like a bone 
 fish, he succeded in making the entire contest a referendum on Mr. 
 Obama. Mr. Obama was even suckered into personally campaigning for 
 Coakley. Mr. Obama&apos;s street creds have suffered huge damage in the 
 savaging that he took from a common man rookie. Review: Mr.Obama&apos;s 
 first promise was to close GITMO; its still open. Obama promised 
 transparency in Govt; He lied. Obama promised to fix what he called 
 the mess of Iran and the war on terror; All he has done is follow 
 Mr. Bushs plan, every twist and turn of it. His Congressional 
 henchmen are burned out: they want the whole mess to just go away. 
 They want a rest. Theres more, but enough for now. Yesterday, he 
 gave a real stump winder fight, fight, fight, campaign speech. While 
 saying this is not about me, he managed to give a speech that was 
 as all about him. The speech was as chock full of Ay, Ay, AY, Ay as 
 one of his pal Kanye Wests raps. You really should check it out 
 at: http://www.metrolyrics.com/ay-ay-ay-lyrics-kanye-west.html . 
 Wests rap is worth reading, it summarizes Mr. Obamas speech. 
 Unbelievably some of Mr. Obamas inner circle is claiming that the 
 Brown win was really a win for Obama. These bubble heads are saying 
 that the crash of Obamacare was a massive screw up by his 
 Congressional trench fighters. Mr. Obama would have you believe 
 that his Congressional fighters just did not fight hard enough.. He 
 refuses to acknowledge that most Americans hated the bill. His 
 cosmic ego is simply incapable of acknowledging that his charisma 
 cannot always win. Mr. Obama seems to be constitutionally unable to 
 admit error. He blames everyone but himself. He has managed to 
 severely piss off both the radical progressive/liberal side of his 
 party, as well as the more centrist true believers. The long knives 
 are out of the sheaths, you can hear the swoosh as they cut the air, 
 and the snick as they impact. The blood is beginning to splatter the 
 Washington walls. Please pass the Orange Pekoe.

 Friday  January

 [ Trama 
 Star ] Here is what you can expect if you get sick and cannot be 
 treated in Key West. This is my actual bill. Your insurance or Medicaid 
 will only cover a small portion of this bill and the patient will be 
 billed the balance. How can our County government allow these greedy, 
 opportunistic, parasites to turn a tragedy into tragedy, plus financial 
 devastation? Try to justify $24,000 for a 50 minute ride to Miami. 
 [ No Name Key Electric ] Over the past couple days I 
 have read several quotes about No Name Key that I find almost amusing. In Tim O&apos;Hara&apos;s last Citizen article he begins with this,&quot;NNK 
 has become a model community for off-grid living&quot;, and just yesterday 
 in the Coco Tele&quot;why would anyone want to ruin an environmental 
 paradise&quot;. I have to ask myself over and over, do these people just not get it? 

 Dear Tim, Are you kidding me? Model community? Have you 
 researched the implications for off grid living in Florida? Do you not 
 hear that there are 30+ diesel generators running on a daily basis 
 there? That you listen to generators 24/7, smell their fumes, feel 
 their vibrations, see them emitting toxic air pollutants. That on 
 cloudy or rainy days, at night, you are left with whatever is in your 
 batteries to power your homes and that this supply dwindles the minute 
 the sun goes down. That you can&apos;t realistically run A/C on solar, you 
 need the generators or a grid back up or you pack up and head north for 
 6 months of the year. 

 If Tim was a real journalist, he would do research that 
 would show that off grid living in Florida and in many parts of the US 
 is completely unrealistic. Just try to find an off-grid community 
 anywhere. The fact of the matter is that if solar power is to go 
 big-time, the only realistic means will be in a grid-tie setting. It is 
 more energy efficient, cleaner and greener than having the island laden 
 with dirty, CO2 emitting generators that people use daily. Unfortunately it is clear to most that Tim&apos;s problem is that he is so 
 closely linked to the anti-electricity group that he refuses to look at 
 and present the real facts of the solar energy story. 

 All the islands in the Keys are beautiful. Get off US1 
 and drive to upper Sugarloaf, Cudjoe, Torches, etc. Get out of your car 
 and walk around, ride your bikes down the trails. They all rival No 
 Name in beauty. What you won&apos;t see on these other islands are two 
 active quarries that are dynamiting and hauling away NNK by the 
 truckload every day. Go sit by the bridge at 6am when they start 
 rumbling by and count them. What I don&apos;t understand is how you can call 
 someplace a paradise when the people have been forced (illegally, I 
 might add) to generate electricity in possibly the most polluting manner 
 possible. You people need to do some research on what grid-tie 
 electricity is and how environmentally beneficial it could be to this&quot;island paradise&quot;.  

 Open your minds to the fact that grid-tie is the future 
 of solar power in the US, in Florida and in the Keys.  To attempt to 
 keep NNK trapped in 1970&apos;s solar technology is to prevent this island 
 from ever becoming the island paradise that you are seeking. 
 [ Sloan 
 on No Name Electric ] Although you use a&quot; keysconcerns &quot;email handle, it looks to me that your concerns are isolated to No Name 
 Key homeowners, including yourself, who bought off the grid with eyes 
 wide open, and now want on the grid.
 
The $900,000 above ground estimate for electricity to No Name Key 
 homes was reported in KW Citizen . Sylvia Murphy was not the 
 original source for me, but she had heard the same number. Of course, 
 the final cost estimates are what they are. The lower the cost, the 
 better for No Name Key residents who want power. And water. If it 
 happens.
 
I was not aware there were 30 homeowners on No Name Key who wanted power 
 and water run out there. I picked 30 out of the air in my earlier post, 
 for the sake of having a number to work with.
 
I was not aware those 30 want to pay the entire cost. Nor, from what 
 I&apos;ve heard, does the County Commission know that.
 
If there are 30 homeowners who have agreed to pay the entire cost, is 
 there something in writing from them, signed by each of them, agreeing 
 to pay the cost?
 
If so, do they agree in writing to pay the entire cost up front? Are 
 they willing and able to put the cost into escrow, to guarantee past and 
 future work done by the Aqueduct Authority, Keys Energy and County staff 
 on their behalf is fully reimbursed?
 
People who built/ purchased homes on No Name Key have the same legal 
 rights now that they had when the homes were built/purchased. Won&apos;t 
 surprise me if a local court decides what those rights are. Won&apos;t 
 surprise me that whatever the court decides, there is an appeal. Maybe a 
 few years later we will have a final legal ruling. And it won&apos;t surprise 
 me if the loser has to pay the winner&apos;s litigation costs.
 
Please do not take any of the above as my consent to electricity and 
 water being run out to No Name Key. I oppose it totally. You and the 
 other 29 knew there was no electricity or water on No Name Key, when you 
 made it your home. You knew the restrictions in effect. Either you 
 later had a change of heart, or you had an agenda all along to speculate 
 that you could get power and water out there and profit from your 
 speculation. Either way, I don&apos;t feel sympathetic. http://goodmorningfloridakeys.com/?cat=3

Government Flow Chart 
 [ Party Crashers ] The dynamic Salahi duo, aka The 
 White House party crashers, faced down a Congressional investigation. 
 They invoked their Fifth Amendment right more than 25 times frustrating, 
 upsetting and pissing off some angry lawmakers. Now the bastards know 
 how we feel trying to get answers to questions about their stupid 
 legislative actions. All was not lost as a picture was shown of the 
 President meeting the couple as they entered the party. 
 [ Burmese 
 Python ] According to the FWC there is a low risk of a human being 
 attacked by a Burmese python. They mostly feed on mammals, birds and 
 reptiles--most of the time. The FWC recommends that if you do locate one 
 of these deadly alien snakes that you contact them to have it 
 relocated? Does this low risk also apply to the aggressive African 
 rock python thats hanging around your back yard watching your cat, dog 
 or kid? Pythons are constrictors, killing their prey by suffocation 
 rather than with venom. They do this by first biting the victim to 
 establish a grip, then wrapping several coils around its body and 
 squeezing tighter and tighter each time the victim exhales until the 
 victim can no longer breathe. The snake then swallows the meal whole, 
 usually headfirst. 

 Im not 
 exactly sure how they measure low risk as compared to high risk. Is that 
 2 out of 10? Most of the documented human attacks by pythons involve the 
 snake&apos;s owner or immediate family. If youre not a python owner I guess 
 this is more good news. They dont say anything about the undocumented 
 attacks. How would they know how many undocumented attacks there were? 
 Low risk, high risk, documented or undocumented, this all seems like a 
 lot of double talk from over paid, under worked government employees. If 
 your child or pet is found inside the belly of a 16 foot, 155 pound 
 python will the FWC then raise the risk level from low to medium or 
 high? It is only a matter of time for something tragic like this to 
 happen in the Keys. 

 I recently 
 read that it is recommended that you should keep your garage door closed 
 to stop these deadly constricting snakes from entering. I would have to 
 add that you should probably keep your bedroom sliding glass doors 
 closed. If I encounter one of these giant deadly snakes Ill probably 
 shit my pants and then Ill either shoot it dead on the spot or 
 decapitate it with a machete. Then Ill call the FWC to have it 
 relocated or maybe just turn it into a nice pair of snake skin boots. 
 
 The situation in Haiti is heartbreaking. So sad

 [ The 
 Real Miss America ] This 19 year old ex-cheerleader (now an Air Force Security Forces 
 Sniper) was watching a road that led to a NATO military base when she 
 observed a man digging by the road. She engaged the target (i.e., she 
 shot him). It turned out he was a bomb maker for the Taliban, and he was 
 burying an IED that was to be detonated when a US patrol walked by

 [ No 
 Name Key Electric ] All of the homes on No Name Key actually run off of lead-acid batteries, 
 not solar: In reality, we are battery homes, or the battery island. 
 The only question then becomes how one charges these lead-acid batteries 
 which run and operate each and every home: The batteries are charge by 
 either solar or generators. 

 The sun doesn&apos;t shine every day, nor does it shine 24 hours a day, and 
 power requirements (loads on the house) differ throughout the year. I 
 do not, repeat not have central a/c. I live here year-round (this is my 
 only home), I have one small window unit in my bedroom in which to take 
 refuge from the summer heat. I have the 5th largest solar system on 
 this island, yet I still rely heavily on generators to charge the 
 lead-acid batteries that run my home, and I cannot run central a/c from 
 my system.  

 The two homes here that probably have the largest solar system do run 
 central a/c, but they do so from their generators. You see, to run 
 central a/c solar doesnt cut it, not even for these homes with their 
 extraordinarily large ($60,000.00!!) solar arrays. Neighbors report 
 diesel or gasoline fuel bills in the $500.00 - $700.00 range all summer 
 long. That&apos;s a lot of fossil fuels burning out here! 

 My home usually produces more energy than I need during the winter 
 months, and not enough in the summer (remember, the angle of the sun 
 changes throughout the year, but my house does not).  Also, solar 
 panels do not like excessive heat; they are less effective in the 
 summer. Even without the luxury of central a/c ( again, I don&apos;t have 
 that ), my house requires more power in the summer (appliances such 
 as fridge/freezer work harder in the heat, and the temp. inside my home 
 is often in the upper 80s low 90s throughout the summer). My power 
 requirements in the summer are also increased by other things such as my 
 need to run fans (which draw a lot of power, even my&quot;energy star&quot;fans).  

 The reality of solar is that it is either feast or famine. I either 
 have too much energy, and without grid-tie, no place to send my excess; 
 or I cant produce enough and must run generators to keep my house 
 functioning. 

 Generators produce 300% more CO2 emissions that electricity produced 
 from Florida grid electric. 

 Either way you look at it: Pollution or waste is not green. No Name Key 
 is not green. One cannot run generators, and waste energy, and call 
 themselves&quot;green&quot;. Grid-tie is the only true sustainable green 
 solution.

 [From the 
 Right ] The UNs top climate researcher has 
 revealed that he/she is a hermaphrodite who has had repeated sexual 
 liaisons with Tiger Woods. None of that is true, but if it were, it sure 
 would be one hell of a story. There is even a bigger story that you 
 probably havent yet seen. And this story is true! One of the very 
 biggest building blocks of the man-caused-global-warming myth has been 
 the forecast of the total melt of the Himalaya glaciers by 2035. If that 
 were to come to pass, it would be a catastrophic problem for the world. 
 Thank God, that it is not true. Yesterday the UNs top climate change 
 prophet issued a reluctant and unprecedented apology over its own much 
 ballyhooed but false, prediction that Himalayan glaciers were doomed. The report containing the dire (but false) forecast won a Nobel Prize, 
 the same prize won by Mr. Obama and Mr. Gore. That is a whole other 
 story. The Cap and Trade crowd has relied on the melting glacier 
 falsehood as a critical selling point to push its globalist agenda. Preaching the gospel of glacier melting has become one of the sacraments 
 of the MCGW tea and toast crowd. Its absolutely incredible, but the UN 
 now tells us that the whole stinking mess stems from a false newspaper 
 story published 11 years ago. So we have had 11 years of false 
 information influencing our decision makers and impacting our lives. Yesterdays blockbuster has not yet made it to US news outlets, and its 
 possible that they will choose not to air it because it reveals their 
 deep prejudices. It shows them to be bozos, and it wreaks havoc on their 
 agenda.. Our media has again been shown to be institutional Henny 
 Penneys that are scurrying about screeching The sky is falling, the 
 sky is falling. This is only the latest blow to the credibility of the 
 man-caused-global-warming brigands. Nope, this story isnt about Tiger 
 getting screwed; its about you getting screwed. 

 (Part II-On 
 the road) Tucson is a very comfortable city. Its people are warm and 
 friendly and the ring of peaks that rises around the city is 
 breathtaking. The community is neat and clean, and the people are very 
 friendly. But its cold, really cold. Of special interest are public 
 works projects, they are head and shoulder above what Ive seen 
 elsewhere. The steep sides of cuts into hills for roadways are finished 
 with a concrete wall that is carefully constructed to mimic the nearby 
 surroundings. They even inset rocks and what appear to be soils in order 
 to replicate layers of sediment. The drive from Tucson to Phoenix was 
 pretty boring until the truck ahead suddenly disappears into the leading 
 edge of a sand storm kicked up by 50 mph winds. It was really bizarre, 
 the rear of the semi was fairly visible from my following distance of 
 about 100 feet, but the rest of the truck was gone, it was swallowed up 
 by a wall of tan sand and dust. We had been cautioned that if that were 
 to occur, we should immediately drive off the road and to get onto the 
 desert floor, pull away as far as possible from the road, then 
 immediately turn off the lights so as not to be a magnet for other cars. 
 I turned right about 30 degrees and headed into the pucker brush. I 
 immediately saw at least 15 other cars within a few feet of us, all shut 
 down, all without lights. The leading edge of the storm is truly like 
 an opaque tan blanket, the loss of visibility is sudden. The storm 
 lasted for about 30 minutes then it let up enough to be able to head 
 back onto the road.  

 Before getting 
 on the road again we talked to one of the locals. He said that he had 
 heard from a local prospector that in the high reaches of the Santa 
 Catalina Mountains, north of Tucson, they have found a colony of little 
 brass Arctic penguins that the University folks claim have migrated in 
 so as to avoid having their little brass nads frozen off by global 
 warming.

 [ Buy American ] When it comes to cars you have to 
 do some research. A lot of foreign products are actually far more 
 American than many American cars. For example, the Toyota Sienna is 
 the second most American vehicle made/assembled in the USA with 85% 
 American made parts. Only one car does better than that; the Ford 
 Taurus. Many products from Chrysler, Ford and GM are made in other 
 countries with substantial portions of their parts also made elsewhere. 
 Buying one of them may make you think youre buying American, but the 
 only Americans youre helping may be the senior executives of the 
 company. Im far more concerned about employing American workers than 
 worrying about which CEO gets the bonus. 
 [ The 
 First Amendment ] I have a right as a citizen of this Country to 
 express my religious beliefs in the United States Post Office. Jesus 
 still loves all of you and I will be back to the Post Office in Big Pine

 another Post Office if I was going to&quot;Push religion&quot;or talk about God 
 and Jesus. It is my right to do so whether you like it or not. God be 
 with you! 

 If you read 
 the Holy Bible with an open mind and ask Jesus to forgive you of your 
 sins and come into your life, he will do so. It is Jesus that will give 
 you peace and help to subdue your anger. From what I have read, the 
 United States Postal Service has anger management classes for employees 
 who have issues with anger. I have forgiven this person for not handling 
 anger appropriately, but I am also concerned for the well being of this 
 person. You are forgiven, but I will continue to express myself and my 
 beliefs. When someone approaches me with anger, I respond with Jesus. 
 That does not make me a hypocrite. It makes me a witness for Christ and 
 his Kingdom. 

 Next time I 
 come to the Post Office, I will be singing Jesus loves me. If someone is 
 angry for this, they are not angry with me, but angry with God. God is 
 happy with me and I bring glory to him for standing up for him and being 
 his witness. I will never back down and I will stand firm on solid 
 ground. Solid as a rock and I will practice my freedom of religion and 
 speech anywhere and everywhere I go.

 are also many foreign cars that are largely assembled here by American

 not mean that the majority of the profits are staying here. I say buy 
 what suits you best and do your home work. I own three GM cars, while 
 two are predominantly of US origin one is almost all of foreign origin.

 [ Democrats 
 lumped together as Liberals ] You bet they are! During 8 years of 
 vile Bush policy and personal attacks including outrageous anti Bush 
 protests, your party clearly defined itself. As mass demonstrations 
 openly called for the president&apos;s death, all Democrats bathed in his 
 dropping poles, national chaos and said nothing to stop the hate. 
 Nothing! 

 No Democrat lawmakers were outraged, opposed or spoke out 
 against their left&apos;s psycho rhetoric and actions. Democrats became The 
 Party of Hate. The left, middle and right became united in a common 
 cause. A no-holds-bared party cause and suicide mission to destroy Bush. 
 Any and all methods to accomplish that objective were on the table. The 
 continuing BS story about&quot; Oh the left of our party doesn&apos;t really 
 represent all Democrats &quot;was proven to be one big lie. 

 The left will always be to the Democratic party - what 
 the hit man is to the mob. The failure of any Democrats to speak up and 
 condemn the left&apos;s actions sent a very clear message to America. 
 Democrats will never ridicule or challenge anything the left does. They 
 continually fail to see any problem with the left&apos;s methods or actions 
 because they are afraid of them. The multi branch party of double 
 standards became united under one just cause: Destroy GW Bush by any 
 means necessary, including calling for his death. 

 The fact Democrats would never stay silent if Republican 
 protesters openly demanded Obama&apos;s death, while hanging him in effigy 
 than setting it on fire, seals the case on their double standard. 
 Democrats are a party of One. No amount of spin can ever undue that! (Ed: Weve received three death threats for 
 Obama. The most recent was on Monday.)

 there was a school on NNK, and there is one mentioned online and that in 
 1919 there were 28 children enrolled in a school there.   Between 1928 
 and 1938 there was a ferry service between No Name Key and Lower 
 Matecumbe Key. The 40 mile trip took four hours.  If you missed the 
 ferry, it says you could spend the night at the No Name Lodge. Mr. 
 Wilkinson even includes numerous black and white photos.  Back in the

 [ Big 
 snakes poised to change U.S. ecosystems by Michael Tennesen] Brought 
 to the U.S. as pets, Burmese pythons have made headlines with their 
 uncontrolled spread in the Florida Everglades and willingness to 
 challenge alligators for the position of top predator. A report released 
 by the U.S. Geological Survey last fall delivered more bad news: two 
 other constrictor species, also former pets, are thriving in the area, 
 and six others could pose similar threats. Researchers fear that 
 reproductive populations could spread and eat native animals into 
 extinction. 

 The new interlopersnorthern 
 and southern African pythons, reticulated pythons, boa constrictors and 
 four species of anacondashave&quot;ecological similarities,&quot;explains 
 Robert Reed, a USGS biologist and one of the authors of the report.&quot;They are large invasive predators that native birds and mammals arent 
 adapted to, and they are highly fecund, capable of producing up to 100 
 hatchlings in one nest.&quot;Theyre also big; some grow up to 20 feet and 
 200 pounds. They seize prey with their teeth and then wrap around the 
 preys body, squeezing it to death. 

 Biologists first noticed the 
 slithering invasion in the late 1990s. Snake numbers have risen 
 dramatically: in 2000 two Burmese pythons were captured in the 
 Everglades National Park; in 2008 the number captured hit 343. 
 Biologists believe that tens of thousands now live in the park. Other 
 constrictors have begun appearing beyond the Everglades: boa 
 constrictors south of Miami and African pythons just west of the city. 

 Cryptic by nature, constrictors 
 are extremely difficult to capture.&quot;We know how they move and what they 
 look like,&quot;says USGS biologist Kristen Hart.&quot;We had a radio-tagged 
 snake in a fenced-off area the other day, right in the middle of six of 
 us, and yet we couldnt even see it. They are often underground or 
 underwater or in a tree. They blend in so well here in the Everglades.&quot; 

 When they move, however, they 
 can move far. Relocated pythons have demonstrated a homing ability, 
 returning up to 48 miles to the place where they were captured. 
 Biologists worry that the reptiles may populate the Florida Keys, 
 perhaps by riding on floating logs or even swimming the distance. 

 Without native predators, the 
 snakes could really thrive. In fact, Burmese pythons may do better in 
 Florida than in their home ranges in Southeast Asia, where jackals, 
 monitor lizards, disease and parasites limit their numbers.&quot;By the time 
 they reach two years of age, not much can eat them in the Everglades,&quot;Hart states. She describes one python she captured that&quot;threw up four 
 feet of an alligator.&quot;Although biologists have recovered 10 alligators 
 in python stomachs, for the most part the constrictors prey on small 
 mammals and birds. 

 The new interlopersnorthern 
 and southern African pythons, reticulated pythons, boa constrictors and 
 four species of anacondashave&quot;ecological similarities,&quot;explains 
 Robert Reed, a USGS biologist and one of the authors of the report.&quot;They are large invasive predators that native birds and mammals arent 
 adapted to, and they are highly fecund, capable of producing up to 100 
 hatchlings in one nest.&quot;Theyre also big; some grow up to 20 feet and

 slithering invasion in the late 1990s. Snake numbers have risen 
 dramatically: in 2000 two Burmese pythons were captured in the 
 Everglades National Park; in 2008 the number captured hit 343. 
 Biologists believe that through this comprehensive restoration program 
 here in the Everglades, trying to restore a number of wading and 
 water-dependent birds, yet at the same time we have this big new 
 predator in our midst.&quot;Hallac and others do not want a repeat of what 
 happened on the American island of Guam. There the nonnative brown tree 
 snake invaded shortly after World War II and devastated native wildlife. 
 Since the snakes arrival, most likely as stowaways on cargo vessels, 
 Guam has lost 10 of its 12 native forest bird species, most of its bats 
 and about half of its lizards. 

 Given the number of 
 constrictors imported to the U.S. as pets (Reed pegs the figure at just 
 under one million) some species appear poised to take up permanent 
 residence. (Florida law stipulates jail terms up to one year for anyone 
 releasing a pet constrictor, which can grow from a 20- inch-long 
 juvenile to an eight-foot-long monster in a year.) Still, wildlife 
 biologists hope to keep the invasion contained. Although much of the 
 southern U.S. offers a hospitable climate, the availability of prey, 
 habitat and other factors will affect the snakes success. 

 Hart and others are working 
 with different traps, transmitters and&quot;Judas snakes&quot;radio-tagged 
 pythons that lead them to other snakesin an attempt to understand and 
 control the creatures. She laments the fact that Florida didnt take a 
 more aggressive stance against these snakes years ago, when the reptiles 
 were first sighted and might have been eradicated quickly. Says Hart:&quot;Weve gone beyond the point where theyre easily controllable.&quot;

 The Iguana Killers Club will be holding their first annual Iguana 
 Roundup Tournament on the day before Valentines Day, 2/13/10. Hopefully 
 this will become the annual signature event for the IKC. The IKC wants 
 to make this a yearly family fun event and hopes to attract hunters of 
 all ages and visitors from all over the country. The IKC is currently in 
 the process of applying to the TDC, Tourist Development Council for 
 $35,000 in funding for this great event. There will be a $13 
 registration fee per entrant, junior hunters will be free. There will be 
 no refunds once the hunt begins. The total amount of the money collected 
 will be donated to a local animal rescue league to help offset the high 
 costs of euthanasia at the shelter. 

 The IKC is 
 still working on the schedule of events which will include an iguana cook-off contest, Miss Teen Iguana 
 beauty pageant, Gun and Knife Show, iguana sighting bus tour, Guided 
 Iguana hunt with engagement, iguana skinning, deboning and cooking 
 demonstrations, deep fried iguana tastings, closing awards and 
 ceremonies with a spectacular fireworks display. Numerous hunting 
 equipment suppliers have already signed up to display and sell their 
 quality products at reduced prices to card carrying members of the IKC. 
 Dr. Ludwig Will Scrape will be on site to sign copies of his newly 
 published Road Kill cook book. 

 Any home owner 
 or renter that wants to have the IKC stop by and eradicate the evasive 
 iguanas from their property only needs to tie an inflated black balloon 
 to their mail box on the day of the event. The IKC rules of iguana 
 engagement, humane termination and carcass disposal will be strictly 
 enforced. 

 First place 
 prize will be based on the combined weight and the total number of 
 iguanas killed per hunter. The decision of the weigh master will be 
 final. As Valentines Day is not that far off, now would be a good time 
 to purchase an IKC-41MM high powered air rifle for that special someone

 [ No Name Electric ] Sloan, my friend, I had high 
 hopes for you here on the CT until I read your last post about No Name 
 Key. Now I think the only thing high are not my hopes but you. Are you 
 serious? Writing about what you heard from someone who heard something 
 from another? Getting &apos;answers&apos; from Mayor Murphy? Please! Your dates 
 are wrong and none of your facts are, well, factually correct. 

 Let&apos;s start with the numbers. So you say Mayor Murphy has 
 explained that power will cost $900,000. Sorry, wrong answer. The 
 current quoted cost is $690,000 and is dropping. Just to bring you up to 
 speed since you have been gone a bit, those that oppose power on NNK 
 broker in misinformation and lies. They also like to trump up the 
 numbers every chance possible, $1,000,000 being the often quoted figure 
 this last year. The Mayor&apos;s figure of $900k works nicely to continue the 
 deception and lies but the cost is under $700k and likely to go down.  

 Not that the cost matters, or should, to you or the 
 lawyer you interviewed. No Name has 43 homes. 30 of those homeowners 
 have agreed to pay the entire cost--all of it, my friend. We have not 
 asked or demanded that the County pay for this service. If the County 
 attacks us and tries to stop us from bringing something so unremarkable 
 as power to our homes then your lawyer friend and you might want to 
 worry. But first, if I were you, I&apos;d worry about the type of government 
 that would do what this one has done, dating back decades, to the 
 islands residents. 

 You say you don&apos;t like that some on No Name want power to 
 increase the value of their home. This morning I woke up in the United 
 States of America and in my America my fellow citizens thankfully have 
 the right to think and feel however they want. Sloan, are you writing 
 from Cuba? Sure, some want power to increase their home&apos;s value, so 
 what? Some want it for life safety reasons. Some (many, most even) for 
 environmental reasons. Some want it because they just want it and don&apos;t 
 want to be told that you can have it and they can&apos;t. Some want it for 
 all of these reasons. Sloan, why do you want and have commercial power, 
 air and such evil luxuries? 
 &apos;Not fair&apos; you 
 say? Why do you care? You don&apos;t live there? You likely have power and 
 much more at your crib. No Namers pay their taxes and have rights 
 exactly equal to yours. Would you like your rights violated? I think 
 not. It is far past time to treat every single person there equally and 
 fairly. Thankfully the law is on our side and this time these folks will 
 not stop, not rest, until the discrimination ends. Pass the bong back to 
 your friend, Mayor Murphy and her gang, before your next post or at the 
 very least get your facts right.

 [Conspiracy ] 
 Wow, over 1500 words, now that&apos;s a post! Please tell me that he paid for 
 that space and he knew both the Kennedy boys personally. This guy had so 
 much inside info I bet CIA, FBI and South State Mental Hospital will all be 
 looking for him. 
 [ From the Right ] 
 Have you every heard of the High Value Interrogation Group? No? Well, youre 
 not alone. HVIG was created by Attorney General Holder as one of his very 
 first actions as AG. The HVIG special task force was created on 1/22/09 by 
 Executive order 13491, signed by Mr. Obama. It was to bring together law 
 enforcement, the military, and the intelligence community to conduct the 
 interrogations on terror related matters in 
 a manner that will strengthen national security consistent with the rule of 
 law. When the Ft. Hood Muslim Fundamentalist Major was arrested, he was not 
 interrogated by HVIG. When the Christmas crotch bomber was arrested, he was 
 not interrogated HVIG. No one seems to know why. Its mind blowing, its 
 incredible, yet it figures. Mr. Obama and Holder consider these attacks by a 
 foreign enemy on Americans on American soil to be criminal acts, not acts of 
 war. Holder and his subordinates never even thought to activate HVIG. In 
 testimony yesterday it was revealed that they had not even considered the 
 issue of terrorist interrogations in America an option when the HVIG 
 guidelines were drawn. The crotch bomber was interrogated by the FBI for 
 only 30 hours, thats not a typo, only 30 hours, before they lawyered him 
 up. No other Federal intell agency had a crack at him. With class hubris, 
 the FBI said We got everything that we wanted. That, Deer Friends, is 
 utter absolute nonsense. Even in a simple homicide case, the suspect is 
 never fully drained of information. Remember in those 30 short hours they 
 had learned of the tie between the Crotch bomber and the Ft. Hood murders. 
 The failure not to use HVIG and to investigate the matter as a crime robbed 
 us of priceless info. It is sure to cost the lives of Americans. Holder 
 should be canned if not cained. Three years. 

 (Part II) We can only hope that Mr. Obamas all consuming ego will blind him 
 to the lessons of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey. We can only hope 
 that he will relentlessly pursue his dream of socializing our nation.. Our 
 national interests will best be served if Mr. Obama makes no changes in his 
 policies or his agenda. Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi will make an historic 
 contribution to the national weal if they stay their course. In just the 
 next few days, we will learn if Obama, Reid and Pelosi are true to their 
 claimed beliefs and principles. Or are they the nothing more than craven 
 apparatchik quislings. If they have honor and the courage of their claimed 
 convictions, they will not seek compromise or accommodation by 
 abandoning their beliefs for the sake of remaining in power. It is a 
 Hobsons choice of their own construct. To even appear to yield to the 
 Right will trigger a stampede of their base fleeing them. To continue on 
 their current path will simply stoke the wrath of most of the American 
 public. That wrath will make New Jersey, Virginia and Mass a mere preamble. If they fold, and just try to get along, it will be proof positive of 
 their lack of resolve and honor. These people do not have the hearts of 
 patriots, Ill bet they fold. When they do, the sound of the pounding feet 
 of their base fleeing them will be deafening. A Rachael&apos;s Rob Roy toast to 
 the next New Jersey, Virginia, and Mass.

 Mouthing] To the person or persons that keep telling lies on this

 [ Conspiracy ] It seems to me 
 that you readers or commentators out there just don&apos;t get it. If Reagan 
 was such a great President why would he pass such a bill? It seems that 
 President Obama is closing the deal for the New World Order (NWO) too. 
 The last true President of these United States was JFK. JFK made two 
 mistakes. 1. He really thought he was the true President. 2. He went 
 against the Military Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about. 
 Now look what happened to JFK for trying to go against the system. Not 
 only that, but due to his bravery, the media and others have influenced 
 the vast majority of Americans to hate JFK and his family. 

 An important fact that we don&apos;t tend to acknowledge is 
 that if Bobby were to have survived and become President, we would be in 
 a very different America today. The powers-that-be knew this and had him 
 wiped off the map because, like Vito Corleone said,&quot;It&apos;ll be bad for 
 business&quot;. 

 This has been planned by the NWO decades ago. They are 
 the ones who truly decide which candidate wins political office, not us. 
 Every President thus far has been and will continue to be a puppet for 
 the World Bank and the NWO. We do not elect the President. Corporate 
 America selects the President, and every other politician. Their main 
 goal is to disrupt our well being as citizens of this once great nation, 
 divide us by feeding us bogus political issues just to keep us busy. You 
 guys are falling right into their plan. 

 It&apos;s in your face plain as day and you continue to 
 dismiss the notion and continue to be in serious denial. I&apos;m addressing 
 all you Right Wingers and Left Wingers who continue the endless battle 
 of finger pointing and convenient blame. Their mission is to begin the 
 process by dividing the country, and you guys are voluntarily going 
 along helping them with their agenda. They cannot accomplish their 
 mission if we&apos;re united. I was disgusted with&quot;W&quot;and I&apos;m extremely 
 disappointed with Obama. I&apos;m still hoping that Obama is not a pawn of 
 the system, but I have doubts now. Many are being controlled to make an 
 issue if Pres. Obama is a citizen and focusing on him being black and 
 being Muslim, etc. Either you have no common sense or are not aware that 
 you are following the pattern of sheep. 

 When elected to any political office a thorough 
 background check should be done by the FBI or NSA. When I read all these 
 patriotic comments from them about how un-American the President is, and 
 how he forged his birth certificate and is really a Muslim threat to our 
 national security, what I&apos;m reading and understanding is that you&apos;re 
 saying that our national security is weak, unintelligent and are not 
 capable of doing their job and incompetent. The only reason why you 
 focus on him being black is because the media tells you to. He&apos;s just as 
 white. In fact he&apos;s more white than black because he was raised by his 
 white mother and grandmother, not by his African father. Hell, our fist 
 black President was Clinton because he was born and raised in the black 
 communities in Arkansas by his mom and Grandparents. The media couldn&apos;t 
 tell you to focus on that because it would be stupid, right?   

 The world is getting ready for something that we are not 
 being told about. The misinformation that we are being fed by the 
 NOW-controlled media is not telling us the true facts. I&apos;m able to 
 decipher some of it by reading in between the lines. How many of you out 
 there know about the bill passed by&quot;W&quot;that allows an international 
 military force including Chinese troops, to occupy, maintain order, 
 and execute disobedient citizens in the United States in the event of 
 Martial Law.&quot;W&quot;singed it, but I don&apos;t see Obama taking removing it 
 either. Its similar to the way the Patriot Act was shoved down our 
 throats and we just swallowed it like good little sheep. The reason why 
 you aren&apos;t aware of this is because the controlled media wants to keep 
 you busy with non-sensible issues, but the information is out there and 
 you can find it if you look for it on conspiracy sites. The only 
 explanation as to why our government would make this decision on 
 international troops being here, is because they know that American 
 soldiers will not shoot American civilians, but foreign troops who hate 
 Americans will, and gladly too. 

 Most of you don&apos;t have a clue about the damage caused to 
 our Constitutional rights and civil liberties. You just bought the story 
 with a very good sales pitch, and just threw your freedoms away. These 
 politicians have spent all of our money without any regard to our 
 economical status. They have lied to us, and continue to lie, continue 
 to make all the decisions and then enforce their decisions without any 
 protest from us. 

 Now we have to pay for their high spending. And what 
 do you do? You complain to the people who are in the same crapper as 
 you, as if they didn&apos;t know it or are in someway responsible. These 
 politicians live a life of luxury, and yet are the ones responsible for 
 the whole bad economy. In reality we are the ones at fault. 

 It&apos;s&quot;We the People of The United States&quot;. We are 
 supposed to tell our politicians what we want, and decide our laws and 
 spending capabilities--not them. They work for us, not the other way 
 around. Our tax money is being spent on so many things that we don&apos;t 
 even know about, mainly because it&apos;s their secret agenda. Why is our 
 Government spending tax dollars building Deep Underground Military Bases 
 (DUMB) and these so called FEMA Camps all around this nation that we 
 don&apos;t even know about. They&apos;re not offering this info to any of us. 
 They&apos;re getting ready for something big, and yet, we don&apos;t have a clue 
 what it is. They&apos;re going to wait until the last minute to inform us. 
 Israel has recently requested that all Israeli ambassadors return home. 
 Why? The medias not mentioning it. We should be asking. The last time a 
 country committed an act like this was right before WWII started. What&apos;s 
 important is how you need to point your finger at each other and prove 
 which side is the true American. 

 Let&apos;s suppose that some disaster occurs in the near 
 future and that is why they built the DUMBs. We&apos;re not going to be 
 allowed to occupy these facilities even though we paid for them. What 
 will we get? We will be left to deal with whatever situation arises on 
 our own. You&apos;ll continue to point the finger at each other, and the 
 truth is that both of you will be right for once because it will be no 
 one else&apos;s fault but our own. They&apos;ll be looking up at us from their 
 shelters laughing at us and joking about how gullible and stupid we are. 

 Major decisions need to be addressed by us now, before 
 it&apos;s to late and we can&apos;t turn back. If you Right and Left wingers have 
 a complaint about any situation that you disagree about, then form a 
 committee and voice your complaint. Voice that complaint through the 
 proper channels, and if they don&apos;t respond then have them replaced by 
 someone who will. The first step will be to prohibit any corporation to 
 lobby any politician or allow any politician to have any relationship or 
 ties with any corporation, or financial ties that will be a conflict of 
 interest being beneficial for that person holding office. The second 
 step will be the control of politicians salary. Third will be that all 
 decisions that affect us and our nation will have to be explained to us 
 and we will vote for the final decision. 

 I believe that if every community in this great nation 
 was to attempt something like these committees we would be on the road 
 to a good start. 
 [ Controversy 
 surrounds seagrass project ] On 95 acres of ocean floor near 
 the Seven Mile Bridge, a seagrass meadow damaged by boaters is Exhibit A 
 in an environmental group&apos;s controversial quest to start a new marine 
 mitigation fund for Florida. 

 Washington-based Ocean Foundation has applied to the U.S. Army Corps of 
 Engineers for permission to create the fund as a way for private 
 developers or public agencies to mitigate marine habitat destruction 
 that occurs as a result of coastal construction projects. An initial 
 report on the restoration work at Knights Key Bank -- the foundation&apos;s 
 pilot project funded with $45,000 in private donations -- shows some 
 success repairing the important marine habitat.

 [ Fair and Balanced ] I don&apos;t choose my friends by the level of 
 education they have. Being a good friend doesn&apos;t require a degree. But 
 I do expect that my doctors, lawyers, teachers, pilots, senators, and 
 Presidents of the United States have an education that has prepared them 
 for the tasks at hand. In other words, there are just some jobs that 
 require a higher degree of education ans training. It doesn&apos;t mean much 
 to me if my doctor is a guy that I would like to have a cup of coffee 
 with. It does matter that he knows what he&apos;s doing when he&apos;s working on 
 my heart. I also hope that the news reporters and commentators who we 
 listen to on TV and radio have the education that prepares them for the 
 tasks at hand. They have a huge responsibility to millions of people 
 who listen to them every day. They have the ability to shape minds, so 
 they better know what they&apos;re talking about.  

 In my opinion, the high school educations of Hannity, Beck and Limbaugh 
 have not prepared them to comment on the important political issues of 
 our times. Their comments are filled with emotion and ratings-boosting 
 tricks, but lack intellectual facts and preparation. They are clowns 
 who are smart at making money, being famous, and getting good ratings. They obviously were more concerned about making a lot of money fast than 
 by putting in the time and effort to earn a degree that would have 
 helped prepare them for their jobs (or maybe they just weren&apos;t smart 
 enough to cut it). I actually consider them dangerous to our country.  

 They take advantage of the people in our society who believe everything 
 they hear. Let&apos;s see, I&apos;ll stick to Rachel Maddow, Rhodes Scholar, 
 Doctorate Degree and as a bonus--nice! I, also, check in with Gretta 
 Van Susteren. Law Degree and nice. Anderson Cooper, a Yale graduate 
 with a degree in Political Science and International Relations, and, 
 again, nice.  

 Although nice doesn&apos;t come with a degree, I just prefer it over sarcasm 
 and a mean spirit. After listening to them, representing three major 
 cable news networks, I feel I have a fair and balanced assessment of 
 politics and current events from which to form my own opinions. My 
 opinions might be different than yours and my choices of news 
 commentators might be different than yours. I&apos;m just saying that it is 
 absolutely imperative in today&apos;s world to set your bar high and expect 
 the best from the people who feed you the news every day. There are 
 very qualified people and a bunch of self-serving creeps. You pick. 
 The 
 Mariel boatlift delivered over 125,000 Cubans 
 to southern Florida alone, plus the folks that have floated here since 
 then. Estimates of 12 to 20 million illegal aliens from Mexico are 
 poised to receive citizenship from the in house Democratic Immigration 
 Reform Bill. No doubt our government&apos;s estimate of how many folks from 
 Haiti that will actually get and stay here will be double or triple 
 that. 

 I continually hear about Cuba, Mexico and whatever other 
 country as someones motherland. Many times it seems to be from someone 
 who got a fast, free or illegal ride here. There&apos;s been many stories 
 over the years of people from Europe, the motherland to many, waiting 
 years to legally immigrate here. Jobs are scarce and entitlement 
 programs just keep on growing.

 [ Natural Born ] In a Seattle, Washington college 
 classroom, they were discussing the qualifications to be President of 
 the United States. It was pretty simple; the candidate must be a natural 
 born citizen of at least 35 years of age.
 
However, one girl in the class immediately started in on how unfair was 
 the requirement to be a natural born citizen. In short, her opinion was 
 that this requirement prevented many capable individuals from becoming 
 president. The class was taking it in and letting her rant, but 
 everyone&apos;s jaw hit the floor when she wrapped up her argument by 
 stating,  &quot;What makes a natural 
 born citizen any more qualified to lead this country than one born by 
 C-section?&quot; 
  
These are our future leaders. I think our asses are in deep trouble. 
 
The global warming advocates have a great strategy: no matter

 who were right. 
 Ms Putney was the Habitat

 Big Pine. Heck Big Pine is losing its sewer infrastructure because of 
 that Habitat Plan. If you were left out of the county&apos;s wastewater 
 master plan you can thank Ms Putney for that too. Look at those records, 
 see for yourself who took part in that plan deciding who got what. 

 And now the not really endangered Key Deer will be going

 the help of Ms Putney and her Key Deer Protection Alliance. No wonder

 What&apos;s with the people who dump trash items instead of calling for a

 [ Free No Name From Discrimination ] If Mayor Murphy 
 and Commissioner Wigington have their way the County and its citizens 
 will once again be bamboozled into thinking that one law or another 
 keeps No Name from having power. Before they do more damage it is time 
 for the BOCC to stop the madness and discrimination and assault of the 
 majority on that little island. What we know is that if the BOCC, or if 
 needed the courts, don&apos;t put an end to this then Ms. Putney will 
 continue to lie and mislead anyone she can find. Tough words? Yep, you 
 bet. But consider this. In a memo to the Board of County Commissioner&apos;s 
 dated January 20th, Ms. Putney attaches a July 11, 2002 Summary Judgment 
 that she suggests ended a 2001 lawsuit over power on No Name. 

 That lawsuit sought to have the County pay to bring the homes there power or compensate them for the lack of power. 
 As of today, the island&apos;s nearly 75% majority wants power and we have 
 agreed to pay the power company for that service.

 a highway clogged with exhaust-spewing traffic. It&apos;s so much better

 [ God Guns ] Secret Jesus Bible Codes on U.S. Military Weapons. 
 Army officials said Tuesday they will investigate whether a Michigan 
 defense contractor violated federal procurement rules by stamping 
 references to Bible verses on combat rifle sights used by American 
 forces to kill enemy fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

 The Marine Corps, another major customer of the telescoping sights that 
 allow troops to pinpoint targets day or night, says service acquisition 
 officials plan to meet with the contractor, Trijicon of Wixom, Mich., to 
 discuss future purchases of the company&apos;s gear. 

 The references have stoked concerns by a watch dog group about whether 
 the inscriptions break a government rule that bars proselytizing by 
 American troops. But military officials said the citations don&apos;t violate 
 the ban and they won&apos;t stop using the tens of thousands of telescoping 
 sights that have already been bought. http://news.yahoo.com/video/us-15749625/17700769 
 This recession is nothing

 [ Buy American ] That was a good article about 
 comparing where brands are made and buying American. I love it and I 
 will start reading labels. All you people that own foreign cars and 
 trucks wake up. I could understand it in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s, but now our 
 cars have caught up and in some cases are better then theirs. Also in 
 case you didn&apos;t know, KIA is the abbreviation for Korean International 
 Auto. Next year India is exporting a cheap piece of crap over here to 
 lure money from you. I do not want to hear that foreign cars are made 
 here. That is BS, because if they are, then the majority of the money 
 goes back to Japan, or Korea or wherever. It is a vicious cycle; all of 
 you buying foreign cars are taking money and jobs from the USA. If we 
 all bought American products there wouldn&apos;t be foreign manufacturers 
 over here in the first place. 
 [Sloan] No 
 Name Electric.  Once upon a time, there was a wooden bridge from Big 
 Pine Key to No Name Key. Before that, No Name Key was basically 
 uninhabited by humans. Maybe one or two lived there, camping out, in a 
 lean-to or shed, or on a boat.

The wooden bridge was destroyed by a hurricane in 1949. 
 Boat became the only way to get out there.

During the Cuban Missile crisis, No Name Key was a staging 
 center for CIA ops. The far end, away from Big Pine Key, was a ferry 
 terminal.

In 1967, the new bridge was built over to No Name Key. 
 After that, a few homes were built. Completely off the grid. No public 
 utilities of any kind, as it is today. More homes were built later, also 
 off the grid. Anyone who built a home on No Name Key did it because the 
 land was cheaper and/or to live off the grid, in Nature.

I dont imagine I am all alone in in thinking these whiners 
 hope to increase the value of their homes and/or make them easier to 
 sell in this terrible economy, by getting No Name Key on the grid. To 
 that end, they have forted themselves up with lawyers to go after the 
 evil county government that, in conspiracy with other imagined and 
 unimagined con-artists, twisted their arms into buying homes on an 
 island off the grid.

Part of the whiners offensive legal offensive is a 1951 
 County Commission resolution - yes, not an ordinance but a 
 resolution - they found, saying Keys Energy Services can put electricity 
 anywhere in the Keys. In 1951, the CIA had not even set up shop out 
 there. Boat or helicopter, or maybe swimming, was the only way to get 
 there.

The lawyer I interviewed said he recently told County 
 Commissioner George Neugent that he didnt want to end up paying for No 
 Name Key homes going on the grid. Commissioner Neugent replied, the 
 lawyer said, thats one of the problems the Commission is dealing with: 
 Who is going to pay for it?

The County Commission needs to tell Florida Keys Aqueduct 
 Authority, Keys Energy Services, and No Name Key homeowners who want on 
 the grid, that the taxpayers of Monroe County are not going to pay for 
 it. Its going to be paid for by the homeowners who want it. Or it wont 
 happen. The County Commission wont levy or collect the taxes for it. 
 And its going to be paid by the homeowners in cash, up front, before 
 any dirt is dug or any cable run or pipes laid, to make sure the 
 homeowners dont later try to pull a fast one and later stick the County 
 and taxpayers with the cost.

What I read in the Citizen , which Mayor Murphy 
 confirmed on the phone, is that just to lay the electricity out to No 
 Name Key will cost $900,000 above ground, or $1,500,000 underground. 
 There are 43 homes out there, not all of which want on the grid. Say 30 
 homes, for calculation sake, want on the grid. Thats a minimum of 
 $30,000 cash, up front, each of those homes pays just to get 
 electricity. Add to that, up front, what each home has to pay for 
 aqueduct water. Homes that want neither cannot be charged. It all should 
 be borne by the homes that want on the grid.

This is not unfair. This is giving No Grid Key homeowners 
 what they wanted when they bought homes they knew were off the grid.

 [ From the 
 Right - On the Road ] Yesterday was truly a phenomenal day. My heart is nearly bursting with 
 love, pride and with relief. Two events shaped the day. First and 
 foremost, a visit with our middle aged kids and their kids. The 
 grandchildren are a young teen and a pre teen. The union of a 
 conservative son-in-law and a very liberal daughter has delivered us 
 incredible grandchildren. These kids are full of love, wit, 
 intelligence, curiosity, and self-respect. Kids like these are truly the 
 future of our civilization. 

 Then 
 of course there is the matter of Scott Brown, the new Senator from 
 Massachusetts. Much is being said of the campaigning skill of Mr. Brown, 
 a little man from Massachusetts with only the thinnest political resume. 
 After all is said and done, his candidacy defeated the entire phalanx of 
 nationwide Democrat power, wealth, publicity, and a biased media. He was 
 faced with a Democrat numerical superiority of about 5 to 1 in his 
 state, he was outspent. 

 The 
 President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, 
 a previous President, and everyone who is anyone in the Democrat panoply 
 of power came to his tiny state and campaigned against him.  The 
 Democrats lost. 

 Brown and you and I won. The people of our nation won. The vote for Mr. 
 Brown was an ear shattering roar of denunciation for the programs and 
 philosophies of Mr. Obama. The squeals of Democrats blaming Ms. Coakley 
 for the loss really should be a source of much shame for all Liberals. 
 The weight of the loss of this race sits directly on the shoulders of 
 Mr. Obama. Ms. Coakley has joined the Reverend Wright, Mr. Obamas 
 Grandmother, and many others who have been tossed under the bus to cover 
 for Mr. Obamas shortcomings. The day was very much like the first 
 spring sunrise after a demon winter. Please pass the tea, it is very 
 satisfying. 

 (Part II) Ive got to admit that its a difficult 
 exercise to prove that little brass penguins with little brass nads live 
 in both the Antarctic and the Arctic. But its under 
 investigation. Yes sir, I looked all over Tucson today for clues. Ill 
 check out Phoenix in a couple of days. My diligent inquiries have 
 uncovered a whole mass of phenomenal data that proves that when we do 
 find the little brass buggers in both the Arctic and the Antarctic, 
 their little brass nads will have been frozen off. Most of them are 
 probably buried under the massive ice sheets that are growing in both 
 venues. How sad, yesterday a cute little brass penguin, today crushed 
 under billions of tons of ice, nothing more than fodder for a growing 
 Glacier. There is plenty of evidence that the Arctic Brass Penguin, and 
 the Arctic Fur Bearing Trout are rapidly becoming extinct due to Bovine 
 Caused Anthropological Global Ambience Transmutation. Fur bearing trout 
 have been spotted beaching themselves in the shallows created by so much 
 water being converted to ice. While looking for information I again ran 
 a web inquiry on the search term: Greenland ice sheet growing, then I 
 again ran the term: Antarctic ice sheet growing. By golly, there is 
 just all sorts of info that the ice is growing at both ends of our 
 little planet. You really should look for yourself so that you can know 
 more about it. The text and tone of a poster on this subject yesterday 
 sure proves the wisdom of T he 
 trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant, but that 
 they know so much that isn&apos;t so. Thank you Mr. Reagan.

 Methinks we have it backwards . Sending food to 
 Haiti and giving contraceptives to the Key Deer. 
County Commission to address, once and for all, Electricity on No Name Key. 
 [ Key Deer and History ] The history of specific 
 entities has often been used in defense of goals sought by special 
 interest groups. &apos;If&apos; the original history of the key deer was that 
 pirates seeded them here for food, then part of their history must 
 include being hunted too. If not, it&apos;s not truly historic but a 
 manipulation of history. We love the little critters, but given our 
 property rights vs theirs we bought our house on another key miles 
 away from them. 

 The holy powers-to-be want non native plant species 
 removed because they&apos;re &apos;not native&apos;. In the name of consistency 
 couldn&apos;t someone make the argument that Key deer aren&apos;t native and 
 they should be removed too? (Im just asking, not implying that at 
 all, so chill the attacks.) 

 Where else would there be a big deal about deer? At 
 Seneca Army Depot in NY state. It contains the world&apos;s largest herd 
 of white, whitetail deer. Their history of being saved might be of 
 interest. Their management is controlled by the army. There was and 
 may still be a heated controversy about who would take over control 
 from the army. I haven&apos;t followed it in many years.  
 Some of 
 the actions taken there, which turned the original endangered herd 
 into the worlds largest, may be helpful here. I do remember hunting 
 was used to thin the herd, not birth control. Then again, upper NY 
 State isn&apos;t nearly as progressive as the Keys (ha ha). Their 
 solution to animal over population is to pay for the right to kill, 
 eat and mount them on the wall. Problem solved and the government 
 gets cash in their pocket. Thats way too radical for here, right? Video 
 [ Frozen 
 fish ] I live on Cudjoe Bay, and for the last 4 days have seen 
 frozen fish on the shore. Parrotfish, dinner plate size black 
 Angelfish, small yellowtail and snook and man of war. I went 
 kayaking and saw a huge amount of dead fish on the bottom. Does this 
 effect the crabs and lobster the same way? Florida halts catching of certain saltwater fish 
 because of cold snap - South Florida Sun-Sentinel.com 
 [ Sour Grapes ] Someone disagreed with the 
 editorials of Steve Estes in the News-Barometer and said to 
 boycott the paper. What drivel. 

 If I boycotted all the media I didnt agree with I 
 wouldnt have anything to read or watch. Freedom of the press 
 doesnt mean only one view.

 The doctrinaire guy&quot;from the right&quot; contradicted 
 himself. He stated that Islam demands the extermination of 
 all other faiths, which is true, yet he advocates we convert them to 
 democracy by rebuilding their hoods. The point he misses, based on 
 his own arguments, is that Muslims will bite the hand that feeds 
 them regardless of what we do or don&apos;t do for them until we convert 
 or are destroyed. 
 

If Sloan wonders why people think that he is a lunatic, 
 perhaps it is because he writes about his dreams and literally

 &quot;The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in

 them over and over&quot;. ~Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Propagandist

 Dear 
 Pat Robertson ,
I know that you know that all press is good press, so I appreciate 
 the shout-out. And you make God look like a big mean bully who kicks 
 people when they are down, so Im all over that action. But when you 
 say that Haiti has made a pact with me, it is totally humiliating. I 
 may be evil incarnate, but Im no welcher. The way you put it, 
 making a deal with me leaves folks desperate and impoverished. Sure, 
 in the afterlife, but when I strike bargains with people, they first 
 get something here on earth glamour, beauty, talent, wealth, fame, 
 glory, a golden fiddle. Those Haitians have nothing, and I mean 
 nothing. And that was before the earthquake. Havent you seen 
 Crossroads or Damn Yankees? 

 If I had a 
 thing going with Haiti, thered be lots of banks, skyscrapers, SUVs, 
 exclusive night clubs, Botox that kind of thing. An 80 percent 
 poverty rate is so not my style. Nothing against it, Im just saying 
 thats not how I roll. Youre doing great work, Pat, and I dont 
 want to clip your wings, but come on, youre making me look bad. And 
 not the good kind of bad. Keep blaming God. Thats working, but 
 leave me out of it or we may need to renegotiate your own contract. ~Satan 
 [Key Deer Protection Alliance ] The Key Deer 
 did not get downgraded to threatened in 2002 as the USFWS wanted 
 because someone would hear of no such thing and&quot; she &quot;caused enough local political ruckus to stop it. A fter 
 all, how could that someone point to and use the Key Deer to 
 further her own personal agenda if Bambi wasnt actually endangered? 
 Just look at all the local Comp Plan policies and local crap that 
 same someone was able to put in place all in the name of the not 
 really endangered Key Deer. 

   

 Now due to the overabundance 
 of Key Deer, the No Name Key herd of not-really endangered Key 
 Deer will go on birth control, and yes, at a cost of 1/4 million 
 bucks. 

   

 So please remember to thank 
 your local Key Deer Protection Alliance as you open your wallets 
 again. Without her hard work we wouldn&apos;t have the HCP or 
 Incidental Take Permits and we didn&apos;t really want those sewers did 
 we? 
 [ Full 
 Body Scanners ] Supposedly the private parts are blurred, which 
 would defeat the purpose if another panty bomber came along. Can it 
 see between the rolls of fat? I used to work around a 400 pounder 
 who hid his stash there, it would probably work for other contraband 
 as well. Al Qaida has supposedly developed suppository bombs. I&apos;m 
 not sure I&apos;d even want to survive that blast! 
 [ Sloan ] Have you ever considered Hollywood? (Ed: Hes been on the Today Show 3 times.) 
 
[ Haiti] I 
 suppose it makes sense to increase border security because of the 
 quake, but it doesn&apos;t look like they have much left that will float. 
 [ The Simple Approach ] If the computer isn&apos;t 
 working, check first to see if it&apos;s plugged in. The simple fix is 
 usually the best, and, no, that isn&apos;t always a bomb. But I do think 
 many times issues are over-complicated by committees in government,&quot;too many cooks&quot;and all that. 
 The 
 mouse was not invented by Microsoft. It 
 was invented by Douglas Engelbert in 1968 and first used by Xerox 
 and then   popularized as standard 
 equipment with the Apple Macintosh. 
 [ Haiti ] Wouldn&apos;t it be awful if we had another 
 200,000 Haitians come to Miami? How much would we have to increase 
 our law enforcement? Four fold? Why not leave them there to 
 rebuild instead of causing us more problems than we have already? I 
 don&apos;t want to move back to Minnesota to feel safe. I like it here. 
 
[ Redneck Engineering ] I love redneck jokes. Some of the 
 creative solutions are just plain genius! Others are mainly 
 impressive because the designer lived through it.

 [ What women say ] If you know what we think, 
 why say something stupid about it instead of saying, Yes honey.? 
 Life is good today. You must understand what she thinks or you would 
 not have commented about it. Kudos to you. If other&apos;s only 
 understood it! 
 I had a dream last night 
 that Bashinsky was back. It was a nightmare! 
 

[ One-Light Town ] Would someone please fix the timer at the 
 traffic light like it was before the holidays? 
 [ Full body scans ] Why don&apos;t they make a photo 
 of the scanning person thats posted so that the person going 
 through these scan cans see their private parts too? It will make 
 humiliation even. 
 

Bag Balm is a wonder healer. Many times 
 it works better for me than does Neosporin. It&apos;s also great for 
 chapped lips. Bag Balm is an old time farmer&apos;s remedy used to keep 
 the cows&apos; milking machinery in smooth operating order. They don&apos;t 
 like to be chapped, either! 
 There was a time when, if we had played our cards 
 right, we could have had Pat Robertson as our President. Maybe he will stage a comeback and run with Palin or Beck.

 Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals who were in the United States as of January 12, 2010. This 
 is a disaster of historic proportions and this designation will 
 allow eligible Haitian nationals in the United States to continue 
 living and working in our country for the next 18 months. 

 Providing 
 a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the 
 United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by 
 returning to Haiti is part of this Administration&apos;s continuing 
 efforts to support Haiti&apos;s recovery. 

 At this 
 moment of tragedy in Haiti it is tempting for people suffering in 
 the aftermath of the earthquake to seek refuge elsewhere. But 
 attempting to leave Haiti now will only bring more hardship to the 
 Haitian people and nation. The international community has rallied 
 to deliver relief to Haiti. Much has already arrived and much more 
 is on its way. The Haitians are resilient and determined and their 
 role in addressing this crisis in their homeland will be essential 
 to Haiti&apos;s future. 

 It is 
 important to note that TPS will apply only to those individuals who 
 were in the United States as of January 12, 2010. Those who attempt 
 to travel to the United States after January 12, 2010 will not be 
 eligible for TPS and will be repatriated. 

 The 
 Department of Homeland Security continues to extend sympathy to our 
 Haitian neighbors and support the worldwide relief effort underway 
 in every way we can. Four Coast Guard cutters have arrived in Haiti, 
 in addition to a variety of Coast Guard assets that were already in 
 the area to support military air traffic control, conduct damage 
 assessments and rescue people in need of assistance. The Federal 
 Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) continues to work closely with 
 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the 
 State Department - the lead U.S. federal agencies in the response - 
 while coordinating the deployment of state and local Urban Search 
 and Rescue Teams from across the country to Haiti and standing by to 
 provide food, water and other resources as requested. U.S. Customs 
 and Border Protection (CBP) has provided aircraft to support 
 response efforts.   
 [ Global 
 Warming ] Has anyone noticed that as soon as an intelligent, 
 truth-seeking individual happens to venture an opinion concerning 
 global warming which doesn&apos;t match those perpetrating this scam, 
 all of a sudden elites start calling names like moron, and with 
 their condescending royal attitude, begin to explain their 
 bold-faced lies to us as if we were children. Well, to the purveyor 
 of rubbish who yesterday referred to me as&quot;moron&quot;because I 
 disagreed with the panicked hype over their version of global 
 warming, I offer each of you intelligent readers of our Coconut 
 Telegraph the following absolute debunk, from the man who broke the 
 deal at Copenhagen, (begin at 0:24:30 to get right to the point, if 
 you wish) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zOXmJ4jd-8&amp;feature=channel 
 Get the 
 picture now? 
 There 
 is  no global cooling trend . For the time being, until 
 humanity brings its greenhouse gas emissions under control, we can 
 expect each decade to be warmer than the preceding one. Weather 
 fluctuations certainly exceed local temperature changes over the 
 past half century. But the perceptive person should be able to see 
 that climate is warming on decadal time scales.

 [ Sloan ] Thanks Dear Ed, for the warm welcome 
 back, but return to the fold? Surely you jest. The only fold Im 
 in you probably ought to be thanking your lucky stars you arent.
 
As for how I feel about being back on CT, I am not too sure I have a 
 handle on it yet. Maybe I should start a scrapbook of the poison 
 electronic darts I would be really disappointed not to start getting 
 from the state mental escapees. I would say state mental candidates, 
 but they already candidated.
 
The familiar web link off my teasers Dear Ed posts to CT takes you 
 adventuresome readers and just plain fools to the Todays FlaKey Drivel 
 file in the menu of goodmorningfloridakeys.com, which Dear Ed set up 
 for me back in the fall of 2007. For which I paid him in real money, 
 just as I pay him in real money to post and link the teasers 
 that get the state mental escapees so agitated or used to, anyway.
 
I know from conversations with Dear Ed that he hasnt got a whole 
 hell of a lot of sympathy for the whining about my drivels, when the 
 whiners are getting to whine for free and Im having to pay 
 real money to hear their whining. The real money helps Dear Ed cope 
 with the whining, he told me in one of our psychotherapy sessions at 
 his home in the pigmy deer woods somewhere I aint telling, because 
 Im positive he dont want none of the state mental escapees coming 
 around there.
 
I read From the Rights bawlings yesterday, and found this 
 particular sentence astoundingly stupid wrong for someone who writes 
 the Kings English as if he was trained by leftist Princeton 
 University literature professors:
 
 You must ignore the fact 
 that American military is now present in Muslim countries only at 
 the specific request of their governments. 
 
Pray tell, Sir Right, when do we get to see the engraved invitations 
 to invade from Saddam Hussein and whoever was the putative head 
 mullah of Afghanistan before America invaded those countries, which 
 had never once started a war with America my country right or wrong?

Central heating, Keys style . 
 [ From the Right ] You betcha, you can always recognize the odor of elitism. I suppose 
 that the reason that the elitist amongst us keep their nose in the air is 
 because even they find their own odor cloying. An example is 
 yesterdays sniff that Ms. Palin is simple and that simple folks 
 solution to problems is to bomb them into oblivion. Its crystal clear that 
 the poster considers him/herself cut from better cloth than Ms. Palin. In 
 that posters febrile mind, he/she is simply a better intellect than is Ms. 
 Palin. Lets review the record. Do you suppose that the elitist poster has 
 ever held public office, if so as a School Board Member, Mayor, or even as 
 Governor? Has the elitist poster ever managed a state budget of more than 
 $5.5 Billion dollars without imposing income or state sales taxes? That 
 state even sends money each year directly to each state citizen. Has the 
 elitist poster ever sanitized state government by rooting out and evicting 
 the corrupt politicos in his/her state, even those politicos who were of 
 his/her party? Has the elitist poster even been the CIC of an armed fighting 
 force? Has the elitist poster ever been the Chief law enforcement officer of 
 an entire state? Has the elitist poster even fought Big Oil to a standstill, 
 while winning every battle with big oil and wringing tons of dollars from 
 them? Those bucks are going right to her constituents. And she did all of 
 that and more, without dropping a single bomb. But wait, theres more! Did 
 candidate Obamas record even approach Ms. Palins amazing record of 
 accomplishments? No! How is it possible that the elitists think that the 
 problems solved by Ms. Palin were solved by a simple person? The elitist 
 snobs are not a real good fit on BPK and environs, maybe Key West, but here 
 we are simple folks who fix complex problems. The decision of who to support 
 in the 12 Presidential election cycle will be difficult. The wings are full 
 of a host of very competent and charismatic candidates dedicated to 
 sanitizing the complicated mess that Mr. Obama and his henchpersons, (hows 
 that for PC), the Democrats hath wrought. 

 (Part II) Garlands and a host of thank yous to the witty, sharp-eyed and 
 geographically informed poster who explained to us morons that Greenland and 
 Antarctica are land masses. How could we morons have missed that? Thank 
 you so much for rescuing us from abysmal ignorance. That revelation was so 
 amazing that I decided tolook it up (you know, trust but verify). I 
 checked my beloved old fart Radio Shack Trash 80 computer and looked up 
 Antarctic ice growing. Because of its blazing speed, it took only an hour 
 to reveal hit after hit which says that Antarctic ice is growing like crazy. 
 It just keeps getting thicker.  Hell&apos;s bells, there is even one school of 
 thought that the ice growth could actually lower sea levels. Imagine that! 
 Astounded, and even more curious, I checked Greenland ice sheet growing 
 Oops, there it is again, hit after hit that says the Greenland ice sheet is 
 growing like crazy.  Weve got to do something to stop this pesky global 
 warming before the freaking brass penguins freeze their little brass nads 
 off. Picture that, geesh!

 (Ed: Hes Baaaaaaaak! The Coconut Telegraph warmly welcomes Sloan 
 Bashinsky back. Its our good fortune that he had a dream last night 
 advising him to return to the fold. Sloans lead-in to his website will 
 appear just before From the Right guys posts. Whatever readers opinion of 
 Mr Bashinsky, no one ever has accused him of being boring; and thats what 
 its all about.) 

 [Sloan] I 
 lunched yesterday with a group of Key West men who break bread together on 
 Fridays. There are maybe two dozen men in this group, and typically a dozen 
 gather on any given Friday.
 
Three guests joined us yesterday, a lawyer and what I took to be his wife, 
 and another man, who, it turned out, is a good friend of Mangrove Mike, 
 about whom I wrote some yesterday. Mike is running for the county commission 
 seat now held by Mario DiGennaro. Also running is a former holder of that 
 seat, David Rice, about whom I cant think of anything good to say except he 
 isnt a county commissioner now.
 
When the man probably responsible for my being included in this gathering 
 introduced me to the three guests as our resident lunatic, I laughed, said 
 to the guests (and everyone else) something like, The reason a lot of 
 people view me as a lunatic is because the alternative, that Im not, is

 [ Deer 
 Hunt ] Why spend huge tax dollars on birth control for key deer? We 
 should have a limited quota archery hunt for them. Charge $50 for the tag 
 and the problem is solved. If you want 100 deer harvested issue a tag to 100 
 hunters. Lets them fill the tag. The $5,000 generated can pay for the cost 
 of administering the hunt. Data such a weight, age, condition and blood and 
 tissue samples can be collected from the dead deer. Everybody wins except 
 for the 100 deer that are killed. 
 Congratulations to Sandy Carter on beating the 
 Countys Code Enforcement for a third time. The County has been making her 
 pay taxes on her illegal downstairs enclosure since 1983 then they decided 
 she was a criminal for having it and sued her three times and lost for the 
 third time this week. 
 [ Movie 
 Review ] Psycho . Its been fifty years since serial killer 
 transvestite; Norman Bates killed Janet Leigh in the shower. It was the 
 first movie that used the word transvestite and the first time moviegoers 
 were allowed to see a toilet flush (it almost didnt happen, the censors 
 tried to make Hitchcock remove it). 

 To save money, Hitchcock filmed in black and white. He also 
 filmed in black and white because he thought the blood in the shower scene 
 would be too much for audiences back then. That blood, incidentally, was 
 Bosco Chocolate Syrup. 
 [ You betcha I like Sarah ] Yes her ideas are simple 
 and thats her problem. Politics and running a country isnt done with a 
 simple approach. That approach appeals to simple folks, but simple folks 
 solution to problems is to bomb them into oblivion. 
 

[ Full Body Scanners ] A congressman who got to see one of the scanners 
 was really surprised. He said their much bigger than people think. He said 
 the picture is really big, so big, in fact, that you can see every detail of 
 our private parts. Yes, every detail!

Because they are so detailed he suggests they be only used for those 
 passengers requiring secondary screening. 
 Even Condoleezza Rice said no one is addressing the cause of terrorism 
 against the US and that is the problem with these wars. I agree. We can 
 never beat any ideology with bombs we must find the cause and try to 
 alleviate it. 
 [ Commercializing 
 a Tragedy ] On the Brian Williams news show the other night he was 
 broadcasting from Haiti. As a cheap promo he had the Today shows cast of 
 characters come up, one by one, and say how terrible the quake was. It 
 looked like auditions for American Idol. If Americans can use any event to 
 make a buck we will. Williams even went so far as to say they were all part&quot;of our trip&quot;, as if it were a vacation. 
 [ Key 
 Deer ] In 2002, the USFWS initiated proceeding to have the Key Deer 
 status downgraded from endangered to threatened due to the 
 overabundance of Deer densities at their core range. There were too many 
 Deer (approx. 500 back then) and their habitat could not sustain populations 
 at this level without risk of disease, starvation, habitat destruction, 
 consequences on other species, etc. Downgrading would allow management of 
 the population, would allow for translocation to zoos, etc. 

   

 Its 2010, and its time that the 
 Key Deer stop being used for personal or political agendas by someone or anyone! 
 
(Ed: Would Brad Washa please give me an email at island@bigpinekey.com I lost your ad. Thank you.) 
 [ Interpol ] Glenn Beck and Newt Gingrich have been 
 spreading the rumor that Obama has let Interpol take over domestic policing 
 in the USA. The rights conspiracy to destroy Obama gets more and more crazy 
 every day. What Obama signed on Dec 17 was an order giving Interpol the same 
 immunities and privileges as other international organizations with 
 offices in the US. Another wacky blogger said this was further evidence that 
 Obama was the Antichrist and would use Interpol agents with known ties to 
 Muslim countries to crush political opponents. 

 Interpol has no authority to arrest anyone here. Reagan gave 
 other international organizations the same privileges in 1983, Obama has 
 added Interpol to the list. The privileges granted include exempting them 
 from certain taxes and fees and the Freedom of Information Act. 

 By 
 scaring us as they do, Gingrich and Beck will make Americans hesitant to 
 share information with the agency which has the master database of stolen 
 passports and serves as a clearing house for police agencies around the 
 world to share information. The only Interpol presence here is a small 
 office in New York.

 I 
 am sick and tired of the redneck jokes.  It is racist and targets men

 some people like to tear others down ] A new business recently moved 
 into the Winn-Dixie Plaza, they have resorted to gossip and spreading of 
 untruths to promote their business, when they should concentrate on customer 
 service and quality of work as they other established shops have been doing. 
 They are being mean-spirited and them spreading gossip will come back to 
 bite them. I hate it when a new kid on the block comes in a tries to bully 
 themselves in. It has been my experience that bullies never win, they just 
 piss people off. They should remember that minute of kindness brings a life 
 time of rewards. 
 [ Haiti ] 
 Both the Navy and Coast Guard are increasing their presence in the Florida 
 straits to make sure the Haiti situation does not result in mass migration 
 anywhere into the United States. Several big cutters have left California 
 will be in Florida waters in few days. 

 Message to Cubans and Haitians: Don&apos;t even think about it. We&apos;re increasing 
 our water resources just for those of you who think now would be a good 
 time. 
 [ No Name Electric ] 
 County Commissioners : I dont care if No Name

 county into another lawsuit trying to stop electricity. And we damn

[It&apos;s outrageous how many people believe if the polar ice melts the 
 sea levels will rise] You sir, are a moron. Perhaps you didn&apos;t understand 
 that. Let me explain it to you again. Antarctica is a landmass, it does not 
 float on the ocean. All ice leaving Antarctica contributes to the rise in 
 sea levels much as adding ice to an already filled glass of water. The same 
 goes for Greenland. Get the picture now? [ John

 Things women say. 
(1) Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right 
 and you need to shut up.
(2) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour.&quot;Five minutes&quot;is only five minutes if you have just been given five more 
 minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.
(3) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and 
 you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with&quot;nothing&quot;usually end 
 in&quot;fine&quot;.
(4) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission. Don&apos;t do it!
(5) A Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement 
 often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot 
 and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you 
 about nothing. (Refer back to #3 for the meaning of&quot;nothing&quot;.)
(6) That&apos;s Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can 
 make to a man.&quot;That&apos;s okay&quot;means she wants to think long and hard before 
 deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.
(7) Thanks: A woman is thanking you, do not question, or faint. Just say 
 you&apos;re welcome. (Additional clause - This is true, unless she says&quot;Thanks a 
 lot&quot;- that is pure sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. Do not say&quot;you&apos;re welcome&quot;that will bring on a&quot;whatever&quot;).
(8) Whatever: Is a woman&apos;s way of saying f you!
(9) Don&apos;t worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning 
 this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is 
 now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;For the woman&apos;s response refer to #3. 
 
 [ Deer Not 
 Endangered ] Let me get this straight. The very same people who have 
 spent millions of our tax dollars to save the Key Deer form certain 
 extinction now want $250,000 more of our tax dollars to inject them with a 
 birth control drug so that they cannot reproduce? Only on Big Pine! 



The early bird gets the worm , but the second mouse gets the cheese. 
 [ Loose lips 
 sink ships ] What scares me more than anything else is the American way 
 of thinking that everything has to be shared over CNN/FOX/Headline News, 
 whatever. Does anyone truly think that the enemy is not watching these same shows and knows exactly what is going on? Our security 
 plans are out there, being discussed over and over. Yes, maybe our 
 population could do with some training, but then there&apos;s the WWII thought: 
 Loose lips sink ships.  Maybe a little less talking would keep these 
 terrorist groups from knowing what we have--or don&apos;t have.  
 
 [ From the Right ] 
 The other day a poster who refused to do his own thinking saw fit to post 
 nattering ripped from an article written by a Conservative talk show host 
 named Jack Hunter. The core of the posting and Hunters article was the 
 bizarre claim that: 9/11 was caused primarily by Islamists seeking 
 retribution for constant U.S. intervention in their&quot;holy land&quot;. Something 
 Osama bin Laden made perfectly clear.  Hunter would have you believe 
 that 9/11 was our fault. The CT poster and Hunter are wrong, wicked wrong. 
 Terrorism may be righteous in bin Ladens mind, but do the Muslim Terrorists 
 have a valid beef against America?  No, hell no, no freaking way! Its mind 
 blowing that a Conservative can subscribe to such left wing pap. If we are 
 to agree or sympathize with this bilge weve got to ignore the fact that 
 Nations and people from every corner of the world have been the victims of 
 Fundamentalist Muslim terrorists. Next is the fact that the Brits and 
 America discovered and engineered the petro industry that provides most 
 Muslim nations with the wealth they now enjoy. America provides the largest 
 measure of national defense to most Muslim countries. America, the UN and 
 our allies rescued Kuwait. America, the UN, and our allies ousted a 
 genocidal dictator who had invaded his neighboring Muslim countries and 
 murdered many hundreds of thousands of his own Muslim citizens. America 
 replaced that dictator with a modern democratic government, the first and 
 only in the region. America provided about $10 millions of dollars in aid 
 and offered massive relief to Iran after its 2003 earth quake disaster. You 
 must ignore the fact that of the top 10 recipients of American aid, 5 are 
 Muslim countries. America rescued hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Bosnia 
 Herzegovina who were being murdered by Christians. You must ignore the fact 
 that America attempted to aid and succor hundreds of thousands of Sudanese 
 Muslims, but were repulsed by Muslim Fundamentalists (MF&apos;s). You must ignore 
 the fact that American military is now present in Muslim countries only at 
 the specific request of their governments. Additionally you must ignore the 
 history of terrorism during the 20 th Century. Modern day 
 terrorism became an end unto itself beginning in the 60s with certain 
 German terror groups and it then metastasized to the tactic of choice for 
 these MF&apos;s. You must forget the tragic inventory of Muslim Fundamentalist 
 terror murders throughout the world, the victims are from scores of nations, 
 of many races, and many religions. You must also ignore that the MF&apos;s brand 
 of terrorism is not driven by any sense of nationalism. Fundamentalist 
 terrorism has no homeland no&quot;holy ground.&quot;Its roots are their religion. 
 Their religion requires the killing of infidels. To them an infidel is 
 anyone who holds religious beliefs other than theirs. Their religion 
 requires them to kill all who deny their religious beliefs. Muslims 
 Fundamentalists (MF&apos;s) terrorize other Muslims. Delivering death to an 
 Infidel is a sacrament. To these MF&apos;s merely being a Jew or an American is 
 a capital crime.  They count Muslims, Hindus, Christians, etc. as their 
 mortal enemies. Their religion requires them to strive to impose Sharia law 
 on the entire world. If you choose to believe as Hunter and the Blame 
 America poster believes, you must believe that the USA was responsible for 
 Japans attack on Pearl Harbor. You must believe that Poland was 
 responsible for Hitlers drive for lebensraum and America for WW2..The 
 logic in this belief is the same logic that forgives a rapist because his 
 victim was attractive. You must believe that the Holocaust was the fault of 
 the Jews. Perhaps a discussion of Hunters and the Blame America first 
 posters wisdom on strategy and tactics will follow tomorrow. The truth is 
 that I agree with a couple of Hunters points. But there is no doubt that 
 Bin Laden and AQI are not victims, they are murderous aggressors. 

 (Part II) The 
 posting the other day that was plagiarized from an article by Jack Hunter, 
 Conservative talk show host, was filled to the brim with error and wrong 
 headedness. One erroneous claim by Hunter was that Canada is nearly 
 terrorism free because there are few Canadians in the front lines against 
 Terrorism. Not true! Canadian troops are shoulder to shoulder with American 
 troops in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The article (see below) chronicles 
 terrorist activity in Maple Leaf land. It is only one of many articles on 
 the topic. Canada has become a cash cow for terrorists and a staging area 
 for their ops. I must agree that Mr. Obama is largely following the strategy 
 in place when he took office. That is pretty much a good thing. His use of 
 drones and adding troops is commendable. But, but, he is flat wrong in 
 treating terrorist attacks on American soil as criminal acts. They are acts 
 of war. He is flat wrong on his fixation to close GITMO. He is flat wrong on 
 his fixation on trying KSM as a criminal in a civil court. KSM should face 
 military justice at GITMO. Mr. Obama rates a mediocre C grade for his 
 handling military side of the Global War on Terror. Its about time that Mr. 
 Obama finally resurrected the real name and ditched the PC crap of Global 
 Conflict. He is now calling a spade by its proper name; he started only 
 after the attacks at Ft. Hood and Detroit. I agree with Hunter that armed 
 conflict alone will not conquer Muslim Fundamentalist Terror. Hopefully 
 Mr. Obama, et al, are deeply engaged in economic and infrastructure building 
 in deprived Muslim venues. We must discover ways to win their respect. We 
 should be building and operating schools to compete with madrassas that now 
 preach Muslim violence. We must provide the people of Afghanistan, Yemen, 
 and The Sudan with safe neighborhoods so that they can experience democracy 
 and capitalism. We must plant the seeds of a capitalist economy. We must 
 continue to aggressively pursue AQI and any other terrorist entities. The 
 issue is like a three legged stool, the failure of the legs will plunge you 
 to the ground. The best outcome is to have the Muslims like and respect us. 
 Failing that their respect and their fear is second best. Failing that they 
 must fear us. If we fail all three we will most certainly continue to be in 
 the sights of Terrorists. As time goes by they will finally acquire WMD and 
 the means to deliver it to your doorstep. God help us. 

 (Part III) Im 
 amazed that a couple of posters would violently disagree with my critique of 
 the theory of Man Caused Global Warming (MCGW) by simply listing the 
 credentials and findings of the same MCGW researchers that are in support of 
 my argument. If youre at all interested, take the time to read the article 
 cited in all the postings and decide for yourself. I think that you will 
 agree that it is highly unlikely that MCGW is a fact. What I think, what you 
 think, means not a whit. Either it is or it isnt. Have you taken the time 
 to compare the RR bridge construction photos from 1900 to todays sea 
 levels, if not, you really should. By the way, thanks for the kind words, 
 but you can be sure that mentioning that you are a snowbird is guaranteed to 
 generate flack from some CT readers. I hope that the snowbird critics can at 
 least acknowledge that without the snowbirds, there would be no Robs, or 
 Boondocks, or Parrotdise in our hood. Thats about a hundred or so local 
 jobs. Some of the goofy drivers are a serious pain, but I sure would miss 
 Rachaels Rob Roys.

 Party has become. Unwilling to see this legislation for what it is - too 
 expensive, too restrictive of our freedoms, bad for our economy and 
 therefore bad for our country - supporters greedily rub their collective 
 hands in anticipation of&quot;free stuff&quot;to which the bill will entitle 
 them.   Most, not all, but most Democrats have become whiners, moochers and 
 jealous underachievers who look in the mirror and fail to see that the 
 fundamental problem in this country is staring back at them.   Historian 
 Alexander Tyler said,&quot;A democracy can only exist until the voters discover 
 that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury. From that 
 moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most 
 money from the public treasury.&quot;  Sadly, that moment has arrived . . . I was appreciating CNN&apos;s coverage of Haiti until the ignoramus announcer 
 said the US was to blame for the destruction for sending money all these 
 years that the corrupt government didn&apos;t use to help its people. If we 
 hadn&apos;t sent money, we&apos;d be to blame, too. If we sent the military to 
 change the corrupt government, oh boy, would we be to blame! Since we 
 can&apos;t fix everything for everybody we are always to blame. I&apos;m very 
 tired of that and have no use for those who look at the world that way.

 questions are just how much do humans have to do with it, and how 
 much are we actually able to do about it? One thing certain, the action not to take is give

 warming either exists, or it doesnt. The seas are rising because of it, 
 or they are not. I hope that you are aware that glaciers, like our 
 geography, and like our climate, have always been in a state of constant 
 change. We recently read of reports from the early 20th Century that 
 chronicled warm temps, melting ice and melting glaciers in and near the 
 arctic. A few years later, those same glaciers re-grew as conditions 
 changed. Then they melted. Then they grew. The site listed below 
 inventories the many glaciers that are now growing through out the 
 world. Ice fields in the Antarctic and Arctic are growing. Ice will 
 melt, then refreeze. It has been so for time immemorial. Contrary to 
 your posting, the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing. The ice 
 between Canada and southwestern Greenland has reached its highest level 
 in 15 years  It appears that you did not read the recent posting that chronicled the 
 work of UN scientists that now say that the fraction of man caused 
 carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has not changed in the last 150 years. 
 That discovery is a stake in the heart of the CO2 greenhouse theory. And 
 yes, I will unequivocally state that many scientists are entirely 
 dependent on the existence of global warming as a source of income from 
 the host of industry and government grants. As long as the man caused 
 global warming theory has true believers they will continue to reap the 
 rewards.  Savvy entrepreneurs continue to reap fabulous profits on the 
 hysteria. If you doubt that, I suggest you do your own research to prove 
 me wrong. Since he left office, Mr. Gores wealth has grown to over a 
 $100 million dollars in his Global Warming enterprises. Mr. Gore is not 
 unique. Were there no Global Warming hysteria, Mr. Gore would be just 
 another has been politico.   I 
 took a look at the link you posted-strange how there seems to be 
 absolutely no connection to any mainstream scientific organization or 
 agency. I googled a few of the names that came up on the site and 
 immediately found myself in the land of professional global-warming 
 deniers such as:    Dr. 
 Timothy Ball, ( Timothy Francis Ball is a Canadian environmental consultant and former professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg , where he specialized in the relation 
 of climate to human settlement. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Ball disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change . He heads the Natural Resources Stewardship Project and is on the 
 Scientific Advisory Board of Friends of Science , organizations that reject the likelihood 
 of human-caused global warming . [ 2 ] 
  Joseph 
 (Joe) D&apos;Aleo , is a retired meteorologist who is a well 
 known climate change skeptic .   And let&apos;s not forget former ARCHITECT Robert Felix, who I believe is running the nonsense website you 
 provided the link for. You have the disingenuous habit of providing&quot;facts&quot;that seem to support your assertion that global warming is 
 some sort of massive hoax, while completely ignoring the weight of 
 the body of scientific evidence because of it&apos;s inconvenient 
 truths. I asked you what the vast majority of the established 
 scientific community has had to say about this issue and you point 
 to the website of a dilletante. Your claim that researchers who are 
 global warming believers are all lying in an effort to save their 
 jobs is insulting to every legitimate scienctist on earth. You need 
 to take a close look in the mirror and question your own motives 
 before you take sides in such an important matter. Try being 
 objective-it leads to the truth. Vanquishing Victoria&apos;s poop problem Floatie works! Finally 
 found a cure for Hot Flashes President Barack Obama promised an 
 expansive U.S. effort to help Haiti survive its disaster, not just to save 
 lives now but also as part of a longer-term effort to help rebuild the 
 country. (How about rebuilding Louisiana which is in AMERICA) Why are 
 there always those who feel that they have to tear others down? I suppose 
 the simple answer is in Psychology 101. &quot;To insult others makes a person 
 with low self-esteem feel important&quot;. I guess that&apos;s why From The Right 
 always feels the need to call others names and insinuate that they are 
 stupid. He needs to feel important. When posters tear down snowbirds and 
 tourists, it makes them feel pretty important, also. How about the poster 
 yesterday who called Anderson Cooper a thug! Ha! Anderson Cooper? Wow, 
 that poster&apos;s self-esteem must really be in trouble! It&apos;s never okay to 
 call others names and insult people who are different or who have different 
 opinions. It just makes the name callers look bad. Sleep Talkin&apos; Man Mild-mannered English husband Adam lives quite 
 a colorful existence in his dreams. From The Right says: It appears that you did not read the 
 recent posting that chronicled the work of UN scientists that now say 
 that the fraction of man caused carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has not 
 changed in the last 150 years. 
 I could find only one author of this 
 study, and must have missed the UN connection. 

&quot;To assess whether the airborne fraction is indeed increasing, 
 Wolfgang Knorr of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of 
 Bristol reanalyzed available atmospheric carbon dioxide and emissions 
 data since 1850 and considers the uncertainties in the data.

In contradiction to some recent studies, he finds that the airborne 
 fraction of carbon dioxide has not increased either during the past 150 
 years or during the most recent five decades.&quot;

 

 Here&apos;s link to the whole article... http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091230184221.htm  It does not bolster your case and in fact exposes you as the partisan 
 hack that you are. I challenge you to provide the scientific 
 expalnation of what this study really means, instead of simply jumping 
 up and down while pointing to an attention-grabbing headline that, at 
 second glance, is not what it seems. Analysis always wins out in the 
 end. 

 I encourage readers to thoroughly 
 research this topic so that they understand what the real issues are. The deniers constantly throw up red herrings in an attempt to divert 
 attention while the environment crashes and burns around us.  Fixing 
 these problems requires time, money, and making hard choices; all 
 anathema to people like From The Right (Guess the apple didn&apos;t fall to far from the tree)   UK

 What a week for 
 some County Commissioners on the telegraph and in the Barometer! To recap: 

   

         Commissioner Kim Wiginginton hires consultant/lobbyist Dona Merritt to 
 attack 35 No Name Key homeowners. 

   

         Sewage Polluted Florida Waters lose out to the overpopulated, soon to be on 
 birth control, Key Deer. Leaving 5,000 Big Pine Key residents up shits 
 creek without a paddle (or sewers). 

   

         Commissioner Murphy tells Citizens-not-Serfs and 7,000 Keys Residents she 
 doesnt give a damn about their FEMA problems. 

   

 WOW! And you 
 elected these people! ONLY 
 COMMIES TELL BAD STORIES. Only Commie Liberals are so stupid to even think 
 bats could fly out of a human&apos;s mouth. Commie Dems like you Prez, VP and 
 half of Congress believe that bats fly out of human&apos;s mouths. Why are these 
 Liberal Commies so stupid? I ASK YOU!  GO SARAH! [Climate Change] Over the last few years I have read a number of 
 articles on this subject. I have even attempted to read some scientific 
 journals on this subject which to me is oftentimes gooblygook. Some 
 articles have advocated that climate change is manmade, some the 
 opposite, some claim there is no climate change. At this point I have no 
 idea which theory or hypothesis is correct. 
  But our omnipresent righty-tighty guy espouses one theory, cherry 
 picking facts that prove he&apos;s right. I find it very scary that a 
 self-admitted&quot;old fart&quot;is the one who knows the answer. Anyone looting or roaming the 
 streets carrying a machete in Haiti should be shot on sight! [ Tourist Dividend ] In order to get a tourist dividend, you have 
 to have a government that doesn&apos;t spend like drunken sailors. THAT is 
 the problem with most governments. They spend first, and decide where 
 to get the money (from the rich) later. 
  Put the SOB&apos;s on a REAL budget. Then we can get dividends. [ I 
 met Linda in 1973 ] Shut up, Sloan . A woman walks into the downtown welfare 
 office, trailed by 15 kids.
&apos;WOW,&apos; the social worker exclaims, &apos;are they all yours?&quot;
&apos; Yep, they are all mine,&apos; the flustered momma sighs, having heard that 
 question a thousand times before.
She says, &apos;Sit down Leroy.&apos; All the children rush to find seats. 
 Well,&apos; says the social worker, &apos;then you must be here to sign up. I&apos;ll 
 need all your children&apos;s names.&apos; 
 &apos;&apos;Well, to keep it simple, the boys are all named Leroy and the girls are 
 all named Leigh Roy.&quot; 
 In disbelief, the case worker says, &apos;Are you serious? They&apos;re ALL named 
 Leroy?&apos; 
 Their momma replied, &apos;Well, yes-it makes it easier. When it&apos;s time to get 
 them out of bed and ready for school, I yell, &apos;Leroy!&apos; An&apos; when it&apos;s time 
 for dinner, I just yell &apos;Leroy!&apos; An they all comes a runnin. An&apos; if I need 
 to stop the kid who&apos;s running into the street, I just yell Leroy&apos; and all of 
 them stop. It&apos;s the smartest idea I ever had, namin&apos; them all Leroy.&apos; 
 The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead 
 and says tentatively, &apos;But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not 
 the whole bunch?&apos; 
 Then I call them by their last names.&apos; 
 Why are 2 County Commissioners dragging the No Name Key electricity 
 issue back before the BOCC, when there is no legitimate reason for doing 
 so? 

   

 Why should you care? -Because Alicia Putney is trying to push the 
 County into a no-win lawsuit (WANTing the County to violate State Law) 
 and she wantS to use your tax dollars 
 to fight her personal battle ! 

   

 

   

 State Law takes precedent over Local : As both County Attorneys have stated multiple times publically and to 
 the BOCC the County has no legal standing to object or 
 interfere , and it has been made abundantly clear that State 
 Law takes Precedent and Controls , therefore there is No 
 legitimate reason that this issue be brought back up at the BOCC.  Ignoring the legal advice of the County attorney is not in the best 
 interest of the County or its citizens.  This Commission has been 
 urged not to place themselves in that personally liable position. 

   

 In 1969, the State of Florida authorized and made the provision for 
 electricity for all the citizens of Monroe County; which includes the 
 taxpaying citizens of No Name Key . Meaning that No Name Key has had the legal right to electricity 
 since 1969!  Ignorance of the law is no defense: Monroe County 
 did not have the legal authority to interfere and deny No Name Key 
 electricity back in the mid-90s; and they do not have the legal 
 authority to do so today. The No Name Key homeowners are not asking 
 for the County to pay for the electricity extension , nor are they 
 suing for these many years of damages. They are only asking the County 
 do to the right, and LEGAL, thing by respecting and upholding the State 
 Law by allowing them to go about their business without further 
 interference. 

 

 

 Ms. Putney 
 cannot sue the County for (the County) NOT Violating 
 State Law . Ms Putney herself, personally , may sue the NNKPOA homeowners if 
 she wants, but she will have to pay for that herself, and she will 
 lose . Should any lawsuit arise, Ms. Putney may hold up her 
 non-valid County Ordinance, the one she herself wrote in 2001; but the 
 NNKPOA homeowners will hold up State Law.    Courts will uphold 
 State Law and invalidate local ordinances in conflict with state 
 authority .  A ny Conflicting 
 County Comp Plan policies, LDRs and Ms Putney&apos;s 2001 County-CBRS-Overlay 
 Ordinance were invalid , were revoked , by State Law: they were unenforceable and invalid on the day they were written . 

   

 Ms. Putney is 
 asking the County to hang their hats, and YOUR TAX DOLLARS , on 
 her invalid local County Ordinance . Ms Putney is asking this Commission to step on State Law for her! 

   

 Ms Putney does NOT 
 have to have electricity to her home, nor does she have to pay for it to 
 her neighbors. 

 But MONROE 
 COUNTY TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT SHOULDER THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR MS 
 PUTNEYS PERSONAL FIGHT! 

   

 OVER THE YEARS, Monroe County has wasted a lot of time and taxpayer 
 money ( both 
 at the BOCC level and in the courts ) 
 fighting against a basic service ( electricity) which has been legally allowed to No 
 Name Key since 1969 !   

   

 Now that the Controlling State Law specific to this issue , has been brought to 
 the attention of this current Commission , 
 now that County Attorneys have legally advised the County/Commissioners 
 to step away from this issue, will this Commission vote to thrust this County in yet another law suit , 
 thereby committing to spending/wasting more taxpayer money in a legal 
 battle to fight against State Law ; 
 all in an attempt to stop taxpaying citizens of this County from 
 receiving this most basic service (electricity) which the State of 
 Florida has made legal provisions for?   

   

 - Or, will THIS COMMISSION respect and uphold the Laws of the State of Florida ? SORRY ABOUT THAT, TRY THIS 
 ATTACH........WHO&apos;S GOING TO INSTALL THE CONDOMS ON THE KEY

 Star Mangled Banner Question:&quot;Why does God allow natural disasters, 
 i.e. earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis?&quot;

Answer: Why does God allow earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, 
 tsunamis, typhoons, cyclones, mudslides, and other natural disasters? 
 Tragedies such as the 2004 tsunami in Asia, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the 
 2008 cyclone in Myanmar, and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti cause many people 
 to question Gods goodness. It is distressing that natural disasters are 
 often termed acts of God while no credit is given to God for years, 
 decades, or even centuries of peaceful weather. God created the whole 
 universe and the laws of nature (Genesis 1:1). Most natural disasters are a 
 result of these laws at work. Hurricanes, typhoons, and tornados are the 
 results of divergent weather patterns colliding. Earthquakes are the result 
 of the earths plate structure shifting. A tsunami is caused by an 
 underwater earthquake.

The Bible proclaims that Jesus Christ holds all of nature together 
 (Colossians 1:16-17). Could God prevent natural disasters? Absolutely! Does 
 God sometimes influence the weather? Yes, as we see in Deuteronomy 11:17 and 
 James 5:17. Numbers 16:30-34 shows us that God sometimes causes natural 
 disasters as a judgment against sin. The book of Revelation describes many 
 events which could definitely be described as natural disasters (Revelation 
 chapters 6, 8, and 16). Is every natural disaster a punishment from God? 
 Absolutely not.

In much the same way that God allows evil people to commit evil acts, God 
 allows the earth to reflect the consequences sin has had on creation. Romans 
 8:19-21 tells us, The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of 
 God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by 
 its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that 
 the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought 
 into the glorious freedom of the children of God. The fall of humanity into 
 sin had effects on everything, including the world we inhabit. Everything in 
 creation is subject to frustration and decay. Sin is the ultimate cause 
 of natural disasters just as it is the cause of death, disease, and 
 suffering.

We can understand why natural disasters occur. What we do not understand is 
 why God allows them to occur. Why did God allow the tsunami to kill over 
 225,000 people in Asia? Why did God allow Hurricane Katrina to destroy the 
 homes of thousands of people? For one thing, such events shake our 
 confidence in this life and force us to think about eternity. Churches are 
 usually filled after disasters as people realize how tenuous their lives 
 really are and how life can be taken away in an instant. What we do know is 
 this: God is good! Many amazing miracles occurred during the course of 
 natural disasters that prevented even greater loss of life. Natural 
 disasters cause millions of people to reevaluate their priorities in life. 
 Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid is sent to help the people who are 
 suffering. Christian ministries have the opportunity to help, minister, 
 counsel, pray, and lead people to saving faith in Christ! God can, and does, 
 bring great good out of terrible tragedies (Romans 8:28). 
 
 Black Saturday: The Iguana Killers Club will be holding their 1 st annual 
 Iguana roundup tournament on the day before Valentines Day, 
 2/13/10. Hopefully this will become the annual signature event for 
 the IKC. The IKC wants to make this a yearly family fun event and 
 hopes to attract hunters of all ages and visitors from all over the 
 country. The IKC is currently in the process of applying to the TDC, 
 Tourist Development Council for $35,000.00 in funding for this great 
 event. There will be a $13.00 registration fee per entrant, junior 
 hunters will be free. There will be no refunds once the hunt begins. 
 The total amount of the money collected will be donated to a local 
 animal rescue league to help offset the high costs of euthanasia at 
 the shelter. The IKC is still working on the schedule of events 
 which will include an Iguana cook-off contest, Miss Teen Iguana beauty pageant, Gun and 
 Knife Show, Iguana sighting bus tour, Guided Iguana hunt with 
 engagement, Iguana skinning, deboning and cooking demonstrations, 
 deep fried Iguana tastings, closing awards and 
 ceremonies with a spectacular fireworks display. Numerous hunting 
 equipment suppliers have already signed up to display and sell their 
 quality products at reduced prices to card carrying members of the 
 IKC. Dr. Ludwig Will Scrape will be on site to sign copies of his 
 newly published road kill cook book. Any home owner or renter that 
 wants to have the IKC stop by and eradicate the evasive Iguanas from 
 their property only needs to tie an inflated black balloon to their 
 mail box on the day of the event. The IKC rules of Iguana 
 engagement, humane termination and carcass disposal will be strictly 
 enforced. The 1 st place prize will be based on the 
 combined weight and the total number of Iguanas killed per hunter. 
 The decision of the weigh master will be final. As Valentines Day 
 is not that far off, now would be a good time to purchase an 
 IKC-91MM high powered air rifle for that special someone in your 
 life. Check the Lunatics Anonymous web page for location, driving 
 directions and events schedule. You can also fill out your free life 
 time membership application on their web site. Mark this on your 
 schedule so that you dont miss this great family fun event. 
 (Yippee for us) Haitians in country illegally can stay Steve Estes hidden agenda:   What is the real agenda that Steve Estes of the News 
 Barometer is trying to shove down our throats now?? In his recent rant 
 about the state mandated sewer systems he appears to be creating an 
 issue between the USFWS and construction of the central sewers on Big 
 Pine and No Name that may not even exist. In fact, I would wager that 
 FWS will recognize the greater good that these sewers will provide to 
 our nearshore water quality and also wager that most if not all of the 
 central sewer system can be built and operated on scarified right of 
 ways along existing roads, never impacting any important habitats 
 whatsoever.   So what is Mr. Estes hidden agenda? Here is my 
 hypothesis: He is using this perceived controversy as another 
 underhanded scheme to prevent No Name Key from getting central sewers 
 and electricity. It is no secret that Mr. Estes is fast friends with a 
 particular No Name resident that doesn&apos;t want electricity or sewers. He 
 uses his tabloid as a weekly venue to spew misinformation, exaggerations 
 and untruths about this important issue to promote his anti-utility 
 agenda for this island.    I believe he is actually hoping to create or stimulate a 
 situation between FWS and sewer construction by implying that sewers 
 will cut through important endangered species habitats thereby creating 
 an issue with the HCP and mitigation issues. He feigns sympathy for the 
 potentially impacted people holding building permits but he is as 
 anti-development as they come. Don&apos;t let him fool you, his ultimate 
 goal is to push for onsight sewer systems vs central sewers. He 
 promotes them as a better alternative than central sewers, stating they 
 are cheaper and won&apos;t destroy habitat. Here are the facts: Onsight 
 systems don&apos;t meet 2010 water quality standards, they are expensive to 
 build and operate and they require electricity 24/7 to run their pumps. You also have to pay someone to monitor and maintain them. They are 
 nothing but glorified septic tanks. Trust me, you don&apos;t want the hassle 
 or cost of these onsight systems, ask anyone who has one now.    Steve thinks that if he can create a controversy with 
 building central sewers vs. onsight systems on Big Pine, then the same 
 would be true for No Name. Since he has devoted the past two years to 
 fighting utilities on No Name, this would prevent the 70% majority of 
 residents from getting the central sewers and electricity they have 
 requested. If you read his papers of late, he is so vehemently opposed 
 to No Name utilities that he is willing to fabricate and promote this 
 non-issue on Big Pine sewers just to further his ultimate agenda of 
 blocking No Name utilities.   So Steve, the residents of Big Pine and No Name are not 
 blinded by your smokescreen tactics. (Where were you when all the 
 utility poles were being replaced this summer, and trees were being 
 trimmed back and rabbit habitat encroached upon. Why didn&apos;t you ask FWS 
 if Keys Energy needed permission to replace their poles? ) No, you only 
 want to stir up comments and controversy from USFWS that are directly 
 related to your cause.     Residents of Big Pine and No Name know that central 
 sewers can be installed most effectively, economically and 
 environmentally-sensitively on scarified rights of ways. We see through 
 Mr Estes smokescreen of hidden agenda and we aren&apos;t going to pay higher 
 costs to help him promote his pet projects anymore! Say no to Steve 
 Estes and the News Barometers biased&quot;journalism&quot;. Boycott now.

 In the 1970&apos;s climate experts using hard science, scientific 
 research&amp;an untold number of colorful charts&amp;graphs 
 predicted &apos;A New Ice Age&apos;! Some years back climate experts using 
 hard science, scientific research&amp;an untold number of colorful 
 charts&amp;graphs predicted &apos;Global Warming&apos;. Now, climate experts 
 using hard science, scientific research&amp;an untold number of 
 colorful charts&amp;graphs claim &apos;Global Warming&apos; is causing 
 &apos;Climate Change&apos;. They&apos;ve done their very best to cover their 
 butts on all sides, no matter what future weather patterns will 
 be.   Through out each &apos;climate prediction&apos;, the &apos;climate experts&apos; 
 have continually claimed they were beyond being questioned. They 
 stood by the evidence of hard facts, undeniable proof&amp;irrefutable scientific research data backed by endless numbers 
 of colorful graphs&amp;charts. They always claimed all those facts 
 don&apos;t lie! They never seem to make that same claim about 
 themselves! They continually use apocalyptic disaster fear 
 tactics to defend each failed predictions.    As a non-expert, my opinion of the climate expert&apos;s 
 credibility, lack of willingness to openly debate&amp;their 
 previous failures is very telling. They don&apos;t have any idea what 
 the hell is going on! More than enough reason to halt any amount 
 of taxpayer money to their cause.   One person has been out front of each different climate 
 diagnosis&amp;solutions; For The &apos;New Ice Age&apos;, spread soot all 
 over the Arctic ice cap to heat it up&amp;melt the ice! For 
 &apos;Global Warming&apos;; &apos;shoot soot up into the atmosphere&apos; to reflect 
 sunlight&amp;cool temperatures! I frankly don&apos;t care what his 
 solution for &apos;Climate Change&apos; is, but no doubt soot is heavly 
 involved somehow! I believe the EPA labeled soot as a dangerous 
 pollutant to people, animals the air&amp;water.   What would millions of pounds of soot intentionally dumped in 
 the air, oceans&amp;peoples lungs do besides give us beautiful 
 sunsets? KILL US! That man is John Holdren, America&apos;s Science 
 Czar appointed by president Obama. Seems a strange choice for a 
 president so hell bent on &apos;cleaning up&apos; the world, don&apos;t you 
 think? Especially when Obama is ready to over burden&amp;over tax 
 manufacturing, businesses&amp;all American taxpayers to Save the 
 world from pollution! BULLSH*T! Maybe it makes sense to you?   I believe the flip flopping, all knowing Science Czar HAS given 
 MUCH thought to what injecting millions of tons of soot at one 
 time would do to the air, oceans, water supplies&amp;especially 
 all those pesky people. That would fit right into his theories 
 about &apos;population control&apos;&amp;management. If you&apos;re into 
 stimulating reading about population control&amp;unique theories, 
 America&apos;s Science Czar offers a lot.   These climate experts want to transfer our wealth to 3rd world 
 countries as pay back for our polluting past. They also want 
 their bank accounts filled, especially Mr. Al Gore&apos;s. Have you 
 gotten it yet? These are the people telling us, WE Are Stupid! 
 We need to wake up folks, Please do your own research before 
 it&apos;s TOO LATE.... FOR US! They don&apos;t give a sh*t about the 
 planet!   If you&apos;re really interested in conspiracy theories, check out 
 Andy Stern of the SEIU union. He&apos;s on numerous videos saying 
 it&apos;s time for&quot;the workers of the world to unite&quot;! If you 
 guessed &apos;unite&apos; means unionize, I think you&apos;re right. Makes the&quot;idiotic theory&quot;of transferring America&apos;s wealth to poor 
 nations, not so idiotic. Video

 Sixty Billion dollars: That is 
 the amount of tax dollars that union members and government 
 workers will NOT pay for Obamacare, but you will. You will pay 
 your share plus their share! Sixty Billion dollars: That is only 
 a part of the amount of new tax dollars that the rest of us WILL 
 pay so that union members and government workers can get a free 
 ride on the new taxes. It is for dead certain that we will pay 
 these brand new taxes just to fund Obamacare. Interesting huh? 
 Think about this: Only the government has been hiring huge 
 numbers of workers. Private sector unemployment is well above 
 10% and growing. Government workers generally get higher pay and 
 much higher benefits than do private sector workers.   Its 
 nearly impossible to get fired from government jobs, but private 
 sector layoffs due to the boggling amount of Democrat government 
 spending are common. While you and the rest of our economy are 
 pinching every penny; the Democrat government gives raises and 
 continues to grow. You are paying their ride while they pick 
 your pocket. I hope you understand this latest Obama and 
 Democrat atrocity is a massive government program that is not 
 needed. It is a program that is not wanted by most Americans 
 (only 36% approve). It is a program that will decrease the 
 quality and availability of medical care. It is a program that 
 will harm our seniors. It is a program that will probably 
 bankrupt our nation. This Cerberus of a program will nationalize 
 1/6 th of the American economy. Mr. Obama and his 
 minions know all of this, yet they proceed. They hold you and 
 your wishes in deep disdain. This newest Sixty Billion dollar 
 sop to the unions is a rip off of every American taxpayer who is 
 not a government employee or a union member. It is chafing 
 beyond description. It is wrong, it is just freaking wrong! 

 

 
 A couple of years 
 ago America went on a hate Bush binge. We became 
 drunk on the gallons of potent Love Potion number 
 09 and Any Body but Bush cocktails served up by 
 tawdry Progressive propagandists. We became enamored 
 of, and then blurry eyed intoxicated with the allure 
 of a pretty face and a smooth delivery. We knew 
 little of the history of the object of our lust, 
 what little we knew, we ignored because we were 
 truly smitten. After all, it would just be so yesterday to be judgmental! In November of 2008 
 the courtship was consummated. On 1/21/09, America, 
 still intoxicated, loved Mr. Obama, well at least 
 65% of us did. Not only that, at that moment, 42% of 
 us told the world that they preferred to have a 
 Democrat Congress while only 36 % preferred a 
 Republican Congress. We were so stinking loaded we 
 even loved the hired bridesmaids. But then it only 
 took 6 months of a Democrat Congress coupling with a 
 Democrat President to squander that love. By then 
 that lead fell to a 40%-40% split, yep we were 
 sobering up or at least the 25 % who no longer loved 
 the charming O were. Now, another 6 months into the 
 union, the bloom has truly fled the rose. America 
 has awakened to find coyote ugly in the national bed 
 and were really worried about the chancroids in our 
 future. And the burning and itching has already 
 begun. Today the coyote ugly Obama is in double 
 digit negative approval rankings. Today, most of us 
 would prefer a Republican Congress over a Democrat 
 Congress. (45%/36%). Just a year ago Mr. Obama was 
 wildly popular; today his approval ranking has been 
 in negative double digits for months. Heres only a 
 few of the reasons why. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am6f5EdHUpU . 
 By the way, the other day there was a very 
 interesting posting that suggested that we Americans 
 are at fault in the terrorist attacks on us. The 
 posting seemed a reprise of Reverend Wrights 
 infamous The chickens have come home to roost 
 homily. No time or space to discuss that wildly out 
 of whack point of view today. Tomorrows another 
 day.

 The tragedy 
 in Haiti sure puts things in perspective, doesn&apos;t it? I was home 
 sick from work on Tuesday when I turned on the TV and saw the horrific 
 events that were taking place there. Suddenly, my case of the flu 
 seemed pretty insignificant compared to the pain and suffering that the 
 people in Haiti are enduring. My heart goes out to them. I will be 
 saying my prayers and sending my donation to the people in Haiti. 
 [ Key 
 Deer to go on birth-control ] The Final Refuge Comprehensive Plan has 
 been adopted, and Alicia Putney must be stomping around in her combat 
 boots having fits. In spite of Ms. Putney&apos;s (publically documented) 
 objections, USFWS has found that the Key Deer are overpopulated, have 
 exceeded the carrying capacity, are themselves destroying critical 
 habitat, are endangering plant species, and they are having impacts on 
 other wildlife species.  

 The USFWS has decided that, quote, &quot; Hunting is not an 
 option for the Key Deer &quot;, so the Deer will be placed on birth 
 control. 

 Lopez warned of this overpopulation and need for birth 
 control almost 10 years ago. Finally, Ms. Putney is being ignored, and 
 actual management of the herd will begin. No more will we hear&quot;the 
 young, old and weak will just have to starve to death, it&apos;s mother 
 natures way&quot;as I was told by the president of the Key Deer Protection 
 Alliance. 

 From the Final Adopted Refuge Comp Plan, I leave you with 
 the following quotes: 

 &quot; For most of the refuges 
 history, Key deer were at such low numbers that bolstering their numbers 
 and reducing roadkills to prevent possible extinction were the primary 
 goals; carrying capacity remained a secondary concern. Recently, the 
 focus has shifted to include concerns about overabundance on Big Pine, 
 No Name, and Big Munson&quot;. 

 &quot;A second 3-year project will be conducted to evaluate 
 the efficacy of using a wildlife immuno-contraceptive vaccine to manage 
 deer overabundance on No Name Key and selected areas of Big Pine Key, in 
 order to avoid catastrophic disease outbreaks and reduce excessive 
 herbivory on the native plant community, for a total project cost of 
 $250,000. 
 [ Tourist Dividend ] I have a suggestion that would make tourist 
 season less painful to us whose lively-hood does not depend on fleecing 
 tourists. (and believe it or not there are quite a few of us). Why don&apos;t 
 we do like Alaska did to big oil? We could give full time Monroe County 
 residents a dividend with the money coming from the TDC&apos;s coffer. They 
 don&apos;t need to spend money to advertise the Keys any more. People will 
 still flock down here in hoards without the least bit of advertisement. 
 Take that money and refund it to the people who&apos;s everyday lives are 
 impacted by those precious tourists. I might not bitch as much about 
 some idiot poking along 10 mph under the speed limit while I am trying 
 to get to work on time if I knew I was also going to profit by them 
 being here. Or better yet, take that money and pay for the sewer system 
 that the bureaucrats say we need so bad.

 [ Oligarchy ] 
 While the political commentators try to get everyone riled up about 
 Republicans and Democrats and Communists and Constitutional Rights, what 
 we have now in the United States is a country that is sliding into a 
 Third World Oligarchy. Let me explain because no one has ever told you 
 what oligarchy means. It means that a handful of connected people run 
 the country and make a fortune ripping off the powerless peasants who 
 barely survive on the product of their miserable manual labor (think 
 Central American banana republics). That&apos;s what the United States has 
 become at the hands of both Republicans and Democrats.
 
The Oligarchs who run the United States don&apos;t give a toss about the 
 second amendment that says you can own all the rifles and pistols you 
 want. If they want to crush you all they have to do is charge 30% 
 interest rates on your monthly credit card charges. They can wreck the 
 value of your home and leave you holding a worthless mortgage that will 
 cripple you economically for the rest of your life, while taking 
 everything of value and feeding it to the robbers with your permission. 
 If they send the price of a gallon of gas to four dollars you are left 
 on your knees weeping next to the 15 mile per gallon supersized truck 
 you can no longer afford, but that looked so cool on TV. They won&apos;t sell 
 you 40 mpg small cars because that will give you true independence.&quot;Small cars are unsafe&quot;the TV says and you believe them. Smart move!
 
The oligarchs don&apos;t want you to have job security. 22% unemployment is 
 perfect for that. And they sure as hell don&apos;t want you to have 
 affordable health care. Keep your guns, you&apos;re going to die of poverty, 
 stress and obesity. They feed you cheap tasty chemical foods that poison 
 you and render you unable to think, unable to run, unable to get up off 
 the couch. They pour useless TV junk down your throat, while you sit on 
 the couch and drink beer until you can&apos;t walk fifty feet without 
 gasping. But you got your guns by God! Even if you are so unfit you 
 can&apos;t bend down to pick up a shell casing without getting dizzy. And if 
 you can&apos;t afford to go to see a doctor- too bad. Universal Health Care 
 is a Communist plot according to the TV so it must be true. Never mind 
 that your grandma loves her Medicare and her Social Security.
 
You better believe there&apos;s a kindly God looking down on you, even though 
 there is absolutely no evidence that God exists. God knows the political 
 leaders of this country exist and they play you against each other. 
 Abortion! Marijuana! Gay Rights! Affirmative Action! Illegal Immigrants! 
 Guns! Whatever it takes to distract you from the daylight robbery being 
 carried out under your nose. 
 
I saw a Monarch Butterfly in my garden today. I have a Monarch 
 way-station that is listed on Monarch Watch. They are truly amazing that 
 they migrate, and need all the help they can get finding milkweed and habitat. I just saw a hummingbird buzz by! Life is good in the Florida 
 Keys! Monarch Watch : Monarch Waystation Program 
 [ From The Right is playing at semantics] &quot;A murder 
 does not a terrorist make.&quot;   What makes a terrorist? Pray tell. The 
 9/11 conspirators were certainly murderers, but with a political and 
 social agenda. In other words they felt justified in their actions 
 because in their eyes they held the moral high ground. Scott Roeder, 
 the vigilante who killed the abortionist, Dr. George Tiller (who, I 
 remind you, broke no law) is mounting a similar defense in his trial. Tell me again, what makes a terrorist?

 The smartest thing I have heard this guy say yet. Obama tells banks: `We want our money back&apos; (AP)

 [ Tips for Arguing ]
Quoting is the act of repeating erroneously the words of another.
A witty saying proves nothing. 
It is better to be quotable than to be honest.
As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison 
 involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one. 
 

[ 3 TVs dumped on Watson Blvd ] Some redneck down here obviously got a new flat screen TVs for 
 Christmas. Now NASCAR will look even better.  
 [ From the Center ] In the ongoing war of words over who&apos;s more 
 willing to fight the&quot;War on Terror,&quot;former Vice President Dick Cheney 
 says President Obama has made us less safe, while Obama says the 
 policies of Cheney made us less safe. Obama&apos;s right Cheney did make us 
 less safe. And Obama continues to make us less safe precisely because he 
 continues the policies of Bush/Cheney. Arguing between the two is like 
 debating whether it was mistress No. 4 or 40 that finally made Tiger 
 Woods less safe from his wife&apos;s lawyers. 

 But at least Woods, deep down, had to realize his 
 behavior might one day come back to haunt him. And now Woods is learning 
 the hard way about that nasty constant in human nature: retribution. 

 Cheney and Obama, on the other hand, have learned 
 nothing. Ignoring that 9/11 was caused primarily by Islamists seeking 
 retribution for constant U.S. intervention in their&quot;holy land&quot;. 
 Something Osama bin Laden made perfectly clear. Bush/Cheney launched a 
 pointless war in Iraq, giving al Qaida its best recruiting tool in its 
 history. In his tenure, Cheney did absolutely nothing to fight the 
 terrorist threat; his administration invested in it--heavily. 

 Obama&apos;s wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and 
 whichever country next strikes his fancy, is a jihadist&apos;s dream. A new 
 American president, who despite promising change seems hell-bent on 
 continuing with the same foreign policy as the last president. When 
 former CIA terror expert Michael Scheuer was asked on CNN&apos;s State of 
 the Union last week whether U.S. efforts had succeeded in 
 diminishing the terrorist threat, he said bluntly,&quot;I think it&apos;s 
 stronger than it was before 9/11, certainly because the support and 
 opposition across the Muslim world to American foreign policy is far 
 greater today than it was on 9/11.&quot; 

 This phenomenon of opposition to American foreign policy 
 translating into terrorist activity is so well-established that the CIA 
 created the term&quot;blowback&quot;to describe it. Cheney and Obama not only 
 refuse to address blowback, but instead squabble over who&apos;s more willing 
 to use torture or increase airport harassment, a conversation which does 
 nothing to address the root problem of why terrorists want to attack us 
 in the first place or why there are more terrorists now than before 
 9/11. 

 Could you imagine police detectives trying to stop a 
 serial killer while completely ignoring his motives? Or how about if 
 police simply dismissed the murderer as&quot;crazy,&quot;which is probably true, 
 as many so-called&quot;Islamofascists&quot;are certainly not of the same mind as 
 you or I. Yet in order to stop such a murderer, crazy or not, law 
 enforcement still tries to get inside his mind, paying particular 
 attention to certain patterns. Our leaders in Washington refuse to look 
 at motive or patterns when it comes to trying to prevent terrorism. 
 Instead, we are told terrorists simply&quot;hate our freedom,&quot;as Bush put 
 it. Obama might not employ the same language as Bush (something some 
 Republicans laughably find&quot;weak&quot;), but to date has still not offered a 
 more substantive explanation. 

 Canada is far more libertine culturally than the U.S., 
 and this is precisely the sort of freedom that supposedly gets the 
 Islamist&apos;s goat. Yet strangely enough, Canada does not find itself 
 constantly having to worry about Islamic terrorism because terrorists 
 don&apos;t find Canadians en masse on Islamic land. 

 It is past time to ask the big questions. How can 
 invading and occupying a nation stop an individual or a collection of 
 individuals from carrying out terrorist acts? How can invading and 
 occupying a nation, or a handful of nations, stop a terrorist network 
 that exists in over 80 countries? What could our presence in Iraq, 
 stepping up the war in Afghanistan, drone strikes in Pakistan, or a new 
 war in Yemen possibly have done to deter the so-called underwear bomber 
 on Christmas day? Would the Nigerian, would-be suicide bomber have been 
 radicalized, or would a terrorist network be as available to accommodate 
 and encourage his radicalization, if the U.S. did not have such a 
 massive presence in the Middle East? Do terrorists simply hate our 
 freedom or is there indeed a correlation between U.S. intervention and 
 terrorist recruitment and activity? Hell, let&apos;s get extreme: would 
 completely annihilating the Middle East through nuclear war finally 
 eliminate the terrorist threat; or create the greatest terrorist threat 
 in our history? Might such genocide make the Islamic world mad? 

 Trying to fight terrorism by opening up more battlefronts 
 is like trying to fight alcoholism by opening up more bars. It doesn&apos;t 
 make any sense. No doubt, the five-deferment, Vietnam-draft-dodging 
 Cheney still thinks his belligerent rhetoric makes him some sort of a 
 tough guy, but it doesn&apos;t. It makes him stupid. And sadly, and at the 
 expense of our safety, if the definition of stupid is doing the same 
 thing repeatedly and expecting different results, both Cheney and 
 Obama&apos;s foreign policies certainly fit that bill.

 [ IKC ] 
 If people would take a positive responsibility for their cats and stop 
 them from fornicating with all the other free roaming cats there would 
 be no need to send the kittens to happy kitty land. As a responsible pet 
 owner you would have to drive roundtrip to the animal shelter to have 
 your unexpected new arrivals euthanized and your vehicle would be 
 spewing poisonous carbons into the atmosphere which is deleting the 
 ozone and causing global warming. 

 Shooting the 
 invasive iguanas with BB guns is good practice for young men and women 
 to better prepare themselves for when they enter the military services 
 and are expected to shoot and kill other human beings for the sake of 
 your freedom. The Iguana Killers Club has a high code of ethics and no 
 member would ever intentional shoot someones unwanted, unexpected, 
 unloved, unplanned kittens. There is no delight in accidentally hitting 
 a Key deer or any other animal with a speeding vehicle. When it does 
 happen, I as president of the IKC would hope the person responsible 
 takes the carcass home for dinner rather than just paying the refuge 
 employees to throw it into the brush on the side of the road and 
 allowing the vultures the joy of having free lunch. As too the infamous 
 four that killed the alligator at the Blue Hole, they got what they 
 deserved. They were not members of the IKC and they killed the alligator 
 for the trill of the kill and not for edible meat or protecting the 
 natural habitat of the Keys and that is definitely wrong.

 then stick to them. 
 [ Poster

 word and left out too many colorful expletives from my KKK manual. I&apos;d 
 use a photo like this except with Obama&apos;s picture, not Bush&apos;s. I&apos;d 
 prefer the one with Bush in a noose, but I settled for this one. I never 
 heard any Democratic lawmakers outraged over either. So in the spirit of 
 equality it would have been totally acceptable to insert Obama&apos;s picture 
 in either. 

 We&apos;ve been getting labeled as racists by wing nuts since 
 day one for opposing the policies of that &apos;light colored Negro&apos; Barack 
 H. Obama. The wing nuts use racism as a crutch and an attack tool. 
 Remember the kid who yelled wolf one too many times? That will no doubt 
 be the downfall of the Democratic double standard and their

 Attacks ] The from the Right man yesterday tried to say that the 
 terrorist attacks I listed were simply bad boys doing bad things and 
 just your average criminals. Ive never heard a bank robber or even a 
 murderer yell&quot;Allah Akbar&quot;while doing the crimes and Ive never heard 
 of an average murderer leave a church to go kill Jews like a few of the 
 people I have listed. Im sorry, but just because you dont know the 
 difference between a terrorist leaving his Mosque and going out and 
 killing people and a drunk guy killing randomly, I cant help you. Using 
 your logic would mean that an Iraqi court would never find an Al Queda 
 terrorist guilty because they would just be guilty of your run of the 
 mill hate crime. If a man kills an American troop in Iraq I find it to 
 be a terrorist act. If a man kills for&quot;Allah&quot;in America I also find 
 that a terrorist act not a hate crime. Your logic often bounces around 
 to suit your beliefs and lacks consistency. There were indeed terrorist 
 acts done on American soil during Bushs term after 9/11. But then your 
 party wont even admit 9/11 happened on the Republicans watch, but it 
 damn sure did. In fact Republican hero Rudy Giuliani wont even admit it 
 happened on Bush term. Try a little honesty in your postings instead of

 about a week, but you can&apos;t go back as priests. What&apos;ll it be?&quot; 

 The first priest says,&quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to be an eagle, soaring above 
 the Rocky Mountains.&quot;&quot;So be it,&quot;says St. Peter, and off flies the 
 first priest. The second priest mulls this over for a moment and asks,&quot;Will any of this week count St. Peter?&quot;&quot;No I told you the computer&apos;s 
 down. There&apos;s no way we can keep track of what you are doing.&quot;&quot;In that 
 case,&quot;says the second priest,&quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to be a stud&quot;&quot;So be 
 it&quot;says St. Peter, and the second priest disappears. 

 A week goes by, the computer is fixed, and the Lord tells St. Peter to 
 recall the two priests.&quot;Will you have any trouble locating them? he 
 asks.&quot;The first one should be easy,&quot;says St. Peter,&quot;He&apos;s somewhere 
 over the Rockies, flying with the eagles. But the second one could prove 
 to be more difficult.&quot;&quot;Why?&quot;asks the Lord.&quot;He&apos;s on a snow tire, 
 somewhere in Nebraska. 
 I met Linda in 1973, as I 
 recall, shortly after I began practicing law and while I was going 
 through my first divorce. We met in a smoky, popular pub called The 
 Plaza. She was there with friends, they met there once a week as I 
 recall. She and I dated a while, even though she was gay. She didnt act 
 gay when we made love, but it was what she was drawn to and eventually 
 we stopped dating. As time passed, we would run into each other 
 unexpectedly. Last time I saw her, maybe in 2001, I asked if she had 
 been with a man since she was with me. No, she had not, she said.

 [ H igh 
 Tide Cycles ] Mayor Nugent&apos;s article was more 
 about high tide cycles than global warming causing seas to rise. This 
 week the sea levels are falling. Now is that because it&apos;s cold, or could 
 it be one of those pesky tide cycles? Oh look, I can see rocks that were 
 under water last week. The Earth must be melting! 
 [ A nnual 
 Mean Temperature ] If you take the high and low 
 temperature every day for a year and average them out, that is called 
 the annual mean temperature. If you look at the annual mean temperature 
 from year to year there is very little fluctuation. Which reminds me 
 that it sure was hot last summer, but nature always manages to even 
 things out. Damn Mom Nature anyway, it&apos;s so inconvenient, but the truth. 
 [ Run 
 for Office] Why would any intelligent, educated, good quality human 
 being want to run for office in this county? The crooks are voted in 
 while the good candidates are raked through the coals. Look how much 
 abuse John Dick and Steve Pribramsky have taken. You forgot to add 
 Mario DiGennaro, the Enforcer, to the list. He&apos;s been known to hold 
 people&apos;s feet to the fire if they campaign for someone who is not going 
 to support his agenda. Don&apos;t you remember how buddy-buddy Mario was with 
 Randy Acevedo?  
 [ From the 
 Right ] Man caused global warming either exists, or it doesnt. The 
 seas are rising because of it, or they are not. I hope that you are 
 aware that glaciers, like our geography, and like our climate, have 
 always been in a state of constant change. We recently read of reports 
 from the early 20th Century that chronicled warm temps, melting ice and 
 melting glaciers in and near the arctic. A few years later, those same 
 glaciers re-grew as conditions changed. Then they melted. Then they 
 grew. The site listed below inventories the many glaciers that are now 
 growing through out the world. Ice fields in the Antarctic and Arctic 
 are growing. Ice will melt, then refreeze. It has been so for time 
 immemorial. Contrary to your posting, the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing. The ice between Canada and southwestern Greenland has 
 reached its highest level in 15 years  It appears that you did not read the recent posting that chronicled the 
 work of UN scientists that now say that the fraction of man caused 
 carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has not changed in the last 150 years. 
 That discovery is a stake in the heart of the CO2 greenhouse theory. And 
 yes, I will unequivocally state that many scientists are entirely 
 dependent on the existence of global warming as a source of income from 
 the host of industry and government grants. As long as the man caused 
 global warming theory has true believers they will continue to reap the 
 rewards.  Savvy entrepreneurs continue to reap fabulous profits on the 
 hysteria. If you doubt that, I suggest you do your own research to prove 
 me wrong. Since he left office, Mr. Gores wealth has grown to over a 
 $100 million dollars in his Global Warming enterprises. Mr. Gore is not 
 unique. Were there no Global Warming hysteria, Mr. Gore would be just 
 another has been politico. 

 Were 
 it not for the horrific consequences of Cap and Trade, this whole 
 kerfuffle would just be an amusement. Cap and Trade legislation is next 
 on the Presidential menu. It seems that nearly every week we hear of 
 some new proof that our climate is cooling rather than warming. I wonder 
 why our local true believers are afraid to personally check out the 
 evidence that can be seen at the base of every Flagler Railroad bridge 
 in the Keys. When the existing freeboard on their pier collars is 
 compared to photos of the bridges while they were being built, they 
 dramatically show only the smallest, if any, rise in sea levels here 
 since the early 20th century. Can it be that they&apos;re afraid of the 
 truth? http://www.iceagenow.com/List_of_Expanding_Glaciers.htm .

(Part II) It is incredible to me that supporters of Mr. Obama can hold 
 their heads up. Again and again Mr. Obama has been proven to be a facile 
 liar. Every day sprouts a new set of lies. He is now a Chia head of 
 perfidy. How can you have pride in that? The only lies that I will 
 consider today are his lies wherein he promised: First Open and 
 transparent government. At least 8 times during the campaign he 
 clearly and specifically said that all negotiations on Obamacare would 
 be out in the open and would be broadcast on C-Span. C-Span recently 
 offered to accommodate the President, he refused. C-Span then demanded 
 that he honor his promises, again he refused. The ultra secret 
 negotiations are in progress, no Republican is permitted to even attend. 
 We are not even being told who is involved in the negotiations. If all 
 of this is honest and it is the best interest of America, why is Mr. 
 Obama ashamed of what is going on? Why is he adamant in keeping it 
 secret? The second set of lies is those wherein he said that Obamacare 
 would not cause any new taxes to the common man, and that if you like 
 your current health insurance, you can keep it. Today it was revealed 
 that working folks who have good health insurance through their employer 
 will be stuck with a brand new tax on their policies. It was revealed 
 that you will be hit with a new tax of 40% on the value of your policy. 
 Of course, that will make your policy too expensive, so you will either 
 dump your really good policy or pay an additional 40% for it. That damn 
 sure is a new tax, a new tax that will drive you out of your existing 
 policy. Further, it is now estimated that Obamacare cannot fail but to 
 cost $2 Trillion dollars. Major increases in every workers tax bill are 
 inevitable. But wait, theres more!!!!! What Ive just said will be 
 true if Obamascare becomes law. Every American, except Union Members 
 will be stuck with the tax! Thats right, as insane as it sounds; they 
 promise to exempt Union members from the tax. That is the exact back 
 room, secret deal that the struck with the Unions. Remember that fewer 
 than 40% of Americans now want socialized medicine. Remember too that 
 only about 9% of American workers in private employ are union members. 
 When government unionized workers are added to the mix, still only 13% 
 of Americans workers are unionized. Why does our President choose to 
 punish 87% of American workers for the benefit of 13% of government 
 workers? Ive got a damn good idea, but Ill save it for another day. 
 How can you Democrats continue to support this insanity?

[ Bogie Channel Yacht Club ] Here&apos;s the last remaining burgee from 
 the Club. The good old days and I&apos;ve still got the t-shirt too (its 
 pretty thin, though). 
 What a hateful comment submitted from someone directed to another 
 about driving a nice car, yet shopping at Salvation Army. Reading that 
 post, I think the writer has a woe-is-me complex and seems to 
 blame others for their problems. If you think its so bad after being 
 here for 30 years and its tanked so much--leave. This is the best 
 place I have ever been privileged to live. I also probably work harder 
 than I ever did in my life. 

 But on the flip side, I&apos;ve also never been anywhere else that has so 
 much opportunity available. People here are wonderful, I love my 
 neighbors, I love my community, I love the Keys. Make yourself useful 
 sometime and maybe volunteer for a cause bigger than yourself. 
 There&apos;s opportunity here for that as well. To the hater who posted I 
 hope you find peace in your life; you need it . You sound so unhappy. 
 What a sad waste of precious time in your life. 
 [ USFWL 
 or County kill Slash Pines on No Name Key] I know that USFWL and 
 the County hire people to remove exotic trees such as Austrian Pines 
 from conservation.  

 It has happened again. Someone who can&apos;t tell the 
 difference between pines has cut down about 25 mature Slash Pines on No 
 Name Key! Why keep talking about the deer habitat when it is the USFWL 
 and the County who is killing the habitat? Isn&apos;t it time the USFWL and 
 County put their money where their mouth is and stop killing native 
 trees? 
 [ Sick-o ] The poster who commented on yesterday&apos;s CT about Haiti 
 is a monster without a soul or heart. Evidently he thinks it&apos;s a good 
 thing that hundreds of thousands of innocent people have died and 
 millions more are starving.  The poster is a disgrace to the human 
 race. Did he post his vulgar comments because he was proud of them?  
 [ Disease 
 For Sale ] Suicide, homicide, domestic violence, grievous bodily 
 harm, vandalism, self abuse and unborn- child 
 abuse are all consequences of alcohol consumption. And yet, the disease 
 of alcohol is easily and roundly avoided by simply not consuming it. For 
 if alcohol is indeed a disease, no less the Devils deadly disease, even 
 though it be the only disease which is sold in bottles. Please let me 
 have a bottle of diseased Jack Daniels

Is advertised in newspapers, magazines, radios and television. 
 Budweiser the King of beers presents the disease of...

 by the will of man. Pour me a double shot of Crown Royal disease.

 Propels one&apos;s

 unknown disease of
 
Destroys family life and increases crime. Diseased wife shot and killed 
 her husband.
 
Dont blame me for any of this, blame it on my disease. Its the only 
 disease that you can buy in a bottle. 
 From The Right says  &quot;The 
 entire notion of man caused global warming is now under deep 
 suspicion. The settled science has been found to be product of 
 questionable methods, politics, fraudulent data, and even lost or 
 destroyed primary data. That data having gone missing when its validity 
 was challenged. Yet another scientist has proved that the fraction of 
 man caused c02 in our atmosphere has not changed appreciably in the last 
 150 years. There is strong and growing evidence that the computer 
 models that purport to chronicle and predict global warming are faulty.&quot; 

 Would you say that there is less or greater acceptance of 
 global warming claims by the scientific community today vs ten years 
 ago? How about among the general population? How do you explain away 
 the disappearance of the world&apos;s mountain glaciers; a phenomenon that 
 closely tracks the rapid rise of human-related CO2 emissions into the 
 atmosphere? So says the body of evidence produced by the scientific 
 community to date. There are and always will be agenda-driven 
 interlopers on both sides of the issue; fame and power are potent lures; 
 but it&apos;s up to us to see through the veil and choose wisely. What are 
 most of the people who study global warming for a living saying? And 
 please, don&apos;t tell me that they play scaremonger simply to keep their 
 jobs alive. Anyone intelligent enough to study this complex field is 
 certainly capable of remaining employed in it even if this particular 
 path is no longer pursued. 

 It matters not that you haven&apos;t yet been personally 
 affected. It&apos;s a simple matter of physics. If today&apos;s trend continues 
 and the world&apos;s mountain glaciers and a significant portion of the 
 Greenland Ice Sheet melts into the oceans, you&apos;ll be holding up those 
 photos from 1900 as the water rises to your underwear. Of course, we&apos;ll 
 all probably be dead by then so what does it matter, right?

 there butts off to build a life her, buy a home and keep it up, pay 
 taxes, send there kids to school and support those schools with time and

 [ Feeding 
 the deer] Since the County put five new signs starting at US1 and 
 pointing tourist along the way with even more signs to No Name Key, I 
 suspect the killing rate for the deer will drastically increase. I live 
 on the island and there are so many tourists who stop right in the 
 middle of the road, doors fly open, and adults and kids run out to feed 
 the deer. At night they also stop in the middle of road with beam 
 lights on, doors open feeding the deer in front of their headlights. How stupid can you get? Oncoming traffic can see anything but lights 
 shining in the eyes and I have almost killed a deer several times 
 recently because tourists do stupid things to get the deer to come out 
 into the road to eat. The County was suppose to limit vehicular traffic 
 in the deer habitat, but we need more signs pointing the way. More deer 
 are going to be killed. On second thought, maybe that is the County&apos;s 
 plan. When the deer herd reached 800, USFWL tried to take them off the 
 endangered list. Monroe County killed that idea real fast. So if the 
 County keeps killing the deer, the number will stay low enough to stay 
 on the endangered list forever and the County can keep taking land off 
 the tax roles so the rest of us suckers can pay the bill.

 [Compassion] Pat Robertson, the 
 evangelical Christian who once suggested God was punishing Americans 
 with Hurricane Katrina, says a&quot;pact to the devil&quot;brought on the 
 devastating earthquake in Haiti. 

 Officials fear more than 100,000 people have died as a 
 result of Tuesday&apos;s 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Robertson, the 
 host of the&quot;700 Club,&quot;blamed the tragedy on something that&quot;happened a 
 long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it.&quot; 

 The Haitians&quot;were under the heel of the French. You 
 know, Napoleon III and whatever,&quot;Robertson said on his broadcast 
 Wednesday.&quot;And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They 
 said, &apos;We will serve you if you will get us free from the French.&apos; True 
 story. And so, the devil said, &apos;OK, it&apos;s a deal.&apos;&quot;

Everybody&apos;s favorite drunken airline pilot . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzAXb7qCCAo [ Feeling 
 Lucky Button ] Google cofounder Sergey Brin told public radio&apos;s Marketplace that around one 
 percent of all Google searches go through the&quot;I&apos;m Feeling

 the top search result, Google doesn&apos;t get to show search ads 
 on one percent of all its searches. That costs the company 
 around $110 million in annual revenue, according to Rapt&apos;s

 [ From the Right ] 
 Yesterday a poster cited 4 examples of Muslims committing murder in the USA 
 between 9/11/01 and 1/21/09, the Bush years. That poster said that those 
 murders are proof that GWB did not keep us safe from terrorism on our soil 
 during his tenure. That poster let his angst blind him to the truth, 
 he failed to do sufficient research to discover that Muslims, like 
 Christians, like gang members, like every other sort of human being have 
 committed a lot of hate crime murders during those years. Hate in and of 
 itself is not an prerequisite of terrorism. A hate crime committed by a 
 Muslim is not necessarily an act of terrorism any more than a hate crime 
 murder with a Muslim victim committed by a Jew is. A murder does not a 
 terrorist make. The fact that there was no blood shed on American soil by 
 terrorists during the Bush years is well documented. All federal, state, and 
 local law enforcement agencies report that the murders that the peeved 
 poster crowed about had no connection nor any planning nor any involvement 
 by AQI or any other terrorist agency. The most recent terrorist murders on 
 the Obama watch have been fully documented to have a direct lineage to AQI.  Hopefully 
 someday the peeved poster will realize that denying the truth over and over 
 again, cannot change the truth. The truth is what it is and it often hurts. Sorry to cause that peeved Poster any pain------Nah, Im not sorry. By the 
 way, it was good to hear kind words concerning these posts. The CT would be 
 even more interesting and more fun if more folks would make just a little 
 effort and toss in their thoughts and opinions.. It would be a real eye 
 opener if all CT posters just took the time to fact check, but it would rob 
 me of a lot of ammo. You know, even the left wing posters could bring a lot 
 to the table if they would only try. Cmon in, the waters just fine.

 Wednesday 
 January 13, 2010 (Ed: We&apos;re late today, I 
 was daydreaming of warm Florida Keys. Sorry) There 
 once was The Bogie Chanel Yacht Club our motto was&quot;Unique is what we seek, Bizarre is what we are.&quot;Roy Boy 
 was the one who came up with the motto. It all started out real well as 
 just about everyone had a boat. The pride of the fleet was the Mistress belonging to J.W. All the other boats were smaller. All the 
 members were the enthusiastic partying kind. Officers were elected, the 
 Commodore was T.R. the Vice Commodore was E.D. A treasurer was elected 
 and everyone paid their dues. The treasurer was a Big Pine woman, the 
 spouse of an old time resident of Big Pine Key. She was well respected 
 and pretty. Everything was great. 
 We had a pig roast using a Cuban Coffin. Buzzy made the 
 moho marinade and all were welcome for a few bucks a plate. The 
 ready-to-roast pig we got from Rita at Island Jim&apos;s&apos; Chek Jon 
 prepared the watermelons spiked with vodka (One of the woman, not 
 knowing it was spiked, sliced it up and gave some to all the children). 
 It was a very successful event and the treasury grew. We had intentions 
 to do bigger and better things. 

 The trouble is that some people are not what they seem to 
 be. One day our pretty treasurer, Jackie, disappeared with the whole 
 treasury. She stole all the dues the members had paid and all the funds 
 the club earned by providing a good time for all. When I suggested that 
 she should be charged with theft, I was told that can&apos;t be done because 
 she is the spouse of one of the Bubbas. 

 The Bogie Channel Yacht Club never recovered from this 
 financial disaster, there were others that tried to keep it going, but 
 it finally sank. The thief knew us all and she never offered an apology 
 or excuse and I believe she is still an EMT in the Lower Keys. ~imrebaka@gmail.com To 
 the person whose black wallet I found in the shopping cart behind 
 the pawn shop at the Winn Dixie shopping center: I have been out of 
 town and just catching up on bigpinekey.com. It was my pleasure to 
 return your wallet. I realize the damage that could have been done with 
 all of that information. I could only hope that someone would do the 
 same for me.

 Feeding 
 Key deer makes them lose their natural fear of humans and become 
 easy targets for poachers  Give me a break. The poachers on Big Pine are only interested in iguanas. The deer are 
 easy targets because of fifty years of extreme measures to create an 
 unnatural situation where deer are encouraged to live in subdivisions. If we can build a $9 million underpass for deer to cross US1 without 
 getting hit, what is so unnatural about giving our unlikely neighbors a 
 handful of food once in a while?

 perplexed by Mayor Murphy&apos;s statement in the News Barometer that commissioners and county staff have spent far too much time and 
 energy on No Name Key. Don&apos;t these citizens of Monroe County count? And 
 what about their time and money spent trying to get their rights and 
 something as simple and basic as electricity? The county commissioners 
 knew in the old lawsuit in 1999 to 2003 that the residents had a right 
 to electricity. Why do you think that the then county attorney who 
 recommended the Court Settlement which the Board rejected, then 
 supported the motion to vacate the summary judgment? The county knew 
 about the 1951 Resolution giving Keys Energy (formerly City Electric) 
 the right to use all of Monroe County&apos;s roads, bridges, right-of-ways 
 for providing electricity. Likewise, Keys Energy knew that it had the 
 sole and absolute right to bring electricity to the island because the 
 State of Florida Legislature approved so in Chapter 65-1770. Yes, since 
 1965 the county has not had any right to interfere with Keys Energy 
 bring electricity to No Name Key.  What surprises me is that those folks 
 haven&apos;t already sued for damages and why are they paying for it. The 
 county has paid, except for developers for large projects, for bring 
 electricity to single family homes. In fact, the state law requires the 
 county to pay for providing the infrastructure needed to provide this 
 service to the homeowners.
 
So Mayor Murphy, it is you that is wasting everyone&apos;s time and money. You are leading the county into another lawsuit that cannot be won and 
 you have no regard for the taxpayers&apos; pocketbooks, much less the rights 
 of the homeowners on No Name Key who have had the right to electricity 
 since 1951. You are beating a dead horse, but I&apos;m sure the political 
 punishment will continue until you bankrupt the taxpayers or your next 
 election date.

 in the face of speakers that it is unconscionable what the residents put 
 up with from their elected officials. Its disgusting. Why should some 
 commissioners treat us like bad little kids who showed up just to annoy 
 them? Some just don&apos;t get it. As long as Mayor Murphy and Wigington are

 School System!) for two years. He then attended a Catholic School for 
 two years. Gosh, maybe that makes him Catholic! George Bush dressed in 
 a Vietnamese costume with the leaders of the country during his visit. Gosh, maybe that makes him Vietnamese! Hillary Clinton always wears a 
 head scarf when she visits Muslim countries. Gosh, maybe that makes her 
 Muslim! I recently went to the Bahamas and participated in the Boxer 
 Christmas Parade. I wore a mask. Oh gosh, maybe that makes me 
 Bahamian! Barack Obama met his father a couple of times in his life. If his father was a Muslim, does that make him one? Is religion 
 hereditary?  Sarah Palin was born into a Catholic family. She changed 
 to the Pentecostal Church and then to the Bible Church. Gosh, is she 
 still Catholic? Maybe President Obama isn&apos;t African-American at all. Since he is half white and his mother was raised in Kansas, maybe he is 
 a Kansas-American.  

 Are we all supposed to agree with the leaders of the countries that 
 might be part of our heritage? I wonder if all Cubans agree with 
 Castro. Does that mean President Obama must agree with the Kenyan 
 leader?  If I moved to the Keys in the 80&apos;s, what am I? A Freshwater

 Speed ] On the way from Tokyo to Atlanta last week we&quot;rode&quot;the jet stream 
 taking advantage of a 200kt tail wind which gave us a ground speed of 
 707kts. We got a call from one of the flight attendants who was asked 
 by a passenger if the speed on his passenger entertainment screen was 
 correct indicating 813MPH (which is 707kts). I told her it was 
 correct.  
 The phone rang a moment later and the same flight attendant wanted to 
 know how we could go that fast. Realizing a dissertation in meteorology 
 and physics would be about as productive as having my dog watch the

[ Extreme Shepherding ] Truly, I have never seen anything like 
 this, and never expected to! http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1137883380?bctid=17075685001   
 [ From the Right] I have a great deal of respect 
 for Mr. Neugent, he is a fine public servant. He has served his 
 constituency honorably and with competence. He has my political support, 
 but (and its a big but), I must disagree with the theme of his recent 
 writings in the Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel . Mr. Neugent provided 
 us with anecdotal subjective observations of various low lands 
 throughout the Keys. Fortunately in the Keys we have a totally objective 
 frame of reference to gauge the current sea levels as compared to a 
 century ago. But first; Mr. Neugent is correct in his assertion that sea 
 levels are rising. Sea levels have been rising since the formation of 
 seas. During the geologic yesterday of our ice age, the Gulf coastline 
 was scores of miles further offshore than today. On the Atlantic side 
 the coast line was offshore of the current reef line. Our world and its 
 climate are never static. Climate is in constant flux. Mr. Neugents 
 comments recognize that our chain of islands are made from ancient reefs 
 that once were deep under the ocean. I recall a fairly recent article 
 in the Citizen that discussed the discovery of a forest somewhere 
 west of the Dry Tortugas that was completely submerged in about 40 feet 
 of water. The data discloses that sea level rise at Key West has been 
 rising at a rate of about 0.19 mm per year or about 0.56 feet in the 
 last one hundred years. More importantly, the mean rate of rise has been 
 nearly constant since 1850. We actually have a means to check that out 
 for ourselves. The Florida State Archives have a number of photos 
 showing the construction of Flaglers bridges at about the turn of the 
 19 th /20 th centuries. The attached photo was taken 
 about 1900 from the East end of Knights Key Bridge (7 Mile Bridge) which 
 was then under construction.  

 The archives 
 are full of similar photos. It is a simple task to go to the same 
 vantage point and compare the freeboard of the abutment collars in 1900 
 and today, 110 years later. I looked at the abutments at different 
 times during the tide cycle, and can discern little or no difference 
 between then and now. If there is a substantial change in the sea level 
 at the bridge abutment, it cannot be seen. Ive done the same exercise 
 with other photos from the archives with identical results. The 
 empirical evidence is clear; there is no robust evidence of accelerating 
 rate of sea level rise in the last 100 years. Mr. Nugent suggests that 
 Global Warming has precipitated an increase in Hurricane activity. 
 That does not appear to be accurate. Indeed our government in a press 
 release clearly says: There is no clear trend in the annual numbers of 
 tropical cyclones.&quot;There is no evidence for a long-term increase in 
 North American mainland land-falling hurricanes. Mr. Nugent spoke of 
 low lands flooding and suggested that man has contributed to that 
 flooding. I would remind Mr. Nugent that Key West has a rich history of 
 street flooding from even moderate thunderstorms as long as their has 
 been a newspaper in Key West. The archives provide the stories. The 
 current reports of flooding in other parts of the county are valid, but 
 anecdotal, and we must remember as recently as 30 years ago the Keys had 
 substantially less population than today. Subdivisions that are now 
 populated were vacant. Some roads were rarely traveled. The entire 
 notion of man caused global warming is now under deep suspicion. The 
 settled science has been found to be product of questionable methods, 
 politics, fraudulent data, and even lost or destroyed primary data. 
 That data having gone missing when its validity was challenged. Yet 
 another scientist has proved that the fraction of man caused c02 in our 
 atmosphere has not changed appreciably in the last 150 years. There is 
 strong and growing evidence that the computer models that purport to 
 chronicle and predict global warming are faulty. During this past week a 
 UN scientist has reported that the world has entered a multi decadal 
 period of global cooling. That cooling precipitated by deep ocean 
 currents which, the scientists reports are the true engine of climate. 
 Mr. Nugent suggested that hurricanes are increasing in frequency. That 
 claim is not supported by government stats. A check will show the tracks 
 of Keys impacting tropical cyclones back in history to the 19 th century. A check of each decade from 1940 until the present for the 
 number of hurricanes per decade will show that in the decade beginning 
 in 1940 the number of hurricanes striking the keys was 6, the 50s= 2, 
 the 60s=7, the 70s=4, the 80s= 2, the 90s=5, 2000-2009=4. 

  I am of the 
 view that Keys sea levels are rising, but not at an alarming rate, and 
 that rate has been nearly constant over the last 150 years; the 
 frequency of Atlantic hurricanes is actually on the decline as evidenced 
 by our own recent experiences, climate change does exist. Global climate 
 history is one of warming then cooling cycles. There is strong, and 
 growing, evidence that we are now in a global cooling cycle. I believe 
 that these cycles are not man caused. Is the coast line of the 
 Keys different today than in geologic yesterday? Yes. Is that change 
 caused by mans influence on our climate? No. 

 (Part II) It&apos;s 
 a shame that far too many of our Democrat friends have no self respect. Worse, they have no respect for you, for history, or the truth. Far too 
 often the nonsense that they try to sell you is simply insulting. 
 Yesterday a poster proved that point when he wailed that the nasty 
 Republicans inherited a recession, then did nothing about for 8 
 years. A quick check of history reveals that GWB did inherit a 
 recession, then 9 months into his first term we suffered 9/11/01. During 
 the first months of his admin we were suffering the dot com bust. In 
 the first months of his admin, our GDP actual grew, then as a result of 
 9/11, it dropped, but by the end of his first year the GDP growth rate 
 was at 1.08%. During the balance of his first term, the GDP grew to a 
 top rate of growth of 4.10% . During his second term, until the 2006 
 election the GDP (quarterly) grew at a an average rate of about 3%. Then the change started! In 2007, the first year of Democratic control 
 of the nations purse strings, the GDP plummeted to -1.90%. GDP 
 growth for 2007, and 2008 never exceeded 2.0%. After a year of Democrat 
 control of the White House and the Congress, we still suffer negative 
 GDP growth. During the totality of the Bush admin, the unemployment rate 
 averaged about 5%, and never exceeded 6%. Today, the unemployment rate 
 exceeds 10%.Need I mention the record highs of our stock markets, under 
 the Bush administration? Need I mention we had a healthy and burgeoning 
 economy from 2001 until 2006. Q: What happened in 2006 that kicked our 
 economy onto the skids? A: The Democrat take-over of Congress. There is plenty 
 to criticize Mr. Bush about, but he and the Republicans lost control of 
 the economy after 2006.

 Did 
 you know giving pelicans fish carcasses, manatees a drink from a water

 Feeding Key 
 deer is harmful. Hand fed deer lose their natural fear of humans and 
 become easy targets for would-be poachers. Public feeding attracts deer 
 to roads and highways where they are killed each year by passing 
 motorists. Foods used in public feeding may have adverse effects on the 
 deer&apos;s behavior, reproductive capability, and even its physical 
 appearance. Feeding is usually centered in sub-divisions exposing the 
 deer to human-related accidents such as entanglement in wire or other 
 debris, accidental drowning in canals and harassment and attacks by 
 dogs. http://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/nkdgen1.pdfPublic

 [ No Name Key] During the old 1999 - 2002 No Name 
 Key lawsuit, neither the 1951 Reso. nor the controlling State Law were 
 presented into evidence for the court to consider. Should this issue go 
 back to the courts again, the parties and multiple counts will be based 
 on Federal and State Laws; not on the local land regulations drafted by 
 Ms. Putney. 

 NNK did not lose that old lawsuit. The Court ordered 
 mediation. The County agreed to a settlement which allowed electricity 
 to NNK. The County attorney&apos;s advice and opinion were overruled by the 
 BOCC, who rejected that agreed upon court settlement. The Judge based 
 on Intervenor&apos;s motion entered summary judgment for the intervenor.  The 
 Plaintiffs and County objected to the Summary Judgment and the last 
 action of the Court was to Vacate the Summary Judgment.   Therefore, the 
 Court has not issued a ruling on the issue of electricity to No 
 Name regardless of whats printed in the News~Barometer .  The 
 NNK persons involved at the time got tired, gave up and dropped the 
 litigation. The current majority of No Name residents will Not give up 
 because the law is on our side and past injustices must be corrected.  

 In 2001, then planning commissioner, Alicia Putney wrote 
 the now infamous&quot;CBRS prohibition&quot;during the middle of that lawsuit. She and (with her help) the County voted a law into place that 
 prohibited electricity to only No Name Key while the Putneys and 
 the County were in the mist of litigating against the residents of No 
 Name Key suing for electricity. Does that sound legal, moral or 
 ethical? 

 The current super majority of NNK is strong, organized, 
 prepared, and willing to fight for what&apos;s right. If forced to do so, we 
 will do it with the Federal and State law on our side.

 composition of the atmosphere, and thinning of the ozone layer (which 
 makes up a large part of the atmosphere), has already made a large part 
 of our biological heritage disappear forever and will eventually reach 
 the top of the food chain. The tunes will play on our iPods while human 
 population growth and industrialization march on, like the music on the 
 sinking Titanic, unless the course changes soon. The best hope is that 
 its not already past the tipping point, but there&apos;s no change in sight 
 yet. 
 Youve got to love Rush Limbaugh . He was bestowing 
 his usual rhetorical prose telling us how wonderful his treatment was 
 during his recent hospital stay. There was nothing wrong with him. I 
 truly believe that a first year medical student attending the University 
 of Phoenix could tell you theres nothing wrong. Its a medical miracle 
 someone found out a healthy man had nothing wrong. Whats next a truck 
 driver today was pulled over and actually had a license? Im thinking he 
 needed another prescription because his other 3-4 doctors got caught. 
 Maybe next he can visit Sarah Palins witch doctor and get the evil 
 spirits cast out.

 all ready for their boarding procedure. 
 [ Stinky Refrigerator ] Ive been there with this 
 stinky fridge thing. Save yourself a lot of frustration and throw it out 
 or turn it into a beer and bait fridge. The reason it still stinks is 
 that the smell gets into the insulation and no amount of baking soda or 
 cleaning will get rid of it. 
 


[ Restaurant review ] I also had lunch last Sunday at the new El

 At the recently held election of officers for the Iguana Killers Club, Kander Bluff was elected to the honorary chair 
 position as Imperial Lizard. At the board meeting it was decided that 
 there would be no need to have a treasurer, unlike other boards, as the 
 IKC has zero funds that its members could steal. Kander was selected 
 from a list of highly respected individuals because of her innovated 
 thinking towards the current iguana epidemic plaguing the Florida Keys. Bluff brings with her over 12 years of iguana hunting experience to the 
 IKC with an uncountable number of kills as verified from her rsum. Her new recipe book comes from working with the RKC, Road Kill 
 Connoisseur, Dr. Ludwig Will Scrape, who now permanently resides in the 
 Lower Keys. Bluff was instrumental in lobbying the local politicos to 
 get the Federal grant approved for purchasing the IKC41 scoped air 
 rifle. These top of the line, high powered rifles will be handed out 
 free to all current members at the next IKC meeting. Bluff was also 
 highly motivated in the recruitment drive as the IKC was has increased 
 its membership to 196 true sportsmen. Bluff started the junior division 
 of the IKC which has turned out to be a great success as now we have 17 
 young men and women engaged in the respected sport of hunting. Bluff is 
 currently working with the Local Ass of Fisherwomen to fund and study 
 the feasibility of using frozen iguana carcasses as bait for their 
 lobster and crab traps. Bluff has already started negotiations with a 
 locally owned business to package and market various edible portions of 
 iguana meat at locally owned stores. Bluff is also working with a 
 recognized South Florida University on a study to raise, slaughter and 
 sell the meat to various entities in the Caribbean Islands. The IKC is 
 proud to have Kander Bluff on the board of Directors and Im sure that 
 all the citizens of Monroe County will benefit from Kander Bluffs iguana 
 eradication endeavors.

 [ From the 
 Right ] If you think 
 the last couple of days were cold, then you aint seen nuttin yet. The 
 U.N. is on top of things again (see: facetious). One of the preeminent 
 members of the UN Committee on Climate Change has just announced that 
 the world is in the process of cooling, not heating. The scientist, 
 Professor Mojib Latif, of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
 Change (IPC), has, until now, been a passionate advocate for the notion 
 of Global Warming. Thats all changed; he now says that we are entering 
 into a multi decadal period of global cooling. His studies predict 
 20-30 or more years of cooling. His studies of deep sea ocean currents 
 have convinced him, and hundreds of other scientists, that it is these 
 currents, aka the global multi global oscillations that actually power 
 climate. He tells us that we are currently in an Arctic Oscillation mode 
 of the Multi Decadal Oscillation. All the fore going from the source 
 listed below. Additionally it is pointed out that at least 56% of the 
 earths surface is currently snow covered. Also noted is the report of 
 Colorados National Snow and Ice Data Center that Arctic sea ice has 
 increased by 26% since 2007. That report not denied by even the most 
 ardent Global Warmers. The issue of Cap and Trade is no longer a 
 matter of knee jerk response to false settled science which had 
 predicted sweltering doom and gloom. Maybe now we will start to learn a 
 lot more of just how much money Al Gore and his ilk were to have 
 profited from the fraud of Global Warming get rich schemes. Now the 
 science is telling us that we are subjected to forces that are beyond 
 our control and that now that we are cooling off, maybe we can drive a 
 stake through the vampire heart of Cap and Trade. Thats the Obama blood 
 sucking Cap and Trade which promises to increase the cost of living for 
 every American every year by several thousands of dollars. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1242011/DAVID-ROSE-The-mini-ice-age-starts-here.html 

 (Part 
 II) The photo of then Senator Obama dressed in African/Muslim garb was 
 taken during his visit to Kenya, his ancestral homeland in 2006. It was 
 taken during the same visit in which he speechified glowingly about a 
 Kenyan political leader, Raila Odingo, then candidate for Kenyan Prime 
 Minister, now the Prime Minister. Obama and Odinga sounded very much 
 like a mutual admiration society. Best Boy Friends. Odinga is a devoted 
 Muslim and is committed to Islamicizing the Kenyan government. 
 Islamicized governance means Sharia law. Now lets apply some Democrat 
 logic in analyzing the following facts: First: Sarah Palin has been 
 judged by a recent left wing poster to be a religious whakado involved 
 in witchcraft because she permitted herself to be blessed by a visiting 
 African preacher. Its vital to realize that the Palin prevaricator lied 
 about the circumstances of her being blessed by the African preacher.  Second: Barack Hussein Obama is the son of a Muslim, schooled in a 
 Muslim school, has expressed fondness and respect for the Muslim 
 religion, and he believes that the American nation has treated Muslims 
 badly. He is committed to the abandonment Gitmo of because it offends 
 Muslims, and he believes that terrorist attacks on the USA are crimes, 
 not acts of war. Therefore, Mr. Barack Hussein Obama, the President of 
 the United States, must be a ____________. If you can, be fair, you fill 
 in the blank by using only the Democrat logic used in the scurrilous 
 attack on Ms. Palin. http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=57363 .

 [ Stinky 
 Refrigerator ] We have a new refrigerator that I thawed scallops on 
 one of the shelves. Some condensation must have gotten in the 
 refrigerator because it stinks. I emptied it out of everything 
 including shelves, dividers, drawers, door racks, etc. everything 
 that could possibly be removed. I washed everything in a solution of 
 baking soda and water then washed it again with 409 to remove the 
 baking soda film. It still stinks. There arent any holes or vents 
 the scallop juice could have seeped into and I did an especially 
 good cleaning where the glass in the shelves meets the plastic 
 frame. Its been three weeks and it still stinks. 

 Have any of you ever had such an experience on one of 
 the newer refrigerators? The smell is awful, although after three 
 weeks is diminishing.

 [ Racist or Politics ] Harry Reid is under 
 attack for saying, before the election, Obama had a good chance of 
 being elected because he was light-skinned and didnt speak with a 
 Negro accent. 

 Have we taken political correctness to the point 
 where the Senate Majority leader, when trying to get a candidate 
 elected, cant speak of a very legitimate concern to many Americans, 
 and a positive trait in his opinion? 
 Iguanas are not native to Florida. They are here thanks to lax federal and 
 state laws regarding the pet trade, and to irresponsible pet owners 
 who loose their critters or simply let them go. Now certain alien 
 reptiles and snakes with no natural enemies are reproducing in the 
 Florida Keys. In a few years they have changed the ecology of a 
 place that has taken thousands of years to evolve. 

 Now we 
 have iguanas to go along with the deadly pythons and pit viper 
 rattle snakes and experts fear that humans one day you may end up on 
 their menu. It is only a matter of time. A state-sanctioned hunt was 
 licensed recently to reduce the python population estimated to be at 
 least 25,000 pythons. 

 Monroe 
 County might have more invasive iguanas than there are drunks, 
 attorneys, dope heads, realtors and lying politicians combined. 
 Killing off the invasive iguanas is good for the natural habitat of 
 the Keys. There is not much that can be done with the other five 
 categories due to their civil rights and an extremely lax court 
 system. Iguanas are wide spread throughout the county and there are 
 tens of thousands of them. Young iguanas are known to eat eggs of 
 protected sea turtles and numerous others of Gods living creations. 
 As adults, they dine on all native and non native floras. For 
 dessert they can devour your expensive landscape plants and orchid 
 trees within a few hours. Iguanas can burrow under houses and 
 undermine sidewalks and seawalls. 

 The Iguana 
 Killers Club does not recommend just running out, buying a gun and 
 shooting iguanas as you might only wound or cripple the creature so 
 you need to practice first so that you become a very deadly shot. 
 Gun safety and being humane towards all invasive reptiles are 2 
 important rules of engagement with the IKC. Iguanas are not 
 protected. It is not a crime. It&apos;s a ready meat source. You might

 [Obama Anti-American Trifecta ] The poster who regurgitated the lies he read from Republican web 
 sites is completely wrong. I don&apos;t consider any of this stuff 
 important, but I am really tired of Republican lies! Therefore, I 
 offer the following information to set the record straight.

Poster claims &quot;Obama is the only president in 110 years who did not 
 attend an Army-Navy football game&quot;. Wrong! Hoover, FDR, Johnson, 
 Nixon, Carter, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush were never present for 
 an Army-Navy football game.
Poster claims&quot;Obama is the only president to not attend a Christmas 
 Religious observance&quot;. Wrong! It is impossible to track the day to 
 day activities of every president in our history, but the following 
 modern day presidents did not attend a religious observation on 
 Christmas, Nixon, Johnson, Hoover, Wilson, T. Roosevelt.
Poster claims &quot;Obama is the only president who stayed on vacation 
 after an attempted terrorist attack&quot;. Wrong! President Obama left 
 Washington on Christmas Eve to spend his holidays with his family in 
 Hawaii and returned on Jan. 3. During these 10 days, he responded 
 to the attempted bombing incident by holding multiple briefings, 
 ordering reviews of airline screening procedures and US intelligence 
 and by giving a TV address to the Nation.  

 President Bush left Washington on Dec. 22 to spend 
 his Christmas vacation at Camp David. Later that afternoon the shoe 
 bomber attempted to detonate a bomb. President Bush remained at 
 Camp David and received briefings through Christmas Day and then 
 flew to the family ranch in Texas and didn&apos;t return to Washington 
 until Jan. 7 th . He was away on vacation for 16 days. 
 (President Bush, when informed of the terrorist attacks on 9/11 
 continued to read to school children about a goat.0

It&apos;s easy to fact check internet items these days. Smart people 
 don&apos;t believe everything they read. Who really cares if anyone goes 
 to church on Christmas anyway? Who cares if anyone goes to a 
 football game? Perhaps if our President had gone, he would have 
 been criticized for leaving his post to attend a game. Enough is 
 enough. Stop spitting out garbage and go fishing instead. 
 I 
 have a Madagascar lizard that has been on one of my porch 
 posts in the same position for three days. Usually the thing is a

 soft. 
 [ Global Warming ] I just stumbled on this 
 thread and really have nothing to do with BPK since I live in 
 Chicago, but I was intrigued by From the Right&apos;s insinuation that 
 there lurks some undisclosed truth behind the various phenomenon 
 collectively linked to the global warming issue. Please don&apos;t 
 insinuate; enlighten us all with your inconvenient truths. As they 
 say at my old alma mater,&quot; Emite Lucem et Veritatum &quot;so that 
 we may all be the wiser.

 [ County 
 Commissioners ] Residents deserve better. 
 Some County Commissioners lack critical thinking skills and it is 
 embarrassing to watch. Sometimes it would be funny if not such a 
 sorry state of affairs. For example, a Commissioner recently used 
 the equivalent of the childhood rhyme ennie-minnie-minie-moe to make 
 her decision on how to vote on an issue of substantial monetary and 
 legal consequences. After the last speaker the commission 
 said, &quot;You have sued, they have sued, so I just vote no.&quot; This 
 commissioner disregarded the advice of County staff and the County 
 Attorney and the citizens&apos; right-on an private property rights issue 
 that the taxpayers will end up paying over and over. 

 I hope voters are watching and paying attention. We 
 must elect public officials that are independent thinkers with an 
 un-biased ear, an open mind, and have some ability to think 
 critically.   
 The 
 Democratic racial double standard is on parade with Harry 
 Reid leading the way. I made a point that Obama and Oprah were 
 talking and acting like they were on the set of The Color Purple campaigning in Carolina. I got blasted for the comment. Now we learn 
 Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid described Obama as a&quot;light 
 skinned&quot;African-American&quot;with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted 
 to have one&quot;and that would help rather than hurt his eventual 
 presidential bid. Was Harry playing the race card and never attacked 
 for it? Why wasn&apos;t my comment enlightening about the racial 
 psychology in the country? 

 Where in the hell are all of those outraged liberals 
 vowing to stop racism now? They&apos;re tripping and stumbling all over 
 their double-talking tongues doing damage control. How can we blame 
 Bush for this? There has to be a way that it must be all Bush&apos;s 
 fault. Sharpton says Reid&apos;s remarks&quot;are enlightening about the 
 racial psychology in the country&quot;. Say What? Some folks are saying&quot;Harry is just stating a fact&quot;. So was I. Where&apos;s the outrage from 
 Jackson, the New Black Panthers, Black Caucus and all the other 
 legions of warriors out to defeat racism? Their heads are up their 
 asses hoping this blows over and doesn&apos;t shut down Obamacare. Some 
 are still staking out Imus waiting to bash another non-Democratic 
 white guy racist. 

 A Liz Cheney comment says it all,&quot;I just want to 
 point out that I think one of the things that makes the American 
 people frustrated is when they see time and time again liberals 
 excusing racism from other liberals.&quot;Bingo, lady, you got it! This 
 is the same party guilty of racism in the way they handle inner city 
 schools and entitlement programs. Yo, liberals, an old white man 
 insulted and belittled a black man who was trying to become the 
 president of the United States. Where are your vicious attacks on 
 that white bastard? To those who might perceive this as an angry and 
 bitter post, you&apos;re only half right.

 Murphy and another commissioner cited an outside, unsolicited,

 the County Attorney&apos;s opinion. 
 This peaked my interest. I 
 don&apos;t know Mr. Grosso who wrote that so-called legal opinion, but I 
 got a copy of his letter to read for myself. It is a disservice to 
 all taxpayers that commissioners even read this letter. Taxpayers 
 pay for a whole office of County attorneys whose responsibility is 
 to give researched legal advice to the Board to keep the County out 
 of lawsuits. Here is an outsider giving his two-cents worth and I 
 would give his letter a grade of F. Any student who has taken 
 civics understands the difference between a resolution and an 
 ordinance, but Grosso attempted to explain it as if commissioners 
 were at their first day in kindergarten or brain dead. The letter is 
 condescending and insulting, to say the least. The frosting on the 
 cake was when Grosso put a disclaimer that&quot;this letter is not an 
 exhaustive legal analysis, [but], at a minimum, should be 
 specifically analyzed and addressed by the Countys legal staff.&quot;  

 Mr. Grosso and 
 Commissioners, the County Attorney has done extensive research and 
 given a legal opinion that will stand up in court. An old adage 
 provides that free legal advice is worth exactly what you pay for 
 it. Don&apos;t create more litigation that the taxpayers must pay. 
 Taxpayers have had enough.

 [ God ] 
 Some missed him. Some miss him still. We expect God to speak through 
 peace, but sometimes he speaks through pain. We think God talks 
 through the church, but he also talks through the lost. We look for 
 the answer among the Protestants, but hes been known to speak 
 through the Catholics. We listen for him among the Catholics but 
 find him among the Quakers. We think we hear him in the sunrise, but 
 he is also heard in the darkness. We listen for him in triumph, but 
 he speaks even more distinctly through tragedy. We must let God 
 define himself. When we do, when we let God define himself, a whole 
 new world opens before us.

 [ From the Right ] Last Saturday a poster attempted to 
 blur Mr. Obamas 20 or so year record of enthralled attention to Rev. 
 Wrights grotesquely racial and anti American sermons. That poster attempts 
 to excuse Mr. Obamas acceptance of Rev. Wrights mentorship of Mr. Obama 
 and his family. God Damn America The chickens have come home to roost. 
 The posting suggested that Ms. Palin had the same level of devotion for a 
 Rev. Muthee, an African Christian Evangelist, as did Mr. Obama for Rev. 
 Wright. It would appear that the Obama acolyte is of the view that if Ms. 
 Palin is a whackadoo religious nut, then it is just dandy that Mr. Obama is 
 a radical whackadoo racist religious nut, who is enthralled with racial 
 revenge and hating America. That was the message of Rev. Wright. I can find 
 only two videos on topic that record the actual words and actions of Murthee 
 and Palin. The first shows Ms. Palin, being blessed by Rev. Muthee on the 
 altar of a church. Please take careful note of what the Rev. Muthee says: he 
 speaks of God, love, devotion, and worship. Murthees words, Thank you 
 Jesus, lets all pray for Sara. Deer friends, I urge to also seek out the 
 video of Ms. Palin speaking about Rev. Murthee and the foregoing episode. 
 Please ignore the donkey dung from the various commentators and listen only 
 to the words of Ms. Palin and Rev. Murthee. I did, I choose to make my own 
 decisions. Ms. Palins words lasted about 39 seconds. Ms. Palin remarks 
 largely centered on Rev. Murthee being bold.  In places she sounds as if 
 she were mocking Murthees voice. She says that his words were powerful. Ms. 
 Palin thanked Rev. Murthee for his words. Ms.. Palin has not been a regular 
 attendee of that Church since 2002, Rev. Murthee is not the pastor of that 
 church, he is only an occasional guest speaker. As to the Witchcraft: Rev. Murthee in fact does denounce witchcraft. He actually works against 
 the practice. It is a serious problem in Africa, with some self proclaimed 
 witchs actually engaging in human sacrifice and cannibalism. Are we to 
 assume that yesterdays poster is of the belief that Murthees denouncing 
 witchcraft if a bad thing? Yesterdays Obama acolyte suggest that Murthee was 
 anti Semitic, and by extension that Ms. Palin is anti Semitic. I can find 
 nothing on the web attributed to Murthee in support of that charge. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwkb9_zB2Pg 

 (Part II) Weve 
 just learned from a peeved poster that Rush Limbaugh is very, very wealthy 
 and he likes our existing health care delivery system. Now that is really big news! Who knew? Who could have known? I&apos;ll bet that the 
 peeved poster doesn&apos;t know that 85% of us also are satisfied with the 
 quality and availability of our health care. 40% of the uninsured are young 
 folks who simply choose not to buy health insurance. About 20 or percent of 
 the uninsured make enough money to purchase health insurance but just decide 
 not to buy it. Now heres where it gets gritty: About 25 % of the uninsured 
 are already eligible for publicly funded assistance for health care, but 
 just dont make use of it. About 21 or so percent of the uninsured are 
 immigrants, both legal and illegal. It&apos;s a safe bet that the peeved poster 
 didn&apos;t now that as of 12/29, only 39% of Americans approved of Obamacare. 
 Well anyway, he does now.

[ Free Hot Soup ] The 
 shelter at St. Peters Church on BPK will be serving chili soup to those 
 needing a free, hot meal. Serving time will begin at 1:00 on Sunday 
 afternoon and continue through 7:00 pm. 
 [ High 
 Definition TV ] Im always angry when I receive my DirecTV bill because 
 they always charge me more than they did on the last months bill, but no 
 more. I had FL Keys Satellite install a high definition dish for my existing 
 DirecTV account and the brilliance is worth any billing hassles. 

 I even find Im 
 watching crappy programming because it looks so good. The difference from 
 regular TV and HDTV is like night and day. Another bonus is that with the 
 new dish the TV doesnt go out during heavy rains. 
 The Googles new phone , Nexus1 cost more up front, but you can use any

 [ God 
 Infallible ] Rabbi Kushner author of When Bad Things Happen to good 
 People has a new book out where he says natural disasters are caused by 
 Nature not God! Religious leaders have been changing the idea of God since 
 people started questioning His existence. Now all of a sudden hes trying to 
 take responsibility away from God. The common belief is that god in 
 omnipresent and controls everything. If God doesnt control Nature than He 
 is fallible, thus not a god.

[ Key West Tour Vehicles ] Its a good thing that HTAs monopoly on 
 tours is over, but the City did it wrong. They should have reduced the 
 number of HTAs vehicles by half and given those allotments to the new 
 company Cityview. The streets are too narrow for the number of vehicles the 
 City Commission allowed. 
 [ IKC ] If 
 you are running out of unemployment benefits, homeless, just plain lazy or 
 recently fired for some criminal act that you say you didnt really commit 
 and still awaiting trial, there is no need to go meatless with all these 
 iguanas, Burmese pythons and Eastern diamond back rattlesnakes roaming 
 around your neighbor hood. There could be an iguana in every pot. If you can 
 eat any of the following: gator, chicken, pythons, pigs, deer, rabbit, 
 buffalo, horse, cow or dog, you certainly can eat iguana. 

 Join the Iguana 
 Killers Club and become a member of Lunatics Anonymous as they always have a 
 supply of fresh and frozen meat products. There is a potential for a new 
 market for the slaughtered iguanas; they could be sold to the commercial 
 fisherman as bait for their traps. There are over 100,000 lobster and crab 
 traps in the Florida Keys waters so there is a demand for inexpensive bait. 
 There is also iguana culture to think about, where iguanas could be breed 
 and processed as a edible nutritious food source. 

 Don&apos;t look now, 
 but a deadly rattle snake just bit a python and the python is eating your 
 family dog which had just devoured a baby iguana which had just been bitten 
 by a recluse spider. Isnt living in paradise great.

 [ Some 
 Real Fancy Flying] There&apos;s nothing about this the pilot enjoys. If he 
 could have ejected at 100&apos; upside down and lived, he would have. Looks like 
 the afterburner kicks in while still vectored for vertical takeoff. Lockheed 
 would call this a&quot;software malfunction&quot;and do a little more&quot;regressive 
 testing&quot;. Good demo of power-to-weight ratio of this aircraft! And stability 
 control. If he didn&apos;t come out of the loop wings-level, probably would have 
 been bad news, maybe taking some of the carrier with him! Flying through 
 your own exhaust can lead to equipment malfunctions, too! As in&quot;flame out&quot;F-35 is single engine, unpowered and zero airspeed has aerodynamics of a 
 Steinway piano. This is the most unbelievable piece of flying you will ever 
 see in your life. 

 This is how a 
 supremely well-trained US Navy pilot, ice running in his veins instead of 
 blood, fully regains control of his $70 million fighter jet, after a 
 problematic vertical take-off attempt. Watch as the rear vertical thruster 
 fires to cause the problem. Video 
 [ Sewers ] If 
 feds say no to No Name Key, Big Pine Key can kiss sewers good-bye. If FWS 
 doesn&apos;t allow No Name Key/Keys Energy to dig a few dozen holes (for elec. 
 poles) in the rock beds along the road, then you can bet your last dollar 
 that FWS can not and will not allow Big Pine Key to be completely dug up for 
 central sewers. 

 BPK and NNK both have to deal with FWS because of the deer. 
 If FWS says a few holes are going to harm or threaten the deer, then there 
 is no way they can justify or allow the much larger sewer project for Big 
 Pine Key. The 5,000 on Big Pine Key best start hoping FWS allows the 40 on 
 NNK to have electricity, or we&apos;re all toast! 
 
Fish catching dog . Video I am a happy, healthy member 
 of AA . I believe in God not a Wish Granting Genie, Sky Wizard or Santa 
 Claus God, just the God of all creation. Some might call that Intelligent 
 Design. I have no use for such bourgeois terms. My relationship is personal. 
 I believe that the moment I try to ascribe any human characteristics or see 
 God via a human construct, I no longer believe in God, just the God 
 industry. 
 To the Bible thumper who has many good reasons for why Im 
 going straight to the devil through AA, thank you. Im sure you think youre 
 being helpful, even insightful. You prove the point that one goes to heaven 
 for the climate and hell for the company.  

 To the person who says I should take the credit for 
 staying sober and not give it to AA -- you couldnt be more wrong. That 
 you would presume to have any idea of how I proceeded on my journey through 
 recovery is, frankly, shocking. Do me a favor, dont take my inventory. If 
 you think this is about willpower, you obviously understand nothing about me 
 or addiction, and thats being kind. 

 I am continually astounded by those who want to tell me 
 how Ive stayed clean and sober for 5 years, when I have no real idea. I 
 cant tell you how I did it because it would be like trying to explain a 
 miracle. I can tell you things started to change when I finally began to 
 understand how important it was to be honest, open-minded and willing. When 
 it became more valuable to be serene rather than right on every issue; and 
 when I began to see how even an agnostic could benefit from daily prayer and 
 meditation. Thats just some of what I learned in rehab and AA. They dont 
 teach a magic willpower formula in those places; to do so would imply that I 
 have some potential to control my substance abuse when 30 years of 
 progressive using, despite the dire consequences, clearly proved I didnt. 
 To state it simply; stopping drinking doesnt prove a thing. Anyone can 
 stop. Its the starting again thats the problem.  

 And to those who will no doubt continue to ridicule me and 
 my fellows, point out AAs dismal recidivism rate, damn me to hell, tell me 
 Ive replaced one crutch with another, been brainwashed by a cult, you may 
 all be absolutely correct. Well see. You all seem so wrapped up in proving 
 something to me and others like me when weve already moved on and are 
 simply living the proof. (And if you really want to make a point, Im really 
 impressed by proper spelling.)

 Im so tired of the blatant lies and exaggerations the 
 Republicans keep spewing. They think Americans are downright stupid. Former 
 republican Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani went on national television 
 and proclaimed&quot;No domestic terrorist attacks happened on American soil 
 during the Bush administration&quot;. For heavens sake the 9/11 attacks that 
 killed over 3000 thousand Americans happened almost 25% of the way into 
 Bushs first term! The entire Party is rife with liars that think Americans 
 are so stupid that they dont know whats happening. The entire lying party 
 should be disbanded and thrown onto the trash heap of history. Thats 
 blatant lying, folks, no two ways around it. Hes disgraceful and he owes 
 every American that had a family member killed in that terrible attack an 
 apology. 9/11 was on Bushs watch--period.

 [ No Heat ] On Friday our heat quit; not a good thing 
 considering the weather coming our way. At about four in the afternoon my 
 husband called Jon Threlkeld of All Rite A/C. He came over that afternoon 
 and diagnosed the problem. He needed a part that he did not have in stock. 
 He called his supplier in Miami and arranged to pick it up (in Miami) today. 
 He was at our house and had the part installed and the system operational by 
 3 this afternoon. That to me is superior service. He went out of his way to 
 take care of our system. He could easily have put us off until next week and 
 left us in the lurch, but he did not. Keep him in mind if you need heat or 
 AC service. 
 [ Change ] 
 To those bitching about this site or wanting change here, what are you 
 offering? If some posts are too long for you or don&apos;t interest you, skip 
 over them. Perhaps you could add some dazzling or witty posts that would 
 spur new conversations, new ideas or change our attitudes completely. Just 
 think, your comments might fundamentally transform all of our posting 
 habits; maybe even cause an awaking of our burned out brain cells that we 
 sacrificed so valiantly so we could keep on partying. 

 Please join in and lead us all to the lofty heights of your 
 domain. We all really want to be better people so badly. Please show us the 
 way. Lead us to the light so we may excel and learn to please you. We will 
 be looking to the heavens in anxious anticipation awaiting your divine 
 posts. 

 Please forgive us if we are in awe of your post&apos;s content and 
 it takes us a few days to reply. Unlike you, we are just mere mortals 
 fighting to get through life one day at a time.  

 Ah, the hell with this sh*t, what did an actor named Ronald

 nothing. 
 


[ Winn Dixie out of Ketchup] Lighten up on Winn Dixie. It is not their

 [ From the Right ] 
 Votary: according to Webster, a noun: A devoted admirer; or a devoted or 
 zealous worshiper; or a staunch believer or advocate. Lets be honest, its 
 seductively easy to be a votary of Mr. Obama. His rags to riches story would 
 beggar belief if it were fiction. He is handsome, suave, intellectual, and 
 possessed of incredible speechifying talent. The paper thin veneer that he 
 has applied to his beliefs and policies shine like the finest burled walnut. 
 He says he embraces health care for all, he claims to champion justice, and 
 he promises less for the wealthy few and more for the downtrodden masses. It 
 most certainly sounds every bit as appealing as Mom and her famous apple 
 pie. His words are enchanting. But only until his veneer is breached. Wilma 
 came to visit us a couple of years ago, and left us with tons of beautiful 
 furniture and cabinetry that crumpled to trash when their thin veneers were 
 penetrated. If you scratch the veneer of Obamacare, you find a crumbling 
 faux-wood mess of national debt, higher taxes, and loss of benefits for 
 unionists, seniors losing benefits, and a decline in the amount and quality 
 of health care. You find health care that will you cost more. Then, of 
 course, there is the matter of his confident words in praise of his own 
 policies concerning Global Conflict and in Man Caused Disasters. Scratch 
 that veneer and you find dead Americans. You find attacks on the homeland on 
 the increase. You find a politically correct morass of absurdly ineffective 
 measures to keep us safe in our homeland. If you are of the view that any 
 politician or any poster is trying to mislead you, you really should take 
 the few moments necessary to educate yourself on both sides of the issue. 
 Remember, only you can permit yourself to be misled. For your own sanity, 
 you should never, repeat never, be an unquestioning believer. Then, if you 
 believe that you are being misled, you should do one of the most truly 
 patriotic and American things that you can do. You should speak out! CT 
 provides us with a remarkable forum to voice your beliefs. On CT, you can be 
 a hero by calling out the attackers of your Emperor. Or, you can be a 
 patriot by calling out the Emperor and his minions. Your views and truths 
 might well influence others in our community. But, most of you wont do 
 that. Hero worship, or being a votary, is seductively easy: it feels good, 
 its warm and it&apos;s fuzzy. When the Emperors nakedness is revealed, it is so 
 very easy to deny his nakedness rather than face the painful truth that the 
 object of your adoration is deeply flawed. The default position of those who 
 worship the Emperor is to strike out against the messengers who deliver the 
 news that their beloved Emperor is naked. A Naked Emperor stuck in the 
 frigid cold climate of the truth about&quot;Global Warming&quot;is not an inspiring 
 sight. Shrinkage is a bitch. 

 (Part II) Every now and then a posting comes along that 
 really deserves a loud chorus of kudos. Yesterdays posting that nailed bus 
 loads of left wing hypocrites was one of those great postings. The 
 hypocrites who routinely trashed Mr. Bush and now whine, piss, and moan when 
 a grown up makes a rational criticism of the Obama debacle have long 
 deserved a spanking. Yesterday, they got taken to the woodshed--big time. Who knew we had that kind of talent right here on little old BPK. A tip of 
 my hat for the talented poster

 Congratulations on your 5 years of sobriety. There is one problem 
 though. If reading quotes from the Bible makes you want to go out 
 and have a drink and do an 8 ball something is just not right. Maybe youre not working a good program. Could it be that the 
 program only works for 3% of the people that try it. Could it be 
 that you are only around AA and not really in AA? Or maybe you 
 didnt really come to believe. Are you trying to take an easier 
 softer way? Are you exactly where you should be? Did you not work 
 the 12 steps completely? Were you not completely honest with 
 yourself? Are you not thoroughly following the path of those that 
 came before? Did you leave something out of your moral inventory? Do 
 you not get down on your knees to pray? Are you not yet completely 
 brainwashed and indoctrinated into the devils cult? You are being 
 deceived. The devil that resides in Alcoholics Anonymous is walking 
 you away from God. The God that you are praying to is the God of 
 your understanding, the devil, not the son of Christ. You are 
 working the devils program. Thats what he wants. The devil wants 
 you in AA because that is his program. The devil wants you to 
 believe in false prophets. Keep working the 12 steps to hell. You 
 are not being honest to God as you are residing with the devil. Keep 
 following those that have already followed the path to hell. Luke 13:24, Strive to enter through the 
 narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not 
 be able. 

 God 
 didnt pour the devils blood down your throat, you did.  
 Gel coat stain. First you have to know what is making the stain. If is 
 it&apos;s organic you need bleach or a bleach based cleaner. If it is a rust 
 stain or a blood stain you will need an acid based cleaner like ospho. if the stain is oil based then a detergent base is needed. if you try 
 all of those than the stain might be imbedded in a porous weathered gel 
 coat. then a soft scrub or compound is needed to abrade the gel coat 
 down past the stain. hope that helps.  Bold Cold Wisdom does come with age;  including honesty,

 ENOUGH 
 Double Talk Lefties! For 8 yrs Obama, the Democrats&amp;their 
 psycho left wing nuts savagely&amp;relentlessly attacked GW Bush 
 on everything! Now those SAME lefties are whining, whimpering&amp;crying like hurt, spoiled little babies. They say criticizing 
 Obama in any way is racist, degrading the presidency of the USA&amp;bad for America! People are only attacking Obama &apos;cause he&apos;s 
 black, NOT because his policies Suck! Enough! To top it off, NOW 
 president Obama himself, Bush&apos;s biggest vocal critic, has the 
 cohoneys to tell Americans We MUST ALL Come Together! What The 
 Hell has changed Mr. president?   Could it be NOW that&quot;You&quot;are the target of 
 America&apos;s Anger, Not Bush&amp;you are freaking out&amp;starting to 
 panic? Tough luck sir, it comes with the job, just ask Bush! How 
 about taking like a man, Bush took far worse than your 
 getting... for now. It appears Obama&apos;s lefties are feeling&quot;a 
 bit left out&quot;. What happens when the folks in this clip turn on 
 the chosen one? Will that make THEM racists too? You Betcha&apos; it 
 will, but they won&apos;t be called that! It&apos;ll just be dissent in 
 the party right? BULL....!   What many people have never seen is how the 
 lefties show their respect for America&apos;s presidents. So view the 
 clip than ask yourself this; How can people who degraded, 
 disgraced&amp;called for&quot;THE DEATH&quot;of an American president be 
 so upset when people disagree with this president? For far too 
 long lefties were the only verbal, angry protesters so they 
 never felt the heat. Well times are a changing!   Once upon a time the young, violent, psychotic 
 left were the only ones protesting a president&apos;s policies. Now 
 moms, dads, grandparents&amp;conservatives of all ages are fed up. 
 They&apos;re marching&amp;protesting too! Hell, your mom, dad&amp;grandparents may be out there protesting this administration, 
 have you checked? Watch the left wing whiners of today 
 respecting our last president. The sound track is from a San 
 Francisco anti-Bush protest while the pictures are from multiple 
 left wing gathering honoring an American president. Video 
 I asked the poster to&quot;move on&quot;when he ranted and raved about Rev. Wright. After all, that 
 was 2 years ago! But....he asked me to give some information on Sarah 
 Palin&apos;s crazy church...so here it is.  
  Sarah Palin attends 
 the Pentecostal Church in Wasilla. Thomas Muthee is a regular preacher 
 at this church and is from Kenya. He denounces witchcraft and conducts 
 ceremonies to rid people of witch spells. There is a You-tube video of 
 him ridding Sarah Palin of spells. On June 8th, Palin, in a speech to 
 the church, thanked Muthee for helping her get elected Governor of 
 Alaska. Muthee was shown laying hands on Palin. He told the 
 congregation that Christians needed to take over the business world, 
 especially banking, just like the Jews. He stated that non-Christians 
 are ruining the banking industry and is the cause of the recent economic 
 scandal. So.....there&apos;s the information that you requested. Pretty 
 scary stuff. I, personally, wouldn&apos;t choose Wright or Muthee. But...it 
 is amazing to me that the Republicans continue to talk about Rev. Wright 
 and seem to ignore the witchcraft guy!

 fly in the sky thus airplanes are birds&quot;. You start off with what sounds as an appropriate comment then 
 you start to twist it to read different then what the intended 
 meaning meant until the conclusion the writer reaches at the end 
 seems to sound logical.Its just another way of twisting someone 
 your bashings words until their complete intent is removed.They 
 set you up, twist the wording into their logic and there you 
 go.Nicely packaged hate propaganda against their target.Well

 What follows 
 are direct quotes from Mr. Obamas Deputy National Security 
 Adviser for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, John Brennan. 
 The comments came during a press briefing after Mr. Obamas 1/07/10 
 speech.  Mr. Brennan 
 was handpicked by Mr. Obama to be his closest advisor on terrorism 
 and security. Essentially he is a Czar appointed by Mr. Obama. In 
 the press briefing Brennan was asked to give his assessment of the 
 systems that he maintains for the President as they relate to the 
 Christmas attack. What follows are a few of his comments: -- and 
 this is what the review sort of uncovered -- that we had a 
 strategic sense of sort of where they were going , but we 
 didn&apos;t know they had progressed to the point of actually launching 
 individuals here. And we have taken that lesson, and so now we&apos;re full on top of it. our review has looked at what 
 transpired before then. Since then I think we have all sort of 
 recognized that the government, the intelligence community, the 
 homeland security community, has worked seamlessly well.  And we 
 were in constant contact with one another throughout the period and 
 the week after the attack. .   Then there is the fact that Mr. 
 Brennan urged his subordinate, Michael E. Leiter, 
 Director of the National Counterterrorism Center not to 
 cut short his vacation and return to manage his responsibilities 
 immediately after learning of the Christmas bombing. Folks that is 
 simply incredibly bad judgment. Both Brennan and Leiter should be 
 fired for that alone. Then there is the fact that since 9/11/01 
 there has been a total of 131 Jihadist attack plots on the US. 41 
 of them on Mr. Obama&apos;s watch.   Good Lord folks; this bozo, Brennan, 
 is actually frightening. He is the person in charge of keeping us 
 safe. Its mind numbing that he can blithely tell us that he sort 
 of knew where they (terrorist) were going and what they were 
 doing. If he had an iota of honor, he would tender his resignation. 
 He admits that he knew that the intell existed, he admits that they 
 had a notion that Jihadists were planning a hit and it could be 
 here, but he still didnt move heaven and earth to head it off. He 
 actually instructed key management personnel go on vacation. He knew 
 that our enemy was on the move, he knew that the Fort Hood attack 
 was a Jihad attack, and still he let his troops snooze. Then, even 
 worse, he opines that his system worked seamlessly well. He 
 actually sounded proud. He brags that his minions are all fully on 
 top of it. Goddamn gang, this is unconscionable!  Even Barney Fife 
 would have done better. It is getting really scary. And still Mr. 
 Obama insists he has confidence in Brennan. And still Mr.. Obama 
 insists on treating these soldiers of Jihad who are waging war on 
 you and me as nothing more than common criminals. The Obama admin 
 has now announced that it will be the IRS in charge of keeping track 
 of and enforcing the mandatory health insurance purchases under 
 Obamacare. Are you sure that you want these people being in charge 
 of your health.

 There have been numerous articles 
 in the South Florida newspapers lately about how this cold weather is 
 having an effect on the invasive iguana epidemic that is plaguing the 
 Keys. The iguanas seem to go comatose in the cold weather and fall out 
 of the trees or off the roof. They just lay there looking like they are 
 dead. As soon as the weather warms up the iguanas come back to normal 
 life and continue to devastate the natural and imported flora of the 
 beautiful Florida Keys. 

 When the iguanas are in that 
 comatose state that is the best time to apply the rules of engagement as 
 set down by the Iguana Killers Club under the leadership of our newly 
 elected president. One quick shot to the head at point-blank range with 
 your high powered IKC91 rifle. Death is instantaneous. Never a miss. Please follow the ethical guide lines of the IKC for proper disposal of 
 the carcasses.  
 Cisco is bottled by the nation&apos;s second largest wine company, Canandaigua Wine 
 Co., in Canandaigua, NY and Naples, NY - the same company as Wild Irish 
 Rose. 

 Known as&quot;liquid crack,&quot;for its reputation for wreaking 
 more mental havoc than the cheapest tequila.  Something in this syrupy 
 hooch seems to have a synapse-blasting effect not unlike low-grade 
 cocaine.  The label insists that the ingredients are merely&quot;citrus wine&amp;grape wine with artificial flavor&amp;artificial color,&quot;but anyone who 
 has tried it knows better.  Tales of Cisco-induced semi-psychotic fits 
 are common.  Often, people on a Cisco binge end up curled into a fetal 
 ball, shuddering and muttering paranoid rants.  Nudity and violence may 
 well be involved too.  Everyone who drinks this feels great at first, 
 and claims,&quot;It&apos;s not bad at all, I like it.&quot;  But, you really do not 
 want to mess around with this one, because they all sing a different 
 tune a few minutes later.  And by tune, I mean the psychotic ramblings 
 of a raging naked bum.
 
In 1991, Cisco&apos;s tendency to cause a temporary form of inebriated 
 insanity led the Federal Trade Commission to require its bottlers to 
 print a warning on the label (above right).  The FTC also forced them to 
 drop their marketing slogan,&quot;Takes You by Surprise,&quot;even though it was 
 entirely accurate.  Read the FTC&apos;s full investigation on their own web 
 page.  Since those days, Cisco is harder to find outside the slums, 
 although the FTC&apos;s demonizing of the drink only bolstered its reputation 
 for getting people trashed.  Anyone who overlooks the warning and 
 confuses this with a casual wine cooler is going to get more than they 
 bargained for.  Cisco will make a new man out of you.  And he wants some 
 too. View: this link

 For all those men who say, Why 
 buy a cow when you can get the milk for free. Here&apos;s an update for you: 
 Nowadays, 80% of women are against marriage. Why? Because women realize 
 it&apos;s not worth buying an entire pig just to get a little sausage.

Men are like:
1. Men are like laxatives. They irritate the crap out of you.
2 Men are like bananas. The older they get, the less firm they are.
3. Men are like weather. Nothing can be done to change them.
4. Men are like blenders you need one, but you&apos;re not quite sure why.
5. Men are like chocolate bars. Sweet, smooth, and they usually head 
 right for your hips.
6. Men are like commercials. You can&apos;t believe a word they say.
7. Men are like department stores. Their clothes are always 1/2 off!
8. Men are like Government Bonds. They take so long to mature.
9. Men are like mascara. They usually run at the first sign of emotion.
10. Men are like popcorn. They satisfy you, but only for a little while.
11. Men are like snowstorms. You never know when they&apos;re coming, how 
 many inches you&apos;ll get or how long it will last.
12. Men are like lava lamps. Fun to look at, but not very bright.
13. Men are like parking spots. All the good ones are taken, the rest 
 are handicapped.

 23 Music Festival Benefits Calderwood Family After Fall. Cats are 
 known to land on their feet and apparently Calderwoods do too. Chris 
 Calderwood, a teacher at Island Christian School, fell off his one-story 
 roof Sept. 26 while clearing debris. He landed on both feet but 
 shattered both heels and the adjacent bones in the feet. After seven 
 hours of surgery and months of therapy, a full recovery is expected. The first 90 days he was bed-bound and only recently was allowed some 
 freedom in a wheel-chair. 

 To help the Calderwoods, Island Community Church and 
 Christian School is sponsoring the Keys Christian Music Festival 
 Saturday, Jan. 23 at Island Christian School located at 83400 Overseas 
 Highway in Islamorada. This all-day, outdoor music festival has 
 musicians lined up from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. In case of inclement weather, 
 the event is to be held in the new Family Life Center. Bulletin Board 
 [ Iguana Shipment Declined ] We the residents of 
 Orlando thank you for thinking of us as a possible home for your 
 iguanas, but will respectively decline. 
 [ AARP 
 Auto Insurance ] To this day, I don&apos;t know why it happened, but I 
 thought I&apos;d pass along what happened to me at renewal time last March. I have been with AARP The Hartford for many years, but when I received a 
 renewal premium for $1,283, I decided to check around on the internet. In addition to other sites, I went to the AARP site and reapplied. The 
 site quoted me a price of $974 for the same coverage! That was still 
 the best price I found.
 
This prompted me to place a call to AARP The Hardford&apos;s customer service 
 to question the disparity. The very nice woman searched through all 
 their information (no accidents, no violations) and did what she could 
 to determine why our renewal rate was so high, but even she couldn&apos;t 
 figure it out. So, she found my new quote and issued a new policy at 
 the reduced rate, a savings of $309 to me.
 
I had to complete additional paperwork for them as I was treated as a 
 new customer. What I also&quot;gave up&quot;is a reduction in some deductibles. 
 I had a $500 deductible that was down to $200-300 although not stated on 
 the policy, but since I don&apos;t have accidents, this savings was 
 worthless.
 
The moral of the story? Take some time to do your homework when it 
 comes to insurance. 
 [ Airport 
 Security ] The 
 nations that don&apos;t comply should not be able to fly into United States 
 airspace period. It&apos;s time to do away with political correctness and 
 start using common sense. EU nations divided on use of 
 airport body scanners 
 
Does anybody know where I can get Boo Boo Buddies ? A woman was 
 selling them at the Sugarloaf Craft Fair. They are hot or cool packs 
 that are handmade. They work great and are very cute. 
 [ Greed ] You know what makes me sick? The fact that 
 most people live on greed, pure uncaring greed. Take the fact of the 
 auto industry making cars with better gas mileage. This fact lights the 
 greed fuse for the merchant class in that they see more money available 
 to the public, so they raise prices on fuel and products to get more 
 profit. Greed will, and is killing this country. Wait until you people 
 have to pay $29.95 for a stinking Cheeseburger or let your kids run 
 around without diapers or walk to work, then you will wonder why your 
 butt hurts. 
 [ Badge 
 Power] DEA officer stops at a ranch in Texas , and talks with an old 
 rancher. He tells the rancher,&quot;I need to inspect your ranch for 
 illegally grown drugs.&quot; The rancher says,&quot;Okay, but do not go in that 
 field over there,&quot;as he points out the location. 

 The DEA officer verbally explodes saying,&quot;Mister, I have the authority 
 of the Federal Government with me.&quot; Reaching into his rear pants 
 pocket, he removes his badge and proudly displays it to the rancher. &quot;See this badge? This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish on 
 any land. No questions asked or answers given. Have I made myself 
 clear? Do you understand?&quot; 

 The rancher nods politely, apologizes, and goes about his chores. A 
 short time later, the old rancher hears loud screams and sees 
 the DEA officer running for his life chased by the rancher&apos;s big Santa 
 Gertrudis bull. 

 With every step the bull is gaining ground on the officer, and it seems 
 likely that he&apos;ll get gored before he reaches safety. The officer is 
 clearly terrified. The rancher throws down his tools, runs to the fence 
 and yells at the top of his lungs, &quot;Your badge. 
 Show him your badge! 
 [ Crappy Website ] My goodness! I&apos;ve tried reading your website 
 off and on, but the entries are way too long and fanatical. Whew, these 
 whackos need another forum. or maybe too just get a life. I&apos;m done 
 reading this...again. Carry on. 
 
The From Das Reich guy has tuned out any any voice but the one he 
 hears in his head. 
 Why do the majority of Midwestern snowbirds migrate to the 
 Florida west coast, but the northeast crowd goes to the east coast? Is 
 it because the Midwesterners can&apos;t stand the New Yorkers and therefore 
 avoid the east coast like the plague? I guess the Keys are in the middle 
 and have to endure both groups. Lucky us. [ Clean 
 and Sober ] Tomorrow with the help of AA Ill have been clean 5 
 years. The rather bilious rant from the anti-AA poster yesterday made me 
 want to take a drink and score an 8 ball for the first time in about 
 four years. The person who posted that perspicacious tripe must have old 
 Lucifer himself on speed dial. Only the devil would want to tempt me 
 back into that lifestyle again. The devil does, after all, like to mix 
 lies and truth to deceive us.    
 The IKC comments (pro and con) have been funny

 [ Duped ] A 49-year-old electrician has emerged as an unlikely 
 symbol of what can go wrong in the war on terror after authorities in 
 Slovakia planted an explosive in his backpack to test airport security - 
 then let it travel all the way to Ireland!

The incredible chain of events included a pilot taking off with the 
 explosives on board, the Slovaks&apos; failure to tell the Dublin airport or 
 police about the incoming ordnance, and the man&apos;s arrest days later as 
 Ireland&apos;s bomb squad closed in. 

 It all began Saturday when a policeman in Slovakia slipped 3.4 ounces of 
 plastic explosive into Stefan Gonda&apos;s check-in luggage at the 
 Poprad-Tatry Airport in central Slovakia as he and his wife were 
 returning home to Ireland after a Christmas visit. 

 Slovak authorities said the bomb material and a dummy that smelled like 
 explosives were hidden in the bag as a training test for a bomb-sniffing 
 dog, who pinpointed the fake but missed the real thing.

 and week after week doesnt it? Someone read the script very well. 
 Expect more President bashing tomorrow. Its the new cool thing to do. 
 [ B52-H ] 
 January 10, 1964, started out as a typical day for the flight test group 
 at Boeing&apos;s Wichita plant. Pilot Chuck Fisher took off in a B-52H with 
 a three-man Boeing crew, flying a low-level profile to obtain structural 
 data.

Over Colorado, cruising 500 feet above the mountainous terrain, the B-52 
 encountered some turbulence. Fisher climbed to 14,300 feet looking for 
 smoother air. At this point the typical day ended. The bomber flew into 
 clear-air turbulence. It felt as if the plane had been placed in a giant 
 high-speed elevator, shoved up and down, and hit by a heavy blow on its 
 right side. 

Fisher told the crew to prepare to abandon the plane. He slowed the 
 aircraft and dropped to about 5,000 feet to make it easier to bail out. 
 But then Fisher regained some control. He climbed slowly to 16,000 feet 
 to put some safety room between the plane and the ground. He informed 
 Wichita about what was happening. Although control was difficult, Fisher 
 said he believed he could get the plane back in one piece.

Response to the situation at Wichita, and elsewhere, was immediate. An 
 emergency control center was set up in the office of Wichita&apos;s director 
 of flight test. Key Boeing engineers and other specialists were summoned 
 to provide their expertise. Federal Aviation Administration air traffic 
 control centers at Denver and Kansas City cleared the air around the 
 troubled plane.
A Strategic Air Command B-52 in the area maintained radio contact with 
 the crew of the Wichita B-52.

As Fisher got closer to Wichita, a Boeing chase plane flew up to meet 
 him and to visually report the damage. When Dale Felix, flying an F-100 
 fighter, came alongside Fisher&apos;s B-52, he couldn&apos;t believe what he saw: 
 The B-52&apos;s vertical tail was gone.

Felix broke the news to Fisher and those gathered in the control center. 
 There was no panic. Everyone on the plane and in the control center knew 
 they could be called upon at any time for just such a situation. In the 
 emergency control center, the engineers began making calculations and 
 suggesting the best way to get the plane down safely. The Air Force was 
 also lending assistance. A B-52, just taking off for a routine flight, 
 was used to test the various flight configurations suggested by the 
 specialists before Fisher had to try them.

As high gusty winds rolled into Wichita, the decision was made to divert 
 the B-52 to Blytheville Air Force Base in Northeastern Arkansas. Boeing 
 specialists from the emergency control center took off in a KC-135 and 
 accompanied Fisher to Blytheville, serving as an airborne control 
 center. 

Six hours after the incident first occurred, Fisher and his crew brought 
 in the damaged B-52 for a safe landing.&quot;I&apos;m very proud of this crew and 
 this airplane,&quot;Fisher said.&quot;Also we had a lot people helping us, and 
 we&apos;re very thankful for that.&quot;  The B-52, Fisher said,&quot;Is the finest 
 airplane I ever flew.&quot;

 [ Valentine 
 to Osama ] Little Melissa comes home from 1st grade&amp;tells her 
 father that they learned about the history of Valentine&apos;s Day. &apos;Since Valentine&apos;s Day is for a Christian saint, and 
 we&apos;re Jewish,&apos; she asks, &apos;Will God get mad at me for giving someone a 
 valentine? Melissa&apos;s father thinks a bit, then says: &apos;No, I don&apos;t 
 think God would get mad. Whom do you want to give a Valentine to?&apos; &apos;Osama Bin Laden,&apos; she says. &apos;Why Osama Bin Laden?&apos; her father asks in shock. &apos;Well,&apos; she says, &apos;I thought that if a little American 
 Jewish girl could have enough love to give Osama a Valentine, he might 
 start to think that maybe we&apos;re not all bad, and maybe start loving people a 
 little bit. And if other kids saw what I did and sent Valentines to 
 Osama, he&apos;d love everyone a lot. And then he&apos;d start going all over the 
 place to tell everyone how much he loved them, and how he didn&apos;t hate 
 anyone anymore.&apos;

 Nights: Outdoor Movies at the National Wildlife Refuge
 Wednesday, January 13, 7-9pm,
Refuge Headquarters, Big Pine Key 

 Bring your lawn chairs Wednesday evening and see some 
 family friendly free movies ! 

 
The first short film IT&apos;S IN YOUR HANDS focuses on how FWC&apos;s marine 
 fisheries research and management are utilized to protect and conserve 
 Florida&apos;s fish and wildlife. The episode also highlights 
 catch-and-release and other conservation measures anglers can take to 
 protect and conserve Florida&apos;s fish and wildlife.

The second short film will be the PBS Changing Seas episode titled 
 SUPER GROUPER. Florida&apos;s underwater giants are back! After years of 
 over-harvesting, Goliath Grouper have made a noticeable resurgence off 
 of Florida&apos;s coasts. Changing Seas joins scientists in the field as they 
 study the life history of these awe-inspiring fish. Their goal is to 
 gain a better understanding of the species and the obstacles it faces on 
 the road to full recovery.

The evenings hour long feature film will be the Cousteau Adventure 
 Series episode of SHARKS AT RISK. For thousands of years, sharks have 
 haunted the human imagination. These perfect predators, 400 million 
 years in the making, are unique hunters with awesome power. But their 
 reputation as cruel, senseless killers of human nightmares is a far cry 
 from reality. These powerful creatures play a vital role in the 
 intricate balance that makes up the oceans&apos; ecosystem. Today, a new 
 predator, the human, puts these amazing creatures at risk, giving sharks 
 far more reason to fear us than we have to fear them.

 [ Obama 
 Speak with Forked-Tongue ] True or False? 
 President Obama addressed a major gathering of the American Indian 
 Nation in upstate New York. He expressed plans for increasing every 
 Native American&apos;s present standard of living. He referred to his time as 
 a U.S. Senator&amp;stated how he had voted for every Native American issue 
 that came to the floor of the Senate. The president was vague about the 
 details of his plans, yet spoke enthusiastically and eloquently. 
 At the 
 conclusion of his speech, the Tribes presented the president with a 
 plaque inscribed with his new Indian name,&quot;Walking Eagle.&quot;President 
 Obama proudly accepted the plaque&amp;then departed in his motorcade to a 
 fundraiser, waving to the crowds. A news reporter later asked the group 
 of chiefs how they came to select the new name they had given to the 
 President. They explained that&quot;Walking Eagle&quot;is the name given to a 
 bird so full of s**t it can no longer fly. All the reporter could do was 
 shake his head and walk away smiling. 
 [ Not Doing Well ] Our President and many of the folks he has 
 picked to run our country are not doing well. They appear to be very 
 out-classed, misinformed and disconnected with what is going on in the 
 real world. We all wanted change so very badly that I think we made a 
 hasty pick. This may have a golden lining, we could get mad and demand 
 more, much more from our employees. Lets see what the off-year 
 elections show.

 [ From the Right ] The President said many of the 
 right things in his speech concerning the Christmas attack on our 
 homeland. He wore his angry face and voiced his angry words. He talked 
 earnestly of responsibility and for the first time he acknowledged that 
 the buck stops at his desk. Did I miss an apology? Notwithstanding his 
 eloquence, he reported no discipline to be levied on his inept and 
 failed administrators. He reported no consequences to those who failed. 
 No consequences for outrageous ineptitude. No consequences and a 
 continuation of employment for those who refused to even cut short a 
 vacation in the wake of an enemy attack. No consequences for those who 
 failed to even recognize their failure. But for the grace of God, 
 hundreds would have died. Those Obama appointees, who so miserably 
 failed in the execution of their duties, still are charged with keeping 
 us safe in our home land. For the first time with his angry face and his 
 angry voice he admitted that we are at war. Yet he will continue to give 
 the strategic high ground of the American Criminal System to those 
 soldiers of Muslim fundamentalism who will and have attacked us. Once 
 again Mr. Obama wore calluses on the personal pro noun, I. He seemed 
 angrier that his administration had embarrassed him rather than the fact 
 that his administration failed you and me. His administrations failures 
 nearly killed hundreds. Now we must wait to determine if Mr. Obamas 
 actions mirror his rhetoric. How can we forget his repeated failures to 
 deliver on his campaign promises? I hold no hope for real change and I 
 fear for our safety. 

 (Part II) A 
 poster yesterday wrote that It is a great government that allows us to go way left for a few years, way right for a few years. The 
 poster is well meaning, but horribly wrong about that. It is absolutely 
 imperative for us to realize that it is not the government that allows 
 us to do anything. It is you and I and our Constitution that allows our 
 government to even exist. It is you and I that permit our legislators to 
 make our laws. I have the absolute right to voice my opinion 
 only because our founders had the courage to overthrow an all powerful 
 government. The entire purpose of our Constitution was to limit the 
 power of government. Here, in our little Coconut Telegraph we jawbone 
 about Left and Right politics and we fuss about Democrat and Republican. 
 Stripped to their bare essentials, Leftist believe in a powerful 
 government that has overarching control over our lives. Rightist believe 
 in a minimal government with only enough power to keep us safe. Leftist 
 believe that government grants rights and privilege to the governed. 
 Rightist believe that the government has only what power that we, the 
 governed loan to it. An ideal leftist government model would be strong 
 centralized government that controlled all human activity. An ideal 
 rightist government would have only the power that the governed loan to 
 it and then only sufficient power to keep us safe from one another, safe 
 in our homes, and safe from external threat. A leftist government could 
 prohibit yesterdays posters mention of thanking God. Its happening 
 right now. Our current President is a leftist. His actions prove it.

 [ Keys Energy Service ] We who are your customers 
 are paying you the highest rates in Florida for your services. I am 
 appalled at the condition of your properties, even your main offices in 
 Old Town looks like a run down building with broken windows and your sub 
 stations along the highway are an eyesore. Most of us in the Keys take 
 pride in our appearance, why don&apos;t you? 
 
It is a great government that allows us to go way left for a few 
 years, way right for a few years and settle down in the center with a 
 touch of right and a pinch of left for a few years. What a great and 
 fine nation we have built. God bless America and all the folks that make 
 it so very special. Good night Sloan, good night Sal. Hello mom&apos;s apple 
 pie, fishing and holding hands. 
 Finally, Cityview Tours was granted a franchise by 
 the City Commission last night to do business in Key West. Finally, Ed 
 Swifts Historic Tours of America (HTA) has competition the City 
 Commission and city staff wont try to run out of business like Duck 
 Tours was once run out of business by a previous City Commission and 
 city staff, which ended up costing the city close to $9,000,000 this 
 year ($8,000,000 court settlement and nearly $1,000,000 in legal 
 expenses, court costs).
 
Understandably, this City Commission and city staff are very, very 
 reluctant to go down that road again. Thankfully, this City Commission 
 and city staff are very, very reluctant to go down that road again. Two 
 commissioners, however, Jimmy Weekley, who was on the earlier City 
 Commission that brought on the Duck Tours Waterloo, and Clayton Lopez, 
 voted against the franchise to Cityview. They dont want any more 
 motorized tour vehicles in Key West, because we already have too many of 
 them; they are adversely affecting our quality of life. Yep. And those 
 vehicles are all operated by HTA.
 
Ed Swift and many HTA employees also opposed the granting of City Views 
 franchise, giving the same reasons: we already have too much congestion 
 on our streets; we already have too many tour vehicles prowling around; 
 its adversely affecting our quality of life. Yep. And they are the 
 reason for it. Perhaps if they truly were concerned about the congestion 
 on our streets and our quality of life, they would disband HTA and get 
 its vehicles off our streets and improve our quality of life. Perhaps 
 also they would reimburse the city the nearly $9,000,000 it forked out 
 because it gave HTA a monopoly and protected it by running Duck Tours 
 out of business.
 
I mean, if they really love Key West, shouldnt Ed Swift, HTA and its 
 employees, all of whom made out handsomely in the past, squiring 
 tourists, mostly cruise ship tourists around town, thanks in no small 
 measure to the monopoly HTA enjoyed, make amends, instead of acting like 
 the city is doing them and the city wrong by allowing competition 
 against HTA? Maybe when HTAs contract comes up for renewal in six 
 years, the City Commission outlaws all tour vehicles in Key West, 
 including HTAs, because our streets are too congested and our quality 
 of life is being adversely affected. What does it benefit the city to 
 have tourists squired around town? Wouldnt it be better for the city 
 and its businesses if they were left on foot, to wander through the Old 
 Town Business District?

 The U.S. is considering debt relief to poor

 but the Dems would steal this opportunity to take $1.20 from the rich 
 and nothing from the middle class, then decide that the middle class 
 needs debt relief and take another $10,000 per year from the rich to 
 meet these goals. Yet somehow the Dems try to spin this as reducing 
 taxes.
 
In the same light the debt to China is only $593 per person. How about 
 they just forgive that?

 Speaker 
 Pelosi and President Obama have told the 
 American people on many occasions that the current administration and 
 this congress are the most ethical and transparent in American history. 
 President Obama promised us at least 8 times health care negotiations 
 and hearings would be televised on CSPAN.  

 Instead, we 
 have seen roughly 2000 page bills that come to the floor of the House 
 and Senate for a vote with sometimes as little as 48 hours for the 
 public and Congressional members to read them before passage.  

 Backroom deals 
 come to light only after the vote has been promised and funding or other 
 concessions have been made between Senators. A perfect example of this 
 is Sen. Mary Landrieu&apos;s yes vote after the&quot;Louisiana Purchase&quot;of not 
 $100 million but $300 million.  

 Senate 
 Majority Leader Harry Reid has not made the health care bill public 
 until after the CBO scores it.  

 Votes taken 
 under the cover of darkness in the middle of 
 the night that will tax us immediately but will have no 
 benefit to the very people they are supposed to help for years to come. 
 On and on it goes, President Obama has been far less that truthful with 
 his word, even if you voted for him and the&quot;Change you can believe in&quot;you should be hold him to what he promised.

 [ IKC 
 Founders ] I found this picture of the 2 brothers who were the 
 founders of the IKC. Of course back then they still went by the original 
 name The Inbred Kids Club . Cletus wanted to be the I Kill Cats Club as that was one 
 of their favorite pass times, but Jethro liked having the word kid in 
 the title as they both had an unhealthy attraction to young boys. It was 
 only recently that pressure from the community forced them to adopt the 
 iguana wording in the hopes it would obscure their true motives. They 
 are both quite happy with the recent recruitment drive although 14 year 
 olds are at the upper end of the age limit and they hope to be inducting 
 some pre-teens shortly. As far as the other adult members of the IKC, 
 Cletus and Jethro still rank as among the best educated of 
 the membership and without a doubt the best looking. 

 Stay tuned for an exclusive expose of the inner circle of 
 this mysterious group where we will hear of the strange initiation 
 rituals rumored to involve a pig and an effigy of Ned Beatty.

 jealous of my hot flashes. 
 [ SIN ] 
 Oh boy, do I feel safe now. The IKC and Lunatic Anonymous cults 
 membership drive was a success and now have 193 drunken rednecks and 
 their kids ready to hunt down, molest and kill defenseless Iguanas with 
 rifles, barbed arrows and spiked clubs. These murderous lizard lickers 
 don&apos;t care about the Iguana&apos;s human caused plight. I would bet that most 
 of the Iguanas were at one time the pets of these inebriated PBR 
 guzzlers. I would love to know which homeowners association hired this 
 group. Great scenario: 20 pickup trucks with tapped kegs and BBQ grills 
 strapped in the beds pull into the neighborhood; a rush of ball cap 
 mullet-headed, cut off sleeves tee shirted rednecks whooping and 
 hollering disembark the trucks armed to the teeth with whatever - start 
 shooting at anything that moves, including your cats, dogs, birds in the 
 canals and most likely collateral damage i.e. your car and house 
 windows. nothing like a little mayhem and chaos for your friends and 
 family&apos;s entertainment. 

 You won&apos;t have to worry about the iguanas eating your 
 plants and foliage. By the time this group is done relieving themselves; 
 there will be not any living vegetation left. As the leader of newly 
 found SIN, I will not tolerate this carnage. My group and my members are 
 passing the word about these cowards. We plan on rescuing the iguanas 
 before they can be harmed. And IKC be warned: We have paintball guns to 
 defend ourselves if necessary! They will all be loaded with yellow balls 
 and are locked on rapid fire.

 [Hes Back] Alcoholics Anonymous twelve steps on 
 how to walk away from Christ. Satan&apos;s 12 deceptive steps.

Mr. Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) and creator 
 of the twelve step program was heavily influenced by demons. Chapter 
 sixteen (p. 275f) of &apos;Pass It On&apos; The Story of Bill Wilson and how the 
 A.A. message reached the world records Mr. Wilson&apos;s on how he would 
 receive&quot;messages&quot;from&quot;discarnate&quot;spirits. Bill Wilson was clearly in 
 contact with saton and this is the man who created the deceptive twelve 
 step program. Make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the 
 care of God as we understood Him. (step #11. Emphasis added.) The last 
 part of this statement (&quot;as we understood Him&quot;) is enough to damn your 
 soul! God says, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on 
 your own understanding. (Proverbs 3:5). This is the exact opposite of&quot;God as we understood Him.&quot;All men, according to Romans 1:18-32, are 
 condemned before God, because they rely upon their own understanding 
 (Romans 1:21; Ephesians 4:18,&quot;having their understanding darkened&quot;), 
 and they create (in their own darkened minds) a god of their own making 
 (Romans 1:23). To encourage people to turn their&quot;lives over to the care 
 of God as we understood Him&quot;, is to encourage people to&quot;turn their 
 lives over to a god of their own making&quot;(i.e. according to their own 
 understanding). This promotes nothing more than spiritual death 
 (Revelation 22:15). In addition, these twelve steps are a deceitful 
 attack against the saving work of the Lord Jesus Christ (i.e. they are 
 against Christ, antichrist, 2 John 7; Colossians 2:8-10). The twelve 
 steps are (as Mr. Wilson used them) given as an answer (a way) in which 
 one can overcome sin (with Mr. Wilson&apos;s case, the sin of drunkenness). 
 Jesus Christ is the ONLY answer for sin. He is the only way (John 14:6). 
 There is only ONE&quot;step&quot;, and that is faith in the Savior (Ephesians 
 2:8/Matthew 1:21/John 8:36/Romans10:13)! The above exemplifies the&quot;twelve steps&quot;are what are used to&quot;become free from addictive, 
 compulsive&quot;behavior (i.e. sin). In other words, the twelve steps are 
 the savior! No doubt it is deceptive, because&quot;Biblical principles&quot;are 
 interwoven throughout; but if they weren&apos;t, few (if any) would be 
 deceived. One good question to ask would be,&quot;Where does Scripture talk 
 about any &apos;twelve steps&apos;&quot;? The answer? Nowhere! These twelve steps come 
 from Satan (via Bill Wilson), who is the master deceiver (Revelation 
 12:9). Remember, Satan used Scripture to tempt Christ (Matthew 4:6), and 
 Balaam spoke much truth (Numbers 23-24); but he was a false prophet (2 
 Peter 2:15-16/Numbers 22). In Matthew 7:13-14 Jesus warned, Enter by the 
 narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to 
 destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the 
 gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who 
 find it. Jesus likewise warned in Luke 13:24, Strive to enter through 
 the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, Will seek to enter and will not

 Dipping] With all these security breeches of late, it would seem 
 that somehow some really big money could be made if they required 
 full-body scanners in every airport in the nation. Well, guess who 
 already thought of that one? 

 Since the attempted bombing of a U.S. Airliner on 
 Christmas Day, former Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff has 
 given dozens of media interviews touting the need for the federal 
 government to buy more full-body scanners for airports. 

 What he has made little mention of is that the Chertoff 
 Group, his security consulting agency, includes a client, Rapiscan 
 Systems, that manufactures the machines. The relationship drew 
 attention after Chertoff disclosed it on a CNN program Wednesday, in 
 response to a question. 

 The machines would not have detected the package of powder explosives in the underwear 
 bombers tighty-whities, but the machines are being touted quite 
 strongly, as the answer to our safety needs. 

 Does anyone still doubt that we are owned lock, stock and 
 barrel by major corporations? There&apos;s a gold mine for many corporate 
 interests in every disaster. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/31/AR2009123102821.html

 [ U-2 
 Spy Plane ] What a story! I did not know the US trained Chinese 
 pilots to fly the U-2 in the 50&apos;s and sure didn&apos;t know one made an 
 emergency landing in Cortez CO!  Have patience with the slow start, 
 it&apos;s a story worth hearing. 

 Additional info from someone who lived there at the time:   I&apos;ve got something to add for everybody. I was in High School when it 
 happened. Word got around school about some strange airplane out at the 
 airport. During lunch break a bunch of us got into a car and headed out 
 to the airport to get a look. 

 We could see it about 700 yards from us. We were on the county road. The&quot;security fence&quot;in those days was a 3-strand barbed wire fence to 
 keep cattle out. We hopped out, went through the fence and started 
 walking toward the airplane. We noticed that there were 5 or 6 guys in 
 uniforms around it and it looked like they were carrying machine guns.  That got our attention but we kept walking. A very, very big guy 
 left the airplane and started our way. We were still 400 yards from the 
 airplane. The big guy yelled at us to&quot;STOP!&quot; We ignored that and kept 
 moving. He closed the distance to about 30 yards and again commanded, 
 hand out, palm toward us in an un-mistakable signal,&quot;I said stop!&quot;. We 
 kept on. He stopped, spread his stance and pulled out a 45. He leveled 
 it on us and said,&quot;Boys, you don&apos;t understand. This is serious.  If 
 you don&apos;t stop I will shoot.&quot; We believed him. He told us to 
 leave and we did.  Knowing what we know today we probably saved some of 
 our own lives and him a bunch of paperwork. I&apos;m pretty sure he&apos;d have 
 done what his orders were and not allow civilians near the &quot;black&quot;airplane.   www.hmhfp.info/SG_09E.html

 morning of Jan. 16. 

 The ninth

 sexual abuse in the Florida Keys by directing victims and abusers to 
 appropriate, effective programs and services. 

 Medals for

 [ From the Right ] Im guessing that it must be pretty 
 hard to be a liberal these days. The rhetoric of the campaign of 08 still 
 rings in my right ear. I remember so clearly the nonstop promises from 
 Candidate Obama to bring change to DC. Thats pretty heady stuff, especially 
 to me who then and now also yearns for change in DC. Mr. Obama actually 
 convinced millions that he would govern from the middle he promised to give 
 us a transparent government. He specifically promised his awestruck 
 supporters that he would air all the negotiations involved in Obama care. He told us that it was so important that we deserved to know. I know that 
 you will remember his multiple promises to broadcast it all in on C-Span. To 
 tell the truth, I hope that someone challenges these claims that he lied, 
 because listing each of his broken promises could make a very interesting 
 posting that would be lot of fun to write. Where is the Left Wing guy when 
 you need him? His promises were so seductive that its likely that they won 
 him plenty of votes. I know that I like the idea of open government. But 
 now Mr. Obama, the President of these United States has again been shown to 
 be an absolutely excellent liar. He now refuses to open the proceedings to 
 public scrutiny. One must wonder why he refuses to let you watch if the bill 
 is so good for America. Why isnt he proud of it? Can it be that hes afraid 
 that his union followers will finally learn that they will lose huge slices 
 of their care benefits under Obamacare? Just yesterday he O.K.d taxing 
 their Cadillac health plans. Or is he afraid that all Americans will be 
 really furious if they found out how much federal payola is going to key 
 Democrat legislators to buy their votes? Florida has a Sunshine Law, and 
 controversial bills still get passed. The record is replete with lies from 
 Mr. Obama. Can it be simple ego that prevents some of our left wing friends 
 from admitting that Mr. Obama has been an incredible disappointment to 
 them? His gravitas has been ripped away to the extent that he is now the 
 target of cutting satire by comedians. Even his suave demeanor is for 
 as much ridicule as was Mr. Bushs inelegant carriage.. Our wannabe Emperor 
 is not yet naked, but he is down to his fur lined jock strap and mittens. 
 Should I be ashamed to admit that Im delighted that he has repeatedly 
 pissed on the shoes of his left wing base? Nah! Theres no doubt that it&apos;s 
 getting harder and harder for them to keep blindly following their Pied 
 Piper. If I were a liberal Id be mortified, really angry at having been 
 shucked on like a city slicker seducing a buck toothed farm girl. Ill bet 
 that he and his have giggles and grins about it. 

 (Part II) The Washington Post is a reliable news 
 outlet. It is cautious with its reporting and they do a lot of fact 
 checking. As a non believer in&quot;Man Caused Global Warming&quot;, the follow piece 
 disturbed me. Its about an Arctic expedition done by Norwegians and their 
 report of their findings to the Commerce Department in Bergen Norway. It 
 says in part:
 
The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some 
 places the seals are finding the water is too hot. Reports from 
 fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in 
 climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. 
 Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met with as 
 far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters 
 showed the gulf stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been 
 replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at 
 many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.. Very few seals 
 and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of 
 herring and smelts, which have never before ventured so far north, are being 
 encountered in the old seal fishing grounds. 

 I must reluctantly agree that the report does strongly 
 support the notion of climate change. Ooops, sorry, I just noticed that the 
 report is dated November 1922. Havent we been told again and again that 
 arctic ice melt is a purely modern day problem? Dammit, it was nearly ice 
 free up there in 1922, then it the region cooled again and it all refroze. 
 Remember we dont have any satellite ice pictures before 1979. Remember that 
 Greenland was named Greenland because it was green when Eric the Red 
 discovered in 982 AD. He settled it, in the 1300&apos;s the climate changed, it 
 froze, they left. God only knows how many times the Arctic has frozen solid 
 then thawed, then frozen, etc. etc. Now its frozen again and it may or may 
 not be thawing again. Folks, the whole man-caused-global-warming gig is pure 
 unadulterated donkey dung.

 [ Gift Shop Review ] I have family in town this week 
 and took them to Little Palm Island for lunch. I go out there quite a 
 bit so I fully understand their policy on dining guests wandering the 
 island and I respect that privacy policy. As a lunch or dinner guest 
 you are allowed to go to the gift shop as I did with my mother and 
 sister.  

 We were waited on by the most obnoxious, pompous, 
 arrogant woman I have ever incurred. I wish I had gotten her name 
 because I&apos;d love to publicly name her on here. She had short grey hair, 
 was about 70 (I&apos;m guessing) and had a southern accent. She talked down 
 to us, told us that the gift shop usually caters to the more affluent 
 people who stay there rather than&quot;Lunch People&quot;and insulted my mother 
 who could probably buy Little Palm.  

 Someone needs to remind this woman that she folds shirts 
 for Little Palm Island and doesn&apos;t stay or dine there. My mother was 
 planning on buying a Little Palm sweat shirt for each of her grand 
 children--11 of them, but decided not to give that woman a dime. We 
 went down to Key West and got Sloppy Joe&apos;s shirts instead. I really 
 wish I had gotten her name because I surely plan on writing to Noble 
 House Resorts in Kirkland, WA to share my unpleasant experience with 
 them. I go out there to eat at least once a month sometimes more and 
 stay a weekend once a year. Maybe next time I will go to Sunset Key 
 where their customers are treated a little better. ~debbieplunket@gmail.com

 of the clergy who would speak out against evil. I think From The Right

 just sick whether you agree with his politics or not. 
 Charles 
 E. Bills, known as Capt. Chuck, passed peacefully at Fisherman&apos;s Hospital in Marathon, after a 
 courageous battle with cancer, on Monday, Jan. 5, 2009, at the age of 
 54. The love of his life and soul mate of 10 years, Lisa Meyer, was with 
 him. Chuck was born on April 13, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, to Charles E. 
 Bills Sr. (deceased) and Irene Bills Betze. Chuck&apos;s mother, Irene, and 
 his stepfather, Albert F. Betzel, reside on Little Torch Key, and 
 Diamond Bar, Calif. Chuck is survived by his sisters, Carol Tartagline 
 of Apple Valley, Calif., and Susan Bolduc of Phoenix, Ariz., and nephews 
 and a niece. 

 He was a devoted father to his two daughters, Naomi and Shelby, and 
 Lisa&apos;s daughter, Lauren, and grandson, Michael. 

 Capt. Chuck was a longtime resident of Little Torch Key. Many remember 
 him from his Looe Key Boat Rental business at the Summerland Chevron. He 
 spent many years at the Big Pine Flea Market selling knives until he and 
 Lisa opened Lost Cargo Trading Post on Big Pine Key three years ago. 
 Chuck lived his life with ease and enjoyed what he did. He loved 
 watching cartoons with his girls, making custom knives, visiting yard 
 sales and spending time on Picnic Island with his girls. In his quiet 
 way, he could always make us smile. He will be missed by so many. 

 Life is short. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s been a year. We miss you Capt. We 
 love you. ~Your island girls.

 notorious for doing. We all remember when Bush said,&quot;Bring &apos;em on&quot;and

 presently living many of the values Wright preached in favor for 30 yrs. 
 One of them was whether you can afford them or not you have a right to 
 own a house and be taken care of by the government. 

 Wright&apos;s 
 sermons are shaping America and our lives. Where do you think Obama&apos;s 
 visions to fundamentally transform the United States of America came 
 from? Where did his visions of spread the wealth around, redistribute 
 the wealth and amnesty is a right come from? From old Reverend 
 Wright&apos;s preaching. The church&apos;s website: About Us, Our Mission, Our

 adult members and 14 juniors. We know number 193 avid sportsman ready to 
 participate in the thrill of hunting and exterminating the invasive 
 iguanas. We demonstrated the new IKC41 high powered air rifle, with 
 laser scope, paid for with the recently approved Federal Grant. We are 
 expecting the full shipment of rifles in a few weeks and they will be 
 handed out to all qualified members. As these rifles were paid for by 
 the grant they will be yours to keep and enjoy for years to come. We 
 just recently signed a contract with a home owners association to help 
 rid their neighborhood of over 300 Iguanas. Rather than just dumping all 
 of the iguana carcasses in the canals, we have located a retired 
 taxidermist that will preserve and mount the Iguanas so they can be used 
 as a trophy or to be sold in our soon to be gift store located in the 
 Winn Dixie plaza. The gift shop will be carrying a full line of 
 products, from air rifles, pistols, sling shots, blow guns with darts, 
 ammo, cross bows, barbed arrows, spiked clubs, hunting and skinning 
 knives, iguana jerky, hot sauce, bird and turtle eggs, snake skin belts 
 and boots, rabbit fur slippers, Iguana claw back scratchers and various 
 other animal products. All of the animal products, except the Iguanas, 
 will be purchased on line and not killed locally so as not to disturb 
 the delicate balance of the local eco systems and native habitats. The 
 iguana cook books were a great hit at the cook off and we will be 
 ordering more when they are sold out. Hopefully the founder of the IKC 
 will be able to make quest appearances to do book signings. Thanks to 
 all the IKC sponsors for the great free food/beer and entertainment. 

 We are still 
 in need of sponsorship for the trophies in the junior male and female 
 divisions. We are currently working on a design for the IKC bumper 
 sticker to be proudly displayed on your vehicle. If you have a problem 
 with Iguanas on your property and would like to have them presently 
 removed, free of charge, please contact the IKC. At the next meeting of 
 the IKC we will be electing our new IKC officers and we are currently 
 looking for nominations for the positions of Grand Lizard and Imperial 
 Lizard.

 The effort was designed to save some left leaning CT readers the effort 
 of reading right wing opinion, and the pain of considering its merits. The truth is often painful. The pissed off poster was also correct in 
 noting that my postings are often contain insults. The insulting 
 comments are usually in response to remarks from the previous day. I 
 believe in God, but not in any religion. Therefore, usually I see no 
 value in turning the other cheek to an attacker. I urge the pissed off 
 poster to become the From the Left Guy. Its a fair guess that some 
 readers will have interest in a response to the posting which revealed 
 the left wing fraud of global warming and its evil progeny, Cap and 
 Trade. Silence will speak volumes. 

 (Part II) The content of Obamas speech yesterday was of mixed worth. On 
 the one hand he did the right thing in finally coming to the realization 
 that the near success of the Merry Christmas bomber was a massive 
 failure of his people who are charged with keeping us safe. On the other 
 hand he sounded very much more like a tyrant than a President. His 
 speech was chock full of bellicose anger and his repeated reference to 
 I wont stand for (you fill in the blank). Mr. Obama seemed to be of 
 the view that he was personally insulted. There was no mention of The 
 buck stops here. Frankly he sounded like a petulant Mussolini. He did 
 the right thing in promising accountability, from his underlings. Well 
 have to wait to see if he follows through. On the other hand he did not 
 accept anything resembling personal responsibility for the massive 
 failure of his administration to keep us safe. His speech absolutely 
 failed to recognize that we are at war, that we are faced with militant 
 fighters, not with simple criminals or extremists. Indeed, he did not 
 even mention jihadism. Extremists kill abortion doctors or burn SUV 
 dealerships. Our foes are soldiers in a world wide community who are 
 proud to be at war with the U.S. Its absurd for him to say We wont 
 rest until all who are responsible are brought to justice while at the 
 same moment he shields the jihadist from an interrogation that would 
 reveal the identity of those responsible. Its absurd to claim the 
 high moral ground while raining down death from Predator rockets on the 
 heads and homes of those in Afghanistan who were preparing these 
 attacks. Death from the air for those who prepare while the actual 
 executors of those plans are granted American Constitutional rights. 

 When will we hear of any Obama plan to change the behavior of Muslim 
 fundamentalist jihadists. There can be no safety until that happens .

 To Professor From the Right &apos;s defender. Do you believe that you 
 and everyone else who reads the CT (except From the Right, of course) 
 have a short attention span? Do you believe that you are not smart? Well, that is what From the Right stated in his last two postings. You 
 defended him by stating,&quot;he is respectful of those with different 
 opinions&quot;. Are you kidding? He is rude, insulting, sarcastic and very 
 closed minded. He puts people down constantly for not agreeing with his 
 positions. I would enjoy reading his postings if he didn&apos;t continually 
 begin them with insults and try to widen the divide between us. None of 
 the CT readers deserve to be insulted. Unless From the Right has 
 statistics to prove that the readers of the CT have shorter attention 
 spans than others, we have to assume that this is his belief.  

 And about that smart thing. The Gallup Poll, May 2009 stated that 52% of 
 college graduates are Democrat and 37% are Republicans. They also state 
 that the residents of the blue states are more educated than those of 
 the red states. Amanda 
 Simpson , a former test pilot for Raytheon, has 
 been named to the Bureau of Industry and Security as Senior Technical 
 Advisor by President Barack Obama. Simpson, who now identifies as a 
 female, was nominated by the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE). 
 In a news release from NCTE, Simpson expressed hope to&quot;soon be one of hundreds (of transgender presidential appointees). 

 Is there going to be a transgender quota now in the 
 Obama administration? Brother, this is the stuff that occupies our fruit 
 cake President. How about the economy, war and a sensible health care 
 policy/ Now we have to stuff the government with socialists, communists, 
 gays and transgenders. We have to give terrorists the right to remain 
 silent. We have to apologize to the world for spending billions to

 [ From the 
 Right ] The strange case of the Brothers Karim . To know the 
 Brothers Karim you must know their parents. Abduhl Karim, then a Yemeni 
 visiting student studying at U.C. Berkeley, met Naomi Nussbaum, the 
 daughter of Orthodox Jews, at Berkeley where she too was a student. At 
 Berkeley they fell in love. Naomi rejected her religion, and her name. 
 She took the Muslim religion and the Muslim name, Aisha. At Berkeley 
 they nurtured their hatred of America during their involvement with the 
 many campus activists groups. They honed and stoked their antipathy for 
 all things American. On Abduhls graduation, he returned to Yemen with 
 his bride Aisha, nee Naomi Nussbaum, who had rejected her native 
 country, her heritage, and her religion. Their union produced a set of 
 triplet boys, Abduhl, Achmed, and Arnold, (a sop to her father). The 
 Brothers were brought up as proper Shiite Muslims. They were schooled in 
 a series of Madrasah dīniyyah  and by Imams, their parents taught them the evils of the Great Satan. 
 The were faithful to their parents, to themselves, their religion, and 
 to Allah. On their 18 th birthday the Brothers swore an oath 
 to Allah and to each other to pursue Jihad. Their parents were very 
 proud. As a family, it was decided that Arnold, because of his 
 Americanized name, would travel to the home of the Great Satan to learn 
 his ways and to become a part of the &apos;Aalim Network. Some believe that 
 the Aalim network is populated with Muslim American supporters of 
 Jihadism. He enrolled in U.C, Berkeley. Arnold traveled the USA, 
 counseling with many Muslim Americans, visiting many mosques, and 
 learning from many Imams. Arnold learned American ways. Achmed and Abdul 
 continued their education in a series of training camps in Afghanistan 
 and Pakistan. They learned the art and science of insurrection, 
 terrorism, and internecine warfare. Their dedication to Jihad 
 flourished. At age 21 the Brothers reunited in Yemen to pursue their 
 training and dedication to Jihad. They decided to act. They decided that 
 Arnold would directly attack the Great Satan by destroying a packed U.S. 
 airliner with a bomb hidden on his body. Achmed would become a fighter 
 with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Abduhl would become a fighter with the 
 Taliban in Pakistan.. Arnold was introduced to the AQI network and 
 Abduhl and Achmed took up arms. Achmed was wounded and captured during 
 a firefight with Americans in Helmand province. Abduhl was captured by 
 the Brits while he was placing an IED near Punjab. Abduhl and Achmed 
 were interrogated by their respective captors. Each gave up priceless 
 intelligence which led to: the capture of 8 management level AQI, the 
 destruction of 7 AQI terrorist training camps, freeing 1 AQI hostage, 
 and 4 ambushes wherein 14 Taliban fighters were killed and 19 were 
 captured. Both are now in Gitmo pending the end of Muslim fundamentalist 
 terrorism. Arnold, with tech support from AQI, placed 60 grams of PETN 
 encapsulated in plastic in his rectum. The package was to be detonated 
 by yanking on a thin monofilament lanyard connected to the detonator. 
 The lanyard trailed 2 inches from his anus. He boarded a flight from 
 Paris to Miami. During the downwind leg of the approach to 9L at MIA, as 
 the plane crossed the beach, Arnold stunned his seatmate as he lept to 
 his feet repeatedly screaming Allahu Ackbar&quot;. He dropped his pants, 
 screeched&quot;Allahu Ackbar&quot;, and pulled his lanyard. On yanking the 
 lanyard, the package misfired and was yanked from his anus, along with 
 the contents of his lower bowel. All fell to the floor of the Delta 767. 
 Arnold only managed to utter Oh Shit in the nanosecond before his 
 seatmate, a 35 year old militant Zionist, broke several bones in Arnolds 
 face. On landing, Arnold was taken into custody by Federal officials who 
 followed the Obama protocol to the letter. Arnold was Mirandized, and he 
 refused to be interviewed. On hearing of Arnolds fealty to Muslim 
 fundamentalism, 39 members of the Aalim network praised Allah. Arnold 
 did not submit to interview. Arnold was convicted in civilian criminal 
 court and sentenced to life in prison. In prison he met yet another 
 Imam. He is now totally absorbed in pursuing advanced Muslim studies. He 
 is at peace with himself, and has become a fan of John and Kate plus 8 
 reruns. The militant Zionist was convicted in State Court of Aggravated 
 Battery, and his sentence was enhanced to 6 years because of his 
 utterance of hate speech against Muslims while he was pounding Arnold. 
 Mr. Obama reaffirmed his policy of trying terrorists in Civilian court, 
 and called the episode an isolated incident. 12 months later the same 
 AQI techs who had fitted Arnold, perfected Anus Bomb ver.2.1. A week 
 later at Brandenburg International Airport, Berlin, Arnolds younger 
 brother, Al, boarded an American Airlines flight to Chicago.  How 
 strange.

Here&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eves blue moon from the middle Keys. 
 [ IKC 
 are cat killers] IKC fictitious.  Unfortunately, I have 
 known of people on Big Pine Key who put cats in plastic bags and 
 drown them, people who put antifreeze in food to poison animals, 
 people who shoot birds and animals with BB guns and other assorted 
 devices, people who take delight in hitting animals with their cars, 
 and the infamous four who killed the Blue Hole alligator. How in 
 the world can you really expect me to think the IKC is fictitious? I suggest you all put your combined energy into something positive, 
 including positive messages for this forum. 
 [ From 
 the Left? ] I don&apos;t have a problem with&quot;From the Right&quot;postings. After all, The Coconut Telegraph is an opinion page. The 
 From the Right guy presents his opinions in a manner that is well 
 thought out and respectful of those with different opinions. Many 
 times, he even relates how abstract political ideas might impact 
 Piners. Although I don&apos;t always agree with his opinions, I respect 
 his presentation in this forum. 

 I do 
 believe that some posters should be restricted, if not banned, from 
 the Coconut Telegraph, but the From the Right guy does not fall into 
 this category. Hate mongers like Sal spew attacks without facts to 
 back up his wild charges and no back story to explain his agenda. It 
 seems to be more score-settling than opinion. Likewise, lunatics 
 like Sloan who rambles on about a dream they had last night also 
 push the envelope of the definition of opinion. 

 In fact, 
 what we need is a&quot;From the Left&quot;daily posting. Those that snipe 
 at the From the Right guy often do so in a short, angry posting 
 without presenting a credible counter-point. These random knee-jerk 
 reactions by the left only make the left appear reactionary and make 
 the From the Right guy look more well, right. Is there anyone out 
 there who can present a thoughtful, respectful From the Left 
 counterpoint without degenerating into a name-calling reactionary?

 [ Problem fixer ] Please splain to this old not-so-smart white guy why 
 a little thinking out of the box wont do better than the same old 
 BS. I am sure some folks out there know why this is a bad think so 
 please share that with me. If not pass this on to the White House. I 
 did. 

 Dear Mr. President, Please find below my suggestion 
 for fixing America&apos;s economy. Instead of giving billions of dollars 
 to companies that will squander the money on lavish parties and 
 unearned bonuses, use the following plan. You can call it the 
 Patriotic Retirement Plan: There are about 40 million people over 50 
 in the work force. Pay them $1 million each severance for early 
 retirement with the following stipulations: 

 1) They must retire. Forty million job openings 
 -unemployment fixed.
2) They must buy a new American car. Forty million cars ordered- 
 auto industry fixed.
3) They must either buy a house or pay off their mortgage-housing 
 crisis fixed.

It can&apos;t get any easier than that. If more money is needed, have all 
 members of Congress and their constituents pay their taxes. If you 
 think this would work, do it. If not, please disregard it then shoot 
 yourself--one job opening! 
 This Obama bashing is getting pretty silly. I&apos;ve never seen 
 anything like it. The man can&apos;t sneeze without someone criticizing 
 him. Was the tissue he used made in the USA? Did he buy it or did 
 the tax payers pay for it? Did he use the correct method for wiping 
 his nose so that he isn&apos;t spreading his germs to anyone else? Was 
 the poster yesterday joking when he questioned the swing set that 
 the President bought for his daughters?  

 It is certainly acceptable to question and disagree 
 with our President&apos;s policies, but this stuff is nuts.  

 The&quot;Rainbow Castle&quot;swing set on the white House 
 lawn was made in the USA and cost $3,500. Joanie Barrus, Rainbow&apos;s 
 Illinois distributor, told the Associated Press and the Chicago 
 Tribune that the Obamas paid for it themselves. The swing set was 
 not the first to be put up on the White House lawn. Caroline 
 Kennedy also had one, but so what? Who cares? It is petty, 
 uninformed and just plain mean. 

 Stupid people talk about the President&apos;s birth 
 certificate, swing set, flag pin, golf game, dog, middle name, etc. 
 because they aren&apos;t smart enough to talk about his politics and the 
 issues that really matter.  I don&apos;t care what our President eats, 
 where he chooses to vacation, what kind of dog he has, what books he 
 reads, what church he attends or what music he listens to. It&apos;s a 
 free country...remember? I do care about how he is doing his 
 job--period.

 advocate for immigrant and  civil rights  has 
 started using  text messages  to warn 
 residents about crime sweeps by a high-profile  Arizona  sheriff. 
 Lydia Guzman, director of the nonprofit immigrant  advocacy 
 group  Respect/Respeto, is the trunk of a sophisticated 
 texting tree designed to alert thousands of people within minutes to 
 the details of the sweeps, which critics contend are an excuse to 
 round up illegal immigrants. 

 
Guzman said the messages are part of an effort to protect Latinos 
 and others from becoming victims of  racial 
 profiling  by sheriff&apos;s deputies.  Deputies  have 
 been accused of stopping Hispanics, including citizens and legal 
 immigrants, for  minor traffic violations  to 
 check their immigration status. If this is happening in Arizona then 
 it will happen in the Keys (if it is not already). 

 
What I wish is that they would check immigration status and work

 [ It&apos;s 
 Only A Par Three ] 
 Forget pitch and putt, this tee-off point on top of a 1,410 ft. 
 mountain in South Africa is the hardest golf shot in the world, and 
 more than $1 million awaits the player who can score a hole in one. 
 Players must take a helicopter to the top to play the longest and 
 highest par three on the planet. Taking the shot also requires 
 courage. A player needs to teeter terrifyingly close to the edge of 
 the mammoth hillside. Indeed, the Extreme 19th Hole is so high the 
 ball takes almost 30 seconds to reach the ground. 

 Channel Nine cricket commentator Mark Nicholas 
 recently joined an elite list to have the shot in just three swings.&quot;It was awesome, riveting and phenomenal,&quot;he said,&quot;it&apos;s like the 
 end of the world when you get up there and it&apos;s an awful lot of fun. 
 It&apos;s such an adrenaline rush taking the helicopter up and then 
 rushing back down.&quot;The hole is based at the Legends Golf and Safari 
 Resort, within the Entabeni Safari Conservancy in South Africa&apos;s 
 Northeastern Limpopo Province. The other 18 holes were designed by 
 world golfing legends including Trevor Immelman, Sergio Garcia, 
 Padraig Harrington and Australia&apos;s Robert Allenby. A round of golf - 
 including a buggy and lunch - will set you back $70. The Extreme 
 19th cost is $1060 per four ball, that includes helicopter ride, 
 souvenir cap, glove, and a DVD of you playing the hole. So far, no 
 one has even come close to pocketing the million dollar prize, but 
 Harrington became the first golfer to conquer the hole within par. 

 Harrington said,&quot;This is the type of innovation and 
 excitement we need to get more people playing golf. There aren&apos;t 
 many new innovative ways to play the game, but this is certainly one 
 of the best. I think this hole is awesome. I love the whole 
 experience, the helicopter, the views, the drama and having the 
 green the shape of Africa. And now I&apos;ve got bragging rights over all 
 the other professionals who have played this hole and not managed to 
 make a three. I love everything about it.&quot;

 pick up my free hat, tee shirt and extra ammo. I also received a 
 free copy of the Iguanas Big Book cooking guide. Also they are going 
 to have me get a sponsor so she can show me the correct and humane 
 way to shoot iguanas. True they really dont have a clubhouse; they 
 use a vacant back room at one of the local churches to conduct their

 take-off. The wings are so long that they need temporary 
 support until lift-off. What is not shown is at landing the

 very far.

 SNL 
 skit slams President Obama on debt, 
 bailout, health care reform, and cash for clunkers. http://www.examiner.com/x-5738-Political-Buzz-Examiner~y2009m11d22-Video--SNL-skit-slams-President-Obama-on-debt-bailout-health-care-reform-and-cash-for-clunkers 
 I 
 personally can&apos;t wait for the enactment of&quot;cap and trade&quot;. Maybe we 
 can get a cap on  From the Reich&apos;s polluting dogmatic 
 posts. Groan. 
 In Somalia , which is without a central government to speak of 
 and where very little functions beyond an Islamic resistance and 
 individual warlords&apos; fiefdoms, a robust&quot;stock market&quot;has emerged 
 in the city of Haradheere for&quot;investors&quot;in the seagoing pirate&quot;industry,&quot;to raise money and supplies for kidnappers in exchange 
 for a share of the bounty once a ransom is paid. According to a 
 December Reuters dispatch, 72&quot;companies&quot;are listed on the 
 exchange, enabling&quot;venture capital&quot;to fund greater piracy traffic 
 and more sophisticated looting. There even seems to be a financial&quot;bubble&quot;at work, in that since the&quot;exchange&quot;opened, pirates&apos; 
 ransoms have doubled to about $4 million per ship. 

 I see a new growth industry for the Keys. Think of 
 all the ships in the Florida straights. Oh, never mind, that would 
 require people to get off their bar stools and stop bickering.

[ IKC ] I am a

 extradition to Michigan. 
 [ Grouper ban ] Let me explain. I take grouper 
 or lobster whenever I want. I don&apos;t take undersize of either. I 
 could care less about mini-season. I only eat lobster 2-3 times a 
 year.

 [ From the Right guy ] President Obama was 
 responsible for the soldier that killed the other soldiers? He was a 
 soldier during Bush time in office why didnt the writer mention 
 that? You, my friend, using their deaths as a way to politicize your 
 political gain makes you lower then dirt. I will never read or 
 respond to your ignorant rants again. Im done with you. The 1/4 
 truth man to me has just become empty space. Thats as low as an 
 American can go--politicizing American troops deaths. A pox on your 
 ugly soul! 

 If you blame Obama for the attacks betweens soldiers 
 you have to blame bush for 9/11. Fair and balanced

 [ Obama ] 
 We&apos;ve figured him out--By Ben Stein Why is President Barack Obama in 
 such a hurry to get his socialized medicine bill passed? Because he 
 and his cunning circle realize some basic truths: The American 
 people in their unimaginable kindness and trust voted for a pig in a 
 poke in 2008. They wanted so much to believe Barack Obama was 
 somehow better and different from other ultra-leftists that they 
 simply took him on faith. They ignored his anti-white writings in 
 his books. They ignored his quiet acceptance of hysterical 
 anti-American diatribes by his minister, Jeremiah Wright. They 
 ignored his refusal to explain years at a time of his life as a 
 student. They ignored his ultra-left record as a&quot;community 
 organizer,&quot;Illinois state legislator, and Senator. The American 
 people ignored his total zero of an academic record as a student and 
 teacher, his complete lack of scholarship when he was being touted 
 as a scholar. Now, the American people are starting to wake up to 
 the truth. Barack Obama is a super likeable super leftist, not a fan 
 of this country, way, way too cozy with the terrorist leaders in the 
 Middle East, way beyond na�vet�, all the way into active 
 destruction of our interests and our allies and our future. The 
 American people have already awakened to the truth that the stimulus 
 bill -- a great idea in theory -- was really an immense bribe to 
 Democrat interest groups, and in no way an effort to help all 
 Americans. Now, Americans are waking up to the truth that ObamaCare 
 basically means that every time you are sick or injured, you will 
 have a clerk from the Department of Motor Vehicles telling your 
 doctor what he can and cannot do. The American people already know 
 that Mr. Obama&apos;s plan to lower health costs while expanding coverage 
 and bureaucracy is a myth, a promise of something that never was and 
 never will be -- a bureaucracy lowering costs in a free society. 
 Either the costs go up or the free society goes away. These are 
 perilous times. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, our Secretary of State, has 
 given Iran the go-ahead to have nuclear weapons, an unqualified 
 betrayal of the nation. Now, we face a devastating loss of freedom 
 at home in health care. It will be joined by controls on our lives 
 to&quot;protect us&quot;from global warming, itself largely a fraud if 
 believed to be caused by man. Mr. Obama knows Americans are getting 
 wise and will stop him if he delays at all in taking away our 
 freedoms. There is his urgency and our opportunity. Once freedom is 
 lost, America is lost. Wake up, beloved America. 
 Long live the Queen!  
 
 [ Global Warming ] There are a lot more than a 
 handful of scientists refuting global warming. Bubba, open your mind 
 a little and quit watching MSNBC. There is an incredible amount of 
 money that has been given to researchers who support global warming. 
 Do you think they are going to work at disproving it (hide the 
 decline or stop peer review)? I think not. 
 


We are born wet, naked and hungry. Then 
 things get worse. 
 [ Congress ] I have come to a conclusion that 
 one useless man is a shame, two is a law firm and three or more is a 
 congress. ~John Adams 
 [ I 
 cant find my way home ] I dont suppose Ill ever get out of my 
 thoughts Robert Heinleins book,  Stranger In a Strange Land , 
 about a human kid, born and raised on Mars, trained by 
 indigenous Martians who were nothing like humans. Then, when the 
 humans were being expelled from Mars, the boy, not a young man, was 
 sent back to Earth with the Martians inside of him, spying on Earth, 
 to make up their minds whether or not to blow it up, like they had 
 once had blown up the planet between Mars and Jupiter, after the 
 beings on that world became a threat to Martians. They blew that 
 planet up with some sort of force generated from their collective 
 minds; thus was the Asteroid Belt born.
 
As for the human kid the Martians sent back to Earth, well, he was a 
 bit different. He started gathering a following. He was viewed like 
 a Jesus. He was killed like Jesus. No sweat for me there. I dont 
 have a following. I am a professional repellant, have an unlimited 
 supply of skunk oil. Nobody will write any books about me after Im 
 gone. No desire. And no need I already wrote them. They might last 
 hundreds of years; anyone can access it, copy it, save it. 
 [ Obama ] 
 Whats up with Coconut Telegraph posters who bitch at people for 
 calling out Obama. The Obama supporters write that he is only doing 
 the same stuff that Clinton and Bush and Cheney did, so he shouldnt 
 be hollered at. Hey! I thought they liked him because they think 
 that hes better than the other guys and was going to change all 
 that. 
 
 [ From the Right ] A word of caution to CT&apos;s 
 short-attention-span readers, what follows will require thought. Mr. Obama 
 tells us that man caused global warming is a catastrophe under construction, 
 therefore he must intervene by passing Cap and Trade. He says he believes it 
 because he says it is settled science. The Father of our nation, George 
 Washington, was bedridden with a rapid onset illness. The best scientists of 
 the day were positive it was an illness called Quinsy, the best physicians 
 of the day treated him with the settled science treatment of the day: 
 bleeding. They cut his neck, he bled, he died.  George Washington died 
 while under the knife of settled science. One of the greatest scientists 
 of all time, Thomas A. Edison, said it was settled science that the world 
 would electrify by using DC current. The world was electrified by the use 
 of AC current. Early in the last century, it was settled science that 
 Zepplins or airships would be the future of human and commercial 
 transportation. In the 1970s it was settled science for many scientists 
 that our earth was in a cooling trend that could cause a new ice age. It 
 seems like just yesterday that we were flooded with the settled science 
 threat that global warming was on a sure course to smother us with more 
 frequent and more intense hurricanes. Now that hurricanes have substantially 
 diminished in number, the mantra is changing to global warming is likely 
 to diminish the number and power of hurricanes. Can it be settled science 
 when global warming causes more hurricanes that are more powerful at the 
 same time that it is causing fewer hurricanes? The core argument in support 
 of the theory of global warming is that us nasty humans have emitted so 
 much co2 into the atmosphere that it is causing a greenhouse effect. They 
 claim this theoretical greenhouse effect is leading to an increase in global 
 temps. On 12/31/09 Science Daily revealed brand new research that 
 shows that most of the c02 emitted by human activity does not remain in the 
 atmosphere, but is instead absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial 
 ecosystems. This research says that only about 45 percent of emitted carbon 
 dioxide stays in the atmosphere. It reports that the airborne fraction of 
 carbon dioxide has not increased either during the past 150 years or during 
 the most recent five decades. So, no atmosphere packed with co2, means no 
 greenhouse effect. No greenhouse effect means no increase in temps caused by 
 c02. One set of scientist claim that there has been no increase in global 
 temps since 1998. For several years weve been hammered with reports that 
 the Arctic sea ice is going the way of ice in scotch in August at Robs. But, 
 just this last December 7 th , 2009, The National Snow and Ice Data 
 Center reported that In general, the Arctic sea ice edge is now at or 
 slightly beyond its average (30 year) location. Maybe all of this is the 
 reason that the they&apos;ve now dumped the term&quot;Man Caused Global Warming&quot;now 
 they call it&quot;Man Caused Climate Change.&quot; Literally thousand of respected 
 scientist are part of the hue and cry that the theory of man caused global 
 warming is bad science not to be believed. Now brewing is a major scandal 
 that reveals that 2 of the lead scientist who promote global warming have 
 engaged in smear campaigns against other scientists that disagree. They 
 coined the pejorative term deniers. These 2 have left a paper trail of 
 e-mails that illuminate the dirty politics of science, and most damning of 
 all, they claim that they have lost the raw data on which they base their 
 theory. I guess Mr. Obama&apos;s dog must have eaten it. Whether or not there 
 is global warming, Cap and Trade is poison. I dont know about you, but this 
 morning Id welcome a little global warming on my 54 degree porch. Its my 
 settled science that its just too damned cold outside. ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091230184221.htm )

 Computing sure is getting to be 
 more fun with its beyond-belief technology and software. Todays machines 
 and operating systems (Microsoft, Mac, and Linux) are slick and cool. 
 Finally high definition video is available and todays video cards make it 
 flow like melted butter. Add to that, lightening fast DSL and broadband 
 internet and network connections and the worlds the limit. Theyre making 
 these things really fun to use. 

 Im sorry everyone else cant experience state of the art 
 computing with their outdated setups. I shudder to think of those 
 unfortunate people who are still using a dial-up internet connections and 
 AOL. 
 [ Christmas 
 in the Keys - it&apos;s hard to find the mood] Perhaps this can be a mood 
 breaker. The first three pictures of this movie are of a family member&apos;s 
 house in upper NY State a couple of years ago, the others grabbed online. I 
 made this movie for them and sent it. Guess who was on the phone within 
 days, asking&quot;Please let us come down and stay a week, please?&quot;Two things 
 are perfectly clear. The Keys are warm and winter up north really sucks big 
 time! 

 The best thing we ever did was bolt that area 21 years ago 
 and drive south as fast as we could until the road ran out. We haven&apos;t 
 missed it one bit. Cleaning up after Georges and the other big and small 
 blows has been a picnic compared to winter snows, ice and freezing cold 
 temperatures, winter after winter after winter. Our house of 20 years has 
 been paid off and life is good. No matter how we&apos;re labeled as residents 
 here, we are, and have been, home since we first shut the vehicle off 21 
 years ago to walk the sands of Smathers Beach bare footed. God Bless the 
 Keys! Video 
 [ Jim Scholl ] 
 I just read that the salary of the Governor of Florida is $132K and the Key 
 West City Manager makes $180K. Whats wrong with this picture?

 [ Another snowbird story ] 
 Isnt it arrogant when a snowbird, whose only here for a few months, yells 
 at you to slow down in the canal? So you look and youre not even making a 
 wake! 
 Bad 
 Solution] Usually when a young couple has marriage 
 problems their solution it to have a baby, thinking that will bring them 
 together. It always works the other way--divorce in a year or so. 
 [ You say tomato, I say ... ] It is always amazing to 
 read posts in the CT. No where else do the people have such different views 
 of a subject. The introverted notions of right and wrong, republican and 
 democrat, true or false, real or factious, are totally irrelevant to 
 reality. The horror is that these people vote and believe their vote matters 
 to the real world out side of their closet door! The animations are good, 
 though. 
That little deer on the couch with the beagle has letters shaved into 
 his head. Did that happen before or after he snuck through the doggie door? 
 Some days the animations and pictures are so damn 
 funny or right on and other times they arent. I go here partly because of 
 them. I dont know any other column that has such graphics. 
 


[ What is a Browser ] An operating system (OS) like Windows, Mac and

 [ Chinese 
 Drywall Causing Illness ] Attorneys filed a 
 class action lawsuit in New Orleans federal court on December 10 against 
 Chinese drywall manufacturers. More than 2,000 homeowners are enrolled in 
 the suit as plaintiffs - at their head, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean 
 Peyton, whose Mandeville home was built with Chinese drywall. 

 Peyton&apos;s high profile in New Orleans and nationally is only one reason for 
 selecting him as lead plaintiff. His particular case also happens to be 
 unusually well documented, the Times-Picayune reports:&quot;With more resources 
 to get to the root of the problem than many other people who have problem 
 drywall in their homes, Payton and his family moved out of their house, then 
 systematically took it apart. They took photos of the evidence along the 
 way, then stored the damaged components in a warehouse, where KPT, the 
 manufacturer, was able to inspect it.

 Dont you people get it? The IKC is a fictitious club. That means it does 
 not exist. Its just to annoy all you cat ladys out there. There is no 
 clubhouse, there are no awards, there is no 14 year old killer. We made it 
 up.

None of us participating in this hoax enjoy killing, we kill iguanas to stop 
 them from eating our flowers and plants and to rid the Keys of another 
 exotic pest. Get a life or at least a sense of humor. 

 Long live the IKC! 
 [ &apos;Tis the Season ] 
 There are way to many people in the Key&apos;s this weekend. 
 

[ The pigeon and the bagel ] This is really a great animated six minute 
 movie. http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=jEjUAnPc2VA 
 [ Red States -- Blue States ] The writer forgot to add 
 that most in the red states believe the bible when it says that the earth 
 and everything else was created in 6 days. 

 I watched yesterday as a scientist tried to explain the 15 
 billion years that real science says it took to create the Earth from the 
 big bang all the way to pizza pies. He compared it to an elastic band that 
 was stretched from the big bang to today. He then said that if you divided 
 15 billion by 1 million or billion (it all sounded like bs), youd get .015 
 or something and that would explain the 6 days. His interviewer was 
 dumbfounded. 
 I suspect hes one 
 of the handful scientists that deny global warming. 
 [ Swing 
 Set too Expensive ] Obama and his big change have ended a year. So far 
 all I&apos;ve seen changed is we now have troops in two countries fighting to 
 protect people who want to blow us up and there is a swing set at the White 
 House that we, the tax payers bought. Can we pass on his change so I can 
 keep my dollars? 
 Washington DC has the highest per capita incidence of AIDS in the US. 
 
[ Home Improvement] Please, kindly do just one thing to make your 
 property a little nicer this year even if it is to wash your fence. If 
 everyone does one thing it will make a difference. 
 [ Repression ] Another reason Muslims kill us is because 
 they say we repress them. Its the other way around. They are trying to 
 repress us with fear. 
 
[ Solstices ] Can someone please tell me the sunrise and sunset times 
 for the winter solstices in 2009. And if you get the right webpage how about 
 those times for the summer solstice too? I havent had much luck searching, 
 but Im not that much of a researcher. 
 [ Mac Store in Key West has free classes ] The computer 
 club in Big Pine has free classes too and its closer. Bulletin Board 
 [ Grouper 
 Ban ] The guy who is still going to catch grouper during the ban is like 
 we were when they first imposed lobster regulations in the 1970s. My friends 
 and I would still go out and take about a hundred lobsterslong and 
 shortsat a time, thinking we were somehow excluded from contributing to 
 their depletion. Then there were no more. We had to go elsewhere and deeper. 
 One of my favorite stores, The Dollar Tree store, is 
 coming to Key West next door to Office Max. I watched them put the sign up 
 on Thursday.  The inside of the store is empty though. They have a lot of 
 work to do before its ready to open.   I hope they have a fast working 
 crew.     
 Republican 
 protesters chanting gibberish and burning an 
 effigy of U.S. President Barack Obama in the Winn-Dixie parking lot. (See 
 how changing a few words can change anything to your point of view.) 
 The resent 
 requests for new memberships to the Iguana Killers Club have been 
 overwhelming. The IKC does not have its web site up and running so they have 
 partnered with Road Kill Connoisseur, RKC, to sign up through their web page 
 3 new pages have been added to the site dedicated to the IKC. You can fill 
 out your free membership application online. Please allow 2 weeks for 
 delivery. You will be able submit and view your favorite iguana hunting 
 photos to the site which will be added to the new photos page. Please, only 
 submit photos in good taste of stalking, cooking, hunting, skinning, eating 
 and shooting Iguanas. When submitting your photos please indicate if you are 
 a current member in good standing and the number of kills you have 
 documented. There will be a photo contest and the winner will be awarded 2 
 free passes to the National Key Deer Refuge. This is a great location for a 
 hunter to be one with nature and to appreciate the wonders of the Florida 
 Keys. Did you know that in the Florida Keys, where iguana meat is 
 frequently consumed, iguanas are referred to as&quot;mangrove chicken&quot;or&quot;chicken of the trees.&quot; 
 [ Mac 
 computers--better graphics ] That is an urban legend from the 80s and 
 90s perpetuated by Mac users to justify their overpriced machine. Heres 
 the basis for the legend: Years ago Adobe Photoshop would only work on Macs 
 (Photoshop is the premier graphics software all industries use). When Mac 
 users and people in the advertising and print industries cite Macs better 
 graphics they are referring to the old days when it was true. That was 
 decades ago. Ive queried many Mac users about the legend that graphics are 
 better on a Mac and no one has ever been able to demonstrate it as fact. 
 They just say that every graphics person uses a Mac. 

 Im 
 not against Macs at all; Ive used them and like the Snow Leopard operating 
 system, it is very cool. I just cant find anything they do better than a 
 Windows 7 machine that justifies their costing twice as much as a Windows 
 machine. For the price of a Mac laptop I can buy a Windows 7 laptop and a Windows 7 PC. Two for the price of one Mac! 
 


[ Airport Security ] It now looks like there will be full body scanners 
 at all airports. These scanners will allow TSA employees to see underneath 
 your clothes to your privates. There will probably be a rush of perverts to 
 get jobs with TSA. 
 [ From the Right ] Everybody has heard of Cap and Trade. 
 If youre liberal youre probably hot for it, if youre conservative (or 
 smart) youre the idea really chills you. Cap and Trade legislation is the 
 darling idea of the Global Warming fundamentalists. Forget for the moment 
 about whether or not the phenomena of man caused global warming even exists; 
 lets just think about how Cap and Trade will operate. Lets say that you 
 run a sports bar on Big Pine Key. A brand new federal bureaucracy will 
 decide how much carbon your business should be emitting, that value will be 
 your Cap. Then the same spanking new bureaucracy will decide how much 
 carbon you actually emit. If you emit less than the Cap that they have 
 assigned you, you are golden. The difference between what carbon you 
 actually use and your quota will be your carbon credit. The carbon 
 credits have cash value, you can trade in them, you can buy and sell them. 
 If you emit more carbon than your quota, and you probably will, then you 
 will have to purchase or Trade for additional carbon credits from someone 
 else. Or you will have to somehow reduce your output of carbon or pay huge 
 fines. You might have to buy new equipment or completely change your 
 business model. Or, youll pay huge penalties. All the options suck and 
 will cost serious dollars. If you emit less than your quota, you can sell or 
 trade your excess carbon credits. What that really means is that it will be 
 O.K. to pollute as long as you are willing or able to pay for the privilege. 
 Thank our Democrat friends for this&quot;The Rich Get Richer&quot;scheme.. The 
 buying and selling of carbon credits will be through brokers (like Al 
 Gore) who will take a dandy profit from each transaction. Its important to 
 remember that whole purpose of this exercise is to reduce carbon emissions, 
 so you can be sure that carbon quota set by the gov will be a hell of a lot 
 less than your current carbon emissions. If Cap and Trade passes, our BPK 
 sports bar will have to pay a lot more for electricity, a lot more for every 
 single item that they purchase for resale and every item of new 
 equipment (remember all manufacturers and vendors are in the same boat). My 
 Deer friends, those additional costs will be passed on to the customers. 
 That bes you and me. The cost of beer, booze, pretzels, Rob Roys, wings, 
 and everything else that our BPK sports bar sells or dispenses will go 
 through the roof. A study by MIT discloses that the proposed carbon Cap and 
 Trade scheme would cost the average American household $3,9000 every year to 
 begin with. Well think about whether or not man caused global warming 
 really is settled science later. 

 (Part II) 
 Yesterday someone acidly lectured and told us that he must have missed any 
 episodes of blood being shed on American soil at the hands of Muslim 
 Fundamentalists since 9/11/01. Folks, in all honesty Ive tried to think of 
 an amusing smart assed comment to make about any human who could be that 
 dense; but I just cant. I will simply respectfully remind that poster that 
 in early November of 09 a Muslim fundamentalist terrorist named Nidal Malik 
 Hasan, in an act of Jihad, shot and killed 13 Americans and wounded an 
 additional 32 Americans with gunfire at Ft. Hood. Absent great shooting by 
 two courageous cops, Hasan would have killed and wounded many more. Hasan, 
 an Army Major, is a newbie home grown Muslim fundamentalist. He chose to be 
 a terrorist while a part of those who are sworn to protect us. Becuase of 
 political correctness his plot went undeterred. Prior to the massacre, 
 Hassan was in repeated contact with his spiritual advisor of choice, Anwar 
 al Awlaki. Awlaki is a passionate advocate of Jihadism, which is a polite 
 term for terrorism. That same Awlaki, was spiritual advisor and a mentor of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted yet another act of Jihad terrorism in the skies above Detroit on 
 12/25/09. On that day, God, not the Obama administration, saved hundreds of 
 lives. Contrary to Mr. Obamas 3 day late, political, cover his ass, 
 attestations, 12/25/09 was not an isolated incident of terrorism. Its 
 worth mentioning that since 09/11/01 until the Fort Hood massacre, 29 
 terrorist plots against US soil have been discovered and thwarted. The only 
 two have been successful have happened since Mr. Obama was innaugarated. Is 
 that 29 isolated incidents? By the way, the acidic poster was flat wrong 
 in saying that Mr. Obamas critics disgrace him. Only Mr. Obama has the 
 power to disgrace Mr. Obama, only he has that power. He is wielding that 
 power with extraordinary skill and fervor.

 they recieved warnings of an attack.I mean they have to be as 
 responsible as Obama holding the same positions dont they? And I agree we didnt have any terror attacks on American soil 
 for the remainder of Bushs term in office. But then one could say we didnt have any attacks on America for 7 1/2 years after the first attempt on the trade center occured 
 in the Clinton administration.Kudoes to you too President 
 Clinton. I wonder why the terorist waited until we were almost 25% into 
 the republican presidency before they attacked. Maybe they realized Clinton caught the attackers, tried the 
 attacks HERE IN AMERICA by the way and convicted them so we can 
 say they had their say. Wheres Bushs Osama? Theres not one false fact in this post so go ahead spin it into

 AT&amp;T 
 is ending its sponsorship deal with Tiger Woods.They tried to tell him by 
 phone, but there wasn&apos;t any coverage I saw the perfect response to rude behavior 
 on Dec. 30th while paying my property taxes. I arrived and was the 
 first one in front of the office on Big Pine. Another man showed up 
 within a couple of minutes. A third person showed up and stood between 
 me and the door. Numerous others showed up and formed a line. Another 
 man showed up and stood with the woman that got in front of me. (Don&apos;t 
 know if this is relevant but neither one of them spoke english.) I was 
 a bit miffed about them going to the front of the line but kept my mouth 
 shut expecting them to yeild to the people that were there first then 
 fall in line. When the door was opened the man went right to the sign 
 in log and signed in. I went next and everyone else signed in the 
 proper order in which they arrived. After everyone was signed in and 
 seated the attendant picked up the roster and jokingly said&quot;alright who 
 is trying to confuse me&quot;, you see the third man in line put the number 
 one in front of my name, #2 next to his name and #3 next to the man that 
 cut in line. In response to the attendants remark the man that wrote 
 the numbers on the log stated that was the order in which we arrived. When the attendant called my name first and his name second the man that 
 cut in line was clearly pissed and started saying something in spanish 
 and tried staring me down. I turned and asked him if he had a problem 
 with me and he again said something in spanish. The man that did the 
 deed looked over at me with a nod and a smile. I could not help thinking 
 what a great response he had to rude people without ever opening his 
 mouth. In addition to all of this, when it was their time to be waited 
 on the attendant could not understand spanish and told them they must 
 come back with an interpreter.  I had a smile on my face the rest of the 
 day.  My New Years Resolution was to follow the example of the man that 
 put these rude people in their proper place. I may make a lot of 
 enemies this year by speaking out against those who blatently break the 
 rules. I will be starting with those of you in Denture Out if you do 
 not pick up after your dogs. Thank you and Happy New Year.  That sure was a nice picture of the silver 1963 split window corvette on

 writing in the third person drives me nuts   lol. And I suspect that nuts list is long ...... 
 The poster that is always trying to disgrace the American 
 president said on here yesterday and Im quoting&quot;There was no 
 blood spilled on American soil by muslim fundamentialist 
 terrorist since 9-11&quot;again his words not mine.He then the next 
 sentence said&quot;That has now changed&quot;. I guess I missed an 
 attack on Americans that caused bloodshed here in the United 
 States in the last month and I would like to know what attack 
 occurred that spilled our blood? No one would be so low as to 
 politicize an attack against Americans simply for political 
 fodder would they especially if it was made up? You be the 
 judge.It seems to me to be someone so desperate to sell us 
 something they got caught up in their own hatred for our 
 president and reality got in the the way. Much like the Muslim 
 fundamentalist.I see quite a few similarities between the Muslim 
 Anti American fundamentalist and the extreme right wing Anti 
 American President folks.

  Guess who came home

 The single most often mentioned inducement 
 to support Obamacare is the claim that it will reduce the costs of 
 health care. Other inducements include the claim that it will reduce 
 the deficit, and that it will provide care for all Americans. Those 
 assertions are false. In December The Congressional Budget Office 
 determined that premiums in the healthcare insurance market will 
 rise by 10% to 13% more than if Congress did 
 nothing. Family policies under the status quo are projected to cost 
 $13,100 on average, but under ObamaCare will jump to $15,200. The 
 private policies will be taxed. Medical devices will be taxed. 
 Obamacare proposes to cut Medicaid and Medicare funding as a 
 stalking horse to hide the fact that Obamacare will actually 
 increase the public debt.  Worse, our elderly will see severely 
 diminished levels of care. The aforementioned funding cuts will 
 result in the individual states having to pay for those cuts. 
 Significantly increased state spending, will, without doubt require 
 significantly increased state taxes. You will pay! Many State 
 Attorneys General are preparing lawsuits to battle the unfunded 
 mandates. Some states are trying to figure a way to opt out.. Cuts 
 in Medicare have already caused the Mayo Clinic in Arizona to begin 
 denying service to Medicare patients. Many Docs now are refusing 
 Medicare and Medicaid patients. Medicare/Medicaid pays much less to 
 Doctors than does private insurance. Docs lose money on 
 Medicare/Medicaid patients. Those with private insurance are billed 
 a lot more to make up the physicians losses. That is the single 
 biggest reason that your health insurance premiums are so high. Many more Docs are prepared to stop accepting Medicare patients 
 if the Medicare/Medicaid fee schedules are cut further. If you think 
 this is Right Wing propaganda, just ask your Doctor, I did. The 
 current Obamacare package proposes to deliver subsidized health care 
 to an additional 31 million persons, many who are illegal aliens. 
 But it will still exclude about 20 million persons. It is impossible 
 to add 31 million new no fee clients without increasing the costs to 
 those who pay the bills. Hey folks, if its going to save money and 
 deliver better care, why not start right now? Why do they refuse to 
 begin delivering benefits even though fees and taxes will be 
 collected for the next four years? The benefits dont start until 
 the fifth year. For those CT readers with a short attention span: 
 Obamacare = Bad JuJu! 

 

 
 Youve gotta love our snowbirds, 
 without them many of our neighbors would not be our 
 neighbors. With no tourist service industry, our little rock 
 would be a really dull place; there just arent enough of us 
 locals to keep our service industry alive year around. 
 Having said that, a lot of the damn Yankees are a real pain 
 in the buttocks. One of the most annoying snowbird tricks is 
 to stop and park in the middle of Key Deer Blvd just to ogle 
 a deer. The dipshits just stop! We must assume that they 
 are afraid of the shoulder. If you beep, they stick an arm 
 out and wave at you to go around. If you pull alongside and 
 suggest that its really stupid to stop in the middle of the 
 freaking road, they give you a goofy smile and say But 
 were looking at that deer. Look, see as they point at a 
 (gasp) short deer. One driver actually said to me But 
 were from Cleveland. It no longer scares the deer if you 
 honk the horn, so short of mayhem there is little that can 
 be done. Oh well, summer is coming.

 New Year&apos;s Day 2010 
 You 
 know you live in the Keys when Cuba is closer than Wal-Mart. [ Hangover ] 
 Pickle juice and bacon are good for hangovers. The salts in them retain 
 water and after a two-sheets-to-the-wind kind of drunk, you need a lot 
 of liquid. Alcohol dehydrates you and you piss out the liquid in the 
 booze. Aspirin is good because alcohol constricts blood vessels abound 
 your noggin and aspirin relaxes the blood vessels. But it&apos;s not good for 
 your stomach which is probably already screwed up. 
 The best thing of all is to drink a big 
 glass or two of water before you go to bed and another when you get up 
 to pee. For a milder hangover drink clear liquors or white wine. Don&apos;t 
 drink sparkling wines because they get into your blood too fast, and 
 that&apos;s the same with any carbonated mixer. Dark rum and coke are the 
 worst. The sugar in the rum and the coke plus the carbonation in the 
 Coke is like an expressway to your hangover. 

 The worst thing you can do is to drink 
 everything that is offered. Remember the advice from a professional: 
 Never mix - never worry! 
 The local who defined a local is right on. If you 
 do not live here 12 months a year, you don&apos;t live here period. Those of 
 us who suffer the summer and economic difficulties those months bring 
 us, pay the price to be called locals. 
 



Happy 10th Anniversary to my wonderful wife, Lee Ann . And 
 Happy New Year! 
 [ Another 
 Snowbird Story ] After an exceptional day exploring the backcountry I 
 docked at the boat ramp on Little Torch around 5pm. There was a truck 
 and trailer all askew blocking the ramp with no boat to put on it in 
 sight. I retrieved my truck and trailer from the parking lot and parked 
 alongside the road waiting for the other truck to move so I could back 
 up onto the ramp and get my own boat. After waiting a while I became 
 impatient and went to see what the delay was. 

 I encountered 
 two woman from New York (It would have been perfect if they were from 
 Jersey). Seeing no boat, I told them that it was a local custom to have 
 a boat when using the ramp. They said they didnt want to wait for the 
 other boaters trying to use the ramp because they had waited long enough 
 already. One female said she got a phone call from her husband who said 
 he was coming with the boat. There still was no boat in sight. 

 I reiterated 
 that its customary to have a boat when using the ramp. I asked if she 
 would move; and that I could load mine and be out of there and home 
 before her husband arrived. The other female wished me a happy New Year. 

 I waited. 

 Finally I 
 heard a bunch of commotion and assumed that her husband had arrived. I 
 couldnt see because I stayed in my truck in order to stay away from the 
 New Yorkers least I get angry. The next thing I saw was a man climbing 
 over the 6 foot chain link fence put in place by the neighbor adjacent 
 to the ramp, I assume, to keep boaters out. He walked through their yard 
 and scaled the other fence running parallel to SR4A. I have no idea why 
 he had to do that other than being from New York. He straightened his 
 truck and trailer and after much ado loaded the boat and drove off.

 [ Reflections ] 
 As the new year approached I reflected back on 2009. Realizing my 
 mistakes, misfortunes, and lessons learned, I have made a promise 
 to love those who love me, keep my enemies closer, maintain my small 
 group of intimate friends, and take full responsibility for my actions. 
 Life is not promised tomorrow; therefore each day must be lived in full. 
 Keep loving strong and maintain a passion for love and life. Love is out 
 there, just grab hold of it and live, laugh and love as I am doing right 
 now. When life throws your lemon make lemonade! 
 [ Security 
 Unions ] A poster does not want the TSA workers to have a union 
 because they would have a say in his security and he doesnt feel safe 
 with a third party having a say. I suggest this poster demand the Police 
 Union and the Sheriffs Union to disband immediately for the safety of 
 the country. They are his first line of defense and they most likely 
 will have more of an effect on his safety then TSA workers. Also demand 
 the firefighters union to disband because we dont need their 3rd party 
 union having a hand in their negotiations. Maybe that poster is correct. 
 Im sure he wouldnt think that those unions would be any different, 
 would he? 
 Oh 
 noes! Rush Limbaugh is in the hospital suffering from chest 
 pains. Contrary to what you might assume this was not a heart attack. As 
 we all know he was born without one. Probably just indigestion from one 
 of the babies he eats for lunch (I keed, I keed!). I expect that today 
 we will not see a post from the From Das Reich guy or at best it will be 
 a rerun as he will be unable to get his talking points from El Rushbo. 
 Bummer. I 
 guess the right didn&apos;t enjoy the blue state/ red state joke. 
 Guns, guns, guns, which kind of fits the stereotype they were making fun 
 of in the joke. Perhaps we can put up a blue state border at Little 
 Torch? I&apos;d like to be in the nation with the smart people, the cheese, 
 the wine and the pineapples.

 [ Deadly 
 Cistern on No Name Key ] There are hundreds of non-chemist lay people 
 that are successfully implementing multi-level treatments systems and 
 generating potable quality water from cistern systems. In fact, most 
 users have the opposite opinion that you express. Most users of cistern 
 systems contend that they are capable of generating potable quality 
 water. I quite agree that a public system would relieve users of the 
 effort needed to produce good quality water from their cistern systems. 

 From your 
 description, it would seem that your best presentation would be 
 concerning possible chemical contamination of the rainwater which 
 requires costly remedial treatments. You will probably have to produce 
 evidence that your particular cistern system contains water contaminated 
 with specific chemical compounds.

 cannot offer more assistance.

 The Iguana Killers Club would 
 like to wish everybody, hunters and non-hunters alike a very happy and 
 successful new year. The goal for 2010 will be increasing our membership 
 to 500 avid hunters; we currently have approximately 200 IKC registered 
 hunters. Our long term goal will be to completely eradicate the invasive 
 iguana from Monroe County. As iguanas are invasive, not protected and 
 air rifles are not classed as firearms the IKC is working diligently 
 with the Department of Environmental Protection on a blanket permit to 
 hunt on all Federal and State lands, including the Great White Heron 
 Preserve and the National Key Deer Refuge. We are currently working on 
 our web site where you will be able to post your favorite iguana 
 experiences, photos and register to be a free lifetime member. 

 We are planning on having an Iguana roundup tournament on 
 the July 4 th weekend which will include a Miss Iguana Beauty 
 Pageant, exhibits, guest speakers, classes on how to clean and cook your 
 tree chickens, a knife and gun show and other various family friendly 
 events. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited at all IKC events as the IKC 
 promotes responsible engagement. 

 The IKC would like to thank all their sponsors for their 
 great support during 2009 and we hope to be able to continue our 
 tradition of exterminating the invasive iguana from the beautiful 
 Florida Keys. Happy hunting and happy news year to all.

 [ Panty bomber] Can someone tell me why the 
 bartender knew about the terrorist attack on Christmas 2 hrs before 
 Obama? Can someone tell me why Obama called the terrorist an isolated 
 extremist? Mr Obama, covering your eyes and putting fingers in your ears 
 will not make this go away. You need to man up! 
 
 [ From 
 the Right ] Our left wing posters say that Obama has simply followed 
 Bushs lead. Readers should be aware that most people think that Bush 
 made many serious errors. His decision to permit the civil criminal 
 trials of Muslim terrorists was a big mistake. We are now reaping what 
 was sowed. Obama has been President for about a year and has had plenty 
 of time to make changes or repairs. All Obama changed were the folks in 
 charge. The systems worked fine for several years, there was no blood 
 spilled on US soil by Muslim fundamentalist terrorist from 9/11 till the 
 end of the Bush Admin. That has now changed. Only blind luck or God 
 himself saved us on 12/25. There is no doubt that we will all recall 
 that Obama has generated tons of hot air and tons of CO2 denigrating the 
 Bush administration and its policies. It&apos;s a surprise that Al Gore 
 hasn&apos;t called him out on global warming issues. Obamas refusal to 
 accept responsibility for screw ups has become legendary and even 
 awkward for his supporters. It has become so routine that many 
 supporters are getting irritated with the dog ate my homework excuse 
 we hear at every turn from Obama and his minions.  It is now necessary 
 to ask if Bushs homeland security measures were so lax, then why did 
 Obama adopt them? Why have you kept them? What changes have you made? Why havent you made changes? How on Gods Green Earth was it possible 
 for the crotch bomber to get aboard that Delta flight? Why has Obama 
 given about 30 speeches about health care in the last year, but remained 
 virtually silent about homeland security? Why is socialized medicine a 
 higher priority than keeping us safe in our homes? 

 A year has 
 passed, yet Bush&apos;s systems and policies remain in place. The 
 administrators of the system are now Obama&apos;s hand picked choices. The 
 systems did not fail, the administration of the systems failed. Obamas 
 refusal to appreciate the fact that we are at war with an implacable 
 enemy is unforgivable. His intransigence will kill Americans. He must 
 realize that any amount of airport security such as searches of 
 passengers, etc, are doing nothing but treating the symptoms. We must 
 cure the disease--Muslim fundamentalism. We must implement deterrents 
 that are so unpalatable that our enemies will be unwilling to risk an 
 attack. 
 To survive, 
 our enemies must respect us, or they must fear us.  
 (Part II) 
 Happy New Year folks. If youre convinced that the sea level is rising; 
 youre right. If you think that its caused by global warming: youre 
 probably wrong. The sea has been rising for the last 10k to 15 thousand 
 years. Thats not a theory, thats an absolute fact. NOAA and a whole 
 slew of other sources agree that it has been rising on average at about 
 6-9 inches per century, every century, for the last 10k-15k years. Dont 
 confuse sea level rise with coastal erosion. NOAA has published data 
 that measured sea level rise from about 1913 until now. Sea level near 
 Tampa has risen by about 7 inches in that time. If you think thats a 
 crock, all you have to do is take a look at the early 1900s pictures 
 of the bridges under construction for Flaglers railroad (see below), 
 then take a look from todays same vantage point and come to you own 
 conclusions. I have, and can see little difference in the early 1900s 
 sea level and now. The Knights Key and Bahia Honda bridges are clearly
