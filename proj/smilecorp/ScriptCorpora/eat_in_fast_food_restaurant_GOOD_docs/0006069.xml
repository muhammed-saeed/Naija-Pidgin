 The golden age of porn lives on. A good rule of thumb: don&apos;t trust a naked guy unless it&apos;s after you&apos;ve already had sex with him.

If these propaganda posters were trying to convince us how weird they are, they&apos;re working. Are the words you are reading right now art? YOU DECIDE. Turns out Adele&apos;s been pregnant for the same length of time Rollin&apos; in the Deep was at number 1: nearly forever. Meet your area&apos;s hottest available douchebags! Another easy money-saving tip: time travel back to the days before inflation and triple your dollars&apos; value. R-Rated Hotlinks More Hotlinks
