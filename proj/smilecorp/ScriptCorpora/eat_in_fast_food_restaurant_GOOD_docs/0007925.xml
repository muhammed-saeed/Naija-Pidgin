Fast-Food Children’s Meals: Odds of Getting a Healthy One are Roughly 150–1
 
I recently posted here in defense of a San Francisco law requiring fast-food and other restaurants that offer toys along with certain children’s meals to limit the calories, fats and sugar content of the toy meals. This produced a number of comments taking issue with my position. I would like to respond to a few of the points the commenters made.

Today, I’d like to reply to this observation made by Kevin D.:
 “I believe you are…misrepresenting the nutritional value of the Happy Meal. For example, the Chicken Nugget Happy Meal with Apple Dippers and 1% milk represents less than 1/3 of the USDA recommended fat, sodium, and calories. If you choose fruit juice, you can lower the total even further, with 380 calories and 12 g of fat (only 2.5 of which is saturated).” 

He’s quite right in this regard. You can order the Happy Meal with apple slices instead of fries and juice instead of a soft drink. Moreover, most of the fast-food chains offer some form of“healthy”version of their standard kid’s meal. But there are two problems with this.

 First, the actual number of those healthy options is almost vanishingly small. Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity analyzed the nutritional information for kids’meals provided at eight major chains: McDonald’s, Wendy’s Taco Bell, KFC, Burger King, Dairy Queen and Subway. Out of a grand total of over 3,000 childrens’meal combinations, they found exactly 15 that met the accepted nutrition standards for elementary school kids. There were 20 more that met the kids’calorie limit, but exceeded other limits such as on fats and sodium. And while some offered as few as 300 calories, there were plenty that topped out at 1,000 or so. In short, a minuscule 0.7 percent of all possible kids’meals studied qualify as“healthy.”
 

The second problem is that you, the parent, have to know which chains offer the healthy options, and what those options are, and make a point of asking for them. At every chain but Subway, if you fail to specify otherwise, you’ll be given their default combo, which is in most cases is the entree (usually a burger or breaded chicken) plus fries and a sugary soda.

Since 84 percent of parents surveyed say they take their kids to a fast-food place at least once a week, the numbers mount up impressively. One Yale researcher estimated that if the healthier kid’s meal options were made the default choices, America’s youth would consume literally billions of fewer calories per year.
