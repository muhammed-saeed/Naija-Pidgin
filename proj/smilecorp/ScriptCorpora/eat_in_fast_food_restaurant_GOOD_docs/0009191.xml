 FDA: Regulatory science plan positions agency to foster innovation through better science 
 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released its&quot;Strategic Plan for Regulatory Science,&quot;calling for a sweeping modernization of the science used in developing and evaluating products critical to the nation&apos;s health, economy, and security. 

 &quot;The breadth and scope of FDA&apos;s regulatory oversight is extraordinary, touching the lives of every American, through the food they eat, the medicines they take, and the medical devices they use,&quot;said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D.&quot;As new discoveries yield increasingly complex products, this strategic plan ensures that our experts are equipped to make science-based decisions resulting in sound regulatory policy. It positions us to foster innovation through better science without compromising our high safety standard.&quot; 

 The plan provides specific details of the agency&apos;s Regulatory Science Initiative, outlined in October, 2010. 

 The strategic plan describes the agency&apos;s intent to collaboratively enhance the process for developing and evaluating promising new products and novel materials from fields such as cell therapy, tissue engineering, genomics, personalized medicine, advanced computing, and information technology. It also underscores the agency&apos;s emphasis on food safety. 

 The plan also emphasizes the agency&apos;s intention to study and improve how it communicates health information to consumers, particularly as communication technologies rapidly evolve and change the way people receive that information. 

 &quot;New technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to prevent and cure disease and to grow our high tech economy,&quot;said FDA Chief Scientist Jesse Goodman, M.D, M.P.H.&quot;This plan will help turn advances in science into products that benefit people, and help FDA assure that happens more quickly and safely. It is win-win-win, because it will help the public, the agency, and developers of new products.&quot; 

 The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation&apos;s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

 Consumers Continue to Drink More Coffee and Tea From Both Foodservice and Retail Settings, Finds Technomic 
 
Despite the specialty coffee craze at limited-service restaurants, regular hot coffee still accounts for the highest level of reported consumption among consumers surveyed by Technomic. Of consumers recently surveyed, 60 percent reported drinking regular hot coffee or tea within the last month, second only to the 62 percent of consumers who had a non-diet carbonated soft drink during the same time period.

 Technomic Vice President Joe Pawlak says understanding consumer motivations during various dayparts can help improve sales for operators and suppliers.&quot;Consumers who regularly purchase coffee on their way to work are motivated by the convenience of the location, but significantly, they are actually more motivated by the quality of the coffee, making them important loyal customers who return often, integrating the same locations into their normal routines.&quot;

In order to uncover insights and opportunities in coffee and tea, Technomic has developed the Market Intelligence Report: Coffee and Tea . Interesting findings include:

 Fourteen percent of consumers say they are making more purchases of regular hot coffee today than they did two years ago, and 10 percent say the same about iced tea by the cup or glass. Green tea, healthful and antioxidant-rich, is of interest to nearly three out of four consumers (73 percent),making it the most appealing flavor for hot or iced tea. In recent years, the number of green tea products has increased significantly on chain menus, according to MenuMonitor data. Lemon and honey are also appealing tea flavors for a sizeable percentage of consumers (61 percent and 60 percent, respectively). Overall, grocery, drug and mass-merchandise stores have experienced a nominal 15.9 percent increase in coffee sales from 2007-2010. Although each type of retailer saw a gain, mass merchandisers achieved the biggest increase (53.1 percent) to coffee sales of $318 million in 2010 from $208 million in 2007. While price increases played some role (see below), the rise is also due to mass merchandisers such as Target expanding their food and beverage offerings, increasing pressure on traditional food stores. With the exception of frozen/blended coffee drinks, all other types of coffee and tea drinks have steadily increased in price since 2008. Offered for an average price of $2.25 in 2008, regular coffee now sells for an average of $2.36. Similarly, tea/iced tea products have seen their prices go up, increasing from an average of $2.40 in 2008 to $2.57 two years later. 

 Market Intelligence Report: Coffee and Tea , like other titles in Technomic&apos;s growing series of Market Intelligence Reports, mines Technomic&apos;s treasure trove of recent consumer and industry data, including: Proprietary consumer research conducted for Technomic&apos;s Consumer Trend Reports and menu data and insights from Technomic&apos;s exclusive MenuMonitor online trend tracking resource (a constantly updated, searchable online database of menus of more than 1,200 top chains, emerging concepts and high-volume independent restaurants).

The report uses industry and trend data from Technomic&apos;s Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report and other publications, compiled in Technomic&apos;s exclusive Digital Resource Library , a unique online restaurant industry database. Syndicated retail data from SymphonyIRI adds perspective and allows for comparison of retail and foodservice trends. Rounding out the data are examples of restaurant industry successes with coffee and tea, including the new products and hot concepts driving innovation.

 FDA Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Interactive Resource Disk Available 
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is releasing the Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Interactive Resource Disk for use by foodservice establishments and retail food stores in preventing transmission of foodborne pathogens that are often transmitted by sick food employees. The disk includes an interactive tool to assist the persons in charge of these establishments make the correct decisions to prevent sick employees from working with food. In addition, it contains several FDA resource documents such as the 2009 FDA Food Code, an Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook, a recording of a satellite broadcast on “Using Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Measures,” and education and training materials in multiple languages on employee health and personal hygiene.

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention annually publishes a list of infectious and communicable diseases that are transmitted through food and the FDA Food Code lists five of the pathogens that have high infectivity and are easily transmitted to food by sick employees. These pathogens, referred to as the “Big 5,” are: Norovirus, Hepatitis A virus, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 or other Enterohemorrhagic or Shiga toxin-producing E. coli .
 In order to prevent transmission of the&quot;Big 5&quot;to food or to other persons, it is important that all employees working with food are fully aware of their responsibility to report symptoms, diagnosis, past illness, and history of exposure associated with these pathogens. The interactive tool follows a question and answer format and focuses on symptoms associated with the “Big 5” pathogens, including vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and sore throat with fever. When the person in charge is informed of employee symptoms or learns of a diagnosis, he or she can use the interactive tool to determine whether to notify the regulatory authority, whether to have the employee sent home or to remain at work, and when to allow the employee to return to work. or a health practitioner. The disk is not to be used as a substitute for state and local regulatory requirements. 
The disk is a tool that quickly provides the information needed to prevent a sick food employee from transmitting a foodborne disease. It is not meant to be used as a tool to diagnose foodborne disease or as a substitute for consultation with a regulatory authority.

Women are placing the&quot;ale&quot;in female for Taste of Brews, an entirely new craft beer tasting festival that is heading to Lighthouse Park in Long Beach on Saturday, August 20, 2011. Taste of Brews features more than 100 beers from 50 local, regional and international breweries and brewpubs paired alongside cuisine from high-end gastropubs and fabulous eateries. The all-inclusive admission includes unlimited craft beer tastes and food samples, along with snacks, water and more.  

Women are fueling interest and driving advance sales to Taste of Brews&apos;inaugural event. Slightly more than 50 percent of tickets have been purchased by females, far exceeding the 27 percent national average for beer drinkers. Women also represent the business of brewing and selling craft beer at the festival; Hayley Shine is the brewmaster at Rock Bottom and Kerry Caldwell is the assistant brewer at Belmont Brewing, both are Long Beach brewpubs. 

&quot;Women are a large and growing market for craft breweries,&quot;said Taste of Brews event director Jennifer Hernandez. &quot;It&apos;s exciting to see the passion and excitement that full-flavored craft beers are generating among women attending Taste of Brews.&quot;

While Taste of Brews boasts strong ties to Long Beach, breweries from 12 states and eight countries are also participating. Neighboring communities are represented by the Inland Empire, El Segundo and San Pedro Brewing Companies. Sudwerk Brewing brings its Bay area flavor while Alaskan Brewing symbolizes the great outdoors. International craft beers include Peroni (Italy), Xingu (Brazil), St. Peter&apos;s (UK) and Lhasa (Tibet).

Many popular craft beers like Shock Top, New Belgium, Firestone, Blue Moon and Pyramid are participating, while the Belgian family of Stella Artois, Leffe and Hoegaarden are featured in the VIP lounge. Harder to locate brands Cismontane, Green Flash, Shipyard, Sea Dog and Black Market infuse fresh energy. 

An official event of the Long Beach Sea Fest, Taste of Brews kicks off the festivities at noon with live music and an entertaining MC. Ticket prices begin at $40 with proceeds benefiting the Long Beach Marine Institute. General admission attendees will sample among dozens of brands and savor local fare. Premium VIP packages take the tasting experience to a heightened level with early entry and a Belgian lounge.

 Professional Certification Gives Chefs Leverage When Seeking Employment and Promotion in Recovering Economy, ICE President Says 
 
he U.S. restaurant industry continues to recover after several economically challenging years. During this time in which many culinary professionals are seeking work or are striving to validate their skills to employers, many find that professional certification is key to maintaining a competitive edge in the industry. Now, professionals who hold the Certified Executive Chef ® (CEC ® ) designation through the American Culinary Federation (ACF) can boast that their certification is accredited by Washington, D.C.-based National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).

 “I am here to say that credentials matter and certification matters. Nearly 11,000 culinarians have credentials through ACF’s 14 levels of certification, which makes it clear that you understand this, as well,” said Melissa Murer Corrigan, president of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE), the parent organization of NCCA, during the 2011 ACF National Convention General Session in Dallas, July 23. “You can be even more confident that the certification granted will give you the ability to rise above the competition, which is very important in this market.”

At the national convention, Certification Commission Chair Derek Spendlove, CEPC ® , CCE ® , AAC, announced that the CEC designation is the first of ACF’s certifications to undergo and receive NCCA accreditation for a five-year period.

“ACF began pursuing accreditation in 2007 as a means of validating our certification program to increase value, creditability and recognition amongst industry professionals,” said Spendlove. “We are proud to receive NCCA accreditation for our first designation. We are currently in the process of accrediting our Certified Sous Chef™ (CSC™) designation and will seek accreditation for our Certified Executive Pastry Chef ® (CEPC ® ) designation in 2013. Gaining accreditation is a long journey, but approval from a neutral, external party such as NCCA is paramount to the certification program’s success.”

To receive NCCA accreditation ACF submitted an application demonstrating the program’s compliance with NCCA’s 21 “Standards for the Accreditation of Certification Programs.” Currently, more than 100 organizations representing more than 250 programs, from physicians to nurses and now chefs, have NCCA accreditation.

ACF has been certifying cooks and chefs since 1974 through various quality certification programs. ACF offers 14 levels of certification based on skills, knowledge, integrity and equality through an achievable process for all culinary professionals. Certification is based on education, experience and successful completion of both a written and practical exam.
