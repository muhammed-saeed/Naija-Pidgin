 Counterpoint / TimCo Foods Inc. explains its side of the controversy in St. George 
 posted on January 31, 2011 by Greg McMillan 

Dear Residents of St. George,

The purpose of this document is to clarify any misunderstandings about TIMCO’s business and its operations within St. George.

Over last few weeks, TIMCO FOODS LTD. has faced many allegations from a group of St. George citizens who are concerned about the nature of TIMCO’s business. It is more than clear, by the responses and accusations contained in a widely circulated flyer from the above group, that the very nature of the processes involved has been misunderstood.

TIMCO FOODS does not, nor ever will, process animal carcass waste. 

Our processes are limited to the use of edible animal fats only. These fats are maintained in refrigerated facilities, transported in a refrigerated truck to our facilities and is placed into refrigerated storage upon delivery to the plant. The business of TIMCO FOODS is the production of edible oil products.

It should be noted that TIMCO’s plant can only operate with the proper licenses and supervision from Health Canada’s Health Protection Branch, The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), and the Ontario Ministry of Environment. In order to obtain and operate with the required licenses, TIMCO must demonstrate a high level of compliance with the rules and regulations enforced by these governing bodies.

To assist us with any environmental concerns, TIMCO is working with an environmental engineer with over 20 years of experience within the same industry (AMEC). All of TIMCO’s processes at the plant will be carefully studied by the environmental engineer, and TIMCO’s neutral impact on the environment will continue to be a top priority.

No new company can hope to be a success without the support and approval of the surrounding community. TIMCO has listened to your concerns, and will continue to listen to and act upon your concerns, to ensure that St. George will remain a safe and healthy place to live and work and play. 

Included in this document are some definitions, a description of our process and answers to some of your questions.

Sincerely,
Raj Selvaratnam
President and CEO
TIMCO FOODS LTD.

 Rendering 
Rendering is a form of recycling that transforms animal waste into valued-added products. There are two types of rendering: i) edible rendering and ii) inedible rendering.

TIMCO FOODS is in the edible rendering business and the company will soon apply for a license with Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Foods, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) to operate as a freestanding meat plant. TIMCO will transform more than 99% of its raw material–edible fat trimmings–into value-added products to be used in human consumable products.

Edible oil rendering; can be defined as,“Processing edible animal fatty tissues into edible oils and proteins for human consumption”

Edible rendering plants such as TIMCO are subject to inspection and processing standards established by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), and the Ministry of the Environment (MOE). It must also comply with standards set out by the Department of Health and Safety. Edible tallow or lard (i.e. edible oil) is produced from beef or pork fatty tissue, respectively, to be used in the production of human consumable products. In the case of edible rendering operations, emissions are insignificant because no cooking vapours are emitted and direct heat contact with the edible fat is minimal.

Inedible rendering: Processing inedible animal waste products (i.e. bone, hide, offal, feathers, and blood) into fats and proteins for animal feed and inedible applications. Due to the nature of this business, inedible rendering plants are subject to strict rules and regulations by its governing bodies. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the primary air pollutants emitted from inedible rendering. VOCs are considered an odour nuisance in residential areas in close proximity to inedible rendering plants, and emission controls are directed toward odour elimination.

For inedible rendering operations, the primary sources of VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions are the cookers and the screw press. Raw material (i.e. bone, hide, offal, feathers, blood, and dead stocks) may also be a source of VOC emissions, but if the material is processed in a timely manner, these emissions are minimal. Since TIMCO uses a closed loop process, with no exposed stages, the production of atmospheric VOCs are negligible.

 Processing 
TIMCO is a premier manufacturer of edible oil from edible fat trimmings. Edible fat trimmings (i.e. raw material) from beef, pork and lamb meat are available at local butcher shops (i.e. raw material suppliers).

 Raw Material Pickup 
Closed-lid storage containers are provided to local butcher shops to store the clean edible fat trimmings. Only fat trimmings will be placed in these containers and these containers must be kept in the butcher shops’coolers until pickup. Using TIMCO’s refrigerated medium-duty commercial truck; the containers are transported from the butcher shops to TIMCO’s processing plant in St. George, Ontario. Upon arrival at the plant, the containers are immediately taken into a refrigerated storage area. It is very important for the fat trimmings to be refrigerated until processing so that it does not become unsuitable for edible product processing.

 The Process 
The following figure shows a high-level view of TIMCO’s overall process. This is a closed-system operation that uses steam to melt fat trimmings to produce edible oil. To separate the edible oil from other solid particles, the fat trimmings undergo a series of steps as outlined in the figure below.



 The fat trimmings are ground through a grinder and conveyed to a melt tank equipped with an agitator and steam-heated jacket. 
 The fatty tissue is melted at 120˚F and pumped to a disintegrator to rupture the fat cells. 
 The first centrifuge separates any protein from the melted fat. 
 The melted fat then enters a feed tank and is maintained at 120˚F by a shell-and-tube heat exchanger with steam. 
 The second centrifuge separates the finished edible oil from sediment (a combination of water and fine protein particles). 
 The edible oil is pumped into heated storage vessels. 
 At the product recovery stage, sediment is separated from the water (mainly wash water). 
 Our Products 
Edible Oils (Primary)

TIMCO manufactures edible oils, commonly known as animal shortening, tallow and lard. Most restaurants use tallow and lard for frying French fries, home fries, donuts, onions, and chicken. Lard is commonly used in many cuisines as a cooking fat, shortening, or as a spread similar to butter. It remains preferred by many contemporary chefs for bakery products, icing, filling, and all frying purposes. Edible oils can also be used for inedible applications.

TIMCO can sell the edible oils for inedible applications. Tallow and lard can be used for many purposes, such as livestock feed, soap, candles, and cosmetics. It can also be used as a raw material for the production of biodiesel and other oleo chemicals, ointments, suppositories, and pill coatings.

Edible Protein (Secondary)
TIMCO will be selling the edible protein to animal food production companies.

Sediment (Tertiary)
TIMCO will sell the sediment to farmers and fertilizer manufacturers for use in fertilizers.

 Food Safety 
Food safety is a top priority for TIMCO. TIMCO is committed to implementing the best food processing practices. In order to obtain a license from OMAFRA to operate as a freestanding meat plant, TIMCO must comply with the highest standards set by the Food Safety and Quality Act, 2001. In order be provincially licensed, TIMCO will focus on the following major hazard areas:



 Proper hand washing procedure, clothing (i.e. white lab coats and hair nets) and foot wear. 
 Receipt and storage of fat trimmings is done through a refrigerated process to ensure that the raw material does not become spoiled. 
 Sanitation procedures will outline the ways the machinery will be cleaned and washed on a regular basis. 
 Equipment maintenance procedures will include preventive maintenance and calibration monitoring. 
 Pest control will be put in place not only for the extermination of pests, but also to help prevent unwanted infiltrations in the future. 
 Concerns 
 Water Pollution 
Recently, there have been concerns raised about contaminants in the wastewater from TIMCO’s plant potentially ending up in the water table. The majority of the water used in the process has been heated to above the point of sterilization along with any of the organic contaminants. 

As the industrial park does not have sanitary sewers, it will be necessary to install a septic treatment system. Any wastewater treatment system must comply with MOE standards and any system design must be approved by the Ministry and be specific to the wastewater contaminant levels and quantities that will exist. TIMCO will only release safe and approved water into the water table.

Until TIMCO’s treated wastewater control system is approved by the Ministry of the Environment to be released into the water table through the septic system, the wastewater will be hauled away by a licensed tanker to a wastewater treatment plant. This temporary procedure will be very similar to the way tankers haul away waste in the area. The tanker will be taking the wastewater directly from the plant. 

Air Pollution 
TIMCO is an edible rendering plant or food processing plant making edible products for human consumption. A misunderstanding occurs when TIMCO’s operation is comparable to Rothsay’s overall business. TIMCO does not bring animal bones, offal, carcasses, etc to be processed in its plant. TIMCO only takes clean trimmed edible pork, beef and lamb fat trimmings from butcher shops into the plant, which are stored in closed containers. This edible fat is transported in TIMCO’s refrigerated transport vehicle so that it does not become spoiled during transportation. The edible fat stays refrigerated in the plant before being processed; during processing, it remains within a closed system.

 Questions and Answers 
 What is the difference between Timco’s operation and that of Rothsay on Hwy 5 in Flamborough? 
Rothsay on HWY 5 is an inedible rendering plant. An inedible plant takes animal waste (i.e. bones, offal, and carcasses of animals) and makes usable, but inedible products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the primary air pollutants emitted from inedible rendering. VOCs are considered an odour nuisance in residential areas in close proximity to inedible rendering plants, and emission controls are directed toward odour elimination.

TIMCO is not in the inedible rendering business, and by virtue of its process and material handling, releases only negligible amounts of VOCs to the atmosphere.

 What other plants are there in Ontario with similar meat processing operations? 
Companies such as Quality Meats and Maple Leaf Foods manufacture similar edible oils as those produced by TIMCO. These edible fat processing plants are integrated, whereas TIMCO is independent. Integrated meat processing plants are operated in conjunction with animal slaughter-houses and poultry processing plants. This type of plant processes the edible fat into edible oils, and is integral to the slaughterhouse or meat packing operation. Independent food processing plants such as TIMCO collect the raw material from off-site sources that do not have the facilities to produce edible oil.

 What is the level of odour emission produced by TIMCO’s operation? 
Odour emissions from edible rendering plants are insignificant. Since no cooking vapours are emitted from the edible rendering process, and heat contact with the edible fat is minimal, there are only negligible amounts of VOCs. The lack of odour is also due to the freshness of the raw material being processed and that the plant sanitation and housekeeping practices that have been established by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA).

TIMCO’s level of odour emission will be less than that of a fast food restaurant. The raw material is fresh and odourless since it is always refrigerated. Once the fat is trimmed and placed in the containers at the butcher shops, it goes straight into coolers. Using TIMCO’s refrigerated medium-duty commercial truck, the containers are transported from the butcher shops to TIMCO’s processing plant in St. George. Upon arrival at the plant, the containers are immediately taken into a refrigerated storage area. The entire edible fat processing procedure is a closed system, thus it does not allow any air emissions to be released.

 What volume of commercial traffic is anticipated on HWY 24 and HWY 5 due TIMCO’s operation? 
TIMCO’s transport vehicle is no bigger than an ice cream truck. The truck will come into the plant at most 3-5 times a day. It will not affect the traffic in any way. The transport truck is fully refrigerated, and no odour of any kind will be emitted during travel. TIMCO’s finished edible oil is pumped out to a tanker, and picked up not more than once a day when the plant is operating at its maximum capacity. TIMCO’s operation will not have any impact on the volume of commercial traffic on HWY 24 or HWY 5.

 How is TIMCO being regulated by Ontario for emissions (i.e. water, odour, noise, etc.)? 
TIMCO will be regulated by Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), and the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) upon obtaining any necessary licenses. An inspector from OMAFRA will have an office at TIMCO, and will be present 2-3 times a week. Just like any other meat processing plant, cleanliness is mandatory. The plant is sanitized and maintained daily. Any discharges into the water table or air are regulated by the MOE. TIMCO is working with a reputable environmental engineering consulting company to analyze potential hazards, establish and characterize control points important to safe manufacturing practices, and determine points of process that are critical to finished product integrity. OMAFRA’s license and MOE’s approvals will only be granted after TIMCO can demonstrate safe manufacturing practices within the St. George community. Until TIMCO can demonstrate that the wastewater from its operation is within the acceptable limits set by MOE, no wastewater will be discharged into the water table until approval.

 Will TIMCO manufacture inedible products in the future? 
From a technical, environmental and business point of view, TIMCO will not manufacture inedible products through inedible rendering processes. By definition, TIMCO’s machinery only allows for edible food processing to take place. From a business point of view, edible oil is sold at a higher price per kilogram compared to inedible oil. Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) will only provide approvals for edible rendering plants. Inedible rendering creates an odour nuisance in residential areas in close proximity to the plant. TIMCO aims to be a positive member of the St. George community, and will focus only on safe and healthy engineering and business practices.

Over the next couple of weeks, we will be setting up a discussion forum on our website to allow our new neighbors to become engaged in this process. This forum will be monitored on an ongoing basis so please feel free to ask your questions or just to add your comments. 

We believe that being part of a community means more than just supplying new jobs. It means being engaged and proactive. We would prefer this relationship to be proactive as opposed to re-active. The ongoing success of our new company will depend, for a large part, on how well we are regarded in the community.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify our business plans and maybe to correct some misunderstandings.
