Company Perspectives:

&quot;When I created Chipotle in 1993, I had a very simple idea: Offer a simple menu of great food prepared fresh each day, using many of the same cooking techniques as gourmet restaurants. Then serve the food quickly, in a cool atmosphere. It was food that I wanted, and thought others would like too. We&apos;ve never strayed from that original idea. The critics raved and customers began lining up at my tiny burrito joint. Since then, we&apos;ve opened a few more.&quot; --Steve Ells, founder and CEO

Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. is one of the leading fast-casual Mexican restaurant chains, with approximately 400 outlets in about 20 states, mainly in the West and Midwest. Known for its fresh, gourmet , and increasingly organic ingredients, Chipotle (pronounced chi-POAT-lay) offers a fairly simple menu of burritos, fajitas , and tacos featuring pork, shredded beef, chicken, steak , and vegetarian fillings. Customer checks average about $8.50. From a single location in Denver, Colorado, in 1993, the chain is now growing at the rate of 100 new restaurants per year thanks to the deep pockets of its parent, fast-food giant McDonald&apos;s Corporation. McDonald&apos;s first invested in the company in 1998, before taking majority control the following year, and it now holds a 90 percent stake. The vast majority of Chipotle restaurants are company-owned; fewer than ten are franchised. Annual revenues per unit are an estimated $1.2 million.

Born on September 12, 1965, in Indianapolis, Steve Ells, the founder and CEO of Chipotle, developed a deep interest in cuisine, cooking, and restaurant eating at an early age. He told Nation&apos;s Restaurant News in January 1999 that in family travels across the United States and Europe he had an opportunity to taste many different foods and to develop an appreciation for fine cuisine at an unusually young age. Instead of cartoons, he was interested in watching Julia Child cooking shows. &quot;When I was in fourth grade, I used to make eggs Benedict before I had to catch the school bus.&quot;

Ells attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he received an art history degree in 1988. He then decided to pursue his lifelong interest in fine food by attending the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. After graduating in 1990, he worked for two years at the high-end Stars restaurant in San Francisco under famed chef Jeremiah Tower. His inspiration for creating Chipotle, however, came from his frequent off-hour visits to little taquerias in San Francisco&apos;s Mission District. There he was struck by the fat burritos prepared to order, everything bundled in a giant flour tortilla wrapped in foil . Ells&apos;s idea was to put a twist on this traditional Mexican peasant food by stuffing the tortillas with gourmet ingredients, leveraging his culinary knowledge.

After a year of planning during which he arranged an $80,000 loan and persuaded his father, a former president of the pharmaceuticals firm Syntex Corporation, to invest an additional $85,000, the then 27-year-old Ells returned to the Denver area, where he had lived during his junior/senior high years, to open the first Chipotle Mexican Grill. It was named after a smoked and dried jalapeño pepper that figured prominently among the ingredients, particularly the marinades used to flavor the meats. Located on Evans Avenue in Denver near the campus of the University of Denver, the restaurant opened in July 1993. The configuration of the restaurant made for a somewhat rough beginning. The kitchen was in the back, and customers and employees had to yell back and forth during ordering. Ells soon developed an open-kitchen design in which the food prep was brought out front, and the customers could interact directly with the staff and have more control over the food they were ordering.

The simple menu enabled customers to choose among burrito , taco, and fajita items; select a filling of steak, chicken, pork carnitas , or vegetarian; and then add various other fillings or toppings--all as they moved along a serving line. The huge burritos, weighing a pound and a quarter and wrapped in enormous 14-inch flour tortillas, held rice and beans in addition to the aforementioned fillings. All the ingredients were of high quality and fresh, and Ells put special gourmet touches on nearly everything: cilantro and lime juice in the rice; chopped serranos, more cilantro, and marinated red onions in the guacamole ; romaine lettuce rather than the typical iceberg in the tacos. In an early rave review, Bill St. John, writing in the Rocky Mountain News enthused: &quot;Nothing is plain here; everything has depth, character, nuance , layers of flavor.&quot; The main items on the menu were quite reasonably priced, initially ranging from $3.95 to $4.55. Among the drink offerings were margaritas and beer.

After working out the initial kinks , the first Chipotle became a huge hit. Ells&apos;s father got his investment back within a month or so. Over the next few years, more outlets were opened in the Denver metro area, funded by an additional $1.5 million investment by Ells&apos;s father and a $1.5 million private stock offering. The second store opened in February 1995, and then six more debuted during 1996. Ells concentrated first on siting restaurants in Denver&apos;s trendier neighborhoods before moving into the suburbs. Backing this growth initiative and adding efficiency to the overall operations was the addition of a central commissary where some of the ingredients were prepared. By this time, Chipotle was considered a pioneer in two national restaurant trends: so-called wraps and the fast-casual sector. The latter category encompassed chains that were a bit fancier than typical fast-food restaurants such as Taco Bell and a bit faster than casual-dining chains such as Chevys. Each Chipotle was estimated to be generating just over $1 million in annual sales at this time. Sales were divided about 50-50 between eat-in and carry-out customers. Chipotle&apos;s clientele was mainly composed of adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a contrast to most fast-food restaurants, which catered to teenagers and families.

Whereas the first Chipotle was a cramped 800 square feet in size, the subsequent units covered 1,600 to 2,800 square feet, and they employed about 17 workers each. Although the design differed from unit to unit, the architecture aimed for a hip, urban feel. The decor was spare and industrial: halogen lighting, metal tabletops, wooden benches and seats, concrete floors, and arched metal ceilings. At this time, design and construction costs totaled about $249,000 per unit. Also noteworthy during this initial period of growth was that Chipotle did little in the way of advertising or promotion, relying instead on word-of-mouth testimonials.

As six more Chipotle Mexican Grills opened in the Denver area during 1997, bringing the total to 14, Ells and other company leaders were seeking more funding to accelerate the growth rate. Venture capital firms were more interested in the high-flying tech world at the time, so a member of the Chipotle board of directors sent an unsolicited business plan to fast-food leader McDonald&apos;s Corporation. The timing was perfect. Domestic sales were flattening at the burger giant, and executives were seeking a way to jump-start growth. In February 1998, after a year of negotiations and due diligence , McDonald&apos;s made its first-ever investment in a restaurant chain it did not itself develop, buying a minority stake in Chipotle. (Later, it bought the Boston Market chain and owned the Donatos Pizza chain for a few years.) Chipotle continued to be run independently, headed by Ells as CEO, and neither its management structure nor its menu changed. Growth would continue to be generated through company-owned outlets--now with the backing of much deeper pockets--but there was the clear potential for franchising, eventually, through McDonald&apos;s system of franchisees.

Following the McDonald&apos;s infusion , Chipotle began expanding outside of Colorado, sometimes aided by McDonald&apos;s expertise in site selection. Two units were opened in Kansas City (one in Kansas and one in Missouri) in 1998, and several new markets were entered in 1999: Chicago; Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Dallas; and Washington, D.C. The restaurant count more than doubled in 1999, ending at 37. Revenues for the year totaled approximately $31 million, compared to $13 million for 1997. McDonald&apos;s increased its stake in Chipotle to more than 50 percent in 1999 and would later bump its ownership interest to 90 percent.

Another early benefit of the McDonald&apos;s relationship was that Chipotle could leverage McDonald&apos;s industry clout in, for example, getting a better supplier of avocados . Chipotle was also able to have supplies such as avocados shipped immediately through McDonald&apos;s massive distribution system. Such access was indispensable as Chipotle&apos;s operations spread out geographically.

Expansion accelerated in the early 2000s, with the store count reaching 100 by the end of 2000 and then 175 at year-end 2001. Among the new markets were Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. A McDonald&apos;s franchisee began operating two Chipotle units in Dayton, Ohio, but there was not yet a major move into franchising the concept. During 2001 Chipotle dropped the phrase &quot;Mexican Grill&quot; from the name of its restaurants (though the company name itself did not change). Officials at the chain reasoned that &quot;Mexican Grill&quot; had become too commonly used throughout the industry and might prove limiting, given that the menu already went well beyond typical Mexican fare. Around this same time, the company made the first significant changes to the menu since the first store opened. In addition to fine-tuning the recipe for its homemade guacamole, Chipotle switched to free-range pork for its carnitas. The supplier, Oakland, California-based Niman Ranch, raised its pigs &quot;naturally&quot;; Niman allowed them to roam free and did not feed them antibiotics . The result, according to Ells, was better-tasting pork. To use the higher-end and higher-priced product, Chipotle had to raise the price of its pork burritos by more than $1, to $5.50, but sales hardly suffered. Ells told Nation&apos;s Restaurant News in July 2001 that &quot;our customers can&apos;t get enough of the new recipe. ... In fact, we are selling two-and-a-half times more carnitas than before, and sales continue to rise.&quot; Food industry research and consulting firm Technomic estimated that overall revenues at Chipotle more than doubled in 2001, reaching $145 million.

About 55 more Chipotles opened in 2002 and another 70 the following year, bringing the total to 300. As it celebrated its tenth anniversary, Chipotle ranked as one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the country. The chain entered the Las Vegas, Atlanta, and New York markets, among others, in 2003, by which time Technomic estimated revenues at $321 million. Same-unit sales (that is, sales at units open more than one year) were growing at an impressive rate of 20 percent per year. Late in 2003 McDonald&apos;s announced, contrary to earlier rumors, that it would sell neither Chipotle nor Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black (it soon sold Donatos Pizza, however). Chipotle remained a major growth avenue for McDonald&apos;s.

Continuing to upgrade his food ingredients, Ells switched from yellow corn, which could contain genetically modified stock, to organic white corn, which did not have any genetically modified stock. He also began switching to organic beans, but a shortage of suppliers meant that Chipotle could get only 10 percent of the beans it needed from organic sources. In addition, he was running into similar problems finding suppliers of organic chicken. By mid-2004 Chipotle was offering naturally raised, antibiotic-free chicken from Bell&amp;Evans in 50 restaurants in Washington, D.C., New York, and Ohio. Eight restaurants in Chicago and New York were using naturally raised beef.

Starting with 2004, Chipotle increased its growth rate to 100 new units per year, aiming to hit the 500 restaurant mark by the end of 2005. The chain expanded into the Pacific Northwest by entering the Seattle and Portland, Oregon, markets and also moved into Florida, specifically Orlando and Tampa. Chipotle also beefed up its marketing efforts by hiring its first outside advertising agency, the New York office of an irreverent British agency, Mother. Chipotle had been producing its own humorous radio, print, and billboard ads featuring a photo of a burrito wrapped in foil accompanied by brief, witty copy, such as &quot;A complete, four-course meal in a handy tortilla carrying pouch &quot; or &quot;Burrito? Or body pillow ?&quot; Chipotle&apos;s marketing budget was estimated to be $10 million per year. Another development was an addition to the menu in response to the low-carb diet craze : Chipotle began offering its burritos and fajitas in a bowl, sans tortilla, and with romaine lettuce standing in for rice.

By late 2004, with the store count nearing 400, nothing appeared to be slowing Chipotle&apos;s remarkable growth. Ells had made only small changes to the still-simple menu in the 11-plus years he had been in business, and he continued to seek out new sources for organic ingredients. &quot;It&apos;s not just about fresh anymore; fresh is sort of the minimum that you have to do in this category now,&quot; Ells told Nation&apos;s Restaurant News in October 2004. &quot;You have to be concerned where your food comes from and how the animals were raised. I call it &apos;Food with Integrity.&apos;&quot; Backed by the cash-rich McDonald&apos;s, Ells was positioned to maintain the rapid growth of Chipotle: &quot;I think there&apos;s a huge demand in the U.S. for the brand. And so the challenge is to improve the experience and deliver it to more and more people.&quot;

 History 
 The first Chipotle near the campus of the University of Denver 
Founder Steve Ells attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York . Afterward, he became a line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco, California . [ 8 ] There, Ells observed the popularity of the taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District . In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco [ 13 ] and opened the first Chipotle ( 39°40′42″N 104°58′04″W ﻿ / ﻿ 39.67834°N 104.967682°W ﻿ / 39.67834; -104.967682 ) in Denver , Colorado , in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream Store near the University of Denver campus using an $85,000 loan from his father. [ 11 ] Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. [ 14 ] The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle&apos;s cash flow , and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells&apos; father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. [ 15 ] In 1999, the first restaurants outside of Colorado opened in Columbus, Ohio , and Minneapolis, Minnesota . [ 16 ] Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] 

In 1998, McDonald&apos;s made an initial minority investment in the company. By 2001, the company had grown to be Chipotle&apos;s largest investor. [ 11 ] The investment from McDonald&apos;s allowed the firm to quickly expand, from 16 restaurants in 1998 to over 500 by 2005. [ 19 ] On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market . The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth. [ 14 ] 
 Distribution of Chipotle restaurants throughout North America as of December 2011 [update] [ 12 ] 
In October 2006, McDonald&apos;s fully divested from Chipotle. [ 20 ] This was part of a larger initiative for McDonald&apos;s to divest all of its non-core business restaurants – Chipotle, Donato&apos;s Pizza , and Boston Market – so that it could squarely focus on the main McDonald&apos;s chain. [ 21 ] McDonald&apos;s invested approximately $360 million into Chipotle, and took out $1.5 billion. [ 15 ] The company currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange . [ 14 ] 

Competitors in the fast-casual Mexican market include Qdoba Mexican Grill , Moe&apos;s Southwest Grill , Rubio&apos;s Fresh Mexican Grill , Panchero&apos;s Mexican Grill , and Baja Fresh . [ 22 ] In a list of fastest-growing restaurant chains in 2009, Chipotle was ranked eighth, based on increases in U.S. sales over the past year, [ 23 ] and in 2010 Chipotle was ranked third. [ 24 ] Consumer Reports ranked Chipotle as the best Mexican fast-food chain in 2011. [ 25 ] The company has approximately 750,000 customers per day. [ 26 ] 

In December 2010, Chipotle hired chef Nate Appleman to develop new cuisine. Appleman has won Rising Star Chef from the James Beard Foundation , was named &quot;Best New Chef&quot; by Food&amp;Wine magazine, and competed on The Next Iron Chef . [ 27 ] 

In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle&apos;s Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C, [ 30 ] which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General&apos;s office in Washington D.C. joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20-25 restaurants in other locations such as Los Angeles, CA and Atlanta, GA . [ 31 ] In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Greg Craig . [ 32 ] In addition, a Mexican citizen is suing Chipotle for &quot;mental anguish and suffering&quot;, claiming racial and national discrimination because a Minnesota restaurant allegedly refused to acknowledge his Mexican passport as a valid identification for an alcohol purchase. [ 33 ] 

In 2011, Steve Ells was a judge for the TV show, America&apos;s Next Great Restaurant and investor of ANGR Holdings , the company that will be running the winning concept&apos;s restaurants. Chipotle has agreed to purchase Ell&apos;s investment in ANGR at his cost, provide support for ANGR operations, and invest a total of $2.3 million in cash contributions. [ 34 ] 

 Operation and distribution 
 The second Chipotle Mexican Grill location in London, located on Baker Street 
All of Chipotle&apos;s restaurants are company-owned, rather than franchised . [ 35 ] As of April 2012 [update] , 1262 restaurants have since opened throughout the United States and Canada, with locations in 41 states, Ontario, and the District of Columbia. [ 12 ] [ 36 ] Chipotle has expanded to Europe, with the first European restaurant opened in May 2010 in London, England , [ 4 ] [ 37 ] and a location opened in Paris, France in May 2012. [ 38 ] Founder Steve Ells serves as chairman and co-chief executive officer , [ 39 ] and has a 1.25% stake in the company. [ 37 ] 

In September 2011, Chipotle opened an Asian fast-casual concept restaurant named ShopHouse Southeast Asian Grill in Washington, D.C. [ 40 ] The company has said the new restaurant &quot;would follow the Chipotle service format and its focus on &apos;food with integrity&apos; in ingredients.&quot; [ 41 ] Chipotle will start with only one store, and see how the restaurant works out. [ 42 ] ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen features &quot;cuisine inspired by Thai, Malaysian and Vietnamese cuisines&quot; [ 43 ] served in bowls or as banh mi sandwiches. [ 38 ] 

 Menu 
 A Chipotle restaurant sign 
Chipotle&apos;s menu consists of five items: burritos , fajita burritos, burrito bowls, tacos , and salads, with a choice of chicken, pork carnitas , barbacoa , steak, or vegetarian (with guacamole ). The price of the items is based on the type of meat chosen. Additional toppings include rice, beans, four types of salsa , sour cream, cheese, or lettuce. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] When asked about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, &quot;[I]t&apos;s important to keep the menu focused, because if you just do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else.&quot; [ 46 ] The majority of food is prepared in each restaurant, with some exceptions being the beans and carnitas, which are prepared at a central kitchen in Chicago, Illinois . [ 7 ] None of the restaurants have freezers , microwave ovens , or can openers . [ 47 ] Most restaurants sell beer and margaritas in addition to soft drinks and fruit drinks. [ 48 ] Quesadillas are made on request, though they are not listed on the menu. [ 49 ] In May 2010, [ dated info ] Chipotle was in the process of testing a children&apos;s menu, [ 50 ] and experimenting with breakfast foods at Washington Dulles International Airport .&quot; [ 51 ] Select restaurants are also offering a pozole soup. [ 52 ] 
 Chicken Burrito Bowl 
Chipotle accepts fax orders, and in 2005 the company added the ability to order online from their website. For both online and fax orders, customers proceed to the front of the line to pay for pre-ordered food. [ 53 ] In 2009, Chipotle released an app for the iPhone that allows users to find nearby Chipotle locations, place an order, and prepay with a credit card. [ 54 ] 

 Nutrition 

In 2003, a Center for Science in the Public Interest report stated that Chipotle&apos;s burritos contain over 1,000 calories, which is nearly equivalent to two meals&apos; worth of food. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] MSNBC Health.com placed the burritos on their list of the &quot;20 Worst Foods in America&quot; because of their high caloric content and high sodium. [ 57 ] When a burrito with carnitas, rice, vegetables, cheese, guacamole, and salsa was compared with a typical Big Mac , the burrito had more fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, and sodium than the Big Mac, but it also had more protein and fiber. [ 58 ] The restaurant has also received praise – Health.com included the restaurant in its list of the &quot;Healthiest Fast Food Restaurants&quot;. [ 59 ] 

Chipotle&apos;s vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese. [ 60 ] All items other than the meats, pinto beans, cheese, sour cream, and honey vinaigrette dressing are vegan . [ 60 ] The cheese is processed with vegetable-based rennet in order to be suitable for vegetarians. [ 60 ] In April 2010, Chipotle began testing a vegan &quot;Garden Blend&quot; option, which is a plant-based meat alternative marinated in chipotle adobo , at six locations in the U.S. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The flour tortillas used for the burritos and soft tacos are the only items that contain gluten. [ 60 ] 

In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio , where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant. [ 63 ] 

 Food sourcing 

In 1999, while looking for ways to improve the taste of the carnitas, [ 8 ] Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) . [ 64 ] Ells found the CAFOs &quot;horrific&quot;, and began sourcing from open-range pork suppliers. This caused an increase in the price, and also the sales of the carnitas burritos. [ 37 ] 

In 2001, Chipotle released a mission statement called Food With Integrity , which highlighted Chipotle&apos;s efforts to increase their use of naturally raised meat, organic produce , and dairy without added hormones . [ 3 ] Almost all of meat served in Chipotle restaurants is naturally raised, defined by the company as &quot;coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsibly—that is, in accordance with our animal welfare standards.&quot; While Chipotle targets using only naturally raised chicken, beef, and pork in its restaurants, supply chain issues occasionally cause restaurants to switch to conventionally raised meat. [ 65 ] Chipotle only uses the leg and thigh meat from its chickens, with the breast meat being sold to Panera Bread . [ 66 ] Approximately 40% of the beans are organically grown, [ 67 ] and in 2011 approximately 5% of the beans will come from conservation tilling methods. [ 68 ] In 2009, Chipotle planned to serve over 60 million pounds (27 million kilograms) of naturally raised meat, more than any other restaurant company, [ 69 ] and planned to use 75 million pounds in 2010. [ 70 ] The company pledges to use more local produce when possible, [ 71 ] [ 72 ] using &quot;35 percent of at least one of its produce items for every restaurant sourced from small and midsize local farms throughout the growing season&quot; in 2009, [ 3 ] and increasing to 50% in 2010. [ 73 ] Chipotle advertises its support of family farms, such as Niman Ranch , a California &quot;natural&quot; meat producer that contracts with farms in the Midwest to raise pork and other livestock. [ 74 ] All of the cheese and sour cream comes from cows that do not receive recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), and 30% of the dairy comes from open pasture cows. [ 75 ] Founder Steve Ells has testified before Congress in support of the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which aims to reduce the amount of antibiotics given to farm animals. [ 37 ] [ 76 ] 

Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct. [ 77 ] In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.” [ 78 ] In September 2009, Chipotle announced that it would sidestep partnership with the CIW and instead work directly with East Coast Growers and Packers to increase wages for its tomato pickers. [ 79 ] CEO Steve Ells has framed the dispute as a fundamental issue of control, stating that, “the CIW wants us to sign a contract that would let them control Chipotle&apos;s decisions regarding food in the future.&quot; [ 80 ] As of 2012, the CIW considers the dispute unresolved. [ 81 ] 

 Advertising and publicity 
 People line up outside a Chipotle in East Lansing, Michigan during a &quot;Free Burrito Day&quot; 
In the past, Chipotle mainly relied on billboards, radio ads, and word-of-mouth to advertise. [ 20 ] However, in 2012, Chipotle aired its first nationally televised commercial during the 54th Grammy Awards ceremony. [ 82 ] In 2010, the company initiated an ad campaign that mocks advice given to Chipotle by advertising agencies. [ 83 ] Chipotle has run many promotions giving out free food to potential customers, especially when opening a new store. Stores also give out free burritos on certain holidays; for instance, on Halloween , some locations have had promotions in which free burritos are given to people who come dressed as a burrito. Chipotle gave away free burritos to reporters during the 1997 trial of Timothy McVeigh , which took place in Chipotle&apos;s hometown of Denver. [ 84 ] In addition, stores offered free burritos to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina . [ 85 ] Chipotle received attention when Ozzy Osbourne &apos;s reality show The Osbournes featured the company&apos;s burritos heavily. [ 14 ] Chipotle was also mentioned throughout the &quot; Dead Celebrities &quot; episode of the television series South Park . [ 86 ] For Halloween 2010, Chipotle announced that customers dressed as a processed food product would receive a burrito for $2. The event was part of a $1 million fundraiser for Jamie Oliver&apos;s Food Revolution called &quot;Boorito 2010: The Horrors of Processed Food.&quot; [ 87 ] For &quot;Boorito 2011&quot;, customers dressed in costumes &quot;inspired by family farms&quot; will receive a menu item for $2, with proceeds from the promotion going to The Chipotle Cultivate Foundation and Farm Aid. The promotion is aimed to increase awareness of family farms. [ 88 ] Also in support of family farms, Chipotle released music videos of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Willie Nelson . [ 89 ] 

In 2011, Chipotle created the &quot;Farm Team&quot;, which is a rewards program available only by invitation from restaurant managers. The Farm Team members have access to a special Chipotle website, where members can earn rewards, i.e. free food and T-shirts. The site offers members to, &quot;learn where Chipotle’s food comes from, take quizzes and polls, play games and watch videos about the company.&quot; [ 90 ] 

Founder Steve Ells was a judge for the NBC reality television series, America&apos;s Next Great Restaurant ; Chipotle offered a buy one get one free deal in conjunction with the show. [ 91 ] The show featured an episode where contestants worked in a Chipotle restaurant for a day. [ 92 ] 

Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Cervélo (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream and Team Garmin-Transitions) of the International Cycling Union , [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and is an official team partner of the Boston Celtics , [ 95 ] and the Boston Bruins . [ 96 ] In June 2009, Chipotle sponsored free screenings of Food, Inc. , a film that criticizes the corporate food industry. Founder Steve Ells stated that he hoped the film would make customers appreciate Chipotle&apos;s Food With Integrity policy. [ 97 ] From May until September 2009, Chipotle ran a contest on mychipotle.com , a microsite which had a competition for the best user-created audio and video presentations about different combinations of ingredients. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] In July 2010, Chipotle began a campaign to support healthier lunch alternatives for students, in which money will be donated to The Lunch Box program based on how many spam E-mails consumers forward to a company E-mail address. [ 100 ] For Chipotle&apos;s 18 year anniversary, the company began wrapping its burritos in gold foil as part of a larger promotion to draw attention to its Food With Integrity mantra. [ 101 ] Also as part of the gold foil campaign, Chipotle is offering prizes for customer-created pictures of items wrapped in gold foil. Chipotle hired comedienne Amy Sedaris to create a comedic how-to video on wrapping with gold foil, and spread the video using Twitter . [ 102 ] 

 Architecture 
 The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina 
Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique. [ 8 ] [ 103 ] The interiors have been described as having an &quot;industrial, sheet metal look&quot;. [ 104 ] Chipotle has built restaurants using white ceramic tile instead of stainless steel, citing the relative ease of recycling white tile compared to steel. [ 105 ] It costs the company approximately $850,000 to open a new restaurant. [ 106 ] When the first Chipotle opened, Steve Ells asked his friend, sculptor Bruce Gueswel, to design the chairs and a styled Mayan king for the restaurant. Both items were made from wood and metal. Gueswel has continued to design and build the art and chairs for all subsequent Chipotle restaurants. [ 107 ] All Chipotle locations display a picture of the original restaurant, [ 108 ] which is near the University of Denver campus on Evans Avenue. [ 8 ] In 2010, Chipotle began opening &quot;A Model&quot; restaurants, which are smaller concept locations, citing the lower costs of development and occupancy. [ 109 ] Chipotle uses environmentally friendly packaging, with bowls made from recycled newsprint, unbleached tray liners, and napkins and cups made from postconsumer waste. [ 110 ] 

Chipotle&apos;s architectural design team incorporates the principles of sustainable architecture in their projects. The &quot;green&quot; restaurant in Gurnee, Illinois features an on-site six kilowatt wind turbine, which generates about 10% of the restaurant&apos;s electrical needs. The Gurnee restaurant has received Platinum level LEED certification from U.S. Green Building Council . [ 111 ] A restaurant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, uses recycled drywall, low-VOC paint, and energy-efficient appliances. [ 112 ] A Chipotle restaurant in Austin, Texas was the first to receive a four-star rating from the city&apos;s Green Building Program. [ 113 ] Additionally, Chipotle has made arrangements to add solar panels to 75 of its restaurants. [ 111 ] Chipotle has contracted to clean its stores in New York City, NY and Long Island , with &quot;plant-based, environmentally preferable cleaning supplies and technologies.&quot; The cleansers are readily biodegradable and non-toxic to humans or aquatic life. [ 114 ] 

Chipotle has been sued for failure to be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant, as a customer who uses a wheelchair was unable to see the food preparation, denying him the &quot;Chipotle Experience&quot;. The case against the company was upheld in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , [ 115 ] and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Chipotle&apos;s appeal, leaving the 9th&apos;s Circuit ruling intact. [ 116 ] Chipotle has, &quot;an official disability policy of bringing ingredients to the tables of diners with disabilities and doing tableside preparation.&quot; The plaintiff in the case has a history of filing ADA-related lawsuits, [ 115 ] and has sued over 20 restaurants. [ 117 ] Chipotle is retrofitting restaurants affected by the ruling, and incorporating the new design into new restaurants. [ 115 ]
