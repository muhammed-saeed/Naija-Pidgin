 Oatmeal review: Starbucks vs. Jamba Juice 

January 17th, 2009, 5:26 am· ·posted by Nancy Luna, Staff Writer 
 
 With Jamba Juice launching oatmeal in 600 stores this week, I decided to compare the smoothie chain’s oatmeal to the hot grub served at Starbucks .

 The setup: Starbucks serves instant oatmeal, while Jamba Juice delivers a slow-cooked oatmeal made from organic steel-cut oats. Each chain offers different toppings. Jamba advertises“fresh”fruit toppings, while Starbucks gives customers three packets of nuts, dried fruit and brown sugar.

Given the above information, you’d think Jamba Juice might score more points with oatmeal fans, right? I did too. But, you’ll be surprised at what I discovered.

 
 
Not very full, huh? (click on any image to enlarge)
 
 First up–Starbucks : I went to Starbucks first simply out of necessity because I wanted a cup of coffee. Instant advantage—Starbucks. If you want coffee with your oatmeal, Starbucks is the clear favorite because Jamba Juice doesn’t sell coffee. Also, if you’re counting pennies these days, Starbucks’oatmeal is 50 cents less than Jamba Juice’s oatmeal, which costs $2.95.

 Presentation: As noted earlier, Starbucks oatmeal is instant. So, it took only a few minutes to serve. When I opened the lid, I noticed the container was a little more than half-way full of oatmeal. It definitely measured to at least a cup. But, from a marketing and financial perspective, this didn’t look good. I felt gypped. Plus, its wasteful. Why not use a smaller container?
 
I expected the Starbucks oatmeal to look like this promo shot.
 
 Taste: Since Jamba Juice and Starbucks offer completely different toppings, I decided to eat each oatmeal without toppings for my first few bites.  Some of the Starbucks oatmeal didn’t seem fully cooked as I noticed a few dry flakes clinging to the side of the container. I took a few bites and it tasted OK. Let’s face it—plain oatmeal is not very exciting.  The oatmeal came alive after I drizzled it with dried fruit (a variety pack of raisins) and brown sugar. (Starbucks also offers nuts, but I opted to stick with the sweet toppings.)

 Next up, Jamba Juice 

 Presentation: Jamba Juice claims that its oatmeal comes with a choice of“three real fruit toppings”—blueberry-blackberry, apple cinnamon or fresh bananas. I ordered mine with the blueberry-blackberry. Big mistake. I thought I would be getting oatmeal drizzled with fresh fruit. Instead, I got a big blob of jelly with a brown sugar crumble on top of the oatmeal. It was awful. It was like eating blueberry pie without the crust. I had to dig through a one-inch layer of fruit filling to get to the oatmeal.
 
After excavating through the jelly blob, I found some real good oatmeal.
 
 Taste: When I finally reached the plain oats, they looked beautiful. You could tell right away it was a higher quality oatmeal—slow-cooked to perfection. On its own, it tasted good. But, I still needed a sugar boost, so I tried it with the jelly.  I didn’t like it.  The jam overpowered the cereal. All I wanted was brown sugar.  (Note: You can order the oatmeal with the brown-sugar crumble only, so next time I might do that.)

 Conclusion: Honestly. I entered this taste test thinking I’d like Jamba Juice’s oatmeal better. But, overall, I preferred Starbucks. Even though I think I got less oatmeal at Starbucks, I would recommend it for three reasons: the toppings and price are better and Starbucks is more convenient for anyone wanting a cup of Joe with their oatmeal.
 

 Tell us: Have you tasted any the oatmeals served at these chains? What do you think? Am I crazy for not liking the jelly topping? Write in and let us know.

( More than a week after this post ran, the folks at Serious Eats posted  the results of their own Oatmeal Challenge. More fast-food chains are included. It’s worth a look. )
