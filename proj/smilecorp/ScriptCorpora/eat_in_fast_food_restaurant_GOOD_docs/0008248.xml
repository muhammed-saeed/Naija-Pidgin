Problem with Air Bags

 Jun 15, 2012 - Senoia, GA - Air Bags 
THE AIRBAG LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON. I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE FOR REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND THEN THE LIGHT WAS OFF. I&apos;VE HAD THE CAR NOW FOR 10 YEARS THIS DECEMBER. I CAN&apos;T RECALL A TIME MY AIRBAG LIGHT HAS NOT BEEN ON. JUST RECENTLY I STARTED RESEARCHING AND FOUND THEIR IS A SHORT WIRE UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT AND IT HAS A LITTLE GRAY PRONG ON IT. THE GRAY PRONG NEEDS TO BE GROUNDED AND IT SHOULD BE ATTACHED THE BARS THE SEAT SLIDES BACK AND FORTH ON. I STUCK THE GRAY PLUG IN AND THE AIRBAG LIGHT WENT OUT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS EVERY TIME YOU MOVE THE SEAT IT PUSHES THE GRAY PLUG DOWN AND EVENTUALLY IT WILL COME BACK ON AND I WILL HAVE TO FIX IT AGAIN. FORD NEEDS TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS AN EASY FIX AND I DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DON&apos;T CHANGE THE PLUG OR MAKE A LONGER CORD. FORD NEEDS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I LOVE MY CAR BUT HATE THE FRUSTRATION.

I PURCHASED MY ESCAPE IN 2004, WITH 15,000. MILES. SHORTLY AFTER THAT I RECEIVED AN NOTICED THAT IT HAD BEEN RECALLED FOR SOMETHING WITH THE SAFETY BELT WHICH THEY REPLACED/REPAIRED FRR OF CHARGE. NOW THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AND THE DEALER TOLD ME IT WAS SOME TYPE OF SENOR, AND IT WOULD COST ABOUT 250.00 TO FIX. NOW THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS OFF BUT THE CHIME REMAINS. I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING THAT THIS ISSUE ONE OF SAFETY, AND IT ISN&apos;T THE FIRST COMPLAINT. WHEN WILL FORD GET OFF THEIR CORPORATE BEHIND AND GET THIS FIXED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED?

IN MARCH 2004 WHILE DRIVING AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED, I CLIPPED THE CORNER OF A PARKED VEHICLE WHICH CAUSED MY FORD ESCAPE TO OVERTURN. NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. IN SEPTEMBER 2009 WHILE ENTERING A FREEWAY DURING A HEAVY RAINSTORM, DRIVING AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED, THE ESCAPE HYDRO PLANED, SLAMMED INTO THE CEMENT BARRIER RENDERING THE VEHICLE USELESS. DESPITE THE VEHICLE HAVING SPUN MULTIPLE TIMES AND BEING SLAMMED INTO THE BARRIER AT SUCH AN IMPACT THE TRANSMISSION DROPPED SEVERAL INCHES, NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW FROM BUTTERFIELD FORD IN SALT LAKE, AT A COST OF $22, 200. IN THE 5+ YEARS OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE, I SPENT MORE THAN $10,000 IN REPAIRS - FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE. DESPITE MY PLEAS TO THE DEALER SHIP, I WAS NEVER PROVIDED ANY REMEDY. DESPITE A DPF SENSOR GOING OUT 3 TIMES AND ONLY BEING COVERED ONCE BY WARRANTY, CALIPERS GOING OUT AND THEN BRAKES SHORTLY AFTER THE VEHICLES WARRANTY EXPIRES WHICH FORD WILL NOT COVER DESPITE THE CALIPERS HAVING JUST BEEN REPLACED. THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD, THE LATCH TO THE TAIL GATE DID NOT WORK. THIS VEHICLE WAS A LEMON AND FORD NEVER EVEN TRIED TO PROVIDE A REMEDY. MY PRIMARY CONCERN, THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY DESPITE THE VEHICLE TURNING OVER DURING THE FIRST ACCIDENT NOR WHEN I HIT A CEMENT BARRIER WITH SUCH FORCE THE TRANSMISSION DROPPED SEVERAL INCHES.

MY AIRBAG LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON EVERY TIME I START MY FORD ESCAPE. UPON REVIEW OF THIS IT&apos;S BEEN ON COMPLAINT WEBSITES SEVERAL TIMES BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE NEED TO DIE DUE TO MALFUNCTION OF THE AIR BAGS BEFORE WE HAVE A RECALL. THIS LIGHT HAS BEEN ON SINCE I&apos;VE OWNED THE VEHICLE. ALSO MY WINDOW STOPPED GOING UP. THE DIPSTICK CAN&apos;T GIVE A CLEAR READING OF THE OIL AMOUNT. THESE THINGS LEAD TO DEATH, CONSTANT AND COSTLY REPAIR, AND CONSTANT PROBLEMS.

MY 2002 FORD ESCAPE WAS BOUGHT NEW IN MARCH OF 2002. THE PROBLEM WITH IT ACCELERATING AT LOW SPEEDS STARTED ABOUT 6-7 MONTHS LATER. RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP MANY TIMES TO HAVE IT CHECKED BUT WAS TOLD EVERY TIME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. I&apos;VE HAD ONE ACCIDENT AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM. I STILL OWN THE SAME ESCAPE AND STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH IT . I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE WITH THESE MODELS BUT HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY. I ALSO AS HAVE MANY PEOPLE HAD THE PROBLEM WITH THE AIR-BAG LIGHT ON .AGAIN MANY TRIPS TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG ABOUT $300 LATER FOR LABOR COSTS. FINALLY ON ONE MORE ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG I RETURNED TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT A SENSOR IN THE SEAT-BELT WAS THE PROBLEM AND IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $300-$400 TO REPAIR IT AND THAT THE AIR BAGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE WORKING BECAUSE OF THIS SENSOR. I HAVE PERSONALLY LOST ALL FAITH IN FORD CANADA AND THEIR PRODUCTS AND SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES AT THE DEALERSHIPS I&apos;VE DEALT WITH. I AM IN THE PROCESS I BUYING A NEW CAR BUT IT&apos;S NOT A FORD. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A FORD

MY WIFE&apos;S 02 FORD ESCAPE (WITH LESS THAN 50K MILES) JUST HAD ONE OF THE GAS TANK STRAPS BREAK DUE TO CORROSION. MAJOR FIRE/SAFETY HAZARD IF THE GAS TANK HITS THE GROUND. VERY SIMILAR ISSUE KNOWN WITH F150. THE DEALER IS CHARGING US $1K TO FIX!!! THIS SAME CAR IS ALSO IN THE SHOP EVERY OTHER MONTH FOR A FAULTY AIRBAG SWITCH/RELAY THAT WE&apos;VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX. THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY MAKES ME SICK! WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR THESE GUYS TO DO THE RIGHT THING? IT BLOWS MY MIND.

I HAVE A 2002 FORD ESCAPE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE AIR BAG LIGHT. THE AIR BAG LIGHT BEGAN BLINKING THEN IT WOULD STAY ON. I BELIEVE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIDE AIR BAG CONNECTORS UNDER THE DRIVER SEAT. I HAVE TRIED CLEANING THEM WITH CONTACT CLEANER. THE LIGHT WILL GO OFF BUT WILL COME BACK ON SOMETIME LATER. THE LIGHT COMES ON EVERY TIME I START THE ENGINE OR JUST HAVE IN THE +ON+ POSITION. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!

MY 2002 FORD ESCAPE IS EXPERIENCING ITS SECOND MAJOR AIRBAG PROBLEM. THE WIRING UNDER THE SEAT HAS NOW &quot;BURNT UP&quot; FOR THE SECOND TIME AND I CAN&apos;T AFFORD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED AGAIN TO THE TUNE OF $450 SO I DRIVE WITHOUT ACTIVE AIRBAGS. THE WIRING HAS BEEN REPLACED ONCE ALREADY JUST 4 MONTHS AGO BUT I LIVE IN A DIFFERENT STATE THAN I DID 4 MONTHS AGO SO I&apos;M STUCK. IN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM ONLINE I SEE THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM. SHOULDN&apos;T THERE BE A RECALL WHEN IT INVOLVES A SAFETY ISSUE LIKE THIS?

I PURCHASED MY 2002 FORD ESCAPE IN FEBRUARY 2006. WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON. I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT THE SEATBELT PRETENSER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, BUT I CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY ALMOST $500. THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THAT BECAUSE I CAN&apos;T HAVE IT FIXED, MY AIRBAGS MAY NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO THE FORD COMPANY AND GOT NO HELP. SO, BASICALLY THEY ARE SAYING THAT I DESERVE TO BE HURT OR KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I CAN&apos;T AFFORD TO HAVE THE PRETENSER FIXED. I FOR ONE DO NOT THINK THAT IS FAIR.

LOCAL REPAIR SHOP SAID ONLY DEALER COULD HANDLE THIS. DEALER QUOTED PRICE TO JUST INVESTIGATE. AND THAT IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT THEY FOUND IF THE QUOTE WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE TOTAL REPAIR COST. HMMM. DEALER ALSO SAID THAT MOST LIKELY WHILE THE WARNING LIGHT IS ON THAT THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A COLLISION. I HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS HERE AT THIS WEBSITE AND ELSEWHERE AND MERELY WANT TO ADD MINE TO THE GROWING LIST. THE MORE WE COMPLAIN MAYBE WE&apos;LL GET SOME RESULTS. THANKS.

AIR BAG LIGHT ILLUMINATED CONTINUOUSLY INDICATING THAT THE AIR BAGS MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY IN A COLLISION. FORD DEALER PERFORMED AIR BAG SELF TEST AND CODE B1881 WAS OBTAINED. I HAD TO HAVE WIRING REVISIONS TO BOTH SEATS AT A COST OF $292.86. THE DEALER REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT THE WIRING REVISION WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL WIRING UNDER THE SEATS WAS INCAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING THE FULL RANGE OF NORMAL SEAT ADJUSTMENTS ALLOWED BY THE ELECTRIC SEAT ADJUSTOR. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT INVOLVING A SAFETY FEATURE OF THE 2002 FORD ESCAPE . SHOULD NOT THE MANUFACTURER HAVE TO PAY FOR CORRECTING THIS SAFETY DEFECT?

IT WORRIES ME BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW IF THE AIRBAGS WILL WORK DURING AN ACCIDENT.

MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS OPERATING MY 2002 FORD XLT ESCAPE AND WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT RECENTLY IN AUGUST 2007. AN INDIVIDUAL RAN A STOP SIGN AND SHE HIT HIS VEHICLE BROADSIDE AT 50 MILES PER HOUR. THE AUTOMOBILE HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS TOTALED AT 10K PLUS DAMAGE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT NONE OF HER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED IN THE VEHICLE. SHE WAS WEARING A SEAT BELT BUT RECEIVED INJURES INCLUDING A PARTIALLY COLLAPSED LUNG, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN A DIRECT RESULT OF THE AIRBAGS NOT STOPPING HER FORWARD MOTION.

IN APRIL 2007, I TOOK MY 2002 FORD ESCAPE BECAUSE OF CONSTANT CLICKING NOISE THAT I HEARD COMING FROM THE LEFT FRONT SIDE OF THE CAR FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS MY SWAY BAR END LINK, BUT THE RIGHT SIDE. THE LEFT END LINK HAD BEEN REPLACED IN APRIL 2006, SO I HAD TO PAY FOR THE RIGHT END LINK TO BE REPLACED. THE CLICKING NOISE PERSISTS. NOW, THE DEALER IS SAYING THAT IT IS THE RIGHT LOWER CONTROL ARM THAT IS MAKING THE NOISE AND I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO IT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE SAME NOISE AND STARTED ONLY 2 DAYS AFTER BEING SERVICED. ALSO, THE CAR HAS STALLED TWICE. THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE AND NEEDS A THIRD REPLACEMENT. THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REPLACED. THE AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON INTERMITTENTLY AND REMAINS ON FOR MONTHS AT A TIME; STARTED IN 2004. THE WINDOWS AND DOOR LOCKS HAVE BEEN SERVICED FOR INTERMITTENTLY NOT WORKING THREE TIMES BEFORE THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED.

I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE AT A SHOPPING CENTER. AS I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR PREPARING TO STOP, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LUNGED FORWARD, HOPPING THE CURB AND CONTINUING FORWARD INTO THE PATIO AREA. I APPLIED THE BRAKES, BUT THE CAR DID NOT STOP. IT HIT A TRASH CAN AND TABLES AND FINALLY CRASHED INTO A PILLAR. IN APPLYING THE BRAKE, I HAD MANAGED TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN SO THE IMPACT WAS NOT SEVERE AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I WAS NOT INJURED BUT TWO PEOPLE LUNCHING IN THE PATIO AREA RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES (A SCRATCHED/SWOLLEN LEG AND SORE ELBOW). THE VEHICLE HAS SINCE BEEN REPAIRED AND THE CAUSE OF ACCIDENT IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. SINCE I AM PARANOID ABOUT DRIVING THE VEHICLE, I AM PLANNING TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC TEST CONDUCTED.

ON 9/27/02 I WAS INVOLVED IN A COLLISION WHERE I RAN A STOP SIGN AND &quot;T-BONED&quot; A PASSING CAR THAT WAS TRAVELING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. MY 2002 ESCAPE WAS TOTALED - THE FRONT END COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. EVERY OFFICER, PARAMEDIC, AND FIREMAN WAS AMAZED THAT THE AIR BAG FAILED TO DEPLOY. THEY ALL INSTRUCTED ME TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER REGARDING THIS MATTER. AS THIS IS MY SECOND ESCAPE (THE FIRST ONE SUCKED A VALVE WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF OWNERSHIP), I WILL NO LONGER TRUST FORD TO PROVIDE A SAFE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR MYSELF OR MY FAMILY MEMBERS.
