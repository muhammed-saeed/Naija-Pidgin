It all started way back in 1998 when Dinemore opened it’s first restaurant in Dharmapala Mawatha – Colombo. With humble beginnings, a workforce of seven initially served to a capacity of 80 customers.
Even though International fast food giants were operating franchises in Colombo, Dinemore beat them all in numbers as well as the quality offered with it’s unique proposition “ So much for so little”. The restaurant captured the hearts of the Colombo fast food lovers and became a favourite dining location for many.
Eventually Dinemore was forced to expand further with more outlets in Colombo and Kandy to serve the increasing customer demand . A fast food restaurant specialized in Pizza and fried chicken recipes opened later at the popular Moors Sports Club premises in Colombo – 03.
The success of the unique recipes of Dinemore propelled it to become the first Sri Lankan origin international fast food restaurant chain. Dinemore now serves the customers in Maldivian Islands with three outles in Male. Further outlets in different geographical locations will be set up soon making Dinemore a Global Fast food restaurant chain.
While serving the best food for it’s customers over the years, Dinemore has also been contributing for the upliftment of the community. The company provides a scholarship for talented and deserving students less affluent families in the society. Through this scholarship the students are paid a monthly payment to be used for their educational expenses, which is provided until they complete their university degree.
