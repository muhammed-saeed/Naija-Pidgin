Coupon Tips
 
 Wendy’s is a fast food burger joint. It first was opened in Ohio in 1969. They offer hamburgers and cheeseburgers any way that you want them. The concept took a while to take hold when fast food consumers are used to just ordering and eating what you get. You can still order a Burger any way that you want it along with different types of chicken sandwiches. Some other popular menu items for Wendy’s are their Frosty’s, Chili and baked potatoes. Wendy’s does offer fries as their main side dish but you can choose from other items as well.

You can sign up at Wendy’s to receive coupons with coinciding Wendy’s coupon codes. They will tell you about every Wendy’s promotion and give you printable versions of the Wendy’s promo codes. This is one easy way to get a Wendy’s discount but there is also another way. You can go to deallocker.com and receive a Wendy’s coupon code. They will list many codes but you will need to check with local restaurants to see if the internet codes are valid or if you need an actual coupon.

One thing that Wend’s does different than the other fast food burger joints is their patties. Wendy’s has a square seasoned patty that is made from 100% real ground beef. They offer two sizes of patties one for the regular sized sandwiches and one for the juniors. The square patty fills up the bun with some left over so you will not have to worry about having too much bread for your burger.
