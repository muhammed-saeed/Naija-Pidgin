Burger King Ad Fight: The Worst-Case Scenario for Crispin Porter + Bogusky
 By Jim Edwards Burger King appears to be frittering away its hard-fought sales gains and Crispin Porter + Bogusky could end up being used as the fall-guy. Ad Age reports this week that BK&apos;s corporate HQ is trying to rig a vote that will force franchisees to accept a $1 for a double burger promotion -- the restaurateurs don&apos;t want it because they can&apos;t make money on it. HQ favors the promo because sales have declined this year while McDonald&apos;s have gone up.

 To mollify the franchisees, BKHQ is promising to tone down CP+B&apos;s risque ads, which have included blow-job jokes ,* racist stuff about Mexicans (see image), and inappropriate promotions targeting kids .

But Age neglected to mention the 800-pound gorilla in the room at BK: The federal suit in which franchisees accuse BKHQ of plotting to steal $25 million of their funds in 2010 and $40 million thereafter , in a conspiracy to reinterpret a contract with Coca-Cola and divert the money to advertsing. (Sounds complicated? It is. See the link for an explanation.)

In that litigation, BKHQ won the right to file a copy of its soft drink agreement with Coke under seal. That agreement is crucial because rebates from Coke&apos;s sales to BK fund BK&apos;s advertising under an agreement with the franchisees.

BK, in response, filed a motion arguing that the fight over the ads should be heard in a different court. It has yet to substantively address the claim on the facts.
 Read documents in the Franchisees v. Burger King case here . 
On its own, that is not interesting except what it says about BKHQ&apos;s tactics: That it is going to litigate every single detail of this fight and drag it out as long as possible. With the first $25 million in jeopardy in 2010, it is foreseeable that the money will be diverted well before the legal fight is over.

 So how might all this result in a worst-case scenario for CP+B? Doubtless, if BKHQ needs to settle the suit it will put the considerations of its $65 million Coke-rebate-ad-fund ahead of its expenses for CP+B. And with franchisees pissed that the agency&apos;s ads are no longer turning around sales, you can see that one possible compromise might involve BKHQ agreeing to jettison CP+B from the account in order to save its Coke money and make peace with the restaurant owners who have come to dislike the shop&apos;s work.

 * Correction: The ad referred to was not one of CP+B&apos;s. The agency tells BNET: Burger King Corporation (BKC) values and respects all of its guests. This advertisement is running to support a limited promotion in the Singapore market and is not running in the U.S. or any other markets. It was produced by a locally-based Singapore agency and not by BKC&apos;s U.S. advertising agency of record, Crispin Porter and Bogusky.
