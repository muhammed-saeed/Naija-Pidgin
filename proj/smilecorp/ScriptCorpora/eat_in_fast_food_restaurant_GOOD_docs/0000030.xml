Vitamins‘n More adds cafe to its Rockford store
 Posted on June 13, 2011 at 4:54 pm by Melissa Westphal Tweet 
Vitamins‘n More has opened a cafe inside its store, 3618 E. State St., inside the Fairview Shopping Center.

The store, which specializes in vitamins and supplements and organic food offerings, relocated to the center near Fairview Boulevard and East State Street from the Edgebrook shopping center last year. The cafe opened in the back of the store about a week ago.

Co-owner Janet Kapotas said the response to the cafe, which has seating for about 30 people, has been great so far. The healthier menu features foods cooked with less sodium and less fat, as well as vegetarian and gluten-free items.

Some of the featured menu items include a spicy chicken and black bean wrap, a Greek salad, tuna fish and chicken salads, a couscous salad and a hummus plate. Kapotas said the cafe also has baklava and gluten-free goodies for dessert.

The cafe is open from about 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and the store is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.

Visit the store’s website or call 815-226-4605 or 815-226-3650 for more information.
