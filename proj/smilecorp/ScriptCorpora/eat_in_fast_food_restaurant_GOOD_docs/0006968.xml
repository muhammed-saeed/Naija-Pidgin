How I miss Cafe de Coral. They are a fast food chain in Hong Kong and their food selection changes often and the price and varieties are great. I love their Bake Pork Chop dish and the baked pasta in bolognese sauce. And a set lunch price is around US$4. They also have afternoon tea, breakfast and dinner. Something from... More

We really were impressed how fast and fresh the meals were served. Compared to MC Donalds this self serve Restaurant is just as good as a 3 star restaurant. Their menu changes from breakfast over lunch to dinner. We saved a lot of time and money while eating there. Chinese affordable fast food, freshly prepared, served hot, nice interior.

It is famous for local fast foods but I must say quality is deteriorating and the price keeps silently going up.

If you want to get the idea of how normal Hong Kong workers eat, that&apos;s where you will go. The food is really international with hotpots to french toast but it&apos;s really not taste so good but give it a shot if you JUST want to get the Hong Kong style life in your&apos;&apos;relaxing&apos;&apos;holiday.
