ARCO Debit Card: Transaction Fee Free Gas

 An Independent Reward Card Review 

 November 13, 2010 Update: ARCO is no longer offering the ARCO Debit card.

A note on their web site, arcodebit.com , reads:
 At this time, we are not accepting new requests for this card or providing...replacement cards for this program. 
If you don&apos;t have an ARCO Debit card already, bring cash when you visit ARCO or pay the price: 45 cents to use a credit or debit card.

If you have questions about your account, call them at 1-800-959-3349.

There are still two options for avoiding the transaction fee at ARCO when paying by card at the pump:

 Prepaid cards: ARCO sells gift cards in $5 to $100 dominations. This isn&apos;t very practical because, quite often, you won&apos;t be able to fill your tank when the money runs out on the card. Business fleet cards: If you own a business, you can apply for a fleet credit card. 
 Now, back to the review... 


 

If the allure of credit card convenience for cheap ARCO gas is strong, this card may be for you. In most other respects, it is a lousy card.

The ARCO Debit MasterCard does one thing well: It avoids the 45-cent convenience fee ARCO charges to use a credit card at their gas stations.

The card is free with no annual fee. If you have shunned ARCO because they don&apos;t accept credit cards, the ARCO Debit card could win you back.

Cheap gas is about all the ARCO card is good for, though.

ARCO Debit is also a reward card but the rewards are miniscule. They employ poor security practices, like sending activated cards in the mail. It is a decidedly self-service card that requires a computer to operate.

Is the ARCO Debit MasterCard right for you? What is the reward structure and what are the caveats? What other benefits does the card offer? In what ways is their fraud protection lacking?

What is the ARCO Debit Card?
 Marketing graphic courtesy of ARCO/BP Global. One of These Means No ARCO Fees 
Don&apos;t let ARCO penalize you for using a credit card. Get the free ARCO Debit MasterCard.
 A Typical ARCO Station 
Their gas is cheap, in part, because they don&apos;t take credit cards. They do accept debit cards for a fee. The ARCO card avoids that fee.
 
 ARCO is a chain of around 1,400 gas stations operating in five western states: California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon and Washington. They are famous for low-priced gas. They are also famous for not accepting credit cards.

At most stations, you can pay for gas with a debit card. However, they charge a 45-cent convenience fee for the privilege. That&apos;s where the ARCO Debit MasterCard comes in.

Just link one up to your checking account- it doesn&apos;t cost a thing- and you can avoid the 45-cent fee.

Here&apos;s a rundown of the ARCO Debit card:

 Free to sign up: There&apos;s no application fee, processing or any other fee to get started. Just have your checkbook handy when you sign up- you&apos;ll need your routing and account number. Free to use: The card has no annual fee (unless you opt for the&quot;Preferred&quot;card, which I don&apos;t recommend), no transaction fees and no surprise fees. Eliminate transaction fees at ARCO and am/pm markets: This is the best, and possibly the only, reason to get the ARCO Debit MasterCard. It&apos;s a great solution if you have avoided ARCO because they don&apos;t take credit cards. It&apos;s a debit card, not a credit card: You can use the ARCO debit card anywhere MasterCard is accepted. The money you spend is drawn directly from your checking account. Many consumer advocates advise against these types of cards because they lack protections that credit cards provide. Everyone qualifies, credit rating not affected: ARCO is not issuing you a line of credit. This means:
 As long as you have a checking account in good standing, you can get the ARCO debit card. The card has no effect on your credit score. ARCO does pull your credit report from TransUnion to make sure you&apos;re a real person and own the checking account you provide them. 
 Pathetic rewards program: ARCO debit is also a rewards card but you shouldn&apos;t use it for that reason. The best you can get back is 0.7% and that&apos;s only after spending $7,500 and paying a $25 annual fee. And here&apos;s the kicker: You aren&apos;t rewarded for fuel purchases, even at ARCO. If you&apos;re looking for a rewards card, keep looking. You can do better. Internet required: ARCO never sends you a statement or any other correspondence in the mail. You must view your transactions and rewards online. In addition, a surprising number of services are only offered online, including activating your card. 
 Photo courtesy of ARCO/BP Global. No, the Gas Isn&apos;t That Cheap 
Apparently ARCO hasn&apos;t freshened up their marketing photo in a while. $1.59 a gallon for unleaded? Those were the days.
 
 Horrendous customer service: The customer care department is ill trained and ineffective. For example, an ongoing issue has prevented me from using my ARCO card since March 1 st , 2010. After six calls and two e-mails, I&apos;m not convinced they even understand what the problem is. But they&apos;re still working on it. Fraud protection not a priority: This is the truly unfortunate and somewhat disturbing part of the ARCO Debit experience. Four things bring me to this conclusion:
 They send activated cards in the mail. This is credit card issuing 101: Wait until the customer receives the card and contacts you before activating it. Anyone could have intercepted my activated, unsigned credit card and gone on a spending spree, draining my checking account in the process. Default PIN is easily guessable. They base your initial secret code on personal information you provide. Sometimes it&apos;s your zip code, which is on the paperwork that arrives with your card. Default PIN is not easily changed. You must change your code online and it requires the Java plug-in , which you may not have easy access to. Fraud investigations are slow and one-way. Less than two months after signing up for the card, I was a victim of a fraudulent transaction. It wasn&apos;t entirely ARCO&apos;s fault. However, after my initial report, I could not follow up with their fraud department. It took over two months to complete the investigation and I was without a card during that time. 
 

 

  

Finally, Use a Credit Card at ARCO with No Convenience Fee
 Pay at the Island, Not the Pump 
No personal card readers in the pump at most ARCO stations. A 3:1 pump to pay station ratio is typical.
 
The best feature of the ARCO Debit MasterCard is the ability to pay at the pump with a card without getting dinged an extra 45 cents. Until this card&apos;s invention, you had to be a commercial driver to use a card at ARCO without fees.

Where I live, the two cheapest gas station chains are Costco and ARCO. I have always avoided ARCO because of the surcharge to use credit cards and my unwillingness to pay cash.

Steering clear of ARCO often left me&quot;running on fumes&quot;as I held out for the next time I&apos;m near Costco. There is only one Costco with a gas station within a 50-mile radius of me versus 20 ARCO stations.

I have many more choices for low-cost gas now that I have the ARCO card.

 
 
 Why Not Pay Cash for ARCO Gas?

Sure, I could pay cash for ARCO gas. But I live a cashless life where possible. By putting everything I can on a credit card, I can track my expenses more easily, get cash back on my purchases and rarely need to visit the ATM.

Plus, paying cash at a gas station requires two interactions with a cashier: First to prepay for my tank of fuel and second to get the change. Both interactions could involve a long line.

Who needs that hassle?

 

 Pay at the Island, Not at the Pump

Even though you are using a card at ARCO, you still might need to wait in line.

At most stations I&apos;ve been to, there isn&apos;t a card reader on the pump itself. The card reader is on an island in between the pumps.

You may find a line at that payment station. There is one&quot;PayQuick&quot;kiosk for every two to four pumps. It accepts cash in addition to debit cards.

It can really slow you down, especially if you get behind a guy with a bunch of crumbly one&apos;s!

The receipts also print from these payment stations. If you need one, you&apos;re back in that line again.

The system definitely has its drawbacks compared to gas stations that give you your own, personal card reader and receipt printer.

I have seen card readers in the pump at some newer and remodeled ARCO stations. Hopefully this is the new trend for ARCO stations.
 
 

  

What You Need to Sign Up
 Signing Up? Get Your Checkbook Out 
The ARCO Debit Card links to your checking account. You&apos;ll need your routing number and checking account number to sign up.
 
Signing up is free. Since it&apos;s a debit card, your credit history won&apos;t disqualify you. There are a few surprising requirements, though.

Let&apos;s go through the list:

 A checking account. ARCO Debit is not a credit card. It is linked to your checking account. Anytime you make a charge on your ARCO Debit card, the money is taken directly out of your checking account. You will need a blank check handy when you sign up- they ask for your routing and account number. An Internet-connected computer. This is a self-service card and many tasks require a computer. For example, you must log in to ARCO&apos;s web site to activate your card. You also need a computer to view your statements- they will not send them out in the mail. Find the complete list of tasks in the&quot;What is the ARCO Debit Card&quot;section. 
 System Requirements for the ARCO Card 
It reads like the specs for the latest computer gadget. It&apos;s not. This is what you need to get an ARCO card.
 
 Java runtime. Not only do you need a computer but you also need special software installed on it. You can activate your card without Java but you cannot change your easily guessable PIN that ARCO assigns. Read more about this odd requirement and see if you have Java in our&quot;Fraud Protection Shortcomings&quot;section. Your bank statement, preferably online. As part of the sign up process, OptiPay (ARCO&apos;s debit card issuer) withdraws 1 cent from and deposits 1 cent to your checking account. This ensures they can draw funds for purchases you make with your ARCO card. When you see these transactions on your statement, it will contain a six-digit code. When you activate the card online, OptiPay asks for this code. If you don&apos;t have online access to your checking account, you will have to wait until you receive your bank statement to activate your card. Willingness to deal with substandard customer service. Nearly every interaction I have had with ARCO Debit customer service ended in frustration. Read more in the section&quot;Awful Customer Experience.&quot;If all goes smoothly, you won&apos;t have to deal with them. Just be forewarned when something goes wrong, your disappointment will likely be compounded when you deal with ARCO Debit MasterCard&apos;s customer service. 

If you have everything you need, visit http://www.arcodebit.com to sign up.

 

  

A Side Benefit: Cheaper ATM Fees than Your Bank

Here&apos;s a benefit that surprised me: Your ARCO Debit MasterCard only charges 75 cents to use an ATM. Bank of America charges me $2.50 when I use a non-BofA ATM.

Whenever I need cash and my own bank isn&apos;t near by, I just whip out the ARCO card and save $1.75 on the transaction.

The money still comes out of my BofA checking account. I just pay less to access it.

Of course, it doesn&apos;t prevent the bank from which you&apos;re withdrawing money from charging you their out-of-network fee (the&quot; double-dip ,&quot;as it&apos;s known).

 

  

Buying Gas with Your ARCO Card
 Buy Gas at the&quot;PayQuick&quot;Station 
You&apos;ll find these payment kiosks between the pumps. Don&apos;t forget to note your pump number.
 
Once you activate your card and create a PIN, you&apos;re ready to get cheap gas at ARCO. Here&apos;s what you do when you pull in:

 Note your pump number. You&apos;re going to need it in step 3. Find a&quot;PayQuick&quot;kiosk. They are usually in-between the pumps. Enter the pump number. Insert card and enter PIN. Pump your gas. Need a receipt? Back to the PayQuick kiosk. Enter the pump number and select&quot;Print Receipt.&quot; 

 

  

Redeeming Your ARCO Debit Card Rewards

You can claim the rewards you earn in one of three ways. Only one method is free if you want to spend the rewards. You can only redeem rewards in $5 increments.

The three options are: Use a debit transaction (possibly free), transfer to your checking account ($1.99) or donate your rewards (free). Let&apos;s go through each.

 
 
 The Free Way to Cash In Your Rewards

Every time you earn $5 in rewards, it is transferred to your&quot;Rewards Account.&quot;You can spend money in your rewards account by entering a special PIN when you use your ARCO card as a debit card.

Just go somewhere and swipe your ARCO Debit MasterCard. If the machine asks you&quot;Debit or Credit,&quot;choose debit. Now enter your PIN followed by the number 3. For example, if your secret code is 1234, enter 12343.

Whatever you spend at the retailer will come out of your rewards account, rather than your checking account.

You may have noticed a couple of&quot;gotchas&quot;in this scenario:

 You might have to split up your purchase into two transactions. If you only have $5 in your rewards account, but you&apos;re spending $20, you will have to find a way to cover the extra $15. If you&apos;re pumping gas at ARCO, this means pumping $5 from your rewards account, then coming back and pumping the rest with your checking account via your ARCO card. You might get hit with a transaction fee. Many, if not most, retailers charge you a fee for using a debit card. Always ask the cashier what the policy is for using a debit card. Grocery stores typically don&apos;t charge for using a debit card. ARCO and am/pm won&apos;t charge a fee (as long as you&apos;re using the ARCO card). 

 

 The $1.99 Way to Cash In Your Rewards

ARCO allows you to transfer rewards to your linked checking account. Just log in at arcodebit.com and select Transfer Rewards. Your rewards appear in your checking account in a couple of days, minus a $1.99 fee for the transfer.

 

 Donate Your Rewards Free

The final option for depleting your earned rewards is to donate them to one of ARCOs handpicked environmental charities. They do not charge you to donate the rewards.

Here are the companies you can donate to:

 Earthwatch Institute The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute The Climate Group 
 
 

  

Rewards Program Not Very Rewarding, May Even Penalize

ARCO debit offers a multi-tier rewards program. The more you spend, the more you get back. The problem is you just don&apos;t get very much back. If you&apos;re looking for a reward card, look elsewhere.
