 Behind the Scenes of a McDonald’s Photo Shoot 
 Posted by Alex in Advertising , Food&amp;Drink , Video Clips on June 20, 2012 at 5:00 pm 


 

Why do food bought from McDonald&apos;s look nothing like the ones on their 
 ads? Usually, this is where we cue the outrage from blogs about the difference between fast 
 food ads and reality , but not this time.

This time, McDonald&apos;s Canada Director of Marketing Hope Bagozzi explains 
 what&apos;s going on behind the scenes of a McDonald&apos;s photo shoot: Hit play

Is the honesty refreshing or does it just make you hungry for a Big Mac?

 Secret of Making McDonald’s French Fries Revealed 
 Posted by Alex in Food&amp;Drink on April 26, 2012 at 7:00 pm 


 Love 
 McDonald&apos;s Frency fries and wish you could make some at home? Chef David 
 Myers of Comme Ca restaurant 
 in Los Angeles has cracked the secret:
 
 [David Myers] says the key to making a perfect, consistent, McDonald&apos;s-style 
 fry is in the advance preparation. The cut potatoes need to be soaked 
 for at least two hours before cooking which pulls out excess starch 
 and ensures the crispiest product. Also, Myers recommends that,&quot;you 
 have plenty of paper towels, a lined sheet pan, and have your oil ready 
 to go.&quot;

 Cow Walks Up to McDonald’s Drive Through Window

Darcy the cow of Brush, Colorado was in a cannibalistic mood (we all get that way sometimes, right?), so she hopped the fence and hoofed it half a mile to a McDonald’s. She walked up to the drive through window, to the amusement of the workers. Police informed the owners, who brought her back home.

 Love with a Side of Fries 
 Posted by Alex in Video Clips on March 28, 2012 at 11:54 am 



 

Fifty years ago, then 16-year-old Steve Rydberg was working at a local
McDonald’s. Since he worked at the grill, his co-workers developed a code
to let him know whenever a cute girl walked in the restaurant.

Here’s a wonderful story of how Steve met his true love back then and
how he surprised his wife on her birthday fifty years later at the same
McDonald’s:
 
 …back by the grill, Steve and his coworkers had a problem. How
were they to know when a pretty girl was approaching the counter? Their
solution: a code that could be passed between the boys working the counter
and the boys manning the grill in the back. They chose the number&quot;13&quot;
as the tip off, followed by the register number where the young lass
was ordering. 

 &quot;’13 on six, 13 on five,’and we mixed it in, like,‘I need
12 burgers on a 13 on two,’&quot;laughed Steve. 

 Then, one day, in walked 16-year-old Kristine Hess, Steve’s perfect
13.&quot;I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;

 Real Life Hamburglar On The Loose In Maine 
 Posted by Zeon Santos in Crime&amp;Law , Food&amp;Drink , Living , Society&amp;Culture on March 27, 2012 at 6:19 pm 

 

A real life Hamburglar is running around stealing burgers in Augusta, Maine and no Big Mac is safe. Here’s the scoop:
 
According to Lt. Christopher Massey of the Augusta Police, a young man wearing red jeans reportedly grabbed the goods as they were being handed to a customer by an employee.

Massey tracked the alleged thief down to a nearby Arby’s parking lot, but he managed to escape into the woods with the loot.

The restaurant prepared a new meal for the victims and told Massey that this sort of thing “does happen occasionally.”
 
Now that’s what I call hard up for a hamburger!

 Fast Food Flavors You Won’t Find In The US 
 Posted by Jill Harness in Features , Food&amp;Drink , Neatorama Exclusives , Travel on January 5, 2012 at 5:16 am 

I recently posted an article about discontinued snack foods , and many of our readers pointed out that some of the foods were still available in other countries. As it turns out, fast food companies operate in a similar manner, offering local favorites to other countries that they would never consider selling in America. Here are a few American fast food establishments and the dishes they don’t offer in America.

Burger King

 

In Canada, poutine, fries covered in cheese curds and gravy, is offered at almost every fast food restaurant, but BK offers their own varieties that fit in with the rest of their food –most notably, the Angry Poutine with fried onions and peppers on top.

In Puerto Rico, mallorcas, sweet pastry buns, are a popular breakfast treat and Burger King takes full advantage of the popularity of these buns by offering the King Mallorca, filled with ham, eggs and three different cheeses. If you want something even more filling, you might want to try their Enormous Omelet, which isn’t an omelet at all, but actually one of the restaurant’s long hamburger buns filled with a hamburger patty, two eggs, bacon and cheese. Later in the day, you can always snack on some King Wings, which are buffalo wings marinated in honey –why aren’t these sold in America yet?

 

In many countries, including the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Colombia and Mexico, you can enjoy the deliciously fatty Cheesy Whopper, which features a deep fried disc of cheese on top of a standard Whopper.

Personally, I want to try the Hawaiian BK Chicken available in New Zealand, which is like all the other chicken sandwiches Burger King sells, only it features bacon and pineapple. Sign me up!

KFC

 

The variety of KFC’s international menus is simply astounding, as the American version exclusively limits itself to fried chicken and a few sides, while the international franchises seem to have no limits on what they serve. On the more standard side, there is the Fillet Tower Burger, which is available throughout Europe and other locations, which is essentially just a chicken sandwich topped with a hashbrown. On the other end of the spectrum is the menu from Thailand, which features stir fries, a tuna and corn salad, fish fingers (like chicken fingers, but fish) and a donut filled with shrimp meat. China offers a similarly strange menu compared to the standard KFC fare, as it includes corn salad, beef wraps, red bean porridge, shrimp burgers and an egg and vegetable soup.

 McDonald’s Biggest Customer: Not the Poor, the Middle Class 
 Posted by Alex in Economics , Food&amp;Drink on November 13, 2011 at 4:35 pm 


 Quick: 
 who is the typical customer of McDonald&apos;s? If you answer&quot;the poor,&quot;you&apos;d be wrong.

See, contrary to conventional wisdom, the poor actually don&apos;t eat a lot 
 at McDonald&apos;s, but people in the middle class do:
 
 Leigh and colleague DaeHwan Kim analyzed 1994-96 data from the 
 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and the accompanying 
 Diet and Health Knowledge Survey. The data included responses from 5,000 
 Americans who were asked about restaurant dining habits, income, race, 
 gender, age and education. 

 The researchers found that people visited fast-food restaurants 
 more often as their household income increased—at least up to 
 a point. Fast-food visits rose along with annual income up to $60,000; 
 beyond that, visits started to drop back down, replaced by full-service, 
 sit-down dining at slightly higher prices. 

 Based on the data, the researchers described the typical fast-food 
 consumer as a lower-middle income head of household, who is budget-conscious 
 and harried and likes the convenience and low price of fast food, compared 
 with other restaurants. Poor people, by contrast, can&apos;t easily afford 
 fast-food&quot;value meals,&quot;and the poorest, who may rely on 
 the FNS Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, certainly 
 can&apos;t use food stamps at McDonald&apos;s.

 What’s in the McRib Sandwich? 
 Posted by Alex in Food&amp;Drink on October 30, 2011 at 4:33 pm 


 The 
 McRib sandwich is back, and with it, the horde of cult-like fans of the 
 McDonald&apos;s pork sandwich.

Despite its name, the McRib sandwich actually contains no rib meat. But 
 what exactly is it made of?

The Week explains some of the 70 ingredients of the McRib (which you 
 may want to skip if you&apos;re a fan of the sandwich):
 
 How many ingredients are there? 
At face value, the sandwich contains just pork, onions, and pickle slices 
 slathered in barbecue sauce and laid out on a bun. But the truth is, 
 there are roughly 70 ingredients. The bun alone contains 34, says 
 TIME&apos;s Melnick . In addition to chemicals like ammonium sulfate and 
 polysorbate 80, the most egregious may be azodicarbonamide—&quot;a 
 flour-bleaching agent most commonly used in the manufactur[ing] of foamed 
 plastics like gym mats the and soles of shoes.&quot;According to McDonald&apos;s 
 own ingredient 
 list , the bun also includes calcium sulfate and ethoxylated mono- 
 and diglycerides, among other chemicals.

 McDonald’s Specification Manual

We’ve already learned that Grimace has a dark, criminal past . But the 1970s specification manual at How to Be a Retronaut also reveals that, at some point, Mayor McCheese lost his seat. Or he stopped holding his sham elections. It’s a bit ambiguous.

 The World’s Largest Big Mac 
 Posted by Stacy in Food&amp;Drink on August 16, 2011 at 9:10 am 

 Behold, the world’s largest Big Mac. The 14-foot-tall sandwich lives in the North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s, which also serves as the official Big Mac Museum. It was created for the Big Mac’s 40th anniversary in 2008. Pictured with the giant burger is Jim Delligatti, a franchisee who created the real thing back in 1967.

 Since its debut in 1979, the Happy Meal has been a staple of childhood. It’s not been without its problems, though, as nutrition-conscious parents and health-promoting legislation have worked to keep McDonald’s kids’meals within acceptable caloric standards. From the 600-calorie hamburger debut to Tuesday’s First Lady-approved changes (and a little toy trivia for good measure), check out the bumpy history of the Happy Meal on The Week. Link

 Is McDonald’s a Restaurant or a Supermarket? 
 Posted by Alex in Food&amp;Drink on July 13, 2011 at 10:50 am 

 Foodies may argue that the stuff you get from McDonald’s barely qualify as food, but we ask the question above because of the actions of the company itself.

You see, McDonald’s lawyers are arguing that the fast food chain should be classified as supermarkets rather than restaurants to avoid a huge tax bill:
 
 In a legal battle that is likely to see dozens of other fast food chains in the world’s largest country following suit, McDonald’s successfully argued that it should be classified as a food retailer for tax purposes rather than as a restaurant since many of its products are pre-packaged and sold to customers in the style of a supermarket rather than a restaurant. 

 It is a decision that will allow McDonald’s in Russia to continue paying ten per cent tax on its profits rather than the eighteen per cent tax levied on restaurants.

 The History of Ronald McDonald 
 Posted by Miss Cellania in Advertising on July 8, 2011 at 7:35 am 

 A search for the origin of a clown costume led Elyse Luray of the PBS series History Detectives to do research on how the character of Ronald McDonald came about. Several people had a hand in creating the advertising icon.
 
Around 1963, a McDonald’s in Washington, D.C., decided to boost business by sponsoring“Bozo’s Circus,”a children’s show featuring future“Today Show”weatherman Willard Scott.

It was very successful, increasing sales by 30 percent fairly quickly.

As part of the show, Scott created a new character, Ronald McDonald, that looked much different than the famed clown seen today.

This Ronald had a food tray for a hat and a paper cup for his nose, but Smith says corporation executives were able to see the possibilities for something even more iconic.
 
But it was another clown who refined the character into a company mascot. Read all about the history of the McDonalds clown at AOL Weird News. Link

 Happier Meals: Turning Big Mac Combo Into Haute Cuisine

What? You won’t stoop to eat proletariat food of McDonald’s? Perhaps all you need is a little bourgeois re-imagining.

In a project called Happier Meals for The Grid, four Toronto chefs turned a Big Mac combo (that’s burger, fries, a coke, and condiment) into a five-star meal. Well, what looks like it anyhow. This one above is by Raj and Aravind Kozhikott:
 
 Aravind’s Open-Faced Samosas 
Father-and-son team Raj and Aravind Kozhikott wanted their creation to reflect their restaurant’s Indian cuisine. To make the samosa filling, they diced the meat, mixed it with the onion and used barbecue sauce as a binding agent before wrapping it in two rolled-out-and-fried burger buns. The fries were bundled up using strips of a cut-up fry box. The cheese from the burger was scraped off the patty and used as a sauce.

 Man Ate His 25,000th Big Mac 
 Posted by Alex in Food&amp;Drink , Health on May 24, 2011 at 11:06 am 

 Don Gorske loves himself a Big Mac. Actually, he loves Big Mac so much that he eats it all the time–in fact, he’s just eaten his 25,000th Big Mac (and stays perfectly healthy):
 
 &quot;I plan on eating Big Macs until I die,&quot;the Fond du Lac, Wis., man said.&quot;I have no intentions of changing. It’s my favorite food. Nothing has changed in 39 years. I look forward to it every day.&quot; 

 Gorske, 59, says he’s in good health and that he has the checkups to prove it. His cholesterol level is low and he was given a clean bill of health two months ago during his last physical, despite the fact that he exercises minimally.

 Woman Ordered McDonald’s During Police Chase 
 Posted by Alex in Crime&amp;Law , Food&amp;Drink on April 15, 2011 at 3:30 pm 

 I’m not sure whether the Hamburglar put her up to this, but a 64-year-old woman refused to stop when pulled over by police. Instead, she got herself into a McDonald’s drive-thru lane and ordered lunch:
 
 Officer Courtney Vassell pulled up behind Spen in the drive-thru lane, and got out of the patrol car. With police lights flashing behind him, he told her to pull out into the parking lot for a traffic stop, according to a police report. 

 Spen, though, completed her food order, paid the bill, and then drove her bronze 2001 Chevrolet out of the parking lot and onto Northwest Sixth Court, Vassell said. 

 Vassell again flipped on his siren and stopped Spen outside the McDonald’s, where he said she&quot;rolled her window down one inch and said she was not speeding and she would not roll her window down.&quot;

 The Real Details of the Hot Coffee Lawsuit 
 Posted by Miss Cellania in Crime&amp;Law , Food&amp;Drink on January 14, 2011 at 11:51 am 

 When the subject of frivolous lawsuits comes up, someone always mentions the McDonalds hot coffee lawsuit as an example, because the short version sounds so outrageous: a woman sued McDonalds because her coffee was served hot. But the short version doesn’t tell us much.
 
The world’s most infamous cup of coffee spilled on February 27, 1992 in Albuquerque, NM. Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old grandmother, was a passenger in her grandson’s car when they drove through at a McDonald’s, and after she received her styrofoam cup of joe her grandson pulled the car forward and parked so Liebeck could mix in her cream and sugar.

Liebeck braced the cup between her knees, but when she tried to pull off the cup’s lid, the entire cup of coffee spilled into her lap. Although subsequent developments in the courtroom turned Liebeck and her case into objects of derision, it’s worth noting that she actually suffered legitimate injuries from the accident. Liebeck’s sweatpants absorbed the hot coffee and held it next to her skin, which helped lead to third degree burns on six percent of her body. Liebeck ended up spending eight days in the hospital and undergoing skin grafts to counter the effects of the burns.
 
But that’s only the beginning of the story. Liebeck asked McDonalds for $20,000 to cover her medical expenses and lost wages. McDonalds offered $800. That’s when the story starts to get complicated. Read the entire account of how a jury decided to award Liebeck $2.9 million when the case went to court (and that’s not even the end) at mental_floss. Link

 Man Sued McDonald’s for Making Him Fat…and Won! 
 Posted by Alex in Crime&amp;Law , Food&amp;Drink , Health on October 30, 2010 at 11:01 am 

 A lot of people probably think&quot;McDonald’s made me fat,&quot;but there’s one guy in Brazil who got the court of law to agree with him. Here’s the bizarre story of a man who sued McD for making him fat…and won!
 
 A former manager of a McDonald’s franchise in Porto Allegre, Brazil, sued the hamburger chain for making him gain 65 pounds while he worked with them for over a dozen years. McDonald’s must pay him $17,500 as recompense for his weight gain, a Brazilian court ruled on Tuesday. 

 The 32-year-old man, whose identity wasn’t disclosed, complained that the company’s policy of mandatory food sampling caused him to balloon from about 155 lbs. to 231 lbs. while working at their restaurant in southern Brazil. [...] 

 The man said that he felt forced to taste everything on the menu to ensure the quality of the food because McDonald’s hired undercover customers to randomly visit restaurants and report back on quality. 

 Also, he blamed the free lunches consisting of burgers, fries and ice cream, which contributed to his excessive weight gain during the course of employment. 

 Judge Joao Filho agreed with the man, and issued a ruling against the company, ordering them to pay $17500 to the ex-employee.

 McDonald’s New Anti-Theft Device Sprays Robbers with DNA 
 Posted by John Farrier in Crime&amp;Law , Society&amp;Culture on October 20, 2010 at 12:09 pm 

 A McDonald’s restaurant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has a sophisticated anti-theft device. It sprays robbers with a fine mist containing artificial DNA that can be seen under ultraviolet light:
 
The new system involved an employee-activated device that sprays a fine, barely visible mist laced with synthetic DNA to cover anyone in its path, including criminals, and simultaneously alerts the police to a crime in progress.

The mist — visible only under ultraviolet light — carries DNA markers particular to the location, enabling the police to match the burglar with the place burgled. Now, a sign on the front door of the McDonald’s prominently warns potential thieves of the spray’s presence: “You Steal, You’re Marked.”

 The McDonald’s Wedding Package 
 Posted by John Farrier in Business on October 14, 2010 at 2:24 pm 

 After a couple met, dated, and then hosted their wedding party at a McDonald’s location in Hong Kong, the company began offering wedding packages in that city:
 
The package has all the details to attract a wedding banquet cynic or a Golden Arches obsessive: a baked apple pie wedding cake, dress made out of party balloons, kiddie party favors for guests, and of course, catering by McDonald’s.

Alcohol is banned to make sure there won’t be drunk party guests acting inappropriately at the family venue, so newly weds will have to toast their union with soft drinks instead.

The cost will be a few thousand Hong Kong dollars, depending on what guests order on the spot. It’s unlikely that the couple will be able to book the entire restaurant for their wedding, but at that price, who cares if there are babies screaming in the booth next doors?
