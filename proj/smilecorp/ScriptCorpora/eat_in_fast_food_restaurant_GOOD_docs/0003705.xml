 Jury Duty Scam

 It is spreading fast so be prepared should you get this call. Most of us take those summonses for jury duty seriously, but enough people skip out on their civic duty, that a new and ominous kind of fraud has surfaced.

The caller claims to be a jury coordinator. If you protest that you never received a summons for jury duty, the Scammer asks you for your Social Security number and date of birth so he or she can verify the information and cancel the arrest warrant. Give out any of this information and bingo; your identity was just stolen.

The fraud has been reported so far in 11 states, including Oklahoma , Illinois , and Colorado . This (swindle) is particularly insidious because they use intimidation over the phone to try to bully people into giving information by pretending they are with the court system. The FBI and the federal court system have issued nationwide alerts on their web sites, warning consumers about the fraud. 
Check it out here: http://www.fbi.gov/page2/june06/jury_scams060206.htm &lt;http://www.fbi.gov/page2/june06/jury_scams060206.htm&gt;

 A New Way of Transmitting HIV

 Though this email that has been circulating the net for a while has been found to be untrue. We all should take precautions in public places. AIDS and many other diseases can be transmitted through blood and needles. 
This is the email that I received that has been found to be False:

A new way of transmitting HIV

This is just too shocking; it is amazing to see what the world is coming to!!!!

Dear Friends,
Kindly take a couple of minutes to go through this mail. If useful may advise others also. Please pass this on to
others.

This happened in Paris recently and may happen elsewhere also. A few weeks ago, in a movie theatre, a person felt something poking from her seat. When she got up to see what it was, she found a needle sticking out of the seat with a note attached saying,‘You have just been infected by HIV’.The Disease Control Center (in Paris) reports many similar events in many other cities recently. All tested needles were HIV Positive.The Center also reports that needles have been found in
cash dispensers at public banking machines. We ask everyone to use extreme caution when faced with this kind of situation. All public chairs/seats should be inspected with vigilance and caution before use.

A careful visual inspection should be enough. In addition, they ask that each of you pass this message along to all members of your family and your friends of the potential danger. Recently, one doctor has narrated a somewhat similar instance that happened to one of his
patients at the Priya Cinema in Delhi. A young girl, engaged and about to be married in a couple of months, was pricked while the movie was going on. The tag with the needle had the message‘Welcome to the World of HIV family’. Though the doctors told her family that it takes about 6 months before the virus grows strong enough to start damaging the system and a healthy victim could survive about 5-6 years, the girl died in 4 months, perhaps more because of the‘Shock thought’. We all have to be careful at public places, restrooms…God help! Just think about saving a life by sharing this message. Please, take a few seconds of your time to pass it on.
 

 
 Swiffer Wet Jet Ingredients and possible Fatal Liver Damage 

{ Wednesday, March 4, 2009 @ 5:40 pm }·{ Alerts , Pets }
{ Comments (2) }
 
Swiffer Wet Jet, VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE WITH ANY ONE WITH A PET or small children !!!!!!!!!!!
Recently someone had to have their 5-year old German Shepherd dog put down due to liver failure…
The dog was completely healthy until a few weeks ago, so they had a necropsy done to see what the cause was. The liver levels were unbelievable, as if the dog had ingested poison of Some kind. The dog is kept inside, and when he’s outside, someone’s with him, so the idea of him getting into something unknown was hard to believe.

My neighbor started going through all the items in the house. When he got to the Swiffer Wetjet, he noticed, in very tiny print, a warning which stated‘may be harmful to small children and animals.’He called the company to ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astounded to find out that antifreeze is one of the ingredients (actually, he was told it’s a compound which is one molecule away from antifreeze). Therefore, just by the dog walking on the floor cleaned with the
solution, then licking its own paws, it ingested enough of the solution to destroy its liver.

Soon after his dog’s death, his housekeepers’two cats also died of Liver failure. They both used the Swiffer Wetjet for quick cleanups on their floors. Necropsies weren’t done on the cats, so they couldn’t file a Lawsuit, but he asked that we spread the word to as many people as possible so they don’t lose their animals.

This is equally harmful to babies and small children that play on the floor a lot and put their fingers in their mouths a lot.

PLEASE, EVEN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE BABIES, SMALL CHILDREN OR OWN A PET;

PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION! YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN OR PETS BUT SOME OF YOU HAVE FRIENDS OR FAMILY WITH PETS AND ALSO FAMILIES WITH GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN

Thank you

NOTE: I checked this at Snopes and with the ASPCA and found that this is a rumor and these resources claim that the product is safe.  But we should all be careful with the products we use around animals and children.  Be sure to read the labels and ingredients of products because there are many toxic ingredients (especially with animals) that seems harmless but are not.

 Leptospirosis 

{ Sunday, March 1, 2009 @ 11:26 am }·{ Alerts }

This is Serious!
This incident happened recently in North Texas .
A woman went boating one Sunday taking with her some cans of coke which she put into the refrigerator of the boat. On Monday she was taken to the hospital and placed in the intensive Care Unit. She died on Wednesday.
The autopsy concluded she died of Leptospirosis. This was traced to the can of coke she drank from, not using a glass. Tests showed that the can was infected by dried rat urine and hence the disease Leptospirosis.
Rat urine contains toxic and deathly substances. It is highly recommended to thoroughly wash the upper part of soda cans before drinking out of them. The cans are typically stocked in ware houses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned.

A study at NYCU showed that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets (i.e). full of germs and bacteria. So wash them with water before putting them to the mouth to avoid any kind of fatal accident.

___________________________

Although Snopes says this email is false, I checked the CDC site and there is such a disease and can be spread by rat urine not only in humans but in pets.
 

 
 Crooks and cell phones

A MUST READ

ALL FAMILY MEMBERS SHOULD READ THIS, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN!

These crooks are getting very good!

A lady has changed her habit of how she lists her names in her cell phone directory after her handbag was stolen.

Her handbag, which contained her cell phone, credit card, purse, etc.., was stolen.

Twenty minutes later she called her husband, from a pay telephone telling him what had happened.

Her husband said,‘I have just received your text message asking about our pin number and I have replied a little while ago.’

When they rushed down to the bank, the staff told them all the money was already withdrawn.

The thief had actually used the stolen cell phone to text her husband listed in the directory and got hold of their pin number.

Within twenty minutes he had withdrawn all the money from their bank account.

Moral of the lesson:

Do not disclose the relationship between you and the people on your call list.

Avoid using names like Home, Honey, Hubby, Sweetheart, Mom, Dad, etc.,

And very importantly, when sensitive information is being asked for through text messages, CONFIRM by calling back.

Also, when you are being text by friends or family to meet them somewhere, be sure to call back to confirm that the message came from them.

If you do not reach them, be very careful about going places to meet‘family and friends’who text you.

PLEASE PASS THIS ON.

I never thought about THAT!

As of right now, do you have‘home’listed in your cell phone directory?
 

 
 Nurse’s Heart Attack Experience

NURSE’S HEART ATTACK EXPERIENCE

This has been  passed on from an ER nurse and is the best description of this event that she had ever heard. Please read, pay attention, and share this!

FEMALE HEART ATTACKS

I was aware that female heart attacks are different, but this is the best description I’ve ever read.

Women and heart attacks (Myocardial Infarction).  Did you know that women rarely have the same dramatic symptoms that men have when experiencing heart attack .. you know, the sudden stabbing pain in the chest, the cold sweat, grabbing the chest&amp;dropping to the floor that we see in the movies.  Here is the story of one woman’s experience with a heart attack.

I had a heart attack at about 10 :30 PM with NO prior exertion, NO prior emotional trauma that one would suspect might’ve brought it on.
I was sitting all snugly&amp;warm on a cold evening, with my purring cat in my lap, reading an interesting story my friend had sent me, and actually thinking,‘A-A-h, this is the life, all cozy and warm in my soft, cushy Lazy Boy with my feet propped up.

A moment later, I felt that awful sensation of indigestion, when you’ve been in a hurry and grabbed a bite of sandwich and washed it down with a dash of water, and that hurried bite seems to feel like you’ve swallowed a golf ball going down the esophagus in slow motion and it is most uncomfortable. You realize you shouldn’t have gulped it down so fast and needed to chew it more thoroughly and this time drink a glass of water to hasten its progress down to the stomach. This was my initial sensation—the only trouble was that I hadn’t taken a bite of anything since about 5:00 p.m.

After it seemed to subside, the next sensation was like little squeezing motions that seemed to be racing up my SPINE (hind-sight, it was probably my aorta spasming), gaining speed as they continued racing up and under my sternum (breast bone, where one presses rhythmically when administering CPR).

This fascinating process continued on into my throat and branched out into both jaws.‘AHA!! NOW I stopped puzzling about what was happening—we all have read and/or heard about pain in the jaws being one of the signals of an MI happening, haven’t we?  I said aloud to myself and the cat,‘Dear God, I think I’m having a heart attack!’

I lowered the footrest dumping the cat from my lap, started to take a step and fell on the floor instead. I thought to myself, If this is a heart attack, I shouldn’t be walking into the next room where the phone is or anywhere else…but, on the other hand, if I don’t, nobody will know that I need help, and if I wait any longer I may not be able to get up in moment.

I pulled myself up with the arms of the chair, walked slowly into the next room and dialed the Paramedics .. I told her I thought I was having a heart attack due to the pressure building under the sternum and radiating into my jaws. I didn’t feel hysterical or afraid, just stating the facts.  She said she was sending the Paramedics over immediately, asked if the front door was near to me, and if so, to unbolt the door and then lie down on the floor where they could see me when they came in.

I unlocked the door and then lay down on the floor as instructed and lost consciousness, as I don’t remember the medics coming in, their examination, lifting me onto a gurney or getting me into their ambulance, or hearing the call they made to St. Jude ER on the way, but I did briefly awaken when we arrived and saw that the Cardiologist was already there in his surgical blues and cap, helping the medics pull my stretcher out of the ambulance. He was bending over me asking questions (probably something like‘Have you taken any medications?”but I couldn’t make my mind interpret what he was saying, or form an answer,  and nodded off again, not waking up until the Cardiologist and partner had already threaded the teeny angiogram balloon up my femoral artery into the aorta and into my heart where they installed 2 side by side stents to hold open my right coronary artery.

I know it sounds like all my thinking and actions at home must have taken at least 20-30 minutes before calling the Paramedics, but actually it took perhaps 4-5 minutes before the call, and both the fire station and St. Jude are only minutes away from my home, and my Cardiologist was already to go to the OR in his scrubs and get going on restarting my heart (which had stopped somewhere between my arrival and the procedure) and installing the stents.

Why have I written all of this to you with so much detail?  Because I want all of  you to know what I learned first hand.

1.  Be aware that something very different is happening in your body not the usual men’s symptoms but  inexplicable things happening (until my sternum and jaws got into the act).  It is said that many more  women than men die of their first (and last) MI  because they didn’t know they were having one and commonly mistake it as indigestion, take some Maalox or other anti-heartburn preparation and go to bed, hoping they’ll feel better in the morning when they wake up…which doesn’t happen. My female friends, your symptoms might not be exactly like mine, so I advise you to call the Paramedics if ANYTHING is unpleasantly happening that you’ve not felt before. It is better to have a‘false alarm’visitation than to risk your life guessing what it might be!

2.  Note that I said”Call the Paramedics.”And if you can,  take an aspirin.  Ladies, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!  Do NOT try to drive yourself to the ER you are a hazard  to others on the road. Do NOT have your panicked husband who will be speeding  and looking anxiously at what’s happening with you instead of the road. Do NOT call your doctor—he doesn’t know where you  live and if it’s at night you won’t reach him anyway, and if it’s daytime, his assistants (or answering service) will  tell you to call the Paramedics. He doesn’t carry the equipment in his car that you need to be saved! The Paramedics do, principally OXYGEN that you need ASAP. Your Dr. will be notified later.

3.   Don’t assume it couldn’t be a heart attack because you have a normal cholesterol count.  Research has discovered that a cholesterol elevated reading is rarely the cause of an MI (unless it’s unbelievably high and/or accompanied  by high blood pressure). MI’s are usually caused by long-term stress and inflammation in the  body,  which dumps all sorts of deadly hormones into your system to sludge things up in there.
Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep.
Let’s be careful and be aware. The more we know,  the better chance we could survive.

A cardiologist says, if everyone who gets this email sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we’ll save at least one life.
 

 
 Warning Pet Pimple Ball 

{ Saturday, January 17, 2009 @ 5:05 pm }·{ Alerts , Pets }
{ Leave a Comment }
 
 

On June 22, 2008 , my 10-year old lab mix, Chai, sustained a severe injury from a product that the company Four Paws, Inc., produces. The toy I’m referencing is the pimple ball with bell (Item #20227-001, UPC Code #0 4566320227 9).

While chewing on the toy, a vacuum was created and it effectively sucked his tongue into the hole in the ball.. From speaking with my vet, this likely occurred because there is not a second hole in the ball

preventing the vacuum effect from happening. I became aware of this when Chai approached a friend at my home whimpering with the ball in his mouth. She tried unsuccessfully to remove the ball but the tongue had swollen and could not be released.

Chai was taken to the Animal Medical Center (an emergency care facility in New York City ) and was treated by Dr. Nicole Spurlock to have the ball removed. Because the size of the opening on the ball was so small, all circulation to his tongue was cut off. The doctors had to sedate him in order to remove it. Once the ball was removed, his tongue swelled to the point that he could no longer put it in his mouth. Chai was sent home with care instructions and to be observed overnight for any changes.

By the following morning, Chai’s tongue had swollen even more.

This is the dog’s tongue not the Toy!
He was taken to his regular vet, Dr. Timnah Lee, for treatment. He

was admitted and kept sedated for a period of three days during which time they were treating his wounds and waiting to determine how much of his tongue could be saved. On June 26, 2008 , Chai had his tongue amputated.

He was kept in after-care for an additional three days. On Sunday, June 29th, I brought Chai home from the vet with a barrage of home care instructions, to last for an additional 7 days. His next visit was to have his mouth re-examined and have the feeding tube in his neck removed.

On the way home from the vet we stopped at Petland Discount where I purchased their product to speak to the manager on duty. Upon meeting Chai and seeing his condition, he removed all of the balls in question from the shelves. He also gave me the customer service number to their corporate headquarters to request that they refuse to continue purchasing all Four Paws products, but I have not called them as of yet.

Additionally, I shared my story with friends who have a French Bulldog named Petunia. Upon hearing my story, their eyes widened. They explained that the same thing happened twice in one night with a smaller version of the same ball to their dog. Fortunately, they were able to pull it off before the tongue swelled, but not without tremendous effort and pain to the dog. They recalled how horrific it was to hear their dog screaming while they had to pry the ball from her tongue.

To date, my veterinary bills total over $5,000 and I will have regular follow up appointments for some time. Additionally, Chai now requires a much more expensive form of food because of this injury, averaging approximately $200 per month.

Additionally, I now have to re-teach my dog to eat, drink and adjust to life without his tongue. Feeding him takes me about 90 minutes twice a day and for at least this first week he is not to be unattended for more than 20 minutes at a time.

I sent this information, along with the reference to the French Bulldog, to Four Paws, Inc., and it is their position that there just aren’t enough instances to do anything about this. I told their insurance company’s case manager that was not a good enough excuse. It was inferred that my dog’s value wasn’t much and that his pain and suffering don’t count as he is just a piece of property.

This is a TRUE story–I checked with Snopes: http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/pimpleball.asp

Heart Attacks And Drinking Warm Water

 

 

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your meal, but about Heart Attacks . The Chinese and Japanese drink hot tea with their meals, not cold water, maybe it is time we adopt their drinking habit  while eating.

 

For those who like to drink cold water, this article is applicable to you. It is nice to have a cup of cold drink after a meal. However, the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed. It will slow down the digestion. Once this‘sludge’reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.

Common Symptoms Of Heart Attack…
A serious note about heart attacks–You should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting . Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line .
You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms. 60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep. Let’s be careful and be aware. The more we know, the better chance we could survive.
A cardiologist says if everyone who reads this message sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we’ll save at least one life. Read this&amp;Send to a friend. It could save a life. So, please be a true friend and send this article to all your friends you care about.

True checked Snopes website: http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/hairband.asp

Hair Band Information Important!

Be cautious of hair bands at open markets around the city too–they are probably from China since they are purchased in bulk very very cheap !!!!
Take a good look before buying hair bands in future–specially like the following kind…..

 

These Hair bands were made from used condoms and threads. That was so disgusting, I would not want to use them!!
 

 

 

BEIJING (AFP)–Used condoms are being recycled into hair bands in southern China threatening to spread sexually-transmittable diseases they were originally meant to prevent, state media reported Tuesday

In the latest example of potentially harmful Chinese-made products, rubber hair bands have been found in local markets and beauty salons in Dongguan and Guangzhou cities in southern Guangdong province, China Daily newspaper said.

‘These cheap and colorful rubber bands and hair ties sell well….. threatening the health of local people,’it said.
Despite being recycled, the hair bands could still contain bacteria and viruses, it said.

‘People could be infected with AIDS, (genital) warts or other diseases if they hold the rubber bands or strings in their mouths while waving their hair into plaits or buns,’the paper quoted a local dermatologist who gave only his surname, Dong, as saying. A bag of ten of the recycled bands sells for just 25 s en (three cents), much cheaper than others on the market, accounting for their popularity, the paper said.

A government official was quoted as saying recycling condoms was illegal.    China‘s manufacturing industry has been repeatedly tarnished this year by a string of scandals involving shoddy or dangerous goods made for both domestic and foreign markets.
 

 
 Lock Your Car Safely

I did the Snopes sight as did the person who sent the email.

http://www.snopes.com/autos/techno/lockcode.asp

Cars that were made in the mid 1990′s and before are vulnerable to this but the newer ones are suppose to be safer.

Ron received this e-mail from State Farm regional office this morning.

Something good to know especially during the holiday shopping.

This was an E-mail I received from another AFS in Texas. Something to be aware of…

Snopes approved.

I locked my car—as I walked away I heard my car door unlock. I went back and locked my car again three times.
I looked around and there were two guys sitting in a car in the fire lane next to the store.
When I looked straight at them they did not unlock my car again.

How to lock your car safely ~

While traveling my son stopped at a roadside park. He came out to his car less than 4-5 minutes later and found someone had gotten into his car, and stolen his cell phone, laptop computer, GPS navigator, briefcase…you name it…called the police and since there were no signs of his car being broken into- the police told him that there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your key-chain locking device.

They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. They know you are going inside of the store, restaurant, or bathroom and have a few minutes to steal and run. The police officer said…to be sure to manually lock your car door-by hitting the lock button inside the car, that way if there is someone sitting in a parking lot watching for their next victim it will not be you. When you hit the lock button on your car upon exiting…it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the door lock on your key chain- it sends the code through the airwaves where it can be stolen, something totally new to us…and real…be aware of this and please pass this note on. Just think about how many times we all lock our doors with our keys…

Keep safe everyone!

 Every Woman Should Know 

Every woman should know this: How can you tell when you are in a room, restroom, motel etc. with a mirror or a 2-way glass?

 Here’s how: I thought it was quite interesting! And I know in about 30 seconds you’re going to do what I did and find the nearest mirror…. Do you know how to determine if a mirror is 2-way or not?  This is not to scare you, but to make you aware.  A policewoman who travels all over the U.S. and gives seminars and techniques for businesswomen passed this on.  When we visit toilets, bathrooms, hotel rooms, changing rooms, etc., how many of you know for sure that the seemingly or denary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror, or actually a 2-way mirror (i.e. they can see you, but you can’t see them)? 

 There have been many cases of people installing 2-way mirrors in female changing rooms. It is very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? Just conduct this simple test: 

 Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS a 2-WAY MIRROR! ‘No Space, Leave the Place’So remember, every time you see a Mirror, do the‘fingernail test.’It doesn’t cost you anything. 

 Remember:
No Space, Leave the Place’! 

 Ladies: Share this with your girlfriends, sisters, daughters, etc. 

 Men: Share this with your wives, daughters, daughters-in-law, mothers, girlfriends and/or friends

 Please Help Bella Bleu! 

 
 

 A fund raiser has started at fundable.com for a precious little Chihuahua named Bella Bleu.  She is seriously in need of medical attention and I don’t have the funds to cover these costs. 

 If you could go to this link: http://www.fundable.com/groupactions/groupaction.2008-11-16.6675150720 and donate at least 10 dollars, I may be able to afford to help my sweet dog.  Please copy and send this link to everyone you know that cares about animals. 

 There is a deadline of December 10th to meet on this fund raising site.  So please donate and please share this information as soon as possible.  The sooner donations start coming in—The sooner more people on the site may take notice and also help.  Your help will be greatly appreciated. 

 Her Story: 

 When she turned 6 months old, I took her into the vet to have her spayed.  The vet advised me (as she does for all of her patients) to have lab work on her before surgery to make sure there would not be any complications.  After dropping her off for surgery that morning, I treated myself to breakfast at the Cracker Barrel.  That’s when I received the call from the vet.  She said that she could not perform the surgery on Bella until further lab work was done.  Because Bella’s liver enzyme levels were triple what the normal level should be.  That day I thought I might lose Bella.  I sat in the vet’s office and tried to hold back tears–my heart was breaking.  Little did I know that it would be years of torment for all of us, especially for Bella.  The vet suggested I follow up with the lab work 2 or 3 times (once again at her office and then again to be sent out to another lab).  But the test all showed abnormalities.  In the process of waiting through all of these tests, Bella developed another problem.  She started having seizures because her blood sugar would drop.  She goes into a frozen state; teeth clamped tightly, body stiff, shaking terribly, she cannot not move at all.  If someone were not around to give her syrup, she could go into a diabetic coma and die.  I told the vet about these seizures and she said that giving syrup was sufficient and to keep her on a very strict diet.  The vet then advised me to take Bella to an internist and have an ultrasound done.  Even though I only had one option to pay for the test, through a credit card (which I’d already spent around 500 dollars just for the testing and visits to the vet), I had to make the appointment with the internist.  The internist looked over Bella’s previous labs and said that there was not enough evidence to warrant an ultra sound, but she would run the test again at their lab and go from there.  Their lab showed the same results, but the internist said to just keep following up with the test every 6 months to monitor changes because she knew the financial situation would not allow me to pay the 600 dollar ultra sound bill. 

 To this very day, Bella has had to endure the seizures and continuation of lab tests which are not pleasant (they have to draw blood directly from her neck every time).  This last visit to the vet was the same except the vet finally did a check on Bella’s blood sugar level.  It was extremely low and sugar was found in her urine.  She said that I need to go back to see the internist and have the ultra sound so that I can get her spayed and a liver biopsy.  Well, after going through the entire amount allowed on the credit card–I don’t have the money even for the internist office visit, much less for the 600 dollar ultra sound and then the 400 dollar spay and liver biopsy costs.  This is why I am reaching out to you.  Please help save my precious Bella Bleu.  Her life will be cut very short, if I cannot get the ultra sound and the spay and liver biopsy.  Please help her to have the happy and normal life she so deserves.  Your financial assistance and your prayers will be greatly appreciated.

 Gas Stations Scam

Gas Stations Scam

This is a (supposedly) true story, so read it carefully.  On April 24, 2008, I stopped at a Kangaroo gas station in Cartersville, GA.  My truck’s gas gauge was on 1/4 of a tank.   I use the mid-grade, which was priced at $3.71 per gallon.  When my tank is at this point, it takes somewhere around 14 gallon’s to fill it up.  When the pump showed 14 gallons had been pumped I began to slow it down, then to my surprise it went to 15, then 16.  I even looked under my truck to see if it was being spilled.  It was not.  Then it showed 17 gallons had been pumped.  It stopped at almost 18 gallons.  This was very strange to me, since my truck has only an 18 gallon tank.  I went on my way a little confused, then on the evening news I heard a report that 1 out of 4 gas stations had calibrated their pumps to show more gas had been pumped than a person actually got.

Here is how to check a pump to see if you are getting the right amount.  Whichever grade you are using, put exactly 10 gallons in your tank, then look at the dollar amount, if the dollar amount is not exactly 10 times the price of the fuel you have chosen, then the pumps are rigged.  If you find a station that is cheating, contact the Agriculture Department or proper authorities.

We need to put a stop to this outrageous cheating of customers.  The gas companies are making enough profits at honest rates.
 

 
 Pet Owners Beware of Using Cocoa Mulch

PET OWNER WARNING
Please read and be cautious while gardening. Also pass it on to your pet lover friends.

URGENT info for pet owners……

Yesterday, one of our clients experienced a tragedy and wanted me to pass a special message along to all of my dog loving friends and family. I was hoping you could forward this to your contact list.

My client was the doting owner of two young lab/golden retriever mixes. Over the weekend, they purchased Cocoa Mulch from Target to use in their garden. They loved the way it smelled and it was advertised to keep cats away from their garden. They set the bag in their yard. Their dog Calypso, decided that the mulch smelled good enough to eat so she broke into it and devoured a large helping. She vomited a few times which was typical of her when she would get into something she shouldn’t?t have gotten in to. She was not acting lethargic in any way. The next day, Mom woke up and took Calypso out for her morning walk. Half way through the walk, she had a seizure and died instantly. Although the mulch had NO warnings printed on the label, upon further investigation on the company’s website, this product is HIGHLY toxic to dogs. Denise (Calypso’s mom) wanted me to pass this information along so no one had to experience the same tragedy she went through.

In Loving Memory of Calypso.

Cocoa Mulch is manufactured by Hershey’s, and they claim that“It is true that studies have shown that 50% of the dogs that eat Cocoa Mulch can suffer physical harm to a variety of degrees (depending on each individual dog). However, 98% of all dogs won’t eat it.”
Found at: http://www.hoax-slayer.com/cocoa-mulch-warning.html
It is true that Cocoa Mulch can contain substances that can harm dogs if ingested in sufficient quantities. Cocoa Mulch is made from the shell of the cocoa bean and is a by-product of chocolate production. Since the mulch is organic in nature, works well, looks good and can give the garden a pleasant chocolaty smell, it is popular with home gardeners. However, cocoa mulch can contain theobromine and caffeine, which are chemicals called methylxanthines that can be harmful to dogs. Dogs that consume cocoa mulch can develop methylxanthine toxicosis, a condition that can result in symptoms similar to canine chocolate poisoning.

 Next President

 Each and everyone who votes needs to be sure to visit all of the candidates web sites. Closely read where they stand on the issues that are important to you personally. If you are really concerned about our nation and the world, carefully consider how each candidate states their views and their plans to make a change.  Here is where you will need to read between the lines.  After all, they do hire speech writers.  And as you watch the debates and the interviews of these politicians, don’t forget to look into their eyes, watch their facial expressions, and their body language.  Their speech is not nearly as important as these things because they’ve been rehearsed a thousand times.  Outward bodily expressions are the most revealing about the people. Especially those who are vying to become our next leader and president.  They are human beings just like you and can only hide a small amount of what is really felt inside. Each of the candidates are swearing that they are here to make a“change”. And they are stating this because they know that every American is sick of what has happened and is happening with the current administration.  Bottom line is they know what you want to hear.  As you take time (hopefully you will) to review their web sites, you’ll notice all of the stands/views are of the same idea and very closely the same procedure for change.  They are basically the same statements–only phrased different here and there. Experience is of Great Importance!  If you were an employer, you wouldn’t hire the person with the least experience for an important–life changing job.  Regardless of age, color, gender, or physical appearance–You know you would want the person you could trust to get the job done based on their prior achievements. Let’s try to remember that this is our opportunity as a nation to hire the person who will do the job right this time around.  It is Not personality, age, gender, or color that should win this job. But more importantly the one who can get the job done based on their history. I know that I want a strong leader with experience, patience, intelligence, and one who has a conscience.  What are the qualifications you are looking for in our next leader?

 Scams at the registers 

 A few weeks ago I got an email about a scam that the cashiers at Wal-Mart are pulling. You use your debit card without requesting cash back and the cashier does something on her/his machine that requests cash back and then puts your cash in their pocket. Well, it just happened to me at the Wal-Mart on Route 40. I know darn well I hit no for cash back. But had I looked away I wouldn’t have seen the next screen light up for $80 cash back. I looked at it and said, $80 cash back!! I hit “No.” Well the cashier says, “there must be something wrong with the machine because you’re the 2 nd person that happened to” “the $80 button must be right above the no.” No, it is not. The no button is at the very bottom of the screen, nowhere near the dollar amounts for cash back. I just said, “Give Me My $80!!!” So she goes back in the drawer for it. I was heated. I always look at my receipt; I don’t always watch the screen. But had I walked away and went back she may have tried to argue with me. 

 Nevertheless, the email is true. They are trying to cheat you when you use your debit card and since I know we all at SSA frequent that Wal-Mart I wanted to let you know it’s happening up there. 
 

 
 IM Story

 This occurred in NC.  The guy is from Raleigh .

Please read this to the bottom. No matter what age you are, this is very
important! For those of you with children and/or grandchildren, please
take note!! 

 Shannon could hear  the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home. 

 

The thought of being  followed made her heart beat faster.“You’re being silly, she told  herself,“no one is following you.”To be safe, she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up with her pace.

 

She was afraid to look back and she  was glad she was almost home. Shannon said a quick prayer,“God please get me home safe.”She saw the porch light burning and she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the safety of her home.
 

 

 

 

 She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk was empty. 

 

 After tossing her books on the sofa, she decided to grab a snack and get on-line. She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213. She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was on. She sent him an instant message: 

 

 

 

 ByAngel213: Hi. I’m glad you are on! I thought someone was following me home today. It was really weird!
 

 

 

 GoTo123: LOL you watch too much TV. Why would someone be following you? Don’t you live in a safe neighborhood? 

 

 

 

 ByAngel213: Of course  I do. LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz’I
didn’t see anybody when I looked out.
 

 

 

 

 GoTo123: Unless you  gave your name out on-line. You haven’t done that
have you?
 

 

 

 ByAngel213: Of course not. I’m not stupid you know.
 

 

 

 

 GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school today?
 

 

 

 

 ByAngel213: Yes and we  won!!
 

 

 GoTo123: That’s great! Who did you play? 

 

 

 ByAngel213: We played the Hornets. LOL their uniforms are so gross! They look like bees.  LOL 

 

 

 

 

 GoTo123: What is your team called? 

 

 

 

 

 ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats. We have tiger paws on our
uniforms. They are really  cool. 

 

 

 

 

 GoTo123: Did you  pitch?
 

 

 ByAngel213: No I play second base. I got to go. My homework has to be
done before my parents get home.  I don’t want them mad at me. Bye! 

 

 

 

 

 GoTo123: Catch you  later. Bye 

 

 

 

 

 Meanwhile……GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to search for her profile. When it came up, he highlighted  it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far. 

 Her name:  Shannon 

 Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985 

 Age: 13 

 State where she lived: North Carolina 

 Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall. 

 

 Besides this  information, he knew she lived in Canton because she had
just told him. He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 p.m. Every
afternoon until her parents came home from work. He knew she played
softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team, and the team was
named the Canton Cats. Her favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. 

 He knew she was in the eighth grade at the Canton Junior High School . She had told him all  this in the conversations they had on-line. 

 He had enough information to find her now.
 Shannon didn’t tell her parents about the incident on the way home 

 from the ball park that day. She didn’t want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games. Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had brothers and sisters, her parents wouldn’t be so overprotective. 

 By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her. 

 Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely. He was leaning  against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He didn’t look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt. 

 After the game, he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach. She
noticed his smile once again as she walked past him. He nodded and she
smiled back. 

 He noticed her name on the back of her shirt. He knew he had found her. 

 Quietly, he walked  a safe distance behind her. 

 It was only a few blocks to Shannon ‘s home, and once he saw  where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car. 

 Now he had to wait. He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came
to go to Shannon ‘s house. He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat
there until time to make his move. 

 Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the
living room.“ Shannon , come here,”her father called. He sounded upset and she couldn’t imagine why. She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.
“Sit down,”her father began,“this man has just told us a most
interesting story about you.” 

 Shannon sat back.  How could he tell her parents anything? She had never seen him before today! 

 “Do you know who I am, Shannon ?”the man asked. 

 “No,” Shannon answered.“I am a police officer and  your online friend, GoTo123.” 

 Shannon was stunned.“That’s impossible! GoTo is a kid my age! He’s 14
and he lives in Michigan !” 

 The man smiled.“I know I told you all that, but it wasn’t true. You see,
 Shannon ,  there are people on-line who pretend to be kids; I was one of
them. But while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong to a
group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators. I came here to find you, to teach you how dangerous it is to talk to people on-line. 

 You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you. 

 Your name, the school you went to, the name of your ball team and the position you played.  The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze.” 

 Shannon was stunned.“You mean you don’t live in Michigan ?” 

 He laughed.“No, I live in Raleigh . It made you feel safe to think I was
so far away, didn’t it?”She nodded. 

 “I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she wasn’t as lucky.
The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the
time on-line. The wrong people trick you into giving out information a
little here and there on-line.  Before you know it, you have told them
enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it.”I
hope you’ve learned a lesson from this and won’t do it again.
