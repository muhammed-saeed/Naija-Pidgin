I read a story about a singer finding a nasty surprise in her food. It made me think twice about eating out at a restaurant.

 The News
 Singer/actress Christina Milian found a nasty surprise in her food. She was eating at a restaurant and got the shock of her life when she tried to eat her salad. She ended up having a wad of gum in her mouth after eating her salad. The gum in her salad was already chewed when it was in Christina Milian’s mouth. She was convinced that the waitress put the gum in her salad before serving it to her.

Christina Milian reported the incident to the Los Angeles Department Of Health. She is considering taking legal action against the waitress. She has stopped eating at fast food restaurants because of this incident. Her health is important to her and she doesn’t want to take any risks of getting sick.

 My Thoughts
 That is really disgusting to find chewed gum in your food. I would be horrified if I found something like that in my food. You really do have to check your food thoroughly before eating out. You never know what could be hidden inside your food. 

I wonder why the waitress did something like that to Christina Milian. Was Christina being a rude customer? Did they know each other prior to this incident? Did the waitress want to lose her job? She must want to lose her job if she would do something so nasty to someone else’s food. What was the waitress thinking? What if someone did that to her food? She would want something to be done about it too.

What are your thoughts on this story? This has never happened to me before, but I will definitely check my food now. If you were Christina, would you sue if you found a nasty surprise in your food?

Great article. Perhaps she did that to the actress because she was jealous and working at a fast food restaurant and in comes an atress who is famous. Whatver the reason it was wrong of her to do.
 PR Mace Posted September 26, 2011 at 4:49 pm 
I would be suing.

I think that’s an accident only. Restaurant workers are doing their job carefully as much as possible. Foreign object coming from food was being an accidental in nature.
 Lady Sunshine Posted September 26, 2011 at 5:38 pm 
That is nasty!! But I’m not pretentious enough to sue. Americans are so damn litigious. lol.
 SharifaMcFarlane Posted September 26, 2011 at 5:39 pm 
Oh that’s disgusting. Makes me wonder if it was put there intentionally.
 Brenda Nelson Posted September 26, 2011 at 5:41 pm 
I find gum gross anyhow, prechewed and in my food or not.
 Melody SJAL Posted September 26, 2011 at 5:48 pm 
Disgustingindeed.

Maybe the gum fell in the food and the waitress didn’t know it. Whatever, I wouldn’t eat there anymore. I do think that waitresses or cooks shouldn’t be allowed to chew gum on the job.
 The Silver Phoenix Posted September 26, 2011 at 7:49 pm 
it must have been such a shock to poor christina. it might be better to eat home food next time. a very entertaining read.

It can be a lesson for Christina&amp;other

Well, it’s not proved that it was done by waitress, but not by a salad-maker. The legal action should be taken against the restaurant, otherwise an innocent person (waitress) will be punished.
 DHEERUMT Posted September 26, 2011 at 11:36 pm 
dont understand why she did it
 beingwell Posted September 28, 2011 at 8:49 pm 
Yikes!
 LoveDoctor Posted September 28, 2011 at 11:32 pm 
People have told me that if you’re a rude customer things like this can happen. Is Christina sure that the waitress did this? Maybe she had gum in her mouth before she started eating and it fell into the salad. It can happen to anyone. You’ve been chewing a piece of gum for a long time, it loses its taste and sticks in the back of your mouth. Well, she might have had a problem with the waitress or someone at the restaurant. Who knows what happens behind the kitchen, but then again, it’s not such a good idea to eat salad in a restaurant because you just never know if they wash it properly. A while back there was a big incident at a Wendy’s here in Florida. This lady started to eat her burger I believe it was and as she started to chew, she bit into a tooth. I was so disgusted when I heard the news that I never ate at Wendy’s again. Not sure if the woman took legal action.

Some action must be taken,that is the sole job at a restaurant, concerning cooking and serving, if that is not done properly what for is she there?
 CHAN LEE PENG Posted September 29, 2011 at 10:29 am 
I will find this disgusting and ignoring it.
 Authoress Terry E. Lyle Posted September 29, 2011 at 4:18 pm 
Yuck!
I would be putting on boxing gloves then I’d sue!
 Starpisces Posted October 1, 2011 at 10:20 pm 
If I were the customer, I definitely confront the restuarant, whether to sue or not depend on their sincerity of their apologies. By the way, chewing gum is banned in my country.
Very interesting story.

Eeewww!!! I once found a metal shaving in my clam linguini. Probably the kitchen staff were cleaning clam shells with a metal pad and a bit of it ended up in my pasta. Checking your food at restaurants is definitely a good idea.
 Judy Sheldon Posted October 8, 2011 at 4:34 pm 
I have been disgusted by hair in my food before. No one wants a foreign object in their food.

Perhaps the person who tossed the salad accidentally dropped it into the food, regardless of who did it, it is definitely enough to make one rethink going out to eat.
