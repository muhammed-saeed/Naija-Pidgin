 Incorporated: 1741

 Origin:
This was one of the last towns chartered by Massachusetts Governor
Jonathan Belcher prior to the establishment of New Hampshire as an
independent province. Once a parish of Exeter, Epping was incorporated
as a separate town in 1741. It was probably named for Epping Forest, a
suburb of London used by royalty for deer hunting, which was likely
familiar to Governor Belcher. Epping was the home of three of New
Hampshire&apos;s governors: William Plumer (1759-1850), David Morril
(1772-1849), and Benjamin Franklin Prescott (1833-1895).
