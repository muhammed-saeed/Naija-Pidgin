 Best Answer - Chosen by Asker
 *Keep Drinks Full
*Smile
*Make sure their condiments/silverware/napkins are all there ( Ketchup, salt ... etc )
*Be on top of things
*Don&apos;t just walk ... walk fast - like what you&apos;re doing is important
* Offer advise when asked - try out the menu so you know what you&apos;re talking about&amp;be honest
*Don&apos;t bug - but don&apos;t forget to ask how they&apos;re doing
* Treat your customers like you just sat down for dinner - act the way you would want your waitress to be ... !

It&apos;s a stressful job&amp;it teaches you to multitask like crazy ... I loved doing it - nothing is ever the same&amp;most of the time it was the customers that made my day a lot more fun ... be nice&amp;thoughtful most of the time you&apos;ll get the same attitude back ... oh and never let the customers know you&apos;re stressed out or too busy ... act like you have things under control ... good luck&amp;have fun ... !

 Wayne K The best way to make tips is to get to know the customers by name, find out their likes and dislikes and emphasize on them.
Buy color books&amp;stickers&amp;give them to the children at your tables. Make the kids happy,make the parents happy.
#1 rule is keep drinks FULL&amp;let them know their is almost out.

 Know the menu and have some favorites ready to recommend. Just make sure you do not recommend the most expensive item. Some people will think you recommend it only to make the bill larger.
Serve ladies first then the men with the host being last (if the host is a male that is).
One of the best tools you can have is a Maitre d&apos;pad. It has lines and columns for each seat so you can write down drink app, entree, side, desert, and special instructions. This way you also know who ordered what and you do not have to auction off the food at the table.&quot;Who had the rib-eye medium rare&quot;. This is very impressive to the guest.
Try to learn the last name of the host or of the couple or single guest there and call them by name. You can do this usually from the reservation or even ask. Every ones favorite name is their own. Remember to use it when you drop of the bill or return the credit card after they are ready to pay. You can get the name off the card as well. Say&quot;thank you Mr./Mrs Smith. Have a great night/day/Xmas/Kwanzaa.&quot;People love hearing their own name!!!!!!!!!!!!

 You must be observant and be able to anticipate your customer&apos;s needs. And you must know how to multi task. Move quickly and don&apos;t waste time. And be nice, but not phony.

 The biggest way to get better tips is to know the menu very very well so that you can sell more. Other than that it has to do with service. Make sure you get the orders down right and communicate with the table thru the entire meal. If an item is taking what seems to be a long time getting out to a table go check on it and then tell your guest that it should be out shortly. Never give specific times. Also try to anticipate guest needs and get things like appetizer plates out before the appetizer gets to the table. As for the fellow who answered before me. I&apos;m not sure what kind of places you eat but I&apos;m very glad you&apos;ll never go to the restaurant I work at more than once because you would be a terrible guest. You always tell your guest to have a great evening before they leave and you always ask them how their food is once they have taken 2 bites or after 2 minutes. 90% of people will never complain about their food if you don&apos;t ask or notice something is wrong. Also referring to a waiter or waitress as a dip stick is really telling of what kind of person you are. Truth be known if your in a decent establishment most of the server and bar staff has a very good chance of being much more educated than you. In the case of the person above me I could almost guarantee it because I doubt you could afford to eat somewhere really nice.

 I work as a server at the Bonefish Grill. Nothing like a part time weekend job that pays upwards of 20.00 an hour to pay your way thru college.

 Be friendly, courteous, and make sure to see that your guest is taking care of, like water always full, ask if everything is o.k. and smile as often as you can, make suggestions, and do not crack under pressure.

 it&apos;s usually 5% of the bill and it depends on where you work too.

I find waitresses that are always around but never hoovering are the best. I&apos;ve been to a lot of restraunts were they are always asking questions and trying to be there too much. Then at Applebee&apos;s we had a waitress that always made sure our glasses were full and check up on maybe once during the meal. It all depends on the customers really, if they always want your attention give it to them within reason.

 Be polite. Be friendly. Try to anticipate needs (if someone has a messy sandwich, bring extra napkins without waiting for them to ask, or if someone is using all the sweet and low on the table, bring more before they run out). Pay attention to what people might need. It is a pleasant surprise to have things brought to you before you have to ask for them. Don&apos;t stand around gossiping with coworkers. Help out the servers around you if you (if you walk out with an iced tea pitcher, offer tea to tables that aren&apos;t yours). Don&apos;t prejudge anyone; some of my best tips have come from guests (not customers)who other servers have told me don&apos;t tip well. Maybe these guests didn&apos;t tip well because servers looked at them and decided they wouldn&apos;t tip well because they were high school kids, or old people, or they looked grungy. I treat everyone as well as I can, and I make great money. And don&apos;t take anything personally. If someone is rude, they might be having a bad day. See if you can make it better by continuing to treat them well. I have had guests apologize to me for being difficult, and then compensating me for being tolerant by tipping me well. Keep your attitude great; it always reflects well on you.

 i have been doing this for a long time....and lets just say that you never really know what kind of tip you are going to get ......most of the time you can do everything right but people are cheap....and no matter how good the service is it is not always reflective in the tip....they leave it on the table and quickly leave.....so you can never look them in the eye and open it to see what they left you....i find that most people are pretty cheap and ten percent is an insult......and if its less than ten percent.....then perhaps you cannot afford to eat out......go to a fast food restaurant....less than ten percent is almost the same as leaving nothing....


all in all.....the best service is not always recognized by the cheap

 When I am dining out, I love it when the waitress manages to come back often to refill my drink. I mainly order tea and if I know the place has good tea that will be my choice of drink. The one thing that annoys me is when there is more ice than tea or not enough ice with the tea. Because when tea is made it is warm and the ice has to help the tea get cold, so if there is not enough ice, the tea will get warmer quicker.

I also love it when a waitress or waiter has a pleasant smile on her or his face EVEN if they are having a bad day. I know waitresses and waiters don&apos;t get paid good and they rely on tips and if that service they provide to me is good I will go past the minimum tip. If I think the service is not up to par I will only tip $1.00 or $2.00...if I think it is good I have tipped $5.00 for a $20.00 order. I am not made of money, but the SERVICE has to be there in order for that person to receive a great tip from me.

 On the first visit to the table, make sure that everything is there, that should be there. Make sure that customers have plenty of rolls on the table, nothing turns me off faster than&quot;no rolls&quot;to finish the rest of the meal.
Don&apos;t wait until a customer has a mouth full of food, then come running up and asking..&quot;You need anything else.?&quot;.. If you see the customer chewing, stay away. That will get the waitress a big tip from me.
I hate to be interrupted too many times. I&apos;m there to EAT, not to answer questions from some dip stick waitress that is too eager to please. Don&apos;t ask if&quot;everything is OK&quot;, because if it isn&apos;t, they will tell you so. When the customer is finished with the meal, and you&apos;re standing close by, tell them,&quot;thanks, hurry back&quot;. Do NOT tell them&quot;Have a nice day&quot;. That is the most stupid, ungodly thing that you can say to a person.
When a person tells me to&quot;Have a Nice day&quot;, I keep my tip money inside my pocket, and never come back.
