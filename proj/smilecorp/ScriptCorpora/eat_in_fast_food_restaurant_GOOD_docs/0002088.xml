Lousville, Kentucky Area Guide

The City of Louisville, the largest city in Kentucky and the county seat of Jefferson County, is located on the Ohio River in north-central Kentucky. The city provides both visitors with world-class amenities like top-notch performing arts, great sports and diverse dining and residents with small-city advantages like shorter commutes and a lower cost of living. Named as America&apos;s &quot;Most Livable&quot; large city by the US Conference of Mayors, Louisville is best known as the location of the Kentucky Derby, the first of three annual thoroughbred horse races making up the Triple Crown. Other attractions include the 4th Street Live! entertainment complex, the Waterfront Park, the Mellwood Arts Center, the Speed Art Museum and the Muhammad Ali Center.
