The White Person’s Guide To Black People, Part 5
 Posted on 08/18/2011 by The Champ 
 

If you happened toeavesdropon a random group of black people having a free-flowing conversation—and this conversation could take place anywhere; a family reunion, a happy hour, a game night, a cafeteria table, wherever—there’s a good chance that the discussion will eventually shift to our feelings about black people doing dumb-ass sh*t in public.

The topic might be something someone saw on the evening news. If at a restaurant, it might revolve around a woman near the entrance who’s dressed and acting a“hot ass mess.”It might just be our hilarious thoughts about the latest episode of Basketball Wives.

While they might seeminnocuous andunnecessary, these frequent conversations about cringe-worthy sh*t committed by people of color all come from the same place, the same latent feeling that’s never actually spoken aloud but understood by each.

 We’d rather not air our“dirty laundry”around white people, and we’re slightly amazed, shocked, and embarrassed by those who do. 

This feeling, passed down to us by our parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, has wide-reaching effects, as it influences the way we act, causes many of us to“ code switch ,”and creates a certain level of collective racial hyper self-consciousness that (I’m assuming) white people never have to adopt.

I realize that many of them (white people) don’t really“get”this way of thinking, not understanding why we’d be pathologicallyreluctantto be candid and let our hair down around them, but a recent experience I’ve had should help them understand why many of us feel the way we do.

A couple weeks ago, Lisa Hickey—publisher and CEO of Good Men Media—asked if I’d be interested writing something for an upcoming discussion of race at The Good Men Project. Now, this wasn’t an out of the blue request. I’ve written for The Good Men Project before, and Lisa and I exchange emails regularly and have a pretty good working relationship.

But while I was definitely interested in contributing, I had a major mental reservation: I’d never written about race for a (predominately) white audience before. 

Yes, I’m aware that VSB has a large and multi-racial readership base. But, the majority of the people who frequent here belong to the same demographic (21 to 35 year old African-American), and that knowledge does influence word choice and tone. I might be a bit more conscious of some of the things I so freely discuss here if I knew I was speaking to a different audience.

Anyway, I got past the reservation and ended up writing a 1000 word piece about a“ racial neurosis ”that many of us carry, and how it affects the way we react to things.
 
 “The overt and soul-crippling racism that plagued our parents and grandparents isnt nearly as prominent today. Anyone whod argue otherwise is a fool. But, this history has resulted in a collective neurosis whose symptoms are similar to how dealing with a crazy girlfriend or boyfriend for too long starts to make you crazy as well. You start hacking intotheir email account just to make sure they havent hacked into yours again. They accuse you of lying so much that you start to wonder Wait, am I sure that happened? Did I really go to work today, or did I spend the entire day with my mistress? 

 From a race perspective, a manifestation of this mindset is you wondering if all things that happen to you are somehow related to you being black; a too heightened racial awareness that makes it increasingly difficult to discern between legitimate racism and race-based discrimination both of whichdefinitely still exist and mere happenstance.” 
 
I ended this essay with a paragraph or two about what often happens when we eat at restaurants.As many of you know, we have a stereotype of being bad tippers. This reputation may or may not be deserved, but I theorized that we might be bad tippers because we have a history of getting bad service, so we anticipate it now. I called thisphenomenon“ Eating While Black ,”andLisa liked that term so much that she thought I should just make it the title of the article. I agreed.

 “Eating While Black” was eventually published last Monday, and it was pretty well-received; ending the week as the 3rd most popular article at The Good Men Project that week. The comments it generated didn’t really touch on the racial neurosis aspect, though, as most were focused on why Eating While Black occurs.

One commentator in particular—a guy who went by G.L. Piggy—shared a few of his thoughts as a whitewaiterwho’s had many experiences with black customers.
 
 “Ive been a waiter for 7 years at a second-tier Italian restaurant. In my experience, black do tip worse. Yes, white servers cringe when they see black people being seated at their tables. But the same is true of black servers as well. This has much less to do with the amount of the tip one is expected to receive though. 

 These are all generalities not all black people are like this. But racial differences in restaurant behavior are noticable. Black people tend to be more needy, pickier, and quick to anger. They take much longer to order their food. We call it being ran. Many servers get the feeling that black patrons are asking for extra things napkins, ranch dressing, extra sauce just to put us to work. They seem much less understanding about your time constraints and your need to take care of your other patrons. There seems to be, among blacks more than other races, a mentality of I want it now. And while the get shit for free mentality transcends race, blacks tend to hold it more than other races of people” 
 
Although I found the statement about black people and“getting shit for free”a little troubling, I appreciated his candor and willingness to share his opinions. We went back and forth a few times after that, cordially debating the root causes of Eating While Black, and the discussion eventually died down towards the end of the week.

This Monday, however, I received an email notification that“Eating While Black”had received another trackback. I clicked on it, and it took me to“ Not Tipping While Black ”—a 600 word long response G.L. Piggy’s hadjust posted on his blog.

I read it, expecting to see a continuation of the discussion we had the week before. Instead, I noticed a shift in tone and direction, as itsubtlystarted to become a critique of“black culture”in general.
 
 “But it is ridiculous to grant poor tippers some sort of deep philosophicaljustification for their cheapness and/or hostility towards(white) social norms of any sort. The fact is that tipping is an American norm which means that black patrons who willingly flout itare free-riding on the rest of society.” 
 
Curious where this discussion was headed, I decided to stick around and read the comments.

Damn.

From G.L. Piggy:
 
 “But whenever they find hairs or plastic (at an amazingly high rate) or if their food isnt prepared to their liking, you pretty much have to drop everything to cater to them. Its really like waiting on infants” 
 
From“a.nonny.mous”
 
 “…black patrons of restaurants arent oriented to the bill for their food, literally because their minds have trouble conceiving it. So they get it and areastounded because they never thought how will this steak and wine affect my future bank account in a way a non-black would.” 
 
From“EzE”
 
 “Really, is it necessary to plumb the depths of evolutionary psychology to figure out why blacks are lousy tippers, rude customers? Do you really think that some alleged inability to consider future consequences comes into play? 

 Blacks are jerks, thats all. Theres no need to science it all up. Also the infantile mind theory is no good, theyre not infants, they are of below average intelligence often but above retardation. No, theres no big mystery here, theyre just jerks is all.” 
 
These are just a few of the 130 or so comments this topic generated, but they provide a good snapshot of the tone of the entire discussion there. What’s jarring (and kind of scary) is the fact that these don’t seem to be unintelligent people. These aren’t your stereotypical uneducatedtrailerpark racist rednecks. Most of them live in major cities, they each have well thought out and“researched”theories about why blacks are intellectually inferior, and they seem to be mentally, intellectually, and emotionally invested in proving this to be true.

Ironically, the comments in“ Not Tipping While Black” actually prove why Eating While Black even exists. While they interpret our“pickiness”and occasional animosity towards servers as entitlement, it’s really just distrust—distrust of whiteestablishments, distrust of the food made by white cooks, distrust of white people’s ultimate intentions, etc—and statements like this“… black patrons of restaurants arent oriented to the bill for their food, literally because their minds have trouble conceiving it.” do nothing but fan that flame.

Anyway, I’m pointing all of this out because this is the exact reason why I—and many other black people—have serious reservations about being candid around most whites.Yes, I realize that not all white people share these views. But more than enough of us share the belief that deep down, many of them do.

And, thereluctanceto freely share, to be open and honest, to“ air our dirty laundry in public ”is basically just us not wanting to provide any opportunity for white America to gather more“evidence”to support their latent belief that we’re just not supposed to be here.

Strangely enough, this experience didn’t depress or dishearten me in the least. Maybe I just anticipated it and braced myself for it. And, maybe the“ losing sleep over what white assholes think ”part of my brain is underdeveloped too.

 *removes his mask* 

First off, I want to apologize because I did not realize the gravitas of this post: I commented before I read. That being done, let us dissect your post.

A few years ago, I read about the racist letters that Hank Aaron received leading up to his breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record ( http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00006764.html ). The letter excerpt that struck me most was the one that said, “How about some sickle cell anemia, Hank?” This excerpt implies that educated White people were expressing substantive racist sentiments because of a baseball record . On top of that, most of the racist letters were postmarked in Northern cities. 

 Incidentally , my top comment quotes were from the film“City of God,”in which the protagonist Rocket is hyper-conscious of the Rio de Janeiro slum where he lives and how outsiders can lump him together with the locale’s thugs. And, similarly, African-American people have to be hyper-conscious of other races’perceptions of all people of African descent (AA’s, Haitians, Somalians, Sudanese, Nigerians, etc.). 

Champ, I feel conflicted about whether your post belongs on the site. It is akin to one of those times on“Fresh Prince of Bel Air”where the family encounters racism and the show has a serious moment. It is jarring and is a significant mood shift for a site dedicated to pointing out the comedy of dating and relationships. But as a Black man, I recognize this post’s necessity.

 *puts mask back on* 

I am headed outside for a walk…errr…an evil walk. Yes, precisely. Cheers.

This has me thinking about what Frantz Fanon (in convo with Sartre) said I’m The Wretched of the Earth where a colonized person has to constantly be aware of his image and jealously protect his position. The defenses of those colonized“are tuned like anxious antennae waiting to pick up the hostile signals of a racially divided world.”the result is the acquisition of a“peculiar visceral intelligence dedicated to the survival of the body and spirit”.

Nowadays we may call this gift a special“neurosis”as Champ describes. I just call them“Spidey-Senses”or“Extra-Sensory BullSh*t Perception”…

eu falo tambem.. y hablo espanol.. aussi un petit peu de fracaise

but what i wanted to say.. have people finally given up the thought that we are in a post-racial colorblind society since the sun has set on colonialism and the US elected a biracial president? i think the multicultural rioting in the UK and the discussions about it in the aftermath and the emergence of the“take our country back”rhetoric of the tea-party combined with the increasingly racist and vitriolic commentary on ordinary message boards as well as shootings in norway etc. all serve as proof the zenophobia and racism that has always existed has not diminished. as the lines of class and geography blur due increased global mobility and the presence of minimum human rights laws which prevent overt acts of discrimination, people are in closer quarters and there are more mediums by which to anonymously share abhorrent views. just because things change on the law books, doesnt mean that peoples views have changed. you cannot legislate people’s hearts and minds.

i think the reluctance to“not air the dirty laundry”comes from a place of sensitivity to the likely reality that we would be fanning the embers of other people’s pre-existing negative views as can be seen in the example above, where when commenter takes a post about bill paying and extrapolates a view on an entire groups intellect.

As a person born and bred in RSA this resonates deeply within me that the constant struggle our country has is not the law that changes to accomodate everyone;s basic human rights but the fight to change ppls hearts and minds. Anything that happens in our country whether it be sports, politics, crime, corruption, murder, Nelson Mandel, animal cruelty will eventually one way or another turn into a race argument/debate/blame game scenario. It irks me to no end, I feel as if maybe, we all fought it out, we would all mello the f@ck out and focus on nation building.

 Boron adorns himself with a bubu/agbada and approaches the podium. 

Chale o! Let me go tell you dat dey should be no distinction between Africans and the people of the diaspora, o! And consequently, dey were two choices for my last comment: 1) Call all Blacks“people of African descent”2) Call dem“Africans!”

Granted, it would be more empowering to call Haitians and other people groups of the diaspora“Africans,”but it might have been more confusing to readers.

If you created a Venn diagram of the relationship between“Africans”and“People of African Descent,”the latter would be a subset of the former: in a literal sense, “of African descent”just indicates that one is descended from Africans. Clearly all (Black) Africans are. Nigerians are Africans but dey are also of African descent, o! But, as the great Negromancer, I prevent Blacks from realizing that they would benefit from considering“African”and“African descent”to be one and the same! 

Of course, I barely am surprised by your comment, o! I am just intrigued dat you did not write“Just so that you know, Africa is Nigeria!” Nigerians are liable to be so presumptuous! 

I am Boron el Amin Sese Seko! I am Oba over all that I survey! Ah ha ha ha ha!

I think any form of racism is uncomfortable. I’m from a“purple”state, but its divided mostly north/south. I don’t like any form of racism, but I like being protected by the fact that someone can’t make their racism clear. This way I don’t have to feel uncomfortable.

I think we also live in a different time, so when people say they like their racism“straight up”it does come from the privileged point of view because we live in the now. NOW racism is latent and those who are overtly racist are often on the margins. Yet, if it was socially acceptable to racist like it once was then we would all feel a lot differently.

Laten racism is like the roots of a tree. To make sure racism never comes back in America the roots need to be uplifted altogether. I don’t think we should have to settle.

Each race/culture/social group as well as individual in such have an intrinsic bias as basic as DNA, it will never be any different. What many call‘Racism’has actually become a Poli-Correct tool to marginalize other groups/individual preferences in order to gain an advantage…..in this country the term‘racist’has become nothing but an identifier of those who have nor ability to defend their own arguments and seek to further disadvantage others.

You hit the nail right on the head. Many of the comments the Champ cited did not surprise me at all because being a white person, I’ve heard them a million times before. And as Champ pointed out, this type of thinking is not restricted to the lower classes. Not at ALL. I hear it a lot less now, I believe, because I have 2 bi-racial children and there are fewer people that make the mistake of thinking I am“safe”company.

The bottom line is that racial biases such as these are not based on logical, factual or common-sense deductions. No matter how many times racist, hateful statements are proven false, the person that holds those views will continue to cling to them. They will assign bizarre motivations and characterizations to their targets and not be deterred. I have had people assign“trailer park”characteristics to me because I have children witha black man…despite the fact that they know well my middle class background, moral standards and ivy league education.

Racism is like a mental illness. You can’t understand it because it makes no sense. You just have to know that the problem is theirs; not yours, and keep it movin’. But I know I’m preaching to the choir lol

That was a very reflective post. And I think that the racial neurosis that you described is VERY real. I am living it right now. I just graduated from NC A&amp;T (Can I get an Aggie Pride?!?) but now I am taking classes at a predominately White institution. I am finding it hard to hold my tongue and represent my race simultaneously. I do not want myths to be perpetuated as the teacher talks ignorantly about things such as“Black English”a term that makes me cringe, but I also dont want to be seen as the Black girl who is speaking from emotion instead of researched academics. Much like the ignorant people on that post. The problem remains when the research is just as biased as peoples thoughts. And the Black people tipping thing is like the chicken or the egg, which came first.

Eh, what are the poor coloreds to do?

Also according to my sister, unfortunately, like Piggy said, most of these customers tend to be black.

I got some plain truth. As I mentioned before it seems that most complaints come from the plate jockeys at psuedo-restaurants. To expect tips for such service is a slap in the face to real wait staff at real restaurants where great service and pride in the food is the default. What annoys me are the sweeping conclusions certain plate jockeys are making about a race’s intellectual capacity and character based on something they don’t even technically deserve. I always tip just 20% at these places out of charity. 5 to 10 bucks is all I need to pay to have someone assume I’m intelligent and a good citizen? Nice. Try not to spend it all in one place.

Oh, how I wish that were true. Anyone who feels they haven’t received“great”service will do everything in their power to get out of paying their bill. Even at chain restaurants (I used to work @ Friday’s) some people will find anything wrong w/the service and/or food to get money knocked off the bill. Cheap people are cheap people and it doesn’t matter if you served them while tap dancing w/the damn food on your head, if they don’t wanna pay, they’ll find a way out of it.

ummmm WOW..okay..ummm

First of all let me start by saying I have worked in food service for a time in college. I worked at Buffalo Wild Wings—this is important because they are/were known for their 30 cent wings on Tuesday nights…anyway…it would be all good until lets 8ish 9ish..when a packs of ninjas would descend on B-dubs..and even I ( a black woman) would cringe…

They would sit 10 deep at a table built for 4 and be trifling and order like 3 wings..and a water..with lemon and sugar on the side…then they would proceed to sit at this table (on the busiest night) for hours..taking up space…and still ordering 3 wings at a time to still be“paying customers”…when they did leave the tip would be around $2…$5 if they was feeling generous..

Now…i said that to say this…YES some black people are bad tippers..I have a friend who never goes over $2 regardless of the service..

But not all are bad tippers..and not all act this way…

But where the servers get it wrong is, they think we HAVE to tip…

When in actuality all we got to do is stay black and die

The thing is…in our minds we have to do a lot of ish that we don’t want to do…namely at our job…but we do it because thats our job…

We know servers only get paid 2.13 an hour…but so did they when they got hired on…

Tips are a perk not a right

What i have found is that servers feel a sense of entitlement BECAUSE THEY know YOU know what they make an hour…
yet if your service isn’t to my liking I don’t have to pay you ish…

Black people are notorious for callin others out on their BS…and food service is not different.

Exactly! I used to catch a lot of flack from my bougie black friends about this belief, but at the end of the day your service should decide your tip (and they say we’re the ones with the sense of entitlement lol). If you want a black person to tip you and not feel guilty about it being a minuscule amount then you need to be friendly as hell, funny as hell, and or helpful and attentive as hell otherwise I don’t know you so I don’t feel like I owe you (even if I did, you better give me more than bare minimum service if you want more than a bare minimum tip).

Also, I worked at a restaurant for a brief moment and it was one of those ritzy steakhouses. I busted my ass for a table of TEN needy and rich white folks (some of which were European). How do I know they were rich? Because their tab ended up being about $450. They ordered all kinds of alcoholic beverages, desserts, and the likes. I was attentive as hell and very friendly. They took up the majority of my time and energy and then at the end they held a bs grudge because I mixed up someone’s dessert and guess what they tipped me? NADA! Those trifling f*ckers didn’t give me a DAMN thing. And they sat there for at least an hour and a half. It’s not just black people, but we do have a reputation for this type of behavior

I agree Justmetheguy about the Euro non-tipping bit. But isn’t it commonplace for them NOT to tip? Not making excuses but I’ve heard from a few white co-workers and my one white friend who have frequented Europe often that tipping isn’t a necessity over there..

I could be wrong.

But when i go out to eat I ALWAYS tip nothing less than 15% (of course based on service) I keep my little tip calculator on my phone just to make sure that I do leave enough. But I also go to the same restaurant most of the time and try to get the same server (who always remembers that I like Sierra mist, my mom likes regular coffee, and my baby likes apple juice, crayons and a coloring sheet..shouts out to KC lol)

I think the United States is the only country that does tip. Servers in other countries around the world make living wages, so they don’t rely on tips to supplement their income. So Americans on vacation are great for them, but when non-Americans visit us, it doesn’t work out as well. Just differences in social norms (that stem from differences in governmental and economic practices).

In Europe, the tip is included into the bill at many spots. So, if you do tip, you are tipping twice. For some Euros when they eat in the states, they assume the tip is included like back home.
For some people, they just don’t know the rules of tipping. My sister would tip $5 regardless of the bill. She just didn’t know. We didn’t have the luxury of being nosy and asking the parents why they leave extra money unlike white families who may frequent restaurants more.
I worked as a server for a bit and did notice that my black peoples tended to work me more. I chalk it up to them thinking,“if I am gonna tip, i am gonna make sure he deserves it.

Race V Class V Social Norms

Yes we ( Europeans), dont tip. It’s very true. Service in inculded in everything. So regardless if you like the service or spilt halfway, you pay that percentage. Some American styled shops and stores have that customer service feedback, where you can pay an addtional service, but you end up paying twice anyway, so yes you feel double robbed ( and you only drop into those establishments when it’s payday). Europeans we don’t like to be vocal about bad service there and then. We stage that silent protest instead, with our feet and our wallets.

I find when I visit the states, your EXPECTED to contribute to the norms. But if I get bad service I won’t contribute. This rarely happens as once you hear an accent, service gets real good, I mean hand over foot good. So I’ll pay the 10%-12% in service. Our taxes are high and for me to spend a few pounds is murder on the dancefloor.

I do find it intresting how us Europeans are viewed as‘tight fisted’, like you see/hear us and know we are no good. If you could see a list of our everyday houshold bills next to our taxes, and compare to your own, you might a little sympthy to our social graces.

AMEN! In Europe no one ever expected a tip. The same for my Latin American excursions. I have long thought“tipping”was an American invention.

That being said, I am not a great tipper, blame it on my culture. When I go out, I don’t feel the need to tip because its your job to get my order right and smile and all that other ish. I have a friend who tips everyone: her waxer, manicurist, the Asian lady that tweezes her unibrow, alladem. I’ve seen the reluctance on others faces when they don’t know if they should accept the money. She doesn’t tip because the service was good but because its says something about her status. Tipping greatly doesn’t mean you are a good person and not tipping doesn’t mean you are bad in my book.

Its all just how we’ve been socialized to think and act.

I’m a lurker but this post hit so close to home that I had to reply.

Until a few days ago I, being african, hated the (american concept of the) tip. I never quite understood the logic behind accepting a job that pays 2.50 and expecting to supplement that income by turning an optional monetary gesture for exceptional service into an entitlement.

Then I went on vacation with my father who lives in africa, is very picky and can run up a tab. For example, he only drinks room temperature water and asked the wait staff to open 15+ yr old bottles of wine (the cork will always break save for a special opener that requires some skill to operate). Thing is, he always tips over 20% and sometimes slips our personal waiter an lil extra.
I noticed that the waiters were all smiles at the end of the night, remembered us whenever we returned and made an extra effort to cater to our picky needs, and never seemed to mind that we took our time at the restaurants (we were always the last to leave).
Moreover, when I asked my dad why he tipped so large, he said that it was because of the precedent that a large tip sets and so that when the next black patrons shows up, the wait staff are more open to catering to their needs because of his actions.

I think that what he was getting at/trying to teach me is that because of the warped nature that is tipping in the US, the potential benefits of tipping well (which i define arbitrarily to be over 20%) as a black patron is more advantageous than not, because of what it reflects. (the wait staff at the resort began sending up our favorite deserts every afternoon, no charge)

just me the guy:

you proved my point. i’m not saying that the tipping norms are perfect. i’ve written posts on my own blog about how servers have a sense of entitlement that piss me off. a lot of servers are crybabies.

but i find a pattern of black people taking it upon themselves to reshape social norms (which tipping is) just because they think they don’t have to play by those rules. white patrons don’t“know me or owe me”either, but they still stick to the 15% norm, in general.

so what i see here is that blacks, as you intonate, don’t think that they need to play by these rules but then expect there to be no backlash from such behavior. as i commented at The Champ’s post on GMP, black people seem to want 15% service for a 5% price.

“but blacks or anyone else who flouts social norms cannot then expect to receive equal treatment from society at large.”

Funny thing is, the social norms themselves are largely what deny us equal treatment from society at large (thinking more big picture here). You’re acting like true equal treatment was/is feasible for us in the first place, which we have no reason to believe if things continue the way they have been since we got here. Yes, oppression has been“outlawed,”but it exists structurally because changing laws don’t change people, and people still are afraid of and hate brown skin (if you need evidence of this, start with the comments on your own blog). According to what you said, we can’t win; either we participate in our own oppression by going along with the norms of a society that was (and still is) structured to deny us opportunity, or we fight it and still get denied. Just offering a little perspective here, in case you give a damn.

I won’t be around much today, but hopefully someone can pick up where I’m leaving off if there’s a response. Hold me down, black people.

The problem with the statement is that you have put whites as the head of the table and all other parties at the children’s table. All parties want a seat at the American table since that’s how we market ourselves to the world. I cringe at the thought that some“White council”gets to choose what elements from other cultures gets to be included as a norm in the social fabric.

“this is the same as black parents naming their kid Javonte or some other ethnic sounding name”

I guess the rules don’t apply here when Whites name their kids Apple, Brooklyn, or Dweezil? I forgot Whites make the rules/norms so they will get a pass.

There’s so much wrong with what you’ve written I don’t even know where to to start. Listen to yourself,“black people want to have an equal stake in white society”. So if we follow you’re line of reasoning, black people should name our children Bob, or Sam or Jane, tip 15% or more, walk and talk as white people do because it’s their society after all and maybe just maybe then we can have a stake in YOUR society. Is that right? Well, we did that or at least tried to in the 50s and 60s and people got hosed and killed and blocked from sitting in restaurants and riding buses. This is isn’t white society. That’s your first fault. Black people have a problem withs some white people because you all see everything from your vantage point only and assume that’s the only perspective there is or that matters. It’s how we fit into your world not the other way around or even (gasp) that we may all just be fitting into a world or society that belong to both our races and others as well. Some black people are poor tippers and rude at restaurants because some black people have issues. But some other black people go to restaurants are not rude and are not poor tippers. Some black people just want to have a night and meal out without having to deal with the weight of other people’s racism, ignorance or displaced blame because the table of black people you served before me didn’t tip you. Because I’m sure didn’t hold it against a group of white people when a table of white people you served previously didn’t tip. Only black people are accountable for the actions of all other black people. But you’re knowledgeable, educated, intelligent, right. You wouldn’t make wide-sweeping generalizations.

Ok, so first of all G.L. Piggy, to be clear, I now do tip 15% by default. Before that I grew up in a majority black environment and didn’t know ANYBODY who worked in a restaurant so I had NO IDEA that it was supposed to be 15%. Didn’t even hear about that number until I got to college (hence me referring to the people who told me about this as“bougie black folks”). I fussed about that because I felt like that was such an arbitrary # and I thought my friends had made that crap up. After a while though, I used my reasoning and realized that even though I’m the type of customer that doesn’t ask for anything extra AT ALL (except for a water refill and for the waiter to check on me every 10 minutes or so), $2.35/hour is a tough way to spend your hours, so NOW I do tip 15% by default (if there are no problems) and if service is exceptional (and I have extra cash) I’ll give them as much as 18%. So my post was really more indicative of my initial feelings. I’m 25 now. When I felt that way I was like 19 lol. I also think my time being a server changed my perspective. (Read my story about that large party that was mixed between Caucasian Americans and Caucasian Europeans)

If only white people could spend a few years being black (the way I spent time being a server at a restaurant) I think they’d stop making ignorant and racist comments (such as the ones Champ highlighted that if I’m not mistaking YOU made) that come off as insecure and hateful, but that’s a whole different topic.

And to respond to this:
”so what i see here is that blacks, as you intonate, dont think that they need to play by these rules but then expect there to be no backlash from such behavior.”

So you’re saying servers have the right to punish the next black family they see for the last 3 families’behaviors? If so I hope never woman ever lies to you or cheats on you. Cause no other chick that meets you will be safe.

Thats a management issue…for any table with 6 to 8 or more depending on how your kitchen turns you should get an automatic 18% gratuity add if the average bill is more than $45 a head.

Because you arent going to turn a 10 top quickly and you only get so many tables per shift anyway, even if you are slammed, large groups get priority.

So most places in Chicago charge an automatic gratuity for groups of 10 or more at the minimum regardless of price per head…

Did this happen often?

Also most places, especially those that have a high European clientele have to have a gratuity add because they dont tip in Europe…so unless they were well versed in American travel they probably didnt know any better.

I am really sorry that happened to you because a table like that can kill your vibe all night

I tip by Olympic judging rules. Every waiter starts off with a 10 which equals 20%. Deductions are made if he/she are not on their game. Such as if I have to wait for a refill of wait on them to take my order when the place is not full. I have no problem putting the dollar in the water glass full of water to make my point.

I’ve had so many ethnic tables including Europeans, not just black tell me I gave them awesome service and they were going to request to sit in my sect and all of that then I pick up the book and there $5 on $80. For people like that, it’s just plain ignorance. There’s no excuse, just like receiving tips is a perk going out to eat and being served is a perk…not a right! If you decide to go out to eat you need be able to pay for the full experience including the tip if you’re server did a good job. Plain and simple….

First, I think it is extremely interesting that the few black people here who have actually been servers back up the point of my post.

Second, I have not stated anywhere that I am entitled to a tip. It’s not even about the tip. This may sound weird, but when I get stiffed I don’t even get mad. I am actually happy that I am reminded that I am not as big a piece of shit as the person who stiffed me (all races stiff, but blacks tend to stiff more often). It’s about the utter lack of awareness that I (or other servers) are working and that we have other people to serve and that the world doesn’t revolve around one particular table/patron. IMO and through my observation, blacks, on average, don’t either realize that this is the case or they don’t care.

At the end of it all, I’m trying to figure out why what seems to me to be a large enough % of the black population to merit notice behave outside of social norms. Part of it is ignorance about tipping and restaurant behavior, fine. But some of it is about having a chip on their shoulder or not caring about behaving pro-socially or about wanting to fuck over someone who is either white or who is associated with a white-run establishment.

So it is my belief that it is black patrons who’ve created their own so-called downfall here. A pattern which I believe holds true in other facets of life too. But that’s another discussion.

I wonder based on your comment here if you realize the non-verbals you are portraying if you have this perception when you approach a table with black patrons. I dine out 5 out of the 7 days a week and I can usually tell who thinks there is going to be a problem and who doesn’t. I normally frequent the establishments who don’t see me as an issue and sit in the area of the wait staff I adore! I get freebies because they love me not because I’m complaining!

Agreed! A group of friends and I meet for dinner at different establishments on a regular basis–we can always tell which servers don’t want to be bothered with us. They give us poor service and in turn we tip poorly. A vicious cycle to be sure. If they, over the course of the evening, adjust their attitudes toward us we tip quite generously.

I waited tables for a little over a year in college and have a tendency to over-tip. However, I refuse to tip well for piss poor service just to“prove”to the server, whites, anybody in the vicinity…that I know how to tip. You show me you know how to wait tables, I’ll show you I know how to tip.

Sir,

The problem with you argument(s) is the generalization. It would make more sense if you said the black people who frequent my restaurant OR the black people in my area…but to say in your words“…through my observation, blacks, on average, dont either realize that this is the case or they dont care”is unfair, unwarranted, and unsubstantiated…

As I said above thread I live in the South where the bad tippers and complainers are WHITE people. In my experience, white people tend to expect a certain level of perfection in regards to service (as they should, i mean they are paying)….however, they have been also quick to complain, ask for food to be comped, bypass the server and complain directly to the manager…in a passive aggressiveness that is uncanny and annoying–especially when matters can be resolved without the fanfare…

As I said before black are more vocal (in my experience), which makes them more visibly seen complaining…

but at the end of the day we are all AMERICANS who (especially in this economy) can’t and won’t spend money on ANYTHING that is unsatisfactory…including services

we hash and rehash..why black people do this or that or why white people do this or that…but your experience will always be your experience..and mine will be mine

Causal Oversimplication? Is that the order of the day? There is one and only one cause for an effect (in this case utter lack of awareness that world doesn’t revolve around one particular table is the cause for black people tipping behavior). This is your earnest academic theory? Serious question: Have you considered the (good) possibility that you might be projecting here? That your premise is based more on an internal animus/bias than actual reality? I only ask because you are making numerous generalizations and employing some fairly untenable logic in an attempt to make a point (which also turned out to be a generalization). Some food for thought perhaps.

I usually tip 20%. If the service was really good, I tip 25%. If it was bad, I tip the regular 15%. Never do I go below 15%, and I have never walked out without tipping a server in my life. Other black friends of mine have a similar tipping system.

Now what?

Clearly you are not a statistician of any sort. Based on the scenario you outlined, here is the conclusion you can draw (which while more accurate is still not mathematically sound):

Half of blacks tip higher than average, half of blacks tip lower than average. Hmm. . . I don’t think I need to explain how this is the definition of the word average. Moving on

Of the blacks and whites who tip higher than average, blacks tip higher than whites.

Of the blacks and whites who tip lower than average, whites tip higher than blacks.

Strange we are not having a discussion about these conclusions.

First of all, you’re awesome.
Secondly, though, I waited and bartended for 12 years, and every waiter knows a good tipper, whatever the color. You broadcast it with subtle cues that reflect your comfort level in a restaurant.
One of the things that disturbs me about these conversations is the whole“black people are like this”aspect. I grew up in a black neighborhood and live in a majority black city and that sort of statement often confuses me because I always seem to be imagining a different black person in my mind than the black person being imagined by whoever is talking to me.
That being said, I’ve dealt with demanding and low-tipping black people in my previous work, but it was always more important to me to maintain my groove than to start trying to adjust my level of service per customer. I wanted everything to be perfect, and you can’t do that if you start getting mad or resentful at your tables. I felt the same way when I moved away for a few years and worked in Florida (old people) and Alabama (rednecks).

So, I read the study quoted in your article. 1. Michael Lynn does not make any claims as to why Black people tend to tip less, but he says this is what comes up in the findings. He controls for socio-economic class. 2. The data was collected mostly through surveys and he references a study he did with patrons from iHop. Some people may tip differently based on where they go to eat.

I think these are significant things to consider in determining whether race is a statistically significant factor in determining how someone will tip. I am not disputing Lynn’s claims, but I would take such studies with a grain of salt.

And then this,“So it is my belief that it is black patrons whove created their own so-called downfall here. A pattern which I believe holds true in other facets of life too. But thats another discussion.”

I have a comment in moderation where I wondered the same thing.

Because while some…especially those who have been servers before may tip a set percentage across the board or a set dollar amount…others, especially those who frequent chain restaurants where there maybe a perceived lower value of service.

i.e. when you go to IHOP they bring you a carafe of coffee, rather than doing refills by hand or preparing a pressed pot table side.

Because most are going to find more value in table side guacamole prep vs someone having to run to back to the kitchen to bring them a scoop of guacamole from a jar in a little plastic cup. ~JS

Though I have received bad tips from black patrons after providing excellent service I would not go as far as to say they are worse than any other race. I live in LA and I had a latin table yesterday that left me $2 on $50. There are A LOT of Latin people that tip bad there are A LOT of Europeans that tip bad there are A LOT of Asians that tip bad. I will go as far as to say I’ve received just as many bad tips from these racial groups as I have with Black tables. Like a couple said before in the South there are A LOT of White people that tip bad. I worked in Indiana and Kentucky where I’m from and majority of people black, white, whatever tipped horribly. I’ve served in four different states and what I’ve learned is that people tip bad everywhere no matter what their race is. I understand your frustration b/c believe me I get frustrated too and start thinking hateful thoughts but you can’t fall to that level of ignorance. No one will want to hear you out when you come with ignorance it just makes people defensive and after that you’ve lost your point. You sound like an angry person that’s clearly trying to vent b/c everything you’re saying has no fact base or merit. It’s all just opinion…a very jaded opinion to say the least.

Im wondering where you actually work…because it sounds like you work at a chain establishment like Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, etc…

Otherwise I cant understand the type of behavior you describe being a pain…like extra ranch, really…unless you work in a place that has a template menu and a certain type of ordering system where your tickets will get backed up if you have to stop and get ranch.

I also ask because Im trying to figure out what you consider 2nd tier…like what is the average tab per head w/o alcohol…and what would you consider a good percentage on a check…15%, 20%

Because WHERE you work will greatly influence how you are tipped…and you mentioned being stiffed frequently across the board but in higher numbers by black patrons.

It sounds like you are working shifts with the after church crowd and a lot of families with lots of kids on a budget…and you might be a biased and making assumptions because most servers know that those groups are difficult regardless of race.

Or you are really new…and venting.

Seriously dude…if youve been in the game any amount of time, you should know that if youre working in a joint that has coupons in the Sunday paper your odds of getting low tips or not getting tips goes up exponentially.

Also did it ever occur to you that it might just be you…because I have been a server before and worked shifts where I made money and others didnt and blamed their tables, instead of their attitudes.

Im just saying that you might be getting back what you are putting out ~JS

This almost seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the outset, I have no objective evidence to support this proposition, but I wonder if the service black people receive is subpar because of an assumption they will be difficult or won’t tip sufficiently. It seems, based on your article and comments thus far, that you and your serving counterparts cringe at the sight of black people being seated in your area. As Champ has alluded to, Black people tend to be sensitive to a difference in service compared with other ethnic groups (read: white people). Theories/Opinions/etc. such as the one you and (some) others hold are rarely completely true. My guess is the reality falls somewhere in the middle.

Nope, that theory doesn’t hold up because they do it at black-run establishments too. Try again.

”A pattern which I believe holds true in other facets of life too.”
Of course you do. You’ve never had to be black, and many people who are given media platforms have supported this theory. I won’t say it’s entirely untrue, but you guys exaggerate it because it justifies you being a racist prick who feels that your culture and even your biology is superior.

If as you claim, the tipping experience is universal among servers, then this conjecture must be wrong:

 But some of it is about having a chip on their shoulder or not caring about behaving pro-socially or about wanting to fuck over someone who is either white or who is associated with a white-run establishment. 

Because in the universe of servers, there are blacks and whites. In the universe of eating establishments, there are ones owned by blacks and whites. If both face equivalent behavior, then the motivations for that behavior have little to do with the current server being black or white or the current establishment being black owned or white owned.
 Reply ↓ Sweet Sass on 08/20/2011 at 1:00 pm said: 
You’re probably giving shitty service with your stinky attitude. You deserve not to be tipped. If you don’t think that we can tell how you are thinking, through nonverbal cues, you are mightily mistaken.

If a white server comes at me haughty, purposefully slow, purposefully gives bad service anticipating a bad tip. I will oblige him.

I normally tip 20%. FYI.

I’ve actually have experience more where outrageous behavior on the part of servers. Multiple service, esp. bartenders…have had them steal their own tips. All of them have been white. I guess white people are anti-social thieves. See how your logic works?

 JAH on 08/18/2011 at 2:19 am said: 
I agree with your assessment that tips are not a right, but are earned for good service. In fact, TIPS means: To Insure Prompt Service and were given at the beginning of the meal so that food would be brought out quickly and people who tipped more, got better service.
I live in WA state where servers make a minimum wage (currently $8.67) and often even more than that. However, we (the patrons) are still expected to tip for service out of social norms. I have worked numerous minimum wage jobs and never got paid extra for doing MY JOB. Now, I understand that in many parts of the country, servers do get paid low wages to account for tips and at that point I would gladly pay a little extra if the service was good.

I agree that tipping should be reserved for good service and that people shouldn’t be guilted into paying extra for their meal.

In some countries (like Canada), tipping is included as part of the tax but in many countries the concept of tipping doesn’t even exist.

Yeah I’m wit you Jah. Growing up I assumed servers made the same as any other unskilled job. I don’t tip the people bustin their asses working at McDonald’s so I thought tipping at sit down restaurants was optional. I didn’t know that servers made like a third of what other unskilled workers made. Once I knew better I did better. Everything doesn’t come down to feeling entitled or having a chip on your shoulder. Again it’s just convenient to think that when you wanna be an insecure racist prick. However black people do come with a lot of baggage and are so used to getting f*cked over by capitalists (not just in restaurants) that we tend to be a lil paranoid and cold to people who are trying to convince us to pay them (especially when we’re already paying full price for something). Stop and at least TRY to put yourself in someone’s shoes before you go and try to confirm some Fox News theory my dude

@Imani- Not all of us know this though (the 2.13/ hour). I’m with you for the most part, but I’m not so cold about it anymore because I also know that some sort of tip is expected unless the service was bad (not just mediocre) so I wouldn’t go that far. Cause as a former server I would counter that customers know that a tip is expected when they decide to eat at a sit down restaurant. That’s why when I’m broke I don’t go to sit-down restaurants. My ex and I would make it a point to call-in as opposed to sitting down to eat (if we just had to have their food and didn’t feel like cooking) when we didn’t feel like tipping. Just thought I’d point that out. I agree though, no server’s entitled to a tip. Life sucks. It’s a hard knock life for certain people in certain situations.

SN: I think it’s funny to see a white person getting accused of feeling entitled even though they consider themselves to be working hard. I’m sure he never stopped to observe the similarities between that accusation and the one he keeps hurling at a whole race of people when making his blanket generalizations about us, smh lol

The Ten Eternal Truths of White Nationalism

By: Curt Dietrich

1. A White Nationalist places their race above all and makes any and all sacrifices necessary to further the cause of White Nationalism and the advancement of our people.

2. A White Nationalist does all they can to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.

3. A White Nationalist takes pride in the history, cultures, values, morals, and accomplishments of their people and live by those standards set by our ancestors.

4. A White Nationalist strives to exemplify class, strong character, and a standard of excellence at all times so that they never let their people down.

5. A White Nationalist cultivates camaraderie and fosters unity amongst our people for we will triumph together as one or we shall perish alone.

6. A White Nationalist thinks before they act so that they do not bring shame, harm, or disgrace to their self or our people.

7. A White Nationalist strengthens their body through healthy living, sharpens and hones their mind through the pursuit of knowledge, and fortifies their spirit with steadfast determination in order to become the personification and vehicle of White Nationalism and victory.

8.A White Nationalist lies not to their comrades and people; for they are our family and honesty is our virtue.

9. A White Nationalist adds special significance to the concept of honor and will not accept any transgression against their cause, people, or their person.

10. A White Nationalist never surrenders, never retreats, and would rather die than accept any defeat.

I especially like their forum about day to day life, which is basically“This big black gorilla sat next to me and my children at the movie theater and I know he was just thinking about raping my aryan princess. I hate black people. Expletives.”

Yup. My two white friends are/were waiters.

They try to not consider me Black. They say I’m white. I do not like it one bit and usually throw one of‘em.(On a couch or something). But I ask them why and they say: you’re smart; you aren’t stingy with your money; you don’t get mad at silly stuff; you aren’t like other Black guys. Well, I should hope those things are true for somebody sincerely trying to be a good person.(What does that even mean?)

In a more benevolent way, my friends echo the sentiments of the comments from those blogs. Pure sadness.

Those words upset me. Not in a visceral way but more of a“I pity your ever breathing life”kind of way.

For some reason, Blacks are held accountable for each other as if we are all of one family; perhaps it is us calling each other brotha&amp;sista; daddy&amp;mahmah. Cousin. To a mind that is fed information outside of the loop, these concepts can be hard to digest. BUT no excuses.
IDK Champ. He could wake up tomorrow and any random person that has lived in the same neighborhood and not talked to him has a better chance explaining him. Why? Because of humanity. I don’t need to say this stuff. You all know…you Black too.

We are human first. What we see everyday is the result of what happened yesteryear. That is why we still talk all this slavery stuff and everything that came after it including James Raven(read: Jim Crow). And we ain’t‘sposed to be bitter that at one point in time we were treated worse than pets? That’s like being mad at women for wanting to claim her independence.

Personally, in truth, I’m proud of any person that finds a way to get over the past set by ignorance. In my heart of hearts, that is what I call evolution. One step higher at a time, during a life time.

Love is where hate comes from. Frustration and ignorance are brothers. Let’s clean that family picture up. Hold yourself to a standard&amp;respect it. Love

See, now dat’s why you my e-boo again. 

Content of character.

Unfortunately, a lot of races do this to each other. Blacks are whatever. Mexicans are lazy. Arabs are terrorists. Asians are whatever they are supposed to be. In reality, grouping races and blaming bad behavior of individuals on an entire group of people is just plain dumb.

Myself, I cringe when whites make blanket ignorant statements. It’s like, really? Did you really just say that? Can’t tell you how many whites I’ve insulted because homie don’t play dat. I call‘em out. Yes, I do. They don’t like it? Tough. Ain’t my problem. Take that BS somewhere else.

Nillalatte,

I don’t think I’m all that different from anybody else. I may be crazy for that. But I see every other Black guy do the same things I do and more. My biggest issues is in the“more”that they do. That more is typically nothing good.

But this topic is actually inspiring me to be not as happy as I was…I’m going to the gym. Y’all have a good night.

@ Sagey Bear: when your friends say“you’re smart”when explaining why you’re not like other Black people; how many of their teeth did you knock out of their mouth?

The“you’re not like them/the others”is one of the most condescending wannabe compliments closet racists say and believe.
And when you point out the error of that comment you get this from the
:“Oh you people are so sensitive!”
It’s so maddening you must laugh so you don’t get charged with manslaughter!

I don’t knock out a single tooth.

I’ll tell you why.

I bring other Blacks around them who aren’t ignorant. I widen that gap and watch what happens. I realize that you cannot force a mind to change how it“sees”. I can be mad about it and embarrass them but honestly, I just want to understand them and why they feel that way. If you met these guys, you wouldn’t have a single moment of anger. They are some of the greatest men I’ve met.

But I cannot defend the Blacks I’ve seen a lot in public. From shooting guns in restaurants to screaming, starting fights in grocery stores and being all around ignorant, I get embarrassed and diminished just being around them. Guilty like I did something wrong. I feel like an emissary to prevent n.iggas from being the scourge of humanity. I should be fired from that job.

In closing. I understand your disgust for my friends freedom of expression. I would rather not have them afraid of me because they are expressing their curiosity. The more I let them tell me, the more I can hear. These are my friends and I do want to know the truest intent of their characters. Sorry if I don’t live up to your standards of knocking the living sh.hit out of my“friends”. But if I go through perdition, you nor any other Black person I know has my back like they do. So no…no teeth.

I would rather have those said friends, so I know what is also runing through the minds of people who don’t look and act like me. This is one of the many issues I have with people who don’t belong to multinational cities or countries. You grow up in a diverse place, you understand real quick how people will judge you, and loop you with others, due to your race/faith/height and waistline for no apprenant reason, but because they can.

Moving to a segregated town, outside of London, as I’ve pointed out in other posts, is bloody hard work. All those years worrying about how other races view me is nothing, compared to how Black people sterotype other Black people. I mean I have an overstanding of the view points of why Asians,and Pacific people view me differently, but 5th generation Jamacian wants to get in my face for not speaking patios in a meeting, are you kidding me!!! Plus it will always be hard when you don’t fit the sterotype or current standard of Black person.

Keep hanging with your friends who are of another race/faith/class and social standard, it will only educate you and them, further.

I feel you on this. White friends can reveal a lot of stuff to you.

I remember watching the 2008 election in college, and when Obama won, of course all the black people I was watching with were elated. Most of the students on my campus were, but there were some white buddies of ours who were visibly upset. As the black people in the house celebrated, they dejectedly filed out, saying“congratulations”(very sadly lol) on their way out the door. Later, I talked to a very close white friend of mine and described how happy we all were and how we partied that night because of Obama’s win, and he tone turned very bothered as he proceeded to tell me that us partying was the dumbest thing he had ever heard of. Taken aback, I asked why. And he said something I will never, ever forget:“What is it, you all really think a half-black President is going to change anything?”

I responded very calmly and explained why we were so excited, and in retrospect, I’m surprised at and proud of myself for that. Because later, as I thought about it, I got pissed as hell and realized that I had every right to go off that dude. I would have said something like: Funny, now he’s only half-black? If you saw him walking down the street, especially if he was with his wife and daughters, he would be just another black man to you. In fact, before tonight, you referred to him as black. But now, in my moment of celebration, you feel the need to point out that he’s half-black…why? To suggest that he’s only half on my side or something? Secondly, you all lose your F-ing minds and get completely wasted just because your Division 3 hockey team won a game, but it’s stupid for us to celebrate the FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE FREAKIN UNITED STATES???!! Wow. You all continue to make it clear how threatened by us you feel. Our happiness in this moment must scare you to death for you to say that to me, after all we’ve been through. You basically just admitted to me that YOU DON’T WANT THINGS TO CHANGE for me and my people, and the fact that we have the audacity to hope that it will is a problem for you. You’re comfortable with your privilege, and you can’t stand to see us feeling united and empowered because that threatens the status quo. I don’t think anyone has ever said anything more racist to me than what you just said. Go fcuk yourself, and don’t ever call me again.

Glad I didn’t say that to him, but it felt good to type just now lol. I do wish I had called him out more on that bullsh!t though. I never looked at him the same after that.

I am convinced that for many white people, more than the hoodlums and thugs and triflin black folks, educated and successful black folks are their worst nightmare. And my white friends are the ones who convinced me.

I think what your friend were saying was based in fear. I think a lot of White people think that a Black guy isn’t going to care about them and their problems. Also, I think a decent chunk (though not all) of the Tea Party movement is built around the fear of Whites who are legitimately struggling thinking that a Black president will do a LOT more for Black people before checking for their issues. I’m not saying that justified calling the president the N-word. What I do think, though, is that we have to realize that it’s not all gravy for White people, and we ALL want someone to care for us. The second we as people realize that we aren’t the only ones with fears, life will be much easier.

I’ve had the experience that a lot of you have had, probably. I went to an all white college with rose colored sunglasses thinking we had overcome. Made a lot of liberal white friends. Then saw what they think when they feel threatened. They will go Jeckyll Hyde on you.

What cemented my distrust was when I passed certain benchmarks in my education and career and began to lose those white friends. Got into law school, pissed some of them off, passed the bar, my boss fired me. She was sure I wouldnt. When I bought my first condo, I will never forget this middle aged white rich man who would always invite the ladies to lunch at work gave me this ugly look I’ve never seen. Quit inviting me. I’ve seen that ugly look when judges and opposing counsel who were formally so nice discover that I’m not stupid.

All that to say, I discovered that their identity is founded on the false belief that they are superior. To a certain extent, they know its false, because they would not feel threatened if they truly believed it. But they have to have us under them to be able to balance themselves. It’s a relative identity dependent on us staying down.

Then I realized how weak they are, mentally. Allowing fragile lies to form their identity. It’s a form of insanity, really. I quit caring what they though. They need to believe the lies so desperately, I’d be wasting my time trying to change their minds. And they are not worth my time.

I agree with you somewhat WC on the White liberal college thing. Once I had to start dealing with them, especially when I blew up on my college’s newspaper scene, the ugliness underneath it all was astounding.

The thing is that throughout my existence, I’ve dealt with White people on all sorts of levels and have gotten all sorts of treatment. There are some rednecks who are just ignorant. There are some right-wing types and Jersey Shore wannabes who legitimately get along with Black people (then again, I just described half the White people I went to high school with LOL.) I’ve dealt with people who you’d think would be racist until they beam about their Black son-in-law in a very genuine way. I’ve dealt with so-called educated people who are so ridiculously ignorant about Black people that it would blow your mind.

I say all of this to say that people are people…with all of their various issues. The one thing I do notice is how scared so many people are. I think if we looked at racism as a form of fear first and foremost, it would be a lot easier to deal with their issues. In addition, I don’t think this is something that can be dealt with on a macro level, but on a person-by-person level, since fears are heavily individualized. If I can be of service to their issues, great. If not, that’s fine too. The key is to live your life. After all, you can’t control them, and they can’t control you.

I too went to a predominantly white university, and the one major incident of racism that I experienced was at the hands of my black“friends.”Go figure.

I think part of it was the fact that I was in Asian studies. So even if the students were predominantly white, we were ALL“minorities.”The racism I experienced living in Asia was less because I was“black”and more because I was“not Asian.”This has really effed up my perceptions of what it really means to be prejudiced against, because I gotta admit, in my personal experience very little of the holding back I got was tied specifically to my blackness.

Or maybe I’m just naive…#shrug

@Leonie UK- You’re absolutely right. Sometimes I feel the need to hang with em and educate them while they educate me but at other times it’s so deeply ingrained in them that it’s not worth the anger, the headache, and the depression. I’d rather just be comfortable. When I found out how so many black people who’s roots weren’t in this country really felt about us it hurt a lot more, because of all people I would’ve expected empathy and unity from them. Turns out my ass was just naive and idealistic (shrugs). Such is life. I just seek out cool, intelligent, and like-minded individuals these days, regardless of race, ethnicity, or nationality. Great points though.

@ Sagey Bear: I don’t doubt they have your back. Not at all. It’s the“you’re not like them”statement. I’ve had friends say“you’re not like them”and are genuinely thinking it’s a compliment. When I explained to a friend how would she feel if I looked down on Italian people as having big hair and excessively tight clothes (this was back in the day SageyBear and I’m cleaning up my language) but said to her“but you’re not like them”she understood.
I had to like her because she was a friend and not my Italian friend, just the same way she liked me because I’m her Black friend.

I do want to apologize for lumping your friends in the“racist category”because I don’t personally know them. I should’ve clarified much better in the original response that“you’re not like them”is something I’ve heard directed towards myself and other friends who have voiced the same

You’re right about seeing Blacks in public that fulfill the stereotypes (and then some). You cannot defend them; I can’t defend them because it’s not OUR RESPONSIBILITY to defend them. Just like how White people don’t try to explain rednecks; Arabs don’t try to defend the Taliban etcetera. Your responsibility is to be Sagey Bear&amp;mine is supposed to be Cris Until I Find a Clever Name, not stop what we’re doing and tell somebody we don’t know to stop _______________ (fill in the blank) because we both have Black skin.
I’m sure your friends (nor mine) expect us to do that at all. The only thing we can do is to ignore them and pray they don’t recognize us from High School.

We also have to remember that when people talk crazy to us and try to front like we are“not like the other blacks,”that we must politely put them in their places. I talk about race and racism for a living, so it is easy for me to tell someone that their racism is showing and that they might want to tuck it back in. However, we as VSPs need to all become more well versed in calling people out on their racist bull$hit. Calling a 2520 a racist is almost as bad as calling a black person a ni**er in their eyes, but they need to understand that the racist behaviors they display and the racist attitudes they perpetuate by handing out these kinds of sideways“compliments”are unacceptable. It has been my experience that most 2520s don’t understand racism as systemic and institutional. They typically only see racism as individual acts of malice and hatred based on race. It is our duty to educate the ones we care about and help them to see the bigger picture. In my work, I teach school and school system leaders all about race, and racism so that they can identify how racism is a work in our schools and in our school district. We get into examining personal beliefs, where those beliefs come from, and how these beliefs imapact kids of color in classrooms. Hell I even tell them about how they impact white children by perpetuating a viscious cycle of stereotyping. Bottom line, having conversations about racism as systemic as opposed to racism as a personal indictment goes a loooooooong way with 2520s and many of them start to see things in a whole new light. When people know better they do better. When they choose not to do better, they’ve shown you their true selves.

When you say calling them out, you mean (in as simple a phrasing as I can compose) informing them of the negligence of their views, the oversights and inaccuracies?

As it stands, these friends of mine think I’m more racist than they are. Because I recognize racism. I tell them“just because you don’t taste cinnamon in the bread doesn’t mean that there is no cinnamon in the bread.”A spin on the“absence of evidence…”phrase. Usually, they just admit to being afraid of Black men, intimidated by Black women and afraid to go out at night when they can’t see the darker among us.

That is exactly what I mean Sagey. The people you care about have to know that this is not correct, nor is it acceptable. When I call people out on racism, it is never in a confrontational way, albeit direct and honest. Straight talk, no chaser, yet respectful and heartfelt.

@Sagey Bear What you say is so true! I grew up in the suburbs in Ky and all my life I was called a“white girl”because I spoke proper, dressed different, and because I enjoyed things that were considered to be things that White people liked and that used to infuriate me. Funny thing I still hear that some of my non black friends living in Los Angeles. I hear it from blacks and whites but I learned that being defensive and angry only shuns the person away and adds to the idea they already had in their minds. Instead of responding with anger ask them why they feel that way and show them that they’re wrong like you said instead of telling them they’re wrong. Ignorance is a hard cycle to break, I know b/c I used to be ignorant about a lot of things. It’s up to the individual to being open to learning new things and exchanging ideas and thoughts like and adult instead of going back and forth with insults like children

Champ you just described my father. He doesn’t trust waiters at all, especially White waiters. He may still be angry about the Woolworth’s counters my mother protested with sit-ins back in the day.

Having said that, I am an excellent tipper when I get excellent service. I used to be a regular at my favorite breakfast spot, and the waiters knew me by name. Not only that, I made sure my child knew how to act right in restaurants. And he got to eat his favorite bacon and waffles. Win-win-win for all of us.

But even then, nothing burns me up as a waiter with an attitude, who feels they are entitled to a tip but do not feel entitled to provide excellent customer service.

The comments section did not phase me either. It’s the most vocal of racism that uses the internet as their bullhorn. That is all.

I went on a date Sunday evening and my date found hair in his broccoli casserole. He didnt ask for the meal to be free, just for it to be replaced. When the waiter came back with the bill he informed him that the meal was free-something we both weren’t expecting.

And because of stereotypes like those above, I am afraid of asking waiters to take my meal back when I don’t like it.

also, the tip should be considered something comes with the food. the food is paired with service. so if you want to tip less then order less expensive food or go to a different restaurant.

No, 20% is the norm because of inflation. (Every blog seems to have been covering tipping, so this is the consensus I have seen).

I just don’t think its fair for people like me to judge others if they aren’t capable of paying the same amount of tip that I can. Also, in America since tip isn’t part of the cost of the food at most places it is left up to the person paying for the food to judge.

I don’t think people should be vilified because of the way they tip. I feel like this is wholly trivial. Maybe there is something wrong with our culture that wait staff aren’t paid enough that they have to live off tips. In Europe most tip is added to the bill and in some fine dining establishments they do the same.

Inflation is to account for the amount the servers are paid. Inflation increases by about 3% each year. Servers still get paid very low despite their salary not being worth much.

I think its unfair to group“blacks”into one group. I think this situation is more a class issue and not about race. In America I’ve notice that often people lump class and race issue together, which becomes confusing because people don’t know whether an issue relates to class or race. I don’t think everything is about race. I think we make things about race.

This is one point that I have to agree with Mr. Piggy on. 20% tips are reserved for the most outstanding service from the most pleasant waiter/waitress who I was pleasantly surprised by and had a good conversation with and found that we have quite a few things in common. He or she had to have really opened my eyes to something concerning something vital or something I was interested in. Otherwise the standard is DEFINITELY 15%. Someone was running game on you sweetheart

In my experience, the norm in the Mid west, Seattle and the East Coast (all places in which I have lived and waited tables) has been 20% for good service for years now. I’ve waited tables for years in between college and grad school and even for a spate about two years ago, when I left my last high pressure, high travel post and was unsure of what I wanted to do next. I actually think uncertainty and resistence to tipping among some blacks really falls along class and exposure lines. If you go out to non chain restaurants and or travel much on business accounts or for pleasure, look around and notice what other people are doing. In my experience as a server and as a patron, the overwhelming majority of people who are educated and have professional jobs are tipping between 15 to 20 percent with 15 being the floor for adequate service.

The norm may vary depending on where you live. And the type of restaurant you go to. In Berkeley, Chez Panisse, where dinner is at least $60-$80 per person, adds 17% to all bills regardless of the size of the party. Other restaurants that I’ve been to, that are less expensive, add an 18% gratuity for larger groups. Still other restaurants include information about how much to tip if you want to tip 15,17, 18, or 20%.

but its not something that comes with the food. the food has its own price. or else on the menu it would list“price with tip”.

you’re arent entitled to a tip. the restaurant hired you to take people’s orders and bring them what they requested. and thats what you do/ did, i assume. Should we pay you extra for doing what you were hired to do, except you did it with a big ol smile and a friendly tone? Sh*t if that’s the case, people who work at fast food places and retail stores should get a tip too. An INDIVIDUAL tip, not the collective jar. You know what, lets make it anyone with a job. Cuz ideally, you’re supposed to be nice and friendly with all customers/clients when you provide a service. My point is, a good tip (or a tip at all) isn’t something that should be expected IMO

i’m willing to listen to an argument about how the tipping system operates in this country. but don’t act like the reason that blacks tip poorly is because they’ve discovered this flaw in the system and think it is unfair. they tip poorly for other reasons. please be honest about this.

the point is that there is an unwritten social rule that patrons tip a certain amount for *good* service. but black people don’t abide by that unwritten rule and then complain if they actually get worse service. the problem is that everyone else is more likely to abide by this system, therefore that would explain why they get better service.

So what you seem to be saying is that you don’t treat customers as individuals. Are you implying that if a few black people don’t tip you that represents us all and we all in general deserve to be treated poorly? I always tip very well but according to your comments I will have a waiter who expects me not to tip based on the color of my skin and should be treated poorly and judged because the previous black person didn’t tip?

Something you don’t seem to understand is that any customer who receives bad service SHOULD complain, and it doesn’t matter whether they are tipping or not…..every customer always deserves to have a good experience.

What percentage of black people need to tip well in order for me to not be looked at as a stingy black customer when I walk into your restaurant?

There is a lot of diversity in the group“black people.”Even if“black people”in general are bad tippers, are there other characteristics that make this more or less so? Age? # in the group? People on dates? People in suits? People at lunch with clients? People getting drinks after work? People coming in after church? Black people out with their white friends, co-workers, dates?

In my family, my sister is a terrible tipper who says she can’t afford to tip because she and her husband are often underemployed or unemployed. My father overtips because he believes in some sort of financial karma where he needs to share his money with others if he wants to continue to do well financially.

EXACTLY. The fact that this is even allowed is the real problem. Especially since tips aren’t guaranteed. They are based on performance. And should be. This country should not be able to get away with paying folks under min. wage just because they MAY get something extra on the side. GTFOH.

WTF! That doesn’t make a lick of sense! People are presenting clear arguments and showing you where they stand, but all you’re doing is hinting at some sort of inferiority or something (and not acknowledging the validity of what they’re saying). You won’t even actually come out and say it either. What other reasons? People are telling you that no other minimum wage job expects a tip so why should servers (I disagree now that I know better, because as i said $2.35 is NOT minimum wage, especially given how hard servers work in comparison to retail workers), but you’re about to lose me and I’m actually arguing in your favor to a large extent. Chill with the prejudice bullsh*t man, you’re burning bridges unnecessarily. And to argue that servers have a right to discriminate against all black because of some trend they noticed and based on what they hear from other servers is a bullsh*t excuse to be racist to someone before they even have a chance to prove that the stereotype doesn’t apply to them. You’re not entitled to a tip, just as you’ve proved that blacks are not entitled to empathy or respect from other races. Get over yourself and your profession. Make an actual case that doesn’t involve entitlement. It’s getting harder and harder to defend you smdh

But how do you as a server know that I as a specific black patron do not comply with the unwritten, uncodified, not really a law,“rules”regarding tipping?

I understand the concept of bad service being punishment for bad tipping. But service comes before a tip is rendered. So unless the server has history with a specific black patron, how do they know who are the bad tippers. Is there some sorta secret siren that goes off in the kitchen when black bad tippers arrive. It sounds like servers are doling out punishment before the crime of bad tipping is committed; which rightfully leads to bad tipping. And the vicious cycle of black on server crime (or is it server on black crime) is continued.

Someone wisely asked, what percentage of Blacks need to start tipping at 20 plus % for all blacks to receive good service at your restaurant? I’d ask, what percentage of blacks actually tip below 15% at your restaurant–70%, 50%, 20%? I suspect its probably a lot lower than what its made out to be. But if one out of ten black patrons tip bad, then in some folks mind, all blacks tip bad regardless what the other 90% do.

And I also find the concept of servers believing they are being“run”by blacks interesting. In my profession, I have had secretaries that were older and less melanin enhanced as I. For a small number of these folks, working for someone young, gifted and black was a bitter pill to swallow. The smallest request, like“hey can you make a copy of x for me please”was treated as if I asked them to walk to Brooklyn for some cheesecake. I think some waiters may have similar attitudes towards having to serve black patrons.

No it shouldn’t. If the food was great and the service sucked, how are you still entitled to a 15% tip? If you didn’t add anything to the dining experience or took away from it, how is it I still owe you extra on top of paying for the food? Simply because you got it to the table and it was consumed?

If that’s how you feel, you should only work in restaurants that include the tip in every bill regardless of service.

I’m not supporting Mr. Piggy by any means but I will say as an African American that is a server going to a restaurant and being served is a privilege. There are many other options for dining. For instance when I’m low on finances I don’t go out to eat @ a sit down restaurant (unless it’s happy hour) I go to Subway or I go to the grocery store and buy something from the deli if I don’t feel like cooking myself. When I have money I go out to eat and I tip b/c being a server is not easy. There is a lot that goes with that job and regardless of what anyone says we have to cover the taxes on the tips that Uncle Sam is guessing we make b/c it’s assumed we’re making at least %15. I hear people say“you don’t tip workers at McDonalds why should I tip a server?”I’ve worked at a fast food restaurant and the type of work cannot be compared to being a server or bartender. I’m serving your food and drinks to your liking. I’m cleaning your table and your spills and your children’s mess. I’m dealing with picky and meticulous guests(not just black) that want a cocktail with exactly two cubes of ice not more not less(yes I actually had a guest request that!) and for that I feel I deserve to be compensated for that. Just like we have a choice in what jobs we choose to have you have a choice in dining options.

I also have the choice to tip or not to tip.

I’m trying to be empathetic here, but it seems like the onus is being put on the customer. That I should tip because they’re going to be taxed on it…or that if I’m low on funds, that perhaps I shouldn’t go out.

Should I also not order a pizza? The delivery man expects a tip now too. Should I not order drinks at the bar? The bartender expects tips too. How long should I remain captive to the particulars of someone else’s employment, finance, and/or tax situation? If I can’t tip the barber should I also not get a haircut? If i can’t tip the cab should I not ride? The whole premise is faulty. It is not my job to supplement someone else’s wage (yes…even in states where they are allowed to pay less than minimum wage based on future projected tips). That is a formula used by the employers…not an obligation to the customers.

And given how much under reporting takes place anyway (especially on cash tips) forgive me if I don’t join the chorus line on this one.

In closing…

It depends…are you eating at Red Lobster or Nicks Fishmarket.

Are you eating a burger at Steak n Shake or DMK Burger Bar.

In other words what is your service time…because as the price point goes up the service level goes up as well.

Running a burger from the kitchen to your table and giving you a soda is one thing at S n S where you order and seat yourself

When you order lobster from RL you are getting the refills on drinks, biscuits, your starter salad, maybe an appetizer or dessert…thats a lot more work time and attention.

If you are at DMK or NF the service level, or the number of steps need to not just bring you your order but add to your dining experience arent even in the same stratosphere when compared with those other two places.

So part of your treat is where ever you decide to go is to acknowledge the upgrade in service vs what would be considered the ordinary experience.

And your server is responsible for that…and so they have earned a tip that is reflected in the bill increase…think of it this way for every request you are increasing your price point as well as your service level.

So a burger and a soda may only be worth a dollar or two in service.

But even at RL if your bill is 30 or 40 bucks, you have used a minimum of 5 or 6 dollars worth of service and should tip accordingly…so it is a good idea to add this to your birthday treat budget.

Because your server is doing a heck of a lot more than just bringing you a burger ~JS

I tip, and usually well. My service has to be absolutely HORRIBLE for me to undertip. Also, my granny was a server for years when she first moved to Kansas City, so I grew up hearing stories, and I recognize the struggle.

That being said, filling drinks, getting different courses of a meal, etc etc is YOUR JOB. That is not anything super special. Tips come from going above and beyond, not doing what you’re paid to do in the first place. It’s all about customer service, which is something that many people in the service industry don’t understand. (Another lesson from granny, and another reason why she was the“house favorite”at that restaurant, and people tipped her well. Well enough to be able to raise her 6 children comfortably and put them through college)

I worked retail from the ages of 16-22, and gave amazing customer service. I didn’t just say hello to the customer, I actually helped them, answered all questions and went to the limits to solve problems. I figured, no matter the color, that I would treat these patrons the way I want to be treated when I visit stores or restaurants. Do I understand that sometimes you’re just having a bad day? Yes, which is why I don’t jump to taking it personal when someone doesn’t give me good service. HOWEVER, in every long, dry, boring training I’ve sat through, they make a point of saying that all workers should leave their personal business at home, and not bring it with them to work. You are in the service industry, your job is to SERVE. You get paid to be cordial and accommodating while assisting your client with their needs. So don’t think that you deserve extra when you’re doing the bare minimum, and that’s what a tip is. A reward for going above and beyond…for doing extra.

Even strippers get tipped based on their performance.

That whole post was great Amazonian Midget, but this quote caught my attention because of my experience the night before last lol

”Even strippers get tipped based on their performance.”

AMEN! And looks (as opposed to just performance) too unfortunately for some. This one stripper tried to get buck on me because I ain’t want her funky lap dance. I don’t know why she kept singling me out in a party of 5 (not to mention a club FULL of patrons). I was on a budget and she was NOT worth my time. It’s not like I asked her to dance then didnt tip and it’s not like I let her dance on me first then refused to tip. As soon as she forced herself on me (all three times) I said“No thank you, I’m good”. She kept coming back, then instead of leaving and finding someone to tip her, she starts loudly proclaiming how“If you ain’t got no money don’t come to a strip club”. I was too busy admiring another act on stage to hear her, but if I did, I would’ve said.“If you ain’t got no *ss (or tits) don’t work at a strip club”lol, but seriously though I had money, just not for her. Don’t get in your feelings when you work as a stripper. Like men in the dating world, you need to have thick skin (no pun intended lol) if you make the choice to work in a superficial business such as a strip club. Champ I think we finally have a parallel for women to understand what rejection is like. And I was nice with the way I rejected her too lol

No figures to speak of, some looked dirty, hair was a mess…and the list went on and on and on.

I suppose there are higher end strip clubs?

@fivegirl The difference is is that we are taxed on the amount of the check and we have to tip out a percentage of the total of your check to bussers, bartenders, expo, etc. The fact of the matter is I can’t help what my employer decides to pay me and for those who say“you know what you were getting into when you got the job”you tell me where I can get a better job so easily now a days with the economy. I work with people that have their masters and got laid off from there jobs or can’t find a job in their field and had to work as a server to pay their bills. Believe me I don’t enjoy waiting table matter of fact I HATE being a server but my bills aren’t going to pay themselves while I try to build my business. What happened to people wanting to be kind to others? If a server does a good job or better why not hook them up? It’s called karma people!! What did I ever do to you expect try to do my job at the best of my ability and provide you with great service. What about the good servers that look beyond the stereotypes??

I eat out twice a day. When I sit at the table, the server automatically starts with a 15% tip from me. That will go up or down depending on the quality of service I receive. I calculate that in my head on the after-tax amount. Some people I know simply double the 8.25% tax; I take 10%, then take half of that and add it to the 10% in the interest of keeping my mind sharp…yes, I’m nerdy, but I’ve digressed. I’ve had situations where I tipped only enough to show that I am a tipper when I received craptastic service, and I have had situations where my tip was more than the amount of the check due to outstanding service, but how I tip depends entirely on the quality of service received. If I get poor service because of a stereotype, then the waiter will be rewarded accordingly. If the waiter gambles that I tip poorly, he reaps the consequences of that gamble so he should choose wisely.

I stated”In the same way minorities cannot just look at ur ancestors and say they were all evil and that’s why they“won”you cannot look at your ancestors and assume you were smarter (or manifest destiny or whatever) and think that’s why you won”History is made by winners, meaning what goes in the history books is the account of whoever was lucky enough to come out the victor. This white person had honestly never heard it put that way. If we had not had that conversation…..? Not saying they are Team Yes We Can today but sometimes you can’t assume somebody is actively being racist. Sometimes (often) it is ignorance and an unwillingness to see things from all POV’s. And blacks can be guilty of this as well. I just feel you could be doing yourself a disservice. Just my humble opinion.

Actually I’ve gotten into a few verbal scraps with other“friends of friends”because they say some BEYOND SLICK things about Black people are they are shocked when the see a comment directed to them with a Black woman’s face as the Profile Picture.

It is difficult to shake the feeling that the comments expressed in anonymity don’t represent closely held and intimate beliefs of people we would otherwise consider“good folks”.

LOL, it took you long enough. 

I think many black people have had that one shared experience of seeing someone you considered a“friend”show their a$$ one good time (or two). That friend or group of friends that made you want to believe that things WERE different, and that THEY were different…

…only to have them say or do something to show you,“the water might not be cloudy but it’s still poisonous”. And y’all wonder why I get all Hulk Smashy about sharing our life and our culture with those who are not a part of it…things like this reinforce the meme that we can only truly rely on and/or trust ourselves (generalization albeit).

Does that mean we are above reproach or criticism? Obviously not. If anything this site demonstrates that we are critical of each other on a daily basis–but at the foundation of that criticism is a love and appreciation and a desire to see us become better. And I think that matters.

That was hard to read but I am glad I did. I’ve been in a relationship with a white man before and I have had long time white friends…those comfy around black people and those who did not grow up around us. I try and keep it 100 with them all the same because if we don’t move out of that comfort zone where everybody is playing first date nice with each other how will we ever move beyond what’s really under the surface and really get to a place where we can claim post-racial gobady-gook, yada yada yada? I tell white people (and I mean this 100%) that for me and for black people that I am close with, we assume from the gate that a white person is racist and then allow them to either prove otherwise or to confirm that. No it doesn’t mean I won’t treat you with mutual respect, empathy or that I won’t treat you kind but until I get to know you and your heart/intentions…I assume you think the worst of me. I have worked as a waitress before in HS and in my experience a certain type of black folks (ya’ll know) would expect the world and made it extra hard on me. Of course, not ALL blacks are like this and of course I had tables of extra iggy white folks too (not all, of course). The diff (and this is what I don’t think most white people get/care to understand) is that a white person can be a gem, a beyotch, be in a bad mood, a good mood, be cheap, be generous, be having a bad day…. whatever…they are allowed to represent themselves to the masses. We are burdened with having our individual actions (in individualized moments in time) be scrutinized as the normal behavior of all of our people. I hate to read things like Piggy’s comment but at the time I want to hear it because I want all this koombaya BS out so we can chop it up and move past it.

Any who, I read the article and enjoyed it and love to see the way the VSB’s are branding themselves.

Exactly. And I co-sign the guilty till proven innocent mentality with them. It’s not that I think they think the“worst of me”. I just assume that they don’t expect much intellectually from me and that they feel superior to me even if on a sub-conscious level. (everything about American culture suggests this to them and to us. they can’t help it unless they make a strong and constant effort not to believe this) It’s one of the many reasons I’d never marry a white chick. Relationships have enough drama, stress, ego, and power struggles involved as it is. I’d be ready to strangle someone if I had to deal with a racial element on top of all that (maybe if she was Latin or something like that, but even then it would be tough). I just can’t do it.
To anyone who is seeking an interracial relationship, more power to you. I don’t look down on you for this, but it sure as hell couldn’t be me…

I use the tip calculator app. EASY!

this“problem”might be because we as black people have had to work twice as hard to make it in this world. So if we don’t feel like giving you EXTRA of our hard-earned money for doing what you were hired to do in the first place, forgive us.

and I agree with theeclectic.. a tip is something that customers give the waiter for their service out of the KINDNESS OF THEIR HEART. If a someone feels you deserve $2, that’s their prerogative (sp? my Mac changed it from perogative). Its a perk, like how camp counselors get a lil money from parents at the end of the summer. Don’t expect it, and be grateful when you get it.

@CaribbeanQueen Us working hard as black people have nothing to do with it. When you pay for the bill you’re paying for the food the service is something completely separate. I work my a** off insuring people have a great experience when sitting in my section. It’s not only about the food and the drinks but it’s also about the SERVICE! That’s why you went to a restaurant to eat in the first place b/c you didn’t feel like cooking and SERVING YOURSELF! Don’t act like there’s no other dining option but to go out to eat. Just like you said receiving a tip is a perk going out to dine and being served is a perk. If I don’t have much money I go to Subway and get something to eat if I don’t feel like cooking. I don’t waste a hardworking servers time and table to leave them with scraps. As it is people look down on us and treat us like gum on the bottom of their shoe but to leave a 5% tip after I provided excellent service is just a slap in the face. Why are people so angry about doing a nice gesture for someone who cleaned up your dirty plates and served your food and drinks to your liking? I get it if the server sucks but don’t punish the good ones like myself.

Why do you want to have a candid discussion with a white person who can’t even pour pee out of a boot with the instructions written on the bottom?

These people are not the people you need to have a conversation with. Hell, I couldn’t even have a conversation with them! (notice: I’m yt) Their mentality is seriously warped.

Ever heard of Pavlov’s dog? It’s all about conditioning. Just like the dog, people are conditioned by their environment and experiences. Only the more highly intellectual folks (and not all) recognize this conditioning. The funny part about conditioning is even though you may be able to remove some of the responses to stimuli and recondition your responses, it becomes so ingrained in your psyche that you still have little parts of that conditioning that like PTSD that may sneak up on you when you least expect it.

That racial neurosis is a mutha#^(%@. I play devil’s advocate all the time, benefit of the doubt you got it. I try to anyway.
Maybe he just sucks as a waiter, nobody told her not to reach across my plate to clear another one away, no one bothered to school him that fingers on the rim of my glass and no straw is not the business. Or it is super busy tonight, they didn’t forget to get me my refill, they just have to pick up the chic who called out last minute’s tables in addition to his own. I give all this a chance to be true before I go to angry-no-tip-for-you mode. But I will be d@mned if hair in my food gets a pass. Ever. (It has only happened to me once and I lost my appetite, no thank you I do not want anything else).
This is my long winded way of saying, I look for anything else to be the blame before I go to racism or racial discrimination. But sometimes it just has no other explanation.
Why can the middle age white guy read you the riot act for not getting him some A1 steak sauce but you treat none of the other middle age white dudes like that @.ss.ho!e? Why because she loud and black and wrong and too broke to tip does that mean you have to take that out on me? This is where the problem lies. there are ridiculous rude and uncouth white folks out there but that is never looked as the rule, more the exception. But ridiculous rude and uncouth black folks somehow is the rule and reflects on me?!? GTFOH

If you treat your customers the way you are portraying yourself on this board, I would say, No you don’t!

You have some serious issues. Some of the shit you are saying absolutely is not indicative of a tentative server. Back in the day, I was a restaurant manager in fast food and full service in predominately black communities. MOST of my customers were wonderful patrons. Cared for how their food was prepared and served with the utmost cleanliness and care.

Yes, there were some patrons that were less than stellar and my regular customers side eyed them all the time. We tolerated their behavior. It was deplorable.

Tips to servers were across the board and generally the average of 15-18%.

What? How and when did I make you think I walk in with a chip on my shoulder? I never get loud with a server. I give them the benefit of the doubt when the service is less than my liking and that is usually rare.
Maybe I was unclear, or you lack reading comprehension (IDK): my comment was about me considering all the other possibilities before assigning a racial slant to bad encounters that others may assign a racial undertone.
Many of my family have worked as servers, I skipped it because I don’t have the skill necessary to be good at it. I know it’s not easy.
All I am saying and have seen repeated by others is that for some reason it appears that Black people don’t get to just represent themselves, somehow one of us is no different than the next (resulting in over generalizations) and that simply isn’t true. Whereas one bad White patron, doesn’t spoil the bunch.
I appreciate good customer service, and can count on one hand the number of times I haven’t left a tip and I eat out just about every day. So with that said, it takes a whole lot of apathy towards the job and/or a general discourteous attitude for me to not leave an adequate or even generous tip.
But more to the point of the post (which I don’t really think was about Black people and their tipping habits) -
“a manifestation of this mindset is you wondering if all things that happen to you are somehow related to you being black”
- personally, race is not my go to reason for a bad encounter. I can see how in some situations though we may have to think a bit about it first though. But as for me I prefer not to let someone else’s bad mood or day become my bad mood or day, whether my race was a factor for them or not.

I used to be one of those people who would tip waiters/waitresses well, no matter what. even sh*tty service. not anymore. the one thing we really have a right to be picky about is what we eat, and that includes how it is served to us. I’m not saying that folks have a right to be rude, but you can definitely have it your way. and if you don’t get it your way, you are more than welcomed not to pay for crappy service. if that makes a race“intellectually inferior”then I’d like to know what is the definition of“intellectually superior.”

so G.L. Piggy, you damn right we walk in there with a chip on our shoulder. we are putting stuff into our bodies and we go out to eat to unwind. that’s not something you take lightly.

I happen to be black and I happen to be a VERY fair tipper. Even when service is quite subpar I leave at least 16-18 % just because I understand that people in these jobs really do need the tip and according to my dad I have“a bleeding heart”. I am not picky at all and have never sent anything back because I have a fear of waiters and any angry person dealing with my food (Food holds a sacred place in my heart!) It saddens me that if I were to walk into the restaurant where this guy works he would presume the worst about me because of the color of my skin and consciously or unconsciously give me low rate service. That’s the thing about being black, I do not feel like an individual human but like an idea…some ambassador for my race whether I want to be or not. In terms of schooling i have been going to predominantly white and asian schools from high school until the college I now attend. Some people of color have told me I am“white”or I sound so“white”and I do this or that“white”BUT in quite a few of my classes I have had white young men have unnecessarily assume that I was being agressive or confrontational when I am really not that girl. If we are discussing a topic and I happen to have a different opinion they make a“relax girl”gesture and I’m left confused. I actually had to ask a couple of my friends about it. Am I (quiet and shy) aggressive? They assured me I was not. Then we had a discussion about the“mad black woman”stereotype. See, these young men expect agressiveness from me and even if I’m shucking and jiving and smiling like a chesire cat they think I’ll break out with the neck roll and“who gone check me boo?”at any minute. :sigh:

I think the problem is that they see us as a collective and not a group of individuals. So if they run into Deshawn and Deshawn tips badly all coloreds tip badly.It’s not that Deshawn is cheap.

I can only speak for myself, but I think I am typical of most servers. I go in assuming that I’m going to get a bad tip from black patrons, but that’s just money. I’ll give them good, prompt service because it is worth it just to give patrons what they want. And that table is there, so why not make the most of it? If I’m getting $3 by default, there’s nothing else to do about that other than try to do something to increase that dollar amount.

So servers may have a general perception of black patrons, but I don’t think that filters into the service. And if a black person is at least friendly and not rude/demanding then it’s not really a big deal. It’s just money.

Sorry, I just refuse to believe that your preconceptions do not influence the service you give on any level. You may (or may not) provide“good, prompt service”but trust me people probably notice your unconscious behavior. Your pinched smile, rolling eyes or abrupt words. Something about a waiter with a bad attitude just buts a rotten taste in the mouth, while a friendly, genuine one may enhance the dining experience. Upthread you stated that you know(how do you know???!!!!) if you do not provide black patrons with the extra service they think they deserve they will get“real loud, real fast.”So, don’t you think your expectation of this tarnishes the service you give on some level?

Maybe it’s not that blacks are loud and needy. Maybe it’s latent prejudice. Maybe you think a black peson should know their place and if they expect something more that shoddy service they are getting out of line?

Maybe?

Yeah, well if you’re looking that hard for something to be wrong then you’ll find it regardless of your servers’inner thoughts.

So it’s very convenient (not to mention debilitating) to sit there and think that every little tic is an indication of the servers’racism. You can hold this opinion, but you should also give equal credence to the possibility that servers are merely reacting to patterns they’ve witnessed time and again. Take the observations of black people here who’ve waited tables. They also say that blacks are bad tippers and more of a pain to wait on. And the study I cited in my piece controls for the patrons’feeling about the service they received. Even then–when black patrons felt they received good service–they tipped worse.

So your responses have not proven anything. You’ve just tossed out a just-so explanation for why you think that you’re justified in having a chip on your shoulder.

Firstly,I never once mentioned racism. It is not a word I use very often because I think it is sometimes unfairly and overused. I said“prejudice.”There is a difference. Secondly I threw out an example, never once did I give an account of a personal experience. And read my first post, I do not have a chip on my shoulder and mostly have had good experiences with waiters and go in with a very open mind always. But of course because I am a black woman you presume I have this chip.

Your prejuduce is quite overt and I do not know if it is because you have the bravado that comes with internet anonymity but if you feel this way in your heart I strongly believe it may influence your service.

My explanation was not so so. I am pointing out a fact. Unless you are quite the actor people often see through the facade of pleasantness to true feelings an intent. Is this untrue ?Also, I never spoke about“tics”being evidence of racism. I spoke of pinched smiles,rolled eyes and abrupt language as evidence of a terrible attitude. Don’t you agree that that is what such actions usually signify?

I get the feeling I am not dealing with an intellectual equal.

Interesting statement coming from someone who explicitly said that typical waiters see a Black table and automatically brace themselves for bad service.

Your wrong . We know many of you think like this bud. We smell it on you like a stench of bile soaked trousers. Your body language,demeanor,fake hospitality. Lack of genuine human care makes me detach your humanity as well. Same way you have views about me I automatically think your a lazy white person who didn’t go to school and are a server for over half a decade at some second tier Italian resturant. Why give lazy people extra money? You could have a better job, you choose to be a server. If I had 20 dollars to tip you I probably would if you asked about my day talked with me as a.person and really tried to connect on a human level instead of another colored patron. But o well noe I will feel even less bad when I drop the 5 dollar tip .

Using your logic, Black people can expect that their waiter doesn’t really expect much from them and translates that into, this waiter isn’t even trying.

You may think that your thoughts are hidden but based on your response to my other comment, you don’t know what good service is anyway, so maybe you just sucked and that was the reason for your experience.

“I go in assuming that Im going to get a bad tip from black patrons”

You are contributing to your receiving a bad tip from black patrons whether you realize it or not. There was a study similar to this done on students in elementary schools. If the teacher expected certain students to do well, they did well in their subjects. If the teacher expected certain students to do poorly, they did. There is a level of expectation that is uniquely delivered through your actions, tone of voice, posture, etc., that says you expect a certain type of behavior. Guess what…that’s what you get in return.

As an experiment, change your behavior and your expectations just for the hell of it and see what happens. What do you have to lose?

If that need were there, he would ironically have the control over you. Don’t run that potential out of your realm of self.
He, nor any other person is simply going to change how they feel when it is based on experience and they believe in it. Truth is, a lot of Blacks don’t tip well. They may not know the etiquette, may not know the importance of it and they may not care. But everybody can’t tip while some can’t tip well.

My main effort is, how are we going to tell him that it is wrong for him to feel that way. You feel the way you do, don’t you? His sins, his soul. His dinner, his stomach, into his toilet. Being upset ain’t really going to change anything. Debt ceiling. Who ain’t mad about that? Didn’t change spit though did it?

Anyways, I’m droning from point to point hoping you hear me out…but really, the longer I make this, the less likely people are to read it. Ironic. Let‘em think Blacks are stup_d. Let em think what they want. The provisions are in place and we are putting more in place to further to impact that Blacks have on society. This evolution and physiological difference stuff is coming from unqualified opinions and that makes no sense at all. You are never going to hear me fussing at someone for investing improperly…I don’t know that life. I’m going to stick to what I’m good at, which happens to be conflict resolution and thinking. I’m going back to school. September. Worried but going.

TBH, I was fine reading this article. I’ve seen much more vitriolic racism in my short life. I do not acclimate to the misplaced rage. By my comprehension, fear is a normative behavior. With clandestine fear breeding another more misplaced clandestine fear, this cycle becomes poisonous, venomous&amp;violent. That is where I reach my limit for this topic.

There is far too much pain in this topic. I cannot even imagine the enormity of emotion that was plunged into the darkness of ignorance behind these fears and latent distrusts of each other.

At this point, I just want to dread my hair, tattoo Africa morphing into a lion on my chest with my favorite verse from the Bible&amp;Ko’ran on the opposite pectoral muscle. A Zulu mask on my arm and a gorilla on the other arm. Then just stop talking to all 2520′s and completely resegregate my life. I’m so ready to be done with racism, intolerance, bigotry&amp;ignorance.
And it’s not that I cannot handle it but that I do not desire to deal with such despicable souls any longer. Can we just be….over it?

I don’t have a fear of white folks making my food, being in the kitchen or any of that jazz. I do have a fear of pissing my server (regardless of race) off to the point where my food has“mysterious”biological items. If the service isn’t up to par before I made my order, then I’ll gladly walk out before it gets to the level where I don’t tip. That’s not always what I can do, but if that’s an option, then I’ll do it.

I notice that whatever one thinks, so it will be. If a white person comes into a dining situation, sees me and thinks“this black chick won’t tip,”then they may not put up their A-game service and thus, I’ll tip…but it will be less.

After reading this though, I swear I have to check myself so I don’t look at white folks a bit differently. Bottom line, white folks still have a long way to go in how they view black people.

AND…we have an even longer way to go in how we represent ourselves. What do I mean? For example:

I’m me. You don’t speak for me. What you do in your own life is your individual issue. The point is we want to be judged individually. We all SAY we want that, but think about how we react when something is said publicly about one of us. We band together. That’s not wrong and I’m not asserting that it shouldn’t be this way. But, the issue is we’re either together or separate. If we’re together, then we band together for EVERYTHING…not just some things. We help each other, stop criticizing each other, stand up for each other and begin to do tear the walls down that create friction or barriers among us.

If not, then defend your own behavior and don’t concern yourself with what someone says about another person who happens to look like you. I’m not saying which one I agree with more. I’m saying, it’s hard to see black people collectively take to task misconceptions other races have about us, when we won’t/don’t/can’t take the time to dissect and correct the misconceptions we have with our own and build from there.

I read Champ’s post on The Good Men Project and the comments that ensued; I also follow him on twitter where he posted a link to GL Piggy’s post. It’s always a little weird for me reading these racist comments because these are people who really believe this and turn into internet thugs because they’re relatively anonymous. However it just affirms what I believe about a lot of white people, especially so called liberals.

I went out to dinner tonight and my waitress was not friendly and she definitely seemed to be rushing us through our meal. I didn’t think it was because we’re black and thus she expected a crappy tip, so why bother to shuck and jive; but if I were the one paying I would have only given her 15%; and proved THEIR theory right. I normally tip 18% for good service and 20% for excellent.

Champ, as far as GL is concerned, looks like you ran into a straight up bigot. The Internets bring them out in droves, as i’m sure you know. And sense that was HIS blog, his followers are as socially and analytically incompetent as he is. Sux to be him.

Now, to the question of should we air official“Black People’s Business”(TM) in mixed company? Well, if the point is foster constructive dialogue with the other racial“Power Conferences”then my answer is yes. Just be aware that anything proposing to create a change“Positively”, attracts attention from those who are comfortable living“negatively”.

Hence G.L.

I personally know tons of white people who are open to having a constructive dialogue (And I’m sure you do too) THEY are the targets of these types of conversations. G.L and his minions are just the zombie corpses that don’t realize they died out a few years ago.

Sometime you have to draw the G.L types out, so the audience can clearly see who the villain is. So maybe you should thank him for taking the bait?

When are they going to air their dirty laundry and examine their white privilege and white supremacists ideals? When are they going to discuss what THEY can do to end racism?

Constructive dialogue requires an exchange of ideas. What I generally see is black folks talking about their history and how it informs their choices in the present, and white people nodding and saying they understand or don’t, in this case). That’s not constructive, that’s a display.

In fact, who needs a meeting? I can psychically communicate with all blacks to leave no less then a 25% tip at restaurants….. especially if they ask for ranch dressing!

I mean, honestly, we all saw the study that clearly showed that black people are all poor tippers….. wait….. there was NO such study? Then how do we know that the statement“Black people are poor tippers”is true?

…….what…..Anecdotal evidence?!? You mean to tell me that we have no idea if in fact the average Black person is a worse tipper the the average White person!?!
Why, if i WEREN’T an idiot Bigot, than i’d hypothesis that the phenomena of poor tipping involving Blacks that i’d personally witnessed (Remember i have NO stats) was due to the“class”of the people i ran into.
But, sense i am a bigot, i just think that ALL blacks are genetically predisposed to chaos and savagery

Being a waiter at various restaurants thru my 8 yrs of college (don’t ask)…I must admit that black customers were not my favorite…the infamous $2 tip is quite discouraging. But I also received some of my best tips from black guests. Of course when they did I would make a point to show it off to my white counterparts. Partially in hopes that they would see that its not the race of the person that determined how they tip, and partially so they would stop trying to seat all the black folks in my section *smile. But I wanted to show the white waiters that most of the time its because of the service the black patrons got. A lot of white waiters approach a black table with an attitude, and don’t spend enough time, and pretty much try to rush them out of there…then when they get the low tip they are like.. see I knew it. So its the old“the chicken or the egg”scenario. Same with getting a cab and other things where people get tipped for their service. But please people lets stop with the $2 tips!

@Asiyah Please don’t say that b/c there are plenty of black folks that make good money. My parents both have well paying careers my father an engineer my mother a nurse and they tip. I work with plenty of servers that are making the same as me and guess what they are white. It’s not about the income b/c I just waited on a bunch of folks a couple weeks ago that were in town for a NAACP convention and to say least they were all educated, well dressed, and well spoken and I still received not so great tips from them after being ran around. I know I’m a good server b/c my tables love me and still after being told I give great service I look in the book to see a bad tip. It’s not just black people that tip bad believe me, but since this is the topic low income is not the only reason for bad tips and it’s not an excuse. Like I’ve said time and time again there are other options for dining!!

Keep that in mind next time you get a tip that is not up to your standards. Most of my friends, the vast majority of which are black, are all excellent tippers…. or at least they are when they go out with me because I am quick to give them the evil eye if they don’t…but just like we know what a good tip is, we also know what good service is. And the days of generous tipping just to try and dispel the myth that black people don’t tip well is over…You have to come correct!

That’s the thing about these people that I don’t get. If black people are so vile and uncivilized, why do they have websites and forums dedicated to us? Why do they spend so much time discussing us?

We are an outlet for them. The whole slavery thing and Jim Crow thing is very cunning. It gave the lower class white people a sense of power and accomplishment. Instead of realizing just how fked up their lives really are they would instead say, im better than the blacks. This would keep them content because when the lower class gets fed up, thats when revolutions occur…has happened all throughout history…So I hate to say it but this whole racial turmoil that has be embedded on us was quite ingenious, and just as devious…But when blacks started getting their acts together and this mental crutch that the lower class whites relied on so much started to fail they start to get scared, and angry, and hostile. So when a black man became president…ohhhhhh that was such a devastating blow. So yeah they are acting out something terrible now. I too scan the various posts to see the comments…Yahoo is another site where they run rampant with their disgusting comments. But alas let me make it clear that when I say“they”I am not referring to all white people…A lot of them are rooting for us, and want this whole racial facade to end as much as we do…but I am talking about the ones that submit to the mental crutch of believing that they are superior to black people.

I find it hard to believe that Piggy was the quintessential“I’ll be right with you”server. Maybe he didn’t get tipped well because he was being a douche.

I tip based on service, if you’re friendly and don’t disappear for 30 minutes or let my glass sit empty all night (this has happened), most times we’re talking 25-30%. However, I know plenty of people who accept bad service because they’re afraid to complain lest something happen to their food/drink. Maybe this silence is considered as satisfaction and so servers think they deserve a tip when they really don’t.

On the flip side, I know some real cheap bastards. SOme people don’t think bringing food to the table is a big deal so why should they pay you for it, they’re already paying for the food. But these are usually the same people who spend money on luxury items they can’t afford for appearances.

Either way, it’s more about class that it is about race. It just happens that if you’re in a large metropolitan area the class and color lines tend to blend in to each other.“Statistics”aside, I’m sure the same would be found of poorer white in rural neighborhoods.

The part that really grinds my gears is where he says that by asking for things, black customers are just trying to put the server to work. Really?! You think making you hustle for napkins takes precedence over this previously frozen, microwaved strip steak?! Nope. (Some) Black people just like ranch dressing/BBQ sauce and more sauce = more napkins. That’s just logic. Maybe you should anticipate the napkins next time?

And since when since is the customer supposed to be concerned about your time constraints?! Where does that happen? When you call some customer support line, do you care that there are 50 other people in the queue behind you? No. If you choose to work in a service industry, your job is to serve your customers. If you’re really good at it, EVERY customer should feel like they’re your ONLY customer. When your income is based on the generosity of others, you’re compensation is going to vary.

But this sh*t right here:“…Ignoring the economic law that states that more stuff costs more money, the black patrons naturally went into the feigned poverty act that is common among this racial group. Oh Lawdy! and such.”

Negated every logical thing he said prior, because like I said at the beginning, he just seems like a douche.

But I’ve been doing this for a while so I know what they’re most likely going to ask for. I double-check and make sure that their steaks are cooked extra well done. I ask if they want extra sauce on their salad. In truth, I bend over backwards because I have this innate desire to be liked by the people I wait on. It is probably this realization that I am doing much more to accomodate this particular subset of the population (while still receiving worse tips on average and worse treatment on average) that has me irked.

So..basically what you’re doing is YOUR JOB! Bending over backwards, making sure the food is prepared to the desired specification of the customer etc. Its what you were hired to do. I dont think it has anything to do with your desire to be liked. Just my personal opinion..You’re being pleasant because one, you most likely depend on your job and two, tips = extra money. I’ll admit, the most I’ll tip is $5 which I believe is fair considering my bill is never over $30. I’ve received horrible service from both blacks and whites and will still leave a tip of $1.

I just don’t give a sht what random non-black people think about me and mine.

While most racists look for justifications for their vast ignorance, they don’t need much to fuel their hatred. You can’t control how people think, only how you react/respond to it. So I let them hate and live their miserable little lives as long as they are not affecting me directly.

I resent the fact that I have to be on my best behavior constantly for fear of putting my entire race in a bad light. I’d like to be able to have a bad day without being label a typical angry black woman or just another nigg@ that doesn’t know how to act civilized.

But I do it anyway. Because that is what I’m expected to do and I wouldn’t want to bring down my entire race with one smart ass comment or even a frown.

Now if was a Real Househo or Jump Shot Jump-Off, I could be as ignorant as I wanted to be and get paid for it. Go figure.

At some point, we have to stop trying to prove ourselves to people. White, black, or whatever. Its just futile. Clearly, the discussion turned to an examination of our below average intelligence and free loading spirit. Despite the evidence, which I dont feel a need to list, they still came to these conclusions. Again, these conclusions were made in spite of FACTS. There is no discussion to be had unless you feel like talking to yourself.

We need to find freedom and confidence in knowing who we are so that we arent distracted by the likes of G.L. Piggy.

I totally agree! However, this is easier said than done. The long history of Europe/America in a position of power has set up a paradigm where we MUST prove ourselves to them on may occasions. Due to the fact that we are more often than not the employed instead of the employer puts us in an unfortunate position. Moreover, because of this lack of individual power we have had to come together as group to be heard. I think this has worked for and against us. Together we have a louder voice but this togetherness has caused all to be held accountable for another’s actions. If I do something ignorant. I am not ignorant but because I am a reflection of my race, all black people are ignorant. It’s just too much pressure but it’s very hard to shake the feeling that I am representing not myself, but my race to the world. I know I should ignore ignorant comments but I have this need to prove to people that we are not all loud, ghetto,impoverished and vile.It’s an uphill battle that I know is useless to fight.

And there it is…a discussion about what race of people tips more or less turned into black people being inferior and ignorant, as does every other discussion these days…smh…

at the end of the day, this isn’t worth the attention. and i went and read his so called“response”to this on his blog. the comments posted are disgusting. it’s funny how over and over i kept seeing“black people are stupid…black people are ignorant…black people are this and that”, but i am struggling to find comments here degrading and disrespecting other races in the same way. even the responses to his own comments here are not in such a disgusting tone. just another thing that goes to show that some things are just not going to change in this country. oh well, i keep on living…

I’m sure everyone on this website can give an example of bad service from a white server. The difference is we will assume that individual person an ASSHOLE and not decide that ALL white servers are racist assholes. The fact that there even would be a study about black people being bad tippers seems to be a justification to you, but to me it’s just ridiculousness.

**Disclaimer: I’m neither American, nor do I live in America. But I am Black.
I’m South African, my experiences differ somewhat, but not really.

I have recieved really horrible treatment from white waiters\waitresses. And I’m a great tipper. Regardless of treatment, I tip.
My friends reckon I’m a bleeding heart, plus I was a waitress at one point in my life, so I understand the struggle.

Interestingly enough, wait staff in Michelin starred restaurants are mostly white, so horrible treatment for black patrons is standard. I guess we do not deserve any sympathy, huh?

Your problem is you want to be right. Almost everyone on this site has said they’re great tippers, at times tipping more than the norm. But you are not having it. Ask yourself why? Not saying you are racist, but why are you not giving anyones opinion credence?

“When everyone notices the same thing perhaps its time to accept the truth and look inward.”

Truth is, your empirical evidence is no more valid than each commenter’s testimony that states the opposite of your claims. Truth is, I know more Black people around me who make a NOTE to tip well (IF the service warrants it…you just don’t get a good tip for showing the eff up, sorry…customer service swag) than not. Hell, I got a tip calculator APP (with various degrees of percentages depending on the level of service). I know about the waiter industry. I know that most of their salary is dependent on it (which, if this is the case…waiters are expected to ACT like they want said tip and work for it)…I know the ridiculous pay-per-hour they receive DUE to the fact that they have tips…I know that they also have to share their tips with the busboys/bartenders on the same bill. What I DON’T know…and will never accept, is some fragglenackle bull that bad service is a mostly Black thing. Know why? Because I don’t live under a rock.
 Reply ↓ Colby on 08/18/2011 at 9:46 am said: 
You know, there are many things about your point I hesitate to agree with, but I will share my perspective.

My father is a bad tipper. I often sneak a few extra dollars in at dinner or have to steal the check before he gets it and tell him how much to leave before he sees the tab. But this is because he’s cheap, not because he’s Black (by the way, out of curiosity, Jewish peopple are stereotyped as being notoriously cheap, are they bad tippers too?). My dad is cheap and doesn’t really care. I think Black people have more of a i don’t give a ish attitude about things:”i don’t give a ish i want my steak well done””I don’t give a ish, I need ketchup at my table”. We just want things our way, are unapologetic about it, and are not afraid to be assertive and even impolite about it. I have a few white friends and during dinner outings they are more likely to let things go and be passive about things. I guess they care a lot more about how they’ll be perceived.

My dad is in his 60′s and when he was my age, he was not entitled to good service at a restaurant from white people. In fact, he was not entitled to any service at many places. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t have a chip on his shoulder about it, but I understand Champ’s argument about Black people conforming to a social norm in a country where 50 years ago the societal norm was to treat Black people waaay less than equal. Do I think we should eventually get over it? Yes. Do I sympathize with people who choose to not respect/appreciate/understand that plight? No.

Jeez I’m so tired of having to watch my back all the time and having to be the one to rise above in social settings. I try to always make sure I leave a generous tip. Even when I took my little brother out to a burger joint recently I left a good tip. I saw my server twice the whole time, the food wasn’t spectacular but I left a tip worth half of the check. Why because I was taught that people work hard and deserve reward. I’m a struggling college student. I barely have money myself but I still gave something. Seriously though. I LOVE rap music ( and ALL other kinds of music for that matter), but I hear people bash it all the time and I dont speak up about some of the really talented artists I enjoy because I dont want to be judged. I like tennis shoes I like Spike Lee. I like doing alot of things which some believe is specific to my race, but I’m afriad to voice it because I don’t want to be a steryotype. I’m sick of being little miss voice of a generation. I try and live by the motto of being the best PERSON I can be but still people will judge. I wonder if its not me who needs to do the changing.
At the same time I cant identofy with the struggles of every black person and I feel even worse if I dont feel the same reaction as them to a certain event or action. My own people question me for not liking Tyler perry movies for not crying when Obama got elected (not necassarily real examples, but you get it) I just feel like the more I try to be my own good person the more shunned I am for not fitting completely into one category.

I let it slide once, and it continued for a week until I put a stop to it. I was taught to tip for good service, but my (white) friend ALWAYS tips 20%.

“Or maybe black people can start tipping better and stop being pains in the ass in restaurants. Thats the problem. Today the onus is placed on whites to change and bend to the whim of blacks. Why? Do you actually think that this is all white peoples fault or problem? Could it not be that blacks have a part to play in this discourse and should understand why whites hold such negative views in certain settings?”

OK, this is where I tap out…and I kindly ask my fellow VSBers to do the same…
This is NOT a constructive talk about why or if black people are bad tippers
This is NOT a open discussion on the merits of service
This is NOT dialogue about the perception of black people in food service and how we can change it

NO

This has somehow turned into a platform for G.L. Piggy to spew his one-sided misconstrued assumptions

People like him come into a conversation with his own ideals and nothing you can say can dissuade him or ellicit an enlightened conversation where both parties walk away more learned than before…

He is on here to rile you up and the twist your statements to fit whatever agenda he hopes to promote

You Know what I’m black and I tip well..i don’t know why some black people don’t…i don;t know why some white, asian, indian, etc people don’t either….if you have a problem..ASK THEM

HERES A TIPs for you G.L. Piggy:::Since you seem so willing to vocalize how you feel about certain patrons…Next time a table gets up and leaves you with a subpar tip..catch them on their way out and ask them politely why they left the tip they did? was it because of the service? Was the food not to standard? Was there something in the atmospher/ambience not to their liking…
Maybe then you can collect data for REAL personal research..then you can construct an argument that can be remotely substantiated…

In the meantime…I won’t stoop to your level and resort to personal generalizations…what I will say is this is the last time I will address you..You have proven in your very brief time here that you are incapable of having a constructive conversation…and to be honest I’m not sure why you’re here other than to spew stupid“facts”and unfair racist generalizations…in other words…You are dead to me

1. How often (if ever) have you received what you consider poor service at a restaurant?(i.e. had to wait longer than other patrons to be seated, to order, to receive food, etc.)
2. Did you grow up an environment where money was generally spent freely or carefully?
3. How much (if at all do you tip?)

1. Quite a few times, but never enough to eliminate a tip, just enough to lower it a bit. I get really thirsty and if my glass stays empty too long I get irate
2. Money was spent very carefully, we ate out less than 10 times a year (and that’s a high number, probably closer to 5)
3. I love to tip excellent waiters. If you crack jokes, you could be looking at 20-25%, if I stay thirsty, 10%. But i never leave without tipping something. Ay cheapo restaurants like denny’s i just round up so a 8.50 tab becomes $10

 Reply ↓ B. Brown on 08/18/2011 at 7:37 am said: 
1. Not very often, I’d say 5% of the time.
2. Yes.
3. Usually, it’s whatever makes the next full dollar on the total bill after 15% but it may be a bit more. Depends on service.

That said, in general…I think if I received bad service at a restaurant now (sufficiently poor to not receive a tip), I’d talk to the server and a manager and explain why a tip would be unwarranted.
 Reply ↓ miss t-lee on 08/18/2011 at 9:36 am said: 
1. A few times, but it is not often the norm. I try not to take personal, unless it is obviously personal. If the service is that bad off top, I normally leave instead of spending my money in said establishment.
2. carefully
3. normally 20%, if the service is exceptional, often more.
Only twice in my life have I left no tip. It was the worse service I’ve ever recieved, therefore I paid for my meal. That’s that.

1. I’ve gotten poor service alot…to the point I thought it was me. Like did my facial expression say something cuz I promise I was smiling when I walked in. I can’t help it…I like food and the thought of eating good makes me happy…like ready to hum a diddy and do a shuffle happy. Usually when I have bad service, I call the customer service number on the receipt or the comment card. I leave my comments/ratings and go on about my day/evening. I am not the best in public confrontations so I tend to avoid those.
2. Money wasn’t spent freely or carefully. I was always raised that Money is a means of exchange and to treat it as such. So if I wanted something and I had the money…exchanges were definitely happening. If not…guess I was really just window shopping then.
3. I generally base my tip solely on quality of service and quality of food. You get 10-15% (i was unemployeed for the last few years i’m still catching up…. so i rarely eat out but when i do…i tip what I can afford) and it goes up or down based on the quality of service and quality of food.

*anecdote* On a visit to Macaroni Grill in DC, my best friend wanted to treat me to dinner. It was a group of 5 so I was like nah we can hit up a burger joint or something but he insisted. Now our original server was a new young lady to the job. She had only waited on one other table by herself before ours…so we did our best to make her feel at ease and to not be anxious or nervous. But for some reason…after we asked for menus…. she never came back. Like straight just got ghost on us. We were sitting there for like 30 mins. Like I went to the bar and the greeter and my bestie went to the kitchen to try to find our waitress. So they sent over a“seasoned”waitress. We could all tell that she was trying to overcompensate for the previous waitress but it failed. She was soooooooooooooooooooo loud and obnoxious and doing 35hundred much. It was to the point that I was like forget the food, finish the appetizers and lets go. She wasn’t rude or anything. But in her zeal she completely turned the whole table off. We all still tipped her (she made at least $60 on a $130 tab) but I did let her know that she didn’t have to“try so hard”.

I’ve had a few notable bad experiences and acted accordingly (either decreased or flat-out NOT given one, depending on how bad), but for the most part I’ve received great service. And I am KNOWN for tipping well. Hell, I’ve had more than a couple convos with servers about bad tipping and they personally thanked me (and my family/group) for not being stingy with the tips.

2. I’d say it was a combo of both. We spent it carefully in that we certainly weren’t able to be frivolous, but when we did go out to fancier restaurants/places, we knew how to act. lol Like, my attitude has always been“you get what you pay for.”If it’s WORTH it (and of course, this can be subjective), I have no qualms about paying big bucks.

3. I’ve done 15% (with extra for the servers that were the BOMB) most of my adult life, but after having read about the increase to 20%, I try my best to do that most of the time.

1. How often (if ever) have you received what you consider poor service at a restaurant?–5-10% of the time going out to eat?
2. Did you grow up an environment where money was generally spent freely or carefully? Freely…
3. How much (if at all do you tip?)–Pre- adult working days, less than 15% if at all, post adult working days (and once I was aware of how much waitstaff typically makes) 15-20%…these days I usually tip around 20% standard. If service is SO bad that I’m considering not tipping, then I would speak to the management about it, so they were aware of the problems I experienced.

1. I had just one experience with hair, and one experience where our waiter got lost for 35 minutes and even the other staff didn’t know what happened to him. The armpit thing felt more like someone who would probably have bad table manners and I have friends eaten with folks who have that problem, so I don’t consider that bad service just bad manners. The fingers on the rim thing wasn’t mine it was my dining partners, and it upset them not me ( I always use a straw when out) So in total it looks like 3 times, which represents probably less than 0.01% of my experience.
2. Umm carefully
3. 18% for just regular service, 15% for sub par, 20+% for great service. I probably only left without a tip when the service meant I was unable to eat my meal. As in I didn’t eat. I have left a tip on one of those occasions, because it wasn’t the servers fault. The food was inedible but she was excellent at her job, the cook just sucked. I also make it a point that if I am comped something or am provided a discount that I tip on the amount before the discount is given.

like any other stereotype, people are going to just search for it in order to notice it. most of the people i know tip well, unless the service is bad. if you’re doing a good job, then you get a tip, other than that you don’t. it’s that simple. tipping is not a requirement, it’s a reward for doing a good job. i’m willing to bet money that the man in that article probably treated his black patrons worse than he did his white patrons, because he already had the mindset that they will not tip, be rude, picky, etc. i had some friends who worked in restaurants in my college town, which was predominantly white who said they were barely tipped, so what explanation does the waiter have there? i had other friends who worked in country clubs, who said they were not tipped there either. country clubs are also predominantly white.
i’m usually very apprehensive about talking to white people about race matters because they usually brush issues under the rug under the guise of being p.c., claim we’re overreacting, or something along these lines. i’m not saying they are all racist, because that would be crazy, but they do, as all people do, still have to explore their race relations and actually be able to truthfully assess their thoughts and opinions on other races. until more people start to do that, we will continue to have instances like these.

If I were a server in this current economic environment, I would be thrilled to have enough patrons to warrant my employ and to keep the restaurant open. That aside, I’ve been black for 31 years and a few months, I’ve been cheap for the majority of that time and I don’t intend to change. However, I am fair when it comes to tipping and I tip ~15% regardless of what I order. However, I tip less if the service is bad, i.e., disrespectful wait staff, long wait time, etc. On the flip side I will tip 20% for excellent service. In ADDITION, I will tell friends about the restaurant so that they will patronize said restaurant as well.

I don’t understand the purpose of all the emotion behind people’s posts or their responses to folks like Piggy. I wield my economic power easily and frequently. I don’t have to patronize establishments with routinely rude servers who prejudge me. I can eat at home or with friends at their homes or I can eat at“black”restaurants. I’m sure black restaurants would love the money and the patronage. You have options people. Exercise them.

“While they interpret our pickiness and occasional animosity towards servers as entitlement, its really just distrust distrust of white establishments, distrust of the food made by white cooks, distrust of white peoples ultimate intentions, etc”&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why dont you black folks“AFRICAN-americans”go to your own restaurants??? If thats the reason…you go to white restaurants to try prove yourself in the American society. Problem is, you suffer from inferiority complex and lack of proper education (since most of you drop out anyway) and your use of English grammar is wanting. I read about“black culture”from the african american point of view and with all said and done, you are not at all Black in culture. Culture to you has lost its meaning. You give the entire Black race a bad name and you are but a very small percentage of the entire race in the world. So suck it up..make the best of it and stop feeling sorry for your poor asses!!! If you want a solution, go to school!!! And as for your black women fearing the white girls…they should since most of them are bitter and no one can stand that sh*t…and no am not white…

Funny think is I think this has been an exercise in missing the point. JUst as your Good Men post about racial neurosis became an article about black people tipping, this article about dirty laundry became an article about black people tipping.

In reference to the main post though, I get your point. When I see youtube comments like Wyte powrrrr, i think ok, whatever, he probably wears overalls has two teeth and lives in a trailer park (tolerant of me, i know) but when I see posts that are carefully crafted with good grammar and a writing style that expresses a certain level of education, it is disheartening. Maybe the same people in the dining hall that sit with or next to me in the lecture hall, secretly have well crafted, pseudo intellectual racists viewpoints. That’s a scary thought because these are my future coworkers, business contacts, or bosses. How do you combat this kind of racism?
 Reply ↓ CJ on 08/18/2011 at 5:35 am said: 
I would wager that the one factor that plays in here is that servers in most restaurants depend on tips to get their wages up to minimum wage. Most people don’t get that, regardless of race. People think it’s meant to be a reward for service well done. It’s not. It’s a part of the cost of your service.

Wed rather not air our dirty laundry around white people, and were slightly amazed, shocked, and embarrassed by those who do.

The problem is we know who we are and we also know what others do.

We all have that friend we cant take to that hot reservation only restaurant because we know that we are going to lose the reservation because they wont seat until we are all there and even though this person will be over an hour late, they are going to get loud about not being seated and everyone in the group will be painted with the ignorant black folks on CP time brush.

Even though its a one out of six situation…because we are seen as a monolith.

And we dont want to discuss this in mixed company because we know the consequence is a fear that the next time we call to make that reservation we wont be taken seriously because of an experience they had with another black person.

And when we dont get the reservation, we wonder if they are really booked or did something in our voice reveal that we were black and we have to suffer because of that other black person was late and ignorant.

Hence the racial neurosis.

The funny thing is I personally dont think about it all that much but then something will happen that makes me raise an eyebrow, sometimes its just for a split second and wonder…

Did I just have a racist run in.

Most of the time we blow it off because it doesnt matter we got more important stuff to do than deal with the possibility of other folks baggage.

Sometimes we over compensate because we want to prove we are different…the exception to disprove the rule and change the prejudice to some form of acceptence.

And sometimes we get caught wrong, and we get sick of having to smile at what is obvious white prejudice and somebody gets told.

But regardless of individual reactions, I think we all want to know is…

What will it take before we are completely seen as individuals ~JS

UGH, I don’t even know where to begin w/ this one…

I’m a reformed“bad tipper”myself, had no clue about the crappy wages until I actually waited tables myself…

as a waiter I came to find out that, like all stereotypes, some of us act a fool in restaurants–not all, but some. Maybe it depends on the area you’re in&amp;the kind of folks that come through, but when I received bad tips or no tips it was most likely from a Black patron. I haaaate it, but this was my experience. There’s many reasons for it, but the result is the same…

Here’s the thing though–its just DUMB to assume all Black patrons are gonna treat you bad&amp;stiff you. As many times as I was“ran”&amp;“stiffed”I put forth the same face for all my customers&amp;aimed to please b/c that’s the job–you never know how a person is gonna do you, Black or White, lawyer or janitor. Letting that bias rule you feeds your own bad energy&amp;contributes to the diner’s experience with you, be it positive or negative (so go for the positive&amp;hope for the best, or find a new line of work!). It also seemed to boil down to a class issue within the Black community–not how much $ you have, but how you carry yourself. You know–having actual class, money can’t buy that (&amp;often makes classless folks more of a terror)…

I still run across folks who don’t believe in fair tipping but I try to educate,&amp;then compensate if all else fails. I’m probably guilty of being overly polite to servers b/c I know the bias exists&amp;I want them to feel like they’re gonna get a tip from me,&amp;therefore be encouraged to provide the best service they can for me. Yes, it’s unfair that I have the burden of reassuring my waiter, but that’s the climate–I pick my battles, this ain’t one (most of the time)…

bottom line–racism sucks,&amp;so does not tipping. hit the drive-through, ya cheap bastids!

This is ironic, in that I had a related experience last week. I wrote something on FB about a 2520 with…umm, a ratio unseen…and referred to her as a snowflake. One of my HS classmates took exception, which I had no issue with. Led me to write a piece (which was quite lengthy) about black people and race consciousness. Whole thing was a learning experience that I appreciated going through.

We all have to live together, so it might make sense to learn to…well…live together. In a world–a nation, at least–with rising numbers of interracial relationships, multiracial children, and (y’all know who gets mentioned here due to current job title); getting along with others outside our race will be increasingly vital to our own existence. It’s about more than just being the right thing to do, which it is. It also makes social, economic, and political sense.

Last year i got a side gig doing tax returns and black people always fist pumped when they walked to my desk expecting me to hit them with every loophole like im Mr. Incredible. The thing is subconsciously when i see black people acting up around 2520s i’m embarrassed for them. Go to the ESPN stories on black athletes bein arrested and you see a bunch of white people smhing calling us thugs (which imo is becoming the new n-word for an educated black man like myself).

The honesty of the blogger and commenters referred to in the article are actually refreshing because they allow for an honest conversation about race. This is one of the“benefits”IMO of this new“post-racial’Obama world (sarcasm). White people tend to be so upset about everything that they’ve disposed with niceties and begun telling us how they really feel because they honestly believe there status is under attack. Its funny, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Historically, Jim Crow and other laws used to disenfranchise or delegitimize black folks were founded on some of the same principles these commenters used in bolstering their“theories.”

Much of the verve for their opinion comes from conversations they have had with other black servers as the author alluded to. This is why we (black folk) keep our guard up around white people and don’t air our proverbial dirty laundry. White people have a strong tendency to take a conversation with their one black friend/co-worker/associated and extrapolate and apply that conversation to every black person they encounter. I always follow this philosophy…never take sides against the family (I’m a firm believer that everything I need to know in life was covered in the Godfather Trilogy…digression ended). This principle is why you probably won’t see my ever discredit Obama in an open forum. Not that I dont have critiques, but I’ll be d@mned if I give anyone any sort of ammunition. H*ll, I rarely say anything about Clarence Thomas to white people.

Anyway, I see G.L. Piggy has made an appearance here, and it doesn’t surprise me that he seems to have either missed or just outright ignored the point, again.

While black people and tipping is a multi-layered issue, neither this nor my original post at the GMP is about that. I could really give less than two f*cks about whether black people leave 10% or 27%.

My issue is how (when a number of a certain type of white people are involved) quickly a discussion about tipping or crime or Kobe or Obama or ground meat or whatever always devolves into“let’s look at all the ways black people are inherently inferior to not only us but everybody else.”

But, don’t mind me. Continue your straw man arguments, Gucci Little Piggy, and continue refusing to address why you and many of your ilk put so much energy into“proving”the inferiority of a people who only represent 13% of the population here, and I’ll continue eating at restaurants (and leaving generous tips) instead of seating and serving people at them.

I agree. Tipping was the last issue I read as the focus of the article. The real issue is this feeling of threat white people (or the establishment) feel toward black america. Obama’s ascension to the Presidency has only hastened their anxiety. Now, they feel comfortable enough to speak their (true) minds. I for one am excited about the prospect because now we can have a real conversation about race instead of this PC garbage people like to spew. Funny thing is, the more liberal white folks often hold some of the most damaging opinions.

I was just thinking that everyone got distracted by the inflammatory ish being tossed around instead of actually addressing the topic at hand. That proves your point though. The actions of a group of folks that happen to frequent certain types of restaurants is selection bias, but has somehow become a norm. I’ll assume that Applebee’s and a French bistro have different clientele. I’ll leave that dead horse alone now. As for the neurosis, I know that it’s always on my mind and part of it is a numbers game. For lack of a better word, I’m an outlier so are my friends and I’d bet that a lot of VS people are too. Education, employment, and socioeconomically we’re probably in a different situation than the majority of black people. Most of us probably interact with white folks more regularly than a lot of black people. I’d even guess that those same white folks have limited interaction with black people. White folks’perceptions are going to be based on who they know (probably a handful of black people) and prevailing images . We may be hypersensitive, but I don’t know how we wouldn’t be because we generally are the representative if you will. As said rep, it’s confusing when our actions, preferences, etc aren’t in line with the prevailing image. Goes back to the whole notion of blackness. We get credit for MLK, but we also get credit for Pookie Qualocious Jackson on Maury. I guess it comes with the territory.

You brought up the topic at GMP to which I responded. The reason that“Eating While Black”exists is because of“Not Tipping While Black”. So–in the realm of tipping–blacks, as a group, are inferior.

From there, we search for reasons to explain why this is so.

That’s exactly right, Malik. 2520 folks don’t have a real understanding of racism beyond using racial slurs and segregation. They don’t see how racism undergirds the very being of this nation and that it is intertwined throughout the fabric of our society. They don’t understand the invisible nature of it because they are not negatively impacted by it. They believe in the merit system because they have no reason to believe otherwise. If the folks who know and understand are unable to be courageous enough to engage the folks who don’t know and don’t understand, then we will continue to be stuck in this 1960s brand of racial dialogue forever.

Those people who have commented may deny that there are any psychological factors involved but little do they know that they are showcasing said causes of psychological factors WITH the comments they left.

I’m of the mindset that you can always find some study to support what you believe.

For example, if I believed that Democrats were better tippers than Republics, than this study would prove it:

 http://www.mediacurves.com/Culture/J7822-TippingStudy/ 

My point is, don’t put too much credence in random studies, especially ones that haven’t been scrutinized and duplicated by others.

I’d have to agree with most other posters here, that G.L. Piggy is simply self-fulfilling his prophecy: he sees black patrons, (whether consciously or unconsciously) gives poor service, and then receives a poor tip. After reading his numerous comments, I’d personally be offended if he was my waiter and instantly assumed, after seeing my complexion, that obviously I’ll want extra ranch dressing on my salad, my steak well-done, and whatever else he thinks all black folks are notorious for.

And FYI, I always tip 20% as a rule of thumb, even if the service is piss-poor. Unfortunately, no waiter will know this until after the meal is over and by then, it’s too late to rectify the sub-par service they probably already gave me simply because I’m black.

“If you strive for excellence then, maybe, ultimately you can get beyond the the shadow of race and transcend the ways in which people may limit you because of your background.”

I watched a few interviews of hers yesterday after finishing the book, and this statement stuck with me. I believe that it’s true. There are always gonna be people who stereotype and hate us and want to keep us down, but we don’t have to let them have any power over us. Just be excellent and shut them up. Constantly stimulate and cultivate your mind, and do your absolute best at whatever you do. They may not like or understand you, but if you truly are the sh!t, you’ll ultimately transcend the hateration. Life, especially in America, is about survival of the fittest. Because of people who think like this Piggy character, we may have to work twice as hard as the whiteys, but that’s just the hand we’ve been dealt. Keep your eyes on the prize, guys. Stay up

“we may have to work twice as hard as the whiteys, but thats just the hand weve been dealt.”

This right here is the bottom line. I tell folks all the time,“I don’t live in should. I live in is. Most black and brown folks do.”What that means is that we don’t have the privilege of worrying about what should be. We have to live our best lives based on what is and in doing so, strive for a better“is”for our children. Yesterday Champ used the same analogy I always use in illustrating this point. He said that he should not have to lock his car to ensure that no one breaks into it, but basically he does lock it up because he understands what it is. People of color have been dealt a particular hand in this society. That is just a fact. However, we do not have to accept it as our lot in life. If we work our a$$es off, and keep on working, we can rise above the hand we’ve been dealt.

I think both parties keep their respectives masks up. Since we only make up less than 13% of the population, we measure our words carefully to prevent ourselves from being isolated and cut off from upward mobility opportunities. IMO whites do the same think for fear of a comment(s) being taken for racist and recieving the scarlet letter treatment.

It’s sad because in certain situations, I’ve got to keep the mask up when dealing with us!…Friend or for who you with?

I worked as a hostess at a popular restaurant in D.C. Prior to my hostess experience I thought I was a good tipper but I quickly found out that I was wrong! I learned why tipping is imperative, and once I realized that servers tip out the entire restaurant it changed my mentality. Call it selfish or whatever suits you…

Yes, I think some of“us”feel entitled to superior service but do not tip well, but others simply do not know proper restaurant etiquette.

The responses to G.L Piggy’s article were quite appalling, but not surprising. Racism is still very much alive. The scariest thing is when people are clueless about it.

****Yes, I think some of us feel entitled to superior service but do not tip well, but others simply do not know proper restaurant etiquette.****

I guess what I would note here is that whether some feel entitled to it or not, it must be rendered before it can be rewarded. If I don’t get superior service (which should be perfunctory just in keeping with good business practices) don’t expect a superior tip.

-If I have to ask for things repeatedly–don’t expect a superior tip–I’m not getting superior service
-If I request a steak cooked medium and it comes back well done because you forgot to tell them–don’t expect a superior tip–I’m not getting superior service
-If I have to wait 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by a waiter–don’t expect a superior tip–I’m not getting superior service
-If my drinks and appetizers arrive AFTER my food–don’t expect a superior tip–I’m not getting superior service

None of this directed at you personally Erica, I’m just saying that this is my mindset. I am not rewarding poor service simply because the waiter feels they’re entitled to my money, just by showing up.

So after perusing through the comments, I have no idea what the discussion is.

I’m black. I always tip 15%-20%. A person would have to go out of his/her way for me to tip less. As far as black people being tempermental…some of us are and some aren’t. Perhaps service providers are hyper-sensitive to black people’s behavior because it’s our favorite steretype- the angry black person.

I acknowledge the need to code switch but I hang out with black people so“airing dirty laundry”around white people is neither here nor there. Maybe I’ve decided I just don’t fcuk with white people like that. Perhaps there is a tendency to not be as open with white people thus preventing good friendships from being made; I recognize that. So it doesn’t matter if white people think I’m angry or a bad tipper or hair above retarded because our interactions will be limited from jump. This topic makes me feel depressed, LOL.

Additional two cents at no charge:
And may I also add that black peoples’“way”, if you will, tends to be more harsh sounding although there may be little or no harshness behind what is being said. I’ve often seen something said jokingly, or in a“ball-busting”manner be taken to another level because it was said by a black person and someone didn’t understand it wasn’t that serious. I think sometimes only other black people get the joke- like, we’re not really that mad we’re just saying what’s on our mind at the moment.

Whites will never have honest dialouge with us out of fear being labeled racist (fairly or unfairly).
Any attempt to have such a discussion will be futile until whites admit that white privilege exists and it tends to not fully take your plight into full consideration.
Code switching will increase as self preservation amongst cultures increases.

Very quickly, I’ll start by saying this post is NOTHING that I thought it was going to be. I think this was said by several readers. However, its good to be surprised at some thing you read, b/c it sort of doesn’t happen that much.

I think there’s a couple of reasons that people“not Black people solely”tip poorly:
1) People want to eat out but they don’t want to pay gratuity on top of a meal. Very simple.
2) If you have a history of receiving craptacular service at a restaurant, you’re already going to be biased toward a low tip.
3) People are cheap (more often than not) by their general nature.

Those 3 reasons have NOTHING to do with race.

The only difference that I’ve noticed (and this has been stated as well) is that Black people tend to be more vocal than others are.

Case Study: My wife and I went to Papadeaux in Houston on Saturday. 45 minute wait? No problem. We got seated. The waiter came over, we already knew what we wanted. Easy for him, right? Wait for it….We asked for two small saucers, never received him. I asked for a refill on water, never got it. The couple sitting in front us (also Black) received a tray of bread or some thing…never received it. In fact, I had to ask another server for a few things, and I didn’t request any damn ranch dressing.

Point is, some times there are @$$holes that come into restaurants. But if you have those types of experiences, subsequently do not tip well…the waiter/ress is not going to look at their own performance as the reasoning for why their tip is low…they’ll assume its b/c you’re Black.

 Reply ↓ Todd on 08/18/2011 at 9:33 am said: 
I got a few thing I want to mention based on this post. First, the older I get, the more I realize the expression of racism (as opposed to the institution of racism in our social systems) is based in fear and anxiety. While this guy is a bigot, he could very easily be afraid of, say, pollution, the Dallas Cowboys or red meat. I also know that he has a lot of pain expressed on his own blog about how his pops rolled out on him as a young child, and how he still feels pain with that. I think he uses the social construct of Whiteness to give him that stability he lacked as a child, because he couldn’t have it in his family situation.

To relate back to the Champ’s point, I think this ironically dovetails nicely with the post from yesterday about approaching members of the opposite sex. Why? Because I think a lot of the same emotions are involved, but just with higher stakes when it comes to race. I think that Black people have internalized a lot of hate from the world and come to believe that they’re fundamentally“less-than”and it reflects in all we do…down to stuff like restaurant service. On the flip side, I think that a lot of White people are ignorant of our struggle, and when we express that fear, it can get thrown back in our face. Throw in the fact that the vast majority of White racists these days come from unstable situations. Either they’re working-class and lower (with all the attendant“hood tendencies”like the Black people full of self-hate) or they’re White people who just crept up on a come-up and haven’t solidified their elite status yet. (I could go in on the latter, but this isn’t the forum for that.) I think Malcolm X was right when he said that the one thing White people can do for Black people is nothing. Yes, we need White people to change the institution of racism, if only because we live in a democracy and they’re the majority of voters. However, with the expression thereof, we have to take care of it ourselves.

In my experience, I have no problems airing the dirty laundry of our people. I’ve had other Black people act shocked that I am so comfortable talking to White people on that level. Why am I comfortable? Because I know that fundamentally, I have the same worth as them, with all the attendant strengths and flaws. I’m not better-than or less-than anyone. I am as human as anyone else.

Now in my mid-twenties, I’ve come to feel this way as well. I’m just me and I try to be that way in front of any and all. I know enough White people to know that their ish stinks too and they are no more human than I. I would also agree that this post does relate back to yesterday’s topic on Black men approaching women. In the end, I think fear, like you said, is the MAIN issue involved.

this topic is really about social graces.

while other may think“blacks are jerks”, it’s about knowing better and then doing better. my colleague just admitted to me that when she was growing up, she believed that tipping was optional–not because she is a“jerk”–but because her family lived in the South and only started visiting restaurants in the 70s. she simply didn’t know that tipping was a standard and that employees of restaurants lived on tips. nothing to do with her being a jerk, she simply hadn’t been‘taught the rules’.

i used to work at a theatre in Detroit—and not a movie theatre—a live theatre. well, we’d have‘urban plays’and some black folks would roll up 30 mins to an hour late and expect to be seated immediately OR would knowingly by a ticket for Wednesday night only to attend the night they really wanted—Saturday. so they argue with us about why they couldn’t be seated or why they wouldn’t check their fur coat yet instead lay it on the seat next to them (that belonged to a paying customer).

anyhoo–it wasn’t because they are black–it was because they didn’t know any better. social graces.

there would be a whole auditorium full of black folks (about 2000) who arrived ON TIME, paid to check their coat, didn’t try to sneak in liquor, and didn’t ignore all the rules. but there be that one or two in the crowd that would spoil it for everyone else.

But whenever they find hairs or plastic (at an amazingly high rate) or if their food isnt prepared to their liking, you pretty much have to drop everything to cater to them. Its really like waiting on infants

Wait so who are these white people that aren’t saying anything about hair and plastic in their food. I mean that’s pretty gross to me. All people should speak up when there is a foreign object in their food. Also, why wouldn’t a person want food made to their liking. If I don’t like mayo and find it disgusting and you put mayo on my sandwich why would I eat that. That just sounds dumb to me. This seems like standard service to me. Btw, I always tip between 15%–20%.

Whenever we as black folks tip well even though the service sucks, go out of our way to be early for some event that we KNOW will likely start late, make sure that we are super on point when we present at work, sit in the front of the class and make sure that the professor knows our name, we typically do so because of what Claude Steele calls“stereotype threat.”Stereotype threat is the idea that people of color purposely over compensate or try to be super on point because we believe that the people around us are very much aware of the sterotypes that are often attributed to us. As a result, we believe that if we make one false move, have one hair our of place, speak one improperly conjugated verb, arrive one minute late, have one typo on the handout, doze off for 30 seconds in that classroom, we will essentially be reinforcing said stereotypes, which is the LAST thing we want to do. Steele says that this is what’s often at the root of the racial anxiety we feel in certain settings and is also the reason why we might be off our game even when we know we came prepared to ball. Sometimes we can be so concerned with making the right impression and dispelling the myths and stereotypes that our anxiety gets the best of us and we eff up royally. Steele’s research is pretty incredible, particularly when looking at student achievement data.

This was quite an involved blog post. You went from here to there and then over there, but surprisingly I followed you all the way there.

When i think of the tipping phenomenon, I remember my days as a server. While there are certainly many black folks who simply don’t tip because they believe it’s“extra”, there are many others who don’t. The most consistent policy for ensuring that you receive a decent tip most of the time, is to give quality service ALL the time.

Often, black folks are used to getting sub par service because servers, assuming that they won’t tip, give them bad service. But when you treat people who aren’t used to be treating well, they almost always look out. I treated every guest of mine like they were a senator or at least a B-list celebrity when they were seated in my section and I made better tips as a college student than many veterans. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. You expect people to give you a bad tip, so you give them bad service…and they give you a bad tip. You expect people to reward you handsomely, so you treat them well…and they (usually) give you a great tip!

I’m going to consider sharing this post with my white roommate; see if it will provide some clarity for her.

Thanks for the post.

I worked in the food industry for a good 10 years, starting at the age of 16. When I was hostess at a major chain restaurant in downtown DC, this Black waiter (especially if it was near rent is due time) used to tell us,“give me white people. Nothing but white people in my section! I need to make money today.”He was dead ass serious.

Fast forward to my waitressing experiences and I can say that non tipping knows no race, color, creed, economic status, and on. I’ve had a damn near homeless Black man give me $1-2 every time on a beer. And a white dude in a business suit give me 25 cents. And I’ve had a white, hilbilly type looking dude in overalls give me $100 just because I looked tired as I was wiping down the table.

So yes, not being tipped is a frustrating experience, but you learn to approach every table with a smile and you give them the best service regardless of race, their appearance, or cause they look they don’t have any money. Sometimes folks live up to“stereotypes.”Sometimes they surprise you. But you’ll never know if you walking around with an attitude every time the“wrong”party gets seated in your section.

O rly? So now, it’s just money? Sir, I’ve watched you go back and forth with other folks in this here comments section all day. And I’m sure it must be tiring. All I’m going to say is you should separate tipping from treatment. You’re a server. Not a servant. When I was a hostess/bartender/waitress I never let anyone–red, yellow, black, or brown, disrespect me, or talk down to me, or try to make me feel less than a human being/a child of God/a person who also has their own bills to pay. Because what you ain’t fina do is run me like a slave and then not tip me. Ummm…no. You will need that water, those napkins, that Long Island Iced tea from me at some point during your meal. And so I question your demeanor with your [certain] customers and why they think they can run you? I need you to learn how to give your customers a mean side eye.

*Oh and thinking Black folks are the only people who are pushy, rude and have a sense of entitlement? Puh-lease. The stories I could tell. But that’s just it–they are just stories about particular people of a particular race at a particular time in particular place–don’t go talking about means, medians and averages…

I’ve worked in healthcare for over 10 years so the amount of subtle racism I’ve experienced makes talking about race very hard for me. While I know not all White folks are racists, I seen&amp;heard those same kum-bi-yah folks demand White person only service. So I’m not certain if I’m hypersensitive or battle fatigued.

While dining out, I keep in mind that in most European countries, servering is a career for most. Not something to do in the mean time so I tip well. If I get bad service or feel I’m being discrimating against, I tip less&amp;talk to the manager or owner.

I usual go to 4/5 star restuarants to eat because I believe if I’m going to eat out, it will be worth it. Never really had a bad server but usual get shade or ugly looks from nonBlack patrons for being in“their”restuarant. Once there was a fly in my wine&amp;after asking the server for another glass, quietly letting the server know there was a bug in it, I overheard a woman near my table say,”Those people always put things in their food…”.

Two things:
1) Im indifferent and slightly appalled when blacks are embarrassed of other blacks and so called airing dirty laundry to whites. Who are whites but people too? Plus, with their history, theyve got a lot of ground to cover in the way of embarrassment (and savagerysorry, subconscious just threw that in there).

Regarding the example of tipping, I tip and usually dine with people who do. Im not accountable for people who dont and do not like being mistreated because of it. Thats the personal problem of the waitermistreating people based on poor assumptions is wrong in every race, creed, ageif you dont think so, then yes you are savage. While Ill treat you kindly anyway, I wont ever (never, ever, eva) give folks an out for believing it. It is the human standard. You will be held to itstatistics on blacks tipping or otherwise.

2) My issue is how (when a number of a certain type of white people are involved) quickly a discussion about tipping or crime or Kobe or Obama or ground meat or whatever always devolves into lets look at all the ways black people are inherently inferior to not only us but everybody else.

Thanks for writing this observation. However, I have a hard time separating that observation from the humdrum of articles identifying how very inferior black women (kids, culture, people in general) arespecifically to white people.

Champ,
First of all, love you. Love Panama. Love that you both love Liz.. Love the blog. Loved the book. Read it in two days. Laughed my ass off. Recommeded it to my smart friends. Look forward to new posts everyday, but I’m really not feeling the whole racism dialogue for today’s post. You know, we live with the stuff er’day. It’s gonna be there regardless. I read your blog because I love a world where my world is about something more than how another race reacts to me. I understand why you shared, I’m gonna follow up on the Good Men Project, and look for you both everywhere. But please, no more of this stuff. Thank you. Love you.

I read through all the comments on GL Piggy’s post. They were both racist and sexist. Any server who consistently got bad tips all around had to be either black or an unattractive white woman. Those who tipped badly were either black or unattractive feminist white women. (Apparently, attractive feminist women don’t exist). Given GL Piggy’s own comments in his post, it is clear he subscribes to the theory that black people are inferior or defective in some way.

Yet despite their belief in such theories, they also clearly know it to be wrong. How? Because the justification for saying (well, writing) those things are weak.“We were having a discussion and tossing out possible ideas”. Really? Your possible idea for blacks consistently tipping less is that they’re incapable of anticipating consequences of future actions?

In any case, the point about bringing up GL Piggy’s own comments is to highlight that he has a specific set of views and it is not surprising that his typical readership will share them. So the comments there are not really surprising.

Here’s the funny thing about racism. Racists aren’t really self-aware of their racism–because they believe they are absolutely right. It is a very insidious problem. You cannot correct or change someone who has no doubts about what they think or refuses to accept someone else’s authority or viewpoint. At best, you can change their outward actions through laws. You can easily see just how many people don’t realize this by the number who someone think that because Jim Crow was outlawed years ago, things should be fundamentally different. As if racism was just a fad or the in-thing and once made illegal and out of style, nobody subscribes to it anymore. Clearly nobody remembers the Volstead Act (18th Amendment) and its corresponding repeal by the 21st. Funny how prohibition did nothing about people’s desire to drink.

To clear up, here is my position on black inferiority. I believe that aspects of black culture–or that set of values that black people tend to identify themselves through–is inferior to the social norm. I am on the fence on innate IQ differences. But either way, blacks as a group have a lower average IQ than whites as a group. I would expect that lower average IQ would also translate into more rudeness and a lesser tendency to tip properly.

That second sentence contradicts the first. If you are on the fence, then either of these three are viable options:

1. Blacks as a group have the same average IQ as whites as a group
2. Blacks as a group have higher average IQ than whites as a group.
3. Blacks as a group have lower average IQ than whites as a group.

If you believe only one of the three, you are no longer on the fence. If you believe any but the 1st, you meet the definition of racist.

Thanks for clearing things up–where with“clearing things up”you meant validating my conclusions.

This was a great post, Champ.

You know, I was a server for a year and half while I was in undergrad and worked at two different‘fancy’restaurants that were frequently by mostly white people. In both spots, I was basically the only black server (there were a couple others but none of them lasted). Anyways, I worked with pretty much all white folks and whenever a group of black people would come in, they would just openly talk about not wanting to wait on them (oh but when some of the Steelers came in one night, everyone was falling all over themselves to wait on them, though—so they’re not that stupid).

But I can’t fully blame them though cause I can say directly from experience that black folks generally don’t tip well, sorry to say. And because of that, I used to purposely bring up the topic of tipping around my family and black friends just to see what they say. Surprisingly (or not), a good number of them didn’t even know that you were supposed to tip at least 15%. Or they didn’t know how to calculate 15% so they just guessed. So basically they were accustomed to just leaving some arbitrary amount–not based on being cheap or an a-hole, just based on their judgement of how the service was. My cousin told me her ex (who made a sh*tload of money by the way) used to always just leave $5. No matter how good the service was. Yikes. I pity the people who have had to wait on that guy.

People dont understand that as a server you have to report your own tips for taxing purposes. The government also understands that you’ve probably received a good amount of cash tips that they have no way of verifying but since the minimum tip is 15%, you’re being taxed on the assumption that you’re receiving at least 15% from your customers. So everytime you leave less than a 15% tip, that server is going to be taxed on money they didn’t receive. If that server gave you sh*tty service then sure, so the heck what.. but if they didn’t give you bad service, just didn’t kiss your a** enough or go above and beyond, you should still always tip 15%.

@GL–

That’s because your comments do not strike me as just coming from a place of genuine honesty, they’ve been mean spirited and abrasive

I don’t think that most educated/intelligent black folks (such as those on this blog) have a problem with white folks being purely honest and candid about their experiences with or preconceived notions of black folks.. its when they don’t make the distinction that they understand‘all’black people do not fit into that group or behave that way.. and also when the comments seem to come from a place of condescension and/or disdain.

Just as all the uneducated poor as hell rednecks and methed out trailer park trash obese white folks down South/in the midwest do not represent White folks as a whole–ignorant and/or bad behaving black folks dont represent us as a whole. I’m sure every race of people has some segment of their population they’re not proud of so of course people are going to offended by your generalizations.. Funny how white folks like to pretend those‘other’white folks don’t exist….

Funny enough, just before reading this post, I commented on another racially-inspired post on another blog about the new Nivea commercial that shows a clean-cut black guy holding the head (it’s not gruesome, though) of an afro-clad, unshaved black guy with the caption“re-civilize yourself”and“look like you give a damn,”which clearly imply that afros and unshaved faces on men indicated a lower level or cilvilzation, which in turn many black viewers took as a shot at African-American men who choose not to sport the clean-cut look. My response to that post was similar to my thoughts on this one:

I think that if we in the black community would stop trying to write off inconsiderate, socially incorrect actions (like lousy tipping and overly picky/whiny attitudes towards resturant service and food) as African-American culture then maybe we wouldnt be so quick to pull the race card on everything and instead just call it what it is, regardless of race. Because the sad truth is, for the most part, yt people didn’t“make up”these stereotypes. They over-exaggerate them and take them out of context and for that, they should be called out and corrected, yes, but if we hadn’t given them a baseline or starting point in the first place, would then even have anything to over-exaggerate? Of course if there is lousy service, bad food, etc. then we are more than warranted in these actions, no argument there. But I’d be lying if I sat here and (just because I’m black) said that I don’t witness the same mess myself more frequently, and more times than not unecessarily, among“us”than any other race. Sorry.

That being said though, this:

“Also the infantile mind theory is no good, theyre not infants, they are of below average intelligence often but above retardation. No, theres no big mystery here, theyre just jerks is all.”

I don’t think the attempt here it so write off incorrect actions. The attempt is to point out the history behind it and motivate discussion about how it can change.

The point is that if I understand that poor tipping stems from a perception that my black customers will receive poor service, then I combat it by providing them good service (though why I’d even need to encourage myself to provide good service is questionable).

The point is that if I understand that poor service stems from a perception that I won’t tip at the expected societal level, then I should tip at what society would expect for the service I receive.

The point is that (if we assume that the majority of people are not racist and are at worst, merely ignorant), then much of the friction along racial lines that we experience today are actually rooted in our past history and we need to make a collective effort to move forward from them.

Yes, but what is (most times) not-so-widely acknowledged is the“we”aspect of needing to move forward and the fact that“we”includes us (the black community) as the recipients of negative preconcieved notions just as much as it includes those approaching situations based on prior assumptions, whether as a result of honest ignorance or learned racism. Both parties have a part to play and I feel that part of the black community playing our part is to stop doing things that we KNOW are socially incorrect just for the sake of not conforming because ultimately, what we are really doing is fuleing the stereotype and continuing the cycle of the very thing we say we are trying to move forward from, IMO.

So long as we continue to reside in the very land‘they’ stole commandeered, should we continue to be alarmed by these pervasive opinions and attitudes? Especially since we all know that it[racist attitude] is coming from a position of entitlement, unknown privalege, and several lifetimes of deliberate miseducation.

In this day and age, are we[people of color] still expecting empathy from the rulers of this nation? It is 2011 rapidly approaching 2021(yes, 20 21 ). Sure, with some exceptions(occasional incidents in the south and the ever growing police brutality/murder rate), the physical lynchings by mobs of your everyday 9-5′er prevalent in previous eras have seemingly ceased. However, in its place now resides what I call, psychological lynchings. Any act of discrimination, racism, race based presumption etc that results in unequal and unfair treatment of another is what I consider psychological lynching. The impact of such an act goes beyond just the isolated experience. Its psychological, and has far reaching effects on an individual and the way he/she may process situations/encounters going forward.

The world is just as misinformed about people of color, as we are about our selves. Hence the collective world’s harsh reactions, attitudes, and opinions towards the browner skinned populace. The‘heightened distrust’and‘hyper-sensitive’disposition of people of color towards the sons and daughters of slavemasters is a result of generations of mistreatment and inequity. There is a natural internalized distrustful relationship as a result of our‘less than enjoyable’time together. The historical relationship between blacks and whites (especially within this country) has not been one to write home about. At least not in the context of a glowing, enjoyable experience anyway.

My question is simple and two fold:
Given our history, and our present, is it unreasonable to comprehend why the existing psyche of black folk is extremely guarded and sensitive?
Given our history, and our present, is it unreasonable to comprehend why the existing psyche of white folk is extremely unempathetic and arrogant?

In a twisted sort of way, we are two sides of the same coin and as it stands, neither side will ever‘see’eachother. At the end of the day, they will and can never understand our plight, past or current. Unless we pull some rise of the planet of the apes sh!t and take this muthaf*cka over. &lt;—bad pun, I know. If you&apos;re offended, there&apos;s plenty slices of watermelon and a jug of red koolaid in the back to quell the anger. Help yourselves, its FREE. 

In short, the world is full of @ssh0les. Some of them do your dry cleaning. Some of them go through the motions interview you for positions of interest. Some of them are your servers while dining out. And some of them give you physicals every 6 months for your routine check up. And you know what? When they pass on in life, as we all will one day, their sons and daughters will likely pick up the torch and carry on the legacy of that same bigotry and senseless hate. And our sons and daughters will continue to be guarded, and tip‘poorly’. Such is the circle of life. *cues Lion King music*

“My issue is how (when a number of a certain type of white people are involved) quickly a discussion about tipping or crime or Kobe or Obama or ground meat or whatever always devolves into lets look at all the ways black people are inherently inferior to not only us but everybody else.

Thank you for explaining that. I guess I can’t really participate in this because I don’t participate in discussions like this. By‘like this’I mean that I don’t sit or stand around with a bunch of white folks (other otherwise) bashing any ethnicity. Now individuals, that’s another story. Even in my own extended family, when I hear shyt like this being said I politely excuse myself from that type of conversation. It is pure ignorance.

When people try to rationalize how an ethnicity is‘inferior’to another that is so not a good thing. For instance, I bet there are folks here on VSB that probably think that all Arab and/or Muslims are terrorists. Whereas in reality, I know a lot of Arabs and/or Muslims who deplore what other Arabs and/or Muslims have done to create social change or advance the Islamic beliefs. I saw a lot of comments where all white folks were grouped together by some black folks and, in essence, those black folks were doing the same thing they complain about white folks doing. It is a vicious cycle, ain’t it?

Now, that said, I do make fun of these stereotypes. For instance, I recently took a trip with my children and we had to go through airport security. My daughter asked why she didn’t get to go through their new image scanner instead of the regular metal detector. I replied,“Because they don’t know your part Arab.”She laughed and replied,“Right?!”

Oh, well, it is what it is. Moving on now.

I haven’t gone through the comments here but I did read your article a few weeks back. This part had me nodding in agreement:“If a new neighbor isnt personable, hes suspected of being racist instead of just shy. Your blackness decides your career path instead of your competence. Any non-black staunch Obama critic isnt really all that concerned with his policies, and the fact that your last name starts with Y definitely isnt the reason why your high school physics teacher places you in the back of the classroom. Positives arent immune either, as you begin to wonder if youre legitimately smart and talented or just smart and talented compared to what society expects of you.”The last sentence definitely resonates with me as I have questioned my own intelligence compared to that of my friends (some who have gone to ivy leagues or top 20 universities/colleges) and wondered if my race played any part of where I am today since I have been told countless times (as if it is some type of compliment) that I do not act or talk black (this is a post that I would love for you to write aboutif you havent already).

However, when I read this part, Today, though, the shitty customer stereotype accounts for the shitty service we generally receive just as much as (if not more than) actual racism does. If my 20 year-old server at Applebees is lax because Im black, maybe shes racist, and maybe shes just aware that theres a good chance Im not going to tip her well, and its human nature and practical for her to focus more energy on other customers I had to raise my brow because I was like where is he going with this? We ALL stereotype. It is human nature. Stereotypes are based off of some truth. Whether it be small or huge (ie. Asians and their picture taking, blocking the sidewalks and flow of traffic, on vacation ridiculousness), the stereotype is there. We should recognize it, as you did, and treat everyone the way we want to be treated as if the shoe were on the other foot. We should try to dissect the perceived wrong in order to understand what happened race should be the last consideration that we have and even if this is the realization, we should move above and beyond that even though the other person chose not to.

I felt that you bringing up a point concerning tipping detracted from your argument because the comments then went to why dont blacks tip well (which it did) instead of bringing up a discussion on a too heightened racial awareness that makes it increasingly difficult to discern between legitimate racism and race-based discrimination. I guess I would have delved into being smart and earning your place vs. being perceived smart because you go against the stereotype of what many perceive for your community to be.

It may just be me, and I saw where you were trying to go, but you lost me in your whole argument when you brought something up minor when you had so many great points at the beginning of your article that you could have expounded on.

I don’t do that.
In my experience, education does not mitigate racial attitudes much, it just changes their form. Mainly because most white people are not educated on how to act around black people and what to think about black people differently. The lessons are very similar at their core and so are the attitudes. The biggest difference is that educated white practice better impulse control and are more savvy about hiding their feelings.
This is truth. Ignore it at your own peril.

It’s truly sad to read that comment that black people are jerks and slightly above retardation. It’s obvious the comment comes from anger and this was his way of relieving that pinned up aggression.

With that said…I am a black server in Los Angeles and I go above and beyond to provide each and every one of my guests with the best service possible because I believe everyone deserves fair service. Unfortunately, I’ve had many of the same experiences that the white server spoke of. Just recently there was an NAACP conference by my work so most of the patrons were from this conference. Every one of those tables I served ran me ragged, were impatient, complained about the tiniest thing as if not liking the spinach dip was the end of the world, and completely inconsiderate of the fact that I had other tables to tend to. Throughout my frustrations I still provided stellar service and was left with 10% or less with a damn smile on there face. These weren’t“ghetto”people obviously. They were well dressed, well spoken, and professionals yet they lacked the common restaurant etiquette.
I’ve heard many African-Americans say they don’t care that tipping is how we make our living and they don’t understand why we have to tip. What I say to them is go to McDonalds if that’s the case. I don’t come to your job taking money out your paycheck and wasting your time. It’s sad because they come off as ignorant and inconsiderate. The same thing happens with my other friends and my boyfriend who are black servers as well. A friend of mine just told me of a party of 10 black people he served that left him a $3 tip on $100 check! There’s been so many times I’ve heard and seen black folks pull out the race card in a hot second for nothing. For instance a table of 3 black girls came in overtly drunk after a concert one night. The manager cut 1 of the girls off b/c it was obvious she couldn’t drink anymore and she says“Is it because I’m black?!”At that moment I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.
At this point I’m so frustrated with this topic and I just want a platform to inform people about the life of a server and how hard we work and it’s not right to just leave them your scraps after working them around the restaurant. Just like you don’t want someone to give you bad service b/c they assume you’re going to tip bad don’t come into a restaurant assuming you’re going to get bad service b/c you’re black. It’s not right to ask for an item to be removed from the bill after you’ve eaten more than half of it, it’s not right to be rude to a server the moment they walk to the table, it’s not right to pull the race card, and it’s not right to leave nothing. When you do this you make yourself look uneducated and ignorant and the white people aren’t the only ones talking shit about you.
My boyfriend and I go out to eat all the time and enjoy discovering new places and I’ve never felt I received subpar service b/c I’m black. Did you ever consider the server is lazy or not that bright b/c let me tell you a lot of the times that is the case. It is 2011 and we need to stop being so self conscious about how society views us. It’s up to you as an individual to show people that you are a good person and that you’re smart and goal oriented and a functioning member of society. My group of friends is a huge melting pot and I’ve come to learn so much about everyone, not just about there race and culture but about them as people.
PS- youtube the video“why the fuck I got to tip?”You’ll cringe…

This is an excellent comment. I think a lot of black people are under the false impression they are being given inferior service because they are black and their server is white. Since you work as a waitress you know what good service is and you said you do not receive inferior service when you go out to dinner with your boyfriend. Maybe more black people should work in the food service industry and then they would be more realistic about what constitutes good service.

Hi there,

I’m the Lisa Hickey named in the post, and I wanted to drop in and say“hi”. Damon showed me this post last night, and all I could say was Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I was blown away. As I said to The Good Men Project founder, Tom Matlack, 5 minutes later—“I can’t believe Damon wrote something so beautiful and eloquent. Because I would have just been f*cking angry.”

I agree with so many of you—“people don’t know how to talk about race”and“I prefer my racism (or sexism or ageism) straight with no chaser”and that it is absurd that“someone would take a post about bill paying and extrapolate a view on an entire groups intellect”. And that too many people believe we do in fact live in a post-racial colorblind society, when, in fact, that is so obviously not the case.

And what I hate most is that people talk about black people or white people *as if it matters.* (Im not saying it doesnt matter. I just hate that it does.) Which is why I cant apologize for my people (UGH) or white people and I cant begin to know how to solve the problem other than to keep talking about it.

So I appreciate more than anything that all of you are willing to keep talking about it. And I appreciate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, without a single string attached, Damon, who I have the greatest admiration for as a human being, who started it all and had the courage to continue the conversation.

The majority of commenters here, that is, everyone but GLPiggy, have a problem with basic abstract reasoning. Luckily, I’m here to help. You’re welcome.

Attempting to refute a stereotype–including one backed by peer-reviewed, academic research, as GLP has been trying valiantly to get you to acknowledge–by mentioning an exception to a rule constitutes an EPIC FAIL A relative generalization–those which include qualifiers like“most”or“the typical”—cannot be refuted by exceptions, only absolute statements can. If I make the absolute statement“all birds can fly”penguins and ostriches refute my rule. By contrast, if I say,“black patrons statisically tip even their black servers worse”the saintly tipping habits you attribute to yourself and your friends do not make for a counterargument, as the average or the mode or the majority or whatever is not contradicted by the existence of a minority. Furthermore, attempting to refute a generalization–academically verified or not–with one’s personal experience is disparaged as“arguing by anecdote.”If I survived taking a bath with a plugged-in radio, I haven’t argued that this is a safe bathing practice.

To summarize the paragraph above: servers (white or not) don’t think all blacks are bad tippers and patrons, they think that blacks are greatly overrepresented among such patrons, even when factors like income are taken into account, and not a single detractor of this generalization has made a partially decent case against it.

Also, one does not refute a person’s statement by pointing to that person’s personal flaws, real or not. If the worst person in the world—that must be Rush Limbaugh–says that 2 plus 2 equals 4, his math is correct even if his personality is terrible. So, even if GLP has a“chip on his shoulder”or his approachiing his black patrons“with attitude,”the quality of his statements remains a distinct category.

So, stop trying to psychically peer into GLP’s head, and instead address his arguments.

I agree with your point. Most of the users here are well aware of statistical usages. Really, if black people make up a larger percentage of problem patrons- what difference does it make? A server still should provide good customer service because he/she doesn’t want to lose customers overall and cannot predict whether a black person’s tip will be good or bad. More importantly, if they believe blacks are worse tippers, a server would essentially be guaranteeing a bad tip by being rude.

The disturbing things I read today, not on this blog but in some of the links provided above, included proposed reasons why black people were so much ruder- we’re jerks, we’re dumber, we don’t have common morals- and obviously all of these are offensive. GLP also alluded to these ideas himself although I didn’t notice him say any outright (could be wrong). We know statistics (even though we’re really working with anechdotal stuff at this point) don’t dictate how we should treat individuals as GLP and some other comments illustrate is happening.

I agree in the pointlessness of trying to refute a study with anecdotal observations. What is problematic is that there does not exist a good study from which to draw any conclusions. All the studies cited have lots of problems–either in methodology or explanation of results.

In any case, most of the problem with GLP is not in his trying to get people to agree that blacks in general tip less, but that blacks tip less because we are inferior in such a way that it causes at least two issues:

1. A predisposition to under-tipping due to us valuing the work of others much less and

2. A psychopathic apathy towards society where despite knowing societal norms on tipping, we still succumb to our baser instinct: to under-tip.

You’re missing the point. The point is that you should not judge and treat people you do not know according to a stereotype of their group because an individual can easily not fit into that stereotype, like many of the commenters here on this particular issue. If I were to walk into this guy’s restaurant intending to tip 20% and the waiters ignore me for 15 minutes or give me less than decent service because the“typical”black person doesn’t tip, I have been treated unjustly. I don’t give a damn about what other people do; as a patron, and a human being, I deserve decency and basic respect. And if I don’t get it, then the waiter shouldn’t be surprised when he is tipped less or reported to the manager. If that’s entitlement, so be it. According to yourself, you’re a paragon of intelligence and reason, so you should get this.

All these shots at our collective intelligence, by G.L. and his posse and now you, are unwarranted and unnecessarily offensive. And you know it. But you all seem determined to trivialize the issue and cling to the notion that we are inferior to you, so go right ahead. Continue to underestimate us, and we’ll continue to advance and enjoy our lives.

While I think that honest candor in a discussion is important, there is a difference between being honest and just stereotyping. Clearly this guy [thinks he] has not had great experiences with black patrons, but what I find troubling is that he’s completely over-focused on it, and fails to recognize the majority of the time when he’s had black patrons that have caused no disturbance or the multitude of times when he’s has disruptive white patrons.

The contention oft-made here that tipping below the social norm constitutes a political protest against socio-economic injustice is laughable.

A true protest entails sacrifice on the part of the protestor. The activist who gives up his day to march in the streets and his pristine lack of a criminal record from the ensuing jailtime is actually protesting. The cheapskate who tips little or not at all is not, because he’s accruing for himself the opposite: a benefit in monetary savings. What’s worse, this benefit accrues to him at the expense of the remainder of society that follows the rule, as GLP has mentioned (yet another argument that has gone unadressed and unrefuted.)

I’m not sure you actually read what GLPiggy said. It wasn’t that Black people are disproportionately among bad tippers. He tried to imply that the vast majority of Black people are bad tipper AND the reason behind this is because they are actively fighting against mainstream social norms. Champ and the VSPs here are pointing out innocent reasons that this may happen. A lot of it is because of ignorance of said norms. Also, there is a fear of poor service from White servers, which tends to degenerate into mutual distrust.

What people are trying to do is to refute what GLPiggy said and explain the reasons behind such behavior, up to and including mentioning counter-examples.

So, allow me to ask you something. What is the one thing you fear that comes from the existence of Black people in this society?

Since, unless it is blatant, nobody can read tone i’d just like to say my questions aren’t meant to be abrasive or defensive I am just asking for an answer and trying to defend myself since it seems despite any actions I may have I am going to be grouped in with people I probably don’t even know. And I also apologize if I’m making an argument that has already been made.
well first off:
“Yeah, well if youre looking that hard for something to be wrong then youll find it regardless of your servers inner thoughts.”
These are your words.
Yeah, well if you’re looking that hard for something to be wrong then you’ll find it regardless of your customers’behavior.

“So its very convenient (not to mention debilitating) to sit there and think that every little tic is an indication of the servers racism. You can hold this opinion, but you should also give equal credence to the possibility that servers are merely reacting to patterns theyve witnessed time and again.”

You also seem to talk a lot about the average.
The thing is I don’t understand how statistics about a race of people can be relevant when there is no scientific cause for it. (If someone would care to explain I would appreciate it). What I mean to say is there is no genetic cause for rudeness or no study that says an increase of melanin in the skin can cause side effects such as loudness, rudeness, and bad tipperitis. So to say that it’s a black thing doesn’t make since to me especially since correlation is not causation. It’s all social which unfortunately means it’s all in our heads. I’m not crazy all I’m saying is there is no other reason for society to be the way it is other than that’s the way it is. So unfortunately due to history beyond our control a black person has come into your restaurant with a chip on his/her shoulder due to social constructs that have been passed down in one form or another from the black white power struggle that is as american as tipping. I say all this to point out when you complain about a chip on a black persons shoulder there is nobody to blame but the white person that put it there. Is that fair, that you get looked at like the white person that put it there? Absolutely not. So please don’t look at me like the black person that stiffed you of your tip, because I am not a stereotype I am an individual.

No lie, as I was logging into my account today to check the blogs I noticed that many of the bloggers I follow present a similar viewpoint to my own…and that if I didn’t know better I would think that all people did, and there were a few odd outliers with dissenting opinions. I do know that is not the case. I know there are many people out there and“these arent your stereotypical uneducated trailer park racist rednecks”that think like the author of the Not Tipping While Black article author and his commenters. They, very often, also engage with people and follow blogs and have friends with similar viewpoints. As vast and intricate as these interwebs may be, it is quite possible that these two different groups may have never had the opportunity to interact if not for sharing that original article with a different audience. Maybe that’s a case for continuing to do so…if for nothing else other than to serve as a reality check. They are out there…even here in“post-racial America”…thinking that Black folks have trouble comprehending the bill.

I work with rich“white”folks (they are Jewish, so not your typical WASPs) and their subtle racism is so disturbing. I try my very best not to air out any of my people’s dirty laundry around white or“white”folks. I even try not to air that out around other minorities (I am Latina), but even with other minorities, I don’t mind letting my guard down a bit with them because regardless of any racial strife among minorities, we still“get each other.”Bottom line. I think it is important that we continue to protect this dirty laundry. Not to say that we should act as though it doesn’t exist at all, but there really is no need to manifest it. We can admit we’re not perfect, but no need for specifics. Once we go into specifics, we’re doomed.

The honest truth is that we are all very different. Black People Differ from White People period. The lines of culture may have been crossed time and again, but racism and inequality will always be present. I tip at 20%(for good service), I pay my bills on the due date, I make sure my 7year old son’s boxers can’t be seen outside of his pants. I dont use the word“wont”in place of want…I can go on and on about the many assumed habits of my people that I don’t possess. BUT…all of those dont stop me from recieving crazy looks from“people”in the predominantly white/asian city that I work in. It doesnt stop me from getting pulled over in a routine traffic stop to make sure my BMW was insured (to quote the cop,“or he was calling a tow truck). I work hard for my money, and while I do tip at the norm, please believe I better not get one inclination that my server is wearing thier color guard because I have no problem telling them why I wrote $0.0 on the line!

Customer service is lacking in general. As a consumer regardless of where I shop/eat if I have a problem I will voice my concern to the wait staff. Most will automatically refer you to the Manager. I state my claim to the Manager and turn down anything comp because I didn’t come to the restaurant for a free meal. I come for the experience of not having to cook or clean for the evening. I prefer a new server versus a comp meal. It helps to inform the staff what you need from the break. I hate being interrupted 20 times during my meal so I tell the staff upfront I need extra napkins yes I know the cranberry juice is not considered a refill to automatically refill and charge me for it et al.

Late I know…however while in college I worked in a restaurant as a hostess and we had a“tip-share”system. All the servers gave a percentage of thier nightly tips and it was divided up equally between the hosts and bussers. I noticed that most of the servers automatically assusmed the black patrons would be terrible customers and asked that they not be seated in thier section. IMO the service should reflect the tip, that said I dont really care that you only get paid $2.13 per hour because thats the job you CHOSE to apply for. The Department of Labor states“An employer of a tipped employee is only required to pay $2.13 an hour in direct wages if that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage, the employee retains all tips and the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. If an employee’s tips combined with the employer’s direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference.”Meaning that no matter what you will atleast be paid minimun wage regardless so trying to make people think that woe is me I only make two dollars per hour is false. Also, Im going to assume the reason you CHOSE being a server as your profession is because you can make a great deal of money. Personally I feel some type of way about the Hooters girl making more money per hour than me, when I worked hard to graduate from college with honors. Servers dont just have one table, they have several at a time and the bad tips average out with the good tips.

I just wish I could go outside and be a representative of just me, and not everyone that I just happen to share the same skin tone or gender

Two things:

1) I tip well…now. This hasn’t always been the case. I grew up on the lower end of the middle class totem poll. As such, I wasn’t given all of the proper tools of modern etiquette for a variety of things, the art of dining out among them. As I grew older, traveled abroad, worked in the food industry, and acquired my own money, I grew to learn the importance of tipping and it is not something I take lightly…mostly because I view food as one of life’s greatest pleasures and a not-so-small part of me considers it a blessing, especially in this economy in this state of affairs, to have the ends to take myself out and enjoy a hearty meal. Again, this hasn’t always been the case. So if a server is amenable, explains the specials, brings the food out as I asked, keeps my glass filled, and leaves me alone long enough to enjoy my meal, they get a *bare minimum* of 20%. If I don’t feel like throwing down that extra 5th, I call ahead and pick up. Period. But please note that this is something I’ve come to in my adulthood, *not* something that was taught to me in my youth…for what it’s worth.

Also, perhaps it is because I live in Atlanta, or because I am somewhat petite (read: non-threatening) and aloof lady who behaves as if she knows her way around a menu (I really, really love food) or maybe it’s just because I am a food snob and choose really awesome restaurants (hint: it has nothing to do with how it looks on the outside), but I have almost always gotten stellar treatment from all of my waiters/waitresses, regardless of race. They are friendly, amenable, and often more than willing to roll with the punches through an odd request or two (ie…my varied attempts to cut calories from entrees or requesting to receive the check with the meal if I am pressed to get to the next engagement).

2) In regards to the weird turn this topic took towards race relations…I am dark-skinned Black woman of West Indian descent who was born in Miami, raised in the deep South by a single parent in a Black neighborhood of scattered affluence, mentored by a British White man to be ushered into PW(Ivy) and (re)-transplanted back into the South where I have, for the past ten years, worked in a predominantly White setting that can appropriately be described as Nouveau Rural. The things this fellow Radiohead lover’s followers posted on his site are typical of some of the gems that have slipped, directly or implied, from the lips of colleagues and associates in the past few years. But here’s the rub…I’ve heard some equally horrific things spewed from the lips of people who shared the same skin color as me.

Looking back through my life, and growing ever-closer to middle age, it just seems like“race”, while definitely not a small thing, is not the over-riding theme of the World I inhabit. It is kindness and compassion and yes,“class”…but most of all, it is intellect and education, which in many ways is the great equalizer. So when I read this waiter’s rants, or really *anyone* who attempts to draw a negative connotation based on stereotypes and generalities (and YES, there have been certain personalities in the comments section of this blog I would include in this), I just view them as red herrings. I smile politely and nod at these people. But I DON’T have conversations with them. I discuss important thoughts with people who are capable of listening, who open to learning AND teaching; in essence, with people who fundamentally matter. For this is where true discourse (as opposed to verbal sparring or“self-love”) begins…and in real conversations, there is no need to worry about airing dirty laundry…in fact, the dirtier, the better.

Point # 1 is exactly the one I was trying to make earlier. I, too, also grew up at the lower end of the middle class totem poll. I didn’t grow up knowledgeable of“tipping etiquette”or any of that. I grew up seeing men treat waitresses like semi-prostitutes, spending hours at their establishments and only tipping them a few dollars. I knew this wasn’t normal, so over time, I made an effort to learn this etiquette. A lot of us minorities are still not“up there”with white folks unfortunately (financially speaking, not in terms of intelligence) and many of us don’t know the“rules of tipping”

Your last point hit home with me, except the dirty laundry part. I am very protective of it. Comes from working in an office where 9 of the 10 people I’ve recommended for a position were denied instantly based on their racial/ethnic/religious background. Since working where I work, I’ve adopted a very defensive strategy, not just with my Latino community, but with my Muslim community (I am Muslim) and other minority communities I do not belong to.“The man”thinks badly of us as it is. I’m not going to contribute to making it dirtier. But that’s me. That’s how I react to threat.

I, too, am a Radiohead lover. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

I find the whole tipping controversy pure comedy. Servers of fast-food on ceramic dishes seem pretty d@mn entitled. Tipping at second tier restaurants is a farce. I always tip 20%, but I do it out if charity and because I can, not because I’m impressed. The waiters that do the most complaining work at chains, like Bertucci’s and such, that pretend to be real restaurants. The only mistake that the picky, demanding, stingy customers are making is thinking they’re at a real restaurant.

At real restaurants I never have to ask for anything. The waiter/ waitress thinks of everything and the service is absolutely wonderful. I don’t bother asking chain“waiters”for extra anything, because I don’t pretend to expect any real service at glorified fast food restaurants. So think about that the next time we socially gracious non-demanding customers and generous tippers leave you your pity cash.

 http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Tipping-in-Jamaica_6448848 –Here is a link to a Jamaican newspaper article. Jamaica is an over 90% black country (if you include persons of mixed descent, who total around 20% of the population) who normally do consider themselves black). I think the entire tipping argument is hyped up non-sense. Waiters and waitresses do a job and they get paid for it. Americans need to sort out how service providers are paid instead of long and meandering comments on the merits or demerits of tipping. No one, regardless of melanin inflection, should tip for crappy service.

Having been familiar with GLPiggy, Roissy and the others of the Manosphere whom Obisidian referred to in another post, it would be best to avoid them and their ilk. They have serious internal issues, largely due to their increasingly marginal role in society (that is the working class white male. The bourgeoisie white male rarely cares about these issues. As F Scott Fitzgerald once opined, the rich are different from you and I.)

I was taken aback that the Champ would venture into that twisted part of the interwebs. Its not a place you want to be too often. The neurosis of that end of the spectrum is pretty off putting.

Keep up the good work Champ and VSB crew.

@Rob,

When I was a little lad I worked as a busboy in a Restaurant in Montego Bay.

The pay was abysmal but was supplemented by how much of a percentage of the tip the waiters decided to pass on to me, which was solely at their discretion, and depended on how happy they were with my service (usually 10% but I got as much as 20% some times).

Needless to say, the waiters were not paid very well either, but I vividly remember that they hustled to service the guests, and I hustled to serve the waiters.

Trust me on this, tips were very much appreciated by all the staff (including this, at the time little white bwoy).

I really do not recall hearing that Black Americans were worse tippers than White Americans but we all hustled not matter what colour they were, and it was pretty disheartening to provide good service and get a miserly tip.

I read the Observer article. I do not tip out of guilt or any ism but because, I remember that work experience.

My rule of thumb, based on that experience was to always tip 15% on good’service and 20% on excellent service.

Finally, while I have stopped reading Roissy and Obsidion myself, I certainly see no harm in exploring what they have to say from time to time.

And if you think that GL PIggy et al are twisted, you really do not want to know the places I regularly drop in on.

I have been a longtime reader (read: lurker) but I haven’t felt compelled to take a few minutes to comment, until today. My mother always told me to tip the waiter and instilled in me early that tips provide the majority of servers’income. However, I have seen her younger sister leave $1 on a $35 Applebee’s bill. But I digress.

The comments The Champ has listed on the white dude’s blog is indicative of how I think White people feel about Black people, but are too afraid to publicize in an arena where we can readily place the opinion with a face (or a place where they think we may actually read or see it). What I mean is, very rarely will you find a White person who has the courage (or maybe the stupidity) to be as frank about his racial ideologies in a conversation with a Black person than with a white person. And this is exactly why I don’t trust White people. In fact, there are very few of them who I DON”T think call us n*****s in their head every time they see one of us. This is also why I try (sometimes subconsciously) to show White people I interact with on a daily basis that although I am a Muslim with a full beard and come from a place where Meek Mill calls“The New Iraq”, I am much more than the threat of violence my presence may project. Nevertheless, it’s still unnerving to hear a White person tell me“you speak so well”as if it’s a fcuking compliment.

But back to tipping…Personally, I try to always tip 20% no matter where I am; however, if the service sucks, I leave 10%. If the service absolutely SUCKS, I might leave a quarter. This is ensure the server knows I wasn’t just some cheap @$$ n***a who don’t tip, but a patron who thought the service was terrible. In the two times in my life I’ve felt I had to do that, I also notified the manager on duty that he/she had a sh*tty server on their floor. Both times, the manager said“i will address this immediately.”I’m not sure if that was a ruse or not, but I felt better leaving a report.
