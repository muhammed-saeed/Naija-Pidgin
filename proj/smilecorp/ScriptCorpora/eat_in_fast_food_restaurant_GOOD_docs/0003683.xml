 Library Assignment 4 
 When presented with our question there was no doubt about the first thing we were going to do–open Google. Google works for a lot of things and answering questions in the matter of time we had, is one of them. Although google is not perfect the search of our question became harder than we thought. Google presented us with several problems. If we did nothing to the question“Why do so many people get too much plastic surgery these days?”and typed it in on Google we had some problems. Not rephrasing the question presented two things. Not enough information on the subjects because we were too specific and also Google not putting all the subjects together with out“and”,“or”, and“not.”Rephrasing the sentence also gave us two problems. It gave an answer to part of the question but it also left out another part of the question. For example if we just typed in plastic surgery we would get tons of links advertising it instead of answer the question. Or if we typed too much plastic surgery we would get links on what is considered too much plastic surgery but get no reliable answer. This was one of the strategies that could be either useful or not. Using this tip would all depend on the question. Using and, or, and not was another tip we used to refine our search or in some cases boarded our search, it also united our three topics together. Our three topics being; plastic surgery, too much plastic surgery, and why people are do it. Posted by Kimi at 6:56 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook

 Google Research (July 13, 2010) 
 Today, we were given the research topic of whether or not academic dishonesty prevalent in the past 50 years. At first, we were given the opportunity to research the topic on Google ourselves, without the help any research methods or tools. As my partner and I approached this assignment, we decided to find the most important terms in our assignment, which we thought was“academic dishonesty.”However, when we typed in those words into the search box, we got 372,000 results about what it is rather than its prevalence over the past 50 years.

After listening to the lecture about different ways to research on Google, my partner and I decided to limit our search by using the“Big Bite”strategy. Instead of typing in“academic dishonesty~prevalence over the past 50 years,”we would type in“academic dishonesty~statistics”instead. After typing that into the search bar, we received 57,400 results which reduced our previous search results by about six times. After clicking through the first few websites, we found that one of the websites (the fourth one) answered our question, stating that academic dishonesty has risen greatly over the past 50 years.

Through using the“Big Bite”strategy, I thought that this definitely helped with my research skills because it helped me find a balance between being too specific or too broad when typing in a topic into the search bar. Also, through participating in this lecture I learned how to limit my search results and take time off of my researching. Posted by T.Kim at 8:19 AM No comments: Email This BlogThis!

 Why do we need books??? 
 Walk into a library today and what you see is the increasing number of computer usage and the decreasing number of books. No longer do you see people sitting down with a book on their laps reading, rather, it is laptops on tables and the sound of keyboards. The vast improvement of technology and technology devices has made libraries computer-based and librarians useless. We no longer need librarians to help us find books. The internet provides over a thousand search engines and library catalogs to search from. No longer are books needed. One can go to the internet and search for books and read them online, better yet, there is spark notes where one can get summaries of books without reading the book! The all-rounded I pads, I Phones, and e-books have made books seem mediocre. What is it about the internet that makes it more worthy of the space once occupied by books? Is it the accessibility? Or assurance that one will never have to wait a week or two just for a book? All of these and more are some of the reasons people prefer Internets to books. Books require you to sit down endless hours reading, trying to find the main point the author is trying to make. Whereas the internet gets you the information you want to know in less than thirty minutes. So why do we need books? We need books because the internet is making us lazy people who depend on it to do everything for us while we sit back and relax. We need books because they were there before the internet was. The internet is much generalized while a book is specific. If you Google a search term, the internet brings up everything that has that word in it, which takes time to browse over all the findings, in retro-spect, you can go to the library, ask the librarian to help you find a certain book, and within minutes you have a book in your hands ready to be read. For these reasons and more, I urge librarians to keep books, just because technology is rising to its peak; does not mean that books should be thrown away.
