 How to Order a Meal at the McDonald&apos;s Drive Thru

 Pin It Article Edit Discuss History Yum, McDonald&apos;s! 
McDonald&apos;s meals sure are good. But if you don&apos;t know how to order at the drive-thru, how will you get one? Many families don&apos;t have time to go inside to order, so drive thru&apos;s are essential. 
 
 Edit Steps 
 
 1 Look for what you want. Look for what you want . While you wait in line or when you can see the big board with all the food choices on it, look for what you want. McDonald&apos;s has food from salads to cheeseburgers, so pre-preparation is a must. If you have passengers eating with you, ask them what they want and make a mental note of it. 2 Check the list of food you ordered. Check the list of food you ordered . While you&apos;re ordering, there will be an electronic sign with what you want on it and what your bill is. After you&apos;re done ordering, check it to make sure the staff isn&apos;t missing anything or that they haven&apos;t put too many food items on. If they are missing something, tell them what they forgot or what they gave you too many of. For example, if you ordered two salads but only got one, say, &quot;Excuse me, but I actually ordered two salads.&quot; You must do it at the electronic billboard, otherwise you may not get your second salad. 3 Get your money ready. Get your money ready . After you move your car and are moving towards the first window, get your money ready. It not only makes the line faster, but it&apos;s easier for the staff and you. 4 Check your food. Check your food . When they give you your food, check to make sure they put in everything you ordered. Just because it was on the electronic board doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s in your bag. If they didn&apos;t give you everything, just say, &quot;Oops, you forgot one of my salads&quot;. Then they will check, and give it to you. 




 
 
 Edit Tips 
 
 *Be polite . It makes everyone&apos;s day easier and happier. Make a note. If you always take the same passenger(s) to McDonald&apos;s, notice what they usually order in case you&apos;re in a rush, they fall asleep, or they&apos;re not there. Go before or after a mealtime. Usually, during mealtimes like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, McDonald&apos;s will be especially busy. If you go sooner or later, you can beat the line. Don&apos;t worry about the condiments or anything if you want the process to go quickly. It could take awhile it you order a hamburger with no pickles, no onions, no ketchup, no mustard, but a bit of honey mustard. It takes forever and you could just take it off at home. Only request it be taken off if you or a passenger is allergic. 




 
 
 Edit Warnings 
 
 *McDonald&apos;s food may cause health problems if eaten excessively. *Do not go through the drive thru on foot. This is dangerous. Instead walk inside to order. *Don&apos;t get mad if you aren&apos;t able to get what you want. (For example, you want breakfast, but it&apos;s one minute after the time they stop serving breakfast and you don&apos;t get it, or you want Chicken McNuggets, but it&apos;s breakfast time and you don&apos;t get them. Don&apos;t try to destroy the place, punch the cashier, or start swearing at them. Chances are, it could probably get you arrested.) Because after all, Chicken McNuggets aren&apos;t for breakfast! Don&apos;t end up not getting what you want. Because chances are if you want something to eat, You gotta be polite and on time. And there is no reason to attack anybody, Cause if McDonalds tells you they don&apos;t serve chicken mcnuggets or burgers for breakfast. No need to attack then.
