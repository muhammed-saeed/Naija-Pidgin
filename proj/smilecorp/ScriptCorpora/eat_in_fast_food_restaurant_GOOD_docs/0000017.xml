 Mcdonalds 

 Advantages: No strict dress code, cheap food, always open.
 Disadvantages: Not the healthiest or cleanest places to eat.


...are doing their bit for the environment. 

***** A CAREER IN MACS *****

If you wish to apply for a role in one of the diners, then either apply online or ask the branch manager for an application form. 


*** TO CONCLUDE *****


McDonald&apos;s have come a long way since they first began in the 1970&apos;s, as they are now totally upfront about ingredients inside their food. There has been a lot said about the lack of company ethics but of course they have denied all allegations. 
All sorts of leaflets are on display and available to the customer, listing the nutritional values for each item. I am still not totally convinced my children or I are eating a healthy meal from this establishment but they have improved. 
If you want something quick or just to keep the little ones happy, then this must be your last resort. Free refills...

 Mad for Malmaison Manchester 

 Advantages: Comfortable rooms, reasonable room rates, central location
 Disadvantages: Bar prices are expensive, slow service in bar area, no car parking at hotel


...In a previous life Mr Lools and I would have a city break around once a month. A night away somewhere in the UK in a hotel for a nice meal and a break was a great way to relax. However since becoming parents weekend breaks are few and far between and dictated by babysitter availability and also cost. Sadly we don?t have the cash for extravagant luxuries like this. However we do get the opportunity every now and then to have some ?us? time and after seeing a fantastic deal for a night in the Malmaison Manchester we decided to treat ourselves. 


***The Hotel***
The Malmaison Manchester is a 167 room hotel in central Manchester owned by the Malmaison chain. The hotel website describes the Malmaison to be ?somewhere between the mists of Paris and the 24 hour party city? with a Moulin Rouge feel. Like most hotels in the Malmaison...

Review of Malmaison Manchester , Manchester 
 
 Manchester Pride 

 Advantages: Good atmosphere
 Disadvantages: Can work out quite expensive


...It makes me feel old to think that the first Manchester Pride was back in 1990. I remember that I was in Manchester that weekend and I lined the streets like thousands of others, more than a little curious as all the Parade March went by. Twenty years later and this event has gone from strength to strength, with some estimates claiming crowds in excess of 300,000 for the 2010 event that marked its 20th anniversary.

Manchester Pride takes place over the August Bank Holiday weekend and describes itself as a celebration of gay, bisexual and transgender life. It is probably fair to say that many saw its original purpose as a way to express their sexuality but these days it is much more about fund raising and there is a real carnival atmosphere. 

In August 2010 a group of about 20 of us all acquired tickets for this years event. A friend...
