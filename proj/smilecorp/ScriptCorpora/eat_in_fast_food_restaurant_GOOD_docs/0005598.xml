Lucky Wishbone founder, a fast-food pioneer, dies
 Print Email 2011-10-20T00:00:00Z Lucky Wishbone founder, a fast-food pioneer, dies Kimberly Matas Arizona Daily Star Arizona Daily Star October 20, 2011 12:00 am  •  Kimberly Matas Arizona Daily Star Comments 
Derald Fulton&apos;s recipe for success was simple: Figure out what
Tucsonans want and give it to them.

It was a business plan that served him well for more than 50
years. Fulton was the founder of the Lucky Wishbone restaurants,
where diners are hard-pressed to find anything on the menu that
isn&apos;t deep fried. And that&apos;s how generations of loyal customers
like it.

Lucky Wishbone continued to serve up the same tasty, inexpensive
fare after Fulton retired a dozen years ago. He and his wife of 70
years, Daisy, moved to Phoenix six years ago, and that is where
Fulton died Oct. 5, a month shy of his 97th birthday.

Fulton and his wife moved to Arizona in 1947. After years of
coaching high school basketball and teaching history in the
Midwest, Fulton, a Southern Illinois University graduate, wanted a
new challenge, said his son Gary. Fulton went into business with a
friend in Phoenix and opened the Polar Bar, a restaurant popular
with teens, where food was served by carhops.

After a few years, the Fultons moved to Tucson and in July 1953,
opened the first Lucky Wishbone on South Sixth Avenue. Despite the
sweltering summer temperature, hundreds of people waited in line to
pick up boxes of fried chicken at what the company&apos;s website says
was Tucson&apos;s first fast-food restaurant.

Realizing he had a hit on his plate, Fulton quickly opened more
Lucky Wishbones with the help of three men who would become his
managing partners: Clyde &quot;Buzz&quot; Buzzard, John Kinder and Donald
Morris. Buzzard is the last surviving partner.

&quot;He really experimented,&quot; Gary Fulton said of his father. &quot;He
wanted something different. He wanted something that wasn&apos;t much
trouble, that was simple, that there wasn&apos;t a bunch of
seating.&quot;

The answer: takeout food. Stand in line, place an order, walk
out with a meal in a box.

&quot;That was totally unique back then. Everybody either cooked or
ate at a restaurant,&quot; Gary Fulton said. &quot;It just exploded. They
used to open up a new place and maybe 500 people would be in
line.&quot;

Today, there are seven locations in Tucson, and a Sierra Vista
restaurant is expected to open at the end of the year.

The son of Illinois grangers, Fulton &quot;had that Midwest farmer&apos;s
mentality. He was very, very honest; a lot of integrity. Worked
hard. Treated people right,&quot; his son said.

Fulton is survived by his wife, two sons, Gary and Scott, five
grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and a stepbrother, John. He
was predeceased by his daughter, Jane Block. At Fulton&apos;s request,
there is no public memorial service.
