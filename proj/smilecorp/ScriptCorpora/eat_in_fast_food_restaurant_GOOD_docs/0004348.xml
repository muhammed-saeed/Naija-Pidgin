I was just at Chipotle for lunch and they had a tip jar in front of the register.

They hand me my food - I have to pour my own drink, get my own napkin and utensils, find a place to sit and hope it&apos;s clean, and then I&apos;m expected to throw my trash away.

Explain to me why I should &quot;tip&quot; these folks.

Thank you.

I know - I cheated on Burrito Beach - but I&apos;m at home this afternoon waiting for a delivery and Chipotle is just down the street and I was starving - and Dane has me convinced that they use organic meat in their products.  I&apos;ll be back to Burrito Beach next week :)

But still - I&apos;m fed up with these tip jars at places that don&apos;t do shit to deserve them.

What&apos;s next?  Do I tip the cashiers at Walgreen&apos;s for taking my money?

I don&apos;t get it either. Starbucks has them too. I remember about two months ago an angry near QMH&apos;er started a tipping thread about all the people you should tip, and included this kind of thing. I think *maybe* two people were in agreement with it, but overall, it&apos;s pretty stupid to tip someone for doing their job. I feel that in that situation, nobody is going out of their way for you. If you have some weird special request or something, then by all means tip for any inconvenience they may have had because of the request. If not, don&apos;t bother. Tipping should be reserved for someone who does extra work for you. Like with Starbucks: They make you coffee and that&apos;s probably it. If you have some long calculated drink you order that&apos;s a pain in the arse for them to make, tipping is appropriate. But if I go in to order say a frappuccino, where they even have a pre-made mix, I see no reason to leave them a tip.

 5/22/2009 sam k. says:
I feel really uncomfortable when tippers are in the bathroom.  Especially when they&apos;re holding the paper towels for you.  If I&apos;m at a restaurant and run to the bathroom I usually don&apos;t have cash on me.  They usually act like I owe them $$$.

Tip jars don&apos;t really bother me.  I don&apos;t tip at places like Chipotle but I tend to leave change or a buck for people who prepare food/coffee/smoothies for me.

Pouring good coffee is a skilled trade and deserves a tip just as much as a bartender does.  Now, most people who work at Dunkin D in this city fail at their job miserably, but in those instances when someone knows what you are doing they deserve a bit of cash for it.

Don&apos;t know about the burrito wrappers, don&apos;t eat there but they don&apos;t seem any different then any other fast food employee.

I&apos;m kind of afraid of the Dunkin Donuts employees by my house. I wouldn&apos;t tip them at all. One day I was in there and they accused a guy of stealing from their tip jar. They wanted me to stay and back them up. I said that I saw nothing, got my stuff, and left in a hurry. Tip jars at retail food establishments is tacky.

 5/22/2009 Double&quot;R&quot;L. says:
When you tip at Starbucks you tip everyone that works there, not the people you like. They share all the money. I suspect that is what they do at most places.

Tipping people in service isn&apos;t tacky. Obviously, if they are dragging ass and just going through motions they don&apos;t deserve any extra compensation but there are many instances were that isn&apos;t the case and not dropping your change or a $1 in the jar is tacky in those instances.

 5/22/2009 Ed &quot;It was so good... it was retarded.&quot; A. says:
I think it&apos;s an attempt by the fast food chain to improve business and the way patrons view its employees. By providing a tip jar, the fast food chain is trying to develop a relationship between employee and patron. This may foster empathy for the employees but possibly loyalty as well to the food chain. One may visit the food chain knowing the employees benefit from tips and the food chain benefits from repeat business.

Actually, it&apos;s brilliant and sinister as well. But I could be wrong.

If the people preparing my food, making my coffee, drink at a bar or facilitating me getting what I ordered without mistakes or having to wait a life time for it don&apos;t deserve a little bit of extra compensation I don&apos;t know who does.

Those jobs are easy but they are also easy to do a very terrible job at. When I see someone actually giving a shit about their job and make sure I&apos;m happy and I get what I want I think that deserves some monetary recognition.

So ignore it and move on. If the person behind the counter does something special for you and goes out of their way to accommodate you, leave a tip if you are feeling generous. That&apos;s what the jar is for. If not, don&apos;t worry about it- they are doing their jobs either way.

I worked at a place that sold cookies, drinks, and not much else. I was the only employee at a time, and had a tip jar. I never expected tips, but it was nice to get a few here and there, especially if I was going the extra mile for someone. Even if I did go out of my way, they didn&apos;t need to feel obligated to tip since it&apos;s my job, after all. At the end of the night, it was nice having at least enough money to cover my bus fare home (a whole $1.25).

The only thing that really pissed me off was when I was busy w/ my back turned, someone stole all my tips. I hope they were just hungry and needed a sandwich, but it still stunk.

I don&apos;t see how a tip jar promotes this. You could be a total asshat to deal with an still leave a tip. Does a tip excuse bad behavior on the part of the customer? IMO no. Like Amy said the tip jar is there because someone at the establishment thinks the employees deserve tips.

 5/22/2009 Double&quot;R&quot;L. says:
Ah, I never said people at Chipotle should get a tip. In fact, I said they shouldn&apos;t. Again, aside from the music and possible smell what is the difference between the person who makes you a vodka soda at night and the person who makes you a medium coffee milk&amp;sugar in the morning? Do you not tip bartenders too?

No expects anything, except possibly bartenders try not tipping them and see how quickly they come back to you when you want another round, but as I appreciate the extra efforts they make to get me what I ordered in a quick and timely manner I&apos;m sure they appreciate a bit of change or a $1 or $2 every now and again.

If you have worked in service before you realize that although the actual job itself isn&apos;t too hard, dealing with people is and for every nice person there are generally two a$$holes. You also probably see as a consumer that the person on the other side of the counter has the ability to make your brief interaction amazing and exceed your expectations or make you wonder how someone that incapable of even makes it safely across the street every day.

For the record, my first job was at Dunkin D over 15 years ago, we had a tip jar and I used to make $15 to $20 extra every shift, significantly more then my co-workers, simply by providing excellent service, knowing my customers by name and having their shit ready by the time they walked from their car to the counter.

Good Customer service is a skilled trade and when I see someone who knows what they are doing I think they deserve a bit more then what they are getting in a check every few weeks.

Yes, I tip bartenders because I know some of them get a small hourly wage and rely on tips for the rest.

But the recurring theme I see in your posts, Double R, is that we are not supposed to rely on our own experiences to form an opinion.  Instead, we are expected to rely on your experiences to form them.

Not the case all all, however, this is an opinion based website and this is a discussion board, right?  So I think it is fair to say it is o.k. to say my piece and explain why I tip people and under what circumstances.

So people who work at Dunkin D don&apos;t make a low, hourly wage? Bartenders don&apos;t take that job knowing they are getting a low wage?  What is the difference between the drink that they make at Starfucks or Dunkin D or where ever and the drink a bartender makes?  Just trying to point out the inconsistency of your rational.

I was also commenting on someone else thinking this was a new fade, tip jars have been around for a very long time. Maybe the fact that people are tightening up their wallets is why people are more sensitive about it. Or the fact that many people are going through much larger spells of unemployment then they have ever experienced and just want someone to vent on.

I&apos;ve only ever mentioned one person&apos;s grammar and that was Dan here about a week or two ago.  I don&apos;t always have time to proofread.

The folks at Dunkin Donuts make at least minimum wage.  Servers and bartenders usually make much less than minimum wage knowing the will also be compensated with tips.  (In my experience, servers and bartenders made about 1/3 of minimum wage plus tips.)

I&apos;m done trying to explain this.  I think this is my third time now...
 5/22/2009 Dan Z. says:
I love some of the rationale in this thread.

They deserve tips because the service industry jobs are a pain in the ass?

Um....so is my job on lots of days......so is most people&apos;s jobs most days.

Some trained Starbucks monkey should get a tip because they put skim milk instead of soy in your latte and a hint of caramel?

People in my office make coffee for everyone in the office without even being asked - and you know what - there&apos;s not even a tip jar on their desk.

Gimme a break.

Bartenders and servers go into their position knowing that they make less than minimum wage because they are compensated with tips, but they still have to work for those tips.  Chipotle, Dunkin D, Starbucks employees go into those positions knowing they are making minimum wage with no tips.  That&apos;s the difference.

I never said anyone deserves anything. Alls I&apos;m saying is, and I&apos;m sure everyone has experienced this, there are some people who work in these service jobs who go beyond what is required and in those instances I personally think they deserve a little extra.

They did a little extra, they get a little extra.

The gratification is instant, no need to write a letter or find a manager. To me it is like paying an insurance premium to ensure the next time I come in I have a similar experience.  Maybe that doesn&apos;t happen but who fucking cares, those people work a shit job and it is only a $1 that I will probably waste on something else so no big deal.

Dan, I hope you get paid more then the Starfucks people to do your shit job.  I know I do and that makes it a lot easier to get up in the morning and come here.

Why does my salary have anything to do with how much a Starbuck&apos;s monkey makes?

I&apos;ve worked fast food - I&apos;ve bartended - I&apos;ve waited tables - I&apos;ve had manual labor jobs - I&apos;ve had LOTS of jobs.

&quot;Going beyond&quot; what is asked shouldn&apos;t be a requirement for a tip.

The way I was raised was that &quot;going beyond&quot; showed you appreciated having a fucking job and that you were committed to your company.

If people &quot;just did their job,&quot; we&apos;d never move forward and we&apos;d only need robots.

No-one puts a gun to your head to work at Chipotle....go find another damn job if you think you&apos;re worth it.

Maybe I&apos;m missing the point here, but a tip is EXTRA, on top of what you already paid.  I&apos;m not tipping because I feel like that person should be making more money, I&apos;m tipping because they did a good job.

Now I think the debate here is what type of job deserves a tip.  I don&apos;t tip the mail man, the garbage man, or the coffee server.  I will tip the food server in a full serve restaurant.  I think that job requires lots of coordination and those people really have to haul ass.  I don&apos;t see a person standing behind a counter doing the same thing.

It doesn&apos;t.  I&apos;m just saying the more you make the easier it is to put up with a shitty job.  They (service workers) don&apos;t make much either way you look at it and it isn&apos;t really a burden to drop a bit of cash in there from time to time for people who make my experience better.

I agree, going beyond should be a requirement, but the sad fact is a lot of people in those sorts of jobs do a shit job.  And not only that a lot of people that do excellent jobs don&apos;t see the recognition they deserve from their company because they are viewed as &quot;warm bodies&quot;.

After being &quot;a trained Starbucks monkey&quot;  for a while to make ends meet, I just wanted to explain my feelings on the tip jars.  Never once, did I expect a tip.  I valued my job, because it helped pay the bills.  Yeah, the tips were nice, but  you did not keep them.  They were deposited at the end of the day, and you recieved a certain amount of it on your paycheck.  Let&apos;s just say it didn&apos;t amount to much.  And no, the job was not hard, but like any other job, the asshole ratio was really high.  Personal opinion:  If you don&apos;t want to tip, don&apos;t.  As with many things in life, just ignore it.

Here&apos;s a take on tipping.....http://www.­youtube.com/watch?v=zBFUDbOldM­s
 5/22/2009 Dan Z. says:
I&apos;ve worked minimum wage jobs as a cashier and as a stock room person.  I don&apos;t know how a person making minimum wage making coffee should be entitled to a tip vs. someone in the stock room at a retailer.

Sorry - if you put a tip jar out in front of the cashier, it&apos;s a way of communicating to your customers that you expect additional money - especially the ones that have those stupid ass sayings on it like &quot;College Fund,&quot; &quot;Baby Fund,&quot; &quot;We Work Hard for You, Show Your Appreciation.&quot;

I got your appreciation right here.

There are lots of &quot;shit&quot; jobs that pay minimum wage or close - why it&apos;s appropriate to put out a tip jar at a Starbucks, but not ask people to tip out the stock person at a Wal-Mart is beyond me - especially when you&apos;re both making the same amount of money.

And by the way - &quot;we&quot; keep calling them &quot;shit&quot; jobs.  I know several people who enjoy their &quot;shit&quot; jobs and have no desire to move onto anything else in life.  Don&apos;t assume it&apos;s a &quot;shit&quot; job unless you can read the person&apos;s mind behind the counter.

You inevitably have to share tips with people who don&apos;t deserve any, and then, you&apos;re not only working for the place in question, but also for the underproducing employees.

But seriously, I see no reason to.

But you know who should have a tip jar?  Hardware stores.  Some of those guys are so ridiculously competent and helpful.  I buy maybe 60 cents worth of bolts and a guy will spend ten minutes walking me through a project.

I think that the issue is not necessarily what we want to make it.  Seeing it there makes us feel like we are supposed to tip, and we feel cheap if we put the change back in our pocket instead of in the cup or jar.  The thing is, if you work a counter, even if you think that you dont deserve any extra, you will probably put one out if its allowed.  People may tip, they may not, but you dont lose $ by putting it out and having no one contribute, but you do lose by not putting it out when they would tip.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I almost never tip counter service, but if they want to put it out for me to ignore it, the experience is the exact same for me.

 5/22/2009 Dena S. says:
A tip jar is inappropriate where people being tipped make regular minimum wage.  Servers at restaurants make less than minimum wage (there&apos;s a special minimum wage for them), so they need tips to supplement their incomes.  Starbucks baristas make regular minimum wage, so no tips for them.

I&apos;m just going to put this out there.... waiting tables actually takes some skill.  Emotion work, time management, food and wine knowledge, and general &quot;keeping up appearances&quot; are all actually difficult when pressed for time.  Having a tip jar at the burrito counter is an insult to waiters everywhere.  If they want tips they should go work as a waiter and earn them instead of standing on a burrito assembly line.

And when they write things on the tip jar it just inches even closer to pan-handling.  Have they noticed that waiters don&apos;t directly ask for tips or try to move you into giving them by telling you what they&apos;d spend them on if you did (&quot;college fund&quot;)?

&quot;Where will it end, tip jars in cubicles?&quot;

To explain why you might tip at Chipotle....

if you get free food, you should tip.  period.  chipotle has more promotions and gives out more free food than any other &quot;fast food&quot; establishment i know of...

...or we had an event at Lunchrolls last week, or the week prior..  they have a tip jar too. did nobody else tip there for their free food?

btw, burrito beach has the same tip jar.  how did you miss pointing out that?

a place like chipotle does not at all expect most patrons to tip, however.  but if you talk your burrito girl into giving you more sour cream, i&apos;m sure there&apos;s a lot of business men who the sour cream is much more important to than the $1 tip they gave.

Yeah I agree - you shouldn&apos;t tip these people.  Can you?  Sure, go ahead and tip anyone you want to.  You can probably make a case for tipping anyone at all that provides a service to you.  And it&apos;s clear that&apos;s true based on the feedback this thread is getting.  I think the concept of having a tip jar in any over-the-counter shop is wrong.  Too many people feel they should be rewarded through tips by doing their job properly.  Just cause you don&apos;t suck at your job doesn&apos;t mean you should be tipped for it.  I ignore those tip jars and don&apos;t feel guilty for not tipping.

------------------------------­------------------------------­----------------------

I don&apos;t understand this logic.......what&apos;s the difference between me paying for free guac and chips and me getting it for free?

Nobody is &quot;waiting&quot; on you in one of these restaurants - and if I have to pour my own drink and am expected to clean up after myself, if anything, the damn food should be cheaper.  That&apos;s one less employee making drinks and cleaning off tables.

If I&apos;m at a sit-down restaurant and have a coupon with someone actually waiting on me, then sure, I&apos;ll tip on the free food.

But tip on a free drink or chips with my burrito at a QSR?  No.

BTW, I&apos;ve never seen a tip jar at the two BB locations I go to.  If I see them though - I&apos;ll still hate them.  This wasn&apos;t a bash on Chipotle - it was a bash on the stupid tip jars :)

i was referring more ot getting a whole meal free ... a free burrito, or even free burrito/drink/chips.  a $1 or $2 tip isn&apos;t going to kill you in that situation and it&apos;s a bit cheap to not offer something.

I&apos;m surprised this thread is still going.

Here&apos;s a very simple rule everyone can live by: If you feel like tipping, then tip. If you don&apos;t, then don&apos;t.

Don&apos;t feel like the presence of a tip jar means you are obligated to tip. Does the presence of a panhandler&apos;s cup mean you are obligated to give him money? I would hope not. If so, let me know where you work and I&apos;ll be sure to be outside each time you come and go.

Also, yes I tipped at Lunch Rolls for my free lunch.
 5/26/2009 Dan Z. says:
The reason why I have a &quot;problem&quot; with them is because I know people who freely admit they treat regular customers who tip better than other customers...it&apos;s pretty much self-defeating if you ask me.  I should get less attention because I come in occasionally vs. someone who comes in more frequently?  You should treat every polite customer the same at a QSR.

Dane

If the &quot;free food&quot; is what enticed me to go there in the first place, then no, I&apos;m not tipping.  I wouldn&apos;t have gone there had the free food not been a factor - that&apos;s the whole point of a promotion like that - to get someone in the door who may not otherwise come in.
