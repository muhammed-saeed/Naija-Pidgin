Chik-fil-a: How do they do it?
 When I go into a fast food restaurant I expect there to be a language barrier. I expect it to be dirty. I expect to be treated like I&apos;m an asshole. I expect to food to be low quality. So when I go to Chik-Fil-A and the place is clean, the staff is well groomed and friendly and there is no language barrier. Then the food is decent quality..... and I&apos;m in Aurora! how do they do it? Do they pay a lot more? Why can&apos;t (won&apos;t) the other fast food places do this? -2005 Rubicon February 23rd, 2010,  08:41 PM #2 LuckyNickelTJ

All so true, a cracker up front stealing all the thunder. Some of the employees are a bit too cheerful, and that scares me because I am a pretty happy guy. The STaK is worth every dollar.

 Join Date Aug 2001 Location Centennial Member # 21 Images 18 I was in their drive-thru yesterday thinking the same thing. There were 7 or 8 people up front, all white, all&gt;40. Very weird for a fast food joint. Never gotten an order wrong from them either and the food and service is typically top notch.

I must say though the MILF population at the one at University and HR Pkwy is nothing compared to the one on County Line by Park Meadows. www.staythetrail.org February 23rd, 2010,  09:23 PM #15 Big Dave

But I agree. Some of them are way too happy to be making minimum wage. If you don&apos;t vote, you can&apos;t complain. February 23rd, 2010,  10:26 PM #21 TheCopperCowboy

 Did it for the LULz Join Date Sep 2005 Location TOGTFO Member # 7443 Because they dont hire crap...pretty easy to understand. 

All the McDonalds, Jack in the Box&apos;s, Wendys, Taco Bell, etc pretty much everywhere seem to scrape the bottom of the barrel for people they hire...barely speak English, looks like they havent bathed in a month, incredibly rude...

But look at the places that actually put their interviewed person(s) to the test and make the requirements for the job more than just having a pulse(In&amp;Out and Chik-fil-a is prime example of this)...they are cleaner, the foods WAY better, the service is faster and they smile and say have a nice day in English when your done.

You can tell the places that discriminate... And thats totally fine by me as long as the service gets better. Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing their idiot

 Hooray winter! Join Date Aug 2001 Location Lakewood, CO Member # 152 Images 3 The Closed Sunday story is at http://www.chickfila.com/?#pressroom (Fact Sheets | Closed on Sunday Policy). Dumb site is in flash, so you can&apos;t copy the text out.

For anyone in Lakewood, I was asking the owner of the one at Kipling and C-470 when we would get one. She said in the next year or so the Black Eyed Pea at 1st and Wads will be closing, and they hope to take over that space. That&apos;ll be awesome, just a few blocks from my house. Chester Bullock

What I don&apos;t want is the government telling companies that they HAVE to be closed on Sundays for religious reasons. 2006 WK 5.7 Hemi February 24th, 2010,  08:40 AM #30 ZappBranigan

 Join Date May 2007 Location Englewood, CO Member # 12363 The Chick-fil-a&apos;s in North Carolina also used to give free food to LEOs.

I worked for a security company in Charlotte that also had a private police force (they have those in some states, they&apos;re called&quot;company police&quot;and they are sworn LEOs with powers of arrest but only on client property.) When I would roll through the drive-through in my Crown Vic they would usually just &apos;comp&apos; my meal. 

That may or may not be permitted by ethics rules in CO but in NC it was pretty common. Martin (AKA Zapp Branigan) KillBot (Retired)

 Join Date Aug 2007 Location Castle Rock CO Member # 13097 &quot;Why is it that those that have Chick-fil-A jobs are always smiling?

Is it the clean friendly working conditions?

Is it the above average pay for a fast food chain?

Is it because they never have to work on a Sunday?

It could be the benefits they offer or the scholarship programs that are available.

Anyway you cut it, whenever I go to a Chick-fil-A restaurant, I know that I am going to get a good food product, great service and always a thank you for my business. The bright and airy dining area is always clean and it appears that those employed by Chick-fil-A are powered by a Red Bull type happiness drink.

If one is so inclined they can go to one of the other fast food chains but there is no guarantee of being treated by like a friend as opposed to a customer like you experience at the fast food restaurant famous for its&apos; chicken sandwiches.

Chick-fil-A employees are trained to treat the customer like royalty, make the best possible food available in a timely manner and do everything they can think to make you want to go back again.

It&apos;s part of the branding that Kathy Truitt wanted when she opened up her first restaurant in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. Excellence, good working conditions, above average pay and sweet benefits are what draws employees to want to get on of those Chick-fil-A jobs and that is what makes puts the smile on the face of a Chick-fil-A employee.&quot; February 24th, 2010,  10:46 AM #39 longboy
