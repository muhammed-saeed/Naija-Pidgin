 Vientianne, Laos (Vieng Chan) 
 Posted on December 24, 2008 by admin 
 
 

 Vientiane ( Vieng Chan ) is the capital of Laos.

Understand

Compared to the hectic, bustling capitals in other Southeast Asia countries, Vientiane’s deliciously relaxing atmosphere makes it feel like the small town it is. After you’ve done the round of temples, the best thing to do here is wander down to one of the riverside beer gardens, kick back with a cold Beerlao–the Lao national beer–and watch the sun set over the Mekong.

 

History

Settled since at least 1000 AD, Vientiane became the capital of the kingdom of Lan Xang (“million elephants”) in 1545. Ransacked in 1828 by the Siamese, Vientiane sprung back in time to be again named the capital of the protectorate of Laos by the French, a position it kept after independence (1953) and after the communists took over in 1975. Today Vientiane is the largest city in Laos, with an estimated population of 200,000 in the city itself and some 700,000 in Vientiane Prefecture.

Orientation

Vientiane is stretched out on the north-eastern bank of a bend in the Mekong River. From the river bank inland, the main roads running parallel to the river are Thanon Fa Ngum , Thanon Setthathirat and Thanon Samsenthai . The central district, Chanthabuli , contains most of Vientiane’s government offices, hotels and restaurants. Vientiane’s widest boulevard, Thanon Lane Xang , runs from the Presidential Palace (now used for government offices and for state receptions) to the northeast around Patuxai , the Victory Gate, towards Pha That Luang , the That Luang Stupa, the most important religious monument in Laos.

Get in

By plane

Vientiane’s Wattay Airport is 4 km west of the city. International services are quite limited, but this is slowly changing.

International flights

There are direct flights to/from:

 Bangkok Suvarnabhumi : Thai Airways two flights daily and Lao Airlines one. Hanoi (Viet Nam): Lao Airlines three times weekly and Vietnam Airlines daily. Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam): Vietnam Airlines daily via Phnom Penh Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia): Air Asia [1] three flights weekly on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Phnom Penh (Cambodia): Vietnam Airlines daily. Siem Reap (Cambodia): Lao Airlines three flights weekly via Pakse. Chiang Mai (Thailand): Lao Airlines six times weekly via Luang Prabang. Kunming (Yunnan, West China): China Eastern Airlines operate four and Lao Airlines three flights weekly. Lao Airlines and the Lao Consulate both have offices in the Camellia Hotel 

 Visas are available on arrival at the airport, and the fee is US$30 to 35 (depends on nationality). 60 day visas are now being issued on arrival. There is a US$10 departure tax for international flights, but this is being incorporated into the ticket cost so is not payable for many flights now.

From Bangkok many visitors choose to fly into Udon Thani in Thailand instead, and cross the border by bus, as this domestic flight is considerably cheaper than a direct international flight to Vientiane. There is a direct shuttle from Udon Thani airport to the Thai/Lao border at Nong Khai (about 50km away) for 150baht, and there are also direct cross-border bus services from Udon Thani (the city, not the airport!) to Vientiane. This option (flight plus bus transfers and immigration clearance at 2 points) takes at least 2 hours longer than a direct Bangkok to Vientiane flight. Attention: Thai Airways flies from Don Muang, the old Bangkok airport, and Thai Air Asia from Suvarnabhumi [2], the new Bangkok airport, to Udon Thani.

Domestic flights

 Lao Airlines flies to five domestic destinations (three to five flights daily to Luang Prabang; once or twice daily to Pakse, four times per week to Huay Xai and Oudomxay, and six times per week to Xieng Khuang (Phonsavan). 

 Lao Air , the second Lao airline, operates two flights weekly each between Vientiane and Phongsali, Samneua and Sayaboury (Sainyabuli) (aircraft: Cessna). 

Transfer to the city

Many hotels offer a pickup service from the airport, or you can take a jumbo or taxi for US$6. You can buy a taxi coupon before you leave the airport building for $6. Rides to the airport should be cheaper, around $3 by tuktuk.

By train

For now the railhead remains at Nong Khai, on the Thai side of the Friendship Bridge. However, the long-awaited extension across the river to Dongphosy (10 km from Vientiane) is finally nearing completion, and trains should start running across the border in March 2009.

Until the rail connection with Laos is completed rail travellers must take a tuk-tuk from Nong Khai station to the Thai border post at the bridge, cross the bridge by shuttle bus to the Lao border post, and from there make their way to Vientiane (some 16km) by taxi, tuk-tuk or bus.

By road

From Thailand

 The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge ( Saphan Mittaphap ) from Nong Khai, Thailand is the most common means of entry. The bridge cannot be crossed on foot or by bicycle, but there are frequent 20 baht shuttle buses just past Thai immigration. Bicycles can be carried on buses in the cargo compartment.

Direct buses to/from Nong Khai (30 baht) and Udon Thani (80 baht) arrive and depart from the Talat Sao bus terminal. These are cheap, comfortable, hassle-free and popular, so book ahead or arrive early. Schedules change often, currently the buses start at 8am and leave every 2 hours. Note: these buses are not an option if you plan to obtain a Lao visa on arrival at the bridge–the bus will not wait long enough.

Lao visas are available on arrival (until recently, only 15 day, but as of July 2006, this has increased to 30 days) and the official fee is US$35 for most EU or English speaking nations (India is US$40, Afghanistan US$42; countries not specially mentioned: US$30). There is a surcharge of US$1 outside working hours and on weekends. The fee is considerably higher if paid with Thai baht (about US$9 more at current exchange rates), so bring clean US$ notes. A passport photo is also required, however an extra 40 baht or US$1 can usually be paid if you’re unable to provide one (they’ll use a photocopy of your passport, although you can get copies made beforehand from a photocopier before the Thai departure desks for 2 baht each.). A 10 baht“entry fee”is charged once through, though walking straight past this desk seems not to be difficult.

Once through immigration, you can take a jumbo (posted price 150 baht, easy to bargain down to 100 baht or less for immediate departure with only one passenger) or taxi (200 baht) to any destination in the city. Shared jumbos are cheaper and local buses to Talat Sao cheapest of all, but signage is nonexistent and you may be in for a wait. You should be able to negotiate to a good deal less than 50 baht/person if you’re prepared to share (and possibly wait). It’s about 20km from the bridge to Vientiane; allow at least 30 minutes.

When arriving via the Friendship Bridge, you might like to visit the Buddha Park sculpture garden before going on to Vientiane, and save yourself a return trip back past the border crossing later. The same local bus that connects the Morning Market and the Friendship Bridge checkpoint also continues on to Buddha Park.

Going the opposite way, asking around the bus station for Friendship Bridge is effective. There are no immigration fees when exiting Laos via the Bridge, except at weekends when a token 2500 kip“overtime charge”applies.

Tickets from Vientiane to Udon Thani can only be bought from the Talat Sao bus station on the day itself for 22,000 kip.

The bridge immigration shuts quite late, around 10pm. But check with the locals if you are unsure. Although note that the Thai clock is very different to the western one, so using 24 hour time may be a better way to ask.

From Vietnam

A direct bus from Hanoi will take at least 20 hours (despite what the travel agents might say) and should cost about US$15-20.

From elsewhere in Laos

Buses to destinations in Vientiane Prefecture depart from the Talat Sao bus terminal, just east of the Morning Market. There is an informative schedule and schematic diagram of the bus piers painted on the central building, which is where you can also buy tickets.

The Southern Bus Terminal, used by all buses going south (including VIP), is on Thanon Kaisone Phomvihane (that is the first stretch of the“Route 13 South”), quite far from town leaving you at the mercy of the tuk-tuk bullies. Note that if you buy a ticket in town you should be able to get a free ride to the terminal.

The Northern Bus Terminal, somewhat north-west of the city center on the T2 road (now officially named Asiane Road), is where all buses to the north start.

Get around

Downtown Vientiane

Getting around Vientiane is generally easy, as the traffic is far less murderous than in larger Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh City. Street signage is, however, rather lacking though in the center more and more signs are appearing. Where there are signs displaying street names these are bilingual Lao and French. The Lao word“thanon”on these signs is translated by“rue”,“avenue”or“boulevard”, in many cases without any apparent logic. Therefore the Lao word“thanon”is used throughout this article.

The map on the right, which is fully to scale, covers the center only. Maps covering a larger area are available at bookshops and some mini-marts, but are not as detailed and not always to scale. Many storefronts feature addresses in Roman letters, and these are often the best way to determine the street one is walking. People navigate using landmarks, so name the nearest embassy, hotel or temple to where you want to go.

 Since 2006 a major road upgrading project has been going on in the town center and out of it up to way past the airport in the west and the Friendship Bridge in the east. Financed by the Japanese government and planned and overseen by Japanese engineers, the project is nearing completion (November 2007). Gone are the hazards presented by missing drainage gully covers and sidewalks upturned by tree roots. Almost no trees have been cut–amazing! In downtown Vientiane the through roads Thanons Setthathirat and Samsenthai and the side roads connecting them and down to the river now have sealed surfaces and sidewalks, and there is decent street lighting. A one-way traffic regime is in place (but not the police enforcing it), and parking regulations have also been introduced. Of course, it is still anarchy on the roads. Foreigners beware: markings for pedestrian crossings have been painted on the new roads, but the local drivers regard them as decoration. Don’t rely on them!

Vientiane’s rainwater drainage system, which also takes care of“grey water”from baths, sinks, laundry etc consists of gullies on the roadside, usually covered by concrete slabs. These slabs are sometimes damaged and very precariously balanced, or even missing altogether; people rapidly learn to take care before stepping on anything that looks like a slab! Waste from toilets is or should be collected in septic tanks (at every house), but those gullies can nevertheless smell abominably. In the center things have improved markedly as a result of the road upgrading. The smell from the gullies is now no longer very noticeable.

Note: do not rely on the Google Earth view of Vientiane for locating the sights: many locations put there by well-meaning users (the“Google Earth Community”) are clearly in the wrong place, not just a block or so away but some even in a wrong part of the town!

By taxi

Vientiane has a small fleet of genuine taxis retired from Bangkok, usually found lurking at the Friendship Bridge, the airport or in front of large hotels. Fares are set by bargaining, so figure on around US$0.50 per km or US$20-40 to hire one for the day, depending on car type and distance.

By tuk-tuk or jumbo

Tuk-tuks and their bigger cousins jumbos are ubiquitous in Vientiane. To charter a tuk-tuk/jumbo, agree on the fare in advance; short hops within the city shouldn’t cost more than 5000 kip, although as a tourist you may have difficulty bargaining to less than US$1 (10000K). All the tuk-tuk drivers carry a fare card for popular destinations but these fares are a bit inflated and a little negotiation is recommended. Share jumbos running on set routes, eg. Th Lan Xang to Pha That Luang, charge a fixed 1000K.

By bus

Minibuses connect the center to the suburban districts, but are not particularly useful for tourists, with the possible exception of the bus to the Friendship Bridge. The main terminal is on the east side of Talat Sao.

By bike

Bicycles are perhaps the best way to get around the city. Most guest houses and hotels can arrange bike rental for around US$2 per day. Although the city’s flat terrain makes for good biking, one-way streets can be difficult to identify.

Despite the poor standard of local driving, cycling is fairly safe in the city because the traffic is quite slow (maybe because of the condition of the roads). But take extra care when the roads are wet, because many are unsurfaced (even in the city center), and they can be muddy and slippery–innocent-looking puddles sometimes conceal deep potholes.

On foot

The city center can be quite comfortably covered on foot, at least in the cool season. Pha That Luang, however, is 4 km away from the center and thus a bit of a hike. Out of the city center there are few footpaths so walking can be uncomfortable.

See

Temples and Stupas

Some temples (indicated below) charge an entry fee of 2000/5000K for Lao/foreigners and are open 08:00-16:00, with a 12:00-13:00 lunch break. The monks of those that don’t charge a fee will be grateful for a small donation in the box.

Wat Si Saket, the oldest standing temple in Vientiane

 Wat Si Saket now signposted as Sisaket Museum . Entrance fee. Corner of Thanon Lane Xang and Thanon Setthathirat. Probably the oldest standing temple in Vientiane and among the most atmospheric. Built in 1818 by Chao Anou in the Bangkok style and hence left unsacked when much of Vientiane was razed in a Siamese raid in 1828. Now the oldest still standing temple in Vientiane. Within the cloister walls are hundreds of niches housing Buddha images large and small, made of wood, stone, silver and bronze. In the center of the courtyard is a five-tier-roofed sim (ordination hall) housing yet more Buddha niches and beautiful but fading murals of the Buddha’s past lives. 

 Haw Pha Kaew . Entrance fee. Thanon Setthathirat (opposite Wat Si Saket). King Setthathirat’s former royal temple, which housed the magical Emerald Buddha ( pha kaew ) after it was taken from Lanna (Chiang Mai). The Siamese took it back in 1779–the image is now housed in Bangkok’s Wat Phra Kaew–and came back in 1828 to raze the temple for good measure. The present structure is a 1942 reconstruction of dubious provenance. Today, the temple no longer operates and the interior has been turned into a small jumbled museum housing Buddha images; look out for the beautiful tall, lithe, long-armed Buddha in the hands-down“calling for rain”pose. 

 Black Stupa ( That Dam ). Thanon Bartholomie (off Thanon Samsenthai near the US embassy). The mythical abode of a seven-headed dragon that protects Vientiane. It was renovated in 1995 but still has an attractive patina of age, and is slowly being overgrown again by vegetation. 

 Pha That Luang . Entrance fee. Thanon That Luang (2 km east from Patuxai). The national symbol and most important religious monument of the country, That Luang is a three-layered gilded stupa. The current version dates from 1566, although it has been ransacked and renovated numerous times since then. Closed Mondays.
 Vientiane’s most important festival, Bun That Luang , is held here in November on the night of the full moon. There are two temples beside That Luang: Wat That Luang Neua to the north and Wat That Luang Tai to the south, both presently being renovated. 
 

 Wat Si Muang . Between Thanons Setthatirat and Samsenthai, about 1km east of the center. Despite its small size, the temple is very active and houses the city pillar. Followers believe that lifting the small buddha statue 3 times from its cushion means that your prayers or questions will be answered. 

 Wats Onteu, Inpeng, Mixay and Haisok are along Thanon Setthatirat right in the town center, and therefore the most likely temples to be visited by travelers. 

There are many more temples all over the town, but it must be said that if you are out to admire temples Luang Prabang is the place to go, not Vientiane.

Other

Patuxai, the Victory Gate

 Patuxai (“Victory Gate”). A local rendition of Paris’ Arc de Triomphe . Besides the elaborate Buddhist embellishment, it differs from the original in having four gates instead of two and being just a bit higher (to spite the French). Reasonably impressive from afar, a surprisingly frank English sign inside the monument labels it a“monster of concrete”when seen up close–and the concrete in question was donated by the US, although it was supposed to go towards a new airport instead. The monument itself aside, the palm tree-lined park around it complete with fountains is quite pleasant though lacking of shade during the day time, and you can climb up to the 7th story (stairs only) for a view of downtown Vientiane. 

 Lao National Museum . Thanon Samsenthai (next to Lao Plaza Hotel). Formerly the Lao Revolutionary Museum by name, the historical exhibits on the first floor are modest though very interesting in depicting some of the early history. They include one of the original Jars from the Plain of Jars and various stone and bronze age implements. There has been some attempt to label in English, though it is sporadic. The second floor provides us with a great insight into the 18th Century Laotian Kingdom and the customs of the day. It would appear that the Loatians didn’t treat their guests quite as well in those days, often keeping them from leaving the country for several months. The floor builds up to a fervently revolutionary pitch as it documents the heroic struggle of the Lao against the Siamese, French and American‘imperialists’. Exhibits include items such as socks worn by Politburo members when they escaped from prison and Kaysone Phomvihane’s chest expander. The final rooms, on post-revolutionary Laos, are mostly a photo gallery of pressing topics such as the comrades of the 7th Plenary Session of the Laos People’s Congress inspecting fertilizer production processes. The final rooms provide an insight into some of the modern advancements, though these are fairly dowdy and uninspiring. Visitors are forced to walk through the shop (items look like they have been on sale since the revolution in 1975). A guestbook regularly features amusing arguments between young western visitors on the subject of communism. Most exhibits patchily labeled in English and/or French. Entry 10,000K, open daily from 08:00 to 16:00. Bags must be checked in at the front desk. No cameras are allowed. 

Nearby

Buddha Park

 Buddha Park ( Xieng Khuan ) is a bizarre outdoor collection of huge concrete sculptures of Buddhist and Hindu deities and real and imaginary beasts. The reclining Buddha is especially impressive. Built in 1958 by mystic Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who left the country after the communist take-over and, in 1978, went on to establish a nearly identical park ( Sala Keoku or Sala Kaew Ku ) across the river in Nong Khai, Thailand. Located some 24 km from the city, it’s about 6 km to the east of the Friendship Bridge–hence it’s well worth visiting on the way into or out of Laos if you’re crossing the Friendship Bridge, thereby saving you an extra 48 km round trip if you visit from and return to Vientiane. Getting transportation from the Buddha park can be difficult so it is best to hire a tuk-tuk for the entire Vientiane–buddha park–friendship bridge (or vice versa) trip. 

 On the main road (Thanon Thadeua), just before the access road to the Bridge branches off, is the National Ethnic Cultural Park where typical houses of various ethnic groups are on display, though only from the outside unless you happen to meet some kind of custodian who will be eager to unlock some of them and show the inside. There also are some statues of dinosaurs and a rather dismal looking small“zoo”. Most times the only activity seems to be the kiosks where they sell soft drinks and chips, but there are said to be occasional cultural shows. Tour operators often take their guests here before or after a visit to the Buddha Park. Well, to have it in their brochures may serve to make those more impressive. It is not a place to go out of your way for, not as long as it is not made more attractive. 

Do

 Apart from exploring the city itself there are several worthwile trips into the surrounding countryside on offer. Some can be done independently, some are offered by commercial agencies. Within one to two hours from Vientiane you can go kayaking, wild-water rafting, trekking through nature parks, etc.

A reputable agency organising adventure tours and eco-tourism is Green Discovery Laos [3] in Thanon Setthathirat next to Kop Chei Deu.

An agency organising rent car,airplane ticket,tour arrangement is Naga Express Travel Tour [4] operator specialized in Vientiane&amp;Luang Prabang.(Lao.P.D.R).]

The local people love to go picnicking at some of the rivers or on the shores of Nam Ngum Lake , about 90km from Vientiane. There are floating restaurants along the lake shore; their specialty is fish fresh from the lake. Cruises among the lake’s islands can be booked here, which makes for a relaxing couple of hours. Just inquire at your guest house/hotel or at any travel agency (where they will then try to sell their tours).

Hurting legs and backs from a day roaming the city? Go for a traditional Lao massage . There are lots of massage places all over the town, from“holes in the wall”to upscale establishments. Prices range from US$3-6/hour, more for the truly luxurious spa-like places where you will really be pampered (for instance Papaya Spa [5], on a road parallel to the river facing Xieng Veh temple about 2km from the city center). There’s also excellent massage and herbal sauna in Wat Sok Pa Luang (30.000kip 1h massage, 10.000kip sauna).

All these establishments are 100% aboveboard and legitimate: this is not Bangkok! Your masseur or masseuse will be grateful for a tip. The staff will be happy if you have the decency to take a shower before you go there. They won’t say anything to your face, but smelly foreigners make their job less than pleasant.

Buy

 Banks and exchange offices are located throughout the city center. Phongsavanh Bank on Thanon Samsenthai is Vientiane’s newest and privately owned bank and operates a currency exchange until about 16:30 on weekdays, and for shorter hours on weekends. They charge a 1% fee. BCEL’ s main foreign exchange counter is located on the corner of Thanon Fa Ngum (the river promenade) and Thanon Pang Kham, charges no commission, and has longer opening hours than most local banks. Other banks in the city have exchange facilities too, including two or three booths of BCEL within Talat Sao.

 ATM s can now be found throughout the city, but sometimes run out of money (their stock of kip gets exhausted in the course of the day). Furthermore, the range of international credit and debit cards accepted depends on the bank operating the ATM. If one does not work for you, try the next one, or come back later. As the maximum amount per withdrawal is about 100 USD the fees charged by the local bank and the one bank home may render cash withdrawal an expensive option. You might be better off with traveller cheques, dollars and Thai baht which are all readily accepted. Most foreigners living in Vientiane withdraw Thai baht from ATMs in Thailand and then exchange baht for kip as needed.

 BCEL : Withdrawals are limited to 700,000 kip per transaction (a bit more than 70 USD); however, you may make up to ten of these in one day. Mastercard and Maestro are readily accepted; Visa is currently not. BCEL charges a fee of 20,000 kip per transaction. Other local banks : Maximum withdrawal 1,000,000 kip per withdrawal, maximum 3 withdrawals/day. 

Normally, no-one will want to withdraw large amounts of kip, because Thai baht and US$ are almost universally accepted at stores and restaurants; some places also accept Euros. In some restaurants the bill will state the amount in kip and US$, baht or Euro or any combination of these. The Government tries to persuade its people to always use only kip, but at the same time its own offices and institutions will gladly accept US$ or even bill their services in US$.

 Credit cards are accepted by travel agencies and in better restaurants and shops, but many charge a 3% fee, take it or leave it.

Markets

 Morning Market ( Talat Sao –corner of Thanon Lane Xang and Thanon Khu Vieng)–a large collection of indoor stalls selling, well, pretty much anything. There are two floors: the first floor sells mostly textiles, electronics, and watches; the second floor has clothing, gold, and jewelery. Expect to pay about one third or one quarter of the first price you are offered. Despite the name it is still struggling into operation at 09:00 and remains open until around 16:00. 
 The old buildings are being replaced by modern structures–at present (December 2007) one of these is completed: the Talat Sao Mall . See below under Department stores. 
Handicraft Shops

Above all silk and cotton weavings, are for sale in the Morning Market and in many shops along Thanons Setthathirat and Samsenthai, and in several of their side roads. In the Morning Market you should bargain; in the other shops you may try to get a rebate but don’t count on it. Some of the better shops are:

 Mixay Boutic (yes, that’s how they write it) in Thanon Nokeo Kumman (with a branch in Thanon Setthathirat)–they have some women weaving fabrics of the shop’s own design on the premises, who you are welcome to watch. Beautiful wall hangings, not the cheapest in town but well worth the price. Also on sale are shirts and skirts, scarves, cushion covers and anything made of textiles. Laha Boutique , Thanon Francois Ngin: naturally dyed textiles (mainly cotton) from the south (Savannakhet). Kanchana: the Beauty of Lao Silk : traditional Lao silk weavings, hand-woven fabrics, textiles and clothing using natural dyes. Just off Thanon Samsenthai on Thanon Chantha Kumman, the road to That Dam. Lao Textiles , Thanon Nokeo Kumman. Founded 1990 by an American woman (Carol Cassidy), who now employs some 40 artisans, this firm offers modern weavings using traditional motifs–some of their work has been exhibited in museums. Prices are accordingly, but if you can afford them you will get something to be proud of. Not the usual backpacker’s souvenirs… The Art of Silk , Thanon Manthatulat, run by the Lao Women’s Union. Silk and cotton weavings in both traditional and modern designs. Mulberries Lao Sericulture Company , Thanon Nokeo Kumman. The sales outlet of a not-for-profit organisation that operates in about five hundred villages in Northern Laos, seeking to create income generating opportunities. Naturally-dyed, handmade Lao silk products. 

Supermarkets and Department Stores

Need a toothbrush or nail clipper? Or just fed up with rice or noodle soup three times a day, and craving for a self-composed picnic? Visit one of the many “minimarts” where you may well find whatever you’re looking for. Some of the best-stocked of these are

 Phimphone Minimart on Thanon Setthathirat next to JoMa. Opened again after renovations end December 2007, it is no longer merely a“minimart”but almost a full-grown supermarket. This place will surprise you in the amount of western stock it carries, but it isn’t cheap, and the owners must make a nice profit on the exchange rate that they apply. Here it pays to pay in kip! A second shop with the same name (the owners are related, the shops are not) is located on Thanon Samsenthai / corner of Thanon Chantha Kumman. V-Shop on Thanon Khun Bulom netween Thanons Setthathirat and Samsenthai. Outside in front is a small express café where they serve some of the best coffee specialties in town ( Lao Mountain Coffee ), shakes, fuit juices, waffles, donuts – good for people watching on the edge of the chinese quarter. Riverside Minimart on Thanon Fa Ngum, the Mekong promenade. City Minimart on Thanon Samsenthai opposite Wat Si Muang–maybe the shop with the most extensive range of merchandise in the town, and somewhat cheaper than the shops more in the center. 
 All of these offer groceries from Europe, wines from all over the world (thanks to the low taxation in Laos these are astonishingly low-priced considering the long transport routes); dairy products from Laos itself and Thailand (milk, yoghurt), butter and cheese from Europe and New Zealand, and everything else one may need. 
 Vientiane Department Store was at the center of the Lane Xang side of the Morning Market and is now (end 2007) being torn down to be replaced by a second new building. Many of the shops that were here have been relocated to the Talat Sao Mall . This has 3 floors and is the first public building in Vientiane with an indoor parking. At weekends folks from the countryside come and marvel at the escalators (which, in one local magazine article, were referred to in English as“electricity ladders”), and at the bravery of those who venture onto them. The Mall boasts a few cafés and a thai-style food court. 

Books

 There is a real book store, Monument Books on Thanon Nokeo Kumman next to the Vayakorn Guesthouse. Good selection of english and french language books and magazines.Several stores around town offer book buy/sell/exchange services; some of the tomes on the shelves look as if they have been on a long, long trip in a back pack, but you can find interesting stuff here. 

Bicycle

 Simple Chinese bicycles and Mountain Bikes can be found in the Morning Market (Talat Sao) and in a few shops in the surrounding streets. Prices for a single gear bike start at about 50$, Mountainbikes at about 80$. 

 Top Cycle Zone , 47 Dong Palan, is the place to go if you want to buy a decent western style bicycle–or spare parts for one. Prices for a Mountain Bike start at about 350$. 

Eat

There are many restaurants in Vientiane. They offer a wide selection of cuisines, from Chinese specialities to Tex-Mex. More restaurants are opened all the time, but many are there for just a few months before they go under; a few are successful and stay and may even flourish. It’s a question of offering something special, either in the way of the food served, or the atmosphere, or the friendly and competent service. The following is only a small selection.

Budget

 Noodle shops can be found all over the town. They typically serve Vietnamese-type noodle soups (pho), often also fried rice and other rice or noodle-based dishes. Prices are very moderate: around 1 USD for a large bowl or plate. There really is no need to go hungry in this town, but it is advisable to eat in places where there are many customers: there the food is likely to be good and fresh. Avoid empty places where the only guests are the flies buzzing around the food on display. 

 Ban Anou Night Market is only about 1 block long and starts setting up at sundown, but it has some of the best cheap eats in town. There’s a wide range of street snacks available, including pho made with handpulled noodles, little lettuce wrapped snacks with peanut filling (miang), all types of grilled skewered meats, grilled sticky rice and more…. 

A selection of more“sophisticated”eateries follows:

 Just for Fun , Thanon Pangkham (the road running from the river at BCEL to the Fountain): simpe and comfortable, good Western, Thai and Lao food, also vegetarian dishes. 

 PVO , which used to be at Thanon Samsenthai, has moved to a location on the river road, opposite the BCEL bank. It serves excellent Vietnamese food and the pho isn’t bad, but for many the best eats here are the stuffed baguettes (7000/14000K for half/full). English menu, open 08:00-20:00. 

 Along the river : dozens of unpretentious restaurants and beer gardens, from opposite the BCEL bank strung along the Mekong for approximately 2km upriver. All are pleasant places for a beer and a snack or a complete meal while the sun goes down over the river. One of these is one-time famous John’s Restaurant , but since the owner married an Australian and left for down under there is nothing to distinguish it from the other places left and right. All serve inexpensive Lao and some Western food. Among the best is the grilled fish, served by many of them. Take care when you’re in for boiled eggs: what you get here are incubated duck eggs. When you open them you’re in for a surprise (but at least the little bird does not chirp). The Lao love them, they are hugely popular.In 2005 one of the eateries along the river put Lao-style reed mats on the ground with low rattan“tables”( ka toke ); diners sit cross-legged on the mat around the table. These became so popular that they can now be found at many of these establishments. They are much nicer than the rickety metal tables and plastic chairs that are the standard of all but the better restaurants in Laos. 

 Mekong Deck : a new place on the river, near PVO. This one stands out from the competition upriver because of the way it’s laid out; it is a very nice place to nurse a beer and enjoy the company of friends. 

 Sunset Bar (Sala Sunset) at the very western end of the Mekong river road. Popular with expats and tourists. The main things to recommend it are the sunsets (and those are not of their doing) and the rickety construction of wood apparently salvaged from demolished buildings. When the river is really high parts of the terrace sometimes wash away. Truly romantic! The beer is cold and whiling away an hour or so under the tree canopy with a bottle or two and some snacks can be very relaxing indeed. 

Mid-range

 Up 2 U just off of Thanon Lane Xang. Call Nok for English reservations/directions on (+856)206711784 11AM-11PM . 5 mins walk from the Morning Market this restuarant offers a good selection of Lao‘BBQ’dishes and soups as well as the usual rice dishes. The restuarant is situated just off the main road next to a large fishing pond surrounded by colonial houses–a welcome change from the busy riverfront. Good selection of beers&amp;beverages also avaliable. Approx $5 -$8 per person. Popular with locals–Highly recommended. 

 Café Indochine , Thanon Setthathirat. Authentic Vietnamese food–particularly recommended: the set meals at about 4 to 5 USD. 

 Le Provençal at Nam Phu (the Fountain)–good French fare, excellent pizzas. Main courses from about 4 to 10 USD. 

 Lotus Restaurant , next to Cultural Hall. Serves traditional Lao and Western food, 08:30 am–11:30 pm. Price range: 2-4 USD, VISA and Master Card accepted. Khop Chai Deu , near the fountain. Inside (2 floors) and outside seating. Very good Lao, Thai, Indian and Western food. Competent and friendly service. Open until late evening. Price range: 1-4 USD. Try the “Lao Discovery” menu at 6.5 USD (but check with the waiter how spicy it all is…). Noisy low-quality bands play Western popular music some evenings. Also a bar (see below). Buffet at lunchtime. 

 Hong Kong Restaurant , opposite Lao Plaza Hotel. Excellent Cantonese dishes (2 USD–approx. 9 USD) and a small selection of dim sum (1 USD per plate). There have been reports of them padding the bill. Check the bill carefully before paying! (That, by the way, is something you should do everywhere: in a country where they use a calculator to subtract 7 from 10 it comes as no surprise that their counting of beers consumed is not always accurate. To be fair, the mistakes are not always to the disadvantage of the customer.) 

 Inter Hotel Restaurant –Quai Fa Ngum, riverside, well prepared Szechuan food, about 3 USD/dish. The hotel also runs the Inter Stone House in the same building round the corner; about the same or a slightly higher price range. Western and Thai/Lao food; their specialty is the sizzling steak on a stone platter, which however is not recommended (rather leathery meat with maltreated french fries and tasteless vegs). 

 JoMa , Thanon Setthathirat, and Scandinavian Bakery in the fountain square, extremely popular air-conditioned cafés and bakeries with simple lunches and excellent cakes and coffee. Wifi internet at JoMa for a modest fee. TV showing CNN upstairs at the Scandinavian. 

 Le Croissant d’Or and Banneton Café , almost next to each other in Thanon Nokeo Kumman (running from the river to Thanon Setthathirat) have croissants and pastries and serve simple lunches. Banneton sells the best baguettes in town–tasty, not just something to chew. Their coffee is among the best in Vientiane. The owners of Le Croissant d’Or also run the Vista café in Thanon François Ngin (free wifi internet when you spend 15,000 kip on food and drink). 

 Sticky Fingers –Thanon François Ngin opposite the Tai Pan Hotel. Quality western style food at reasonable prices. There’s happy hour on Wednesday and Friday nights, including half price cocktails. 

 Full Moon Café , almost next to Sticky Fingers, nice interior with comfortable seating arrangements. Serves what they call fusion fare. Reasonable prices. 

 La Terrasse , Thanon Nokeo Kumman, is popular with expats and tourists alike. It is one of the best French restaurants in Vientiane (very good pizzas, and excellent tender steaks at about 5 US$). Set three-course lunch is 5.50 USD, main dishes up to 10 USD. 

 Nazim Indian Restaurant on the Mekong river road: decent Indian food. Their washroom is not the cleanest in the country, perhaps because the patrons of some of the eateries on the river bank are directed here for certain needs (when they are not simply sent down to the reeds at the water’s edge). Nazim has opened a branch in Thanon Pang Kham, opposite the offices of Lao Airlines. (No reports on their washroom yet). 

 Khao Nieow is a new place in Thanon Nokeo Kumman, almost next to La Terrasse. Set three-course meals at 4.50 USD. Steaks in two qualities: Lao beef at around 4 or 5 USD; New Zealand lamb and beef at about 8 USD and above. To be tried on a cool evening: the fondue bourguignonne at 26 USD for two and, a surprise in a place whose name means“Sticky Rice”, excellent cheese fondue at 28 USD for two–not something for the hottest months of the year, but nice around the year’s end when temperatures drop. 

 The restaurant in the Lane Xang Hotel on Thanon Fa Ngum has traditional Lao music and dance performances every evening from about 7pm, which you watch while eating your dinner of (recommended) Lao food. Get there early to secure a table with a good view of the stage. A meal for four, consisting of 5 or 6 dishes including drinks, will come at about 30 USD. 

 Kua Lao at Thanon Samsenthai. Authentic Lao food with a good selection of vegetarian dishes; traditional Lao music and dance performances in the evening. Main dishes from 6 to about 12 USD; set meals (recommended!) at 15 USD. Expensive for Lao food. 

 Le Côte d’Azur on Thanon Fa Ngum: a favourite of the expat community, serving generous helpings of mainly French food. 

 The Spirit House on that tree-shaded part of the river promenade that has not yet been“upgraded”to Lao-style sterile banality like the stretch downriver (there are plans for it, but fortunately the money seems to have run out). It is about 0.5km upstream from the end of the paved portion of the road. Predominantly a cocktail bar, it also offers various meals and bar snacks at highish prices. Watch the waiters jump the puddles in the rainy season when you’ve chosen to sit outside on the terrace across the potholed road. 

 Moon the Night Restaurant . Another 0.5km farther upstream from the Spirit House and somewhat difficult to find: the river promenade ends a few hundred meters before – best to take a tuk-tuk. (Directions: from the Novotel 0.5km west, direction airport, past the FORD showroom, then turn into a soi on the left which after 200 meters takes you to the river. There ask around). A very pleasant spot to eat excellent Lao food. A large place, an extensive menu, competent and friendly service. Background music not too loud. Highly recommended. A meal of 6 to 8 dishes for 4 people comes at 15 to 20 US$ including drinks. 

 Phonethip Coca Suki Restaurant , Thanon Sailom opposite the Lao Telecom Service Center. Part of a chain that also has restaurants in Thailand and Indonesia. Good Lao, Thai, Chinese and Western food. Reasonable prices and good, attentive service. Very popular at lunch time with office workers and students. 

 Kop Kap , across from Tat Luang Temple. A favorite among ex-pats living nearby, if you crave Thai food. Packed during lunch time, the restaurant is known for its excellent Penang curry. Closed Sundays. 

 Evening Dinner Cruises on the river – two different companies, on boat moored opposite Wat Chan and one 300 metres upriver. Not very impressive, neither the boat trip (1 hour, departure around 7pm: 1 km upstream then 2 downstream and back–only when the water level is high enough) nor the food. But very relaxing. This Lao maritime experience will cost you only slightly more than the same meal in one of the beer gardens on the river bank. 

Splurge

 Nam Phou . The first and arguably the best of the restaurants around the Fountain (Nam Phu), with good food and exceptional service. A favourite of NGO types. 

 L’Opera : at the Fountain; good Italian food (but not quite comparable to what you get in the owner’s home country). Good pizzas. Don’t go there if you cannot stand opera music–it is played continuously in the background though not, fortunately, so loud that it drowns the conversation. 

 Le Central on Thanon Setthathirat: good western food, main courses at 8 to 15 USD. 

 Le Silapa on Thanon Sihom (the road leading off the Setthathirat/Khun Bulom intersection), a small atmospheric restaurant with excellent French food and a good wine list. Main courses start at about 6 USD. 

 Le Nadao opposite the Patuxai park, excellent classical French fare, main courses starting at 8 USD. Booking recommended (Tel. 021-213174). 

 La Belle Epoque in the Settha Palace Hotel–excellent food in an atmosphere of colonial elegance. Main courses starting at 8 USD. 

 Balkan House, Yugoslav restaurant, Thongsangnang village. Traditional Yugoslav and Mediterranean homemade dishes, prepared by Montenegrin chef. Cooked and baked dishes, meat and fish specialties, traditional salads, grilled dishes, authentic Bosnian pie’s, promises unforgettable experience at the pleasantly house style ambience. Fresh homemade bread, traditionally served with every delicious gourmet meal, is just one more guarantee of fully satiscaftion. Place where you can relax, enjoying a nice portions of real, good and quality food . Opens from 8am-3pm&amp;6pm-11pm, closed on Monday. Tel: 020 7709 729 From US$5-15.  edit 

Drink

Sunset and Beerlao by the Mekong

Vientiane has a few bars/clubs, but there’s no shortage of places for a quiet Beerlao. In particular, the Mekong shoreline is packed with near-identical but pleasant bamboo-and-thatch beer gardens offering cold beer and spicy snacks.

 Bor Pen Nyang , Thanon Fa Ngum (the river promenade), tel. +856-20-7873965, [6]. Breezy fourth-floor (no elevator) bar/restaurant which overlooks the Mekong. Live bands every night. Travellers, locals and ex-pats in seeming harmony. Claims the most extensive Fine Whisky Range in Laos and stocks a wide range of liquors, including absinthe on Thursdays for $2/shot. Pool&amp;Snooker Tables on the 2nd Floor. 

 Martini Lounge , Thanon Nokeo Kummane, just a block from the Mekong and next door to Croissant d’Or Bakery. Opens at 6:00 pm and closes well past the normal 11:30 curfew. Movies shown Monday-Wednesday 8:00pm. Thursdays are Salsa nights and most Fridays a DJ is spinning. Don’t forget to checkout the chill’n second floor AND the Mango Martini. The place in Vientiane to find the most eclectic music mix. 

 Jazzy-Brick , Thanon Setthathirat nearly opposite Kop Chai Deu. The classiest and most expensive bar in town. The sign out front states“no shorts, no flip-flops allowed”. 

 Samlor Pub , Thanon Setthathirat opposite Wat Onteu. It has long been one of only a few bars in town, and was packed every evening. A lot quieter now that there is more competition. Has pool table and shows sports, but the“background”music often drowns the TV commentary. Tends to stay open later than other bars listed here. 

 Khop Chai Deu [7] Thanon Setthathirat next to the fountain square. The name means“thank you very much”, and despite the prices, this is usually the most active place in this part of town until action moves on to one of the discos. 

 Deja Vu , next to L’Opera Restaurant on Nam Phu Square (Fountain), a very classy and cozy bar, owned and run by Japanese-speaking Lao owner. Closed Sundays. 

There are two clubs near the Novotel hotel:

 DTech , in the hotel grounds. Mainly techno. 

 Future , just outside. 80s and 90s songs with a big video screen. 

Note that everything is supposed to close down before midnight before the start of the unofficial curfew, although clubs generally stay open until 1-1.30am. The most notable exception is the extremely popular Don Chan Palace Hotel Nightclub which is open until 4am on the weekend.

Now that the closing time is more strictly enforced (December 2006), the popularity of the bowling alley has increased again, as it is open and serving customers for 24 hours a day.

Sleep

 There are numerous places to stay in Vientiane, from very basic guest houses with dormitory-type rooms to comfortable upscale boutique hotels, with prices from very moderate to mid-range and higher. In recent years many new establishments have opened, but mid-2007 the Government announced plans to restrict the number of new permits: they wish to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. The days that anyone could convert their home to a guest house and partake of the boom seem to be over.

Normally, just get into the town center (for instance the Nam Phu square) and start looking around along Thanon Setthathirat and its side streets. You’ll find something within minutes except it’s“high season”(January) where it will be really difficult to find room: book in advance!

Room rates may vary depending on the season: high season is something like October through April or May; low season June through September.

Some places insist on an early nightly curfew and lock the front door without giving you a key. If you wish to enjoy the nightlife (what there is of it), make sure that you will be able to stay out and, more importantly, get in again.

The Lao Hotel and Restaurant Association [8] has an extensive list of hotels in Vientiane. The following is just a small selection.

Budget

 Sabaidy Guest House, 203 Thanon Settathirat. Has lockers to keep your belongings in. Close to downtown, dormitories with no doors or sheets on a bed for 20000 kips.  edit 

 Vayakorn Guest House, 91 Thanon Nokeo Kumman (just off Thanon Setthathirat). Opened in 2003. Very clean, well-appointed rooms with wood floors, air-con. Helpful and friendly staff. Rates: US$ 22.00–US$ 25.00.  edit 

 Auberge du Temple, Thanon Luang Prabang (next to Wat Khunta). A bit far from the city centre, but a very pleasant guest house owned by a French-Swiss gentleman  edit 

 Lane Xang Hotel, Thanon Fa Ngum. A majestic old hotel from decades ago, built 1960. It is one of the oldest hotels in Vientiane. Boasted the first elevator in the country. The charm of past glory–see the bathroom fittings! Hunter S. Thompson wrote dispatches from here after scrambling out of Saigon as it fell. They claim that English, French, Japanese, Thai, Russian, Vietnamese and (would you believe it?) Lao are spoken. Room rate 30 -50 US$ incl breakfast.  edit 

 Asian Pavilion Hotel, 379 Thanon Samsenthai. A good if not quite their self-proclaimed“fascinating”mid-range choice formerly known as Hotel Constellation–as recorded in John le Carré’s The Honourable Schoolboy –and Hotel Vieng Vilay. Rooms from US$26 with air-con, hot water, cable TV, breakfast and airport transfer..  edit 

 Chanthapanya Hotel, Thanon Nokeo Kummane. Owned and operated by the Chanthapanya family the hotel offers the charm of a family guest house while providing the comfort of a hotel. All rooms have A/C, Wi-Fi access, personal safe (too small for a notebook PC), cable TV, 24hr hot water. Wi-Fi access points are on floors 2 and 4, and reception is best there. Beware unpleasant smells from air con in some top floor rooms, and ask for a room with a view (meaning not the view of the neighbors’wall). They lock up early–check with Reception! From US$35 per room per night.  edit 

 Inter City Hotel, 24-25 Thanon Fa Ngum (the river road), [9]. Totally renovated in 2004, now a boutique hotel. Ask for a room with a view of the river. Has rooms and corridors filled with countless statues with fierce faces, which generates a spooky feeling for some. Rooms are equally spooky, so check out the room before you check-in. WiFi is provided for free and there are also two free computers in the lobby. Note: the hotel location is not marked on the map, though it is given in the map legend (H6)–it is where the Inter Restaurant is marked(Restaurant 8). Room prices from 35 US$ (standard room) to 61 US$ (deluxe).  edit 

 Beau Rivage Mekong Hotel, Thanon Fa Ngum (On the river road but at the shady tree-lined stretch that has not yet been “developed”, a few hundred meters upriver from where the road has been asphalted), [10]. New, very nice. All rooms have WiFi internet, courtesy of the HBRM spirit house next door. Room prices from 40 to 70 US$ depending on season and single or double occupancy.  edit 

 Lani Guest House, Thanon Setthathirat (next to Wat Haisok), [11]. An old, French colonial-style house in a small garden set back from the main road. A quiet place to relax yet right in the center of downtown. Prices from 27.50 (single) to 38.50 US$ (double).  edit 

 Orchid Guest House, Thanon Fa Ngum. Rooms from 12 (single) to 15 US$ (double)..  edit 

Splurge

 Settha Palace Hotel, 6 Pang Kham Street (right at the end of the street, north from Nam Phu past Lao Plaza and Day Inn Hotels), [12]. Built circa 1932, the luxurious Hotel has been restored to its former charm. Re-opened in 1999, the French colonial architecture, its period furniture and its landscaped gardens with a free-form pool, complemented by modern facilities, are some of the features of this historical landmark in the heart of Vientiane. If you see a London taxicab cruising the streets, it’s theirs, used to ferry guests around. They have an excellent restaurant “La Belle Epoque” (see below) and an open air sidewalk café. Room rates from US$ 105.  edit 

 Green Park Boutique Hotel and Resort, Thanon Ku Vieng (About 1km east from the Morning Market), [13]. A newer boutique hotel built in Lao style–several buildings in a garden setting. Nice pool. It is somewhat away from the center, but ideal to “get away from the bustle”. Recent guest complaints about lost or stolen items have been verified by local authorities. Be careful with your belongings at this hotel. (Shuttle bus to downtown area every hour until 22.00 PM). Room rates depend on season and start at 100 to 125 USD (single); 110 to 130 (double)..  edit 

 Don Chan Palace, (far out at the eastern end of the river promenade), [14]. This hotel is completed in 2004, almost complies with the municipality’s town planning by-laws which at the time limited buildings in Vientiane to 4 storeys (Don Chan has 14). The place is an eyesore. Several restaurants; swimming pool; and a popular open-air beer garden overlooking the Mekong which gets crowded late in the evening. Not really recommended as a place to stay: too far from the center–there are many much nicer hotels with more character downtown, where you’ll pay a lot less. Careful when shopping for jewelry in the shops in the lobby: there’s not only real gold and gems on sale! Rooms at Don Chan: from $130.  edit 

Respect

Long trousers and sleeves are recommended.

Contact

 Post and Telephone : see the section on“Contact”in the article about Laos

 Internet cafes are ubiquitous in Vientiane, particularly along Thanon Samsenthai and the east end of Thanon Setthathirat. The going rate as of September 2007 is 100K/minute, usually charged in 10 minute increments.

 FastestNet . Thanon Samsenthai ( between Lao Plaza and Asian Pavilion ). Lives up to its name fairly well and charges the standard 100K/min. No firewalls or program install restrictions. 

Stay healthy

Water

The city’s waterworks are called Nam PaPaa, which means“water without fishes”. Yes, the fishes have been removed but not everything else. Don’t drink the tap water–stick to the bottled water available everywhere.

Mosquito-borne diseases

Vientiane is free from malaria, but dengue is a real threat, especially during the rainy season. Take the necessary precautions against mosquito bites by wearing DEET repellent–available to purchase at any minimart.

Stray dogs

Some of them can be vicious. If you’re bitten see a doctor. Even if you’ve had a rabies vaccination before your trip: you will still need a booster jab.

Swimming

 Don’t follow the example of the locals who will bathe in anything that looks like water. There is a real risk of picking up parasites! Swimming in public pools is okay. There is one in a kind of garden setting on Thanon Sok Paluang, and another, not in such a nice setting, on the road by the Stadium.

Hotel pools are also safe. Some hotels with pools that you can use for a fee if you’re not staying there: Novotel, Lao Plaza, Don Chan Palace, Settha Palace–and there are more. Recommended: the Sunday brunch at the Novotel at c. US$ 10 including use of the pool.

Hospitals

In Vientiane

Vientiane’s hospitals are a far cry from those in the West or even in Thailand. Mahosot and Setthathirat Hospitals can treat common conditions but for anything more serious you’re better off heading to Thailand (see below) where there are good private hospitals with USA or Europe trained doctors.

For emergency dental treatment it’s also best to go to Thailand; in Vientiane’s dental clinics they seem to resort to tooth extractions a bit too easily.

Mahosot Hospital is on the river (go to their“International Clinic”where you pay more and get more personal service, but from the same doctors that work in the hospital itself); Setthathirat Hospital is away from downtown on the T4 Road .

 Medical Center : Centre Médical de l’Ambassade de France Medical . With the support of the French Embassy in Vientiane, the “Centre Medical de l’Ambassade de France” opened its doors to the foreign community in Laos in April 2007. The medical centre provides primary health care, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, along with paramedical services, including dental care, physiotherapy, speech therapy and psychotherapy, to all the expatriates and tourists in Vientiane. Practice Dr. Jean Marie HOSPIED; Bvd Kouvieng . Simuang BP 7168.Vientiane. Laos Tel / Fax: 856 21 214150 cmaflao@gmail.com

 Australian Embassy Clinic . The Australian Embassy Clinic provides limited general practice services with a small pharmacy and pathology department. Although the clinic is primarily for diplomatic staff and their families, Australian citizens may access its services on a fee for service basis. Reciprocal arrangements with other embassies means that citizens from certain other countries may also access the service. The clinic is located at the Australian Embassy at Km4 on Thadeua Road. Phone number: +856 [0] 21353840. Clinic Hours: 8.30-12.30 and 13.30-17.00 Monday to Friday. There is no after hours service.

In Thailand

Recommended hospitals close to Vientiane are:

 Wattana Hospital in Nong Khai, good for treating simpler cases. Tel. from Laos 0066-42-465201. Aek Udon International Hospital in Udon Thani, has more facilities. Tel. from Laos 0066-42-342555. Ambulance services to Thailand: The ambulances of Wattana Hospital can cross the border to pick up patients in Vientiane; they can also take them to Aek Udon Hospital. Ambulances of Setthathirat Hospital (Tel. 021-351156) can also cross the border.The bridge is open from 06:00 am till 10:00 pm; outside these hours the gates are only opened for emergencies upon telephone request from the hospital. 

Stay safe

Vientiane is a fairly safe city in terms of crime. However, bag snatching from guests sitting in front of cafes is becoming more common. Bags in the baskets of (rented) bicycles or mopeds, even when moving along, are also far from safe. Do not leave a bag in an accessible position. If your bag is snatched, immediately start shouting: the perpetrators rely on tourists reacting by silently trying to chase them without alerting the numerous police boxes. The thieves are often drug addicts.

Probably a bigger hazard than crime is the missing sewer covers on sidewalks. Additionally, there are many loose flagstones that will tip if stepped on. Tread carefully and exercise extreme caution at night.

 A“secret”Lao law says that foreigners cannot have sexual relations with Lao women other than their spouses. The penalty, if caught, is US$500 for first time, though as the text of the law is not available, may be much more (the US embassy says $5000); the foreigner may be jailed or deported and the Lao woman may find herself in jail–and that is really the last place anyone would want to be here. If you take a girl to your room and she robs you this law makes it almost impossible to obtain assistance from the police. Bar tenders are happy to provide stories of angry tourists confronting girls in the same bars they picked them up the night before! Anyway, many hotels do not allow foreigners to take girls to their rooms, as it is officially prohibited. Those that do allow it must have some financial arrangement with the local police–this is Laos where the only thing more powerful than the Law is money.

 Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam 
 Posted on December 24, 2008 by admin 
 Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnamese: Thành Phố Hồ Chí Minh ), commonly known as Saigon or by the abbreviation HCMC , is the largest city in Vietnam and the former capital of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).

 

Understand

Following the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City . However the old Saigon moniker is still used by both Vietnamese and foreigners, especially when referring to the most central part of the city, to which most tourists flock.

The helpful, Tourist Information Center (4G 4H Le Loi St, District 1. Tel (84-8) 822 6033) can be found on the northeast corner of the roundabout at the intersection of Le Loi and Nguyen Hue, right in the heart of the city. It’s a great place to pick up a free map (which includes a map of Hanoi, as well) and get an idea of what the city and surrounding area has to offer.

Get in

By plane

 Tan Son Nhat (Tân Sơn Nhất) (IATA: SGN | ICAO: VVTS ) is Vietnam’s largest international airport. There are two terminals: the new international terminal, which took over all international flights from September 2nd 2007, and the old terminal, which will be reserved for domestic traffic. Immigration is notoriously strict and can be time consuming, but if your papers are in order you should be fine. Note that the all-white departure cards are only for those without the‘yellow paper’received upon arrival. If you’ve lost your departure card or forgot to fill one out, the immigration officer may request $20 as a bribe to let you pass. Don’t give him the money–return to the front gate and fill out a new departure card. Remember that bribery is still a problem in this communist country.

The recently introduced No. 152 air-con airport bus is the cheapest way into the city, and will drop you off on the west side of the Pham Ngu Lao area, or at the bus terminal on the south side of the Ben Thanh Market roundabout. The price was recently increased to 3000 dong. Upon exiting the airport, turn right and walk towards the domestic airport, about 5 minutes walk, in front of the airport across a small road you will see the bus waiting there. Taxi drivers may tell you there are no more airport buses- ignore them.

Taxis from the airport to the city center would take as little as 15 minutes in lighter traffic (which only happens between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm). This should cost no more than 80,000VND. The more typical experience is to creep along in near-standstill traffic for 30 minutes or more, at a cost of about 120,000VND to 150,000VND from district 1, inclusive of airport tax. A company called Sasco has the airport taxi concession, and their cars are the first you will see by the curb. They are OK, just a bit more expensive than rivals such as Vinasun, Vinataxi, and Mai Linh, which can be found waiting in abundance 50 meters away, further out into the parking lot. Whichever taxi you choose, make sure the driver uses the meter. Major taxi companies are fairly honest, but if you want to avoid all stress, you could simply buy a“Taxi coupon”at one of the counter after the custom declaration&amp;x-ray at international airport terminal. The black VIP taxi (Vinasun, Mai Linh) will give you premium service with better Lexus car at higher rate. These maybe unnecessary expenses for a short trip to the hotel.

You can change money at the airport, usually just enough to pay for the taxi ride (US$10), but you’re probably better off paying for your first trip with US$ and exchanging in the city as the exchange in the airport may charge a commission as high as 3%. For simple calculation, taxi drivers&amp;street vendors usually take 1 USD = 17,000 VND.

Taxi drivers earn commission by taking customers to certain hotels, so be explicit about exactly which hotel you want to be taken to. Driver may come up with any kind of excuses, from“no vacancy”or“circus is in town”just to get you stay at other (commission paying) hotels.

Be specific which terminal you want to go to. International flights go from the newer international terminal (go straight); Domestic flights (to Hanoi, Danang, Nha Trang, etc) are from domestic terminal (turn left). Drop at the wrong terminal and you have to dash your way to the right terminal via pedestrian walkway link 600m away. Not recommended if you’re already late for boarding.

When entering the airport, taxi drivers will add the entry fee to your total meter. This is for the airport entry fee (5000 VND). Don’t confuse this entry fee with“Airport Departure Tax”as International Departure Taxes should have been included in the price of your flight ticket. In medium traffic from Ben Thanh Market to the airport, the total fare should be no more than 80,000VND as of October 2008 using the green and white metered taxis.

By bus

Bus travel is available from Phnom Penh via several different companies, at approximately $12 per person. Visas to Vietnam cannot be obtained at the border, so have one organised before arrival. Capital Tours operates a popular bus line from the Capital Guest House in Phnom Penh that takes passengers to the border, then after securing visas, passengers board a partner Vietnamese bus to continue travel to Ho Chi Minh.

The multitude of private tour company buses usually drop passengers off on Pham Ngu Lao just west of De Tham, giving easy access to accommodation in the backpacker area. Of course, this means that you’ll have at least 40-odd people shopping for the same rooms, which can be daunting as the nearby spots get snapped up. Patience will reward those who dig deeper into the tiny alleys, which have a (surprisingly safe) life of their own.

By train

The train station is located on Cach Mang Thang Tam (CMT8) Northwest of the city center, and is a short taxi or public bus ride away from the main hotel districts.

There is an official train ticket office in the backpackers district, located at 275C Pham Ngu Lao.

Get around

By taxi

Taxis are the most comfortable way of getting around, and not too expensive–about 15,000 dong for the first 1km, plus 11000 dong per additional km. (Prices jumped about 30% at the start of 2008, and again in July 2008 due to the soaring price of fuel.) It’s usually not hard to flag a taxi anywhere in the central city, though finding an available one in the rain or during peak hours can be difficult.

Taxi rates are not regulated by the city government, and each company sets its own fare structure, which changes from time to time. The market is fairly competitive, however, and the major companies all reasonably honest with similar rates. Major companies include: Vinasun (white), Mai Linh (various shades of white (standard), green (mini w/ cheaper rate), brown, and silver, Vinataxi (yellow), Petrolimex (white with blue and orange) and Savico (blue). Hoang Long (green and yellow) charges similar fares for short trips, but is 10-20% higher for long trips. Some off-brand taxis, such as“Taxi-Meter,”have fast meters, and are best avoided unless you are a regular and know them well. Drivers generally do not speak English or any other foreign language, so if your destination is somewhere other than the airport or a major hotel, it might help to write the name and/or address on paper beforehand.

Carry small change and bills for paying fares, since drivers are often short of change. Taxi models in service range from the tiny Daewoo Matiz to big Toyota Innova minivans. Newer cars are more likely to have working air-con; larger mini-SUV-type models sometimes charge a higher rate.

By motorbike

Traffic In Ho Chi Minh City

Motorbike taxis ( xe ôm , literally hug-vehicle) are plentiful (get used to hearing“you want moto!?”everywhere), cheap, and are generally quite safe. As of December 15th, 2007 all riders in Vietnam are now required to wear helmets an this is strongly enforced. As such, the driver should supply you with a helmet. If he doesn’t–find another one, as you’ll be the one stung for the fine. Absolutely agree on a price before you set off; short hops around town shouldn’t be more than 10000 dong, and all the way to the airport around 30000. Rule of thumb for the price will be nearest round up of half the cost of taxi ride for the same travel. Drivers are generally quite friendly and will go slower if requested. They’re also not adverse to a bear hug if you’re really struggling. Many of the moto drivers, especially in district 1 speak some English, and like many Vietnamese will repay you in a flood of smiles (and probably point out all the sights) if you make a little effort to get to know them.

You can rent your own motorbike in many places, especially around the backpacker area (Pham Ngu Lao) in District 1. Prices range from US$3-7/day; US$4 should get you a solid 100-110cc bike. Driving in Saigon is best left to experienced drivers, however–the traffic is intense, and has its own rhythms and logic. Drivers with limited experience should consider renting an automatic bike (usually a bit more expensive), as at busy crossroads there is not time for worrying about how to change gears. Beware of thieves: always keep your motorbike in sight or parked with an attendant. Most restaurants have guard / parking attendants out front who will issue you a numbered tag and take care of your motorbike. Independent parking lots are scattered around the sidewalks, alleys, and basements of the city – look for rows of neatly-parked motorbikes or signs that say giu xe . Prices range from free at some restaurants (though a small tip is common) to 5000 dong (~.30 US cents) at upscale night clubs.

By cyclo

For many reasons, not least because of government attempts to restrict cyclos on busy urban streets, cyclos are disappearing. At around US$2/hour and because they are so slow, they can be a good choice for taking in the city–however in areas popular with tourists, they often try to overcharge, so bargain beforehand. The price changes after your journey as finished, resulting in an embarrassing argument which soon becomes an intimidating atmosphere as other cyclo drivers appear as back up. So taking a cyclo is not really fun. The driver often visits places which benefit his wallet. The driver often ignores your directions for museums and heads to his favored local poor quality gift shop. They circulate around the central market and will immediately try to take you on a city tour the moment you are on board. Unless you fancy the novelty of a cyclo, a taxi will be quicker and just as cheap to anywhere you may want to go.

By bus

Look for the bright green buses with 150+ routes (Aug 2008)–maps of the bus system can be picked up across from Ben Thanh Market–just go into the waiting room to the desk in the middle. Cheap, safe and not too crowded either but only if you can find the right line. If you cannot find your way, ask the locals nicely, they will try their best to help. A piece of paper and marker pen may help to ease the conversation. Cheaper 2,000–4,000 dong and safer than many of the alternatives, the biggest problem is that when you get off the bus, you become a pedestrian (see below).

For those who aren’t staying in Ho Chi Minh City very long, or want to save his/her time, take a look on www.citylook.vn for the City Look Bus. It’ll take you to the famous places in Hochiminh city with the price from 15,000d to 75,000d, including the tour guide and the information in English.

On foot

Traffic is made up of a staggering number of motorbikes and, since import duty was reduced upon Vietnam’s joining of the WTO, an increasing number of private cars. However its exceptionally rare to see a motorbike of more than 150cc, and the traffic rarely gets above 20-30km/h in central areas.

However crossing the road in Saigon can be a nightmare. The first time may be a little scary, after that you will get used to it quite quickly. If ever in doubt, Saigon’s“Tourist Security”officers (guys in marked green uniforms) will happily help you across. A quicker way of getting across is to simply follow the lead of a local crossing the street.

However the true trick to crossing the road is to stay aware, and walk slowly and confidently. The motorbike riders are actually exceptionally good and will simply move to avoid you–just don’t make any sudden lurches forwards, backwards, or stop for that matter! Just look for a gap or seam in the traffic, and begin a slow but steady movement.

Adherence to traffic signals in Saigon is vastly improving, and while they’re not always followed, riders/drivers tend to use“best judgment”. Just remember though that vehicles can always turn right at any time (regardless of lights). Motorbikes often drive in the wrong direction (albeit quite safely and slowly) in unexpected places also. Crossing roads is therefore a challenge for Westerners used to traffic laws and traffic lights.

The streets, sidewalks, and outdoor markets are covered by motorbikes, and not yet geared towards pedestrian traffic (although sidewalk clearing campaigns are now underway- many areas of the center are easy to negotiate as long as you keep your wits about you for speeding motorbikes). However walking along the edge of the road is easy enough. Any motorbikes behind you will generally beep at you to let you know they’re there.

The traffic police occupy themselves with random roadside checks and do not bother the motorcyclists that are running red lights or driving on the sidewalks. The police recently announced a crackdown on pedestrians. This does NOT mean that they will hassle you; the most likely meaning of the crackdown is that you will be held responsible if you are involved in an accident.

But there are some open sidewalks to walk safely on and just walking around the city helps you really get a taste of it. Seeing people cook on the side of the street and just standing watching traffic go by in awe is just as entertaining as anything.

Maps

Most hotels will provide a free tourist map of district 1 although these vary in quality and tend to be advertising based. The Sheraton have one of the best of these and will provide one if you ask at reception. Within District 1,‘Bookazine’at #28 Dong Khoi (between Ngo Duc Ke and Ho Huan Nghiep) have larger city Maps if you plan to venture beyond District 1. The one published by Du Lich&amp;Giao Thong has a street index on the back. Fahasa Books also carry a full range of available Maps. They have two large stores in District 1–185 Dong Khoi, just down from Le Thanh Ton, and 40 Nguyen Hue, just down from Mac Thi Buoi. MySherpa Travel have also published tourist maps of central District 1 with all shops and points of interest marked. Outlets in Saigon include Gaya, Dolce Casa, Annam Fine Foods, T&amp;V Tailor, Galley Deli, and a number of two star hotels.

The tank that ended the war, outside the Reunification Palace

Last call for South Vietnam, Reunification Palace

 Reunification Palace, Enter at 135 Nam Ky Khoi Nghia Street, ☎ 9693272. Open daily 7:30AM-11:00AM, 1PM-4PM. Also known as Independence Palace (this is the old name). This is a restored five-floor time warp to the Sixties left largely untouched from the day before Saigon fell to the North (construction started in 1962 and finished in 1966). Formerly South Vietnam’s Presidential Palace, the war ended on April 30, 1975 when tank #843 — a replica of which is now parked on the lawn outside — crashed through the gate. Be sure to check out the impressively kitschy recreation room, featuring a circular sofa, and the eerie basement, full of vintage 1960s phones, radios, and office equipment, supposedly left exactly as it was found when the North took over. There is also a photo gallery and a propaganda film recounting how the South Vietnamese supporters and American imperialists succumbed to Ho Chi Minh’s indomitable revolutionary forces, upon which point the South Vietnamese supporters were forgiven and everyone lived happily ever after. Tours are available and are free, but not necessary. There is a nice outdoor café on the grounds outside the palace. Entry 15,000 dong.  edit 

 War Remnants Museum, 28 Vo Van Tan Street, ☎ 9302112, 9306325, 9305587 (warrmhcm@gmail.com). Open daily 7:30AM-12PM, 1:30PM-5PM, last admission 4:30PM. Formerly known as the of Exhibition House of American War Crimes, the museum was opened in a hurry, less than five months after the fall of the South. It’s currently housed in a rather confused assemblage of seven warehouses, with new purpose-built premises partially open for temporary and permanent exhibits. This disturbing display of man’s cruelty during the Vietnam (American) War includes halls full of gruesome photographs, a simulated“tiger cage”prison and jars of deformed fetuses blamed on Agent Orange. There is bias as there are no“records”of any unpleasant deeds having been committed by the North Vietnamese Army. Outside, there are helicopters, jets, tanks, and other bits of armament. However watch out for the amputees who will try and sell you their wares. It’s only a block from the Reunification Palace — see the museum pamphlet for a map. Entry 15,000 dong.  edit 

 On Le Quy Don , just south of the museum, is a 2000 dong/cone soft ice cream vendor, a happy treat in a hot and hectic city. 

 City Hall , end of Nguyen Hue Street. Originally called the Hôtel de Ville and now formally re-branded the People’s Committee Hall , it’s a striking cream and yellow French colonial building beautifully floodlit at night. No entry, but the statue of Uncle Ho in front is a very popular place for photos. 

 Museum of Vietnamese History, at the intersection of Le Duan Street and Nguyen Binh Khiem (just inside the zoo gates). The museum has a fine collection of Vietnamese antiquities, but unfortunately they are accompanied by signage which is both in poor English and full of risible Marxist distortions. Read up on Vietnamese history first or you’ll have no idea what you’re looking at. Outside, the Botanical Gardens are very nice and a good place for a cheap lunch away from the crowds. If you care about animal welfare, avoid the zoo.  edit 

 Ho-Chi-Minh Museum , Duong Nguyen Tat Thanh, Dist. 4, for your propaganda dose. Open daily 7:30AM-12:00PM, 1:30PM-5PM, last admission 4:30PM, 10,000 dong entry. The museum (in a French colonial era building) near the dock of Saigon shows the life story of the modern day father of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh (the guy on the money). There’s also a Ho Chi Minh book shop as well. 

Religious sites

 Notre Dame Cathedral (Nhà thờ Đức Bà), Han Thuyen Street, facing down Dong Khoi (next to the Post Office). Closes for lunch and on weekends. A French-built Catholic cathedral in the city center. Free entry.  edit 

There are several Chinese temples in Cholon , the Chinatown district of old Saigon. Only a few are listed here.

 Thien Hau Pagoda, 710 Nguyen Trai Street, Cholon. Dedicated to Lady Thien Hau, the sea goddess, who left two giant turtles to keep an eye on things in her absence. A festival is held in her honor on the 23rd day of the March lunar month. Don’t miss the gorgeous sculptures in the walls of the courtyard outside the temple. Entry free.  edit Quan Am Pagoda, 12 Lao Tu, Cholon (Just off Hung Vuong, close to Thien Hau Pagoda). Open 8AM-4:30PM. The oldest pagoda in town, home of a lot of incense and a cheerful puppy. Entry free.  edit Phung Son Tu Pagoda, 408 3 Thang 2 Blvd (On the outskirts of Cholon). Dedicated to the god of happiness and virtue. The pagoda itself is dusty and dwarfed by high-rises under construction nearby, but the small, sculpted grounds are a good place for a rest from the hectic city.  edit 

Do

If the heat starts to get you down, there are several water parks where you can splash around to cool off.

 Dam Sen Water Park, 03 Hoa Binh, Ward 3, District 11, ☎ 858.8418, 865.3453 (damsenwaterpark@vnn.vn, fax: 858.8419), [1]. Mon-Sat 8:30AM-6PM, Sundays and Holidays 8AM-7PM. Close to the city center. Opened in 1999, with new water slides added each year — this water park offers some truly unique water slide experiences (including the amazing“Space Bowl”)! You’d be a fool to resist. Restaurant, health services, and animatronic dinosaurs are on the premises. Do be careful though as the slides here tend to be much faster than those you may be more familiar with–basically follow the signs on the slides. Admission is height (and nationality) based; under 0.8m free, others 35-80,000 dong.  edit 

 Saigon Water Park, just north of the city in the Thu Duc District, has been demolished to make place for urban development, but there’s also Water World in District 9, Ocean Water Park in District 7, and Dai The Gioi Water Park in District 5. 

 The Saigon River . The park in front of the Renaissance Hotel offers nice views of the river. Make sure you know how to cross the road before attempting to get there. Expect to encounter some beggars in the park. 

Visiting hair salons is also a must do for tourists, as Vietnamese are famous for it. Hair wash, manicure and pedicure cost no more than US$10.

If you’re in Saigon on a Sunday night, then beg, borrow, or rent a two-wheeled vehicle and join the throngs for di choi . It’s basically a party on wheels, where everyone just rides through the downtown streets until the wee hours.

 Galaxy Cinema at 116, Nguyen Du, District 1, is a favorite among locals and bored tourists. They show up-to-date movies on the big screen. 

 Xuan Spa, Park Hyatt Saigon Hotel, 2 Lam Son Square, District 1, ☎ +84 8 824 1234 (saigon.park@hyattintl.com), [2].  edit 

Buy

Vietnamese arts and crafts, or mass-produced resin knock-offs thereof, are sold by dozens of shops around the central tourist district. The best, most expensive items can be mostly found on Dong Khoi or the immediate side streets; and the goods tend to get progressively simpler and cheaper as you move west toward Ben Than Market (though the best wood-carving shop is a stall on the back side of Ben Thanh). A few shops have authentic woven silk textiles from Sapa and the north. Lacquered paintings, plates, bowls, etc. are quite striking and unique to Vietnam. Vietnamese propaganda posters very impressive and offer a taste of history. When buying keep in mind that is very useful to have local currency (Dong).Be advised that Banks and formal exchange business will provide you with a decent rate (16000 dongs = 1 US$ dollar Jul 2008). However, agencies like Statravel on the main Vui Ban street will rip you off offering you 13000 if you are lucky.

Markets

 Chợ Bến Thành aka Ben Thanh Market , Southwest end of Le Loi, recognizable with its clock tower on the large traffic circle. The largest old-style market in the central district, with several hundred small stalls stuffed with goods on almost impassably narrow aisles. Due to its popularity with tourists, the market is now divided about half and half between tourist goods (jeans, T-shirts, smaller souvenirs in abundance) and the stuff of regular life (fruit and vegetables, rice, kitchen wares, flowers, meat, fast food, and local-style pickled fruits and candies). Most items are not price-marked, and vendors always quote a 50-100% higher price to tourists vs. locals, so the fortitude to haggle will save you some money. (There is some talk of‘fixed’prices are being introduced, though if you are polite, and don’t offend the vendor’s pride, and are willing to walk away, no price is truly fixed). If the good selection of knock-offs here just won’t do, there’s plenty to be had in the surrounding side street shops or night market later. *insider tip* if possible, take your own bag when shopping. vendors have been known to give out different colored bags to indicate if you are a sucker, or a hard bargainer. 

 Chợ Bình Tây in the Chinatown, the more underrated twin of Ben Thanh, selling everything from spices, Chinese medicines, silk to obscure varieties of fermented fish, dried seafoods and jerks. If you are searching for varieties of Vietnam silks and velvets, skip the tourist trap Ben Thanh Market, head for Binh Tay and your choice is endless. 

 Night Market ( just outside of Ben Thanh Market ). Here you can enjoy many kinds of different food and drink, and go round to do your shopping as well. Open from 5:00pm (when the Ben Thanh Market closes). 

 War Surplus Market , sometimes called the American Market or“Cho Cu”or“Khu Dan Sinh”in corner of Yersin and Nguyen Cong Tru, district 1. Hidden behind rows of hardware and electric supplies shops, just brave yourself and enter in. Dense warrens of stalls with old American military gear of indeterminate authenticity (e.g.“nice collection of so called authentic GI’s Zippo lighter from the war era”), cheap t-shirts, and military paraphernalia. Don’t hope to find a genuine Marine zippo, honestly, they’re all fake now. 

Supermarkets and department stores

 Tax Department Store , corner of Le Loi and Nguyen Hue. Formerly the Russian Market, this is now a rather sterile department store of sorts filled with stalls selling touristy kitsch, although the selections get better as you ascend the levels. There’s a good supermarket on level 2. If you are traveling here by taxi, the new name may be met by blank expressions from taxi drivers. The old name seems to work. 

 Small western-style supermarkets , can be found in the Saigon Center, corner of Pasteur and Le Loi; on the top floor of the Parkson department store one block northeast of the Opera House, and in Diamond Plaza, behind the Cathedral, on the top floor of the department store. 

 Co-op Mart Supermarkets , frequented by throngs of the Saigon middle-class and backpackers alike, can be found everywhere around HCMC. In district 1 they can be found at the corner of Nam Ky Khoi Nghia and Nguyen Dinh Chieu, about 1 km from the center OR in Cong Quynh, walking distance away from the end of Backpacker street Pham Ngu Lao. Prices are reasonably lower, though the selection leans more toward Vietnamese culinary requirements. 

 Three western/Japanese-style department stores exist near the center: Parkson on Dong Khoi a block north of the Opera house; Diamond Plaza, further north behind the Notre Dame Cathedral; and Zen Plaza on Nguyen Trai two blocks west of the New World Hotel. For most visitors, the only reason to go there is to enjoy the air-con, and derive some amusement from the silly-high prices of western-branded consumer goods. 

Souvenirs

 Phuong Mai Art Gallery, 129 B Le Thanh Ton St., Dist.1 (near the Norfolk Hotel and the Revolution Museum). A gallery showing contemporary Vietnamese artists, both established and emerging. There’s another showroom at 213C Dong Khoi in Dist. 1.  edit 

 Oil-Painting–Bui Vien Street , near backpackers area in De Tham and Pham Ngu Lao streets, in District 1. There are several shops along this street selling oil painting at reasonable prices (ranging from US$25-300). If you like a portrait of Vietnamese paintings or even have your own photographs oil-painted, shop around here. You can get a readily available portrait within a day or two. 

Others

 Electronics Just a warning for others, whilst some of the country’s cheapest electronics can be found on and around Huynh Thuc Khang, be aware most shops are selling counterfeit items. Things such as dodgy iPods are easy to spot when compared to the genuine thing, but items such as camera batteries are much more difficult. If you are thinking about buying some extra memory for your digital camera, be warned that most of the memory will be fake. Fake Sandisk II Ultra cards are ubiquitous and extremely difficult to tell apart from real ones. These cards are apparently of low quality and one has to ask if it is worth risking your holiday snaps. It is probably worth mentioning that fake batteries have the potential to explode, too, so be careful. You might even be better off buying this stuff from home. That said, you can pick up some bargains if you know what you’re looking for. Just exercise caution; if it is too good to be true and so forth. 

 Lacquer ware One of the stand out things to bring home from Saigon. Head to Saigon Craft (between Mac Thi Buoi and Dong Du on Dong Khoi) for stunning original works, then Gift 42 (opposite Lucky Plaza on Dong Khoi) for the best of the rest. 

 Home Decor Originality and value. If you’re thinking of investing $2,000 or more on home furnishing, a crate shipped from Saigon could pay for your trip. Begin by looking for major items in Gaya (Ton That Thiep just before Pasteur) if you like modern, and Verlim (40 Ho Tung Mao–just up from Ham Nghi), if your style is more formal/traditional. Organize shipping through either of these fine merchants. Then you can go wild and buy up…framed art, Gom Viet pottery (Cnr Ly Tu Trong and Pasteur), Lighting from NGA (Le Thanh Ton between Nguyen Hue and Dong Khoi) or Mosaic (Mac Thi Buoi just before Nguyen Hue) and antiques found on Le Cong Kieu. Provide extra padding for your crate with Catherine Denoual bed ware (Thi Sach, just down from Le Thanh Ton), and/or Dolce Casa cushions/quilts (Dong Khoi opposite the Sheraton). Ask these and other retailers to deliver your purchases back to Gaya or Verlim. They take care of the rest. 

 Clothes Vietnamese silk is fabulous and Hoang Khai shows the world. His flagship Khai Silk store at 107 Dong Khoi is a must visit. Next door, Creation and Indochina provide sterling competition. Ladies, you are spoiled for choice after this. Follow your nose, but make sure you don’t miss La Bella, La Bella Blue (Pasteur and Le Thanh Ton), Song (Dong Khoi and Le Thanh Ton and in Eden Mall on Dong Khoi), and acclaimed designer Minh Hanh (Just up from Dong Khoi and Ngo Duc Ke). Look out for exquisite hand embroidered items along the way. 

 Accessories At Gaya you’ll spot Anupa bags and you’ll want one. Those not loaded should avoid sticker shock and (ladies) head immediately to Ipa Nima (cnr Pasteur and Le Thanh Ton) for a stunning and more affordable collection. Press on to Mandarina (Le Than Ton just past NKKN) for bargain shoes and Le Hang (Le Thanh Ton between Pasteur and NKKN) for bead/bespoke jewelery nirvana. 

 Kids presents Musical stuff from Chuck and Anna (Lucky Plaza–bottom of Dong Khoi) will hit the spot. DVD buffs with no scruples should head to Ho Tung Mao Romance Candles, oils and soaps from Harnn (Dong Du near Hai Bai Trung) Books Fahasa English Bookstore (Dong Khoi cnr Le Thanh Ton and Nguyen Hue just down from Mac Thi Buoi). For Men/Tailors Khai Silk and Creation have very desirable shirts at around $30, and ties to compete with your Zegnas for $10. Off the peg shirts can be tailored for you at no charge. Otherwise, take your favourite shirts/shorts/pants to Tricia and Verona (half way up Dong Du), who’ll make you up a perfect copy in silk, linen or finest Egyptian cotton. Allow two days. $25–$50. Here for five days? You have time for a suit. For quality work from old boys who know their cloth–Cao Minh (Pasteur between Le Thanh Ton and Le Loi). Want to go where old money/ex pats go? Minh Doan (Le Thanh Ton just down from Nguyen Trung Truc) is your pick. 

 Art Vietnamese artists are increasing their international reputation. Sell some stock and invest in something yielding a daily return from your walls. Consider your investment in Apricot (Mac Thi Buoi), Mai’s (Nguyen Hue just up from Mac Thi Buoi), Hanoi Studio (Dong Du), or Tu Do ((Ho Tung Mau). Eat and contemplate in Gallery Deli (Dong Khoi just down from Mac Thi Buoi). Listen and contemplate in Sax ‘n Art Le Loi and Pasteur). Bargain frames – Ben Thanh Art and Frame (11 Le Thanh Ton–100 north from Thai Van Lung). 

 Bicycle Shops are most frequent along Vo Thi Sau. The biggest one–actually 6 shops next to each other–is Martin at 93-107 Vo Thi Sau and has the best selection of bikes. They also sell spare parts for western-style mountain bikes. 

There are two good guide books for shoppers in Ho Chi Minh City: the Luxe city guide and the MySherpa guide which also includes a map with shops cross referenced.

Eat

You’re spoiled for choice in Saigon, which offers the country’s largest variety of Vietnamese and international food. Bargains are getting harder to find, however, and restaurant prices have been rising at up to 30% per year due to a combination of higher food prices, rising wages, and soaring real estate costs. Land in the city center now sells for around US$16,000 per square meter, so even a modest-sized restaurant sits on real estate worth more than US$1 million. Authentic local food at bargain prices is one of the glories of Vietnam, but it’s getting harder to find in Saigon as the city becomes ever more upscale and cosmopolitan.

Budget

Food stalls are scattered all over the city, but there’s a fair collection in the Ben Thanh market (see Buy). For local fast food, try the ubiquitous Pho 24 chain.

Along Pham Ngu Lao there are many budget Westernised options, and venturing a bit further into the side alleys can uncover some better choices than on the main streets.

 Dong Ba , 110A Nguyen Du, Dist 1. This is a shop that sells Hue Food including Hue beef noodles and traditional banh beo rice cakes. 

 Faifo , on an alley off Huynh Tinh Cua, almost to Ly Chinh Thang, about 2km from the center in Q3. A family-run restaurant featuring central-Vietnamese dishes at modest prices—a combination of value and authenticity not to be found directly in the tourist district. Dinner for two with beer or juice runs about 130,000 dong. It’s becoming so popular, getting a table is sometimes difficult. 

 Pho Bo Vien Quoc Ky , 52 Ngo Duc Ke ( near Nguyen Hué, District 1 ). A nice and cheap place for a soup. Try the sate version of the usual Pho or My: a spicy delicacy! 

 Doner Kebab , 198 Bui Vien st., District 1. Inside the backpacker area, you could easily find this small hawk. 15,000d for each Turkish Kebab. 

 Dream Cones , 16 Nguyen Thi Nghia St., Ben Thanh Ward, Dist. 1. What a great respite in such a hot and heaving city. Gelato ice cream for less than 16,000 dong a scoop. Nice quirky and cool neon atmosphere, with lots of white leather seating. Free unlimited (unsweetened) iced tea served with your ice cream they pour at your table. 

 Falafellim , 97 Pham Ngu Lao St., District 1. Homemade falafel, tahini and hummus in soft pita bread pockets. Eat in, take away or delivered to your hotel–call 08-915-1733. Free 5 min international calls to limited destinations. 

 Pho 24 , Clean modern chain found everywhere in Ho Chi Minh City. Excellent beef noodle soup, very cheap. 

 BanhMiBistro , 76 Vo Thi Sau, District 1, across from Le Van Tam park. Great fresh gourmet sandwiches, especially the famous Vietnamese“Banh Mi”. Bread is baked fresh in the store. There are 3 other outlets around town including one across from the airport in the Parkson CT Plaza. 

Mid-range

 Barbecue Garden , 135A Nam Ky Khoi Nghia–Quan 1. HCMC Phone 8233340. Located 100 meters from Benh Thanh Market. [3]. US$5-7 range. The restaurant is a barbecue specialist with both Vietnamese and International delicous recipes. At night, the garden is full of odors, of ambiance and music with guests sharing cheerfully the barbecue preparation. The restaurant is an amazing place to have diner but also to take a drink (free wifi) when during the day you want, for a moment, to forget about the city. 

 Chi Nghia , 53 Thu Khoa Huan, near Ben Thanh market, [4]. Small place specializing in Northern style Vietnamese cuisine. It’s run by the chef/owner, who has 25 years of experience with Sofitel hotels, so her cooking and presentation is five star quality, but the prices are definitely reasonable. Entrees are US$2-5. Very clean, and nicely decorated. 

 Hoa Mai Coffee #43-45 Do Quang Dau Street #(08)-836-8310. Located in a fun, up and coming area, just off Phan Ngu Lao, between Phan Ngu Lao Street and Bui Vien Street. Restaurant downstairs has nice, relaxed atmosphere, and on the second floor is a comfortable bar with pool table. Reasonable prices and lots of international food and local dishes to choose from. Around US$2-5. Fresh fruit shakes, spring rolls, vietnamese noodles and pasta are recommended. 

 Huong Dong , which recently moved a bit further from the center, to 68 Huynh Tinh Cua. A modest, open-air restaurant with bamboo furniture, serving mostly southern country-style food. The name literally means“scent of the fields”. It’s a place where families and groups of friends gather, drink a lot of beer, eat a lot of food, and make a bit of noise. You might need a few beers to get up the courage to try some of the more exotic offerings, including field mouse, whole frog, pigeon porridge, and coconut worm. A whole char-grilled ga ta (local style free-range chicken) is 120,000 dong, head and feet included. A wide variety of other meats and seafood is available for 50,000–80,000 dong. Quirkly English translations of the long menu add to the spirit of adventure. 

 LA SEN Restaurant ( Nha Hang LA SEN ), 30 Ba Huyen Thanh Quan, Phuong 6–Quan 3. Phone 9306682 (+84 8 9306682). Opening hours 9:30AM-11PM. Very nice and clean medium-priced restaurant serving delicious food from the regions (Hue, Saigon and Hanoi) of Vietnam just in the center of district 3. Friendly service, fully air-conditioned, two floors and with room for about 100 persons. 

 Lemongrass , 4 Nguyen Thiep Street. A very touristy Vietnamese restaurant. Most dishes are in US$4-6 range, although some seafood items are expensive; try the daily business lunch at US$3++ and weekly special dishes. 

 Luong Son Quan , 31 Ly Tu Trong. Great barbecue restaurant with a broad choice of meats: beef, chicken, kangaroo, ostrich, etc, seafood and specialties: frog legs, scorpion, snake, etc. Menu in Vietnamese and English, rate is very good (US$5-10 per person) for such quality. Note that Vietnamese generally enjoy barbecue with local beer (Larue, 333, Saigon). 

 Ngoc Suong Marina ,19C Le Quy Don, is a restaurant specializing in seafood. Try the fish salad and the clams cooked in white wine. 

 Quan An Ngon , 138 Nam Ky Khoi Nghia Street. A large and busy Vietnamese chain restaurant featuring regional specialties from around the country in the US$3-5 range. Rather than once central kitchen, the place has a row of independently-operated food stalls around the perimeter. (The name literally means“restaurant of delicious eating”.) It’s set in an atmospheric old French villa across the street from the Reunification Palace. Food can be good although some dishes lack finesse. 

 Quan Nuong , 29-31 Ton That Thiep. A delicious, reasonably-priced open-air barbecue restaurant on the roof above Fanny’s ice cream parlor and the Temple Club (see splurges below). Every table has a grill in the center, and the menu includes a variety of meats and seafood which you can grill yourself. Try the bacon wrapped salmon&amp;the beef wrapped cheese skewers. They also serve a variety of mostly southern-style salads and noodle dishes. It’s very popular and often fills up by mid-evening. 

 Sushi Bar , with two locations: corner of Le Thanh Ton and Ton Duc Thang in Q1, about six blocks northeast of the Opera House; and on the food-court floor of Zen Plaza on Nguyen Trai. Probably the best sushi value in Saigon. They serve a larger and more interesting variety than the typical American or European sushi restaurant, at half the price. Draft Tiger beer is 24,000 dong. Very popular, so you can expect to wait during the middle dining hours. 

 Spice , 27c Le Quy Don in Q3. Largest and most visited Thai restaurant in HCM. Mostly local Vietnamese and expats as it is out of the tourist area. Authentic Thai food prepared by the two Thai chefs. Food is served within minutes and thank to a high turnover of clients, it’s always very fresh. In addition to a large selection of classics like Tom Yam Kung and Papaya Salad, try the specialties like Spice Shrimp or Bangkok Briany: fusion of Thai with other cuisines. Seating over 200, in a/c, al fresco or Thai style on floor mats. Nice choice for small parites and catering. Delivery available to all districts. New in Spice: top floor BBQ. 

 Wrap and Roll , 62 Hai Ba Trung. A growing chain. Serves up delicious wrapped Vietnamese fusion food in a modern minimalist setting. Try the desserts. Beer and a meal should cost less than US$10. 

 The City Diner . Authentic 1950s style American Diner with 2 locations. 110 Ho Tung Mau, District 1, and 91 Nguyen Huu Canh, The Manor, Binh Thanh. Great Burgers, Salads, Sandwiches and more. A fun atmosphere, bottomless cup of coffee, free wi-fi and reasonably priced food make this restaurant a favorite of locals, expats and visitors alike. Ho tung Mau location open till late. Delivery available. 

Splurge

 Au Lac do Brazil , 238 Pasteur, between Dien Bien Phu and Vo Thi Sau. Just to prove that Saigon has everything, here is a Brazilian-style churrascaria (all-you-can-eat restaurant featuring barbecued meat), with live Latin music Tuesday to Saturday. They also have a new outlet in Sky Garden II. Phu My Hung. Dist 7. It’s a larger and less crowded one with usually better service 

 Co Ngu , on Pasteur just before Dien Bien Phu, Q1. Nice Vietnamese and Asian-fusion food in a Villa setting, with indoor and garden seating. Popular for business groups. Prices higher than average for Saigon, but a better value than you will find in the tourist section of town. 

 La Habana , 6 Cao Ba Quat, Q1, two blocks northeast of the Hyatt and opera house. Outstanding Spanish and Cuban-style food, including a large tapas menu. Also one of the few places in Vietnam that makes really good cocktails. 

 La Hosteria , on Le Thanh Ton a few blocks east of the Hilton. A gourmet Italian restaurant with excellent home-made pasta dishes in the range of 125,000 dong and main dishes 150,000+. 

 L’En tete , 1st floor, 139 Nguyen Thai Binh, Q.1 ( at the junction with Calmette ). Excellent French restaurant in a area not normally associated with high dining. Great for a leisurely dining experience, good food with main courses ranging from 150000-450000 dong. Open 17:00-midnight, 

 Pomodoro’s , Decent small Italian restaurant on Hai Ba Trung, a block from the Hilton and around the corner from the Sheraton. Delicious lasagna is their specialty; the pizzas are a bit oily but OK. Prices are reasonable compared to the USA or Europe, with a nice dinner of 2 starters, cocktails, .5 litre carafe of wine, mains and deserts all for roughly US$50. 

 The Sheraton on Dong Khoi has a magnificent, though expensive (US$40-ish) all you can eat buffet dinner. 

 Tân Nam , 60-62 Dong Du, Q.1 ( a few doors down from Sheraton Saigon ). The ground floor is open-air, the upper floor is air-con. Rather expensive and mediocre food, around US$10/person but they will park your motorcycle while you eat, and wander around the waterfront. 

 Temple Club , 29-31 Ton That Thiep, Q.1 ( first floor, with an ice cream parlour below ) has a 1930′s ambiance with separate bar, restaurant, and lounge area sections. The food is fair but most people come to soak up the atmosphere. 

Drink

Coffee shops

Vietnam is the worlds second largest exporter of coffee behind Brazil, and cà phê is very popular among the Vietnamese. It’s a paradise for coffee-loving visitors. The local style is strong and sweet; key words to remember are: sữa (sweetened condensed milk), đá (ice), and nóng (hot, pronounced“nowm”). Cà phê đá is strong, sweet iced coffee; and cà phê sữa đá is the same with condensed milk. Cà phê (sữa) nóng is brewed fresh on your table brewed in a little metal apparatus placed over a cup; just lift it off when it has cooled enough to touch (and hence drink). Prices range from 10,000 to 20,000 dong for coffee in the local style.

Since ice might or might not be made with purified water, strictly cautious visitors should avoid it, though long-term residents consume ice from reputable cafes and restaurants all the time.

Espresso, cappuccino, and American-style filter coffee are now also widely available in the tourist district, usually at twice the price of the local style.

 Cafe 5 Sao Near the Turtle Pond, on Pham Ngoc Thach. Plays loud techno music. Attractive but pretentious crowd. 

 Bobby Brewery Coffee , on Bui Vien st., opened and operated by an American guy who is used to offering money for the charity. It’s a nice place with good beverage. Used to show the movies on 2nd and 3rd floor. 

 La Fenêtre Soleil 2nd floor on the corner of Le Thanh Ton and Nam Ky Khoi Nghia. Save the world from pint size caramel Lattes. Brave the decrepit stairway and enter an oasis. 

 Gloria Jeans Cnr Dong Khoi and Nguyen Thiep (opposite the Sheraton). Popular Starbucks-style chain. 

 Kem Café Nearest place for many in downtown D1 to go with a local. Pull up a plastic chair and sit on the pavement. A table will appear. Practice“Cà phê đá”or“Cà phê sữa da”. If you want hot then attempt“nowm”but don’t expect to be understood. Point. 

 Chot Nho Café 189, Nguyen Van Troi, Phu Nhuan District. Reasonable price, good menu. 10 minutes by taxi from main city center. free Wi-Fi. 

 Cine Café 116 Nguyen Du, inside the Galaxy Cinema complex. Quiet ambiance with views of the park. 

 Givral Café , Dong Khoi ( opposite Continental Hotel ). More in the French tradition, with fresh pastries, collared waiters and elaborate portions of ice cream. Well located, but over 20000 dong for the simplest cup. 

 Hideaway Café , 41/1 Pham Ngoc Thach, Q.3–as its name implies, this place is hidden away and a good place to read, or have a quiet conversation or meal. Decent Western menu, although slightly pricey, is good. Free Wi-Fi. 

 Highlands Coffee is an upscale, somewhat pricey chain serving Western-style as well as local-style brews in prime locations around the tourist district. They also serve food and pastries. Cappuccino costs above 30,000 dong, approaching prices in the west, but the quality is disappointing. 

 M-Comic 99B vo thi sau a, a rather hard to find coffee shop. Upstairs is like a bedroom with a couple of beds–arrive early if you want to occupy one. It has large selection of magazine and comic book to chose from. The price is fairly cheap, ranging from 11,000 to 30,000 dong. But only serves Vietnamese drinks, and the staff barely speak English. Has free Wi-Fi. 

 Cafe Napoly on Pham Ngoc Thach near the Turtle Pond. The decor is Roman-ruin-lite (they meant“Napoli”) but the menu is typical for an upscale Vietnamese cafe—coffee, fruit drinks, ice cream, and a simple food menu including eggs and rice dishes. Piped music is nice, not too loud by day (though louder at night), prices are decent. Has three parts: an outdoor terrace in front, air-con section on the ground floor, and evening time lounge-bar on the upper floor. Next door to the louder, more trendy / pretentious Cafe Nam Sao. 

 Poppy Café 217 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, D3, [5]. Modern lounge café where the specialty is fruit-topped natural frozen yogurt. The only café in SG that serves this refreshing healthy treat. Creative fruit smoothies and light Vietnamese + Western fares also on menu. Free Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs, and English-speaking staff. 

 Sozo has two locations, including one in Pham Ngu Lao. Prices are reasonable, Wi-Fi is free, and all proceeds benefit needy Vietnamese families. Good drinks, friendly staff, but their coookies could be better if they were baked in a real oven. 

 Trung Nguyen , [6]. The Vietnamese version of Starbucks, but with much better coffee. They have locations all over the city, but are not well represented in the heart of the tourist district. Figure on 10000 dong for a basic cuppa, although there are plenty of variations including the infamous weasel coffee (cà phê chồn), made from coffee beans collected from civet excrement. Two convenient outlets are east side of Nguyen Hue right before City Hall, and corner of Thu Khoa Huan and Ly Tu Trong. 

 Regina Cofee 84 Nguyen Du Street, District 1, HCM City. It’s a great place to get a good cup of Vietnamese coffe or even American style cappuccino. They have an extremely skilled Japanese expresso master who knows how to brew coffee. The place has sort of a French mixed with Asian design with bricks covering all the walls. It’s marketed towards tourists but it’s a good place for expats with it’s good coffee. All proceeds go to the church just around the corner. 

 Windows Cafe Near the Reunification Palace. This is a pen for Vietnam’s fashion slaves and seems to be THE place to be seen. Pretentious atmosphere, good menu, always packed. 

Bars and clubs

Saigon has plenty of places to drink, although to a certain degree Vietnamese and foreigners hang out in different places; however this is slowly changing as Westerners become more familiar with the ways of the East (and vica versa). Places with live music usually have no cover charge, but impose somewhat elevated drink prices (typically 55,000–85,000 for beer, spirits, and cocktails.) Saigon is an early-to-bed town, and most places close at midnight.

Where you can find tourists

 163 Cyclo Bar , 163 Pham Ngu Lao Street, 2 doors down from the Duna Hotel. Thumping music until 2 a.m. and really friendly staff. The Vietnamese girls seem to have a strong affinity for Caucasian men. 

 Allez Boo , corner Pham Ngu Lao, De Tham. The definitive backpacker bar has closed and been replaced by a Highlands Coffee outlet.…but it re-opened across the street in mid-August 2008! It’s still shiny and brand-new, but retains the traditional sidewalk tables. There’s an air-conditioned bar on the second floor with DJ-type music, and an airy rooftop patio. Quite similar to its sibling establishment, Go2 Bar. 

 Apocalypse Now , 2C Thi Sach. Legendary and still packed on weekends, although aside from a few movie references it’s not all that much to look at. Stays open late. Now opened their 2nd floor for dj, dancing, drinks with less crowded atmosphere. Cover charge of 150000 VND (9 USD) for locals (and those of Asian appearance), almost always waived for foreigners and anyone fashionably dressed. 

 Alibi , 11 Thai Van Lung. Very cozy atmosphere, with sofas lining the walls and beautiful decor. good food&amp;drinks selection, nice music, and a mix of both local&amp;expat people. friendly staff, and the management’s always there to make you feel welcome and make sure you get what you are asking for. 

 Catwalk , at the side of New World Hotel. All in one place with a massage parlour, disco, KTV and a mini casino. Price is on the expensive side but it is a sight to behold. (Please note that if you want to occupy a room @ KTV, the minimum purchase is USD200.) 

 Eden , De Tham Street. Often busy, full of sporties, revellers, expats and others. Dark and deep and reasonably priced for the backpacker main drag. 

 Go2 Bar , corner De Tham and Bui Vien. The main backpacker bar while Allez Boo was closed, still a great meeting place, as it’s impossible to miss the four floors of neon lights on the outside. Large patio on the sidewalk at street level, a cozier bar on the second floor with occasional live music or big-screen sports, plus a rooftop patio (with retractable roof!) with individual BBQs up a steep set of stairs on the fifth floor. Open very late most nights, all night on weekends. 

 Rex Hotel rooftop , corner of Nguyen Hue and Le Loi. They serve a buffet dinner at the dinner hour, which gradually gives way to drinks and music. Acts change over time, but recently included a Filipino band playing FM classics and a Vietnamese group playing Latin and flamenco. It’s a pleasant place to get above the city noise and enjoy some fresh air. In years past, it was also a good value, but recent aggressive price increases have put it into the expense-account-only catetory: cocktails around 140,000 dong (including the ++, which hotels always add). 

 Level 23 , Sheraton Saigon 23F. The latest on the 5-star hotel drinking scene, with separate bar and nightclub, and great views over the city. A little soulless though, and very pricey with most drinks 80000 dong. 

 Le Pub , 175/22 Pham Ngu Lao, located on the small road which connects Pham Ngu Lao and Bui Vien. Always be busy after 6PM, so famous for its great music, foods and beverage. It has the same owner with Le Pub in Hanoi, of course, the same high quality service! 

 Oblivion , Bui Vien. Late night venue with lots of character, claims to be Saigon’s premier music bar and it’s hard to argue–assuming, that is, you have a taste for non-chart buzzy British guitar and obscure dark US/European stuff. You have to ask for happy pop, though if you’re spending enough it’ll sometimes get an outing. Like most Saigon bars, it attracts its share of working girls. If you’re not interested, simply say you’re not and you’ll be left alone. 

 Saigon Saigon , Caravelle Hotel 9F, 12-13 Lam Son Square. A pleasant, breezy bar with a great view of the city. Live band playing inside every night. Cool, quiet ambience on the terrace. Attracts an expense-account crowd due to the prices (cocktails mostly&gt;100,000 dong including the ++). 

 Shadow Bar , 41 Dong Du Street. Expat bar, good place to wind down or up. Recently renovated as an upmarket bar and restaurant under the new name of ZanziBar. Excellent menu, wine selection and imported beers along with a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. 

 Sheridan’s , Le Thanh Ton near Thai Van Lung. Small, cozy Irish-themed bar with imported draft beer and live music. 

 Underground –more a food than a drink spot, though open for both. Sometimes busy with the business crowd, always packed with people enjoying the reasonably priced burgers, steaks and the like. 

Where you can see the locals

 Lush , at the far west end of Ly Tu Trong. A nightclub in the Western style, with loud pulsing music and minimalist too-cool decor. Hugely expensive, but musically about as good as it gets in this part of the world if you like the particular style. Mixed crowd (Vietnamese, tourists and expats), pretty good food–but no dance floor. Lots of billiards/pool tables out back. 

 Q Bar Saigon The original, internationally acclaimed Q Bar established in 1992 under the Opera House. Mix of locals, tourists and expats in a grotto-like uber-chic setting that could as easily be in Soho as Saigon. Open till late every night. Great cocktails, though at very high prices, similar to the roof-top bar of the Caravelle Hotel across the street. It’s the cool place to be seen if you have a lot of Uncle Hos in your pocket. Terrace and Indoor areas. DJ nights. 

 Xu Bar , Hai Ba Trung street, near the Opera house. Great wine list. Nice ambiance&amp;service. Not a club. 

 Velvet , Ho Huan Nghiep/ Dong Khoi corner. Nice ambiance&amp;music. Latest chic bar in town. 

 Bounce Club , on top of Parkson on Le Thanh Ton street. Very crowded with locals in the weekends. Large dance floor, great hip hop music, somewhat too crowded. 

 Acoustic Cafe , 6E1 Ngô Thời Nhiệm. Though only 1 km from the heavily touristed center, this club is completely outside the tourist orbit, and offers an interesting view of local life. The all-Vietnamese house band performs every night, mostly American music, and it’s always jammed with student-aged groupies. For some reason, they address the crowd in English between songs, even though half the crowd doesn’t understand. On weekends, at least, you need to arrive by 7:30 to have any hope of getting a seat. If your hobby is rock ballad or hardrock, you should go on Friday night 

 Carmen , 8 Ly Tu Trong, former home of an unbelievably talented Salsa / Flamenco / Latin pop band, was unfortunately leveled in August, 2007 when the owner of part of the underlying land decided to sell. The owner of the club struggled with efforts to rebuild, and it appears now that Carmen will never be again. 

 Ice Blue , Dong Khoi. Downtown English pub, complete with darts board and warm beer (if you want it that way!). Friendly, but shuts at midnight. 

 Juice , claims to be Saigon’s first juice bar (of course it wasn’t, there were many local places before–but maybe it was the first Western-managed one). Food slipped recently, but still a nice place to hang out. Has Wi-Fi. 

 Khong Ten , (literally“No Name”), 147 Hai Ba Trung, is a large cabaret featuring some of the biggest Vietnamese celebrity singers still in Vietnam. The headliner is often familiar to the locals from television. Most overseas visitors would not like the musical style very much (mostly the mellow-to-melancholy, soft-jazzy, love-ballady style favored by the middle and older generation of Vietnamese.) But it’s pure Vietnam and very popular with HCMC residents and Vietnamese expats on trips home. The cover charge is about the highest in town at 150,000 dong. 

 La Habana , 6 Cao Ba Quat, about two blocks north of the Hyatt. A restaurant and bar with Cuban theme that makes outstanding cocktails for 60,000 dong. Some are available in pitcher-size for 150,000 to 180,000 dong. The food is also excellent, though at the high end of Saigon prices. Their Friday night live music headliner, Jeram, has returned from Ireland, and it’s usually standing-room only. 

 Lion’s , 11-13 Lam Son Square, Dist.1 (next to Caravelle hostel). Brewery–Restaurant (somewhat German food), with tasty beers at an affordable price. The outside terrace is a nice place to chill out, and the inside restaurant is very welcoming with its two beer tanks and cosy bar. Cocktails are very good. Not a good place to please your teeth and tongue. though. 

 Metallic Bar , 41 Ba Huyen Thanh Quan, District 3. House band plays covers of Metallica, Guns N Roses and other popular rock bands nightly between 9PM and midnight. 

 Napoly , Pham Ngoc Thach near the“Turtle Pond”. The ground floor is a popular, somewhat upscale cafe with inside and outside seating. The bar is upstairs in the back, with a decent house band singing a mixture of Vietnamese and English songs. The resident band must predate the reunification as they know all the old songs. 

 Peaches Saigon South (Phu My Hung). Great place to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Friendly staff, great Asian food!! 

 Polo , Ham Nghi Street ( above the Liberty Hotel ). Mixture of expats and locals, starts getting busy quite early. Reasonably priced food and drink, good music spanning from the Eighties to the present. 

 Rio Saigon , A brazilian flowery decor-themed bar/pub with a great Fillipino house band playing Pop/Rock (Bon Jovi, Skid Row fare). This joint was apparently the original“17 Saloon”bar (now at Pham Ngu Lao) when it was still located along the Saigon River. Great service staff and excellent atmosphere. It is situated at 131 Ton That Dam St. (District 1), Tel: (08)8211827–8211812. You will be surprised that its located somewhere within a wet street market. Gets crowded around 9 pm and closes at midnight. 

 Saigon Pho , this little hole in the wall is only a stone’s throw from Allez Boo, but much more expat orientated. Open late. 

 Serenata and Soi Da , 6E Ngô Thời Nhiệm. Two open-air cafe-bars with live music in Villa-style settings, which attract few if any tourists but typify what most Vietnamese consider a pleasant evening out. Both feature a mix of classical chamber music, Vietnamese lounge songs, American FM classics, and the odd French song. 

 The Tavern SB8-1 My Khanh 2 (H4-2) Nguyen Van Linh, Saigon South (Phu My Hung) tel: 4120866. Great place to enjoy a cold beer or a great“Western”meal–favourite dishes are fish’n&apos;chips&amp;bangers’n&apos;mash. Reasonable prices and nice, friendly staff and management. Opens for breakfast, closes at midnight. 

Sleep

There are plenty of nice and cheap hotels available for tourists and also the high end names like Sheraton for the“business class”people. Do take note (especially lonely male travellers) that most hotels do not allow you to bring back a local female companion to stay overnight. Only exemptions are those seedier hotels mainly used for“other”businesses.

Budget

The main backpacker hangout is Pham Ngu Lao in District 1, just a short walk (10-15 minutes) from Ben Thanh Market. The lanes and alleys in the area between Pham Ngu Lao and Bui Vien are jammed with 5-10 room mini-hotels offering prices around US$6. Don’t be dismayed if every place seems full, you can be assured that vacancy is virtually unlimited at this price. Keep heading southwest away from the backpacker hustle closer Ng Thai Hoc, you’ll likely find that as the alleys get smaller the rooms get quieter and owners more friendly.

If you can find one of the ladies dressed in a blue uniform, stating something about tourist rooms–half the battle is won. These ladies will find you a room in the Pham Ngu Lao / De Tham area in a matter of minutes, eliminating much of the standard“do you have a room”hassle.

 Ly Loan, 241/11/2 Pham Ngu Lao St, Pham Ngu Lao Ward, Dist 1, HCMC, ☎ 8370067. Family run guest house in a small alley off Pham Ngu Lao St. Very friendly family who speak good English. All rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. With AC, hot water, big beds and some with balconies. It might not be the easiest to find, but it’s worth it when you get there. US$13-15.  edit 

 Duna Hotel , 167 Pham Ngu Lao; tel: 8373 699, [7]. Rooms range from US$12 for a single room with no window to US$30 for a triple with a window facing the street. All rooms have A/C, satellite TV, a fridge and are very clean for the price. The staff is pleasant and there is an elevator. The only complaint is that the front door is locked early (around 11 or 12pm) and to get back in you must bang loud enough on the shutter door so that the staff sleeping inside can wake up and let you in. 

 Me Them Hotel , 203 Pham Ngu Lao; tel: 08 6 2915 407, [8]. Me Them B&amp;B provides weary travellers a warm and comfortable place to stay. Me”in Vietnam means mother.“Me Them”is the name of your host–your one special mother for your stay in Saigon. You will feel like you are in a home away from home. You will be like one of the family as you discover amazing Saigon, eat as part of the family, and learn about the local traditions in the process! 

 Hotel Bi Saigon , 185/26 Pham Ngu Lao ( in alley #185 ), tel: 8360678, [9]. Not the cheapest hotel, with a“Superior”room for two costing US$27, but clean, comfortable and terrific staff. In-room Internet access is just US$3/day (bring your own laptop). The lobby houses the La Table De Saigon restaurant, great food and a perfect place to get a snack before heading out on the town. 

 Xuan–Spring Hotel, 185/34 Pham Ngu Lao Street, District 1, ☎ +84-8-8372115 (manager@springhotel.net), [10].

 Nguyen Khang Hotel , 283/25 Pham Ngu Lao; tel: 8 373 566, nguyenkhanghotel@yahoo.com.vn. In a small alley that links Pham Ngu Lao and Do Quang Dau, along with several US$8-20 competitors of variable quality. This particular hotel has a nice vibe, kind staff, free Internet and free breakfast. Recently built (or remodeled), clean, tastefully simple in decoration, rooms have air-con, fan,‘fridge (and those at the front have nice large windows). US$15/day and under. 

 Rainbow Hotel , 283/5 Pham Ngu Lao; tel: 8360039. Large bright (albeit somewhat worn) rooms, and those at the front have a nice view. US$15 or more. 

 Hanh Hoa Hotel , 237 Pham Ngu Lao; tel: 08 3 8372361, [11]. With a real Rattan feel to the hotel, you will be immersed in traditional Vietnamese styling, complete with bamboo interiors, rattan beds, and authentic wooden floors–combined with some of the best Saigon service you can find. 

 Ngoc Minh Hotel , 283/9 Pham Ngu Lao; Right next to the Rainbow this clean hotel with friendly staff and free internet and wi-fi is a good alternative. From US$12 for a room with no windows. 

 Thanh, 40/6 Bui Vien Street, ☎ 8361924 (minhchau_2310@yahoo.com.vn). Bright, clean rooms in an alley around the corner from Pham Ngu Lao. Run by a friendly family. US$10 with hot water and satellite TV.  edit

situated directly across from where the buses drop tourists, it is a friendly family-run guesthouse, very clean and homely. free internet, cheap laundry and all rooms have double glazing.

Mid-range

The area around Ben Thanh market along Le Thanh Ton and Ly Tu Trong has many reasonably priced hotels with clean rooms in the US$25-35 bracket; some provide free Wi-Fi.

 Ngoc Ha , 53, Le Anh Xuan. Close to Ben Thanh market and the New World Hotel. Clean and decent rooms, air-con,‘fridge, Wi-Fi in the lobby. Rooms US$25-35 including simple breakfast. 

 Y Thien , 247 Ly Tu Trong; tel: (84-8) 824 8176. This full service hotel is 5 minutes from Ben Thanh Market and offers a range of rooms from tiny and windowless (yet functional) to quite nice with a full wall window overlooking the city and streets below (try the 4th floor room to the right of the elevator for US$20-25). Rooms are clean, bathrooms are large and recently upgraded (overkill on the shower remodeling). TV with cable, air-con, fan,‘fridge, elevator, all night guard for bikes, in hotel safe. If you don’t want to stay in the backpacker area, and are willing to pay a little more, it’s a good option. 

 Spring Hotel , 44-46 Le Thanh Ton Street, District 1; tel: (84-8) 829-7362, [12]. This boutique hotel is clean and walking distance to major attractions, i.e. Ben Thanh Market and Cathedral. Prices range from $32-$74. 

The area around De Tham is close to the Ben Thanh market and is the backpacker area of the city.

 An An Hotel 40 Bui Vien Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Tel. : (84-8) 837-8087 this hotel is clean, popular and offers comfortable rooms with double glasing in the centre of the action on De Tham, Prices range from $22 for a double room (possibly without a window, but that makes in cooler so isn’t really a bad thing) to $28 for a superior room. Note that the“special”prices on their website are offered off the street, but it is probably wise to book ahead anyway as they sell out. 

An An also have a (much newer) sister hotel, An An 2, which is located on the corner of De Tham and Bui Vien, about 20 meters down from the original An An hotel. Rooms are of a high standard, and the service is excellent.

Many of Saigon’s historical hotels are in the hands of Saigontourist, the former state monopoly. Thanks to recent competition, service and facilities are adequate, although not quite up to modern standards; but if you want to experience a little colonial atmosphere, these remain far and away the best choices at the moment.

 Continental Hotel , 132-134 Dong Khoi Street, [13]. A perfectly located old-school colonial hotel dating back to 1880 and the setting of Graham Greene’s The Quiet American (but not, alas, its filmatization). Lovely breakfast garden, huge rooms, nice balcony views and only slightly expensive at US$60 and up (taxes, service, breakfast included). On the minus side, there is no pool, and traffic noise can be irritating. 

 Dong Do Hotel , 35 Mac Thi Buoi Street, District 1. New hotel with clean and comfortable rooms. Reasonable (around US$20-35) prices. 

 Rex Hotel , 141 Nguyen Hue Boulevard, [14]. Ideally located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, next door to the People’s Committee Hall. Another old standby, former haunt of the press corps and site of the daily news briefing during the Vietnam War. The 5th floor beer garden (Rooftop Garden) is famous and its symbol, the golden crown, is rotating again. Slightly more expensive at US$70 and up, but the rooms are very pleasant. There’s a swimming pool on the roof and an excellent buffet breakfast. 

Splurge

Luxury hotels are popping up faster than mushrooms in the monsoon rains. Expect to pay closer to US$200 for any of these unless you marry the owner’s daughter. The Caravelle, Sheraton, and Hyatt are all within site of each other near the Opera House, in the heart of the city-center tourist district.

 Caravelle , 19 Lam Son Square, across from the Opera House, in District 1. Offers in-house restaurant and spas. Seven kilometers from the airport. Deluxe rooms from US$188 per night. 

 Hotel Majestic , 4 star hotel in District 1, at the waterfront at the end of Dong Khoi Street. It got its start in 1925, and though it has undergone a number of renovations since, it maintains the same basic look outside. Nice but expensive rooftop bar serving mediocre ice cream and drinks, and a non-smoking wing. 

 New World Saigon Hotel . Recently renovated, a single bedroom suite on the Executive Floor is US$250 including butler service, unlimited food/snacks/drinks during the day, and lavish buffet-style happy hour in the executive floor lounge every night. The nightly all-you-can-eat seafood buffet in the Park View Coffee Shop for US$20 is fantastic. On the downside, the rooms can be noisy, and the air conditioning is weak in some rooms.

 Tokyo, Japan 
 Posted on December 24, 2008 by admin Tokyo is a huge city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings — consider printing them all. 
 Tōkyō (東京; [1]) is the capital of Japan. At over 12 million people in the official metropolitan area alone, Tokyo is the core of the most populated urban area in the world, Greater Tokyo (which has a population of 35 million people). This huge, wealthy and fascinating metropolis brings high-tech visions of the future side by side with glimpses of old Japan, and has something for everyone.

 

Districts

Map of Tokyo, Yamanote line in Green, Chuo line in Orange

Huge and varied in its geography, with over 2,000 square kilometers to explore, Tokyo prefecture (東京都 Tōkyō-to ) spans not just the city, but rugged mountains to the west and subtropical islands to the south. This article concentrates on the 23 central wards (区 ku ) near the bay, while the western cities and the islands are covered in a separate article. 

The geography of central Tokyo is defined by the JR Yamanote Line (see Get around). The center of Tokyo — the former area reserved for the Shogun and his samurai — lies within the loop, while the Edo-era downtown (下町 shitamachi ) is to the north and east. Sprawling around in all directions and blending seamlessly into Yokohama, Kawasaki and Chiba are Tokyo’s suburbs.

Central Tokyo

Shinjuku at night

 Chiyoda, the seat of Japanese power (both political and economical) that includes the Imperial Palace , the Ministries near Kasumigaseki, the Parliament in Nagatacho, the corporate headquarters of Marunouchi, and the electronics mecca of Akihabara Chuo district, including the famed department stores of the Ginza and the fish markets of Tsukiji Minato, including the business centers of Akasaka and Shinbashi and the neighbouring nightclub district of Roppongi, the port district (at least in name) which includes the artificial island of Odaiba, the skyscrapers of Shiodome Shinjuku, home to luxury hotels, giant camera stores, futuristic skyscrapers, hundreds of shops and restaurants, and Kabukicho, Tokyo’s wildest nightlife and red-light district Shibuya, the fashionable shopping district which also encompasses the teenybopper haven of Harajuku (also home to the Meiji Shrine ) and the nightlife of Ebisu Shinagawa, a major train hub and business center Toshima including Ikebukuro, another giant train hub Meguro, a residential area with a few nice parks and museums 

Old Tokyo ( Shitamachi )

 Sumida by the river of the same name, including Ryogoku, home of the Edo-Tokyo Museum and Tokyo’s main sumo arena (Ryogoku Kokugikan). Taito and Bunkyo, the heart of Old Tokyo featuring the temples of Asakusa and many museums of Ueno Koto, between the two rivers Sumida and Arakawa, located on just the south of Sumida. It is famous for the former woodland in Kiba, and Kameido Tenjin the shrine worshiping Michizane Sugawara known as the father of study in Kameido. Arakawa The South part of Adachi 

Suburban wards

Understand

Over 400 years old, the city of Tokyo grew from the modest fishing village of Edo (江戸). The former seat of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the Imperial family moved to the city after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The metropolitan center of the country, Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government. (That’s not to say that rivals such as Osaka won’t dispute those claims.)

Culture

Tokyo is vast: it’s best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together. Tokyo’s districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of Akihabara to the Imperial gardens and shrines of Chiyoda, from the hyperactive youth culture mecca of Shibuya to the pottery shops and temple markets of Asakusa. If you don’t like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next one, and you will find something entirely different.

The sheer size and frenetic pace of Tokyo can intimidate the first-time visitor. Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers. At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations. Don’t get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe, poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can’t recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It’s all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.

Language

It’s easier than ever for English speakers to navigate their way around Tokyo without speaking any Japanese. Signs at subway and train stations include the station names in romaji (Romanized characters). It can be helpful to know some tips for ordering in restaurants, shopping in stores, and asking for directions. Learning the katakana script is not difficult and most words written with it can be understood by English speakers so it can be useful even for people with no Japanese vocabulary. If you plan on asking for directions to Tokyo destinations, it especially helps to carry the name of the destination written in Japanese characters.

Expenses

The cost of living in Tokyo is not as astronomical as it once was. Deflation and market pressures have helped to make costs in Tokyo comparable to most other large cities. Visitors from San Francisco, New York, London, Paris and Toronto will not be at all surprised. Travelers should budget a similar amount of money for their stay in Tokyo as they would for any other great city in Europe or North America. Locals will know the bargains, but experienced cheapskates from anywhere in the world can get by with a little ingenuity.

Get in

 Luggage delivery 

Send your bags into town before you arrive—Tokyo is crowded. Lugging even a moderately sized suitcase through the subways and up stairs can be difficult, particularly during rush hour. Delivery services ( takkyuubin ) deliver luggage dependably and quickly to nearly any address. You can send almost any shape or size of luggage, even bicycles, from and to the airport. One exception: if you have bottles of alcohol in your luggage, you’ll have to carry those yourself even if the airline allowed them in your in checked baggage.

At airports and major train stations, look for a sign that says“Baggage Delivery”or something similar. The most common company is called Kuroneko-Yamato , which has an easy-to-spot black-on-yellow logo of a mother cat carrying her kitten. Other companies include Nittsu and Sagawa . Japan Post , the national postal service, also offers luggage delivery called“Yu-Pack”. Fees are based upon distance, expect to pay around ¥2000 within the greater Tokyo area. Usually, the delivery is performed the following day, in a specified time range.

This works the same way on departure. Most hotels and many convenience stores will take care of the pick-up for you, but you should check delivery times in advance, so that your luggage can arrive in time for your flight. Most services require that you send your luggage to the airport two days prior to your departure. You can pick up your luggage in the airport lobby. This makes getting to the airport a breeze. This service can also be used for intercity travel. 

In Japan, all roads, rails, shipping lanes and planes lead to Tokyo.

By plane

Tokyo has two large airports: Narita for international flights, and Haneda for (mostly) domestic flights.

Narita Airport
 See also: Narita 
Tokyo’s main international gateway is Narita Airport (成田空港) (IATA: NRT ) [2], located in the town of Narita nearly 70 kilometers northeast of Tokyo and covered in a separate article. A brief summary of options for getting there and away:

 Easiest : Limousine bus direct to major hotels, ~120 minutes (subject to traffic), ¥3000 Fastest : Narita Express to Tokyo Station, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Yokohama, 55 minutes, ¥2940 (Japan Rail Pass valid) Cheapest : Keisei Limited Express train to Nippori/Ueno, ~80 minutes, ¥1000 Most expensive : Taxi to the city, more than ¥30,000 

Haneda Airport

 Haneda Airport (羽田空港 IATA: HND ) [3], officially known as Tokyo International Airport , in Ota is the busiest airport in all Asia despite being (almost) entirely limited to domestic traffic. Terminal 1 houses the JAL group including Skymark and Skynet, while Terminal 2 is home to ANA and affiliate Air Do. Shuttle services to Hong Kong, Seoul-Gimpo and Shanghai-Hongqiao use the small separate International Terminal, which is connected to the main domestic terminals by a free shuttle bus that runs every 5 minutes.

The easiest and most scenic way from Haneda to the city is the Tokyo Monorail [4] with a station in each terminal running to Hamamatsucho (16 min, ¥470), from where you can connect to almost anywhere in Tokyo on the JR Yamanote line. The other, slightly cheaper alternative is the private Keikyu (京急) line, which has a single station between the terminals and runs to Shinagawa (19 min, ¥400) and Yokohama (27 min, ¥470). Keikyu also runs trains to Haneda from the Toei Asakusa subway line, and even a few direct services to Narita. Note that there is no JR service to the airport , and the“Airport Terminal 2″station that pops up in some route search engines is located in Narita, not Haneda!

Expect to pay anywhere from ¥4,000 to ¥10,000 for a taxi to central Tokyo.

Chōfu Airfield

 Chōfu Airfield (調布飛行場 Chōfu hikōjō ) serves only some turboprop flights to the Izu Islands south of Tokyo. The nearest railway station is Nishi-Chōfu on the Keiō Line, a 15-minute walk away. Alternatively, you can take a bus from Chofu or Mitaka stations.

By train

Tokyo Station

There is a frequent intercity Shinkansen service to and from Tokyo Station (東京駅 Tōkyō-eki ) in Chiyoda, from where you can easily connect pretty much anywhere in the city on the JR Yamanote or Metro Marunouchi lines. For all northbound trains, you can also hop on at Ueno, while all westbound trains stop at Shinagawa.

For non-Shinkansen services, Shibuya and Shinjuku stations offer local connections to the west. Ueno and Ikebukuro stations connect you to the northern suburbs and neighboring prefectures.

 The Shinkansen Tour [5]. Deeply discounted bullet train and accommodation packages exclusively for foreigners. Bullet train services into Tokyo run from Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka. 

By car or thumb

While you can drive into the city, it’s really not recommended as the city can be congested, signs may be confusing and parking fees are astronomical.

Hitchhiking into Tokyo is pretty easy, but hitchhiking out is considerably more difficult. It’s definitely possible for determined cheapskates though, see Hitchhiking in Japan for a detailed list of tested escape routes from the city.

By bus

Highway bus services link Tokyo to other cities, resort areas and the surrounding prefectures. There are JR and private bus companies. Bus service may be cheaper, but the train is probably more convenient. If you have a JR pass, then you should generally stick with the trains.

Long-distance buses use a number of terminals scattered throughout the city, but the main JR depot is at Tokyo Station’s Yaesu-minamiguchi (八重洲南口) exit, while Keio and some other private companies use the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (新宿高速バスターミナル), opposite Yodobashi Camera near the West Exit.

 The JR Bus Group [6]. A major operator of bus services to and from Tokyo. Seat reservations for JR Buses can be made in train stations at the same“Midori-no-Madoguchi”ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. Moreover, the Japan Rail Pass is valid on all bus runs between Tokyo and Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka. 

 123bus [7]. A company that has nightly bus services to and from Tokyo. Its bus services link many cities in Japan. Online booking available in English. 

By boat

One of the great ports of the world, Tokyo also has domestic ferry services to other points in Japan. However, none of the regular international ferries to Japan call at Tokyo.

The main long-distance ferry terminal is Ariake Ferry Terminal [8], located on an artificial island adjacent to Odaiba in Tokyo Bay. The nearest station is Kokusai-Tenjijo-Seimon on the Yurikamome line, but it’s still a bit of a hike. You can also take a direct bus from Shin-Kiba station on the Metro Yurakucho line. The main services from this terminal are:

 Tokyo-Tomakomai (Hokkaido): Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen, 03-3528-0718. This ferry has no passenger facilities, so it can only be used if you have a car; fares for a car and driver start at ¥25,820. Tokyo-Tokushima-Kitakyushu: Ocean Tokyu Ferry, 03-5148-0109. Tokyo-Kitakyushu passenger fares are ¥14,000 for second class, ¥26,600 for first class. 

Ferries to the Izu and Ogasawara Islands leave from Takeshiba Terminal (竹芝客船ターミナル), adjacent to Takeshiba station on the Yurikamome line. Cruise liners tend to use the Harumi Terminal (晴海客船ターミナル), best accessible on bus 都05(To-05) from Tokyo station Marunouchi South Exit or 東12(Tou-12) from Tokyo station Yaesu exit. International ferries and cargo ferries that also take passengers can leave from other terminals too, enquire with your shipping company.

Get around

By train and subway

Tokyo has the most extensive mass transit system in the world. It is clean, safe and efficient–and confusing. The confusion arises from the fact that several distinct railway systems operate within Tokyo–the JR East network, the two subway networks, and various private lines–and different route maps show different systems. Avoid rush hours if possible; trains get overcrowded very easily.

The defining rail line in Tokyo is the JR Yamanote Line (山手線), which runs in a loop around central Tokyo; being inside the Yamanote loop is synonymous with being in the core of Tokyo. Almost all inter-regional JR lines and private lines start at a station on the Yamanote. JR’s lines are color-coded, and the Yamanote is green. The JR Chuo (中央線, orange) and Sobu (総武線, yellow) lines run side-by-side, bisecting the Yamanote loop from Shinjuku on the west to Tokyo on the east. JR’s other commuter lines, the Saikyo and Keihin-Tohoku, run off the rim of the Yamanote loop to the north and south. JR East has a good English information line, 050-2016-1603 or 03-3423-0111.

Tokyo has an extensive subway network with frequent trains, and these are primarily useful for getting around within the Yamanote loop. The Tokyo Metro [9] runs nine lines: Ginza, Marunouchi, Hibiya, Tozai, Chiyoda, Yurakucho, Hanzomon, Namboku and Fukutoshin lines. Toei [10] operates the Asakusa, Mita, Shinjuku, and Oedo lines. In addition, there is a largely underground Rinkai Line, a private line which is operated by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit [11] (web-site only in Japanese) or TWR , that passes through the island of Odaiba.

A number of private commuter lines radiate from the Yamanote loop out into the outlying wards and suburbs, and almost all connect through directly to subway lines within the loop. The private lines are useful for day trips outside the city, and are slightly cheaper than JR. Among these, the most important to visitors is arguably the Yurikamome [12] which offers great views on the way to the island of Odaiba.

Fares and hours

Most tickets and passes are sold from automated vending machines. Keep in mind that JR trains are free with a Japan Rail Pass [13].

 Prepaid fare cards are convenient and highly recommended because they allow you to ride trains without having to read the sometimes Japanese-only fare maps to determine your fare. There are two brands of prepaid fare cards, JR East’s Suica , and PASMO , offered by private (non-JR) lines. Functionally they are completely interchangeable and can be used on just about every subway, train and bus line in Tokyo (with the noted exception of JR’s Shinkansen and limited express trains).

The fare cards are rechargeable“smart cards”: you simply tap your card on the touch pad next to the turnstile as you go in, and do the same when going through to exit. There is an initial ¥500 deposit that you must pay when purchasing a fare card, but up to ¥20,000 in value can be stored on each card.

Most private lines also maintain the older non-rechargeable Passnet cards, available in 1000, 3000&amp;5000 Yen units. If you get towards the end of your card e.g. you have 70 Yen left, then you can either buy another card and use them together in the turnstiles (in which case it will remove the 70 Yen from the 1st card and take the remainder from the new card) or you can use the card as credit for an ordinary ticket.

There are also some special tickets that allow unlimited travel, but most are unlikely to be useful to tourists unless you’re planning to spend half your day on the train.

 The Tokunai Pass (都区内パス) is a one-day pass good for travel on JR lines anywhere in the 23 wards of Tokyo (including the entire Yamanote Line and many stations surrounding it). It costs ¥730, making it economical if you plan to make five or more train hops in one day. A variant is the Tokunai Free Kippu (都区内フリーきっぷ), which also includes a round-trip into Tokyo from stations in the surrounding prefectures. The Monorail And Tokunai Free Kippu , which is good for two days and includes a round-trip from Haneda Airport to central Tokyo, is also sold for ¥2,000. The Tokyo Free Kippu (東京フリーきっぷ) covers all JR, subway and city bus lines within the 23 wards. It costs ¥1,580 for one day, and covers a number of areas that are not served by JR, such as Roppongi and Odaiba. The Holiday Pass (ホリデーパス) covers the entire JR network in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and west Tokyo. It costs ¥2,300 for one day, and is only available on weekends, national holidays and during summer vacation (July 20 through August 31). 

If you’re paying a la carte , subway and train fares are based on distance, ranging from ¥110 to ¥310 for hops within central Tokyo. As a general rule of thumb, Tokyo Metro lines are cheapest, Toei lines are most expensive, and JR lines fall somewhere in the middle (but are usually cheaper than Metro for short trips, i.e. no more than 4 stations). Many of the private lines interoperate with the subways, which can occasionally make a single ride seem unreasonably expensive as you are in essence transferring to another line and fare system, even though you’re still on the same train. E.g. changing between Metro and Toei subway lines amounts to paying the sum of each fare: minimum fare Metro ¥160 + minimum fare Toei ¥170 = ¥330.

It pays to check your route beforehand. The Tokyo Transfer Guide [14] by the Tokyo Metro and Toei subway companies, is an online service that allows you to plan subway and train travel from point A to point B, based on time, cost, and transfers. This guide provides information for Tokyo only, and there are other sites which additionally cover the whole country, see the Japan page. Some major stations have terminals providing information similar to the Tokyo Transfer Guide.

If you can’t figure out how much it is to the destination, you can buy the cheapest ticket and pay the difference at the Fare Adjustment Machine ( norikoshi ) at the end. Most vending machines will let you buy a single ticket that covers a transfer between JR, subway and private lines, all the way to your destination, but working out how to do this may be a challenge if you are not familiar with the system.

Most train lines in Tokyo run from around 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. During peak hours they run about once every three minutes; even during off-peak hours it’s less than ten minutes between trains. The only night when regular passenger services run overnight is for the New Year’s Holiday on select lines.

For additional information for train travel in Japan generally, refer to the By rail section in the Japan article.

By taxi

Taxis are very pricey, but may be a value for groups of three or more. Also, if you miss your last train, you may not have another choice.

Fares generally start at ¥710 for the first two kilometers and can add up rapidly. A 20% night surcharge is tacked on from 22:00-5:00 (10 PM to 5 AM). As a rule of thumb, a daytime trip across the city from Tokyo station to Shinjuku station will cost approximately ¥3000, while a daytime trip from Tokyo station to Haneda Airport costs around ¥6200. These examples are based on standard routing and traffic conditions, so your actual fare may vary in relation to the estimated fare.

Do not count on your taxi driver speaking English–or knowing more than the best-known locations, though most taxis have GPS“car navi”systems installed. The best and easiest thing to do is to prepare a map marked with where you want to go, and point it out on the map to the taxi driver. If you are staying at a hotel, they will provide a map. If possible, get a business card, or print out the address in Japanese of any specific places you wish to go. However, because in Japan streets are often unmarked, if the taxi driver does not have GPS he may not be able to do more than take you to the general vicinity of where you want to go. Also, note that taxis can get caught in traffic jams. No tips are expected or given.

Taxi rear left passenger doors are operated by the driver and open and close automatically. Don’t open or close them yourself.

By car

Tokyo is a gigantic warren of narrow streets with no names, with slow-moving traffic and extremely limited and expensive parking. In this city with such an excellent mass transit system, you would need a good reason to want to drive around instead. While renting a car can make sense in Japan in some contexts (e.g., visiting a rural onsen resort), in general it is neither convenient nor economical to rent a car to get around metro Tokyo. Taxis are much more convenient if your budget allows it; walking or public transportation is much less expensive and given the difficulties of navigation and finding parking in popular areas, probably easier too.

If you do decide to plunge in and drive around by car, the main expressway serving Tokyo is the Shuto Expressway, abbreviated to Shutoko (首都高) [15]. The main loop line forms a circle around central Tokyo, similar in fashion to how the Yamanote Line does it by rail. But whereas the Yamanote Line charges ¥130-250 for a single trip, driving a car onto the Shutoko in Tokyo entitles you to pay a nominal entry fee of ¥700 every time you enter the system, with additional tolls (¥300 or ¥500) collected at various other locations.

By bus

The few areas within Tokyo that aren’t easily accessible by train are served by various bus companies. Buses have a fixed fare regardless of distance (typically ¥200 or ¥210), and fares are not transferable; however most buses do accept Suica or PASMO fare cards (see above). Compared to the trains, the buses run much less frequently, carry fewer passengers, and are much slower. This makes them amenable to the elderly residents of Tokyo, but rather inconvenient for travelers, who will also have to deal with lack of information in English and sometimes very well hidden bus stops. Bus routes can be fairly complicated and are often not listed in detail at the bus stops; signs on the buses themselves often list only two or three main stops in addition to the origin and destination. Inside the bus stops are usually announced clearly several times, but rarely displayed in English. North-south routes are useful in the Western side of the city since train lines (Odakyu, Keio, Chuo, and Seibu) tend to run east-west.

By ferry

The Tokyo Cruise Ship Company operates a series of Water Bus [16] ferries along the Sumida River and in Tokyo Bay, connecting Asakusa, Hinode, Harumi and Odaiba. The ferries feature a recorded tour announced in English as well as Japanese and a trip on one makes for a relaxing, leisurely way to see the waterfront areas of Tokyo. Of particular note is the super-futuristic Himiko ferry [17] designed by anime and manga creator Leiji Matsumoto [18], which runs on the Asakusa-Odaiba Direct Line. You might want to arrive well before the departure time just in case tickets on the Himiko sell out!

By bicycle

Bicycles are very commonly used for local transport, but amenities like bicycle lanes are rare, drivers pay little heed to bikes and traffic can be very heavy on weekdays, so if you use a bicycle, do not be afraid to cycle on the sidewalk (everyone does). Keep in mind, however, that parts of Tokyo are surprisingly hilly, and it’s a sweaty job pedaling around in the summer heat. Central Tokyo can still be covered fairly comfortably by bike on the weekends. Tokyo Great Cycling Tour [19] offers a one day guided tour for biking around major tourist spots in Tokyo, like Marunouchi, Nihonbashi, Tsukiji, Odaiba, Tokyo tower, Imperial palace and so on.

By foot

In this large city with such an efficient public transportation system, walking to get from point A to point B would seem a bit stupid at first glance. However, as the city is extremely safe even at night, walking in Tokyo can be a very pleasant experience. In some areas, walking can be much shorter than taking the subway and walking the transit (the whole Akasaka/Nagatacho/Roppongi area in the center is for instance very easily covered on foot). If you have the time, Shinjuku to Shibuya via Omotesando takes roughly one hour, Tokyo Station to Shinjuku would be a half a day walk, and the whole Yamanote line Grand Tour takes a long day.

See

Lanterns at Chingodo, Asakusa

Tokyo has a vast array of sights, but the first items on the agenda of most visitors are the temples of Asakusa, the gardens of the Imperial Palace (in Chiyoda) and the Meiji Shrine (in Harajuku).

Tokyo has many commercial centres for shopping, eating and simply wandering around for experiencing the modern Japanese urban phenomenon. Each of these areas have unique characteristics, such as dazzling Shinjuku, youthful Shibuya and upmarket Ginza. These areas are bustling throughout the day, but they really come into life in the evenings.

If you’re looking for a viewing platform, the Tokyo Tower is the best known but a rather overpriced, not to say uninspiring, choice. The highest spot in Tokyo is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building (in effect, Tokyo’s City Hall) in Shinjuku. Its twin towers have viewing platforms that are absolutely free, and offer a great view over Tokyo and beyond. However, the best option would probably be from the World Trade Center Building (10:00-20:00, or 21:00 in July and August, 620 yen) at JR Hamamatsucho station which, although not as high, offers stunning views of Tokyo Tower and the waterfront due to its excellent location, especially at dusk. A recent addition to the viewing platforms around Tokyo is Tokyo City View in Roppongi Hills , Roppongi—admission is a steep ¥1500, but includes admission to the Mori Art Museum . Another good option, if you don’t mind traffic noise and smell, is the Rainbow Bridge at Odaiba, whose pedestrian walkways are free. The night-time view across Tokyo Bay is impressive but the walkways close at 8:00 pm.

The city is dotted with museums, large and small, which center on every possible interest from pens to antique clocks to traditional and modern arts. Many of the largest museums are clustered around Ueno. At ¥500 to ¥1,000 or more, entrance fees can add up quickly, but the GRUTT Pass [20] allows access to 56 of them for a flat ¥2000 fee. The pass can be purchased from any participating museum and is valid for two months.

Itineraries

 Classic Tokyo, Modern Tokyo — a one-day tour of the old and the new One day in Tokyo — a hectic whirlwind tour of the many faces of the city 

Do

Picnic in the Yoyogi park during the cherry blossom

 Eat a sushi breakfast at the Tsukiji Fish Market. Take a boat ride on the Sumida River from Asakusa. Lose yourself in the dazzling neon jungle outside major train stations in the evenings. Shibuya and east Shinjuku at night can make Times Square or Piccadilly Circus look rural in comparison–it has to be seen to be believed. Enjoy a soak in a local“ sento ”or public bath. Or one of the onsen theme parks such as LaQua at the Tokyo Dome (Bunkyo) or Oedo Onsen Monogatari in Odaiba. Go to an amusement park such as Tokyo Disney Resort, which consists of Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea which are the world’s most visited and second most visited theme parks respectively, or the more Japanese Sanrio Puroland (in Tama), home to more Hello Kittys than you can imagine. Check out the hip and young crowd at Harajuku’s Takeshita-Dori (Takeshita Street) or the more grown up Omotesando . In the spring, take a boatride in Kichijoji’s lovely Inokashira Park , and afterwards visit the Ghibli Studios Museum (well-known for their amazing movies, like Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke), but you will need to buy tickets for these in advance at a Lawson convenience store. 

Tokyo Dome

 Take the Yurikamome elevated train across the bay bridge from Shimbashi station to the bayside Odaiba district, and go on the giant ferris wheel–the largest in the world until recently. Watch a baseball game, namely the Yomiuri Giants at the Tokyo Dome, or the Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Jingu Stadium. Nearby Chiba hosts the Chiba Lotte Marines. Take a stroll through the Imperial Palace’s East Gardens (open to the public daily at 9am, except Fridays and Mondays). Have a picnic in a park during the cherry blossom (Sakura). Unfortunately Sakura only lasts for about a week. 

Learn

The curious can study traditional culture such as tea ceremony , calligraphy , or martial arts such as Karate, Judo, Aikido and Kendo. There are also many language schools to help you work on your Japanese. Several universities in Tokyo cater to international students at the undergraduate or graduate level.

 Keio University (慶應義塾大学 Keiō Gijuku Daigaku), [21]. Japan’s top private university (unless you ask a Waseda student). Established in the samurai days of yore and has a stuffier rep than Waseda, with alumni including former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. Main campus in Mita. 

 Tokyo Institute of Technology (東京工業大学 Tōkyō Kōgyo Daigaku ), [22]. Tokyo’s top technical university. Main campus in Ookayama. 

 University of Tokyo (東京大学 Tōkyō Daigaku ), [23]. Japan’s uncontested number one university, especially strong in law, medicine and literature. Passing the entrance exams is fiendishly difficult if you’re Japanese, but getting in as one of its 2000+ exchange students is easier. Five campuses scattered around town, but the original one is in Hongo. 

 Waseda University (早稲田大学 Waseda Daigaku ), [24]. Japan’s top private university (unless you ask a Keio student), famous as a den of artists and partiers. Main campus in Waseda. 

Work

Teaching English (or to a lesser extent, other foreign languages) is still the easiest way to work in Tokyo, but the city also offers more work options than other areas of the country: everything from restaurant work to IT. Certain nationalities are eligible for working holiday visas: for others, work permits can be very hard to come by without a job offer from a Japanese company. Consult your local Japanese consulate/embassy as far in advance as possible.

Buy

If it is for sale anywhere in the world, you can probably buy it in Tokyo. Items to look for include electronics, funky fashions, antique furniture and kimono, and specialty items like Hello Kitty goods, anime and comics, and their associated paraphernalia.

Cash payment is the norm. Although credit cards are more and more widely accepted, they are far less widespread than in most other developed countries. Most Japanese ATMs do not accept foreign cards, but post office, 7-11 and Citibank ones do and usually have English menus as well. The crime rate is very low, so don’t be afraid of carrying around wads of cash as the Japanese do. See Buy under Japan. for general caveats regarding electronics and media compatibility.

There are numerous convenience stores throughout Tokyo, which are open around the clock, and sell not only food and magazines, but also daily necessities such as underwear and toiletries. Supermarkets are usually open until 10 PM, while drugstores and department stores usually close at 9 PM.

Anime and manga

Akihabara, Tokyo’s Electric Town, is now also the unquestioned center of its otaku community, and the stores along Chuo-dori are packed to the rafters with anime (animation) and manga (comics). Another popular district for all things manga/anime is the Nakano ward and its Broadway Shopping arkade. Check out the mandarake shop for loads of used and rare mangas.

In recent years there has been an“otaku boom”in Akihabara. A lot of attention in particular was paid to the town thanks to the popular Japanese drama“Densha Otoko”, a love story about an otaku who saves a woman who a train, subsequently following their courtship.

Akihabara is known for its many live performances, some of which has drawn negative attention due to extremist performers.

Antiques

Serious collectors should head for the Antique Mall in Ginza or the Antique Market in Omotesando, which despite the rustic names are collections of small very specialist shops (samurai armor, ukiyo-e paintings, etc) with head-spinning prices. Mere mortals can venture over to Nishi-Ogikubo, where you can pick up scrolls of calligraphy and such for a few thousand yen.

The Antique Festival (全国古民具骨董祭り) [25] is held over the weekend about 5-6 times a year at the Tokyo Ryutsu Center, on the Tokyo Monorail line, and is well worth a visit.

Books

Jinbocho is to used books what Akihabara is to electronics. It’s clustered around the Jinbocho subway stop. the Blue Parrot is another shop located at Takedanobaba on the Yamanote line, just two stops north of Shinjuku.

Cameras and electronics

Ever since Sony and Nikon became synonymous with high-tech quality, Tokyo has been a favored place for buying electronics and cameras. Though the lines have blurred since the PC revolution, each has its traditional territory and stores: Akihabara has the electronics stores, including a large number of duty-free shops specializing in export models, and Shinjuku has the camera stores. Unfortunately, local model electronics are not cheap, but the export models are similar to what you’ll pay back home. It’s also surprisingly difficult to find certain things e.g. games machines.

Fashion

Shibuya and neighboring Harajuku are the best-known shopping areas for funky, youthful clothes and accessories. Note that, almost without exception, clothes are sized for the petite Japanese frame.

Department stores and exclusive boutiques stock every fashion label imaginable, but for global labels prices in Tokyo are typically higher than anywhere else in the world. The famous Ginza and Ikebukuro’s giant Seibu and Tobu department stores (the largest in the world) are good hunting grounds. Recently, Roppongi Hills has emerged as a popular area for high-end shopping, with many major global brands. Other department stores in Tokyo are Mitsukoshi , Sogo , and Takashimaya . Mitsukoshi is Japan’s biggest department store chain. It’s anchor store is in Nihonbashi.

Kitchenware

The district for this is Kappabashi Street near Asakusa, also known as “Kitchen Town.” The street is lined with stores selling all kinds of kitchen wares — this is where the restaurants of Tokyo get their supplies. It’s also a great place to find cheap Japanese ceramics , not to mention plastic food!

Music

Ochanomizu is to the guitar what Jinbocho is to used books. There, you’ll find what must be the world’s densest collection of guitar shops. Plenty of other musical instruments (though not traditional Japanese ones) are also available.

Souvenirs

For touristy Japanese knickknacks, the best places to shop are Nakamise in Asukusa and the Oriental Bazaar in Omotesando, which stock all the kitschy things like kanji -emblazoned T-shirts, foreigner-sized kimonos, ninja outfits for kids and ersatz samurai swords that can be surprisingly difficult to find elsewhere. Both also have a selection of serious antiques for the connoisseur, but see also Antiques above.

Street markets

Bustling open-air bazaars in the Asian style are rare in Tokyo, except for Ueno’s Ameyoko , a legacy of the postwar occupation. Yanaka Ginza in the Shitamachi Taito district, a very nice example of a neighborhood shopping street, makes for an interesting afternoon browse.

There are often small flea and antique markets in operation on the weekend at major (and minor) shrines in and around Tokyo.

Eat

The sheer quantity and variety of food in Tokyo will amaze you. Department stores have food halls, typically in the basement, with food which surpasses top delicatessans in other world cities. Not only is cold food on offer, but also food to go. Tokyo has a huge amount of restaurants, so see the main Japan guide for the types of food you will encounter and some popular chains. Menus are often posted outside, so you can check the prices. Some shops have the famous plastic food in their front windows. Don’t hesitate to drag the waiting staff out to the front to point at what you want. Always carry cash. Many restaurants will not accept credit cards.

Tokyo has literally tens of thousands of restaurants representing more or less every cuisine in the world, but it also offers a few unique local specialties. Nigirizushi (fish pressed onto rice), known around the world around simply as“sushi,”in fact originates from Tokyo. Another is monjayaki (もんじゃ焼き), a gooey, cabbage-filled version of okonomiyaki that uses a very thin batter to achieve a sticky, caramelized consistency. It is originally from the Tsukishima area of Chuo and today there are many restaurants near Asakusa offering monjayaki.

 Hot Pepper Available in various editions, by region, around Tokyo, this free magazine offers a guide to local restaurants in Japanese but provides pictures and maps to the restaurants. Some restaurants even offer coupons. Most restaurants within this magazine are on the mid-range to high end scale. 

Although Tokyo is famous for its sky-high cost of living, it offers a wide range of dining opportunities to satisfy every taste bud of its vast population. While there are many reasonable eateries available, the city is also abundant in prestigious restaurants of a variety of cuisines, both domestic and international, where sophisticated food prepared by renowned chefs are served. All kinds of food for all budgets–this is what describes Tokyo’s food culture and its excitement best. Some of the best cusines include: Sushi, Kaiseki Ryori, and Teishoku.

Budget

Go to the convenience store ( konbini ), there is one every second corner. Really, the options may surprise you. You can get rice balls ( onigiri ), bread-rolls, salads, prepared foods (like nikuman and oden ), and drinks (both hot and cold) for ¥100-150, bento lunch boxes for around ¥500 and sandwiches for ¥250-350. At some convenience stores, microwaves are available to heat up your food for no additional cost. Supermarkets ( suupaa ) are usually cheaper and offer a wider choice, but more difficult to find. (Try Asakusa and the sidestreets of Ueno’s Ameyoko market for local–not big chain–supermarkets.)

Also, look for bentō shops like Hokka-Hokka-Tei which sell take-out lunch boxes. They range in quality and cost, but most offer good, basic food at a reasonable price. This is what students and office workers often eat.

Noodle shops, curry shops, and bakeries are often the best option for people eating on the cheap. They are everywhere. The noodle bars on every corner are great for filling up and are very cheap at ¥200-1000. You buy your meal ticket from a vending machine at the door with pictures of the dishes and hand it to the serving staff. The one question you will typically have to answer for the counterman is whether you want soba (smaller diameter) or udon (larger diameter) noodles. Some offer standing room only (but with a counter to place your bowl), while others have limited counter seating. During peak times, you need to be quick as others will be waiting.

Fast food is available just about everywhere, including many American chains like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and KFC. But if you are visiting Japan from overseas, and wish to sample Japanese fast food, why not try MOS Burger, Freshness Burger, Lotteria, or First Kitchen? If you’re looking for something more Japanese, try one of the local fast food giants, Matsuya , Yoshinoya or Ootoya . For under ¥500, you can get a giant bowl of meat, rice, and vegetables, sometimes with egg thrown in for good measure. Drinking water or hot ocha (Japanese green tea) is usually available at no extra cost.

Raw fish enthusiasts are urged to try kaitenzushi (conveyor belt sushi), where the prices are very reasonable. Prices are depending on the color of the plate, so be sure to check before they start to pile up.

Many of the larger train and subway stations have fast, cheap eateries. Around most stations, there will be ample choices of places to eat, including chain coffeeshops (which often serve sandwiches, baked goods, and pasta dishes), yakitori places, and even Italian restaurants.

The ubiquitous“izakaya”, a cross between a pub and a casual restaurant, invariaby serve a good range of Japanese dishes and can be good places to fill up on the cheap in the evening. Many chains have picture menus.

Mid-range

By tradition the basement of almost any department store, including Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya, or Isetan, is devoted to the depachika (デパ地下), a huge array of small shops selling all kinds of prepared take-out food. You can assemble a delicious if slightly pricey picnic here — or, if you’re feeling really cheap, just go around eating free samples! The very largest department stores are Tobu and Seibu in Ikebukuro, but Shibuya, Ginza and in fact any major Tokyo district will have their fair share. Shinjuku Station is home to several famous department stores, such as the Keio and Odakyu department stores. Many stores begin discounting their selections at about 7pm each night. Look for signs and stickers indicating specific yen value or percentage discounts. You will often see half-price stickers which read 半値　( hanne ). This discounting is also common at supermarkets located at the smaller stations, although the quality may be a notch or two down from the department stores, it’s still perfectly edible.

Splurge

There are countless very expensive restaurants in Tokyo, but one splurge is worthwhile for fans of sushi. The best sushi in town, if not the world, can be found in Tsukiji, fresh from the famous fish market. Figure on ¥3000 for a set meal, which is a bargain compared to how much sushi of similar caliber would cost elsewhere. A sushi breakfast in Tsukiji, after exploring the fish market, is a great option for the jet-lagged traveler’s first morning in Tokyo.

For upmarket Japanese eats, Ginza is guaranteed to burn a hole in your wallet, with Akasaka and Roppongi Hills close behind. You can limit the damage considerably by eating fixed lunch sets instead of dinner, as this is when restaurants cater to people paying their own meals instead of using the company expense account.

Drink

Propaganda, Roppongi

The party never stops in Tokyo (but generally takes place in Karaoke bars amongst locals during the week), and you will find good little bars and restaurants everywhere. You will also find that you are never far from a beer vending machine in Tokyo.

If you’re new in town then hit Roppongi for establishments which specialize in serving foreigners, although things can get a little rowdy in some gaijin bars. The area is pretty dead during the week but livens up a little on Friday and Saturday night. Furthermore, this area might not be to everyone’s liking as it is generally overflowing with foreigners, hostesses and most annoyingly‘patrons’who will continually hassle you to visit their gentlemens clubs. Be warned, a drink will typically cost you 5000 Yen in a gentlemen’s club, hence the reason for the vast number of pimps hassling foreigners. At least the pimps are easy to spot.

Hub pubs are available in Roppongi, Shibuya and most major stations, which resemble English pubs and are reasonably priced. Gaspanic clubs are also in those 2 areas which provide decent music, if nothing more. Throughout Tokyo, Happy Hours which typically last for a couple of hours between 5pm and 7pm at weekends and to 9.30pm during the week, will take the typical cost of a pint in a Western bar down from 900 Yen to 500 Yen, or lower if willing to stand. The First Bar does cheap cocktails in Roppongi on a Sunday night.

If you are looking for a more Japanese and/or pleasant international experience, visit Shibuya for cool nightclubs and dancing. The bar area is between the station and the area where the love hotels are located. Just head over the footbridge straight ahead when you go out of the station and then take a right and follow the neon from street to street. Shinjuku is home to Kabukicho, Japan’s largest red-light district, and the massive gay bar district of Ni-chome. As a gaijin, you will also experience a great deal of hassle in this area, similar to Roppongi. A little further from the city center are Shimokitawaza, Koenji and Nakano, which are full of good bars, restaurants and“live houses”offering underground/indie music, and popular with students and 20/30-somethings.

The cheapest nights out would be at Japanese-style watering holes called izakaya (居酒屋), which offer food and drink in a convivial, pub-like atmosphere. Cheaper chain izakaya like Tsubohachi (つぼ八) and Shirokiya (白木屋) usually have picture menus, so ordering is simple even if you don’t know Japanese. Night out Western-style can get expensive, with clubs and live houses enforcing weekend cover charges in the ¥2000-5000 bracket (usually including a drink coupon or two) and a single drink at a bar as much as ¥1000.

For a splurge on a beverage or two, Western Shinjuku’s Park Hyatt Tokyo houses the New York Bar on level 52. Providing stunning views day and night across Tokyo it was also the setting for the movie Lost in Translation. Cocktails here start around ¥1400–single malt whiskies are upwards of ¥2000.

Sleep

There are thousands of hotels in the Tokyo area, ranging from cheap to very expensive. They are distributed throughout the city, with some of the high end and the low end almost everywhere. Many Western-style hotels, especially those affiliated with American hotel chains, have English-speaking staff.

Budget

Much of Tokyo’s budget accommodation can be found in the Taito area, especially Asakusa and Ueno. But if you are not afraid of being a little bit off-center, you may have a look to the surroundings: Yokohama, etc.

Capsule hotels are generally the cheapest option. They may be reluctant to play host to foreigners as there are quite a few rules of behavior which may be difficult to explain; see the Japan article for the full scoop. Most capsule hotels are men-only. Asakusa Riverside [26] and Akihabara Capsule Inn [27] are among the very few to have women-only floors.

24-hour comic book library/internet cafes have become common around Tokyo. This is one of the cheapest ways to crash if you miss your last train and need to wait for the early morning transit service to get started. No bed, but you have a comfy chair and a PC and/or DVDs if you can’t sleep. Later in the evening, karaoke boxes often offer discounted prices for the whole night, they usually have a couch you can sleep on.

One of the cheapest ways to stay can be also a youth hostel, prices start at 1200, e.g. in the Shinjuku area.

Mid-range

There is a wide range of choices in hotels while at Tokyo, most of the hotels are rated 3 stars or more. Tokyo is among most of the other cities when it comes to hotels because their services and hotel locations are the best of the best. Some hotels one should try are The B Akasaka Hotel, Peninsula Hotel, Tokyo Dome Hotel, Century Southern Tower Hotel, Shiba Park Hotel, Court Yard by MariottTokyo Ginza Hotel, Intercontinental Tokyo Bay Hotel, ANA Hotel, Mitsui Garden Hotel, Mets Shibuya Hotel. Of these hotels,they all have great city views. Most interestingly, Tokyo Dome hotel has an attraction right outside of it . Tourists can check in and have a whole day of fun at the amusement park and mall; best thing is, they can come back to their room anytime and relax after such an adventrous evening!

Keep an eye out for what is called a business hotel . The rooms are usually tiny, but they are conveniently located near stations and rates start from around ¥6000. Staff may speak minimal English, but it’s not too hard to figure out. These are the best options for solo travelers. Affordable chains found throughout Tokyo include Tokyu Stay [28], which offers free internet access and breakfast, and Sunroute [29].

Tokyo has some self-proclaimed ryokan (Japanese inns) that cater largely to foreign tourists, mostly concentrated around Ueno and Asakusa. While not as opulent as the real thing, they offer a sample of Japanese home life at affordable rates.

Japan’s infamous love hotels can be a reasonable (and interesting) option in Tokyo. Shibuya’s Love Hotel Hill offers the widest selection in the city. If you’re really going to spend the night, be sure to check in for a“stay”rather than a“rest”. Be warned that some love hotels (at least around Shinjuku) have a‘No speak Japanese, no stay’policy, presumably to avoid confusion over billing.

If you plan to stay more than one week, you can try weekly-mansion [30]. These are flats you can rent for short periods of time for reasonable prices. Rates are around 5000¥ per day for one or two people. However everything is done in Japanese and it helps greatly to know someone in Japan who can speak your language. Gaijin houses (guest houses for foreigners) can also offer good prices.

Splurge

You can spend a fortune on accommodation in Tokyo. Most of the high-end international chains are well represented. Particular concentrations of luxury hotels can be found in western Shinjuku (including the Park Hyatt Tokyo, featured in Lost in Translation ), around Tokyo station (best here are the Seiyo Ginza and Four Seasons Marunouchi), and in Akasaka.

There is also a large cluster of luxury hotels in what is euphemistically termed“Tokyo Bay”. These hotels are in fact located in Chiba, an adjacent prefecture, and are handy for visiting Tokyo Disneyland but quite inconvenient for touring Tokyo itself.

Contact

Good connections are available at Internet cafes everywhere. Expect to pay ¥400-¥500 per hour.“Gera Gera”is a popular chain. Paid WiFi service is also taking off in Tokyo with reasonable coverage–at a price. WiFi services are probably not convenient for those just visiting.

If you bring your own computer with a WLAN card, it is possible to find a free connection in a fast food outlet like McDonald’s or Mos Burger. You also have a good chance to find a free connection in one of the numerous coffee shops. Just look for a wireless connection sign in the front window or computers within the shop.

Stay safe

Tokyo is probably one of the safest big cities you will ever visit, and Japan in general is one of the safest places to visit in the world. Street crime is extremely rare, even late at night, and continues to decrease. However,“little crime”does not mean“no crime”, and common sense should still be applied as anywhere in the world.

Small police stations, or Koban , can be found every few blocks. If you get lost or need assistance, by all means go to them; it’s their job to help you! They may, however, have difficulties with English, so some knowledge of the Japanese language helps.

Take the usual precautions against pickpockets in crowded areas and trains. The red-light and nightlife districts can be a bit seedy, but are rarely dangerous. Note some small, back-street drinking establishments in red-light districts have been known to charge extortionate prices.

Still in a jam? Call Tokyo English Life Line [31], tel. 03-5774-0992, daily 9 a.m.-11 p.m.

If you make it as far out as Izu Islands, note that visitors to Miyakejima Island are currently required to carry a gas mask, due to volcanic gases. Those in poor health are advised against travelling to the island.

Get out

From Tokyo, the entire surrounding Kanto region is your oyster. Particularly popular destinations nearby include:

 Hakone — for hot springs and views of Mount Fuji Kamakura — home to dozens of small temples and one Big Buddha Kinugawa — home to Edo Wonderland , a theme park recreating 1800′s Japan Nikko — grandiose shrine and burial site of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu Tokyo Disney Resort — with Tokyo Disneyland (just like the ones everywhere else) and Tokyo DisneySea (an only-Japan theme park which includes some unique rides and some imported rides from Disney parks outside of Japan) Yokohama — Japan’s second-largest city 

The Tokyo area also has some less-famous destinations that are easy day trips from central Tokyo:

 Ashikaga — historical hometown of a famous shogun clan Hachioji — a refreshing climb up Mt. Takao through a forest to a shrine and beer garden Kawasaki — home to the Nihon Minka-En park with 24 ancient farmhouses (more interesting than it sounds), not to mention the shrine of the Lord Big Iron Penis 

And don’t forget the islands to the south of Tokyo:

 Izu Islands — easily accessible seaside and hotspring getaways Ogasawara Islands — 1000 km away from big-city bustle, for whale watching, diving and those who want to get away from it all

 Posted on December 23, 2008 by admin 
I quite like how a tourism board interprets it’s own country and produces a visual masterpiece to entice travelers to hop on a plane.  Usually a production team costing a pretty penny is spent on producing them combining the greatest visual effects and touchups to make a smog city into a blue skied wonderland.

 Bangkok, Thailand 
 Posted on December 23, 2008 by Serge Bangkok is a huge city with several district articles containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings — consider printing them all. 
 Bangkok (Thai: กรุงเทพฯ Krung Thep ) is the capital of Thailand and by far its largest city with an estimated population of over 11 million.

Bangkok is one of Asia’s most cosmopolitan cities. Created as the Thai capital in 1782 by the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, Bangkok is a national treasure house and Thailand’s spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.

 

Districts

Bangkok is a large city, modern and Westernised and humming with nightlife and fervour. Administratively, it is split up into 50 khet (districts), which are further split into 154 khwaeng (แขวง), but these are more often used in official business and for addresses. Visitors will find the conceptual division below of the main areas more useful for getting around.

Districts of Bangkok

 Sukhumvit – The long Sukhumvit Road , which changes its name to Ploenchit Road and Rama I Road going west, is Bangkok’s modern commercial core, full of glitzy malls and hotels. The Skytrain intersection at Siam Square is the closest thing Bangkok has to a centre. Silom – To the south of Sukhumvit, the area around Silom Road and Sathorn Road is Thailand’s sober financial center by day, but Bangkok’s primary party district by night when quarters like the infamous Patpong come alive. Rattanakosin – Between the river and Sukhumvit lies the densely packed“Old Bangkok”, home to Bangkok’s best-known wats. Yaowarat (Chinatown) and sights around the Chao Phraya River are also included here. Bangkok’s backpacker mecca Khao San Road and the surrounding district of Banglamphu are located on the northern part of Rattanakosin. Thonburi – The quieter west bank of the Chao Phraya River, with many small canals and some offbeat attractions. Phahonyothin – The area around Phahonyothin Road and Viphavadi Rangsit Road is best known for the Chatuchak Weekend Market and Don Muang Airport . Ratchadaphisek – The district north of Sukhumvit centered around Ratchadaphisek Road (part of which is called Asoke ) and reaching from Phetchaburi Road to Lat Phrao . This area has really opened up recently as the new metro line follows Ratchadaphisek Road. 

Around Bangkok are the provinces of Pathum Thani to the north, Nonthaburi to the northwest, Chachoengsao to the east, Samut Sakhon to the southwest, and Samut Prakan to the southeast.

Understand

The concrete jungle of central Bangkok

Just under 14 degrees north of the Equator, Bangkok is a tropical metropolis that is also one of the most traveller-friendly cities in Asia. A furious assault on the senses, visitors are immediately confronted by the heat, the pollution and the irrepresible smile that accompanies all Thais. Despite the sensationalized international news reports and first impressions, the city is surprisingly safe and more organized than it initially appears, and full of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. The high relative humidity and warm temperature favor the growth of tropical plants — you’ll find exotic orchids and delicious fruit everywhere. Bougainvillea and frangipani bloom practically everywhere. Thai cuisine is justifiably famous, varied, and affordable. Bangkok for many, represents the quintessential Asian capital. Saffron-robed monks, garish neon signs, graceful Thai architecture, spicy dishes, colourful markets, traffic jams, and the tropical climate come together in a happy coincidence. It is difficult to leave with lukewarm impressions of the city.

History

 Bangkok, originally Bang Makok , was a small village on the banks of the Chao Phraya river, until a new capital was founded on the west bank (present-day Thonburi) after the fall of Ayutthaya. In 1782, King Rama I built a palace on the east bank (now Rattanakosin) and renamed the city as Krung Thep , as it is now known to Thais and which in English is translated to the‘City of Angels’. The full name “Krung thep mahanakhon amorn ratanakosin mahintharayutthaya mahadilok popnoparat ratchathani burirom udomratchanivetmahasathan amornpiman avatarnsathit sakkathattiyavisnukarmprasit” is listed as the world’s longest location name by the Guinness Book of Records; an English rendering goes like this:“The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city of Ayutthaya of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn”. The original village has long since ceased to exist, but for some reason foreigners never caught on to the change.

Modern-day Bangkok is predominantly Thai-Chinese and they make up the majority of the population, but the city is also a second home to millions of upcountry“Thai-Thai”folk who come to make a living. The city is also home to a remarkable array of expats from all over the world, with districts inhabited by Chinese, Indians, Japanese, Koreans, Arabs and many more.

Addresses and Navigation

Addresses in Bangkok use the Thai addressing system, which may be a little confusing to the uninitiated. Large roads such as Silom or Sukhumvit are thanon (ถนน), often abbreviated Th or glossed“Road/Avenue”, while the side streets branching off from them are called soi (ซอย). Sois are numbered, with even numbers on one side and odd ones on the other. Thus, an address like“25 Soi Sukhumvit 3″means house/building number 25 on the 3rd soi of Sukhumvit Road. While the soi numbers on each side will always advance upward, the numbers often do not advance evenly between sides–for example, Soi 55 could be across from soi 36. Many well-known sois have an additional name, which can be used instead of the number. Soi 3 is also known as“Soi Nana”, so the address above might thus also be expressed as“25 Soi Nana”. The extension /x is used for new streets created between existing streets, as seen in Sukhumvit’s soi pattern 7, 7/1, 7/2, 9, 11. Note that some short alleys are called trok (ตรอก) instead of soi.

Bangkok

 To make things a little more complex, some large sois like Soi Ekamai (Sukhumvit Soi 63) and Soi Ari (Phahonyothin Soi 7) have their own sois. In these cases an address like“Soi Ari 3″means“the 3rd soi off Soi Ari”, and you may even spot addresses like“68/2 Soi Ekamai 4, Sukhumvit 63 Road”, meaning“2nd house beside house 68, 4th soi off Ekamai, the 63rd soi of Sukhumvit”. In many sois the house numbers are not simply increasing, but may spread around.

To further bewilder the tourist who doesn’t read Thai, the renderings of Thai street names in the Latin alphabet are not consistent. The road running towards the (former) airport from the Victory Monument may be spelled Phahon Yothin or Pahon Yothin or Phahonyothin or Phaholyothin depending on which street sign or map you consult. It’s all the same in Thai, of course, only the romanisation varies.

And if that’s not confusing enough, most of the larger streets tend to change names altogether every few kilometers. Sukhumvit is called Sukhumvit on one side of the tollway (roughly east), but it becomes Ploenchit just before you cross Thanon Witthayu (aka Wireless ) going towards the river. Keep going just a few more streets and it becomes Thanon PraRam Neung (usually said as just Rama I ) after you pass Thanon Ratchadamri. But if you were to turn right onto Ratchadamri, in just a few blocks you’ll find yourself on Thanon Ratchaprarop (past Petchaburi, aka New Phetburi , which is called Phitsanulok closer to the river). Got it?

 But wait, there’s logic to these name changes: most of them are neighborhoods. It wouldn’t make sense to call the road Sukhumvit if it’s no longer running through the Sukhumvit area, would it? Thus, Sukhumvit becomes Ploenchit where it runs though the Ploenchit area. It’s when you’re able to grasp the city in terms of its neighborhoods that it both becomes more navigable and more charming. Likewise, Pratunam and Chatuchak are much more than just markets; they’re boroughs, each with its own distinct character.

Related to this last point, compass directions are not widely used by Thais to navigate in Bangkok. That’s probably because they aren’t very useful; the city’s Darwinistic layout, the changing street names, the winding river, and the lack of obvious landmarks all conspire to confuse your internal compass. Thus, asking for directions in terms of“Is that west from here?”will probably earn you little more than a confused look from a local. You’re better off to familiarize yourself with the neighborhoods and navigate to and from them.“How do I get to Thonglor?”will get you there faster than asking for directions to Sukhumvit Soi 55 .

One exception: the Chao Phyra River is the landmark in Bangkok, and many directional references can be made as“toward the river”or“away from the river”. If you aren’t too close, that is: since the river winds around the most popular tourist areas, river references tend to be most helpful when you’re wandering farther afield than Banglamphu or Sanam Luang or Rattana. And wander you should.

Get in

Most major roads, trains and planes in Thailand lead to Bangkok.

By plane

Bangkok has two airports operating. Allow at least three hours to connect between them.

Suvarnabhumi Airport

Located 30 kilometres (19 miles) to the east of Bangkok, space-age Suvarnabhumi Airport (สุวรรณภูมิ), pronounced“soo-wanna-poom”, (IATA: BKK ) (ICAO: VTBS ) [2] started operations in September 2006 and is now Bangkok’s main airport as well as the busiest airport in Southeast Asia, used by all international flights as well as all Bangkok Airways (PG), Air Asia (FD), SGA Airline (5E), PBair (9Q) and Thai Airways domestic flights with three-digit flight numbers (eg. TG123). There is only one terminal building, which covers both domestic and international flights, but it’s huge (by some measures the world’s largest) so allow time for getting around.

Suvarnabhumi Airport

Suvarnabhumi offers all facilities expected of a major international airport (transit hotel, ATMs, money exchange). The cheapest place to eat is the Magic food court on Level 1, near Gate 8, while perhaps the most comfortable and relaxing of the airport’s restaurants and cafes is the Sky Lounge on the 6th floor. Here you can have your latte while sitting in plush leather sofas and enjoying a panoramic view over the runways–prices are also quite reasonable with coffee around 70 baht a cup. The observation lounge on 7th is not much to see since the steel structure of the roof blocks most of the airport view. There are a few stores in the check-in area including a convenience store and a post office; however, the real shopping experience awaits travellers on the other side of immigration in the departure lounge area, where the number of shops and duty free outlets leaves you wondering if you are in a mall or an airport. Beware though, that past security in the gate waiting area, there are no services except toilets and seating.

 Transportation 

 Limousine taxis (which charge by distance, e.g. around 800 baht to central Sukhumvit) can be reserved at the limousine hire counter on the 2nd floor (just outside Arrivals), and aggressive touts will try to entice you on board. If you allow yourself to be waylaid by one of the taxi touts they might quote you more than double the fare that an ordinary metered taxi would charge (900 baht instead of 400, for example). You’d be silly even acknowledging their existence–walk straight past them.

A better option are the ordinary metered taxis available on the 2nd floor. Follow the“public taxi”signs that lead to the outside of the airport premises, queue up and state your destination at the desk, and you’ll get a slip with your destination written in Thai on it. There is a 50-baht surcharge on the meter, meaning that trips to the city will cost 250-400 baht (plus 2 expressway toll of 45&amp;20 Baht) and take 40-60 minutes depending on traffic/location. (Beware of taxi drivers who claim that the 50 baht surcharge is applied to each passenger as opposed to per taxi.) If there is a huge taxi queue, consider taking a free shuttle bus to the Public Transport Centre, which has more taxis. Go straight to the official“Taxi Stand”and wait there.

There is also a stop outside the 1st floor exit for Airport Express buses , which charge a flat 150 baht and operate hourly from 7 AM until midnight, covering four routes, each taking about 60 to 90 minutes:

 AE1 : Suvarnabhumi-Silom AE2 : Suvarnabhumi-Khao San Road AE3 : Suvarnabhumi-Sukhumvit AE4 : Suvarnahhumi-Victory Monument-Hua Lamphong (train station) 

The BMTA public bus lines are:

 549 : Suvarnabhumi-Bangkapi 550 : Suvarnabhumi-Happy Land 551 : Suvarnabhumi-Victory Monument (BTS) 552 : Suvarnabhumi-On Nut (BTS)-Klong Toei 552A : Suvarnabhumi-Sam Rong 553 : Suvarnabhumi-Samut Phrakan 554 : Suvarnabhumi-Don Muang Airport 555 : Suvarnabhumi-Rangsit (Expressway) 556 : Suvarnabhumi-Southern Bus Terminal (Expressway) 559 : Suvarnabhumi-Rangsit (Outer Ring Road) 

To give an example, the fare between Suvarnabhumi and On Nut BTS station on the 552 is 32 baht, and the journey (On Nut to the airport) takes about 40 minutes in mid-afternoon traffic.

There are also privately-owned BMTA minivans to many parts of Bangkok, such as Don Muang Airport, Bang Kapi, Rangsit, Samut Prakarn, etc. They charge in flat rate 50 baht.

To take a minivan or a public bus, you must first take a free shuttle bus ride (from the outside 2nd floor) to the separate terminal (Public Transport Center). The minivans go directly to the destination, so they are faster than the public buses, which stop frequently along the way.

These services take about 1 hour to 2 hours depending on Bangkok traffic and frequency is usually every 20 mins during daytime and night time ranges from 20 mins to 1 hour depending on route. Long-distance 1st class bus services connect Suvarnabhumi directly with Chachoengsao, Nong Khai, Pattaya, Rayong, and Trat.

An airport express train to the future City Air Terminal at Makkasan (connecting to MRT Phetchaburi) and onward to Phaya Thai (connecting to BTS Phaya Thai) is under construction, but is not expected to be ready before mid-2009 at the earliest. Die-hard rail fans with lots of time to kill can take bus 517 to Hua Takhe station (15 baht), a few km from the airport, and continue on any 3rd class train to Asok or Hualamphong (7 baht).

 Accommodation 

At present, there are only a few hotels located near Suvarnabhumi Airport, though with huge construction projects planned for the area this will change over the next few years. Day room facilities for transit passengers are now available at the‘Miracle Grand Louis Tavern’on floor 4, Concourse G (Tel +66 6 317-2211, 2000 baht per 4-hour block, no reservations accepted). Cheapskate travellers looking for a free quiet place to doze undisturbed at night should head for the prayer rooms.

The Tourist Authority of Thailand and other hotel and tourist agencies have counters on the second floor of the main terminal. These agencies offer hotel reservation service. Check for special promotions and also whether the hotel offers airport pick up and drop off service–especially useful for late night arrivals and early morning departures.

Don Muang Airport

 Don Muang Airport (IATA: DMK ) (ICAO: VTBD )(or Don Mueang ), 20 km north of downtown, was Bangkok’s main airport until 2006. The airport handles Nok Air [11] and Thai Airways domestic flights with four-digit flight numbers (eg. TG1234), but the former international terminal is now limited to charters and general aviation.

The public taxi stand is located on the sidewalk outside the arrivals area (don’t be fooled by all the taxi service booths in the main hall), and is probably your best bet for getting into town — it’s also your only option after 11 PM. Give your destination (English is understood) and you will receive a two-part ticket at the booth. The charge into town will be the meter + 50 baht + toll if you take the expressway (recommended, 30-70 baht), for a usual total of 200-300 baht. The small part is for your driver, the large part is for you. This ticket is for complaints and is how the system is enforced: hold on to it to help avoid arguments later. The trip into town takes 30 minutes and up depending on traffic conditions.

If the line at the taxi stand is long or you need a more spacious car, you may want to book a (so-called) limousine from the desks in the terminal. This will get you a slightly nicer car at about twice the price (500-600 baht). Ignore any touts outside and do not get into any car with white license plates, as these are not licensed to carry passengers.

Across a covered overpass from the airport is the train station . Tickets to Hualamphong station cost 5 baht at the ticket booth. While taking the train is the cheapest way to get from the airport to Bangkok, it is not for the faint-of-heart: schedules are erratic, the run-down passenger cars often have beggars roaming through them, and are relatively empty late at night.

There are also a number of public transport buses going by the airport. Just take a overpass to the real road bypassing the airport and stop the bus of your choice. For example the air-con bus 504 will take you to CentralWorld (a large department store formerly known as the World Trade Center), from where you’ll have access to the Skytrain as well as many other buses, or Lumpini Park, from where you get access to the metro, for 22 baht. Note that large baggage is not allowed.

If you’re flying Thai Airways, you can do a city check-in at Lad Phrao MRT station, from where free shuttle buses leave 1:50 before each Thai flight. The same buses also run in the reverse direction from the airport.

By bus

Bangkok’s three official long haul bus terminals are:

 Eastern Bus Terminal –also known as Ekamai , this relatively compact terminal is located right next to Ekamai BTS station on Sukhumvit (E7). Ekamai serves Eastern Thailand destinations, including Pattaya, Rayong, Ban Phe, Chanthaburi and Trat. 

 North&amp;North Eastern Bus Terminal –also known as Moh Chit (or Mor Chit or Morchit), this is the largest, busiest, and most modern terminal. The upper floor serves the North-East (Isaan); the ground floor serves the North, as well as sharing some destinations with Ekamai (including Pattaya, Rayong, Chanthaburi and Trat). It’s a 30-baht moto hop (or a lengthy hike across Chatuchak Park) from BTS Moh Chit/Metro Chatuchak stations (N8/18), or take the 77 bus and pay the 7-baht flat fare on board. See the Phahonyothin District guide for details. 

 Southern Bus Terminal –also known as Sai Tai Taling Chan , this terminal serves all points west and south from its somewhat inconvenient location on the“wrong”side of the river. Note that in December 2007, the terminal moved to a new, even more remote location, at Phutthamonthon Soi 1 in the Taling Chan district. See the Thonburi District guide for details. 

 When arriving in Bangkok… 

 Late at night , the easiest way from Northern or Southern terminal to your final destination will be by metered-taxi. 

 By tourist bus you may find yourself delivered to their favorite hotel or guest-house, otherwise you’ll probably be dropped off in the vicinity of one of the long haul terminals, or if it’s a service catering primarily for backpackers, somewhere near Khao San Road. 

When buying tickets for buses out of Bangkok, it’s best to skip travel agents and their private buses, and get the tickets for public buses directly at the public terminals. These buses are cheaper, safer, faster and more comfortable and won’t scam you onto a clapped-out minibus halfway along the way or to a bedbug-infested hotel at the end.

By train

The three main stations in Bangkok are:

Hualamphong Train Station

Inside view of Hualampong train station, looking towards the platform

The main station and the terminus of the Bangkok Metro line. Located right in the middle of downtown Bangkok, it is a huge and surprisingly nice station, built during the reign of King Rama VI and spared bombing in World War II at the request of the Free Thai underground. The station has a good tourist office. Only listen to the people at the Info desk–anyone walking around offering to help you“find”a hotel or taxi is just a tout, even if they are wearing very official looking badges. Likewise, the second floor shops offering“Tourist Information”are just agents in disguise.

Tickets for trains leaving the same or next day can be bought on the counters under the red/orange/green screens (see photo). The Advance Booking Office is located to the right of the platforms as you walk towards them and is quite well organized. You can select your seat/berth from a plan of the train, and payments by credit card are accepted.

The taxi pick up and drop off point is to the left of the platforms as you walk towards them, and is generally chaotic at busy periods with scant regard for any queue. The left luggage facility is at the opposite end of the concourse, on the far right as you walk away from the platforms.

Travel agencies may try to sell you a private“VIP bus”ticket if there is no place in first and second class trains, claiming to offer a direct trip to the destination with a VIP bus faster than the train. Although the trip starts with a VIP bus, it ends up with a“surprise”transfer to a minibus and extremely long journeys. Just refuse the offered private bus ticket and buy public bus tickets from the main bus terminals if you cannot find a ticket for the train.

Bang Sue Train Station

If coming from the north or north-east, connecting to the Metro here can shave the last half-hour off your train trip. This is not a very good place to board trains though, as there is practically no information or signage in English. However, this situation will doubtless improve as more and more long-distance departures are switched to here from Hualamphong.

 See Phahonyothin District for more details. 

Thonburi Train Station

Also known as Bangkok Noi , this station is located on the“wrong”side of the river in Thonburi District and is the starting point for services to Kanchanaburi (via Nakhon Pathom), River Kwae Bridge and Nam Tok .

There are two daily 3rd class trains: [12]

 Depart Thonburi 07:45, arrive Nam Tok 12:20, return 13:00, terminate Thonburi at 17:36 Depart Nam Tok 05:25, arrive Thonburi 10:05, return 13:50, terminate Nam Tok at 18:20 

Note that the weekend-only 2nd class air-con Kanchanaburi/Nam Tok“tourist”trains depart from Hualamphong. [13]

By ship

Cruise ships visiting Bangkok arrive at Laem Chabang, about 90 minutes south-east of Bangkok and about 30 minutes north of Pattaya.

A taxi service desk is available on the wharf, but charges extortionate prices–a whopping 2600 baht to charter a taxi (4 passengers), or about 5000 baht to charter a minibus (usually 11 passenger seats), for a trip into Bangkok. Slightly lower prices can be found by walking out to the main road (about 4000 baht for a minibus), however even these rates are almost double the typical rate in the opposite direction. Better deals may be possible for round trips (even if returning the following day).

Frequent first and second class bus services directly connect Laem Chabang with Ekamai (Bangkok’s Eastern Bus Terminal, on Sukhumvit); less frequent direct services run to Moh Chit (Bangkok’s Northern Bus Terminal). A first class air-con bus (blue and white) to either will usually take 90 minutes or less; the fare is around 100 baht. A good way to make the most of a quick visit is to board an Ekamai bus and then disembark early at the On Nut Skytrain Station on Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok (the bus will always pause here provided a passenger requests it); in the opposite direction, use the Ekamai Skytrain Station and board the bus at the terminus. To get to or return from the Chatuchak Weekend Market, use the Moh Chit bus instead.

Buses en route to Pattaya (southbound) can be boarded at the traffic lights on Sukhumvit Road in Laem Chabang, are extremely frequent (at least 10 per hour), and charge less than 50 baht.

Get around

Bangkok has the full spectrum of public transportation methods. Buses and taxis operate everywhere in the city. The Sky Train (BTS) and metro are available only in the city centre. And vans generally operate only in more out-lying areas.

Bangkok Transportation Map

By train

Skytrain

 The Bangkok Skytrain [14] ( BTS , pronunced bee-tee-et in Thai but also rót fai fáa or just skytrain ) Deserves a visit simply for the Disneyland space-ageness of it. Built in a desperate effort to ease Bangkok’s insane traffic and pollution, the Skytrain covers most of downtown and is especially convenient for visiting the Siam Square area. There are two lines: the light green Sukhumvit line which travels along Sukhumvit road and then goes up Phayonyothin to northern Bangkok, where it terminates near the Chatuchak Weekend Market (N8), and the dark green Silom line , which travels from the Silom area, interchanges with the Sukhumvit line at Siam Square (C) and ends at National Stadium, right next to MBK. There isn’t, unfortunately, a station near Banglampu District (aka the Khao San Road area), but the river ferry connects between Tha Banglampu and Tha Sathorn, which is under the Silom line terminus at Saphan Taksin (S6).

You must have 5 or 10 baht coins to purchase Skytrain tickets from the vending machines near the entrance, so hold on to them. Fares range from 15 to 40 baht depending upon how many zones you are travelling. Consult the map (in English) near each ticket machine. If you do not have coins, queue for change from the staff at the booth. If you are in town for several days, weigh your options and consider a rechargable stored-value card (from 100 baht, with a 30-baht refundable deposit and a 30 baht non-refundable card cost, as of Nov 2007), a“ride all you like”tourist pass (from 120 baht/day) or a multiple ride pass of 10 trips or more. They will certainly save you time, scrambling for coins, and maybe even money. Check for information with the English speaking staff.

Four stations are fully accessible to wheelchair users, plus one station, On Nut is accessible only on the arrival side. The other fully accessible stations are Asok/Sukhumvit, Siam, Chong Nonsi and Mo Chit. To acceed to concourse level in these stations, you can use the lift–press the call button and an attendant will come and get you. At On Nut stations on the departures side, the attendant will help you also to get to platform level through the escalator since the elevator can be used only to get to intercourse level. Siam Station is also accessible independently through the linked Siam Paragon department store.

For more information, contact the Bangkok Mass Transit System at Tel: 0 2617 7340, 0 2617 6000 or visit [15]

Metro

 Bangkok Metro [16] ( MRT , pronunced em-ar-tee in Thai but also rót fai tai din )finally opened in July 2004. The Blue Line connects the central Hualamphong railway station (1) to the northern Bang Sue station (18), with interchanges to the Skytrain at Silom/Sala Daeng (3/S2), Sukhumvit/Asok (7/E4) and Chatuchak/Mo Chit (15/N8). You can also transfer to north/northeast-bound SRT trains at the northern terminus Bang Sue .

Park&amp;Ride Building is available at Thailand Cultural Centre Station (200 spaces) and Lat Phrao Station (2,200 spaces) expect this Park&amp;Ride will be full during weekday morning. Parking also available at the following stations:

 Sam Yan Station parking lot, 30 spaces at Entrances 1. Sukhumvit Station parking lot, 30 spaces at Entrances 1. Phetchaburi Station parking lot, 60 spaces at Entrances 1 Thailand Culteral Centre Station parking lot, 30 spaces at Entrances 1. Huai Khwang Station parking lot, 30 spaces at Entrances 1. Ratchadaphisek Station parking lot, 30 spaces at Entrances 4. Chatuchak Park Station parking lot, 1,250 spaces at Entrances 3, 4 North Bus terminal (old) Area. Bang Sue Station parking lot, 500 spaces at Entrances 2, SRT Area. 

Metro tickets are not interchangeable with Skytrain tickets. Rides cost from 15 to 39 baht depending on distance; pre-paid cards of up to 1000 baht are also available. For single ride fares, a round plastic token is used.

The metro stop for the Chatuchak Weekend Market is not Chatuchak Park, but one stop further at Kamphaeng Phet (16). The latter drops you right inside the market.

All metro stations are fully accessible to wheelchair users. If the elevator has been put out of service, just ask the security staff present at every station and an attendant will come and get you to help you to deal with all the process of buying tickets and get to the train platform level.

For moe information call 0 2624 5200 or visit [17] for further information.

Note that at present bag-checks take place at the entrance to each station, although it is usually nothing more than a quick peek inside unless you are looking particularly suspicious.

River Taxis

Taxis that are even more unusual, though equally convenient, are the river taxis that ply the Chao Phraya River. Some are just cross river ferries, but others serve the many landing stages on both banks and cover a route that goes up as far as the northern suburb of Nonthaburi. Call 0 2225 3003, 0 2623 6001-3, 0 2222 5330 or visit [18] for further information.

There is also a canal boat taxi along the Saen Saep Canal.

By boat

Chao Phraya Express Boat

A ride on the Chao Phraya River should be high on any tourist’s agenda. The cheapest and most popular option is the Chao Phraya Express Boat, [19] basically an aquatic bus plying up and down the river. The basic service (12 baht) plies from Wat Rajsingkorn (S4) all the way to Nonthaburi (N30), with stops at most of Rattanakosin’s major attractions including the Grand Palace, the Temple of Dawn, etc. Board at piers with a sign showing the route and pay the ticket collector who will approach you bearing a long metal cylinder. In addition to the basic service, there are express services flagged with yellow or orange flags, which stop only at major piers and should be avoided unless you’re sure where you’re going. The signposting of the piers is quite clear, with numbered piers and English route maps, and the Central station offers easy interchange to the BTS Saphan Taksin station.

Most piers will also be served by cross-river ferries which are particularly useful for reaching Wat Arun or Thonburi. They run every few minutes and cost 3 baht–pay at the kiosk on the pier and then walk through the turnstile.

In addition to the workaday express boat, there is also a Tourist Boat which stops at a different subset of piers, offers commentary in English and charges several times the price. The boats are slightly more comfortable and not a bad option for a hop or two, but don’t get bullied into buying the overpriced day pass.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand’s approved Sri Phraya Boat Trip Co. Ltd can be reached on 02-353-108.

Canal boats

 Canal boats also serve Khlong Saen Saeb, one of Bangkok’s many canals ( khlong ). They’re cheap and immune to Bangkok’s notorious traffic jams, but mostly used by locals who use these water taxis to commute to work and school and shopping, so you get to see the‘backside’of the neighborhoods, so to speak. They’re also comparatively safe—just watch your step when boarding and disembarking (they don’t stop at the pier for long) and be wary of the water as it can be quite polluted, do not let it get in your eyes. Pay the fare (14-22 baht) to the fearless helmet-wearing ticket collectors who clamber around on the outside of the boat, ducking at bridges, as it barrels down the canal. The canal runs parallel to Petchaburi Road, and provides the easiest access from the city center to the Golden Mount. There’s a boarding pier across from the WTC under the bridge where Ratchadamri crosses the khlong near Petchburi, and piers now even have (tiny) signs in English. Be aware that for journeys going beyond Pratunam, passengers have to change boats at Pratunam. Hold on to your ticket.

Finally, for trips outside the set routes, you can hire a long-tail river taxi at any major pier. These are fairly expensive and will attempt to charge as much as 500 baht/hour, but with haggling may be suitable for small groups. To circumvent the mafia-like touts who attempt to get a (large) cut for every ride, agree for the price of the shortest possible ride (half an hour etc), then negotiate directly with the captain when on board.

By bus

 Local buses , mostly operated by the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority ( BMTA ), are the cheapest but also the most challenging way of getting around, as there is a bewildering plethora of routes, usually marked only in Thai. If you can speak Thai you can call 184 Bus Route Hotline . Bus stops usually list only the bus numbers that stop there and nothing more. They are also subject to Bangkok’s notorious traffic, often terribly crowded, and many are not air-conditioned. If you want to get somewhere quickly and are not prepared to get lost, the buses should be avoided (remember that taxis are cheaper than most local buses in the west). However, they make for a good adventure if you’re not in a rush and you don’t mind being the centre of attention.

But for the intrepid, and those staying in Khao San Road where buses are the only practical means of public transport, the best online resource for decrypting bus routes is the official BMTA homepage [20], which has up-to-date if slightly incomplete listings of bus routes in English but no maps. As a printed reference, the Bus Routes&amp;Map guide (50 baht) by Bangkok Guides is another option.

The hierarchy of Bangkok’s buses from cheapest to best can be ranked as follows:

 Small green bus , 7.50 baht flat fare. Cramped, no air-con, no fan, famously suicidal drivers, not advisable for more than short hops. Red bus , 7 baht flat fare. More spacious and fan-cooled (in theory). Unlike other buses, some of these run through the night (1.50 baht surcharge). These buses are BMTA run. White/blue bus , 8.5 baht flat fare. Exactly the same as the red buses, but cost one baht more. These buses are owned by private entities operated in conjunction with BMTA. Blue/Yellow and Cream/Blue air-con , 11 baht for the first 8 kilometers, up to 18 baht max. These buses are quite comfy. The blue/yellow striped buses are privately owned while the Blue/Cream buses are BMTA owned. Orange air-con ( Euro II ), 13 baht for the first few kilometers, up to 22 baht max. These are all BMTA-run, newer, and more comfortable. Pink/white micro-buses –not quite so common away from the city centre–these are air-conditioned, modern and only allow seated passengers (making them harder to use at rush hour as many won’t stop for you). Flat fare is 25 baht which is paid into a fare-collection machine located next to the driver–exact fare only. 

Buses stop only when needed, so wave them down (arm out, palm down) when you see one barreling your way. Pay the roaming collector after you board and keep the ticket as there are occasional spot-checks. Press the signal buzzer (usually near the door) when you want to get off.

Two further pitfalls are that buses of the same number may run slightly different routes depending on the color, and there are also express services (mostly indicated by yellow signs) that skip some stops and may take the expressway (2 baht extra).

Airport buses allow luggage (backpacks and suitcases), but regular buses do not. Enforcement of this rule varies.

A regular bus service is provided by the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) and its contracted operators throughout Bangkok as well as to its outskirts during 4 a.m. – 11 p.m. and around the clock on certain routes. Public buses are plentiful and cheap, with a minimum fare of 7 baht to most destinations within metropolitan Bangkok. Air-conditioned buses have minimum and maximum fares of 11 and 24 baht, respectively. Air-conditioned micro-buses charge a flat fare of 25 baht all routes. A Bus Route Map is available at bookshops. For more information, call 184.

By taxi

 Taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around town, at least if the traffic is flowing your way. All taxis are now metered and air-conditioned: the hailing fee is 35 baht and most trips within Bangkok cost less than 100 baht. There are no surcharges (except from the airport), even at night; don’t believe drivers who try to tell you otherwise. A red lit sign on the front window means that the taxi is available.

When the meter is switched on you will see a red’35′somewhere on the dashboard or between the driver and you. Be sure to check for this at the start of the ride, as many drivers will“forget”to start the meter in order to overcharge you at the end of your trip. Most will start the meter when asked politely to do so ( meter na khrap/kha (male/female)); if the driver refuses to use the meter after a couple of attempts, simply exit the taxi. In some cases, late at night and especially near major tourist districts like Khao San or Patpong, you will need to walk a block away to catch a meter cab. The effort can save you as much as 150 baht. This is often also the case for taxis that park all day in front of your hotel. The only two reasons that they are there: 1) To take you places where they can get their commissions (Jewelry stores, massage parlors, etc) and 2) To overcharge you by not using the meter. Your best bet is to walk to the road and catch an unoccupied metered taxi in motion (easier than it sounds, as Bangkok traffic tends to crawl the majority of the time, and one car out of four is a taxi). Avoid parked taxis altogether, and if a taxi driver refuses to turn the meter on, simply close the door and find one who will. If they say the meter is broken, a good tactic is to turn it on for them. Keep in mind that it is illegal for them to have unmetered fares. Be smart and give your money to honest drivers, not touts. The only reason they get away with this so frequently is because foreign tourists let them.

Be sure to either know the correct pronunciation of your destination, or have it written in Thai, as taxi drivers in Bangkok are notoriously bad at reading maps. Most hotels and guesthouses will happily write out addresses in Thai for you. While most drivers will recognize the names of tourist hot spots, even if grossly mispronounced, it is often difficult to properly pronounce addresses in Thai, a tonal language. If your mobile phone works in Thailand, it is sometimes useful to phone your hotel and ask the staff to speak to your driver in Thai.

If you’re pinching pennies or fussy about your means of transportation, you may wish to think twice before getting into one of the (very common) yellow-green taxis. They are owner-operated and of highly variable quality, and occasionally they have rigged meters. All other colors belong to large taxi companies, which usually enforce their standards better.

On some routes, the driver will ask if he should use the Tollway –this will usually save a lot of time. You have to pay the cost at the toll booth (not in advance, and not at the end of the journey). Watch how much the driver really pays, he may try to keep the change.

When getting out, try to have small bills (100 baht or less) or expect problems with change. Tips are not necessary, but are certainly welcome; most local passengers will round up, or leave any coin change as tip.

By motorbike

When traffic slows to a crawl and there are no mass-transit alternatives for your destination, by far the fastest mode of transport is a motorbike taxi (or in Thai, motosai lapjang ). No, those guys in the pink smocks aren’t biker gangs; they’re motosai cabbies. They typically wear colorful fluorescent yellow-orange vests and wait for passengers at busy places. Prices are negotiable; negotiate before you ride.

 WARNING : Motorcycle accidents are brutally common, and many (tourists and Thai alike) consider transportation of this sort to be inherently hazardous. Motorcycle taxis in Bangkok should generally be avoided except as a last resort. 

For the adrenaline junkie, a wild motosai ride can provide a fantastic rush. Imagine weaving through rows of stopped vehicles at 50km/h with mere centimetres to spare on each side, dodging pedestrians, other motorbikes, tuk-tuks, stray dogs and the occasional elephant while the driver blithely ignores all traffic laws and even some laws of physics. Now do the same while facing backwards on the bike and balancing a large television on your lap, and then you can qualify as a local–though you might die in the process. Imagine your loved ones arranging to ship your dead body home from Bangkok because you took a dangerous risk you were warned not to.

The overwhelming majority of motorcycle taxis do not travel long distances, but simply shuttle up and down long sois (side-streets) not serviced by other transport for a fixed 5-20 baht fare. These are marginally less dangerous, especially if you happen to travel with the flow on a one-way street.

The law requires that both driver and passenger must wear a helmet. It is the driver’s responsibility to provide you with one, so if you are stopped by police, any fine is also the driver’s responsibility. This is worth bearing in mind when you hire a motorbike or moped. Make sure that if there are two of you, the hirer provides two helmets not one. When riding, keep a firm grasp on the seat handle and watch out for your knees.

By tuk-tuk

Tuk-tuks on the prowl

Finally, what would Bangkok be without the much-loathed, much-loved, tuk-tuks ? You’ll know them when you hear them, and you’ll hate them when you smell them — these three-wheeled contraptions blaze around Bangkok leaving a black cloud of smog in their wake. For anything more than a 5-10 minute jaunt or just the experience, they really are not worth the price — and, if you let them get away with it, the price will usually be 4 or 5 times what it should be anyway (which, for Thais, is around 30% less than the equivalent metered taxi fare). On the other hand, you can sometimes ride for free if you agree to visit touristy clothing or jewelry shops (which give the tuk-tuk driver gas coupons and commissions for bringing customers). The shops’salesmen are pushy, but you are free to leave after five to ten minutes of browsing. Visitors should beware though, sometimes one stop can turn in to three, and your tuk-tuk driver may not be interested in taking you where you need to go once he has his gas coupons. Also, with Bangkok’s densly congested traffic it is sure to spend hours of your time.

In case you actually want to get somewhere, and you’re an all-male party, be careful with the tuk-tuk drivers, they will usually just ignore your destination and start driving you to some bordello (“beautiful girls”). Insist continually and forcefully on going only to your destination.

There’s also a less-heralded, less-colourful and less-touristy version of the tuk-tuk that usually serves the back sois in residential neighborhoods. They usually have four wheels instead of three and resemble a tiny truck / ute / lorry, and they run on petrol instead of LP. The maids and locals tend to use them to return home from market with loads of groceries, or for quick trips if they’re available. Negotiate before you get in, but don’t expect to go much beyond the edge of that particular neighborhood.

By bicycle

Go cycling! It may sound crazy, but it certainly is not. Away from the main roads there is a fast system of small streets and alleys. Cyclists are treated as pedestrians, so you can use your bicycle to explore parks, temple complexes, markets and the more quiet residential areas of eastern Bangkok. In more crowded places you can cycle on the sidewalk. Exploring the town by bicycle has all the advantages of going by foot, combined with a much greater action radius and a cooling breeze when cycling.

More than any other place in Thailand, Bangkok offers wonderful opportunities for just sitting and watching people go by. Here’s a partial checklist:

 University student — Many of Thailand’s universities continue to enforce a uniform, and what a uniform: for girls, it’s a formfitting translucent white blouse, black miniskirt and straight black hair. The little shiny logo button on the blouse tells the cognoscenti which particular university she is attending. Boys wear a white dress shirt and black trousers, but ever the non-conformists, you’ll never see one outside school without the shirt pulled out and a few too many buttons open. 

 Office lady — Sharply clad in infinite variations of solid pastel shades, this human houseplant mans customer service desks and pours tea in offices across the capital. 

 Bargirl — Mostly short and dark-skinned farm girls from the provinces, a bargirl can be spotted a mile away thanks to her pink hotpants and the kilo of gold around her neck. Often found in happy financial symbiosis with the sexpat. 

 Sexpat — Fifty-plus, bald, beer belly, stained shirt, lovestruck expression and a hairy arm wrapped around a girl too young to be his daughter. He’s found what he’s looking for. 

 Ladyboy ( kathoey ) — Either tall, large-handed, wears too much makeup, possesses an Adam’s apple and has large breasts…or has accomplished the art of camouflage so well that you just filed her/him as an office lady or bargirl. 

 Expat — A farang walking about purposefully in dress shirt and long trousers, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it’s 35°C outside. For extra credit, try to distinguish between the scruffier English teacher type and the jet-setting expense package type. Or try classifying them by the old joke about the three types of expat — missionaries, mercenaries and misfits. 

 Yuppie — Like every other big city, Bangkok boasts a coterie of young professional types who are hip, well-educated and relatively affluent. Similar to the Expat, they usually sport business attire and are likely to be hurried—except they probably know a shortcut, and they aren’t sweating so profusely. 

 Khao San Road brigade — Braided hair, bead necklace, sarongs, shorts and floppy pants. Either on their way to or just back from the beaches. Dazed and bewildered when torn apart from the familiar surroundings of Khao San Road. 
 

Most of Bangkok’s sights are concentrated in the“Old City”on Rattanakosin Island. Out of Bangkok’s many temples, the following usually make the top 3:

 Wat Arun (The Temple of Dawn). The Grand Palace , featuring Wat Phra Kaew (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha). Wat Pho , home of the world’s largest reclining Buddha and a famed massage school. 

Bangkok’s many markets are an experience in themselves, see Buy for some suggestions.

Royal Palace

 The Grand Palace and Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram or Wat Phra Kaeo (พระบรมมหาราชวังและวัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดารามหรือวัดพระแก้ว) 

 The Grand Palace (พระบรมมหาราชวัง) Constructed simultaneously with the establishment of Bangkok or Krung Rattanakosin by King Rama I the Great, the complex covers a total area of 132 rai and comprises 3 major quarters; namely, Phra Maha Prasat – the throne halls, Phra Ratchamonthian Sathan – royal residences and Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram – Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Formerly, the Grand Palace served as a residential palace for the royal family, with a similar floor plan to that of the Grand Palace in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha is a palace temple just as Wat Phra Si Sanphet used to be in the Ayutthaya Period. A blend of Western architecture prevailed during the reigns of King Rama IV and King Rama V. Major throne halls include:

 Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) , formerly named as Phra Thinang Inthraphisek Maha Prasat, is the first throne hall to have been constructed within the Grand Palace to house royal remains of the kings, queens and members of the royal family. It is also for use in major royal ceremonies such as auspicious rites and merit-making.

 Phra Thinang Aphonphimok Prasat (พระที่นั่งอาภรณ์พิโมกข์ปราสาท) , located near Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat served as the king’s mounting platform as well as dressing area for a royal procession.

 Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya (พระที่นั่งพิมานรัตยา) , established in 1789 and served as the king’s royal chamber as well as assembly hall for members of the royal family and audience hall for ladies of the court to receive royal decorations and title’s paraphernalia in the reign of King Rama VI. It was also where the bathing ceremony for royal remains of the members of the royal family before the urn would be placed inside the Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat.

 Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งจักรีมหาปราสาท) , built in the reign of King Rama V in 1876 to receive royal guests who were monarchs or heads of state. There are also several other principal throne halls such as Phra Thinang Ratchakaranyasapha, Phra Thinang Munlasathan Boromma-at, Phra Thinang Sommutithewarat Upbat, Phra Thinang Borommaratchasathit Mahoran, Phra Thinang Chakraphatdi Phiman, Phra Thinang Phaisan Thaksin,etc.

 Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram or Wat Phra Kaeo (วัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดารามหรือวัดพระแก้ว) Known among foreigners as Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Wat Phra Kaeo is a royal temple situated on the northeastern corner of the Grand Palace compound. It is where the image of the Emerald Buddha is enshrined as well as royal religious ceremonies have been performed. The construction of the temple was completed in 1784, and it has consistently undergone several times of restoration from the reign of King Rama I through to the reign of King Rama IX. The temple’s ordination hall – Phra Ubosot – and enclosing cloister house fine murals. Other interesting structures include a group of 8 Prang towers, Phra Si Rattana Chedi, model of Angkor Wat, Prasat Phra Thepbidon, etc. Open: Daily from 8.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. (except during special royal ceremonies) Admission: 300 baht.

 Sanam Luang or Thung Phra Men (สนามหลวงหรือทุ่งพระเมรุ) A vast open ground situated near the northern wall of the Grand Palace and the eastern wall of the former Viceroy Palace or Wang Na. At the time when Bangkok was first established, the ground was a rice field and was sometimes used as a location for a royal crematorium, Phra Men in Thai. The ground was, thus, otherwise called as ‘Thung Phra Men’ which means the crematorium ground. In considering that the name was inauspicious, King Rama IV had the ground renamed as ‘Thong Sanam Luang’, or the Royal Ground, and the rice farming there ceased. Later, King Rama V had the Wang Na’s eastern wall demolished and the area of Sanam Luang enlarged to cover a total of 78 rai as it does ‘til today. The place has been used as the crematorium ground for kings, members of the royal family and nobility, in addition, to being a royal sporting ground. The king also had 365 tamarind trees planted around it.

Sanam Luang is also Bangkok’s equivalent of ‘Speaker’s Corner’ where folk often get together and debate the state of current politics. The grounds have, over recent history, been used as a location for political rallies and demostrations.

On the King’s birthday (Dec 5) literally a million people come to celebrate the birthday of HM the King. It is open daily and has no entrance fee.

 The City Pillar Shrine (ศาลหลักเมือง) According to an old Thai tradition, a city pillar had to be built upon the establishment of a new city. King Rama I had the Bangkok city pillar erected near the Temple of the Emerald Buddha on Sunday, 21 April, 1782, with the city’s horoscope inside. The original pillar was made of cassia wood known as Chaiyaphruek, measuring 75 cm. in diameter and 27 cm. high. In the reign of King Rama IV, the old dilapidated pillar was replaced by a new one made of the same kind of wood, measuring 270 cm. high and standing on a base of 175 cm. wide, sheltered by a Prang-shaped shrine as it appears today. The shrine also houses images of protective deities including Thepharak, Chaopho Ho Klong, Phra Suea Mueang, Phra Song Mueang, Chaopho Chetakhup and Phra Kan Chai Si. It is open daily and has no entrance fee.

Events

All of Thailand’s major festivals are celebrated in Bangkok, see Thailand#Holidays for the full scoop.

 Chinese New Year Festival . The place to go is naturally Bangkok’s Chinatown, Yaowarat, where the main road is closed to cars and many stores and food stands crowd the road, with grandiose and colourful Chinese lion and dragon processions. 

 Bangkok Songkran Festival . The traditional Thai New Year is an occasion for merriment all over the city, but most notably at Sanam Luang, near the Grand Palace, where the revered Phra Phuttha Sihing image is displayed and bathed by devotees. In the Wisutkasat area, a Miss Songkran beauty contest is held and accompanied by merit-making and entertainment. Khao San Road degenerates into a war zone as farangs and locals duke it out with super soakers. 

 Royal Ploughing Ceremony , May An ancient Brahman ritual, conducted at Sanam Luang, is what farmers believe is able to forecast the abundance of the next rice crop. The event is a result of a series of ceremonies that are conducted by Phraya Raek Na, portrayed by a high-ranking official who wears colourful traditional costumes. This ceremony was re-introduced in 1960 by H.M. King Bhumibol Adulyadej and is considered the official commencement of the rice-growing season, as well as the rainy season. Nowadays, the ceremony is conducted by the Crown Prince. 

 Trooping of the Colours , December. Their majesties the King and Queen preside over this impressive annual event, held in the Royal Plaza near the equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn. Dressed in colourful uniforms, amid much pomp and ceremony, members of the elite Royal Guards swear allegiance to the King and march past members of the Royal Family. 

 HM The King’s Birthday Celebrations December 5. Ratchadamri Road and the Grand Palace are elaborately decorated and illuminated, and in the evening hundreds of thousands line the route from Sanam Luang to Chitlada Palace to get a glimpse of the King when he is slowly chauffeur-driven past. 

Cultural performances

 The National Theatre (โรงละครแห่งชาติ) , located on Na Phra That Road next to the National Museum, is the official centre of Thai classical performance. Call 0 2224 1342, 0 2222 1092 for a current programme.

 Chalerm Krung Royal Theatre (เฉลิมกรุงรอยัลเธียเตอร์) is located on Charoen Krung Road (New Road) near the Old Siam Plaza. Thai dramas and plays are usually held while Khon or Thai musical dance drama is a special event that is staged occasionally. Call 0 2225 8757-8, 0 2623 8148-9 for more information.

 Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre (นาฏยศาลา หุ่นละครเล็ก) is located within the same area as Suan Lum Night Bazaar and presents the Hun Lakhon Lek puppet show. The establishment of this theatre was inspired by the intention of Master Sakhon Yangkhieosot or Joe Louis, the National Artist of 1996, who wished to preserve the art of operating Hun Lakhon Lek puppets. In operating the puppets, the puppeteers require basic skills of Khon performance as they will have to also move their footsteps and hand gestures to coincide with those of the puppets. Each puppet is operated by three puppeteers, lending it lifelike movements. Hun Lakhon Lek usually performs the story of Ramakian, the Thai version of the Ramayana epic. Sakhon Nattasin is currently the only performing troupe of Hun Lakhon Lek in Thailand. The troupe received the Thailand Tourism Award presented by the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) in 2000 in the category of Recreational Attraction.

There is 1 daily show of Hun Lakhon Lek at 7.30 p.m. There is also a corner inside the theatre where Khon mask making is demonstrated, with a gallery of the Hun Lakhon Lek puppets and their background. The theatre is open during 5 p.m.–9.45 p.m. Admission: Adult 900 baht; Child 300 baht Tel: 0 2252 9683-4 or www.joelouis-theater.com

For further information, please contact Tel. 0 2649 9222, or Fax. 0 2649 9200 or www.siamniramit.com.

Pamper

Bangkok is an extremely popular place for all sorts of pampering . The options available range from massages and spa treatments to haircuts and manicures and even cosmetic surgery, all at prices far lower than in the West.

 All self-respecting hotels in Bangkok will have a spa operating on premises offering at least traditional massage services. These tend to charge a premium but also offer some the best treatments in town. Particularly well-regarded spas include Deverana [45] at the Dusit Thani and the eponymous operations at Banyan Tree [46] and the legendary Oriental [47] — the last of these being probably the most expensive in town, offering (among other things) a 6-hour Oriental Romance package for two costing a whopping US$535. 

 Independent spas offer much the same experience but are a little more competitive due to the lack of a captive customer base. Figure on 1000 baht and up per hour for most treatments. 

 The ubiquitous little massage shops found on every street corner in town, offer the best value for money but the smallest range of services, with offerings usually limited to massage only. It is fairly easy to distinguish legitimate massage shops from more dubious places: the real deal will charge 250-400 baht for a typical two-hour massage and will often have a row of beefy farmers’daughters in white coats working on customers’feet in public view, while the other kind has wispy things in evening dresses and too much makeup yelling“Hello handsome”at every passing male. 

 Bangkok’s hospitals offer generally high quality services at a fraction of the cost of a Western hospital. Probably the best-regarded (and most expensive) is Bumrungrad [48], which (for example) charges 60,000 baht for an all-inclusive breast implant package. Bangkok is also well known as a center for sexual reassignment surgery for people wishing to change their physical sex, although this falls out of the scope of a casual vacation. 

 Sightseeing Along the Chao Phraya River –There are special boat trips designed for foreign tourists along the Chao Phraya River to take in sites such as the Grand Palace. They are quite pointless though, as the public passenger ferry does exactly the same trip. In fact, they are even better as they go all the way up to Nonthaburi Town. For a good trip take a public passenger ferry from near the Saphan Taksin BTS skytrain station and go up to Nonthaburi Town, enjoy the afternoon in this pleasant laid back traditional urban town and take the boat back. 

 Thai Boxing Muay Thai or Thai boxing is both a sport and means of self defence. Contestants are allowed to use almost any part of their body: feet, elbows, legs, knees, and shoulders, are all weapons. The playing of traditional music during bouts makes for even greater excitement. 

Boxing Stadiums: There are two venues in Bangkok for this type of sport.

 Ratchadamnoen Stadium (สนามมวยราชดำเนิน), Ratchadamnoen Nok Road, open every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 6.30 p.m.-10.30 p.m., and Sunday at 5 p.m.-8 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.-12.00 p.m. Tel: 0 2281 4205, 0 2281 0879, 0 2280 1684-6. Lumphini Stadium (สนามมวยลุมพินี), Rama IV Road, every Tuesday and Friday at 6.30 p.m. and Saturday at 5 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. Tel: 0 2251 4303, 0 2252 8765. 

 Spas –Spas, traditionally, were towns where public baths, hospitals or hotels were built on top of mineral springs so that people could come and make use of the healing properties found in the water and its mud for medical purposes.

These days, a spa doesn’t have to be a town built on natural thermal springs. It can be a place anywhere that anyone can go to, to relax in tranquil surroundings with a variety of treatment administered to recontour and rejuvenate the body and mind.

Buddhism

 Meditation, the essence of ‘pure’ Buddhism, can be practiced at any temple in Thailand. In Bangkok however, there are also two well-known centers that cater specifically to foreigners wishing to learn or/and practice.

 The International Buddhist Meditation Centre . Wat Mahathat, 3 Maharat Road, Phraborommaharatchawang, tel. 2623-6325 [64]. Meditation classes in English are held at 7-10AM, 1-4PM and 6-8PM everyday in section 5 of the temple. Attendance is free of charge, but donations are welcome. Getting there: Take the river taxi to Chang Pier (between Silpakorn University and the Thammasat University). From there the center is a short walk. 

 The World Fellowship of Buddhists . 2nd Floor, No.616 Benjasiri Park, Soi Medhinivet ( off Soi Sukhumvit 24 ), tel:2661-1284(-90) [65]. Offers meditation classes in English from 2 to 5:30PM on the first Sunday of every month. The office also provides information on places to learn and practice meditation in Thailand. Classes and information are free. 

 Meditation: If you can speak and understand Thai language well, you may wish to go on your own retreat at a quiet temple on the outskirts of Bangkok. To pay for your stay it is appreciated that you assist the resident monks on their morning alms rounds.

Thai massage

 The Wat Po temple in Rattanakosin offers well-regarded massage courses. While aimed squarely at tourists, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as they’re used to conducting classes in English. 

 Union of Thai Traditional Medicine Society offers a more than reasonable alternative to the courses in Wat Po, as they pay more attention to the individual student and practices, conveniently located close to the China Town Pier (No. 5). Contact: Mr. Praphai Kingmala (66)–087-929-8574, 272–274 Rachawong Rd, Sampantawong. 

Buy

Racks of clothing at Siam Square

Bangkok is full of shopping malls and street markets of all types, especially in the Sukhumvit area; see the section for details. Prices can be cheap by Western standards, especially for locally produced items such as clothes, although bargaining is expected and required. Dump a teenager in Siam Center , Siam Square , Siam Paragon , MBK or The Emporium with a few thousand baht and they’ll stay occupied for the rest of the week! Most malls tend to have excellent food courts.

 Weekend Market : A major attraction on weekends is the gigantic Chatuchak Weekend Market (a.k.a. JJ Market), in northern Bangkok but easily accessible by Skytrain and Metro. Take the metro and get off Kamphaeng Phet station which opens right into the market. Takes around an hour on the bus from Khao San Road area. If you’re staying in Pratunam, metered fare should not go beyond 100 baht. Has 20,000 stalls selling everything from counterfeit goods, animals, art, furniture and probably anything else you can think of. Definitely worth a visit for the sheer size of it. There are food stalls everywhere. Forego the cutesy cafes for the humbler stalls. Flavored iced and fried wontons will provide fuel for the whole day. Closes at around 6PM. Keep a close eye on your valuables.

 Night Market : Hugely popular with tourists&amp;locals alike is the open air Suan Lum Night Bazaar . This is a large and colourful market offering bargains on everything from clothes, bags, crockery to organic foods. A smaller, cooler and cleaner version of Chatuchak–same wares sold for 20% more. There is a large food court with a live band every night. Beer seems to be the official beverage of this place–lots of beer gardens here. Covered in more detail in the Silom section.

 Patpong Night Market : Between the strip clubs and bars along Patpong Road is the Patpong night market. This market is designed for tourists and is not frequented by locals. These markets are home to a variety of counterfeit merchandise including watches, clothes, bags, and cosmetics as well as Thai tourist products such as model tuk-tuks and kick-boxing shorts. The prices at this market are exorbitant and anyone brave enough to buy anything here should bargain extensively. Most items available at Patpong Night Market are available for less than half the price at other locations in Bangkok.

What to buy

 Books : B2S on the the 3rd floor of the Central World Plaza is Bangkok’s largest bookstore, holding around 30,000 titles (many in English) and a large selection of magazines. Japanese chain Kinokuniya [66] also has a large outlet in Siam Paragon (Level 3 South) and one in Emporium, both with a very large selection of books in English (the Paragon branch also has a limited selection of books in German and French). The Asia Books [67] chain has several outlets all over Bangkok (see their web site); they have a good selection of books on Asia as well as books on architecture, interior design and decoration. Lastly if you want to trade books, or else buy second hand books, there is a shop between Sukhumvit soi 33 and 35 that does this for quite a reasonable price and is quite popular with the local expats. 

 Clothing: off-the-shelf : Thailand is a major clothing manufacturer and locally produced unbranded clothing is very cheap. MBK, Platinum mall and Chatuchak weekend market are a few places to visit for this. Branded clothing made in Thailand (eg. Levi’s jeans) can also be good buys. For women, the lingerie salons in the department stores are must-sees. Wacoal is locally produced and are half the price in Bangkok. 

 Clothing: tailored : Bangkok is well-known for its plethora of tailors and high-quality fabric available locally. The vast majority of tailor shops are actually just sales fronts for a few large operations that do the actual work, so don’t fret too much about which one to pick; however, do avoid any tailor recommended by taxis/tuktuks or that has to resort to touts, as you’ll have to pay their commission. Avoid super-cheap packages or anything done in 24 hours, as the quality will suffer accordingly. It will help considerably if you know fabrics and what style you want (bring along a sample or at least a picture), and can spare the time for at least three sessions for a suit (measurement, fitting and final adjustment). Tailors can be found all over town, but Sukhumvit Road has the heaviest concentration. 

 Electronics : Pantip Plaza (off Sukhumvit) and Fortune Center (Ratchadaphisek) are the places to go for branded laptops to cheap VOIP phones and pirated DVDs. A must for any computer&amp;electronics buff. See also : Electronics and entertainment shopping in Thailand. Be warned though, electronics are NOT necessarily cheaper in Thailand then they are back home. Also always get international warranty as you would want your electronics to be able to be fixed back home as well! 

 Medicine : Bangkok’s pharmacies (drugstores) tend to offer a very wide range of (wholly legal and legitimate) medicines and herbal remedies at a fraction of Western prices, including many drugs that would require a doctor’s prescription in other countries. Thai pharmacists tend to be exceptionally helpful, and most speak excellent English. There are small, independent pharmacists on almost every corner, and you’ll find bigger (and more expensive) chains on the major streets and in shopping centers. Boots is probably the most ubiquitous chain; they’re also a reliable source for traveler’s toiletries. 

Where to buy

Shopping Areas and Markets

Shopping in Bangkok is not limited to one or two major streets. There are many areas throughout Bangkok affording ample choices and easy access. The following is just a selection of some of the principal shopping areas.

 Ploenchit-Ratchaprasong (เพลินจิต-ราชประสงค์) 

Top department stores and luxury shopping malls are concentrated in the area, namely Central, Gaysorn Plaza, Isetan, Zen, Erawan Bangkok, Peninsula Plaza, all of which together make the largest shopping promenade in Bangkok. Furthermore, Central World Plaza and Narayana Phand Pavilion, host the official handicraft centre selling items from all parts of the country. Ratchaprasong intersection is the gateway to several shopping areas such as Phloenchit-Sukhumvit, Siam Square-Mahboonkrong, Silom and Pratunam-Phetchaburi.

 Silom-Surawong-Patpong (สีลม-สุรวงศ์-พัฒพงษ์) 

Silom Road is the main artery of Bangkok’s commercial heart and is paralleled by Surawong Road, while Patpong Road runs crosswise between the two. In addition to housing dozens of specialist shops and boutiques representing all the major buys, this area also boasts many branches of well-known retailers , Tailors and several shopping plazas.Montien Plaza being the most famous and Excelsior tailors. Street stalls also abound, most notably at Patpong’s famous night market.

 Silom-Mahesak-Charoenkrung Road (สีลม-มเหศักดิ์-เจริญกรุง) 

Silom leads into Charoen Krung Road which parallels the Chao Phraya River, and notable shopping opportunities include gems and jewellery stores (Mahesak Road is a gem trading centre), Oriental Plaza and River City shopping complex.

 Sukhumvit (สุขุมวิท) 

Like Silom, Sukhumvit is one of Bangkok’s main thoroughfares, and the long road is lined with shops, boutiques and modern shopping plazas ranging from Soi 3 (Nana Nua) up to Soi 63 (Ekkamai). Most shops and restaurants are concentrated between Soi 3 and Soi 21 (Asok) and along shortcuts between Asok and Ekkamai. Sombat Permpoon Gallery at Sukhumvit Soi 1 sells both paintings and sculptures by established artists and those of the new generation.

 Pratunam-Phetchaburi (ประตูน้ำ-เพชรบุรี) 

A highlight in the district is Pratunam market, one of Bangkok’s biggest centres for ready-to-wear clothing.

 Baiyoke Tower (ตึกใบหยก) Located next to Bangkok’s tallest hotel building, Baiyoke tower is one of the city’s renowned garment centres.

 Nai Lert Plaza (ศูนย์การค้านายเลิศ) 

Situated close to Pratunam Market, Nai Lert Market is one of many shopping areas in Bangkok where you can buy just about everything from clothing to handicrafts.

 Bang Lamphu (บางลำพู) 

Situated close to the Grand Palace, Bang Lamphu has a lively market where clothing is a popular buy.

 Chinatown (ย่านเยาวราช) 

In the center of Yaowarat Road and Sampheng Lane, Bangkok’s Chinatown offers a profusion of gold shops as well as several nearby traditional shopping places such as Ban Mo Jewellery Street, Phahurat Cloth Market and the Old Siam Plaza.

 Bo-be Market (ตลาดโบ๊เบ๊) 

Situated close to Bangkok Railway Station, Bo-be is one of the city’s most renowned ready-to-wear clothing centres, both wholesale and retail.

 Jatujak or Chatuchak Weekend Market (ตลาดนัดจตุจักร) 

Located adjacent to Chatuchak Park, the weekend market, open on Saturday and Sunday, is a Bangkok landmark where shoppers can buy just about everything from clothing to potted plants and everything in between–- a paradise for browsers and bargain-hunters alike. The market also offers items of furniture and home decor. It is also where professional and amateur art-lovers and artists meet.

 Pak Khlong Talat (ปากคลองตลาด) 

This is a wholesale market for all kinds of cut flowers and vegetables. It is located on Maharat Road near the Memorial Bridge. The market is crowded in the early morning and in the evening.

 Saphan Phut (สะพานพุทธ) 

A night market beneath Phra Phuttayotfa Bridge, known locally as Saphan Phut, selling second-hand items such as clothes, shoes and many other items.

 Lang Krasuang (หลังกระทรวงกลาโหม) 

The name literally means “behind the Ministry” and refers to an area behind the Ministry of Defence on Atsadang Road, which runs along Khlong Lot. On sale are military items such as uniforms, territorial defence student uniforms, shoes as well as travelling accessories like tents, sleeping bags and camping pots. There are shops selling musical instruments nearby.

 Khlong San Pier (ท่าเรือคลองสาน) 

Located in a soi off Charoen Nakhon Road, the area offers items like ready-to-wear clothes for teenagers and shoes at relatively low prices.

 Woeng Nakhon Kasem (เวิ้งนาครเกษม) 

A quarter of Thai and Chinese antiquities and art objects such as blue-and-white porcelain, brass ware and furniture decorated with mother-of-pearl inlay. It is located near Charoen Krung and Yaowarat Roads.

 Thewet (เทเวศร์) 

This is a pot plants market along the bank of Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem off Samsen Road.

Handicrafted products are available at the Chitralada Shop, which offers items from the SUPPORT Foundation, or at Narayana Phand Pavilion on Ratchadamri Road, open daily during 10 a.m. – 8 p.m. Tel. 0 2252 4670-9 and 0 2255 4328-9.

 Taling Chan Floating Market (ตลาดน้ำตลิ่งชัน) 

The floating market is located in front of Taling Chan District Office and renders a blend of a rural market and canal side way of life. On weekends during 7 a.m.-5 p.m., vendors who are in fact local farmers take their produce including plants, vegetables, fruits, fish and various kinds of food to this market for sale. The produce varies seasonally. There are also floating food shops and a private-run canal tour service for visitors to enjoy the district’s canal side way of life as well as farming. Open: Sat-Sun Admission: free Tel: For more details, please contact Khun Noppadol, Head of the Floating Markets Community at Tel. 08 1374 7616 or Taling Chan District Office, Tel. 0 2424 1742 and 0 2424 5448.

 Wat Sai Floating Market (ตลาดน้ำวัดไทร) 

Situated in Chom Thong district on the Thonburi side of Bangkok, this floating market used to be a popular touristic site for visitors to admire a canal side way of life. Construction of new roads within the area left the floating market abandoned before it was recently revived to resume its charm. A canal tour along this historic waterway to enjoy the floating market crowded with boats of farm produce for sale as well as life along the banks of Khlong Sanam Chai, especially on weekends, is available. Stop to visit Tamnak Thong and the old Ho Klong–a drum tower–of Ayutthayan architecture at Wat Sai, a Chinese style royal residence of King Rama III and Chinese sculpture at Wat Ratcha-orot, pay respect to the bejewelled Buddha image and appreciate mural paintings depicting the Chinese tale of Sam Kok or ‘The Romance of the Three Kingdoms’ at Wat Nang Nong, pay respect to Luangpu Thao at Wat Nang and view a snake-catching show at a snake farm on the bank of Khlong Dan.

To get there, drive along Ekachai Road that runs by Wat Sai or take bus No. 43 or 120 from Wongwian Yai. A boat for rent is also available from Tha Chang or Chang Pier along the Chao Phraya River and into canals to Wat Sai. Open: Daily Admission: Free

 Damnoen Saduak Floating Market (ตลาดน้ำดำเนินสะดวก) 

This popular attraction is some 80 kilometres west of Bangkok, accessible by regular bus from the Southern Bus Terminal. Everyday, hundreds of vendor boats crowd the market area in the early morning till noon.

Eat

Bangkok not only has plenty of Thai restaurants, but a wide-selection of world-class international cuisine too. Prices are generally high by Thai standards, but cheap by international standards; a good meal is unlikely to cost more than 300 baht, although there are a few restaurants (primarily in hotels) where you can easily spend 10 times this. Of course, for those on a budget street stalls abound with noodle&amp;meals at around 30 baht. Try:

 Phad Thai and curry at shops everywhere. Tom Yum Goong , you must try one of Thailand’s most famous soup. Street vendors selling satay with hot sauce (for 5-10 baht a piece). Finding a kanom roti street vendor is a must if you like sweets. The crepe-like dessert is filled with sweetened condensed milk, lots of sugar, and can also have bananas inside. Also fascinating to watch them being made. Bugs–yes, insects. They are deep fried, nutritious and quite tasty with the soy sauce that is sprayed on them. Types available: scorpions, water beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, bamboo larvae, mealworms, and some more seasonal specialties. Note: break off the legs from grasshoppers and crickets or they will get stuck in your throat. Chinatown has a range of street stalls and cheap restaurants selling food (try 1kg of huge barbecued prawns or tom yam with prawns for 300 baht) to the discerning local population. All the Thai restaurant chains covered in the main Thailand article. Restaurants featuring cuisine from all over the world on Sukhumvit Road and Khao San Road. 

Drink

The Dome (Sirocco), Silom

Bangkok’s nightlife used to be round-the clock but due to recent social order campaigns there have been quite a lot of crack-downs. Nearly all restaurants, bars and clubs are now forced to close before 1 AM, a few are allowed to stay open till 2 AM. (Informal sidewalk bars do stay open all night, particularly in lower Sukhumvit.) You must carry your passport for ID checks and police occasionally raid bars, subjecting all customers to drug tests (discos only), though these mostly occur at places that cater for hi-society Thais.

One of Bangkok’s main party districts is Silom, home not only to perhaps the world’s most famous go-go bar strip Patpong , but plenty of more legitimate establishments catering to all tastes. For a drink with a view, the open-air rooftop bar/restaurants of Vertigo and Sirocco are particularly impressive. Similar bars to the ones at Patpong can be found in the lower Sukhumvit area, at Nana Entertainment Plaza (soi 4) and Soi Cowboy (soi 23), while a large number of more trendy and more expensive bars and nightclubs can be found in the higher sois as well, eg. Thong Lor (soi 55), Bed Supperclub , Q Bar , or Met bar . Hippie hangout Khao San Road is also slowly gentrifying and a score of young trendy Thai teenagers have also made their mark there. Most of the younger Thais though, still prefer to congregate around Ratchadaphisek Road.

Smoking is forbidden in all restaurants, bars and nightclubs, whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned.

Go-go and beer bars

 Behaving while misbehavin’ 

Some simple rules of etiquette to follow in a go-go bar:

 A drink in your hand is required at all times. Most places charge around 100 baht for most drinks. Lady drinks cost a little more and earn you the privilege of chatting with the lady/gent of your choice for a while. Taking a dancer out of his/her place of employment before closing time will cost you a bar fine of around 600 baht. This is the bar’s share, the rest is up to you two. No photos inside . If you’re lucky, you’ll merely have your camera confiscated, but you also stand a fair chance of getting beaten up for your trouble. Look, but don’t touch (unless invited to). Getting too frisky will get you kicked out. Bring along your passport . Police raids are not uncommon and you’re off to the police staton for the night if you can’t produce one on demand. 
 

The go-go bar is an institution of Bangkok’s“naughty nightlife”. In a typical go-go, several dozen dancers in bikinis (or less) crowd the stage, shuffling back and forth to loud music and trying to catch the eye of punters in the audience. Some (but not all) also put on shows where girls perform on stage, but these are generally tamer than you’d expect — nudity, for example, is technically forbidden. In a beer bar , there are no stages and the girls are wearing street clothes.

If this sounds like a thinly veiled veneer for prostitution, it is. Though some point to the large number of American GIs during the Vietnam War as the point of origin of the Thai sex trade, others have claimed that current Thai attitudes towards sexuality have deeper roots in Thai history. Both go-go and beer bars are squarely aimed at the foreign tourists and it’s fairly safe to assume that most if not all Thais in them are on the take. That said, it’s perfectly OK to check out these shows without actually partaking, and there are more and more curious couples and even the occasional tour group attending. The main areas are around Patpong, Nana Entertainment Plaza and Soi Cowboy.

See also the Stay safe|Prostitution section.

Gay nightlife

Thais are generally accepting of homosexuality and Bangkok has a very active gay nightlife scene, concentrated in Silom Sois 2&amp;4 and a short strip of gay go-gos bars off nearby Th Surawong. Most of these bars, however, are aimed at gay men and the lesbian scene is much more low-key. The most popular gay bars are Balcony and Telephone bar at Silom soi 4, and for the disco crowd DJ Station and its late-night neighbour G.O.D. , which are located at Silom soi 2 (packed every night beginning around 11 p.m.). Bangkok’s two two full-time lesbian bars are Zeta and Shela , with Lesla also open on Saturday nights only. Bring along your passport for entrance age checking (they do not allow people under 20 years old). Closing time is 2-3 a.m.

In a league of their own are Bangkok’s numerous transsexuals ( kathoey ), both pre- and post-operative, popularly known as ladyboys . Some work in the famed transvestite cabarets and there are some dedicated kathoey bars as well, but most do their best to blend in and many have the art of deception down pat. Telltale signs to look out for include tall height, large hands and an Adam’s apple.

Note that some Thai regulars in the gay nightlife scene skirt the fine line between partying and prostitution, and the Western visitor, being considered richer, is expected to pay any food and drink expenses and perhaps provide some“taxi money”in the morning. It’s usually wise to ask a boy you pick up in a bar or club if he is after money, as it’s not uncommon for them to start demanding money after sex.

Sleep
 Individual listings can be found in Bangkok’s district articles 
Boutique options such as the Old Bangkok Inn are now ubiquitous in Thailand’s main cities

Bangkok has a vast range of accommodation, including some of the best hotels in the world — and some of the worst dives too. Broadly speaking, Khao San Road is backpacker city; the riverside by Rattanakosin is home to The Oriental and The Peninsula , often ranked among the best in the world (and priced to match); and Sukhumvit Road has hotels (and hostels) for all budgets. When choosing your digs, pay careful attention to Skytrain and Metro access; a well-placed station will make your stay in Bangkok much more comfortable.

Boutique hotels have mushroomed in Bangkok during the past few years, they usually provide less number of rooms (usually 10 or less) and a more personalized service. With most types of accommodations, a majority of boutique hotels can be found in the Old Bangkok (Rattanakosin Island) and Sukhumvit Road area.

One Bangkok hotel phenomenon of note is the guest fee of around 500 baht added to your bill if you bring along a newly found friend for the night, (very few if any hotels, even five-stars, will actually refuse guests). This is obviously aimed at controlling local sex workers, which is why hotel security will usually also hold onto your guest ID card for the duration of the visit, but some hotels will also apply it to Western visitors — or, more embarrassingly, try to apply it to your Thai partner.

Given its size and poverty level Bangkok is surprisingly safe, with violent crimes like mugging and robbery unusual. However, Bangkok does have more than its fair share of touting and scams , and quite a few individuals in the tourist business think nothing of overcharging visitors.

As a rule of thumb, it is wise to decline all offers made by someone who appears to be a friendly local giving a hapless tourist some local advice. Most Bangkok locals do not approach foreigners without an ulterior motive.

In 2008, political unrest hit the headlines, with the yellow-shirted People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) closing down both of Bangkok’s airports for a week and several people killed in political violence. As of December 2008, things are more or less back to normal, but the situation remains unstable.

Scams

Some common scams and guidelines for avoiding them:

 Beware of all offers of gems and (supposedly) precious stones. These sophisticated and highly professional“special discount”scams, often involving promises of high resale value back home at a supposedly huge profit, sometimes even employ foreigners to act as satisfied customers. 

 Beware of tuk-tuk drivers offering all-day tours for prices as low as 10 baht . You may indeed be taken on a full-day tour, but you will only end up visiting one gem and souvenir shop after another. The driver gets a commission if you buy something and gas coupons even if you don’t. 

 Insist on the meter for taxis, and agree on a price in advance for tuk-tuks. If they refuse, or quote silly prices, just walk out and get a different one, they’re rarely in short supply. 

 Be highly skeptical of anyone telling you that your intended destination is currently closed (including skytrain and metro stations), or offering discount admissions. Temples are almost always free (the main exceptions are Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Pho) and open just about every day of the year. Anyone telling you otherwise, even if they have an official-looking identification card, is most likely out to scam you, especially if they suggest some alternate sights to see until the sight reopens. At paid admission sites, verify the operating hours at the ticket window. 
 One particularly smooth scam–so smooth you’d never realize it was a scam–occurs when someone standing near the entrance to a tourist destination tells you it’s temporarily closed for a special event and suggests some alternate (free!) sights to see for the next few hours until it reopens. The sights sound harmless enough–beautiful temples and cultural centers–and the person says you should be able to get a tuk-tuk to visit them all (and wait for you at each one) for a pretty low price (maybe 40 baht per person–not quite low enough to arouse suspicion). He might even tell you to only use the tuk-tuks with yellow license plates with a taxi sign on top, as the ones with white license plates are unregistered, while the yellow ones are government-controlled (yet another friendly, trust-building piece of advice). He’ll wave a tuk-tuk over for you and“negotiate”with the driver for your tour and give you a map (or draw on one you have) with these destinations written down. At the first stop–a beautiful, quiet, neighborhood wat–you’ll“randomly”stumble into a friendly stranger (who may even claim to have lived in the States for awhile and will chat you up about life there–an honest, friendly person, right?), who will tell you that there was a big celebration the previous day and that there is a gem store offering special prices for that day only because of the celebration. He’ll ask for the map that the first person gave you and confirm that it’s the same place you were already going to. Surely two independent people, with absolutely no ties between them and halfway across the city, can’t be wrong, can they? You’ll visit a gem shop, which probably has hugely overinflated prices. It might even look like a quality place–clean, modern, large, a huge assortment of jewelry (it’s not necessarily junk, though always be skeptical of gem quality at any shop). After that, the tuk-tuk driver will offer to take you to your third destination, another historic wat, only after you stop at one shop–a tailor, souvenier, or rug shop, probably. He’ll collect his gas coupon or commission while you are pressured into buying something, and then you’re on your way to the last place–maybe. Your one stop may turn into three, and you might not ever get back to your original tourist destination unless you put your foot down or simply get out and take a cab (or another tuk-tuk…). It’s so smooth–seemingly unrelated people handing you off to each other (yet all making a profit on you–you never see them communicate with each other, but it’s all set up beforehand), but it’s been perfected to seem like just friendly advice from locals who know the secrets–surely there are good people in the world, right? Wrong. You can never be too careful or too skeptical. (See here for some other similar accounts: [68][69]) 
 There is no such thing as a Lucky Buddha or Lucky Buddha day! Touts are out to trick you into getting a tuk-tuk to visit several souvenir shops or a gem scam shop. 

 At popular tourist sites, if an English-speaking Thai approaches you out of the blue and strikes up a conversation, be wary, they are almost certainly selling something. If they ask you if it’s your first time in Thailand, it’s probably best to answer‘no’and walk away. 

 In the go-go bar zones, beware of touts who try to drag you into the upstairs bars with offers of ping-pong shows and 100-baht beer. The beer may well be 100 baht, but the“show”you’ll be treated to will be 1000 baht or more. Rule of thumb is, if you can’t see inside from street level, the establishment is best avoided. 

 Beware of private bus companies offering direct trips from Bangkok to other cities with VIP buses. There are a lot of scams performed by some private bus companies. The so-called direct VIP trips may end up changing three or four uncomfortable minibuses to the destination, the 10-11 hours trip may be 17-18 hours. Try to book public BKS buses from the main bus terminals. 

Fights

 DO NOT GET INTO FIGHTS WITH THE LOCALS . Thais are peace loving people but when it’s a Thai versus a Foreigner, it might NOT always be a fair fight. You’ll wind up having to fight 10 to 20 others who were not initially involved. Weaponry (knives, broken bottles, metal rods, Muay Thai) are usually not omitted, with foreigners getting seriously injured or worse. Avoid all confrontations .

Prostitution

The age of consent is 15 but a higher minimum age of 18 applies in the case of prostitutes. Penalties for sex with minors are harsh.

All adult Thais must carry an identity card, which will state that they were born in 2532 or earlier if they were over the age of 18 on January 1st 2008 (in the Thai calendar, CE 2008 is the year 2551). Many hotels retain the ID cards of prostitutes for the duration of their visit.

Whilst most prostitutes are employed by bars or similar businesses, some are“freelancers”. Petty theft and other problems are more common with“freelancers”.

HIV/AIDS awareness is better than it used to be but infection statistics among entertainment industry workers remain high;“freelancers”are the highest risk group. Almost all girls insist on using condoms.

Technically, some aspects of prostitution are illegal (eg soliciting, pimping), however enforcement is liberal and brothels are commonplace. It’s not illegal to pay for sex or to pay a“barfine”(a fee the bar collects if you want to take an employee away).

The novel“The Butterfly Trap”gives a realistic first-person account of Bangkok’s nightlife industry.

 New Zealand 
 Posted on December 16, 2008 by admin 
 New Zealand , also known in the native Maori language as Aotearoa , is a temperate to sub-tropical island nation in the South Pacific Ocean. A former British colony, it has a population mainly of European descent, with a sizeable indigenous Maori minority and smaller minorities of various Polynesian and other groups.

A modern but sparsely populated country, it boasts natural beauty and a wide range of outdoor and adventure activities.

Understand

New Zealand has been called God’s own country and the&quot;Paradise of the Pacific&quot;since the early 1800s. Travellers generally agree New Zealand deserves this description.

A common mistake is not allowing sufficient time to travel New Zealand. Many travellers spending nearly all of their holiday time in Australia, then wishing that they had spent an equal or longer time in this variegated archipelago.

Relax and allow at least three or four weeks for each island!

 Lonely Planet named New Zealand the world’s top travel destination for the second year running (2003/2004), and it was voted best long-haul travel destination in the 2004 Guardian and Observer’s People’s Choice award . It has won the award in three out of the past four years. At the 2005 Condé Nast Traveller Awards, readers voted New Zealand as the best holiday destination in the world. New Zealand is also known by the Maori name of Aotearoa , which is usually translated as&quot;(Land of the) long white cloud&quot;.

Geography

New Zealand consists of two main islands and many smaller ones in the South Pacific Ocean approximately 2000 km southeast of Australia. With a population of four million in a country about the size of the United Kingdom, many areas are sparsely settled.

Auckland, with a population of around 1.25 million people is the largest city in Polynesia.

Settlement and history

New Zealand was the last significant land mass to be inhabited by humans, both in terms of indigenous settlement and European domination. This, combined with geological youth and geographical isolation, has led to the development of a young, vigorous nation with a well-travelled, well-educated expatriate population of 1,000,000. 1 in 4 born New Zealanders and 1 in 3 between ages 22 and 48 have left their place of Birth for more favorable locations. It also has some spectacular scenery, flora and fauna.

The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about 800 AD. Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, in 1642, was the first European to see New Zealand, and his mapped coastline appeared on Dutch maps as&quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot;from as early as 1645. British naval Captain James Cook rediscovered, circumnavigated and mapped the islands in 1769. A few people, mostly sealers, whalers, traders and missionaries, settled during the next 80 years and the islands were administered by the British colony in New South Wales.

In 1840, with the assistance of missionaries, the Maori agreed to accept British sovereignty over the islands through the Treaty of Waitangi. More intensive settlement began that same year. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872, coupled with political maneuvering and the spread of European diseases, broke Maori resistance to land settlement, but left lasting grievances. In recent years the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances, and this is a complicated process. In 2005, the Maori Party was formed, in part in response to the Government’s law on the Foreshore and Seabed but also to promote an independent Maori perspective at a political level.

The British colony of New Zealand became a dominion in 1907. It was offered complete independence under the 1931 Statute of Westminster, although it did not adopt this until 1947. However the Constitution of Australia permits New Zealand to join as another Australian state. New Zealand supported the United Kingdom militarily in the Boer War of 1899–1902, as well as both World Wars. It also participated in wars in Malaya, Korea and Viet Nam under various military alliances, most notably the ANZUS treaty with Australia and the United States.

New Zealand’s elite has strongly opposed the testing and use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear armed warship visits meant that the Parliament enacted anti-nuclear legislation in the mid-1980s. This led to the abandonment of New Zealand’s commitment to the ANZUS defence alliance. The New Zealand military continues be limited in capacity to take roles in UN- peacekeeping operations worldwide as often as its budget can bear.

Time zones

New Zealand Standard Time is 12 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). New Zealand utilises daylight saving in summer. From 30 September 2007, daylight saving hours will be changed to extend the period to 27 weeks. It commences at 2am on the last Sunday in September when clocks go forward an hour, and ends at 2am on the first Sunday in April when clocks go back an hour of the following year. During daylight savings time New Zealand is 13 hours ahead of GMT. The Chatham Islands have their own time zone, 45 minutes ahead of the rest of New Zealand.

Sports

The national sports in New Zealand are rugby union and netball in winter, and cricket in summer. The Super 14 season runs from February to May, and the National Provincial Championship runs later in the year. The national team, the All Blacks, generally play matches at home during June through to September, mainly in the Tri Nations.

Climate

New Zealand has a temperate climate in the south island and sub-tropical climate in the North Island and the nature of the terrain, the prevailing winds and the length of the country lead to sharp regional contrasts. Temperatures sometimes exceed 30°C and fall below 0°C only in the elevated inland regions. Generally speaking, rainfall and humidity is higher in the west than the east of the country due to the north-south orientation of the mountain ranges and the prevailing westerly/north westerly winds.

Part situated in the Roaring Forties, unsheltered areas of the country can get a bit breezy, especially in the centre, through Cook Strait and around Wellington. The winds seem to be stronger around the equinoxes. In the winter, southerly gales can be severe but they also bring snow to the ski-fields and are usually followed by calm clear days.

New Zealand is one of the most difficult countries in the world in which to forecast the weather. Although the weather is changeable, there is certainly more sunshine and warm temperate temperatures to enjoy in summer. It is not uncommon, especially on the South Island, to experience four seasons in one day.

New Zealand is a small country surrounded by ocean. A complicating, but often beneficial factor on the day to day weather, is the steep mountain range running down the spine of New Zealand orientated in a southwest-northeast direction. These mountains often shelter eastern parts of the country from an onslaught of westerly winds and rain.

The weather is mostly influenced by fast moving weather systems in the strong westerly winds, which are often referred to as the Roaring forties, that predominate over southern parts of the country and seas to the south. There tends to be a seven day cycle associated with these westerlies as a cold front sweeps over the country associated with a couple of days rain, somewhere over the country. Often though these westerlies are disrupted by large high pressure systems or by storm systems.

During the summer and early autumn months from about December to April, the westerlies tend to move south giving more settled weather. Always be prepared for a change though. Also, during this time, random weather systems from the tropics can make their presence felt, mainly over the North Island, with a period of warm wet windy weather.

In the Winter, May to August, the weather tends to be more changeable. Cold fronts often bring a period of rain to western areas followed by a cold wind from the south bringing snow to the mountains and sometimes to near sea level over eastern parts of the South Island. When the weather turns cold and wet in the east, to the west of the mountains it will be fantastic. At this time of the year it is not uncommon for high pressure systems and clear skies to park over the whole country for long periods bringing crisp frosty nights and mornings followed by cool sunny days.

In spring, from August to November, the westerly winds are typically at their strongest – these are called the equinoctial westerlies. It tends to rain more in western areas, and especially on the South Island, at this time, while in the east, warm dry winds can give great cycling weather. Once again though, a cold front and its accompanying south winds can give you a taste of winter at any stage.

Regions

New Zealand is a very diverse country with many regions that are worth seeing, but at a high level it’s easiest to break it down according to its two main islands and the smaller offshore islands.
 
Regions, major cities and other destinations in NZ
 
 
 North Island 
Warm, with scenery ranging from sandy beaches, through rolling farmland and forests to active volcanic peaks with bubbling mud pools. 

 South Island 
Spectacular mountains and fjords, large beech forests, beautiful beaches, large glaciers. 

 Offshore Islands (Stewart Island, Chatham Islands, Sub-Antarctic Islands)
The other, more wild, islands of New Zealand, ranging from the nearby and accessible Stewart Island to the remote windswept Sub-Antarctic Islands and the distant uninhabited Kermadec Islands. 

Cities

It’s the country that’s magnificent in New Zealand and we only list nine of the most prominent settlements. Here they are from north to south:

North Island:

 Auckland –&quot;The City of Sails&quot;–largest and most populated conurbation, with over a million in the metropolitan area, making it the largest in Polynesia by far Hamilton –128km south of Auckland, capital of the Waikato, home to the Chiefs (super 14 rugby) and the Magic ( ANZ cup netball). On the banks of the mighty Waikato River. Leafy. Tauranga –known for its great weather, sun and beach Tauranga is a great holiday spot. Rotorua –famous for Maori culture, geysers and beautiful hot pools Wellington –the national capital, also known as&quot;The Windy City&quot;–Parliament and the Beehive and the wonderful, free Te Papa museum 

South Island:

 Nelson –safe and friendly, with New Zealand’s highest sunshine hours. Nelson is the geographic centre of the country and surrounded by three stunning national parks, vineyards and orchards Christchurch –The Garden City and the Air Gateway to Antarctica Queenstown –adrenalin and adventure capital of the world, where you can skydive, bungy jump, jet-boat, thrill yourself to your hearts content Dunedin –the Edinburgh of the South, proud of its Scots heritage, chocolate factory, Southern Albatross colony and its wonderful tramping tracks within a short drive from the CBD Invercargill –the southernmost city and one of the very few places to see a living Tuatara 

Other destinations
 
New Zealand has a wealth of national parks, rural areas and other out-of-the-way places that are worth a visit. Nine of the best are listed below from north to south, but there are many more in the various regions of the country.

 Bay of Islands–Pretty spot in the North Island with historical significance. Coromandel Peninsula–Rugged coastline with plenty of beaches and hiking opportunities just two hours from Auckland. Taupo–Trout fishing and adventure activities in the central North Island. Tongariro National Park–Three volcanoes, two skifields and one of the most popular hikes in the country. Hawkes Bay–Wineries in the hills and art deco architecture in Napier. Abel Tasman National Park–Golden sand beaches, kayaking and the Abel Tasman Coastal Track. Westland National Park–Home of the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers. Aoraki Mount Cook National Park–Lots of hiking opportunities and New Zealand’s highest mountain. Milford Sound–Beautiful fiord in Fiordland National Park. 

Get in

Arrivals are by plane or occasionally by boat (typically cruise ships through Auckland).

By plane

There are international airports at Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Queenstown. The main gateways are Auckland and Christchurch, with Auckland servicing more than 20 destinations and a dozen airlines, and direct connections from Christchurch to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Singapore, and Tokyo.

Due to its large Polynesian and Melanesian expatriate communities, New Zealand has extensive direct flight options to South Pacific nations such as Samoa, Fiji, Tonga and the Cook Islands.

Passports, Visas and documentation

All visitors who are not citizens of New Zealand need a passport to enter. Australian passport holders may enter New Zealand without a visa and stay as long as they wish without restrictions including on employment. British passport holders can be granted a visa-free Visitor’s Permit for up to six months on arrival. Citizens of a large number of other countries can be granted a visa-free visitor’s entry for up to three months on arrival, check the list of Visa Free Countries [1]. All these waivers, including the one for Australians, can be refused. In particular, potential visitors with criminal records or who have been refused entry to or deported from any country should check with New Zealand immigration about whether they need to apply for a visa.

Visitors from countries not in the visa-free list or those wishing to stay longer than the maximum visa-free period for their nationality, will need to apply for an appropriate visa. Check the Immigration New Zealand [2] web page for details.

Quarantine

Because the economy is based on agriculture, importing even small quantities of most food, as well as unprocessed animal or plant materials is tightly controlled. These restrictions are designed to limit the spread of animal and plant diseases and pests. New Zealand has some very strong biosecurity laws, which are taken very seriously by enforcement officials at border control. In addition, importation or possession of most recreational drugs, including cannabis, is illegal and results in instant arrest. If found guilty, you would be subject to a range of penalties from; hefty fines for minor offences to lengthy imprisonment for larger offences, after which you would be deported and prohibited from re-entering.

At ports of entry, both the Agriculture and Customs Services may inspect passenger baggage and confiscate and fine heavily for any prohibited items. This would include, for example, a New Zealand grown apple you were given on the plane. There are air-side amnesty bins available to cater for accidental importation. Items that must be declared include: any kind of food; any plant material; any animals, animal material or biological specimens; dirty or soiled sports gear, footwear, and used camping gear and anything that may have been in contact with soil, been used on a farm or has been used with animals. If travelling with golf clubs and shoes, make sure you clean them before your trip. It is also a good idea to remove spikes from your golf shoes. Expect random inspections by sniffer-dogs–you may need to have your luggage inspected if you have had food in it recently that the dogs can smell.

Commercially-packaged or processed food is usually allowed through by the Agricultural services. If you are unsure it is best to declare any questionable items as the immigration officers will be able to tell you if it needs to be cleaned or disposed of before entry. Instant fines of NZD200 can be issued at the pleasure of border control staff per item if prohibited and not declared. Some items may allowable such as wooden souvenirs but be taken for sterilization or fumigation before being released to you. You are charged a nominal fee for these processes before they are released to you.

If not declared, or the quarantine section of the arrival card is not correctly completed, an instant fine of at least $200 is often freely applied. If you have difficulty with the arrival card, most airline staff are able to assist you, there are also officials at the major airports air-side who can assist. More serious breaches may result in a fine of up to $100,000 or a prison term of up to five years. Either declare items as required or dump them in the amnesty bins before you reach customs.

Get around

By air

 
 Departure Fee 

Before leaving New Zealand any passenger over the age of 12 on any flight is required to pay NZ$22 – NZ$25 at the airport. This fee can be paid by credit card.
 

Domestic flights in New Zealand are quite reasonably priced, and are often cheaper than driving or taking the train, especially if crossing between the North and South Islands is required.

Most airlines operate an electronic ticket system. You can book on-line via the Internet or by telephone or through a travel agent. Pay using a credit card and just turn up on the day, although the card and photographic ID will be needed to prove identification. However, you should also bring a copy of your itinerary to serve as proof of your planned departure for the purposes of securing a travel visa.

Check-in times are usually 30 minutes prior to flight departure. Cabin baggage and personal scanning are routinely conducted for services from the major airports that have jet landings.

 Air New Zealand , [3]. Has the most extensive domestic network, serving most cities over 20,000 people, with jet services between main centres and smaller aircraft elsewhere. Free baggage allowance is 20 kg, with 5 kg carry-on. Qantas , [4]. Operated by Jetconnect and flies on the main trunk and principal tourist routes (Auckland–Rotorua–Wellington–Christchurch–Queenstown) Pacific Blue , [www.flypacificblue.co.nz]. Have recently launched in New Zealand, offering a few internal routes but perhaps more importantly breaking the duopoly and driving down prices through competition. 

Only Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown and Wellington airports have timetabled public transport in the form of buses. Regional airports generally have only on-demand shuttle services and taxis.

By land

For responsible eco-conscious travel, the transport you choose while you move around and explore New Zealand will be of interest to you.

 Landcare Research , [5], New Zealand’s foremost environmental research organisation, has conducted independent research into carbon footprints and found that using modern coach transport will create up to a 90% lower carbon footprint than driving yourself in a modern 2.0 litre motor vehicle. (Note: This is unlikely to apply to older coaches.)

Bike

You can bring your own bike, as well as hire a bike in some of the larger cities. You must wear a helmet while riding, otherwise you may be fined. When hiring a bike you should be supplied with a helmet. Also remember to ride on the left.

Riding bikes in New Zealand can be fun, but be aware of buses and trucks on main highways as overtaking distances can be slim. You should also be prepared for the large distances between towns and cities and the generally windy weather. While some areas of New Zealand are flat, most tourists cycling in New Zealand will find that they need to be able to cope with long periods of cycling up hills, especially in the Coromandel.

Being a temperate coastal climate, the weather is changeable and it is recommended that cyclists have all options covered. It is often said that in New Zealand you can get four seasons in one day, particularly in the high country which has been made famous as the film location of Middle Earth in the filmed versions of Lord of the Rings. Due to ozone depletion above NZ and Australia, burn times in the summer are often shorter relative to elsewhere in the world, and a factor 15 or greater sunscreen is essential to avoid the discomfort of sunburn.

Flying with your bike can be expensive and problematic with limiting weight restrictions and many cyclist choose to get a bike on their arrival to New Zealand. This offers the additional benefit of not being stuck with a bike when you take on other activities, such as walking, and saves the tricky job of repacking for flights. Christchurch has the largest number of guided and self-guided tour operators [6] and there are a number of bike rental companies based there also.

Bus

Buses are a relatively cheap and environmentally friendly way to get around New Zealand. Most roads in New Zealand are quite narrow and winding, and travelling a long distance in a bus can be a safe and relaxing way to travel.

 Flying Kiwi Adventure Tours , [7]. New Zealand’s original adventure tour company, with a range of New Zealand Tour Options ranging from 3–27 days and covering both islands. The trips are outdoor focused with food, transport, accommodation and even boogie boards included. There are options to hop and off, bikes available to hire, and free hikes everyday, in addition to a range of optional activities such as dolphin swimming, whale watching and more. Offers a number of tour discounts and specials on their site. 

 InterCity Coachlines, [8]. New Zealand’s national coach company, with services connecting over 600 destinations nationwide. InterCity Group has voluntarily adopted European Emission standards across its fleet of modern coaches to operate InterCity Coachlines, Newmans Coach Lines and also operates a modern fleet of vessels and coaches to operate Kings Dolphin Cruises&amp;Eco Tours in the Bay of Islands . In May 2007 InterCity Group singed up to Landcare Research’s carboNZero programme [9] which has a core focus on working to reduce harmful emissions at source. They have used a range of activities to reduce their carbon emissions by up to 50% over the 5 years.  edit 

 Naked Bus Bookings on the website: [10], provides daily point-to-point services with very low prices. You may be able to find $1 advance tickets on their website. Their services cover the country with daily buses. Naked Bus is the cheapest option for travellers who plan ahead–even if you book at the last minute their prices are often cheaper than other operators. 

 Great Sights , [11]. This sister company of Intercity Coach provides daily sightseeing tours to all major tourist destinations in both North and South Islands including the Bay of Islands, Waitomo Caves, Rotorua, Mt Cook, Milford Sound and the West coast Glaciers of Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers. 

 Flexi-Pass [12]–InterCity/Newmans also offer a pass. Flexi-Pass is sold in blocks of time, just like a prepaid phone card, and enables the holder to travel anywhere on the company’s network. Passes start at 15hrs, which is enough to travel from Auckland to Wellington in the North Island. Flexi-Pass hours can also be used to travel on the Interislander ferry [13] and on Great Sights Bay of Islands Dolphin Watching cruises and tours [14] to Cape Brett and the famous&quot;Hole in the Rock&quot;. 

 In the South Island there are a number of small bus companies like Atomic Shuttles who operate a no-frills shuttle service. 

 Backpacker buses –KiwiExperience Backpacker Bus [15], Stray Travel Bus [16] and The Magic Bus [17] offer bus trips around New Zealand where you can get on and off as you please. 

Private tours

New Zealand Splendeur Tours [18] offers fully inclusive limousine tours covering the entire country.

Campervan

See also: Renting a motorhome in New Zealand 

Car

See also: Driving in New Zealand 

Driving around both the main islands by car is generally not a problem. You can reach almost anywhere you might need to in a two-wheel-drive car or even a small camper van. You do not need four-wheel drive to reach the best places. The volume of traffic is normally low and drivers are usually fairly courteous. Within the cities, traffic density is higher and some confusion may set in, given that many drivers are used to the open roads. Traffic moves on the left in New Zealand, just like in Australia/UK/Japan but unlike North America/continental Europe/mainland China, so be sure to stay on the correct side of the road if you drive.

To legally drive in New Zealand then you need to be at least 15 years of age and hold a valid drivers licence from your home country. It’s important to note that if you plan on staying and driving in country for over a year then you need to get a New Zealand driver’s licence.

Rideshare

Rideshare and carpooling is increasing in New Zealand as petrol prices rise and people recognise the social and environmental benefit of sharing vehicles and travelling with others. While some systems are quite informal, others have trust systems which give greater security when choosing a ride.

 Cooreea , [19]. A New Zealand company, Cooreea provides a comprehensive trust based system and allows pre-arranged payments between users. Payments are held until successful completion of the ride. They are aiming at making peoples rideshare experience as secure, safe and easy as possible. Other than rideshare, the system is also designed for you to send things like your bicycle with someone who’s got space in their car. 

 Hitch , [20]. Another Kiwi company, is probably the biggest in the country so far. 

 Carpool , [21]. The oldest carpool site in New Zealand. It does not seem to have many listings useful to travellers being more aimed at commuters. 

Rental

Car rental firms range from the familiar multi-national big brands through to small local car rental firms. The advantage of the big name rental firms is they can be found throughout New Zealand and offer the biggest and newest range of rental vehicles. The disadvantage is that generally they are the most expensive. Occasionally rental firms offer free rental in the direction from south to north due to the majority of tourists travelling in the opposite direction, creating a deficit of cars in the north.

At the other end of the scale are the small local operators who typically have older rental cars. Whilst you may not end up driving this year’s latest model the advantage is that the smaller car rental firms can be substantially cheaper, so leaving you more money to spend on the many exciting attractions New Zealand offers. Between these extremes you will find a wide range of NZ car rental firms catering to different needs and budgets.

Self drive holidays are a great way to travel around New Zealand as they offer independence, flexibility and opportunities to interact with the locals. A number of companies offer inclusive self drive holidays with rental car&amp;accommodation, pre-set itineraries or customised to suit your interests.

Purchase

If you want to have a low cost holiday greater than about 2 weeks in New Zealand, and you would prefer to have your own transport then the best solution is to buy your own car/van. Upon arriving in the country, you would purchase a low cost vehicle which you sell just before leaving. Note that if you use this method travel across Cook Straight can be expensive, if you are going super-low budget (purchasing a car for say NZ$500 or less) it would be wiser to buy and sell a car in each island separately. In addition to the usual ways to look for a car (newspapers, accommodation noticeboards etc) New Zealand’s biggest online auction website Trademe[22] has many listings.

The following things need to be checked in order to safely purchase a vehicle in New Zealand:

 there is no debt on the vehicle. In NZ, if a loan of money is used to purchase a vehicle, then the debt is associated with that vehicle even if it is sold, in which case the new owner then has the problem of the debt. Selling a vehicle with debt associated with it in NZ is illegal. Checking for debt is an easy process as a central register is kept. 

 the vehicle has not been stolen. Contact the police with the registration plate and VIN (vehicle identification number). 

 legally, the vehicle must have a Warrant of Fitness valid for at least 30 days (unless advertised&quot;as is, where is&quot;). The expiry date will be written on the inside of the car window sticker. 

 the Registration expiration date is not in the past. This label is usually on the left side of the car window. 

 the vehicle needs a physical check for faults, there are companies in main centres that provide this service. 

Insurance

Car insurance is not compulsory in New Zealand but at least third party insurance is recommended. Diesel vehicles have additional requirements, as diesel is significantly cheaper than petrol but there are additional charges based on distance travelled. When you sell a vehicle it is very important to go to a Postshop outlet to record the transfer otherwise any subsequent speeding fines, parking tickets etc will be recorded in your name.

Motorcycle

New Zealand is the motorbike rider’s dream country! Motorcycle rentals of many makes are available throughout New Zealand.

 South Pacific Motorcycles [23]offer both motorbike rental (Harley-Davidson, BMW, Honda&amp;other late-model motorcycles) from Christchurch as well as guided and self-guided motorcycle tours.

Thumb

Hitchhiking around New Zealand is generally possible on most inter-city and major rural roads. However, it is illegal to hitchhike on motorways and illegal for motorists to stop there to pick you up. Try to get out of the middle of town, especially where public transport operates. Wear your pack and look like you’re touring the country rather than just being a local looking for a lift. You have as much chance of being picked up by another tourist as a local, particularly in tourist areas. Alternatives for travellers include organizing shared rides through hostels, or using an online ridesharing resource like Hitch New Zealand [24] or Cooreea [25] which can make the process much safer and enjoyable. However, hitchhiking is not as safe as it used to be. In recent times, there has been the occasional case of a driver being assaulted and robbed by a hitchhiker they picked up and/or the car being hijacked. It is also dangerous for the hitchhikers, as there have been cases of hitchhikers being assaulted, raped and even murdered by their drivers. Hitchhiking in New Zealand for this reason is not recommended.

By rail

Both Auckland and Wellington have commuter rail services. These services are operated by Veolia [26] in Auckland and Tranz Metro [27] in Greater Wellington.

Inter-city rail passenger services are operated by Tranz Scenic [28], but have become increasingly limited due to the dysfunctional services, and the focus is now on popular tourist trains. However the remaining train services pass through spectacular scenery and have a running commentary, panoramic windows and an open-air viewing carrige.

 The Overlander –between Auckland and Wellington, departing each city in the morning, daily in summer, Friday-Sunday the rest of the year has been retained in the mean time but could be cancelled in the near future. The Capital Connection –Commuter service leaves from Palmerston North to Wellington in the morning, returning in the evening. The TranzCoastal –from Christchurch to Picton (via Kaikoura) and return daily. Travels along the rugged north-east coast of the South Island. Meets the Picton-Wellington ferry. The TranzAlpine –from Christchurch to Greymouth and return daily. Classed as one of the world’s great train journeys, this trip crosses the South Island, passing through spectacular mountain scenery, some of which is inaccessible by road, as well as the 12 km Otira tunnel. Many visitors disembark at Arthur’s Pass National Park and spend four hours exploring the mountains before catching the return train. 

Trains run at low speed, sometimes dropping to 50 km/h in the summer due to the lack of track maintenance following privatisation in the 1990s. Most New Zealanders prefer to drive or fly, as train fares are comparatively expensive. Trains are more suited to tourists as they are more scenic and more comfortable than other forms of travel.

By water

To get your car between the North and South Islands you will need to take a ferry across Cook Strait. There are several sailings daily between Wellington and Picton. But be prepared for a delay or a change in sailings if the weather is stormy.

Harbour ferries, for commuters, operate in Auckland and Wellington. A number of communities are served by boat, rather than road, while charter boats are available for expeditions in several places. There are regular sightseeing cruises in several tourist destinations, particularly in the Southern Lakes and Fiordland area.

For thrills, there is the New Zealand-designed jet boat. You can even travel on the very rivers that inspired this craft.

 Just like the movies 

Many movies and television series have been filmed in New Zealand. Some of the more notable examples are listed below:

 Goodbye Pork Pie (1981)–road trip between Kaitaia in the far north to Invercargill in the deep south River Queen (2006)–Wanganui The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03)–numerous locations throughout the country Whale Rider (2003)–the North Island’s East Coast The Last Samurai (2003)–Taranaki Once Were Warriors (1994)–Auckland The Piano (1993)–west coast of the Auckland region Power Rangers television series (since 2003)- in and around Auckland The Quiet Earth (1987)–Waikato University–Hamilton, Warkworth Transmitter Station Xena television series–west Auckland region The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)–alpine grassland and glaciers around Flock Hill Station in the Southern Alps near Christchurch, and other places. King Kong (2005)–Wellington The World’s Fastest Indian (2005)–Invercargill 
 

New Zealand scenery has long been a major tourist attraction, so spectacular it leaves many lost for words. You need to see it to understand, just describing it is not enough. Mind you, if you have seen some recent movies that were made in New Zealand, you probably have seen it and not realized. Those spectacular landscapes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy are based on New Zealand scenery. Sure they were computer enhanced, but only in places, and the real scenery is still there to be visited. Selected highlights are:

 Fiordland and Milford Sound–they built the road here, including a tunnel under the mountains, just for the tourists. Queenstown on the shores of Lake Wakatipu and with the other Southern Lakes in easy reach. Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers–in the Westland region. Mount Cook–New Zealand’s highest mountain, in the heart of the Southern Alps. The Canterbury plains. Mount Ruapehu and Lake Taupo–volcanoes with lakes in them. White Island, one of New Zealand’s more active volcanoes. Bay of Islands, where the Waitangi treaty house can be found and the place where New Zealand’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi , was signed. The copies are now held by the Archives New Zealand in Wellington. Ninety Mile Beach New Zealand Webcam [29]

Talk

 English , Maori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages of New Zealand. English is universal, and is written with Commonwealth (British) spelling.

New Zealand English is one of the major varieties of English and is different enough from other forms to justify the publication of the Oxford New Zealand English dictionary. A seldom-used expression for New Zealand English is Newzild.

Word usage may also differ occasionally, in potentially embarrassing ways for the traveller. Several words that Americans may consider offensive, or have euphemisms for, are considered acceptable usage. For example: A New Zealand bathroom refers to a room containing a bath while the other facilities that an American might refer to as a bathroom or washroom are known as a toilet . The American habit of&quot;bleeping&quot;swear words from broadcasts is considered quaint and rarely done in local programming. The New Zealand broadcasting media are unusually tolerant of swear words when used in context.

The New Zealand accent is somewhat nasalised with flattened vowel sounds and vowel shifting. New Zealanders consider their accent to be markedly different from the Australian one and are often mildly offended when mistaken for or confused with Australians. New Zealand terminology and slang are also different from Australian usage. Americans find New Zealand accents easy to understand, so do Australians and British. Some European dialects find it slightly harder and Asians may find it rather hard to understand; New Zealanders are quite happy however to repeat what they just said if necessary.

 Maori is actively spoken by a minority of both Maori and language learners. Maori is available as a language to study in, instead of English, at many educational institutes. The Maori language is spoken by some, but not all, Maori and a few non-Maori, especially in the far north and east of the North Island. Many place names are in Maori and for the traveller some knowledge of Maori pronunciation is very useful.

New Zealand Sign language was given status in 2005 as an official language of the country.

Common expressions

Generally, New Zealand English expressions follows British English. However, New Zealand English has also borrowed much from Maori and there are a number of other phrases that are not commonly encountered elsewhere or may confuse the visitor.

 Bach (pron.&quot;batch&quot;)–Holiday home; often by the beach and comprising of fairly basic accommodation. In the South Island often called a crib. 

 Bring a plate –(see also;&quot;Ladies a plate&quot;) means each attendant of the event should bring a plate of food to share with the other guests. 

 BYO –Bring Your Own. An addition to the name of a restaurant that may not have a liquor licence. Means that it is perfectly okay to bring your own wine to enjoy with your food, but they often charge a small corkage fee. 

 Clayton’s –Describing something as a Clayton’s means that the item lacks full functionality or is a poor imitation of the real thing. From the name of the unsuccessful non-alcoholic whisky that was briefly marketed during the late 1970s/early 1980s under the catch phrase The drink you’re having when you are not having a drink. 

 Dairy –Convenience store; corner shop, one few outsiders understand though heavily used by locals and find problems when travelling overseas and are surprised when asking where the dairy is. 

 Entry by gold (or silver) coin (donation) –The admission charge to an event, exhibit, gallery or museum is by making a payment of a coin in the appropriate metal, often in the donation box at the door. The gold coins in NZ are the $1 and $2 coins, while silver are the 20c and 50c coins, and the 10c coin is copper. (See also&quot;Koha&quot;below). 

 Half Pie –Usually a job or task not performed to satisfaction (cf Maori Pai = good) 

 Kiwi –Slang for a New Zealander and also for the New Zealand dollar, named after an endangered flightless bird that lays the largest egg relative to body size and is the national emblem. This is not a derogatory term and any New Zealander will happily refer to themselves as a‘Kiwi’. 

 Ladies a plate –At social functions, such as meetings, attendees are expected to bring a plate carrying ready-to-eat food. Typically the food is home baking by a member of each attending family or couple, not necessarily a&quot;lady&quot;. 

 Glidetime –Flexible working hours, often worked by public servants. Under this system, workers can start and finish work at hours of their choosing between 7 am and 6 pm, although they must work the core hours of 9.30 am to noon and 2 pm to 3.30 pm and average 40 hours per week. Also the name of a comedy play about such workers. 

 Social welfare –State operated organisations responsible for child protection services, income assistance and work placement for the unemployed. 

 Beneficiary –A person of working age who is receiving state welfare assistance payments known as income support or a benefit . 

 Superannuitants –Retired people in receipt of a state retirement pension known as New Zealand Superannuation –usually abbreviated to just&quot;Super&quot;. This payment is paid to all citizens over 65 years old. 

Slang expressions

 Sweet as! –Cool, good thing, No problem. 

 Choice! –Cool, great. 

 Eh? –&quot;Isn’t it?&quot;Often ends a North Islander’s sentence without any specific meaning. 

 Cool bananas! –&quot;It’s good.&quot; 

 Bro –Short for brother but used by males to address other males. 

Maori words and expressions

 Kia Ora –Hello, welcome, literally good health. Often used as an utterance of agreement, especially during speaking at a hui. 

 Haere Mai –A greeting to a person arriving, while Haere Ra is a salutation to one leaving. 

 Hui –A meeting or gathering to discuss and debate issues in traditional Maori fashion. 

 Iwi –A Maori tribe or people, sometimes known as a Waka (canoe), as some iwi are named after the ocean going canoes that brought their ancestors to New Zealand. 

 Koha –A Maori term for gifts or donations. Often an exchange of gifts takes place. (Sometimes the admission signs say,&quot;Entry Koha&quot;, meaning gold coin or what you feel like donating.) 

 Kai –Food. Common with both Maori and European. 

 Marae –A traditional Maori meeting or gathering place. Also a community centre. 

 Pakeha –The Maori word for European New Zealanders, generally thought to have arisen from a Maori story about white creatures called‘pakepakeha’. Some European New Zealanders do not refer to themselves as Pakeha, while others see the name as part of their unique identity. Many liberal whites will even call themselves Pakeha to distinguish them from Europeans as whites in New Zealand are referred to as Europeans but are usually of fourth or fifth generation New Zealander. 

 Powhiri –A Maori ceremonial welcome. Especially to a marae, but now also may take place at the start of a conference or similar large meeting in New Zealand. 

 Whanau –A Maori (extended) family. Kinfolk. 

 Wharenui –literally big house , is the meeting house on a marae. Used often in advertising to alliterate with friends such as‘friends and whanau’. 

 Wharekai –literally food house , is the dining room and/or kitchen on a marae. 

 Wharepaku –literally Small house or more tongue in cheek&quot;Explode House&quot;,–Toilet 

Buy

One thing of note is that the smallest coin is 10c, since New Zealand reduced the size of its silver (cent) coins in 2006, and eliminated the 5c piece. The 10c piece is a coppery colour similar to a US or UK penny. The 20c piece is silver with a Maori carving depicted, as is the 50c piece with captain James Cook’s ship the Endeavour. The gold $1 features a kiwi, whilst the $2 features a heron. There are notes for $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100.

On Christmas day, Easter Sunday and Anzac day morning on 25th April all but a few essential businesses must be closed. While many traders flout this regulation, the matter has for many years been being reviewed by the government. If you are in New Zealand on one of these days, ensure you have all your needs met prior to the date.

Electronic banking/purchasing

New Zealanders are amongst the highest users of electronic banking services in the world. Automatic teller machines (ATMs), locally known as‘the hole in the wall’, are available in just about every town, even those without a bank. Most shops have Eftpos (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale) terminals for debit and credit cards, so most purchases can be made electronically. Credit cards are not accepted by some merchants with Eftpos, especially smaller food retailers such as dairies, takeaways and cafes that do not serve alcohol. Also smaller retailers may often set a minimum purchase of around $10 when obtaining cash, if they agree to provide cash. Banks offer a wide range of telephone and Internet banking services. If you are going to be in New Zealand for a while it may be convenient to open a New Zealand bank account and set up a local debit card, to avoid carrying a lot of cash around.

Price negotiation

Because of strong advertising laws, the displayed price is normally the purchase price for most goods sold in New Zealand. The principle The price stated is the price you pay is strongly ingrained in New Zealand culture.

Most retailers will not negotiate on price, though some have a formal policy of matching the competition and will match or even discount their prices for you if you can find a better price for the exact same product elsewhere. However, this seems to be changing as there are stories about people finding appliance and electronics stores very willing to negotiate on price in order to get business, especially if you’re looking at high-end items or have a shopping list of multiple high-priced items. Some places you have to ask for a discount, while others have salespeople that offer discounts on pricey goods as soon as they approach you.

Taxes and fees

Unless it says otherwise the price includes GST (Goods and Services Tax, or sales tax) of 12.5%. Some shops, especially in tourist destinations, will ship purchases overseas, as export goods which are not subject to GST. Ask about this service before making your purchase. Goods purchased and taken with you will be subject to GST. You can claim GST back on items to the value of more than $700 at the time of your departure as if you were exporting them. You must have the items and receipts with you. You should allow extra time air-side of the airport to process this transaction.

On public holidays, some establishments such as cafes may charge a holiday surcharge in the region of 15%, supposedly to cover the cost of employing staff who are working on the holiday. This is a recent development because current holiday legislation requires workers who work on public holidays to be paid at one-and-a-half times their normal wage and be given a equal time off in lieu as a minimum. The legality of this surcharge is questionable if not advertised openly or notified at the time of placing an order and should be challenged.

Tipping

In lodgings, restaurants and bars the prices charged include the services provided and tips are not expected, though the practice is known of in some establishments that cater for tourists. However, do not be surprised if you receive bemused looks in some situations. Also do not be offended if your tip is initially refused or questioned, as most New Zealanders rarely encounter tipping, except from tourists. New Zealanders’unfamiliarity with tipping makes many of them very ill-at-ease with it when travelling in countries where it is practised. It is viewed very negatively by New Zealanders as an alien vulgarity, being made to‘pay twice’, or as a form of bribery. Staff in some establishments may risk their job in accepting a tip. In the major cities, tipping tends to be embraced by workers, especially over the summer when students wait tables for part-time work, but a source of annoyance to older kiwis. Tipjars may be placed on counters, but these are for loose change and you are not expected to place coins in them. It is common practice and polite to donate your spare change from the meal to what ever charity has a collection jar on the counter, and this acts as the standard substitute for tipping.

Eat

New Zealand has a wide range of eating places, from fast food outlets to stylish restaurants. Many petrol stations have a convenience store with sandwiches or food such as pies that can be microwaved on-site. Fast food chains include KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, Pizza Hut and Subway. There are also many independent, owner-operated takeaways outlets selling one or more of burgers, pizzas, fried chicken, Chinese or other Asian fast food or fish and chips. At least a burger bar and/or fish and chip shop can be found in almost any small town or block of suburban shops. The humble fish and chip shop is the archetypical New Zealand fast food outlet. The menu consists of battered fish portions deep fried in oil together with chunky cut potato chips as well as a range of other meats, seafood, pineapple rings and even chocolate bars, all wrapped in newsprint paper-today it is unprinted but traditionally it was yesterday’s newspaper, until someone decided it was unhealthy. A good meal can often be had for under $5, a bad one for the same price.

Cuisine

New Zealand’s cultural majority, mainly British, do not have a definitive and recognisably distinct cuisine that differs markedly from the traditional British cuisine. However there are a number of small differences

 Roast kumara –the sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas ) roasted in the same manner as potatoes and often served instead of or alongside. May also be deep fried like potato chips and known as kumara chips –nice served with sour cream but rarely done well as kumara cooks at a different temperature than potatoes, so it needs a skilled chef for the dish to be done perfectly. Pavlova , or pav , a cake of whipped egg whites baked to have a crusty meringue-like outside but soft in the middle, topped with whipped cream and decorated with sliced fruit. The dessert is also common in Australia. ANZAC biscuits –Plain hard biscuits made primarily from oatmeal bound with golden syrup. Originally made for and by ANZAC troops during the First World War. Also found in Australia. Pies –New Zealanders eat large numbers of non-flakey-pastry meat pies containing things like beef, lamb, pork, potato, kumara, vegetables, and cheese. Some companies now market ranges of&quot;gourmet&quot;pies and there is an annual competition for the best pie in a variety of catagories. Kiwifruit –A plum-sized green fleshed fruit, with fine black seeds in the flesh, originating from China, selectively bred in New Zealand, and first known to the home gardener as the Chinese Gooseberry . Now commercially farmed, with production centred on Te Puke but in many orcharding areas. Slices often served on pavlova. Known by its full name of kiwifruit and never shortened to kiwi in New Zealand, as kiwis are endangered birds or New Zealanders. Whitebait –The translucent sprat or fingerlings of native freshwater fish species that migrate from spawning in the sea each year. After being caught in coastal river mouth set or hand nets during November/December, this highly sought after delicacy is rushed to all ends of the country. Served in a fried pattie made from an egg based batter. May be seasonally available from a local fish and chip shop. Is served without gutting or deheading. 

The Maori also have a distinctive cuisine…

 The hangi or earth oven is the traditional way that Maori cook food for large gatherings. Meat, vegetables and sometimes puddings are slowly steam-cooked for several hours in a covered pit that has previously been lined with stones and had a hot wood fire burn down in it. Kaimoana (literally: sea food )–particularly shellfish gathered from inter-tidal rocks and beaches as well as crayfish (rock lobster) and inshore fish caught on a line or with nets. Species such as paua (blackfoot abalone) and toheroa have been overfished and gathering restrictions are strictly enforced, while green mussels are commercially grown and sold live, or processed, in supermarkets. WARNING While it is almost extremely common to see people collecting shellfish, crustaceans and other kaimoana , there are a number of rules one must be aware of. often these are posted on signs at the approaches to the collecting area. If in doubt, check with a local. Rules may be seasonal or all-year catch limits set by the Ministry of Fisheries, or they may be that certain areas are reserved solely for tangata whenua , or a combination. Also at times areas may have a prohibition against them for health reasons. 

Drink

New Zealanders have a reputation for enjoying their beer. Although there are now only three major breweries, there are many regional brands, each with their own distinctive taste and staunch supporters.

More recently, the wine industry has developed into a significant export industry. Many vineyards now offer winery tours, wine tasting and sales from the vineyard.

Take care when and where you indulge in public. New Zealand has recently introduced liquor ban areas–that means alcoholic drinks cannot be consumed or even carried in some streets, such as city centres and popular beaches, at certain times of the day or night. Police can instruct you to empty bottles and arrest you if you do not comply.

Coffeehouses are a daytime venue in many of the larger cities and tourist destinations. The cafe culture is notable in downtown Wellington, where many office workers have their tea breaks. Most coffee styles, cappuccino, latte, espresso/short black, long black, flat white, vienna etc, are usually available. Cappuccinos are probably the most popular and are usually served with a choice of cinnamon or chocolate powder sprinkled on top. Its usual to request which one you want. Fluffies are a small frothed milk for children, sprinkled with chocolate powder.

Bottled water, both flavoured and unflavoured, available in most shops. Not that there is anything wrong with the tap water, it is just that some town supplies are drawn from river water and chlorinated. Most town supplies are fluoridated. If you do not want to pour your money down the drain, fill your own water bottle from the tap, unless you find it is too heavily chlorinated for your taste.

Tap water in New Zealand is regarded as some of the cleanest in the world; it is safe to drink from in all cities, most come from artesian wells or freshwater reservoirs–however, some are from rivers which can be chlorinated to be made safe but do not taste very nice. Some of the water in Auckland comes from the Waikato river, a long river that has its source in Lake Taupo in the centre of the North Island. But by the time it reaches Auckland, it has been treated so that the quality is no worse than that of the Thames in London or the Hudson in New York. Auckland water is also drawn from run-off reservoirs in the Waitakere and Hunua Ranges. Tap water in places such as Christchurch and Hastings is not chlorinated at all as it is drawn from the pure artesian aquifers of the Canterbury and Heretaunga plains.

 L&amp;P or Lemon&amp;Paeroa is&quot;world famous in New Zealand&quot;. It is a sweet carbonated lemonade style drink sold in a brown plastic bottle with a yellow label because they used to sell it in brown glass ones before they switched to plastic. Generally one for the kids or parties as it mixes quite well with whisky, though the big bottle in Paeroa itself is a hit with the tourists. It is now manufactured in Auckland by Coca-Cola.

Sleep

New Zealand offers a wide range of accommodation.

International quality hotels can be found in the major cities. And New Zealanders seem to have perfected the art of the top-end homestay. Hosted luxury lodges are the top-end equivalent of the bed-and-breakfast market and New Zealand has upwards of 40 internationally recognised lodges. Per capita, that’s probably the highest in the world. They tend to be situated away from cities, though some are right in the heart of the major centres, and can be difficult to get to. At the very top-end, helicopter transfers and private jets help the luxury traveller move between the lodges they’ve chosen for their visit.

 Motels of a variety of standards from luxury to just adequate can be found on the approaches to most towns.

There is a wide range of backpackers accommodation around the country, including a network of Youth Hostels that are members of the Youth Hostels Association (62 in 2004).

Bed and Breakfasts are popular with visiting Brits and Swiss as well as homestays , farmstays and similar lodgings–some of which are in the most unlikely places.

For uniquely New Zealand accommodation, there are Maori homestays and tourist-catering marae stays.

There are a number of commercial camping grounds around the country, as well as camping sites within all of the national parks. One way that many tourists travel around New Zealand is in a self-contained campervan , a motorised caravan or large minibus, that can be driven by anyone who holds an ordinary car driver’s licence.

If you are travelling into the backcountry, the Department of Conservation has many backcountry huts that can be used under a permit system.

Free camping is also available in many places. Unless there is a&quot;no camping&quot;sign it is common to find a tent or hammock pitched for the night in many picnic areas or in a grove of trees off the road. Cycle tourists especially will rarely need to pay for camping, only for showers and laundry. Multi-day camping in these areas is often frowned upon, and in conservation areas camping outside designated areas may attract a fine.

New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world after the UK to develop a dense WWOOF [38] network. WWOOF is a world wide network where travellers (&quot;WWOOFers&quot;) stay as volunteers on farms and receive food and accommodation in exchange for half a days help for each night they stay. The Nelson Tasman region [39] in the South Island is particularly rich in WWoOFing possibilities.

Learn

For many years, New Zealand schools and universities have educated foreign students from the countries of Southeast Asia and education has now become a major source of export earnings for the country. In recent years English language schools have been established for students from the region, particularly South Korea and China, but also many other countries.

Education in New Zealand is compulsory from age 6 to 16 years, though almost all children begin attending school at age 5 and often stay at school for 13 years, until 17 or 18 years old. Primary schooling is from Year 1-6 (formerly J1–Standard 4), intermediate schooling is Year 7 and 8 (formerly forms one and two), while secondary schooling is from Year 9-13 (formerly forms 3 to 7). In some primary and secondary schools one or both of the intermediate years may be combined with either the primary or secondary years. There are also Middle Schools which cover the intermediate years and the first two years of secondary, but these are rare.

Secondary schools are also called high schools (generally Years 9-13) and colleges (generally Years 7-13). A college does not refer to universities in New Zealand unlike in some other countries, though some specialised single-subject tertiary training-centres may also be called colleges .

Primary, intermediate and secondary compulsory schooling is free for citizens and permanent residents, although some nominal fees are generally charged to cover consumable materials. Tertiary education is state assisted, with part of the tuition costs funded by the state. International students will need to pay for their education; in some cases this includes a national profit margin.

The Ministry of Education has established a Code of Practice that New Zealand educational institutions enrolling international students need to abide by. This Code of Practice includes minimum standards for the‘PC‘pastoral care of international students. Primary school students, or those age 10 or under, need to either live with a parent or else board in a school hostel. Additionally, older students, who are under age 18, may live in homestays, temporary accommodation or with designated caregivers. Where the institution arranges accommodation for students older than age 18 the code of practice applies to their accommodation situations also. 

New Zealand citizens, permanent residents and refugees can receive financial assistance through loans and allowances, to pay the tuition fees and to attend tertiary education at Universities , Polytechnics , Whananga (Maori operated universities/polytechnics) and Private Training Providers . Overseas students will need to pay the full tuition fees and their own living costs while studying at a New Zealand institution.

Overseas students need to have a student visa and a reasonable level of cash to spend in order to undertake a course of study at a New Zealand based educational institution. Visas are generally valid for the duration of the course of study and only while the student is attending the course of study. New Zealand educational institutions will inform the appropriate immigration authorities if a student ceases to attend their enrolled courses, who may then suspend or cancel that student’s visa. Educational institutions often also exchange this enrollment and attendance data electronically with other government agencies responsible for providing student assistance.

Work

To work in New Zealand you need to be a citizen or current permanent resident of either New Zealand or Australia, or else have a work permit or appropriate visa. If you are intending to work in New Zealand you should obtain a work permit along with any tourist visas you might apply for.

You will also need to have a New Zealand bank account , as most employers pay using electronic banking rather than in cash; an Inland Revenue Tax Number , as witholding tax or income tax will be deducted from your wages by your employer; and a tax declaration form , as tax will be deducted at the no declaration rate of 45% unless you have a tax code. More information about New Zealand’s tax system, including appropriate forms, can be obtained from Inland Revenue [40].

The process of applying for an IRD number is between 8-10 working days. You will need to fill in the IRD number application form, and provide a photocopy of a passport or New Zealand birth certificate. It is possible to apply for the IRD number, then call the department around a week later to request the number by phone, however this will depend on the workload of the processing centres at the time. Calling the IRD requires several forms of ID, it is ideal to be able to provide your passport number and full address when requested.

New Zealand operates a simplified tax system that tends to collect more tax than people need to pay because employers pay their worker’s tax when they pay their workers. The obligation is then on the worker to claim overpaid tax back, rather than declaring their income and paying any extra tax. Be careful though, if you choose to work in New Zealand and you stay more than 183 days in any 12-month period, your worldwide income could be taxed. New Zealand has double taxation agreements with several countries to stop tax being paid twice. A safe rule of thumb is to pay all tax demands and Not seek claims for redress on any matter.

Being a foreigner means that your New Zealand income is subject to local income tax at the fullest levels. Although many people believe that they can collect all their tax back when they leave the country, this is not true. It may be the case that filing an income tax return may result in a small refund if only working for part of the year, however this is not likely the case. Tax in all its forms in New Zealand amounts to around half of a worker’s income.

Short term

New Zealand is currently (2007) experiencing a period of full employment as it experiences a higher than average migration churn when compared to other OECD countries. Therefore many positions can not be filled and a number of employers are having difficulties finding workers, particularly short term workers and businesses often cite this as a restriction on further growth. A good starting point for interested job-seekers is: [41]

Seasonal work such as fruit picking and other agricultural work is sometimes available for tourists such as backpackers formally but always available illegally. More information about legal seasonal fruit picking work can be found at Pick NZ [42].

New Zealand has a number of reciprocal Working Holiday Schemes, which allow people between 18 and 30 to travel and work in New Zealand for up to one year and vice versa. At present young citizens of a number of countries from Europe, South America, North America and Asia can apply. These schemes are enormously popular and in many instances participants can apply to stay in New Zealand longer once they have completed their one year stay. Information on all the various schemes and application details can be found at: [43]

Long term

If you want to stay in New Zealand long term, you should apply well ahead of time. New Zealand operates a points system for assessing applicants.

Refugee applications should be made before arrival since NZ has a formal refugee induction programme.

Those who turn up in a New Zealand airport arrival lounge without papers, claiming refugee status, may find themselves put on a return flight to their country of origin or in jail awaiting the outcome of legal proceedings.

Volunteering

Volunteering is a great way to get to meet locals and see the island, National Parks and nature reserves of New Zealand. You can speak with the local Department of Conservation office about volunteering opportunities or choose from any number of worldwide organizations that offer extended travel for anyone willing to volunteer their time to work with locals on projects such as community development, conservation, wildlife sanctuary maintenance&amp;development, scientific research,&amp;education programs.

Stay safe

The emergency telephone number in New Zealand is 111 . Ambulance, Fire and Police can be contacted through this service. Full instructions are on the inside front cover of every telephone book. It often is answered in the first 30 seconds after calling.

Crime and security

While difficult to make international comparisons, the level of crime in New Zealand is similar to many other western countries. Dishonesty offences, such as theft, are by far the most frequent type of crime. Travellers should take simple, sensible precautions such as putting valuables away out of sight or in a secure place and locking doors or vehicles, even in remote locations, as much of this crime is opportunistic in nature.

Violent crime is generally associated with alcohol or illicit drug consumption. Rowdy bars or drunken crowds in city centres are best avoided, especially late at night and in the early morning. New Zealanders can be somewhat lacking in a sense of humour when their country or their sporting teams are mocked by loud or drinking tourists.

There is in addition a disturbing trend for tourists to be targeted in random violent and/or sexual crimes. In recent times the northern half of the North Island has been worst affected. The chance of falling victim to such misfortune is still low. There has also been a marked rise of 25% in the last year in violent youth crime, usually driven by gang violence. Tourists are unlikely to be affected by these developments as these crimes usually take place in deprived suburbs which tourists are unlikely to visit.

The police, a national force, are generally polite and helpful. Being caught drinking and driving will result in an arrest, conviction and discharge. Police regularly conduct blitzes, often setting up screening checkpoints all around an area, including motorways.

Fixed and mobile speed cameras as well as hand held and car speed detectors are used frequently. Police have no official discretion for speeding offences and will write tickets for all vehicles caught exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 km/h (sometimes even more than only 5km/h). Police have recently upgraded their pursuit training, following a number of deaths of both offenders and innocent third parties during vehicle pursuits.

In New Zealand, armed police are highly unusual and usually rate a mention in the media. Although all police officers are trained to handle firearms, these are normally only openly carried when the situation requires such weapons, such as an armed offender. Traditionally, New Zealand police only carry batons and offender control pepper spray–Tasers are currently being trialled in Wellington and Auckland. However, first response patrols will generally have recourse to firearms locked in their vehicle.

Natural hazards

 Severe weather is by far the most common natural hazard encountered in New Zealand. Although New Zealand is not subject to the direct hit of tropical cyclones stormy weather systems from both the tropics and the polar regions can sweep across New Zealand at various times of the year. There is generally a seven to ten day cycle of a few days of wet or stormy weather followed by calmer and drier days as weather systems move across the country. The phrase four seasons in one day is a good description of New Zealand weather, which has a reputation for both changeability and unpredictability. The phrase is also a popular Kiwi song. Weather forecasts are generally reliable for overall trends and severe weather warnings should be heeded when broadcast. However both the timing and intensity of any weather events should be assessed from your own location. Simply looking out the window is probably good enough to allow you yourself to predict what the weather will be like for at least the next 15 minutes or so, according to one eminent New Zealand meterologist, though knowing that Northerlies are warm, Southerlies are cold, westerlies are rainy but warm and easterlies are humid you can predict for yourself quite accurately.

You should always seek advice from the Department of Conservation when trekking in Alpine areas. There are annual fatalities of both foreign nationals and New Zealanders caught unaware by the weather.

Other natural hazards you may encounter, though far more rarely, are:

 Strong Earthquakes –New Zealand sits astride a tectonic plate boundary and experiences large numbers (~14,000/year) of small earthquakes every year, a few (~200/year) are noticeable and the occasional one causes damage and sometimes loss of life. However, the last big one causing serious loss of life was at Napier and Hastings in 1931. The latest quake is reported by GeoNet [49]. Volcanic eruptions –New Zealand has a number of volcanoes that are classified as active or dormant. Only Mount Ruapehu and White Island have been active recently. Volcanic activity is monitored by GeoNet.
 Lahar –There is no longer an active Lahar Alert for Mount Ruapehu’s crater lake breaking through a tephra dam and flooding the Whangaehu River with a lahar . (The dam of the crater lake was punctured naturally on 19 March 2007). 
 

 There are almost no poisonous or substantially dangerous animals. The katipo and redback are the only two venomous spiders and bites from both species are extremely rare. Serious reactions are uncommon and unlikely to develop in less than three hours, though you should always seek help at your nearest hospital, medical centre, or doctor. The white-tailed spider can also deliver painful bites but is not considered dangerous to humans. [50] No large mammalian predators are present and no large predatory reptiles. Certain species of Weta can deliver a painful but harmless bite. 

Stay healthy

New Zealand has a very high level of ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer, around 40% more intense than you will find in the Mediterranean during the summer. Sunglasses and sunscreen are highly recommended, especially if you are of European descent.

Visiting the doctor will cost about NZ$50 and may vary between practices and localities. The New Zealand public hospital system is free of charge to Australian, British and New Zealand citizens but will charge other nationals for treatment received. An exception to this is in the case of any accident when the Accident Compensation Commission (ACC) will pick up the tab. Travel insurance is highly recommended.

New Zealand has high and equitable standards of professional health care comparable with Sweden or Australia. Tap water is drinkable but precautions should be taken against Giardia when tramping.

Respect

Maori culture

Maori cultural experiences are popular tourist attractions enjoyed by many, but as with any two cultures encountering one another, there is room for misunderstanding. Some tourists have found themselves more confronted than they expected by ceremonial challenges and welcomes. These are serious occasions, and chatter and laughing during rituals is not recommended. People have been attacked by their entertainers to date for appearing to not treat it with the highest sacredness. You’d best have jokes and laughs later. There will be plenty of time to relax later when the hangi is lifted.

Maori and Pakeha New Zealanders are generally on good terms, but from time to time there have been frayed relationships between the two. Enter discussion about this with politeness and caution, or, of course, not at all.

Remember also, that New Zealand is still a very young nation by many standards and its identity is still being formulated. Commenting that New Zealand is subservient to the United Kingdom is sometimes admired and other times despised, and although New Zealand coinage is adorned with British royal figures New Zealand is an independent member of the Commonwealth and saying that New Zealand is almost identical can be offensive to some.

Relationship with Australia

While Australia and New Zealand have close foreign policy ties, considerable inter-immigration, and cultures that overlap, saying New Zealanders are basically Australians will not gain you any New Zealander or Aussie friends. Although Australians and New Zealanders may seem the same to you they do not consider themselves similar at all. It is pretty much the same relationship as with Canadians and people from the United States or Irish and British. Some Australians may joke about New Zealand being another state of Australia, but that does not make it one. In many ways Australia and New Zealand have a similar outlook towards the other, with the same cliched jokes being made, Australians tend to be a little less insecure and relaxed treating abuse as less serious and fun. A common, if uncouth joke oft made by Australians is that Kiwis enjoy intimate relations with livestock, particlarly sheep. New Zealanders have been known to parrot the same joke back about Australians.

Sir Robert Muldoon, National Prime Minister from 1975-1984, is famous for saying, when responding to a question about the movement of New Zealanders to Australia&quot;New Zealanders moving to Australia have the effect of raising the IQ on both sides of the Tasman.&quot;Some New Zealanders take pride in the free-er immigration policy to disadvantaged and developing nations and comparisons between the relationships with their respective indigenous populations.

Despite the jokes about New Zealand, many Australians have a genuine affection for the‘little brother’country. This can be traced back to ANZAC, Australia and New Zealand Army Corp, participation in two world wars, particularly the Gallipoli campaign, Korea, Viet Nam, the Malaya Crisis, Timor, Solomon Islands, etc. In recent times there has been an increasing divide in politics between NZ and Australia, although this has softened with the recent change of Prime Minister and Government in Australia.

Contact

Internet

Internet access is available in cyber cafes. Many cyber cafes are not maintained properly, but there are places around that maintain a high level of security when it comes to their systems. If you have your own laptop, many cyber cafes allow wired&amp;wireless access but asking is always accepted. It is slowly becoming standard practice to allow for tourists to use their own laptops to access the Internet. It’s not recommended to travel between cyber cafes without using a trusted&amp;reliable AntiVirus application, Firewall software is not needed as cyber cafes should have their own firewall in-place. If you require a secure&amp;clean system to access private websites, many cyber cafes do cater for this if it’s not standard pratice in that cafe.

Many public libraries have public Internet access. Generally there is a charge. Hourly rates are usually in the range of $4 to $8, with a few cheaper or dearer than that. Some such as the Christchurch City Library network offer free access to some sites, usually ones of interest such as Google, BBC and CNN and those in the .nz namespace.

Wi-Fi access: You can purchase vouchers for Wi-Fi access from many Starbucks cafes around NZ and other places. Wireless Hotspots are located in many Cities and Towns all over New Zealand from dedicated Wireless providers.

Telephone

New Zealand has a well developed and ubiquitous telephone system. However public phones are relatively rare since Telecom went to the expense and trouble of removing them to prevent competitors using them, except in major transport facilities and other high pedestrian volume areas such as shopping centres. Most public phones accept obscure proprietary prepaid cards, some also accept credit cards and a very few accept Money.

Mobile telephone coverage is effectively national in near urban areas although the mountainous terrain means that outside the urban areas, and especially away from the main highway system, coverage does have dead patches. Do not rely on mobile phones in hilly or mountainous terrain. Mobile telephone users only can call *555 to report Non-emergency Traffic Safety incidents, such as a breakdown, road hazard or non-injury car crash, to the Police . There is one CDMA network run by Telecom New Zealand and one GSM network run by Vodafone, so most phones should work. Airports and shopping malls will have stores from both companies available for negotiating and getting information about their networks.

The country code is 64 . New Zealand telephone numbers can be looked up online at [51]. The emergency telephone number from all telephones is 111 (you may need to use a prefix to get an outside line from business systems, usually 1 ) and a voice request for Police, Fire or Ambulance to be switched to the requested service. (Other common international emergency numbers like 112, 911 and 999 may also work, but do not rely on it)

Postal mail

The national post office is NZ Post [52]. If you are staying in one place for a while, you can rent a PO Box from them. An alternative is the private firm like Private Box [53], which additionally can upload scanned images of selected mail so that you can read it remotely via a web browser.

Media

New Zealand has five nationwide free-to-air television channels, as well as some regional stations and several networks with sub-national coverage. Free-to-air digital television is being rolled out with a total of 18 channels to be broadcast initially. Cable television is not well developed, but direct broadcast satellite technology is available across the nation, with both free-to-air and pay television through the Sky network. Most hotels and motels have the national channels, some Sky channels and whatever else is broadcast in the local area. Most New Zealand televisions are equipped to handle Teletext which provides news, weather, sport, etc. in text format. The main page is page 100. Page 431, for example, is Auckland Airport arrivals and departures. Page 801 provides a caption text service for some TV programs which allows hearing impaired people to read subtitles.

New Zealand has a large number of radio stations, on both AM and FM, with at least one local station and a number of nationwide network stations broadcast in each major city or town.

 National Radio is a government funded, non-commercial, spoken features style national network with some music. It broadcasts news and detailed weather forecasts, generally hourly, with detailed mountain and marine forecasts a couple of times a day on both AM and FM (around 101 MHz FM). Operated by Radio New Zealand [54]. 

 There are a number of FM visitor information stations around the country.

 Vietnam 
 Posted on December 16, 2008 by admin 
 Vietnam (Việt Nam) is a country in Southeast Asia. Its neighboring countries are China to the north, Laos and Cambodia to the west.

Regions

 The North, around Hanoi ( Hà Nội ): from the Red River Delta to high mountains near China, to the World Heritage site Ha Long Bay, the North harbors some of the most magnificent views of Vietnam in an exotic context. 

 The Central Coast, around the ancient city of Hue ( Huế ), is the home of the still recent Vietnamese kings, and features one of the nicest old seacoast towns in Vietnam: Hoi An ( Hội An ), A World Heritage Site. 

 The Central Highlands, are hilly and covered with lush forest, features tribes and the occasional elephant, but is still accessible to the more adventurous. Dalat, the former retreat of the French is the largest city in the Central Highlands with a great golf course and the tallest mountain nearby. 

 The South, is the economic engine of Vietnam, built around Ho Chi Minh City ( Thành Phố Hồ Chí Minh , former Saigon) but also covering the lush and little-visited Mekong Delta, the rice basket of Vietnam. 

Cities

 Hanoi (Hà Nội)–the capital 

 Haiphong (Hải Phòng) Can Tho (Cần Thơ) Dalat (Đà Lạt)–the largest city in the highlands Da Nang (Đà Nẵng)–major port in central Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City (Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh)–Vietnam’s largest city and the economic engine of the south, formerly Saigon (Sài Gòn) Hoi An (Hội An)–delightfully well-preserved ancient port, near the ruins of Mỹ Sơn Hue (Huế)–former home of Vietnam’s emperors Nha Trang–burgeoning beach resort 

Other destinations

 Con Dao island Cu Chi, site of the Cu Chi Tunnels The DMZ Ha Long Bay (Vịnh Hạ Long)–famous for its unearthly scenery Kontum–A relaxed little town providing access to a number of minority villages. Mui Ne (Mũi Né)–beach resorts Phan Thiet–fishing town Phu Quoc (Phú Quốc)–an island adjacent to the border with Cambodia Tay Ninh (Tây Ninh)–main temple of the Cao Đài Tam Coc–Near Ninh Binh south to Hanoi with Ha Long-bay-like sceneries on rice paddies

History

Tomb of Khai Dinh, Hue

Vietnam’s history is a history of war, colonization and rebellion. Occupied by China no less than four times, the Vietnamese managed to beat off the invaders just as often. Vietnam’s last emperors were the Nguyễn Dynasty , who ruled from their capital at Hue from 1802 to 1945, although France exploited the succession crisis after the fall of Tự Đức to de facto colonize Vietnam after 1884.

After a brief Japanese occupation in World War II, the Communist Viet Minh under the leadership of Hồ Chí Minh continued the insurgency against the French, with the last Emperor Bao Dai abdicating in 1945 and a proclamation of independence following soon after. The majority of French had left by 1930, but in 1948 they returned to continue the fight until their decisive defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The Geneva Conference partitioned the country into two at 17th parallel, with a Communist-led North and Ngo Dinh Diem declaring himself President of the Republic of Vietnam in the South.

The tank that ended the war, Ho Chi Minh City

US economic and military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the Southern Vietnam government, escalating into the dispatch of 500,000 American troops in 1966 and what became known as the Vietnam War –although the Vietnamese refer to it as the American War . What was supposed to be a quick and decisive action soon degenerated into a quagmire, and US armed forces were withdrawn following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, on April 30, 1975, a North Vietnamese tank drove into the South’s Presidential Palace in Ho Chi Minh City and the war ended, with over 50,000 Americans and an estimated 3 million Vietnamese killed.

The American Vietnamese war was only one of many that the Vietnamese have fought, but it was the most brutal in its history. Over two thirds of the current population was born after 1975. American tourists will receive a particularly friendly welcome in Vietnam, as many young Vietnamese aspire to American culture.

Economy

Bustling central Hanoi

Economic reconstruction of the reunited country has proven difficult. After the failures of the state-run economy started to become apparent, the country launched a program of dổi mới (renovation), introducing elements of capitalism. The policy has proved highly successful, with Vietnam recording near-10% growth yearly (except for a brief interruption during the Asian economic crisis of 1997), but after several decades,the country is doing much better. The economy is much better than Cambodia, Laos, and other neighboring developing countries. Like most Communist countries around the world, there is a fine balance between allowing foreign investors and opening up the market; and being found to be against the political line. From the government’s perspective they need to follow the Chinese model: significant liberalization in the economy, yet not so much the case in politics.

Climate

Vietnam is large enough to have several distinct climate zones.

 The South has three somewhat distinct seasons: hot and dry from March to May/June; rainy from June/July to November; and cool and dry from December to February. April is the hottest month, with mid-day temperatures of 33°C or more most days. During the rainy season, downpours can happen every afternoon, and occasional street flooding occurs. Temperatures range from stifling hot before a rainstorm to pleasantly cool afterward. Mosquitoes are most numerous in the rainy season. December to February is the most pleasant time to visit, with cool evenings down to around 20°C. 

 The North has four distinct seasons, with a comparatively chilly winter (temperatures can dip below 15°C in Hanoi), a hot and dry summer and pleasant spring (March-April) and autumn (October-December) seasons. However, in the Highlands both extremes are amplified, with occasional snow in the winter and temperatures hitting 40°C in the summer. 

 In the Central regions the weather is somewhere in between, only just to confuse things here the rainy season is in the summer, not the winter. 

Holidays

By far the largest holiday of the year is Tết , celebration of the New Year (as marked by the lunar calendar), which takes place between late January and March on the Western calendar. In the period leading up to Tết, the country is abuzz with with preparations. Guys on motorbikes rush around delivering potted tangerine trees and flowering bushes, the traditional household decorations. People get a little bit stressed out and the elbows get sharper, especially in big cities, where the usual hectic level of traffic becomes almost homicidal. Then a few days before Tết the pace begins to slow down, as thousands of city residents depart for their ancestral home towns in the provinces. Finally on the first day of the new year an abrupt transformation occurs: the streets become quiet, almost deserted. Nearly all shops and restaurants close for three days, (the exception being a few that cater especially to foreign visitors; and hotels operate as usual.)

In the major cities, streets are decorated with lights and public festivities are organized which attract many thousands of residents. But for Vietnamese, Tết is mostly a private, family celebration. On the eve of the new year, families gather together and exchange good wishes (from more junior to more senior) and gifts of“lucky money”(from more senior to more junior). In the first three days of the year, the daytime hours are devoted to visiting—houses of relatives on the first day, closest friends and important colleagues on the second day, and everyone else on the third day. Many people also visit pagodas. The evening hours are spent drinking and gambling (men) or chatting, playing, singing karaoke, and enjoying traditional snacks and candy (women and children.)

Visiting Vietnam during Tết has good points and bad points. On the minus side: modes of transport are jammed just before the holiday as many Vietnamese travel to their home towns; hotels fill up, especially in smaller towns; and your choice of shopping and dining is severely limited in the first days of the new year (with a few places closed up to two weeks). On the plus side, you can observe the preparations and enjoy the public festivities; pagodas are especially active; no admission is charged to those museums and historical sites that stay open; and the foreigner-oriented travel industry of backpacker buses and resort hotels chugs along as usual. Visitors also stand a chance of being invited to join the festivities, especially if you have some local connections or manage to make some Vietnamese friends during your stay. When visiting during Tết, it’s wise to get settled somewhere at least two days before the new year, and don’t try to move again until a couple of days after.

Lesser holidays include May 1, the traditional socialist labor day, and September 2, Vietnam’s national day. Around those times, trains and planes tend to be sold out, and accommodations at the beach or in Dalat are hard to find. Best to book far in advance.

Get in

Most visitors to Vietnam, except citizens of Nordic (except Iceland) or ASEAN countries (except Cambodia, East Timor and Myanmar), Russia, South Korea and Japan, require a visa in advance. A single-entry tourist visa valid for 30 days costs US$65(although exact fees vary depending on issuing country) and takes around 4-7 days to process; express visas take 2-3 days at twice the price. If purchasing your visa from the Vietnamese embassy in London, a 30-day single entry visa will cost you £38, plus £8 postage if you need it posted back to you (oddly, this information is not available on the embassy’s own website). Visas are now generally valid for all entry and exit points.

Some Vietnamese Embassies offer a“While you wait service”(May 2008), where a single entry visa can be gained in 15 minutes. This service costs US$92, but is approved instantly. You are required to bring a valid passport, passport photo and cash payment (cards not accepted).

A fairly convoluted visa on arrival process has recently been introduced, but this requires a prior application to Hanoi and is generally intended mostly for groups and citizens of countries without Vietnamese embassies. The visa-on-arrival is now available at the Arrival Hall (in front of the Immigration Check-in Section) of the Tan Son Nhat International Airport.

Vietnam has moved away from the old A4 carbon copy arrival forms. Recently, they have started to use arrival/departure cards which are very similar to those found in Cambodia, Indonesia and Singapore. Keep the departure portion of this just as safe as your passport, as you will have to produce it when leaving the country to avoid a fine.

Depending on the present level of SARS, avian flu you may be subjected to a so-called health-check . There is no examination, though, but yet another form to fill in and, of course, another fee. If you can get hold of a handful of dong it is only 2000 dong per person, but they charge US$2 for the same“service”if you only have greenbacks!

By plane

Vietnam has international airports at Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Direct flights are available from Australia, Cambodia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Brunei, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan , Indonesia, Macau, Qatar and the United States. However, non-stop long-distance flights are limited and most visitors transit via Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei.

By train

Ha Long Bay on the South China Sea

There are direct international train services from Nanning and Beijing to China, although you may be required to change trains at the border at Pingxiang/Dong Dang. The Kunming-Hanoi line was shut down by landslides in 2002 and, as of 2008, remains closed.

By road

Cambodia

There are at least four border crossings between Cambodia and Vietnam that can be used by foreigners. These include:

 Bavet–Moc Bai Kaam Samnor–Vinh Xuong (in some guidebooks as Tonle Mekong. Near Chau Doc in Vietnam) Phnom Den–Tinh Bien Xa Xia, Vietnam/Prek Chak, Cambodia (Ha Tien crossing, Cambodian Visas not available) 

The Vietnamese consulate in Sihanoukville issues 30 day tourist visas on a same-day basis.

China

There are three border crossings between China and Vietnam that can be used by foreigners:

 Dongxing–Mong Cai ( by road; onward travel Mong Cai to Ha Long by sea or by road ) Hekou–Lao Cai ( by road and/or rail, but no international passenger train services ) Youyi Guan–Huu Nghi Quan (Friendship Pass– by road and/or rail ) 

Laos

There are at least six border crossings between Laos and Vietnam that can be used by foreigners. These include:

 Donsavanh–Lao Bao Kaew Neua–Cau Treo (Keo Nua Pass) Nam Can Tay Trang 

Get around

By plane

Flights are the fastest way to travel the distance of this long country; the trip from Hanoi to HCMC will take about 2 hours by plane.

By train

Although more expensive than buses, trains are undoubtedly the most comfortable way to travel overland in Vietnam. There is one major train line in Vietnam, the 1723-kilometer trunk between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, on which the Reunification Express runs. HCMC to Hanoi is more than 30 hours, and overnight hops between major destinations are usually possible, if not entirely convenient. It’s a good way to see the countryside and meet upper-middle class locals, but unless you are traveling in a sleeper car it is no more comfortable than buses.

AC Soft or hard sleeper is recommended, and purchasing as early as possible is a good idea as popular berths and routes are often bought out by tour companies and travel agents well before the departure time (hence being told the train is sold out at a station ticket window or popular tour company office does not mean there are no tickets available–they’ve simply been bought by another reseller). Booking at the train station itself is generally the safest way, just prepare on a piece of paper the destination, date, time, no. of packs and class. However, unsold tickets can often be bought last minute from people hanging around at the station–a train is rarely sold out for real, as the railway company will add cars when demand is high. Commissions on these tickets will drop away as the departure time draws nearer.

Be cautious when using a travel agent to purchase your train tickets, since there is nothing printed on the ticket saying the class you are booked in. This results in a common scam with private travel agents where you will pay them to book a soft-sleeper ticket, they then book you a cheaper hard-sleeper ticket, and you don’t know you’ve been scammed until you board the train and your berths are in the lower class. By then with the train on the verge of departing it is too late to go back to the scamming agent to demand compensation.

In addition, there are shorter routes from Hanoi leading northwest and northeast, with international crossings into China. One of the most popular of the shorter routes is the overnight train from Hanoi to Lao Cai (with bus service from Lao Cai to the tourist destination of Sapa).

Always try to buy your tickets at least 3 days in advance, to avoid disappointment, especially during peak holiday season, during which you should try to book at least a week in advance.

By bus

Long-distance bus services connect most cities in Vietnam. Most depart early in the morning to accommodate traffic and late afternoon rains, or run overnight.

 Public Buses travel between the cities’bus stations. In bigger places, you often have to use local transport to get into the city center from there. Buses are generally in reasonable shape, and you have the chance to interact with locals.

 Open Tour buses are run by a multitude of tour companies. They cater especially to tourists, offering ridiculous low rates (Hanoi to HCMC: US$20-25) and door-to-door service to your desired hostel. You can break the journey at any point and continue on a bus of the same company any time later, or simply buy tickets just for the stage you’re willing to cover next. Note that if you’re not planning to make more than 3-4 stops, it might be cheaper to buy separate tickets as you go (ie Hanoi to Hue can be had for as little as US$5). Most hotels and guesthouses can book seats for any connection, although you’re better to shop around at travel agents, as prices will vary on any given ticket/bus company. Going to the bus company office may net you a commission-free fare, but most major bus operators have fixed pricing policies, which can only be circumvented through a travel agent.

Since tour companies charge very little, they do make commission on their stop-offs which are often at souvenir shops, where you do not have to buy; they always have toilets and drinks and water available for purchase. The estimated time for a bus trip will not be accurate and may be an additional couple of hours sometimes, due to the number of stop offs. Collecting the passengers at the start of the journey can also take quite a while too. Always be at least half an hour early to catch the bus. Try not to drink too much water, as rest stops, especially for overnight buses, may be just somewhere where there are a lot of bushes.

Vietnamese buses are made for Vietnamese people–bigger Westerners will be very uncomfortable, especially on overnight buses. Also, many Vietnamese are not used to riding on long-haul buses, and will sometimes get sick–not very pleasant if you are stuck on an overnight bus with several Vietnamese throwing up behind you.

Even if you are sometimes bus-sick, it is advisable to book a sit at the middle rather than at the front of the bus. First, you will avoid viewing directly the short-sighted risks the driver is taking on the way. Second, you will somewhat escape the loud noise of unceasing honkings (each time the bus passes another vehicle, that is about every 10 seconds).

Although the bus company will usually be happy to collect you at your hotel or guest house, boarding at the company office will guarantee a choice of seats and you’ll avoid getting stuck at the back or unable to sit next to your travelling companions. The offices are generally located in or near the tourist area of town, and a short walk might make your trip that much more pleasant.

A scam that you may encounter is that after arriving at your location, the guides will ask you whether you have booked a hotel. Even though you haven’t, say that you have and prepare the name of a hotel. If you say you have not booked one, they will charter a taxi for you and probably drop you at a hotel which they can collect commission. If you decide not to stay, things may get a little ugly, as they will demand that you pay the taxi fare, which they may quote as several times the actual fare for a ten minute ride.

By car

International driving licenses are not accepted in Vietnam. The concept of renting a car to drive yourself is almost non-existent, and when Vietnamese speak of renting a car they always mean hiring a car with a driver. (After a short time on local roads with their crazy traffic, you will be glad you left the driving to a professional.) Since few Vietnamese own cars, they have frequent occasion to hire vehicles for family outings, special occasions, etc., and a thriving industry exists to serve that need. Vietnamese can easily charter anything from a small car to a 32-seat bus, for one day or several. Tourists can tap into that market indirectly by way of hotels and tour agents found in every tourist area. Additionally, international car brands have started to surface. Budget Car Rental, one of the largest car rental companies in the world, now offers chauffeur driven services in Vietnam. Hiring a small car for a day trip returning to the point of origin costs around US$60 for eight hours (though the price changes with the cost of gas). (If you shop around and bargain hard for the lowest possible price, you will probably get an older, more beat-up car. If you are paying more than bare minimum, it’s worth asking what sort of car it will be, and holding out for something comfortable.) Few drivers speak any English, so make sure you tell the hotel/agent exactly where you want to go, and have that communicated to the driver.

It’s also possible to hire a car and driver for inter-city travel, at somewhat higher cost. A small car from Saigon to the beach resort of Mui Ne, a 4- or 5-hour trip depending on traffic, costs about US$70, and Dalat to Mui Ne about US$90. Long distance travel by car may be a good choice for several people traveling together, as it provides a flexible schedule and flexible access to remote sites. Keep in mind that long-distance road travel in Vietnam by whatever means (bus or car) is slow, with average speed less than 50 km/hour. Highway 1, the north-south backbone of the country, is a two-lane road with very heavy truck and bus traffic.

By cycle

Adventurous travelers may wish to see Vietnam by motorcycle or bicycle. Several adventure travel tours provide package tours with equipment. Most of the population gets around on two wheels, so it’s an excellent way to get closer to the people, as well as off the beaten path.

In cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, parking bicycles on the sidewalks is not allowed, and you’ll have to go to a pay parking lot. 2000 dong per bike.

By motorcycle taxi

The xe ôm (literally‘hugging vehicle’) is a common mode of transport for Vietnamese as well as tourists. They are widely available and reasonably cheap—about 10,000 dong for a 10 minute trip, which should get you anywhere within the city center. Walk the city streets, and every couple of minutes a guy will flag your attention and say“You !! MotoBike?”Longer trips to outlying areas can be negotiated for 20-25,000 dong. Always agree on the fare before starting your trip. As with most things, a tourist will often be quoted an above-market price initially, and you need to be firm. If quoted anything over 10,000 dong for a short trip, remind the driver that you could take an air-con taxi for 15,000 so forget it. Occasionally drivers will demand more than the negotiated price at the end, so it’s best to have exact change handy. Then you can pay the agreed amount and walk away, end of discussion.

By motorcycle

The 110-cc motorbike is the preferred mode of transport for the Vietnamese masses, and the large cities swarm with them. It’s common to see whole families of four cruising along on a single motorbike. In most places where tourists go, you can easily rent your own, with prices ranging from 100,000 to 160,000 dong per day. Desk clerks at small hotels often run a side business renting motorbikes to guests, or have a friend or relative who does. Tour booths can usually do the same. In small towns and beach resorts where traffic is light, it’s a delightful way to get around and see the sights, and much cheaper than taxis if you make several stops or travel any distance. Roads are usually decent, though it’s advisable not to ride too fast and always keep an eye on the road for the occasional pothole.

Riding in the big cities, especially Ho Chi Minh City, is a very different matter, and not advisable unless you are an experienced rider with a very cool head. Traffic is intense and chaotic, with a long list of unwritten rules that don’t resemble traffic laws anywhere else.“Right of way”is a nearly unknown concept. Riding in HCMC is like finding yourself in the middle of a 3-D video game where anything can come at you from any direction, and you only have one life. Expats who brave the traffic at all typically have an apprenticeship of a few weeks or months riding on the back of others’motorbikes to learn the ways of the traffic, before attempting to ride themselves. Extreme caution is advised for short-term visitors.

Riding long distance in the countryside can also be harrowing depending on the route you take. Major roads between cities tend to be narrow despite being major, and full of tour buses hell-bent on speed, passing slow trucks where maybe they shouldn’t have tried, and leaving not much room at the edge for motorbikes.

Two main categories of motorbike are available to rent [2]: scooters (automatic transmission); and four-speed motorbikes, the gears of which you shift with your left foot. Rental agents tend to steer foreigners toward scooters if available, on the (plausible) assumption that they don’t know how to ride motorbikes that require shifting gears. Motorcycles of 175cc and above are only legal to ride if you make a connection with a Vietnamese motorcycle club.

Most places you would want to stop have parking attendants who will issue you a numbered tag and watch over your bike. Sometimes these parking operations are overseen by the establishment you are visiting, and sometimes they are free-lance operations set up in places where a lot of people go. You will usually see rows of bikes lined up parked. Depending on circumstance, you might park the bike yourself, or just put it in neutral and let the staff position it. In all but rare cases you keep the key. Parking is sometimes free at restaurants and cafes (look for“giu xe mien phi”). Elsewhere, fees range from 2,000 to 5,000 dong.

Traffic police in the cities pull over lots of locals (often for reasons that are hard to discern), but conventional wisdom has it that they rarely bother foreigners due to the language barrier. Obeying the traffic laws is advisable just to be sure. Licenses (to operate motorbikes) are required, although many people have been known to drive without them. Helmets are also required by law as from the December 15th, 2007, if you don’t have it already, ask your rental agent to provide them.

By cyclo

Cyclo in Hue

While slowly being supplanted by motorbikes, cyclo pedicabs still roam the streets of Vietnam’s cities and towns. They are especially common in scenic smaller, less busy cities like Hue, where it’s pleasant to cruise slowly along taking in the sights. Though the ride will be slow, hot and sometimes dangerous, you’ll generally need to pay more than for a motorbike for the equivalent distance. On the plus side, some drivers (particularly in the South) are very friendly and happy to give you a running commentary on the sights. Cyclo drivers are notoriously mercenary and will always ask for a high price to start with. Sometimes they will also demand more than the agreed price at the end. (Japanese tourists, especially women, are most often targeted with this scam since they are more responsive to the threat that the driver will call the police and make trouble for them if they don’t pay as demanded.) A reasonable price is about 20,000 dong for up to 2 km, and if the driver disagrees, simply walk away. (You won’t get far before that driver or another takes your offer.) Prices for a sight-seeing circuit with intermediate stops are more complex to negotiate and more subject to conflict at the end. If you plan to stop somewhere for any length of time, it’s best to settle up with the driver, make no promises, and start fresh later. To avoid trouble, it’s also best to have exact change for the amount you agreed to pay, so if the driver tries to revise the deal, you can just lay your cash on the seat and leave.

By boat

You will be missing a big part of Vietnamese life if you do not spend some time on a boat. Tour boats can be hired for around US$20 for a day’s tour, or you can book through a tour company. Ha Long Bay is a famous destination for one- to three-day boat trips among its scenic limestone islands. Dozens of small family-operated boats ply the river in Hue, taking visitors to the imperial tombs southwest of the city. Snorkel–fishing–lunch trips are available from Nha Trang, Hoi An, and Phu Quoc to nearby islands. A day-long boat trip forms the core of almost any tour of the Mekong region.

A 90-minute hydrofoil boat operates from Saigon to the seaside resort of Vung Tau for about 120,000 dong each way—the fastest way to reach the beach from the city.

Talk

 Vietnamese , spoken by most of the population, is a tonal language and definitely not easy for Westerners to master. It is written in the Latin (Roman) alphabet similar to most European languages (plus the use of five diacritical or accent marks), making maps and signs relatively easy to understand. More than 20% of the modern Vietnamese vocabulary originally came from Chinese (just as many English words originate from Latin or French), so travelers fluent in other East Asian languages may find some similar words.

Many young people have a basic grasp of English . It is not uncommon to meet young people who learned English in school, especially in the South. French, although not widely spoken anymore, is still used by many older Vietnamese people (those 60 and over) who were educated in French. If not English (or more accurately, in addition to English), young people may study Japanese, Korean, Thai or Chinese.

Buy

The national currency is the dong ( đồng, VND ), which has stabilized in the past few years but is difficult to find or exchange outside Vietnam. Bills are available in denominations of 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 200000 and 500000 dong. In 2003, coins were also introduced in denominations of 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 dong.

 U.S. dollars are widely accepted, the standard exchange rate for small quantities being 16000 dong to US$1; this is some 5% below the bank rate , so it’s usually better to pay in dong. Also note that dollar bills in less than perfect condition may be rejected. US$50 and US$100 notes get a higher exchange rate than notes of lower denominations. Note that all gold shops will exchange the majority of hard currencies (Sterling, Yen, Swiss Francs, Euro etc.) at reasonable rates. Be advised that travel agencies (like StaTravel in Saigon) will rip you off offering you a very low rate.

With Vietnam being a very safe country, when it comes to foreign tourists, you might opt for US$ cash as the basic staple of your money belt, but bear in mind that it is always wise not to rely on just one leg when walking.

 Traveller cheques of well known companies are widely accepted, but usually a small fee is charged. Fees might also be the only thing that would keep you from getting cash advances on visa- or mastercard at most banks. Through both ways you can also get hold of U.S. dollars, though there will be even higher fees.

 ATMs are getting more and more common and can be found in most bigger cities and every tourist destination. They will accept a selection of credit and bank-cards, including Visa, Mastercard, Maestro or Cirrus and several other systems. Not every machine will like your particular card, but“Vietcombank-ATMs”are known for the broadest variety. The amount of your withdrawal may not exceed 2,000,000 dong in one transaction. ANZ bank allows withdrawals of 4,000,000 dong per day. You will usually incur a charge of 20,000 dong for each transaction, in addition to any charges your bank will make.

There are branches of money transfer companies like Western Union, but this is always one of the more expensive ways to get money.

On most land borders connecting to Cambodia, China, and Laos there are freelance moneychangers to take care of your financial leftovers, but be assured they’ll get the better of you if you don’t know the going rate.

 Prices such as hotel and bus fares are, by government mandate, significantly higher (typically three times) for“foreign guests”than for locals.

You can bargain on practically anything in Vietnam. Most merchants will start off charging foreigner prices, which you can easily bring down by a minimum of 10%, or more if you like bargaining.

 Costs for a month’s stay can start from a backpacking US$250-500 Using basic rooms, local food and open bus transportation can keep it very close to the US$250 per month

Eat

Food sits at the very epicentre of Vietnamese culture: every significant holiday on the Vietnamese cultural calendar, all the important milestones in a Vietnamese person’s life, and indeed, most of the important day-to-day social events and interactions–food plays a central role in each. Special dishes are prepared and served with great care for every birth, marriage and death, and the anniversaries of ancestors’deaths. More business deals are struck over dinner tables than over boardroom tables, and when friends get together, they eat together. Preparing food and eating together remains the focus of family life.

At the same time, the Vietnamese are surprisingly modest about their cuisine. (And old proverb/joke says that a fortunate man has an American house, Japanese wife, and Chinese chef.) High-end restaurants tend to serve“Asian-fusion”cuisine, with elements of Thai, Japanese, and Chinese mixed in. The most authentic Vietnamese food is found at modest or even quite cheap restaurants. Definite regional styles exist—northern, central, and southern, each with unique dishes. Central style is perhaps the most celebrated, with dishes such as mi quang (wheat noodles with herbs, pork, and shrimp), banh canh cua (crab soup with thick rice noodles) and bun bo Hue (beef soup with herbs and noodles).

Many Vietnamese dishes are flavored with fish sauce ( nước mắm ), which smells and tastes like anchovies (quite salty and fishy) straight from the bottle, but blends into food very well. (Try taking home a bottle of fish sauce, and using it instead of salt in almost any savory dish—you will be pleasantly surprised with the results.) Fish sauce is also mixed with lime juice, sugar, water, and spices to form a tasty dip/condiment called nước chấm , served on the table with most meals. Vegetables, herbs and spices, notably Vietnamese coriander or cilantro ( rau mùi or rau mgò ), mint ( rau răm ) and basil ( rau húng ), accompany almost every dish and help make Vietnamese food much lighter and more aromatic than the cuisine of its neighboring countries, especially China.

Vietnam’s national dish is phở , a broth soup with beef or chicken and rice noodles ( a form of rice linguini or fettuccini). Phở is normally served with plates of fresh herbs(usually including Asian basil), cut limes, hot chilis and and scalded bean sprouts which you can add in according to your taste, along with chili paste, chili sauce, and sweet soybean sauce. Phở bò , the classic form of phở, is made with beef broth that is often simmered for many hours and may include one or more kinds of beef (skirt, flank, tripe, etc.). Phở gà is the same idea, but with chicken broth and chicken meat. Phở is the original Vietnamese fast food, which locals grab for a quick meal. Most phở places specialize in phở and can serve you a bowls as fast as you could get a Big Mac. It’s available at any time of the day, but locals eat it most often for breakfast. Famous phở restaurants can be found in both Hanoi and HCMC.

Streetside eateries in Vietnam typically advertise phở and cơm . Though cơm literally means rice, the sign means the restaurant serves a plate of rice accompanied with fish or meat and vegetables.

 Coffee , baguettes , and pastries were originally introduced by the French colonials, but all three have been localized and remain popular contemporary aspects of Vietnamese cuisine. More on cà phê below, but coffee shops that also serve light fare can be found in almost village and on multiple street corners in the bigger cities. Bánh mì Hanoi are French bread sandwiches : freshly baked white bread baguettes filled with grilled meats or liver or pork pâté, plus fresh herbs and vegetables. Most pastry shops serve a variety of sweets and quick foods, and are now owned by Vietnamese.

If you like seafood , you may find heaven in Vietnam. The ultimate seafood experience is traveling to a seaside village or beach resort area in the south to try the local seafood restaurants that often serve shrimp, crab, and locally-caught fish. Follow the locals to a good restaurant: the food will still be swimming when you order it, it will be well-prepared, very affordable by Western standards, and often served in friendly surroundings with spectacular views.

Drink

Watch out for ice in drinks. Factory-made ice is generally safe, but anything else can be suspect.

Beer

Wikitravel founder Evan quaffing bia hoi in Hoi An

Don’t miss out on bia hơi , (literally“beer gas”), or draft beer made daily. It’s available throughout Vietnam, mostly from small bars on street corners. Bia hoi bars will give you the opportunity to relax drinking in a typical Vietnamese bar surrounded by the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Every traveler can easily find these bars to experience what the locals are enjoying.

The beer is brewed daily and each bar gets a fresh batch delivered every day in plastic jugs. It’s a very light (3% alcohol) refreshing lager at a fraction of the cost of draft or bottled beer in the Western-style bars. Bia hoi is not always made in sanitary conditions and its making is not monitored by any health agency.

The most popular beer (draft, bottle or can) among the Vietnamese is Tiger . 333 , pronounced“ba-ba-ba”is a local brand, but it’s somewhat bland; for a bit more flavor, look for Bia Saigon in the green bottle and a bigger bottle than Bia Saigon Special. Bia Saigon is also available as little stronger export version. Bière Larue is also good, and you can find local brands in every larger city.

It’s regular practise for beer in Vietnam to be drunk over ice. This means that the cans or bottles need not be chilled. If you are drinking with Vietnamese people it is considered polite to top up their beer/ice before re-filling your own drink.

Wine and liquor

Vietnamese“ruou de”or rice alcohol ( ruou means alcohol) is served in tiny porcelain cups often with candied fruit or pickles. It’s commonly served to male guests and visitors. Vietnamese women don’t drink much alcohol, well at least in public. It’s not recommended for tourists.

Dating back to French colonial times, Vietnam adopted a tradition of viniculture. Dalat is the center of the winelands, and you can get extremely good red and white wine for about $2-3US.

Soft drinks

 Coconut water is a favorite in the hot southern part of the country. nước mía , or sugar cane juice , is served from distinctive metal carts with a crank-powered sugar cane stalk crushers that release the juice. Another thirst-quencher is the fabulous sinh tố , a selection of sliced fresh fruit in a big glass, combined with crushed ice, sweetened condensed milk and coconut milk. You can also have it blended in a mixer.

Sleep

Lodging is not an issue in Vietnam, even if you’re traveling on a pretty tight budget. Hotels in Vietnam range from scruffy US$4-a-night (Per couple) backpacking hostels to world-class resorts, both in the city and in popular rural destinations. Even backpacking hostels and hotels are by far cleaner and nicer than in neighbouring countries (Cambodia, Thailand, Laos), and even cheap US$4-6 per couple hotels often supply very clean rooms with towels, clean white sheets, disposable toothbrush and so on. Service in a lot of the more inexpensive hotels is actually quite good (since the fares that a person pays per night could equal a Vietnamese national’s monthly pay), although modern amenities like television and room service in some cases are hard to come by. Like many hotels, there are often drinks and snacks in the mini-refrigerators in Vietnamese hotels; but these are horribly overpriced and you would be much better off buying these items on the street. Adequate plumbing is a problem in some hotels.

It’s common practice (maybe compulsory?) that the hotel keeps guests’passport in reception during your stay.

Many hotels in the larger cities, mostly Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, have very good high-speed Internet access; but there is a fee (3000-15000 dong/hour) to use the computers in some cases.

The more high-end hotels have a multitude of free/low cost amneties; such as elaborate buffets with local cuisine, spa treatments, local sightseeing packages, etc.

Homestay accommodation is easily booked through travel agents. However, some tourists are disappointed to learn that the“homestay”they booked is really a commercial hotel.

Learn

If you want to meet local people, stop by a school. In Ho Chi Minh City (aka Saigon), visit the American Language School, where you’ll be welcomed enthusiastically and invited to go into a class and say hi. You’ll feel like a rock star.

The Vietnamese love to meet new people, and teachers welcome the opportunity for their students to meet foreigners.

Work

You can volunteer as English teacher through Travel to Teach or other volunteering organizations.

Stay safe

Crime

Vietnam is very keen on bolstering foreign tourism: with severe punishments for crimes against tourists, violent crime against foreigners is rare. Nevertheless be alert in the big cities, especially Ho Chi Minh City, where teams on motorbikes drive by their victims to snatch bags, cameras, mobile phones, jewelry, etc. Carry bags on the side away from the street, use money belts, and let the hotel reception keep your valuables.

Also infamously common are thefts on popular beaches, like in the case of Nha Trang, where tourists get into the water for a swim to find out their day bag is gone when they’re back to the beach. Never leave your bag unguarded on beaches, and keep your eyes on it.

Prostitution

Prostitution is illegal in Vietnam and the age of consent is 18. Vietnam has laws on the books with penalties up to 20 years in prison for sexually exploiting women and children, and several other countries have laws that allow them to prosecute their own citizens who travel abroad to engage in sex with children.

On the road

Be careful! When traveling within the confines of the city it is fine, as speed is pretty tame. However, getting on the freeway is dangerous, there are a lot of traffic fatalities (average is 30 deaths a day) on the freeways in Vietnam, and some locals will not even venture on them, if not in a big vehicle (car or bus).

Taking a bicycle or motobike on the freeway is not advised. There are transport buses and tour buses that go about 80 km/hour that pay very little attention to what is going on around them (as is usually the way people adhere to traffic in Vietnam). This often leads to accidents, where frequently you will see many bodies lying on the road with a blanket over them and incense burning around them.

If you are in an accident you have to get yourself to the hospital. You have to call yourself or, if lucky, get someone to call for you. Local hospitals will not accept you unless they think you can pay the bill.

Crossing the road

The stakes are high: if you are to die in Vietnam, more than likely it will happen on the road—be it in a car or under one. Vietnamese cities are crowded, and the roads are absolutely packed. You will take your life into your own hands every time that you cross a busy street in any of Vietnam’s major cities.

Although some intersections in the main cities (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City) have traffic lights and many are patrolled by a police officer, most lights are either non-functional or ignored, and you are more likely to see a traffic officer sitting in the shade than directing traffic.

In most of the Western world, the trick is to avoid the cars. That’s simply not possible in Vietnam, as there are far too many cars, trucks (lorries or utes), motorbikes, cyclos and bicycles in far too little space. No, the trick in Vietnam is to enable the vehicles to avoid you. 

This is managed by first picking a reasonable gap in the traffic (probably a smaller gap than you’d choose when jaywalking in, say London or Manhattan or Sydney), then walking slowly and predictably across the street while looking directly at the on-coming cars, motorcycles, cyclos and bicycles.

The predictability of your pace and path is the critical factor between life and death. Do not change direction or speed. 

If you stop, retreat or try to dodge the vehicles, you are risking injury, and your possible misfortune will merely annoy a lot of commuters by snarling traffic even further. But if you step confidently and carefully, the drivers will see and smoothly avoid you—often with grace and a casual aplomb that’s initially bewildering to many panic-stricken Westerners. But remember, they do this all the time, every day…or they wouldn’t be alive themselves.

The simplest way to cross a busy street is to find a local and walk close to him or her, mirroring their path and pace. They know what they’re doing! And once you get the hang of it, it’s actually great fun to find yourself walking unafraid through a deadly sea of swarming vehicles and people, suddenly feeling like part of the normal flow in this otherwise foreign land–many visitors find waiting at traffic lights quite boring upon return to their home countries.

Nightlife

Vietnam has a great night life and is reasonably safe compared to many countries. However, Vietnam is like any country, so beware of petty crimes. As in most unfamiliar places, beware of punk looking teenagers and triads. Basically don’t go looking for trouble. Remember Vietnam is a partying country and though they are lenient towards foreigners you shouldn’t try your luck. Also, things tend to get a little bit empty at night, since there is a curfew for shops to close, which is usually around 10ish. Alleyways, which there are a lot of in Vietnam, are usually safe. Use common sense.

Wildlife

Unfortunately, much of Vietnam’s dangerous wildlife is severely endangered and very rarely seen. Tigers are so rare that the odds of seeing one are extremely low, even for people living in rural parts of the country. Crocodiles are virtually extinct in Vietnam- Saltwater crocodiles were once present in the Mekong Delta (up until 20 years ago) and in much of South Vietnam, but due to war, discrimination and habitat destruction they are rare and most likely extinct as a breeding species in Vietnam. Leopards , though more common than Tigers, are still very rare. Snakes are pretty much the only common animal that represents any substantial threat to humans. The Siamese crocodile is also very rare and is the only confirmed surviving crocodile species in Vietnam, but is not a big threat to humans.

Stay healthy

Tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis are endemic in rural Vietnam. Malaria isn’t as much a concern in the bigger cities such as Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, but always remember to take mosquito liquid repellent with you. It may be very useful, especially in the countryside and crowded neighborhoods.

Although food sold on pavements looks delicious and is generally safe, it sometimes causes people to feel ill. Always check whether the environment around is clean and reliable enough.

Respect

Souvenir shops in Vietnam sell lots of T-shirts with the red flag and portraits of“Uncle Ho.”They may make good souvenirs, however as many overseas Vietnamese are highly critical of the government of Vietnam you are advised not to wear communist paraphanelia in their communities back home!

It’s common to be stared at by locals in some regions, especially in the central and northern side of the country, and in rural areas. Southerners are usually more open.

Asian women travelling with western men could attract lots of attention, being considered lovers, escorts or prostitutes by some people, but this concept is disappearing and in most cases people who still have this way of thinking belong to the low-class. However, in some cases, Asian women traveling with western men could even receive some unwanted comments. Remember that in many aspects Vietnam is still debating itself between the Middle Ages and the 21st century.

French and American travellers should tread lightly when talking about both the French Indochina War of 1946-54 and the“American War”of the mid 1960s-early 1970s. Vietnamese people consider the first as their War of Independence, while the latter conflict is viewed as a war of reunification between the north and the south. 300.000 died in the war of independence and three million Vietnamese died in the American-Vietnamese war, so do not say things that could be taken as an insult to their war dead and the enormous sacrifices made. Furthermore, do not assume that all Vietnamese think alike on this matter; many Vietnamese in the South are still bitter about having lost against the North. Differences of character among Northerners and Southerners are still very palpable, with most of them disliking each other. In general, Northerners are more closed and less friendly to foreigners, particularly Americans, and sometimes even rude.

Many travellers have noted a difference in atmosphere between Southern Vietnam and the traditionally communist North. The pressure to buy unwanted goods and pay inflated prices increases the further north you go. This has led to some travellers who have entered Vietnam from the north leaving the country without travelling to the south, which is a great pity.

Vietnam is a beautiful country but the pressure on Westerners to pay ridiculously inflated prices or invented charges can border on the aggressive–regardless of whether you’re American, British, Australian etc. Vietnamese“always”consider foreigners much richer than they are, so they will always (and sometimes without even trying to hide it) make you pay more (especially if you’re not Asian). The rule of thumb in Vietnam is to pre-negotiate the price of any service before it is rendered, especially bus, taxi, or motorcycle rides. One of the best investments you can make is in a cheap, durable, battery (solar powered are obviously useless at night) operated calculator, as this makes negotiations much easier, and avoids misunderstandings.

Taxi-motorbikes, known as“xe ôm”are available everywhere and they will constantly harass you offering you a ride (no matter if the drivers speak English or not). It’s advisable not to pick them since they will always make you pay much more than to locals and they will surely take you around for hours before getting you to the point you requested. In some cases they will take you wherever they want (tourist attractions or shops you didn’t request to go) and sometimes they will wait for you to come back (even if you don’t want them to wait) and will ask you for more money for having been waiting. Even if you speak some Vietnamese, this is not useful, since they will cheat you anyway or they will act as if they don’t understand even if they do.

Metered taxi cabs are available everywhere in Vietnam. The most reputable ones are MaiLinh taxi (green logo) which is available throughout Vietnam and Vinasun taxi which is available mostly in the South. Vinasun taxi is actually a bit cheaper than MaiLinh in Saigon. Pre-negotiating a price for a taxi ride is the best bet for anyone appearing to be a tourist — false taxi meters have been seen to jump 100,000 VND in one shot. Settling the fare beforehand can prevent such expensive scams.

Telephone

Some local numbers have a sequence of six numbers, others have seven.

 Vietnam code: +84 Ha Noi Area Code : (04) Ho Chi Minh Area Code : (08) 

 VoIP calls 

Telephone bills are 30% to 40% cheaper if dialed with 171 or 178 services.

 Domestic call : 171 (178) + 0 + Area code + Number. International call : 171 (178) + 00 + Country code + Area code + Number. 

Since hotels and guesthouses often charge higher for telephone calls, try to find a post office or any reliable public service.

Mobile phones

There are many mobile networks with different codes:

 Vinaphone: 91, 94, 121 (GSM) Mobilefone: 90, 93, 122 (GSM) Viettel: 98,97, 168, 169 (GSM) Sphone: 95 (CDMA) HT Mobile: 92 (CDMA) EVN Telecom: 96 (CDMA) 

You can buy a SIM CARD in every shop selling mobile phones, or showing their network’s brands. The standard price is no higher than 75,000 VNĐ, but foreigners are often charged 100,000 VNĐ.

Prepaid account charges vary from 1,700 VNĐ to 2,500 VNĐ per minute. Recharge cards are available in denominations of 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 and 500,000 VNĐ.

Internet

Internet access is available in all but the most remote towns. Rates are fairly cheap, but range wildly depending on the area and clientele (2000-10,000 dong). Connection speeds are high, especially in the big cities, but any tasks more complex than email and basic surfing may prove tedious, or even impossible. Most of these internet shops have ADSL, especially ones charging higher rates. Many hotels provide free access (terminals as well as wireless) for their guests, although free internet is always a mixed bag.

History

The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the mid-3rd century B.C. and a great civilization developed at such cities as Anuradhapura (kingdom from c. 200 B.C. to c. 1000 A.D.) and Polonnaruwa (c. 1070 to 1200).

Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century, the island was ceded to the British in 1796 and became a crown colony in 1802. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; the name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972.

Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted in violence in the mid-1980s. Tens of thousands have died in that violence. Since late 2001 there has been a ceasefire and slow-going peace talks (as of January 2008 the ceasefire is formally ended [3]), and even war-torn parts of the island are now open for travel.

Since the outbreak of hostilities between the government and armed Tamil separatists in the mid-1980s, several hundred thousand Tamil and Sinhala civilians have fled the island; as of mid-1999, approximately 66,000 were housed in 133 refugee camps in south India, another 40,000 lived outside the Indian camps, and more than 200,000 Tamils have sought refuge in the West (July 2002 est.)

Get in

By plane

 Sri Lankan Airlines [4] is a national flagship carrier operating to and from Colombo-Bandaranayake. Flights are available from origins throughout Europe, Southeast Asia, China, Japan, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. SL also flies to the nearby resort areas of Goa, India and the Maldives.

Sri Lankan also code shares with Emirates Airlines of the United Arab Emirates. This allows for connections from places SL doesn’t fly to itself such as North America.

 Mihin Lanka [5], Sri Lanka’s first (and only) low-cost airline started operating in 2007. They fly to various points in India as well as Bangkok, Dubai, Male and Singapore.

 Other airlines include Singapore, Malaysia, Thai, Cathay Pacific, Qatar, Saudi Arabian, LTU (Germany), and Edelweiss Air (Switzerland).

From USA/Canada

There are no direct flights outside of Asia (incl. Middle East) and Europe. From the west coast of the USA/Canada, the distance is almost half-way around the world. Depending on your preferences, and how much spare time you have, consider a stopover in Europe or SE Asia. Another option (for both coasts) is the non-stop flights over the north pole to New Delhi or Mumbai, India from Atlanta, Chicago, Newark, New York (city), or San Francisco. In many cases, this may be the fastest route, but check if an Indian transit visa is required.

By ship

You can take Indian Shipping lines cargo and passenger ship from Trivandrum cheaper than the planes. Sri Lanka port authority [6] has information.

Get around

Three-wheeler

The most common mode of transport in Sri Lanka is via a three-wheeled automobile appropriately referred to as a three-wheeler ( Tri-Shaw ). Also known as Tuk-Tuks from the noise of their motors. These operate in a manner similar to taxis, and is a highly cost-efficient way to get around. However, three-wheelers have been linked to many illegal and criminal activities, including an assasination attempt on a foreign ambassador, in the recent past.

By car

 Rented cars usually turn out cheaper than three-wheelers, and are less prone to road accidents–and are recommended by most hotels.

Rented cars often come with their own drivers. Often the automobile itself is free, whereas the driver will charge a fee for his services. Some drivers/guides are government-licensed; some are extremely knowledgeable and multi-lingual, specializing in historical and cultural knowledge, and environment/natural history for your visits to the ancient sites and the natural reserves.

Tour operators

Tour Operators are happy to get you a van and a driver who will take you all over the island but beware, the roads are bumpy and slow. Ask to be shown on a map where you are going before agreeing to any‘tour’of the island. Senseless backtracking to lengthen the trip and increase the cost is a real danger. Again, insist on seeing a day-to-day planned tour map before agreeing to a tour operator’s idea of seeing Sri Lanka.

Taxi companies

Taxis (011 2556556, 011 2377677, 011 2818818, 0112588588, 0112 688688) are a better way of getting around Colombo than three wheelers as, due to the metering, they often turn out to be cheaper. Rates are about USD0.55 and they have full day packages (approx 8 hours and 80km) for around USD 40.

They will also take you outstation for around USD 0.30-0.35 per km with no waiting charges. You can also set up your own itenary and travel around that way as opposed to whatever the tour operator tells you.

By bus

(see warning at top of page) For those on a budget buses are everywhere. They’re ridiculously crowded and massively uncomfortable, but they get you around for almost nothing; it costs about a dollar to get half-way across the island. If you’re planning on splashing out, AC buses run most routes for twice the price, which offer air-conditioning and a guaranteed seat. However, they’re still uncomfortable. Bus stations are confusing places, especially the big ones, but almost everyone will be delighted to practice their English and help you.

By train

(see warning at top of page) Trains also run in some places–these can be slower than buses, depending if you are on a line that offers an express train or not, but more comfortable and picturesque and even less expensive than buses. The Railway system in Sri Lanka is very picturesque when entering the hill country because of the winding tracks along the mountains especially on the Badullu-Nanu Oya line. Make sure, if you can, to sit on the right side of the train, as it offers the better view. Sri Lanka has an extensive railway system serving all major towns and cities in the island except for the North and the East. There are special Observation cars for tourists that like to take in the scenery.

By plane

Sri Lankan Airlines operates small Seaplane service to destinations such as Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Galle and many more locations. This is perfect for Photography trips because you can get a bird’s eye view of the island and takes less time to get to a destination than using the road. Also the seaplanes land on picturesque lakes and tanks around the island.

Talk

The majority of Sri Lankans speak Sinhala , with Tamil as the second language. English is commonly used by government and tourism officials. Don’t expect everyone, everywhere to be able to speak it fluently. It’s much more common in the beach and tourist areas. Most people in rural villages cannot speak any English, beyond a few simple words.

 Sinhala Language The greeting in Sinhala is“aa-yu-BO-wan”It means that“May you live longer”;‘Thank you’is“sthu-thee.”. Tamil Language : The greeting in Tamil is“Vanakkam”;‘Thank you’is“Nanri” Sri Lankan Moor : If you meet a Muslim it is polite to say“Assalamu Aliakum”(Arabic); and Thank You“Jaza-ka Alla”(arabic) 

Sinhala writing is much more curved than Tamil. After a while, you’ll learn how to distinguish between the two.

Buy

The currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee. The exchange rates are approximately 110Rs/ USD, or 170Rs/ EUR. There are coins for 25 and 50 cents (bronze), 1 rupee (old version is big and silver, new version is small and gold,) 2 rupees (silver,) and 5 rupees (gold,) as well as banknotes ranging from 10- 2000 rupees. Coins that are more than a few years old are typically in quite bad condition.

Handicrafts Of Sri Lanka. For reed, cane, cotton, paper, leather, wood, clay, metal, and gemstones have been transformed and re-expressed in a array of batiks, toys, curios and jewelery, all exquisite hand made treasures.

Credit cards and ATMs

ATMs are located in many places (specially at bank branches) in the cities and suburbs, less so in the countryside.

You can withdraw from debit cards too (Cirrus, Maestro, Visa Electron etc) where the logos are displayed–so no need to carry wads of US dollars when entering the country.

Eat

Sri Lanka and South Indian food share a lot in common, and many local restaurants will describe their menus as Sri Lankan&amp;South Indian . There are a number of regional variations thought, the different types of hopper, devilled prawns/cuttlefish/chicken/etc. and the common fiery addition to any curry, pol sambol made of grated coconut, red chilli powder and lime juice.

The food is very cheap generally, with a cheap meal costing about a dollar. The most expensive, tourist-orientated places seldom charge more than ten dollars. The staple food of Sri Lankans is rice and curry –a massive mound of rice surrounded by various curries and delicacies. If you want to eat a cheap lunch you can follow the Sri Lankan crowds and duck into any of a million small cafes, confusingly called‘Hotels’. These normally sell a rice and curry packet, as well as‘short eats’, a collection of spicy rolls. This is ideal for backpackers and those who want to get past the touristy hotels selling burnt chicken and chips–you’re charged by how much you eat, and unless you’re absolutely ravenous it probably won’t cost over a dollar.

 Kottu (Kothu) Roti (a medley of chopped roti, vegetables and your choice of meat) is a must-have for anyone–tourist or otherwise–in Sri Lanka. It is uniquely Sri Lankan and tastes best when made fresh by street vendors.

Note that Sri Lankans eat with their right hands –this isn’t a major problem, because everywhere will be able to provide cutlery if you can’t eat otherwise. But try the Sri Lankan way (tips of fingers only!), it’s harder than it looks but strangely liberating.

There are many upscale restaurants to choose from in the city of Colombo. There are many fine dining restaurants at the 5 star hotels which offer both Local and International cuisine.

Drink

 Water is not always healthy for unseasoned travelers, and so it is recommended that either purifying tablets or bottled water be used whenever possible. Fresh milk , due to the climate, spoils easily, and so is often very expensive. Powdered milk, however, is safe and is often substituted.

 Thambli the juice from yellow coconuts, is very refreshing. It’s sold at the side of streets throughout the island, you know it’s clean as the coconut is cut open in front of you and it’s cheaper than bottled drinks at about R20/- each.

 Soft drinks are available almost everywhere, normally in dusty-looking glass bottles. The local producer, Elephant, make a range of interesting drinks–try the ginger beer and cream soda.

“Coca Cola”and“Pepsi”also available in large and small sizes (plastic bottles) including several local soft drink brands–all available at rapidly multiplying supermarkets all across the country and grocery shops.

The most common local beer is Lion Lager . For something a bit different try Lion Stout . It is characterized by it’s tar-like oiliness of body and chocolate finish. Other brews include Three Coins , which is brewed by the Mt Lavinia hotel chain, allegedly to a Belgian recipe.

The traditional spirit is Arrack , which costs about 4 USD for a bottle, and is often drunk with ginger beer. The quality can vary depending on how much you want to pay. However, widely recommended brand would be“Old Reserve”and worth paying 7.5 USD for it.

Sleep

Accommodation is very cheap. Guesthouses normally don’t offer a single rate, but you can always try bargaining.

Stay safe

 WARNING : Tensions are rising in Sri Lanka between the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. Check news reports and travel advisories before departing. The area around Koddiyar Bay and the Trincomalee District in the northeast is especially dangerous, with the southern part of the bay effectively a war zone. Travel insurance is strongly recommended. However, the information below is still accurate. 

The Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels do not target tourists, although in very rare instances, a few tourists have been wounded (mostly minor) by terrorist actions, while a somewhat larger number have witnessed and been frightened by them. Historically, the Tamils have had a close relationship with the British, and are not anti-Western. It’s believed that the Tigers would prefer to have no Western or foreign casualties, and they have planned their operations accordingly. In general, traffic accidents should be a greater concern than terrorism. There is heavy security in all sensitive locations, and together with the country’s long experience in dealing with it would probably make any radical or foreign terrorism less likely than elsewhere. In addition, Sri Lanka has good relations with all nearby countries (who aren’t always at peace with each other) and internationally as well. One block on the inland side of Galle Road in Kollupitiya (across from the US embassy&amp;British High Commission) is closed to pedestrians in front of the Prime Minister’s residence (called The Temple Trees ). This may not be well marked on the southern side.

It’s advised that tourists not travel to areas under control of the Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels. Some areas may contain land mines, and the facilities in cities and towns are war torn. Military action by the government is also possible. It is highly unlikely, though, that someone could inadvertently go into a war zone due to the large number of government checkpoints. Such areas are far distant from places tourists normally visit. Note though, it is common to see well-armed soliders on the streets, main highways and airport.

Violent crime is not a serious problem for tourists in Sri Lanka. As in most tourist locations, beware of pickpockets, and don’t leave valuables unguarded. Women should not be alone at night on the beach or streets. There has been a slight increase in violent crimes involving tourists in the past few years, but it is still rare.

Con artist and touts are a serious problem throughout all tourist areas. Using the services of a tout for accommodation, local travel, etc. will most likely increase the price. Do not believe anyone who claims to be a professional (e.g. airline pilot), or in charge of a location (like a bus terminal) without proof. Scams involving gemstones are common. Do not buy with the intention of selling them in your home country for a profit. Also, beware of single males who wish you to accompany them after a religious service. First, ask other members if the person is honest and reliable. Dishonest Sri Lankans (mostly male) are very adept at talking tourists out of their money, and generally prefer this method over violence.

Although snake bites are extremely rare among tourists (comparable to being struck by lightning), anyone bitten should seek prompt medical care. This is true even if the bite doesn’t result in any pain and swelling.

Stay healthy

 Vaccination are recommended for Hepatitis A+B, Polio, and Tetanus. Also, the Typhus vaccination outside of tourist areas especially in the wet season. 

 Dengue fever : During the rainy season use mosquito repellent. When head and joint aches occur get a blood check. There is no vaccination yet. 

 Malaria : Gampaha (e.g. Negombo), Colombo, Kalutara, Galle, and Nuwara Eliya districts are considered malaria free , as is the city (but not the entire district) of Kandy. Elsewhere, malaria exists and is most likely in Anuradhapura. In the dry season, using DEET repellent for a mid-day road or train trip to Kandy (including visits to the Peradeniya Gardens) or Nuwara Eliya should suffice. Risk increases after sunset. Malaria prophylaxis (anti-malarials) are warranted for trips to the north (especially Anuradhapura), east, and southeast (however some types are not available locally, and it may not be as effective as what you could obtain back home.) 

 Yellow fever : A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required from travelers over 1 year of age coming from infected areas. 

Respect

There are several customs that (for Westerners) take a bit of getting used to.

 It is customary to remove shoes and wear respectful attire (i.e. no miniskirts, tank tops, short pants etc.) when visiting temples. It is also the custom to remove shoes before entering a home, though this is not as strictly followed as in places such as Japan. Never touch or pat the top of the head of Buddhists, including children. Exceptions are made for cutting hair, etc., but it should never be a surprise without permission. Assume all strangers could be Buddhists for this purpose (except in exclusively Tamil areas, or non-Buddhist places of worship). Do not turn your back to (or be alongside) a Buddha statue when within a reasonable distance (observe what others are doing). This includes posing for photos. It’s OK to photograph a statue, but all persons should be facing it. Public nudity (including females being topless) is not only unacceptable but illegal in Sri Lanka–though a few German-owned hotels may make an exception in designated areas. Although much latitude is given to tourists, it is more polite to use your right hand when shaking hands, handing money and small objects, etc. Of course you can use both hands for something big and/or heavy. Be respectful to monks . There’s no particular etiquette for Westerners–just be polite. Always give them a seat on a crowded bus (unless you’re disabled or very elderly). No photography of sensitive locations (inside and outside), and inside of shopping malls and tea factories (outside OK). Be especially careful in Fort, Colombo (except on the beach). If soldiers are guarding something, it probably shouldn’t be photographed. Don’t rely on signs alone, as sometimes they are old or missing. For example, one end of a bridge may have a“No Photography”sign, but not the other.

 Philippines 
 Posted on December 16, 2008 by admin 
The Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas ) is an archipelago in South-East Asia consisting of 7,107 islands located between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea, east of Vietnam, and north of Sabah and Borneo.

The Philippines is an archipelago abundant in nature, rich in culture, and filled with pleasant discoveries. Experience the Philippines, its 7,107 islands, its natural wonders, colorful history and warm, engaging people. Over a hundred ethnic groups, a mixture of foreign influences and a fusion of culture and arts have enhanced the uniqueness of the Filipino race and the wonder that is the Philippines.

Cities

 Manila–the national capital. The Metropolitan Manila area includes several cities and municipalities to form one administrative body governed jointly by the local governments and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). 

 Angeles–interesting place with a colorful history; the lady bar capital of the Phillipines. Bacolod–the city of smiles and land of sweet tooths. 

 Baguio–the country’s summer capital (cool weather), nice parks and views, home of the“Igorot”peoples, vegetable gardens 

 Cagayan de Oro–known as the City of Golden Friendship, it is popular for whitewater rafting. As the gateway to Northern Mindanao, it is the jump off point to destinations like Camiguin Island and Bukidnon Province. 

 Cebu–also known as the Queen City of the South, Cebu is the first established indigenous settlement discovered by the west in the Philippines. For a short time before the re-dedication of Manila, Cebu City served as the capital of the far eastern territory claimed by Spain. 

 Davao–one of the largest cities in the world in terms of land area. Relatively young when compared with Manila or Cebu, it has grown to become the economic and commercial hub of the southern island of Mindanao. Nearby you’ll find the country’s tallest mountain (Mount Apo), the endangered Philippine Eagle, and one of the priciest orchids in the world, the Waling-waling (Vanda Sanderiana.) 

 Tagbilaran City, Bohol–the City of Friendship, site of the Blood Compact Treaty between Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and Rajah Sikatuna representing the Bol-anon people (of Bohol). The main entry point to Bohol’s Chocolate Hills, centuries-old churches and Panglao Island’s white-sand beaches and world-class dive sites. 

 Vigan–historic Spanish town and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

 Zamboanga City aslo known as the Asia’s Latin City, Zamboanga City brings its best foot forward during the popular Fiesta Pilar, celebrated in honor of the city’s patron saint, La Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza, Spain. The people of Zamboanga speak a unique Creole language called Chavacano–a blend of Spanish and European, Mexican-Indian words with a spattering of several local dialects,and Zamboanga is an important part of BIMP-EAGA area which stands for Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. BIMP-EAGA is an agreement among the four Southeast Asian neighbor countries for economic cooperation. It has put Zamboanga City in touch with towns in Malaysia and Indonesia. As a result of contacts arising from BIMP-EAGA, an air and sea route has been opened between Zamboanga City and Sandakan in Malaysia.

History

The Chocolate Hills of Bohol

Hawksbill Turtle in Sabang

Several thousand years ago, the first settlers in the Philippines crossed shallow seas and land bridges from the Asian mainland to arrive in this group of islands. These were the Negritos or Aetas. Direct descendants of these people can still be found in Zambales province to the North of Manila. Several thousand years later, they were then followed by Austronesian settlers travelling the same route as the Negritos but this time over sea in their impressive Barangay boats (the word is still used to refer to the smallest political subdivision in the Philippines, the Barangay). After settling the islands, they traveled further and settled the islands of Indonesia, Malaysia as well as the whole Pacific. The early Austronesians of the Philippines simultaneously traded with each other as well as with the Chinese, Japanese, Okinawans, Indians, Thais, Arabs and other Austronesians of present-day Malaysia and Indonesia. An interesting mix of cultures developed in the islands, and a writing system as well as a social structure developed quickly. Hinduism and Buddhism was introduced by traders from India, Sumatra and Java. These two religions syncretized with the various indigenous animistic beliefs. Later, Arab, Malay and Javanese traders converted the natives, mainly in the island of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago to Islam. When the explorer Ferdinand Magellan set foot on Philippine soil in 1521, the Philippines was predominantly Hindu and Buddhist with some Muslim inhabitants mainly in the southern part of the country. Magellan was Portuguese but it was a Spanish Expedition which he led to the islands which were eventually claimed by Spain as its colony. The Philippines was named for Crown Prince Philip II of Spain and most of the natives converted to Catholicism. The Muslims in the south and various animistic mountain tribes, however, resisted Spanish conquest and Catholic conversion.

The Philippines remained a Spanish colony for over 300 years until 1899 when it was ceded by Spain to the United States following the Spanish-American War. American presence remained until World War II when Japan invaded the Philippines. The Japanese occupation lasted from 1941 to 1945 when Gen. Douglas McArthur fulfilled his promise and liberated the country from the Japanese.

In 1946, the Philippines was granted full independence by the U.S., although they maintained a military presence in the country through the Subic Naval Base in Zambales and Clark Air Base in Angeles City. These facilities were ultimately returned to the Philippines in the early 1990′s.

Up until the 1960′s, the Philippines was second only to Japan in terms of development within the region. Several decades of corrupt rule by Ferdinand Marcos, however, plunged the country into debt and the Philippines ultimately became known as the sick man of Asia. Poverty was widespread and infrastructure for development was severely lacking. In 1986, the People Power uprising finally overthrew the Marcos government and he was replaced by Cory Aquino, widow of slain opposition leader, Benigno“Ninoy”Aquino, Jr.

A couple of decades more have passed and somehow the Philippines is still lagging in comparison to its South East Asian neighbors Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Development is still slow but the country is at least moving in the right direction in recent times.

People

Luneta Park

The people of the Philippines, or Filipinos, are descended from Austronesians (related to Malays and Polynesians) and of other races. Many, particularly in the cities of Luzon and the Visayas, have Chinese, Spanish, and American admixtures, whereas those living in the provinces are mostly of pure Filipino origin. Many Muslims in Mindanao have Arab, Indian and Chinese admixtures. The four largest foreign minorities in the country are as follows: Chinese (1st), Koreans (2nd), and Indian (3rd), and the Japanese (4th). Also of significance are the Americans, Indonesians, and Arabs. Pure Spaniards, and other Europeans, form a small proportion in the country’s population.

Filipinos are hospitable by nature. Guests will often be treated like royalty in Philippine households. This is most evident during fiestas when even virtual strangers are welcomed and allowed to partake of the feast that most, if not all, households within the town serve during the occasion. At times, this hospitality is taken to a fault. Some households spend their entire savings on their fiesta offerings and sometimes even run into debt just to have lavish food on their table. They spend the next year paying for these debts and preparing for the next fiesta.

Also, it may seem peculiar for tourists to notice the Latin flair in Filipino culture. Philippine culture compared to the rest of Asia is highly Hispanized. Still, Filipinos are essentially South-east Asian and many indigenous and pre-Hispanic attitudes are still obvious.

Faith

San Agustin Church, Intramuros, Manila

The Philippines is not only the largest Christian country in Asia, it is the world’s third largest Catholic Nation. The Catholic faith remains the single biggest legacy of three hundred years of Spanish colonial rule. Catholicism is still taken quite seriously in the Philippines. Masses still draw crowds from the biggest cathedrals in the metropolis to the smallest parish chapels in the countryside. During Holy Week, most broadcast TV stations close down or operate only on limited hours and those that do operate broadcast religious programs. The Catholic Church also still exerts quite a bit of influence even on non-religious affairs such as affairs of state. Mores are changing slowly, however; Filipinos are now slowly accepting what were previously taboo issues in as far as Catholic doctrine is concerned, such as artificial birth control and the dissolution of marriage vows.

The biggest religious minority are Muslim Filipinos who primarily live in Mindanao and Sulu, and account for around 5% of the population. Terrorist attacks and violent confrontations between the Filipino army and militant Islamic organizations such as the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front has strained the relations between the Muslim and the non-Muslim population. The Muslims are sometimes being seen at times as“dangerous”. The Muslim Filipinos differ in their interpretations of Islam, and like the Muslims of Indonesia, are generally more relaxed regarding such topics as gender-segregation or the hijab (veil). Indian Filipinos, Chinese Filipinos, and Japanese Filipinos are mostly Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Shinto, and Taoist which all accounts 3% of the population of the Philippines.

Climate

The climate is tropical, with March to May (summer) being the hottest months. The rainy season starts in June and extends through October with strong typhoons possible. The coolest months are from November to February, with mid-January to end of February considered the best for cooler and dryer weather. Locations exposed directly to the Pacific Ocean have frequent rainfall all year. This includes the popular Pagsanjan Falls southeast of Manila (though the falls will get you wet regardless). The average temperatures range from 78°F / 25°C to 90°F / 32°C, and humidity is around 77 percent. Baguio, which is branded as the summer capital of the Philippines, tends to be cooler due to its being located in mountainous regions with temperatures at night going below 20°C (68°F).

Holidays

Being a predominantly Catholic country means observing the traditional Catholic holidays of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday during Lent. Christmas and New Year’s Day are also observed as non-working holidays along with All Saints Day on November 1. In recognition of the Muslim Filipino, the Islamic feast of Eid-Al-Fitr (known in the Philippines as Hari Raya Puasa ), held after Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, is also a national holiday. This day changes year by year, as it follows the Lunar Calendar. Secular holidays include Labor Day (May 1) and Independence Day (June 12). Some holidays also commemorate national heroes such as Jose Rizal (Dec. 30) and Andres Bonifacio (Nov. 30). Metro Manila is less congested during Holy Week as people tend to go to their hometowns to spend the holidays there. Despite this, it is not a good idea to be in the metropolis at this time as most malls, shops and attractions are closed. Apart from Lent, malls and shops particularly in tourist areas generally still remain open on holidays. Shops may observe limited hours on Christmas, New Year and All Saints’Day. Holy week is also considered part of the super peak season for most beach resorts such as Boracay and the most popular ones tend to get overcrowded at this time. Due to its cool mountain weather, Baguio is also where a lot of people spend the Holy Week break.

Get in

The Mayon volcano, near Bicol

On entering the Philippines foreigners from most countries [2] automatically get a free 3-week tourist visa. If intending on staying longer you should apply for a visa extension. Each visa extension is valid for 59 days, except the first which is 38 days (i.e 59-21).

You can pay on departure a fine of PhP1000 per month of overstay plus the PhP2020 fee.

To avoid all the hassle, before traveling get the longer visa from the embassy (or a consulate), as this saves you a couple of days hassle during your holiday. Contact the Philippine embassy of your country about the exact requirements for a visa application and opening hours of the consular section. When you arrive with a visa, show it to the immigration official, so that he will actually give you the 59 days, instead of the normal 21 days, on your arrival stamp.

Since the Philippines is an archipelago, most visitors will arrive by plane. International travelers can fly into airports in Manila, Cebu, Davao, Clark (Angeles), Kalibo, Laoag, Subic (Zambales), and Zamboanga.

NAIA Centennial Terminal (Terminal 2)

If you plan to travel around the various islands, it is best to get an open jaw ticket. This can save much time back tracking. Most common open jaw combination in flying into Manila and out of Cebu.

The cheapest options when coming from Europe or South America is transitting via Singapore or Hong Kong and from North America, using Philippine Airlines which has direct service from Vancouver and a stopover in Guam from San Francisco and Los Angeles. There are many regional carriers that can give excellent open jaw ticket options Silkair with Singapore Airlines being one.

Most visitors will fly in through the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila. NAIA has three terminals. Terminal 2 is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines for its International and Domestic flight networks and by Air Philippines for its Domestic flight networks. Terminal 1 is used by airlines that fly to international destinations. The Manila Domestic Passenger Terminal is used by airlines that fly to domestic destinations. Terminal 3, the largest and most modern of the terminals , is open to some domestic operations.

Major airlines that fly to Manila include KLM, which have daily connections from Amsterdam coming from Europe; Northwest Airlines, which has various connections from the United States via Japan; Singapore Airlines with multiple connections each day to Singapore, and Cathay Pacific which offers multiple flights a day to Hong Kong and further into the the Chinese Mainland. Budget carrier Jet Air Asia operates flights from Singapore to Manila unlike other low cost carriers which fly to Clark (see below).

Major airlines that fly into Manila include (as of April 2008):

 Air Macau (Macau) Air Niugini (Hong Kong, Port Moresby) Asiana Airlines (Busan, Seoul-Incheon) Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong) Cebu Pacific (Bangkok, Guangzhou, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Macau, Seoul-Incheon, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Xiamen) China Airlines (Kaohsiung, Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan) China Southern Airlines (Beijing, Guangzhou, Xiamen) Continental Airlines (as Continental Micronesia; Guam, Koror, Saipan, Yap) Emirates (Dubai) Etihad Airways (Abu Dhabi) EVA Air (Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan) Gulf Air (Manama, Muscat) Hawaiian Airlines (Honolulu) Hong Kong Express Airways (Hong Kong) Japan Airlines (operated by JALways; Tokyo-Narita) Jetstar Asia Airways (Singapore) KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (Amsterdam) Korean Air (Seoul-Incheon, Busan) Kuwait Airways (Bangkok, Kuwait) Malaysia Airlines (Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur) Northwest Airlines (Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Nagoya-Centrair, Tokyo-Narita) Philippine Airlines (Bangkok, Beijing, Busan, Chengdu, Chongging, Fukuoka, Guam, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Jakarta, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nagoya-Centrair, Okinawa, Osaka-Kansai, San Francisco, Seoul-Incheon, Shanghai-Pudong, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan, Tokyo-Narita, Vancouver, Xiamen) Qantas (Brisbane, Sydney) Qatar Airways (Doha) Royal Brunei (Bandar Seri Begawan) Saudi Arabian Airlines (Dammam, Jeddah, Riyadh) Singapore Airlines (Singapore, Jakarta) Thai Airways International (Bangkok, Osaka-Kansai) 

From either international airport, passengers can connect to domestic flights. Philippine Airlines domestic flights leave from the same airport (Terminal 2), while other domestic airlines fly out of the old domestic airport.

The Diosdado Macapagal International Airport in Clark, Angeles City is where budget airlines like Air Asia (from Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu) and Tiger Airways (from Singapore and Macau) fly to, aside from that it also receives direct flights from Hong Kong and Korea. Clark is located to the north of Metro Manila, about 1 to 2 hours by bus. Currently Cebu Pacific operates domestic flights to Cebu-Mactan airport, and South East Asian Airlines operates flights to Boracay’s Caticlan airport. Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific are currently awaiting approval to open up new hubs/focus cities at Diosdado Macapagal International Airport. It is set to replace the Ninoy Aquino International Airport as the country’s premier gateway in 10 years time.

The Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu on the island of Mactan, is the second busiest airport with various domestic and international connections.

Major airlines that have regular flights in and out of Cebu include (as of August 2007):

Get around

By plane

 Philippine Airlines [4] and Air Philippines [5], Cebu Pacific [6], SEAIR [7], Asian Spirit [8] and Interisland Airlines [9] are some of the airlines that operate domestic flights. Philippine Airlines, Air Philippines and Cebu Pacific serve most large cities, while smaller operators like SEAIR, Asian Spirit and Interisland Airlines typically fly to popular resort destinations.

By train

Within Metro Manila, there is a network of light railway systems that connect various portions of the metropolis. The Philippine National Railways network in the south is dilapidated and possibly not advisable for tourists to take.

By car

The Strong Republic Nautical Highway has made travel by car across the various islands possible, albeit quite impractical for tourists due to long travel times required and the relatively cheap air fares between the major cities. If one is insistent on driving, the major car rental companies such as Avis, Hertz and Budget have offices in Metro Manila, notably at the airport. These companies have chauffeur driven rentals available and prices are bound to be reasonable.

Due to heavy traffic in Metro Manila, certain areas of the city have laws that restrict certain vehicles based on the day of the week and the ending number of your vehicle’s license plate (this plan is called“Color Coding”, though it has nothing to do with the color of your vehicle). For example: Cars with license plates ending in 1 or 2 cannot drive between the hours of 7am and 7pm on Mondays on most main roads. Be sure to check with a local contact or the car rental agency/hotel concierge about whether these rules will apply to your vehicle, especially as foreigners driving can become targets for less scrupulous traffic aides.

Travel from Metro Manila to various provinces in Luzon will typically start off from either the North or South Expressways. These are tollways with good asphalt paved roads. Farthest tolls will not cost more than a few dollars from Metro Manila. From the expressways, national highways and provincial roads connect to the major cities and provinces.

Bridges and ferries connect the major islands together. Roads vary greatly in quality from the paved multi-lane highways to narrow dirt roads, which further complicates travel by car

By taxi

Taxis are generally available within the major cities but are usually not used for travel across the various provinces and regions. Some FX (shared taxis), however, usually ply provincial routes.

You can also call reputable Taxi companies that can arrange pickups and transfers as well as airport runs.

Basic Taxi Company Tel: 02 9001447 Tel: 02 6427777 Tel: 02 6437777

When hailing a taxi in the cities, ensure the meter is on and pay the metered fare. A tip of 20 pesos is acceptable. Also, make sure you have small denomination banknotes, as the drivers often claim not to have change in an effort to obtain a larger tip!

By bus

Apart from flying, buses are usually the way to go when it comes to traveling across the Philippines, at least from within the major islands. Provincial bus companies have scheduled trips from Manila to provinces to the north and south.

 Major Provincial Bus Companies:
 ALPS The Bus, Inc. [10]—Southern Tagalog Region. The bus company have daily departures from Batangas to Alabang; Batangas to Lawton; Batangas to Pasay; Batangas to Cubao/Kamias; Cubao to Iloilo; Cubao to Estancia and vise versa. You can travel safely and conveniently with the everyday low fares on ALPS. They can be contacted via web: www.alpsthebus.com; e-mail: info@alpsthebus.com; Telephone: +6343-7239033 JAM Bus Co—Southern Tagalog Region Five Star—Ilocos Region Victory Liner—Ilocos Region, Baguio and Zambales Saulog Transit—Baguio, Olongapo, Cavite Partas—Ilocos Region Farinas—Ilocos Region Dagupan Bus Co.—Ilocos Region Philtranco—Bicol, Eastern Visayas, Northern, Eastern, and Southern Mindanao Rural Transit—Zamboanga Peninsula Rural Tour—Zamboanga Peninsula 
 

Roll-on, Roll-off ferries have also made inter-island travel by bus possible.

By boat

WG&amp;A SuperFerry and a number of other companies operate interisland ferries. There is a convenient Friday overnight ferry trip to Coron, Palawan. This allows divers to spend the weekend in Coron and take the Sunday night ferry trip back to Manila, arriving around noon. You can also stay on a Cruise Ship that’s exploring around the Coron area. The 7107 Island Cruise Ship [11] takes passangers around Coron and some of it’s private islands.

Ferry trips to other islands can take over 24 hours, depending on distance.

Other major ferry companies include: Sulpicio Lines, Negros Navigation, Trans Asia Shipping Lines, and Cebu Ferries.

Schedule Information is difficult to obtain–newspapers often contain pages with ads on certain days, but, believe it or not, most people rely on word-of-mouth. Boat Schedules and Directory: [12]

 Warning : If the boat appears to be over capacity, do not board. Always check the latest weather reports before travel by ferry, as some captains are willing to sail even when a typhoon is approaching. Bringing your own life preserver is strongly recommended (but no substitute for common sense). Travel by boat should not be considered safer than air travel.

Additional Resources [13]

By jeep

The jeepney is by far the most affordable way to get around most major urban areas. Remnants of the Jeep used by the American troops during World War II, the innovative Filipinos modified the jeep (by lengthening the body and adding horizontal seats) to seat as many as 20 people (10 per side). Within Manila, you will find multiple Jeepneys per route, for added convenience. In the provinces, Jeepneys also connect towns and cities. For longer distances, however, buses are more comfortable.

Also worthy of mention are the tricycles and the pedicabs (three-wheeled vehicle); however, this may not be to the liking of most foreigners, as these are cramped and quite open to traffic. These means of transport are also usually only used for very short distances.

 NOTE: The jeepneys, tricycles and pedicabs are meant for small people. Seating is cramped, even for locals, who are, on average, smaller by Western standards. Jeepney drivers/operators often insist on seating the vehicle to full capacity (say, nine per side) even if there’s a very large person seated. Consider this if you’re overweight or 6 feet or taller. Watch your head when boarding as the roof is low (compared to a bus). Also, drivers often don’t look to see if anyone is boarding before embarking. As you board, you need to evaluate every half second whether you’re going to abort or hang on to the vehicle if it starts to move. If you’re not in good physical shape, don’t even try it.

Talk

The Philippines has two official languages: English and Filipino . Filipino is mainly based on the Tagalog language (a relative of Malay), with heavy Spanish, Cebuano, Malay, Chinese (Hokkien), Hindi, Tamil, Sanskrit, Arabic, and American English influences.

Filipino is the language spoken in the Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog regions as well as the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila. In the Northern Luzon provinces, Ilocano is the most common language spoken. The provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga also have their own languages. Further south of Metro Manila lies the Bicol Region where Bikolano is used. In the Southern Islands of Visayas and Mindanao, Cebuano is the most common language spoken. Other minor languages in the south include Hiligaynon and Waray.

Although English is an official language of the Philippines and a compulsory subject in school, it is in practice used more often by the ABC1 class and it would be awkward if a Filipino speaks English to a fellow Filipino of the lower class. Tourists however won’t have problems using English when making inquiries from commercial and government establishments. A few simple phrases in Filipino will come in handy when traveling to rural places as English proficiency is limited there.

Many Spanish words survive in many of the local languages. Spanish is no longer widely understood. Nonetheless, Spanish is still spoken by a small Spanish ethnic minority, particularly older members who were educated when Spanish was used as the language of government and higher education. Younger Spanish-Filipinos tend to speak Filipino languages and/or English as their primary language.

There are some other ethnic groups who reside in the country, particularly in more urbanized areas like Manila. The biggest group is the Chinese, many of whom have assimilated with Filipino society. Take note however that since most of them come from Fujan province, they speak more Fukkien but learn Manadarin if sent to Chinese schools. Other groups include the Indians, Japanese, Arabs, Koreans, Americans and Europeans. In some cosmopolitan areas, there are establishments catering to Korean speakers.

Feast

The Philippines offers plenty of regional festivals, often linked to the feast of the patron saints of the town or city holding the festival. Parades and processions, marching bands, floats and dance displays are usual activities. A number of important festivals include the following:

 Black Nazarene –held in Quiapo Church Manila in January. Sinulog –held in Cebu City on the 3rd Sunday of January. Celebrating Sto. Niño, the Sinulog Festival includes a week of dancing, parades and celebration. Panagbenga –the flower festival held in Baguio every February Chinese New Year –celebrations coinciding with the coming of the Lunar new year, held in many urban areas, particularly in Chinatown in downtown Manila Ati-Atihan –also held to commemorate the feast of the Sto. Niño, but this time in Kalibo on the island of Panay. The Queen of Philippine Festivals and said to be the Filipino version of Mardi Gras. Moriones –held during the Lenten Season in Marinduque. These are passion plays meant to depict the crucifixion and eventual resurrection of Jesus Christ. Pahiyas –held every May in Lucban, Quezon to celebrate the feast day of San Isidro Labrador. There is a town-wide house decorating contest held during the festival. The colors and designs used are a feast for the eyes. Flores de Mayo –flower festival held in every May. Many towns celebrate Flores De Mayo with the community congregating in the afternoons to pray the rosary, offer flowers to the Virgin Mary, and share homemade delicacies and snacks. Children and adults wearing their Sunday best sing and dance to welcome the rains that will water the new crops. Kadayawan –held in Davao every August, Kadayawan means a Thanksgiving celebration for the good harvest, were most flowers and fruits are available during the season. Bangus Festival –not as popular as the other festivals. It is held annually in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. The usual events are a parade and 101 Ways to Cook Bangus. A“Longest Barbeque”was also held during the festival one year. Kagay-an Festival –held every August 26 to 28 in Cagayan de Oro in celebration of the feast day of Saint Augustine. Festivity highlight includes the Miss Kagay-an Tourism beauty pagent, Sakay-Sakay sa Lambago fluvial parade, street dancing in native costumes and the Golden Float parade. Zamboanga Hermosa Festival (Fiesta Pilar) 

October 3-12 Highlighted by the October 12 Fiesta Pilar in honor of the miraculous image of Our Lady of the Pillar at the legendary Fort Pilar. The festival features week-long novena masses, cultural shows, agricultural fairs, cutural exhibits, a two-day mardi gras parade, the bandoreal, a regatta, torch parades, fireworks, and carnivals. The festival commences with a solemn procession and a grand mass at the Fort. With thousands of pilgrims converging in Zamboanga City, this is the peninsula’s biggest festival.

Sun

Puka Beach on Boracay

Beaches can be found aplenty on this nation of 7,107 islands. These beaches come in all sorts of shapes, sizes and fineness of sand. Some are in well-secluded islands while others are just a short ride across a causeway from the city. Among the most notable are the following:

 Boracay –Boracay Island off the island of Panay has the White Beach. It is also one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It has fine, powdery white sand stretching on for several kilometers and is an excellent spot for sun-worshippers. Boracay also has several other lesser-known beaches. Outrigger boats to Boracay depart from Caticlan Port, just a short flight from Manila. 

 Mactan Island –in Cebu, the Cebu airport is actually on Mactan Island 

 Pagudpud–in Ilocos Norte, several hours north of Metro Manila 

 Panglao –small island off the island of Bohol, a short ride from the capital of Tagbilaran, which in turn is a short fast ferry ride from Cebu City. From Panglao, you can easily schedule an excursion to the Chocolate Hills for which Bohol is most known. 

 Puerto Galera –on the island of Mindoro. Ferries to Puerto Galera depart from Batangas Port, a couple of hours drive south of Metro Manila 

 Samal Island –off the coast of Davao 

 Camiguin Island –an island-province north of Mindanao. Also known as the Lanzones Capital of the Philippines, it can be reached directly by plane or ferry. 

 Sta. Cruz Island –Zamboanga City Great Santa Cruz island is known for it’s pink sand beach and sand bar, while the Little sta. cruz island is a typical white beach, with pulverized-like sand. It is also a diving site and is host to a lagoon. 

 Negros Island –Negros Occidental (north-western half of the island, in the Western Visayas region) offers fine white sand beaches, and nearby Danjugan Island Marine Reserve. Danjugan Island is bursting with thousands of species of marine life and home to the endangered White Breasted Eagle. Negros Oriental (south-eastern half of the island, in the Central Visayas region) is home to Dumaguete and numerous beach resorts in Dauin that can take you to Apo Island, one of the most magnificent diving spots in the Philippines. 

Learn

Scuba diving is spectacular in the Philippines. There is a great variety of dive sites and most if not all of these would have at least a handful of PADI accredited diving schools where you can obtain your license. Costs (of both lessons and equipment) are likely to be cheaper here compared to places like Australia, the Caribbean or even in nearby Thailand and Malaysia.

Do

The Philippines has several places where you can do Whitewater Rafting.

One of the best, if not the best, whitewater rafting experience can be had in Cagayan de Oro City, a city in the northern part of Mindanao.

Also, Davao is emerging as the“true”Whitewater rafting capital in Mindanao, if not in the Philippines.

Work

It is possible for foreigners to earn casual money whilst staying in the Philippines, especially in Manila and other bigger cities in provinces. These may include temporary teaching in schools, colleges and other institutions; and working in bars and clubs. Temporary work may also be available as an“extra”on the set of a film or television series. Fluency in English is very important in jobs even if knowledge of Filipino or Tagalog is considerably low.

Unlike other countries, there are no strict bureaucratic papers needed such as carte de sejours and NI IDs, so some formal jobs are not hard to come by and get. Do not expect large sums of money even for formal jobs. Wages are displayed on a per day basis rather than a per hour basis.

Most establishments pay out monthly but informal jobs pay out variably either cash on hand or weekly.

Buy

Money

The Philippine peso (PHP) is the official currency. One US dollar is equivalent to P44.85 (30 June 2008).

Peso bills come in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000. One peso is equivalent to 100 centavos and coins come in 5, 10 and 25 centavo variants in addition to the 1, 5 and 10 peso coins.

Money changers are not so common in the Philippines apart from some heavily touristed areas and most malls which usually have their own currency exchange stall. Banks on the other hand are widely available to exchange currency but usually impose a minimum amount and have limited hours of operation, usually from 9 AM to 3 PM on weekdays except BPI and BDO which have longer hours of operation.

Visitors can also use the 6,000 ATMs nationwide to withdraw funds or ask for cash advances. The three major local ATM consortia are BancNet, MegaLink and Expressnet. International networks, like PLUS and Cirrus, are accessible with many ATMs, but Cirrus is more predominant than PLUS; however, withdrawals are often limited to 5,000 pesos. An exception is HSBC where up to 50,000 pesos is possible.

Visitors who have a MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus card can withdraw funds or ask for cash advances at ATMs that display their logos. The most prominent MasterCard ATMs are the Express Tellers by BPI (Bank of the Philippine Islands) and the Smartellers by Banco de Oro.

PLUS ATMs are not available locally as a complement by itself, but instead it is available along with Cirrus. Prominent examples include the Fasteller by Equitable PCI Bank and the Electronic Teller (ET) by Metrobank. Most MegaLink ATMs are linked to PLUS and Cirrus.

Credit card holders can use VISA, MasterCard, American Express and JCB cards in many locations in the Philippines but merchants would usually require a minimum purchase amount before you can use your card. Cardholders of China UnionPay credit cards can get cash advances at many BancNet ATMs (particularly of Metrobank) but cannot use their cards in point of sale transactions at the moment.

Eat

Filipino cuisine has developed from the different cultures that shaped its history. As such it is a melange of Chinese, Malay, Indian, Arabic, Spanish and American influences. Though it is not as renowned as Thai and lately Vietnamese cuisine, Filipino cooking is nonetheless distinct in that it is possibly the least spicy of all South East Asian cuisines. Don’t make the mistake to think of Filipino food as bland, though. It is just that instead of spices, Filipino food depends more on garlic, onions and ginger to add flavor to dishes. Painstaking preparation and prolonged cooking time is also a characteristic of most Filipino dishes, and this often is what brings out the flavor of the food as opposed to a healthy dose of spices.

Filipinos usually eat with a spoon and fork, with the spoon held in the right hand and the fork used for pushing food onto the spoon but sometimes, Filipinos eat with their hands, usually on provinces and remote areas or when they are on a picnic and using banana leaves as their plates.

Rice

As with the rest of Southeast Asia, rice is the staple food of the Philippines. Some areas in the Visayas prefer corn but elsewhere Filipinos would generally have rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Uncooked rice usually comes in 50kg sacks but can be bought by the kilogram at the wet market or at neighborhood rice dealers. Single servings of rice are readily available at fastfood restaurants or eateries.

Mains

Filipinos usually serve at least one main course accompanied by rice for lunch and dinner. At times you would have two with a vegetable dish accompanying a meat dish. On special occasions such as fiestas, several main dishes would be served. Soups are also often the main course apart from being a starter. It is not uncommon for Filipinos to douse their rice with the soup and eat the meat that came with the soup alongside. Here are a few typical Filipino dishes:

 Adobo –chicken, pork or both served in a garlicky stew with vinegar and soy sauce as a base. Pansit –chicken, pork or shrimp mixed with rice noodles with variety of vegetables i.e. carrots, cabbage, celery, peapods etc. Sinigang –soup soured usually with tamarind (but can also be by guavas or kamias), can be served with pork, beef, chicken, fish or shrimp. Lengua –roasted beef tongue marinated in savory sauce Nilaga –literally means“boiled”, can be beef which in certain places is served with its marrow (bulalo), pork or chicken. Calamares –fried shrimp/squid wrapped in breading. Kare-kare –peanuty stew of vegetables and meat simmered for hours on end, usually beef with tripe and tail and eaten with a side of shrimp paste (bagoong). There is also a seafood version of kare-kare with crabs, squid and shrimp instead of beef. Camaron Rebusado –the Filipino version of tempura. Lechon de leche –slow-roasted baby pork, usually served during larger occasions. The crispy skin is delicious and is often the first part that is consumed. Daing na bangus –fried dried milkfish, usually served for breakfast with garlic fried rice and fried egg. Pakbet –a traditional meal of mixed vegetables usually containing cut tomatoes, minced pork, lady finger, eggplant, etc. Dinuguan –a dark stew of pig’s blood mixed with its innards. Usually served with a big green chili and best eaten with puto. Bopis –pork innards, usually served spicy. 

Snacks

Filipinos love to snack. Merienda is what Filipinos call their mid-morning and mid-afternoon meals. Some favorite snack time meals include:

 Bibingka –rice cake with cheese and salted egg. Halo-halo –literally means“mixed”, fruit, sweets, crushed ice, milk, beans, and sometimes ice cream. Similar to the ice kachang served in Malaysia and Singapore. Balut –is a fertilized duck egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside that is boiled and eaten in the shell. Popularly believed to be an aphrodisiac and considered a high-protein, hearty snack, baluts are mostly sold by street vendors at night in the regions where they are available. Boiled and usually eaten with a sprinkle of salt and vinegar. Penoy –same as balut, but without the embryo, just the yolk. Buko pie –pie made with fresh coconut flesh. The province of Laguna has numerous roadside buko pie stores, with several of them claiming to be the home of the“original”buko pie. Pandesal –small buns usually made fresh in the morning, usually an alternative to rice for breakfast. It is usually eaten with a cup of coffee. Some people prefer to dip their pandesal in coffee. Banana cue –a popular street food made of saba bananas fried in very hot oil with caramelized sugar coating. The saba bananas can also be boiled instead of fried. Fishballs –more popularly known to Filipinos as“fishballan”they usually come in vendor stands and are sold deep-fried along with squidballs, chickenballs and kikiam. Some stands also sell“isaw”(chicken innard), siomai (steamed dumpling),“kwekkwek”(boiled quail egg in orange coating), and“betamax”(dried and cubed pig’s blood). A stick may sell from P5 to P10. Isaw sticks usually sell for P2. Puto –a general term for rice cake, they usually come as soft white rice muffins or pie-shaped desserts. Other kinds include Biko, Cuchinta, Pichi-Pichi, Sapin-Sapin, etc. The towns of Calasiao in Pangasinan and Binan, Laguna are famous for their puto. Chicharon –crunchy snacks made from deep-fried pig skin. 

Fruits&amp;Desserts

Tropical fruits abound in the Philippines. Most of the countryside produce finds its way to the metro areas and can be easily bought in supermarkets, such as:

 Green, ripe, and dried mangoes –Philippine mangoes are among the best in the world. ‘Durian’–smells like hell but supposedly tastes of heaven, most common in Davao but can usually also be bought in some supermarkets in Manila. 

Desserts/ Sweets:

 ‘Sampaloc candy’- salted and sweetened tamarind fruit ‘Mais con Hielo’- a dessert of fresh sweet corn served in a glass mixed with crushed ice and milk. ‘Halo-Halo’–another refreshing dessert which is a mix of sweetened beans and fruits, such as sweetened bananas, red and white beans, sago, crushed ice and milk and topped off with leche flan and ube jam and/or ice cream ‘Leche Flan’–custard flan made from eggs, milk and sugar 

McDonald’s, Dairy Queen, Burger King, Wendy’s, KFC, Shakey’s, Pizza Hut, Kenny Roger’s Roasters, Sbarro’s, Starbucks, Seattle’s Best, Subway and other multinational fast food chains have established themselves in the Philippines. The Philippine version of McDonald’s, Jollibee, has a branch in almost every city and town in the country. Other popular Filipino food chains are Chow King, Goldilock’s, and Greenwich.

Drink

Sunset during Happy Hour on Boracay

Metro Manila is home to many bars, watering holes, and karaoke sites. Popular places include Makati (particularly the Glorietta and Greenbelt areas), Ortigas Metrowalk, and Eastwood in Libis. Other big cities such as Cebu City and Davao also have areas where the nightlife is centered. Establishments serve the usual hard and soft drinks typical of bars elsewhere. Note that Filipinos rarely consume alcohol by itself. They would normally have what is called as“pulutan”or bar chow alongside their drinks which is like the equivalent of tapas. At the least, this would consist of mixed nuts but selections of grilled meats and seafood are not uncommon food alongside the customary drinks. When having a party, Filipinos enjoy drinking round-robin style using a common glass. One is supposed to drink bottoms-up before passing the glass to the next person. This custom is known as“tagayan”and one person usually volunteers to pour the drink.

Beer is perhaps the most common form of alcohol consumed in bars. San Miguel Beer is the dominant local brand with several variants such as Light, Dry, Strong Ice and their flagship variant Pale Pilsen. Budweiser, Heineken and Corona can also be found in upscale bars. Rhum and“ginebra”which is the local form of gin are commonly available forms of hard liquor. Indigenous forms of liquor are lambanog and tuba which are both derived from coconut sap. Tuba is fermented from the coconut sap and though tuba itself can be drunk, it is also distilled to take the form of lambanog. Lambanog is now being marketed widely both locally and internationally in its base form as well as in several flavored variants such as mango, bubble gum and blueberry.

Alcohol is extremely cheap in the Philippines (and probably cheapest in the whole of Asia). For a bottle of San Miguel bought at a 7-11 or Mini-Stop, a bottle would costs about PhP20-PhP30 (About USD 0.50). For top-end bars and clubs, a bottle would costs about PhP100.00-PhP200 (about USD 2.50-5.00). A bottle of 750ml Absolut Vodka at the supermarket would fetch a price of around PhP750.00 and a popular local rhum (especially amongst knowledgeable expats) Tanduay would get you just below PhP70.00 at a 24 hour convenience store in Makati (The Financial District).

Of course non-alcoholic drinks are also widely available in bars and other establishments. Don’t miss:

 ‘Calamansi Juice’–lemon juice made from small, local lemons called calamansi ‘Fresh Buko Juice’- juice extracted from young coconuts ‘Sago’t Gulaman–a sweet drink of molasses, tapioca pearls and seaweed gelatin ‘Green mango shake- a fruit shake made of green or unripened mangoes, sugar, milk and ice(one of the best native drinks in the Philippines) Taho –a sweet, warm soya snack usually served in the morning, with tapioca balls, soft tofu and caramelized syrup 

Sleep

Housing options for tourists include hotels, condotels, apartelles, motels, inns/bed-and-breakfasts, and pension houses.

Hotels are usually for the higher-end traveller, although hotel rates–even for four-star establishments–are not very high compared to other international destinations. Condotels are furnished condominium units rented out for long or short term stays, apartelles are set up for both short and long term stays, and a pension house is usually more basic and economical. These all vary in terms of cleanliness, availability of air conditioning, and hot water showers. Motels, inns, and lodges also serve lodging purposes but have a reputation as meeting places for illicit sex, a unit being usually a small room with a connected carport, hidden behind a high wall which provides for secret comings and goings. You can distinguish these by their hourly rates, while more reputable institutions usually have daily rates.

Stay safe

Don’t flash around valuables like mp3 players, jewelry, and cellphones because they pose a pickpocketing threat. Pickpockets are really common in the big cities of the Philippines. On the other hand, Manila is one of the safest cities in the Southeast Asian region. Manila is not a place for violent robbery, but the attivan scam is common practice. Innocent looking persons, that befriend you put a drug in your drink that knocks you out right away. They can drag you to a waiting car, saying that you have drunk too much and strip or rape you or even take your kidneys and dump you. It will take 10 hours to wake up and you can be dizzy and short of memory for 3 days. Don’t expect any reprisal from police. They have their own scam and will be waiting for foreign currency.

See also common scams and pickpockets.

Prostitution

Prostitution is thriving but officially and nationally illegal in the Philippines, although hostess bars, massage parlors and other opportunities abound which offer this service. The age of consent is 18. Penalties for sex with minors are harsh, and offenders may also be prosecuted by their home country.

Stay healthy

Drink the readily available bottled water. Buko (young coconut) juice is also safe if they have not added local ice to it. Be wary also of Buko juice vendors, some usually just add sugar to water. Buy and eat fruit that has not already been cut up. Cooked food from a karenderia (outdoor canteen) is okay if there is a fire under the pots and the food has been kept hot.

If you must drink tap water (it is usually served/contained in a small to medium plastic bag), water in Manila, Cebu City, Subic, and Angeles may be ok, but it is recommended that you boil tap water for at least 5 minutes just to be safe. Elsewhere drink bottled water. There is always the risk of contracting amoebiasis when drinking tap water in the countryside. Also, this applies to ice that is usually put in beverages.

Bottled water is best purchased from within stores and sheltered eateries. Bottled waters sold outside (by the roads) are more than likely used bottles filled with tap water, sealed then cooled.

CDC [15] advises that risk of malaria exists in areas below 600 meters, except for the provinces of Aklan, Bilaran, Bohol, Camiguin, Capiz, Catanduanes, Cebu, Guimaras, Iloilo, Leyte, Masbate, northern Samar, Sequijor, and metropolitan Manila. NB: chloroquine is no longer a recommended malaria preventative for anywhere in the Philippines. In general malaria is not common in the Philippines and around half of the c. 40,000 annual cases are in a couple of discrete locations.

Also please note the tubercolosis is very common in the countryside, it is advisable not to stay in certain villages in areas you are not familiar with for a very long time. It is also higly advisable that if one coughs or looks weak in strength it is highly advisable to avoid contact with that person.

Bring anti-diarrheal drugs with you, as unsanitary conditions present a high risk for traveler’s diarrhea.

Although the Philippines is a low HIV prevalence country, it still pays to take precaution. Other sexually transmitted diseases are common.

Cope

Electricity

Most of the Philippines is 220 Volt 60 Hz with the older 2-prong plug formerly used in the USA (not polarized or grounded). This is not a common voltage-frequency combination, so nearly everyone will have to pay close attention to what they plug in to an electric outlet. Americans will need a step-down transformer, while Europeans and Australians cannot use electric clocks and heavy-duty 50 Hz motors. Also, they will need a passive plug adaptor intended for USA/Canada. Americans will need one too for any plug where one blade is wider than the other (polarized), or has a third round grounding pin. It’s best also to bring such items that work universally such as those electronics marked with a 100V-240V 50/60hz compatibility to avoid voltage concerns.

Downtown Baguio (northern Luzon) uses 110 V @ 60 Hz like USA, but doesn’t go very far beyond the city center. The airport, for example, is 220V. If staying in the Baguio area, always ask first! If your equipment is 110-125V, merely crossing a street corner can cause it to be damaged or even catch fire. There are no signs in Baguio indicating where 110V ends and 220V begins.

Television and Video

Television and video in the Philippines use the NTSC format, which is the same as the USA and Canada. Televisions sets and VCRs made for Japan (though the same video format) will skip certain channels. Region Coded DVDs are Region 3 (SE Asia), though virtually all Tagalog movies are region free. There are two major networks in the Philippines–ABS-CBN and GMA.

Respect

A little courtesy goes a long way. Filipinos are a very friendly and hospitable people, sometimes even to a fault. Take the time to smile and say“thank you”, and you’ll receive much better responses. You will receive an even better response if you throw in a little Tagalog, such as“salamat”, which means“thank you”. When talking to the people older than you in Filipino, it is greatly appreciated to include“po”in your sentences such as“salamat po”. In the countryside and in some urban homes, footwear is removed when entering a home, though they may make an exception for foreigners. The key is to look around before entering any home. If you see footwear just outside the door, more than likely the family’s practice is to remove footwear before entering. If you wear socks, you don’t have to remove them.

 Street Children 

In many of the larger cities extreme poverty is prevalent. I advise not to give money to beggars or the street children who run around at all hours. Any money you give them will usually end up with their family members who will spend it on alcoholic drinks or gambling. If you’d like to offer them something, after your meal in a nice restaurant, ask the waiter to put any surplus food from your meal into a‘doggie’bag. Offer this food to a street child instead of cash. This way the child benefits by getting a meal!

Contact

The country code for the Philippines is 63. The area code for Metro Manila is 2.

GSM mobile phones are in wide use all over the country, however iDEN network is also somewhat present (service is provided by Next Mobile, a subsidiary of Nextel). 3G technology is also available through Globe and Smart. In most urban locations and many resorts, cell phone service will be available. The average cost of an international long-distance call to the United States and other major countries is 40 US cents per minute (approximately 18 pesos), with national calls ranging from 6.50 to 7.50 pesos (approximately 14 to 17 US cents) per minute. Text messages cost 50 centavos (a little over 1 US cent) and the Philippines is usually tagged as the“texting capital of the world”.

The three major telecommunications companies are Globe Telecom, PLDT (wireless subsidiary Smart Communications for mobile phones) and Sun Cellular. If you are visiting the Philippines, it is wise to check your mobile carrier to see if they offer international roaming for your plan and if so, which of the three carriers do they partner with and you will need at least a dualband GSM mobile phone.

Pre-paid SIM cards of these networks are easy to acquire and cost as low as P30 (approximately 70 US cents) and provide a cheap alternative to (usually) expensive roaming charges on home networks. If your unit is locked to your home service provider, cellphone repair shops in various malls have ways of unlocking. If you don’t have a phone to begin with, a complete pre-paid kit with phone and SIM could be had for as low as 2 to 3 thousand pesos (US$40 to 60). Note that the phones that come with these kits would usually be locked to the local network provider. You would also need to have it unlocked before leaving if you plan on using it back home.

Reloading pre-paid SIMs is a breeze. Electronic Load (E-Load) stations are everywhere from small corner stores to the large malls where you just give your mobile phone number and the amount you wish to load (Globe, Smart and Sun each have their load denominations to choose from for E-loading). If you have a friend using the same mobile operator as you, you can load as little as a few pesos by letting him/her pass on some of his/her load to you and if you need hundreds of pesos worth of load, you can purchase pre-paid cards which are available in denominations of 300 and 500 pesos (approximately US$7 and 12 respectively).

Due to the wide use of mobile phones, pay phones are increasingly becoming obsolete. Some malls and public places still do have them and they usually come in either the coin or card operated variety. Globe and PLDT are the usual operators. Phone cards are usually sold by shops which sell cellphone pre-paid loads and cards. Note that phone cards of one company can not be used with the other company’s card operated phones.

Internet access areas of broadband speeds are plentiful in city malls, much less so outside the cities, but are growing at a rapid pace. Some of these shops offer an alternative to the traditional overseas phone calls by use of their VOIP networks. Internet surfing rates depend primarily on where you surf and the medium used (e.g. WiFi or wired). Internet services offered by hotels and shopping malls are expensive and can go up to P200/hour (approximately US$5) but neighbourhood cafes can be as cheap as P15/hour (approximately US$0.35). WiFi service in the Philippines is provided by Airborneaccess.net and WiZ is likely to cost P100 (approximately US$2) for up to an hour. Coffee shops like Starbucks and Seattle’s Best as well as malls usually carry WiFi service (check the link [16] for the full list). Certain areas may carry free WiFi.

Apart from the Philippine postal service, FedEx, UPS, and DHL courier services are also available. Local couriers such as LBC and Aboitiz are also available.

 Papua New Guinnea 
 Posted on December 16, 2008 by admin 
 Papua New Guinea is an island nation in Oceania.

Regions

PNG has 11 regions (7 on the main island and 4 island regions):

 Bougainville Highlands–includes Enga Province, Chimbu Province and the Southern, Western and Eastern Highlands Huon Gulf–Morobe province Madang (region) Manus Island Milne Bay New Britain New Ireland Central and North–includes the city of Port Moresby and the Central and Northern provinces Sepik–includes the West and East Sepik provinces South-western provinces–includes the Western and Gulf provinces 

Destinations

 The capital city of Port Moresby, with its interesting Zoological gardens, the Parliament building, the museum, and general Melanesian atmosphere. 

 The island of New Britain, home of heart-rendingly beautiful diving and Rabaul, the city at the foot of a volcano. 

 Mt. Hagen, the‘wild-west’frontier town in the Highlands which will introduce you to the cool, crisp highlands weather and Highlands culture 

 ‘Beautiful Madang’–a city with breath-taking flights of bats in the evening (it’s illegal to hurt them), and yet more breathtaking diving. 

 Wewak,‘the gateway to the Sepik’, where you can experience Sepik culture, the river itself, and the elaborate carvings typical of the region. 

 Kokoda Track 

Understand

Papua New Guinea (known popularly as‘PNG’)–the eastern half of the island of New Guinea (which is the second largest island in the world)–was divided between Germany (‘German New Guinea’) and Great Britain (‘British Papua’) in 1884. The Dutch had West Papua, now the Indonesia territory of Western New Guinea. Papua was owned by the UK but administered by Australia–and thus a colony of a colony–until Australian independence, when in 1906 it became an Australian colony. In 1914 the Australians did their part in the Allied war effort and took control of German New Guinea, and continued to administer it as a Trust Territory under the League of Nations and (later) the United Nations.

During World War II New Guinea was the site of fierce fighting on land (at Buin and on the Kokoda Track) and sea (at the Battle of the Coral Sea)–it was the first place in the war where the Japanese advance was checked and then reversed. After the war, both New Guinea and Papua were administered from the government center of Port Moresby on the south coast, in Papua. In 1975, the country–now united as‘Papua New Guinea’–achieved independence from Australia. Today Papua New Guinea continues to be the foremost country in Melanesia. The country struggles to fulfill the dreams of independence as economic stagnation, corruption, law and order problems, and a nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville.

Papua New Guinea offers the traveler a true paradox. With little to no tourist infrastructure, getting around can be tough. Illness and crime are also obviously a problem in a place without a well-developed health care system or a strong police force. But Papua New Guineans themselves are wonderfully welcome people who will go to great lengths to accommodate strangers. Don’t be under any illusion–apart from a very few, very expensive package tours, PNG is 120% adventure travel and not for the inexperienced or faint of heart.

But then again, not every traveler is inexperienced or faint of heart, and for people who can make it out to PNG, the experience is unforgettable. PNG’s incredible natural beauty is simply indescribable. Its unique flora and fauna includes enormous radiations of marsupials and birds, including the Raggiana bird-of-paradise (PNG’s national symbol) and several species of tree kangaroos. Untouched coral reefs compete with spectacular WWII wrecks for the attention of divers, and the hiking is out of control.

The central highlands of Papua New Guinea were not mapped until the 1930s and not effectively brought under government control until the late 1960s. As a result, the people of PNG are even more interesting than the countryside. Papua New Guinea is a place that often markets itself as‘the Last Unknown’or a place where you can still find‘Stone Age People’. Of course, telling a Papua New Guinean that you consider them a stone age savage is incredibly rude. And while you can–if you try hard enough–find old men who remember the first time they or anyone in their society saw metal you’ll also have trouble finding anyone who hasn’t seen Titanic. Indeed, what makes Papua New Guinea so interesting today is not the fact that it is some sort of living museum, but its incredible dynamism. In the hundred-year shift from stone to steel to silicon, Papua New Guineans have turned the shortest learning curve in human history into one of the most colorful–and often idiosyncratic–experiments in modernity ever produced by human being. Featuring ritual garb made of human hair and rolled up Instant Noodle wrappers, rap in Pidgin English, or tribal warriors named‘Rambo’for their valor in combat, Papua New Guinea’s collision with global culture has been intense and fascinating. So don’t worry about the fate of‘traditional culture’–in the bar-room brawl between PNG and the global culture industry our biggest worry is keeping PNG from pummeling global culture to a pulp.

Get In

By plane

Air Niugini flies to and from Cairns, Sydney, and Brisbane, Australia; Honiara, Solomon Islands; Manila, Philippines; Tokyo (Narita), Japan; Singapore and Hong Kong. Airlines of Papua New Guinea flies to and from Cairns, and Brisbane.

By boat

PNG’s ports include Madang, Lae, and Port Moresby on the mainland, Kieta on Bougainville, Rabaul on New Britain.

By land

The only land border is with Western New Guinea, Indonesia, and crossing it involves some preparations but is not that difficult as it might have been. In Jayapura, Indonesia you’ll find a PNG consulate to apply for a tourist visa.

Depending on your Indonesian visa there are different options to cross the border.

If you have a Visa-on-Arrival, issued to you for example at the Jakarta Airport, you can only cross the border using a boat. Boats can be rented from Hamedi.

Any other type of visa you can rent a car, or an ojek and cross the landborder.

Get around

By car

Papua New Guinea is a strange place when it comes to travel. The tropical conditions, fierce geography, and lack of government capacity means there are very few paved roads in the country. With the exception of a brief span of road connecting it to the immediate hinterland, there are no major roads linking Port Moresby to any other city. On the north coast, a tenuous highway theoretically runs from Madang to Wewak.

The big exception to this is the Highlands Highway, which begins in Lae (the country’s main port) and runs up into the highlands through Goroka to Mt. Hagen. Shortly outside Mt. Hagen the road branches, with southern line going through the Southern Highlands to Tari while the northern line runs through Enga province and ends in Porgera.

By Public Motor Vehicles (PMV)

It is also possible to travel via bus/PMV, which is the preferred way of travelling by the locals. From Lae Madang, Goroka and Mount Hagen can easily be reached. As a newcomer it is probably advisable to get help from locals ( e.g. , hotel-staff). Most towns have several starting points. A trip from Lae to Madang costs between 20 Kina, to Hagen 30 Kina.

By plane

Papua New Guinea has historically been one of the world centers for aviation and still features some of the most spectacular flying in the world. In the 1920s, Lae was the busiest airport in the world–it was there that aviators in the gold mining industry first proved that it was commercially feasible to ship cargo (and not just people) by air. In fact, Lae was where Amelia Earhart set off on her last journey.

Air transport is still the most common way to get around between major urban centers–indeed, pretty much every major settlement is built around an airstrip. In fact, the main drag of Mt. Hagen is the old airstrip! Travel from the coast into the highlands is particularly spectacular (don’t take your eyes off the window for a second!) and pilots from America, Australia, and other countries work in PNG at reduced salaries just for the great flying. If you don’t like small planes (or even smaller helicopters!) however, flying in PNG may not be the best option for you.

By boat

People living in PNG’s archipelagos get around locally with the ubiquitous banana boat–a thirty or forty foot fiberglass hull with an outboard motor. In addition, two or three shipping lines also sell tickets for passengers who want to leapfrog from one city to another. One small ship leaves the city of Lae once a week, stopping at Finschhafen and Umboi Island. Sleeping on the open deck of a ship as it crawls slowly through the South Pacific night is about as romantic as it sounds, but beware–it gets cold on the open ocean no matter where you are, so come with some warm clothes or buy a room indoor.

Talk

With over 700 languages with names like Asaro, Gahuku, Tairora, and Podopa (or Folopa), it can be pretty difficult to get everyone talking to each other. Two pidgins grew up in this area, Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu, and when the Anglophones married the Hulis and the babies learned the only language they have in common, Tok Pisin became a creole. Tok Pisin sometimes looks like it’s English written phonetically (“Yu dring, yu draiv, yu dai”), but it isn’t; it has more personal pronouns than English and its own quite different syntax.

Tok Pisin is spoken in most of the country. Hiri Motu is spoken in Port Moresby and other parts of Papua, though since Port Moresby is the capital, you’re likely to find Tok Pisin speakers in the airport, banks, or government. When approaching locals, try to speak English first; using Tok Pisin or another language can make it look like you are assuming they don’t know English.

You might sometimes have trouble hearing what the locals are saying because they speak very quietly. It is considered rude by some of the local groups to look people in the eyes and to speak loudly.

Buy

There is not so much shopping in the regular sense to be had in PNG. In the major cities there are a few malls and supermarkets. Otherwise most of the shopping is done in small markets that are held at irregular intervals. A great place to visit is the craft market which is held once per month in Port Moresby down by Ela beach, there it is possible to buy handicrafts from basically every part of the Island. Although it is slightly more expensive than out in the villages, the prices are very reasonable. Haggling is not really an accepted custom, one can haggle a bit but to do it excessively could annoy the locals.

Eat

PNG food is largely devoid of spices. A typical way of cooking is a mumu , an underground oven in which meat and vegetables, such as kaukau (sweet potatoes), are cooked.

Drink

Papua New Guineans are fond of their local beers–or indeed any beers for that matter. The local brew, SP (short for South Pacific) Lager, is owned by Heineken.

While the water quality varies from place to place (and in some cases from day to day), it is generally best to stick to bottled water, even in the upper-market hotels.

Sleep

Papua New Guinea offers a wide choice of accommodation for tourists. Port Moresby has international hotels including the Crown Plaza and Airways International, mid range hotels such as Lamana and guest houses. The regional areas offer International and budget hotels depending on the size of the town and some provinces have guest houses. There is a new eco-tourist lodge in Alotau called Ulumani Treetops Lodge, the place is beautiful overlooking the Milne Bay and offers a new bungalow or backpacker options.

Learn

Newspapers

Papua New Guinea has two daily newspapers that include up-to-date exchange rates and other important information:

 The Post Courier (‘the Post’) The National The National 

There is also a fortnightly PNG Gossip Electronic Newsletter that provides information about the country for any prospective visitor. Not all the news is factual as it is supposed to be a gossip newsletter, but is well worth a look.

 PNG Gossip The PNG Gossip Electronic Newsletter 

Books

There are many great books about Papua New Guinea, including great fiction as well as non-fiction. An excellent book for the general reader about Papua New Guinea is Sean Dorney’s Papua New Guinea: People, Politics, and History Since 1975 . The third edition is the best, but it’s pretty hard to find outside of Australia (and is not that easy to find there).

John Laurel Ryan, a former employee of the ABC, also wrote an excellent book,“The Hot Land”which was published about 1970. Among other fascinating historical information it contains accounts of various manifestations of cargo cult, John Teosin’s“baby garden”on Buka Island, and eye-witness reports that have been rigidly suppressed in other media about the Indonesian takeover of what was formerly Dutch West Papua. This excellent and at times disturbing book will also be hard to find, and sadly its author even harder!

Work

Stay safe

PNG has a reputation as a risky destination in some circles. This is due predominantly to the activities of criminal gangs (known in Tok Pisin as raskols ) in major cities, especially in Port Moresby. Raskolism is generally a result of unemployment stemming from increased domestic migration from subsistence farming in the hills to the nearest urban area. Some towns in the highlands, such as Tari, are in fact effectively lawless as the police presence has been discontinued.

If you are planning a trip to PNG, the most important thing is to stay up to date on the law and order situation in the locations you are planning to visit. Most hotels in Port Moresby are secure and situated inside compounds, generally with armed guards patrolling the perimeter. Don’t be alarmed, as actual gunfire in the capital is mercifully rare. If planning on taking a tour of any city, make inquiries with your hotel or accommodation provider, as many will be able to drive you to wherever you are planning to go, or just around the local area if that is what you want to do.

Stay very alert after dark if you are outside a compound, which is somewhere you should only be in the rarest circumstances. Beware of driving at night and avoid pedestrian crossing as car hijacking are well planned. Female travellers should take extra precautions, although reports vary as to whether the capital or regional centres are safer for solo female travellers. PNG is also reputatable of looting&amp;scavanging during crisis. Criminal also prey on victims by dressing in police uniform. Union workers going on strike&amp;public facilities like roads, hospital, prison, police force, telecommunication, water and electric power were distrubted by the workers and landowners to extend demand.

 Saltwater Crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus ) are very common in Papua New Guinea and are capable of growing to immense lengths of 8 meters or more (although individuals over 6 meters are very rare). They can and do occasionally devour humans and should be shown respect at all times. They are equally at home in coastal waters as they are in freshwater lakes and rivers. Swimming is generally not advised except at higher elevations and in hotel swimming pools. Papua New Guinea, along with Australia, has the highest and healthiest population of large Saltwater Crocodiles in the world.

Stay healthy

Tap water in some regions can be unsafe to drink.

Malaria can be a hazard as well, although many villages–particularly those connected to industry–are regularly treated for mosquitoes. Take the appropriate precautions against mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases.

Respect

As in many Melanesian cultures, greeting people with a friendly handshake is very important. Be aware, however, that it is a sign of respect not to make eye contact when this is being done. The sight of hotel staff calling you by name, shaking your hand and looking respectfully at the floor is an unusual one at first, but one you will soon get used to.
