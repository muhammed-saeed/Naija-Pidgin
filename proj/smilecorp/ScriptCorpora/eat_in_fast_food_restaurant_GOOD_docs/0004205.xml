Think anything goes at a fast food restaurant? Think again. Just like any business or eating establishment, rules need to be followed. The rule of etiquette in a fast food restaurant adheres to employees and customers alike.

However, those rules are often broken by cantankerous customers and snippy employees. Such behavior can lead to two things: The employee getting fired or the customer getting kicked out of the establishment. How can such problems be avoided? Surprisingly, it’s simple; use a little common sense, patience and cordiality.
 
Fast food etiquette is not a super secret technique for better business; it’s simply how the employees and customers interact with each other and behave themselves. These are things that are taught in pre-school. Yet, the problem arises because somebody forgets that rule. When the two groups respect each other - and mind their manners–the transaction between one’s service and other’s purchasing power is as simple as flipping the burgers.

Since there are usually two groups–customer and employee–involved in the fast food business, a close examination of each group’s role needs to be examined (for the time being, the manager will be left out of this discussion. He or she will have to act as a ref when matters between these two groups flair up. Hopefully, it will never get to that point). 

EMPLOYEE ETIQUETTE

There are few things an employee needs to understand: they represent a company, and they are helping to sell a product and service to the customer. They may be behind the cashier machine or cooking and preparing the food. Either way, they are serving the customers.

First, an employee needs to take care of hygiene. Keep the hair in a hat or net. Customers don’t find strands of hair on the menu, nor do they want to spend the entire time in the restaurant picking through the food or pulling strands out of their mouths. Also, it is important to wash one’s hands, keep your nose clean and avoid coughing on the food. Customers getting hives, fevers, and other forms of food poisoning don’t exactly reflect well on the company, let alone the worker.

Second, be polite and cheerful (don’t need to be too cheerful; that’d be counterproductive and annoying). Take the orders, listen to the request and quickly respond in a calm manner when complaints arise. Always be helpful, instead of spiteful.

Third, be patient. Work long enough in a fast
