 REVIEW: Zest Cafe&amp;Home Art–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on April 26, 2012 
 
Image via Zest Cafe&amp;Home Art&apos;s Facebook Page
 
I went out to Zest Cafe&amp;Home Art on Six Forks Road in Raleigh the other day for a quick bite to eat with my mom who was passing through Raleigh. She said she was feeling a sandwich or a salad and I had heard a lot about Zest’s lunch menu and decided to  head over with her to check it out.

I  had been hearing good things from a variety of people about the food at Zest Cafe ranged from catered hor d’oeuvres (which I had tried at a party before) to the brunch menu and the sandwich menu. The sandwiches played their part in getting me there and Urbanspoon was the other force in getting me there with its very mom-friendly reviews for Zest. Additionally, there was a bit of a guilty force working on me because one of my good buddies from college manages the restaurant and I have been living in Raleigh for about 9 months and still hadn’t been out there yet! Don’t worry. It didn’t alter my review of the place at all.

The restaurant was packed with a 15 minute wait for a 2-top on the outside patio but we were able to snag a table inside right when we got there. Some of the Urbanspoon and Yelp reviewers are right in the sense that the restaurant is a little tight especially during the lunch or dinner rush. A packed environment is something that doesn’t really bother me unless it is bar or Wal-Mart. The crowd was a mixture of business lunches, families and housewives. Everyone was talking but we had no trouble talking or hearing each other over them.

 

 

I ordered the hoisin braised short rib panini which is topped with caramelized onions, provolone cheese and tomato cruda on the house flatbread with a ramekin of Zest’s sweet&amp;spicy steak sauce. I am always a little hesitant to order a panini at restaurants because I feel like many places tend to short you on the filling. This was not the case at Zest. My panini was loaded with short rib meat and smothered in provolone cheese and tomato cruda. The first bite put a smile on my face and it stayed there throughout the meal and afterwards until I had to go back to work. The short rib was thinly sliced and had dynamite flavor of hoisin. The sandwich was delicious by itself but once I dipped it in the steak sauce, I didn’t try another bite without it.

The side of pasta salad was a welcome change from the world of steak sandwiches served with fries plus a side of ranch which is the dish of choice if you are living the current American dream.

 

My mom ordered the“Select”salad which is a blend of mixed greens with Black Mission figs, fresh pears, crumbled blue cheese, toasted walnuts and a raspberry balsamic vinaigrette. She added a grilled chicken breast for $3 to make it a little more filling. I didn’t get to try it but she told me that really enjoyed it.

NOTE: The Splenda was for the tea and not the salad. One thing that you should know before going into Zest is that they do not offer sweet tea which one Urbanspoon user decried as“blasphemous”. However, they do have a raspberry tea which a different user says makes up for it.

Zest has a boutique that you can shop around in before, during or after lunch with a variety of things ranging from kitchenware to artwork to a puppet show. The items they sell in the boutique aren’t particularly my cup of tea. Think chic with lots of polka dots and floral designs.  That said, I did end up buying a belt for my sister-in-law’s birthday thanks to the help from Amanda which received the compliment (I think…) from my sister-in-law of“Who knew you had such good taste in ladies clothing?!”Thanks AK…

The menu had a lot of other items that I wanted to try the quesadilla with poblano peppers&amp;sweet potatoes or the tortilla crusted catfish sandwich. The Asian spring rolls and sesame chicken with lo mein also peaked my interest. However, I will probably be ordering the short rib panini again because it was so damn good. The brunch menu also has a lot of interesting items like the Quadrant (2 any style eggs, 2 griddlecakes of the day with warm syrup, zest mix roasted chipotle-herb potatoes and a ramekin of southern style cheese grits) or the brunch fritatta (grilled mahi and manchego cheese topped with fresh avocado and cilantro pesto served with mixed green salad and fresh fruit).

Zest is located near I-540 not far off from the Six Forks Road exit so it could be a good lunch stop if you are headed to the coast and not trying to eat at chains which you probably are if you are reading this blog. Stop by and check it out and tell Ben&amp;Amanda that I sent you!

 REVIEW: Battistella’s–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on March 27, 2012 
 
 

 Battistella’s is one of the latest addition to list of restaurants at Moore’s Square in downtown Raleigh on Martin Street.It is run by Chef Brian Battistella who previously operated Battistella’s New Orleans Kitchen out of the Crabtree Inn. He gained a strong following in the Raleigh area and decided to move to a more prominent location in downtown.

I’ve been on the lookout for some good NOLA ( N ew O rleans, LA for those that aren’t familiar) food ever since I took a road trip down there for a long weekend bachelor party ( see the post from my food adventures down there ). Before that trip, the closest tastes that I got to New Orleans cuisine was out of a box at Zatarain’s or from the drive-thru window at Popeye’s Chicken&amp;Biscuits. Don’t judge me. I am making amends and thank goodness I have a place like Battistella’s to help me through the process.

Battistella’s is closed on Mondays but is open from Tuesday through Saturday (11a–2p for lunch; 5:30p–10:30p for dinner) and Sundays for brunch (10:30a–3:30p). They are serving a variety of different dishes from crawfish étouffée to Louisiana Crawfish Cornbread Stuffed Georgia Quail which sounds pretty damn good. They also have a po’boy menu with various styles including the artery-clogging  french fry with brown gravy po‘boy which I haven’t had a chance to try yet.

 

I made it down to Battistella’s for the first time since it opened back in September for brunch with my buddy, Bryan. It was a bit of a cloudy day outside but we were able to sit on the sidewalk and enjoy lunch with about 20 other diners with the same idea. Luckily, we were able to snag the last remaining 2-top outside and enjoy the nice weather while getting our brunch on.

Bryan ordered the jambalaya (above) which had andouille sausage and chicken plus the trinity of 25% celery, 25% peppers and 50% onions which is commonly found in the cuisine around New Orleans and then mixed with some Cajun rice which may or may not have been Louisana popcorn rice. The stock had a lot of flavor at the bottom and made for a great spicy dish jambalaya that Bryan needed after taking down multiple PBR tallboys the night before. I tried a bite and thought it was fantastic with a subtle spiciness that didn’t overpower the taste and loved the fact that they didn’t skimp on andouille or chicken. I would definitely contemplate ordering it next time if I don’t decide not to start checking off sammies on the po’boy menu.

 

I ordered the shrimp&amp;grits because I dominated quite a few Blue Ribbons at Southland Ballroom the night before and was also looking for a spicy kick to my taste buds. I wasn’t too big of a fan of the Bloody Mary that I ordered. It was relatively small for $7 and nothing really to write home about. I think they have changed around the brunch menu from the one posted on their web site because I don’t recall any goat cheese in the dish and they raised the price of shrimp&amp;grits to $14 instead of the $12 that is posted online.

The shrimp&amp;grits were great. The shrimp didn’t have that rubbery texture that so many places serve these days due to overcooking them. They were crisp on the outside with a firm but not tough interior which in my mind is perfect. The grits were coarser than most of the local places that serve the dish and probably imported from NOLA as opposed to the less coarse stone-ground grits that are manufactured here. When all of that was covered in Chef Battistella’s“Holy Trinity sauce”, I think the gravy-like sauce won me over against some of the North Carolina and South Carolina style shrimp&amp;grits that are cream based which can be too rich for my taste buds.

Battistella’s just added a barbecue shrimp po’boy to the menu which might be the first sammy to be checked off followed quickly by the oyster po’boy. I also saw a variety of appetizers pass by our table like the fried jambalaya balls and fried green tomatoes that looked fantastic. If you haven’t noticed, fried food is my downfall. A couple sitting beside us were partaking in coffee and beignets which could be a nice romantic morning out with your significant other. The historic aspect of the building really gives it that French Quarter feel making the ambiance that much better.

 REVIEW: Jerry’s Grill–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on December 29, 2011 
 
 

Ever since moving to Raleigh, I have been on the lookout for a little hole-in-the-wall place that serves a good cheeseburger. I have tried what seem to be the two Raleigh favorites, Char-Grill and Snoopy’s, and thought they were okay but not what I was looking for. I was in search of a place similar to a place that served burgers like Corner Grill in High Point is one of my favorites. I finally made it to Jerry’s Grill near the intersection of Whitaker Mill&amp;Wake Forest in Raleigh after several recommendations from friends about one of the best lunches in Raleigh.

 

I ordered the #6 combo which is a cheeseburger, hot dog, fries&amp;a drink for about $6.75. My combo came with one of the regular red dogs with a steamed bun that are both cooked in their hot dog cooker. The burgers are thick and cooked a flattop grill so they have a nice crispness. The buns are lightly buttered and then toasted on the grill before they add the toppings. I suggest getting both the burgers and dogs all the way (chili, slaw, mustard, onion). The chili doesn’t overpower the taste of the burger and the slaw is soppy but not so much that it makes the bun soggy. The fries are the generic crinkle cut variety so they aren’t anything special but fries are always a great accompaniment to all the way burgers and dogs.

Jerry’s also serves breakfast all day (note: they close early at 2 p.m.) which looks delicious although I haven’t tried it with breakfast items like The Hobo, the Blue Rock Deluxe or their made from scratch biscuits. You can also order fried bologna sandwiches or daily specials like baked spaghetti or corndogs. You can also find a variety of different beverages ranging from Snapple to bottle Cokes but I haven’t tried anything but their sweet tea which is delicious.

The interior of Jerry’s Grill is a little tight especially when it gets busy. There is a small bar with five seats and two community tables plus two tables outside when the weather is nice. I love community tables at restaurants because it gives you the opportunity to talk with new people. If you feel like being reclusive, there will be a few newspapers from that day laying around that you can read.

I have been back to Jerry’s Grill about two or three times since my first visit and have the feeling that I will be turning into a regular there. Lunch at Jerry’s isn’t fast food but you can get in and out of there in about 3o to 35 minutes. I definitely think you should check it out and let us know what you think.

 REVIEW: Capital Club 16–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on September 5, 2011 
 Photo Credit: NewRaleigh.com 
I finally made it out to eat during a Downtown Raleigh Restaurant Week . I have been trying to do it for about two years now. I guess moving to Raleigh made it a little bit easier to do. I headed down to Capital Club 16 with some friends (Aaron, Brooks, Brock, Liz and Tyler) for dinner before we went out for some cocktails with some college friends at 42nd Street Oyster Bar.

Capital Club 16 was offering a $20 fixed price menu with a variety of options:

 FIRST COURSE (APPETIZER/SALAD–Choose One) 

 Butter Lettuce Wedge Slab (bacon, grape tomatoes, pickled red onions, and Sweet Bonnie’s Blue Cheese dressing) Shrimp Skewer (with sautéed spinach and crispy cheese grits cake served with smoked paprika aioli) 

 SECOND COURSE (ENTREE –Choose One ) 

 Summer Squash Mac and Cheese (our blend of Vermont white cheddar, Gouda and Jarlsberg; served with a side of market greens and fruit) Steak Frites (NY Strip Steak with handcut fries, cabernet mushroom demi sauce and basted egg) Red Drumfish (with smoked paprika and cauliflower potato gratin; petite local field green mix) 

 THIRD COURSE (DESSERT –Choose One ) 

 Dotchie’s Poundcake (with fresh berry or fudge sauce served a la mode) Apple Fritters (beer battered apple rings with vanilla sauce served a la mode) 

The bar menu was fantastic with a bunch of great beers and wine plus what I’ve heard are some of the best mixed cocktails downtown although I will have to try them next time because I stuck with beer.

 

The Butter Lettuce Wedge Slab was very simple. The pickled onions were nice and added some sour notes to the salad. The grape tomatoes were sparse and truthfully was just a grape tomato cut in half. I know it is a fixed price menu and the portions are smaller than usual but that is kind of ridic. The wedge was fresh and plentiful with a heaping amount of blue cheese dressing. The most impressive part of the salad was the bacon on top which seemed to be more pork belly than bacon because of the thickness. All in all, it was a good salad.

 

By the time that we got to Capital Club 16, they had run out of red drum and substituted it with tuna. I was a little disappointed but I love tuna about as much as I love drum. It came with the same smoked paprika and cauliflower potato gratin with a petite local field green mix on the side. They pan seared the tuna but I think they could have seared it at a higher temperature for a more well-done outside and more pink on the inside. The gratin was delicious although I don’t think it paired very well with the tuna. The salad was a nice addition to the dish (even though I didn’t plan on eating two salads) because the sweetness from the watermelon was a nice contrast to the heartiness of the tuna and gratin.

 

I am not normally a dessert guy but, since it was included, I went ahead and got the apple fritter and asked for six spoons so everyone could try a bite. I was blown away by the one bite that I had. They cut an apple into rings, covered the rings in a funnel cake-like batter and then dropped them in a deep fryer. The fried apple rings were extremely tender and sweet and were a hit at the table. It was a good palate cleanser for everyone’s meal.

I tried their skillet lobster mac‘n’cheese thanks to Brooks and a bite of griddled belly with sauerkraut from Capital Club 16′s“The Butcher’s Plate”thanks to Aaron. Everything we had was fantastic and I look forward to going back sometime soon. It is definitely a place that I would recommend for a casual dinner out on the town or just to hang out for the evening drinking anything from $1.50 Miller High Life to $9 Sir Walter Raleighs (Gin, Blood Orange Juice, triple sec, Absinthe with candied lemon).

 REVIEW: Chubby’s Tacos–Durham/Raleigh 

by Jamie Nunnelly on June 17, 2011 
 
 
 
Photo Credit: Tom B. on Yelp
 
I work at a nonprofit organization in RTP that is filled with postdocs, and grad students who are on a tight budget, and everyone has been telling me about Chubby’s Tacos . Recently, my husband bought a Groupon for Chubby’s, so I took the Groupon with me to work and decided to check it out. You can eat as cheaply as you’d like here. Tacos start at about $2 and the most expensive meal is about $10. In this day and age of recession, high gas prices and general tightening of the belt, this is a welcome surprise.

Chubby’s has several locations in Raleigh and Durham, but the one I ate at is off of Miami Boulevard near RTP, a mere 2.5 miles from where I work. When you first walk in, you see a large menu board and there’s a line you enter to order your food at the counter, much like a fast food restaurant. There are ample places to sit after you have ordered.

Actually, I had been to Chubby’s once before a few months ago and had the fish tacos. They were very inexpensive, but small, so I was left still feeling hungry. This time, I ordered the tofu and veggie burrito meal and was given a burrito that seemed like it could feed a small village! I could barely finish 1/2 of it! The wonderful surprise was that they used some decent vegetables in the burrito, including cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce and carrots along with a very generous portion of Mexican rice and nice, large pieces of tofu. The burrito was $6 with an added $2 for the meal, which included a side of Mexican rice, black beans and homemade tortilla chips. I was surprised by the great quality of the burrito and never expected to get freshly steamed vegetables in the burrito. Most of the time when you order a veggie burrito at a typical Mexican restaurant, you get refried beans, which are not at all healthy for you.  Using my $10 Groupon the meal was free and I actually had a little bit of money to spare.
 
This is just half of a tofu and veggie burrito from Chubby&apos;s
 
My friend, Katherine, also ordered a burrito, but she got one with chicken. The burrito was filled with chicken that has been slowly cooked and very tender. It was soaked in some kind of enchilada sauce. She said it was really tasty and very filling. She only finished a third of her burrito.
 
This is my&quot;to go&quot;burrito meal from Chubby&apos;s. Definitely enough for two meals!
 
Chubby’s has a great salsa bar, with several different types of salsa. I tried two of the medium spicy ones.  One was made with guacamole and had onions and just the right about of heat to make it interesting. The other was a great chunky salsa. I like to see the bits of onion, cilantro and tomato in my salsa, but it’s all about what you like. Chubby’s choices ranged from a more mild red salsa to a very hot habanero sauce.

 The menu touts many of the Mexican favorites including tacos, burritos, quesadillas,  nachos, taco salads, gorditas and tortas. Don’t expect many frills here, but the food is decent and as I’ve said, easy on the pocketbook. I look forward to going again soon to try a taco salad or a quesadilla.

 

Chubby’s is located at 2806 S Miami Blvd in Durham. They also have locations at 748 Ninth Street in Durham, 4711 Hope Valley Road in Durham, 10511 Shadowlawn Dr. in Raleigh and 2444 Wycliff Road in Raleigh. Maybe someday soon they will open a location in Chapel Hill as well? Many students and starving artists hope they will do so!

 REVIEW: The Shizzle Sauce 

by Charlie Brinson on March 15, 2011 
 
 

Get ready to add a new sauce to your grilling arsenal. The Shizzle is a Jamaican jerk-style marinade that is produced in Raleigh by chef Austin Williams under the name Big&amp;Fine Food Co., LLC. The primary ingredient in The Shizzle is a pineapple mash which is loaded with a precise blend of herbs, spices, garlic, and habanero peppers. The pineapples create a thick, sweet base for the jerk spices, and the flavor profile is unique compared with other similar jerk marinades. You can marinate any meat from pork loin, ribs, shrimp, turkey, fish, goat and wild game (venison, antelope, duck and gator have all been successfully Shizzled according to Austin). I am sure you could toss it on some tofu or other meat substitutes if you aren’t into the whole carnivore lifestyle.

I was in Raleigh for a wedding this past weekend and a few of my friends decided to get together for a cookout on Friday night. I had just gotten two samples of The Shizzle in the mail to review for Eat It, North Carolina so I started throwing together some ideas for what I should make. I was e-mailing back and forth with Austin, the chef/owner of The Shizzle, and he said that I should definitely grill some SHWINGs (grilled chicken wings marinated in The Shizzle). I had bagged about ten ducks (a mixture of the puddle and diving species) during the hunting season down near Arapahoe with my father and my dog, Waylon, and decided to prepare them in small strips for street tacos.

I marinated the duck strips for about 30 to 45 minutes in a diluted mixture of The Shizzle and olive oil (to help cook the duck a little better when I spread it all out in a tinfoil boat) and let it chill in the fridge before placing it on a pretty, hot charcoal grill because duck should be cooked quickly on high heat so the meat doesn’t dry out. I sliced up some onion and added it to the mix before grilling similar to how tacos al pastor are served at my local taqueria .

 

I don’t remember how long I kept them on the grill but I am guess-timating that it was about 8-11 minutes. I tossed the meat a few times throughout the process which dropped the heat a little when I removed the grill top. The Shizzle had reduced in the tinfoil boat and caramelized/charred at the bottom from the natural sugars in the marinade put the duck was perfect. It had a little bit of char on it but it didn’t dry out either.

 

I portioned out the meat onto some store-bought corn tortillas and then topped each taco off with a heap of cilantro and some chopped raw onion. In hindsight, I would have sliced some avocado&amp;radish and then squeezed some lime on top of the tacos but they were still delicious and every piece of duck was eaten. One of my friends said that he would have rather had flour tortillas which would have held up a little bit better but they are less traditional for street tacos. The Shizzled duck tacos ended up being pretty damn spicy since The Shizzle reduced in the tinfoil boat while directly cooking the duck.

Initially, I was planning on topping the tacos with a mango salsa (recipe below) but I couldn’t find a good looking mango.

 1 ripe mango, diced 2 green onion stalks, chopped 1 medium jalapeño, minced A few sprigs of cilantro, chopped 1/2 lime, juiced Salt and pepper to taste Austin recommends balancing the mango equally with diced tomatoes&amp;adding a hint of cumin 

 

 

The store had chicken wings on special so I scooped up a package to make some SHWINGs. I started marinating them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator 24 hours before I put them on the grill to allow The Shizzle’s Jamaican jerk flavor to permeate the meat. I wasn’t the only one who brought stuff to grill so I had to let someone else use the grill in between cooking the duck and the SHWINGs. Luckily, this was the prime time for cooking SHWINGs because the grill wasn’t blazing allowing me to cook the wings for a while (recommended) so they could gain a nice char and The Shizzle could caramelize on the chicken.

The wings didn’t turn out as spicy as the tacos probably because they were only coated from the marinade process instead of cooked in the sauce like the duck was and there was less residual habanero on them. I thought these things were absolutely delicious. We had already had a full dinner (duck taco appetizers and Big Erv’s grilled chicken plus sides for the meal) but people were still downing the SHWINGs left and right.

 

Austin told me that The Shizzle will be releasing a‘Voodoo Hot!’version of their jerk marinade this month which will use three times the amount of habanero peppers that they use in the original recipe. It made me cringe a little bit because I am a lightweight when it comes to heat. The heat of the original recipe wasn’t overly spicy for me but it did help me drink beers a little faster on Friday night. Luckily, it was a great beer, LoneRider Brewery’s Peacemaker pale ale out of Raleigh, as recommended by Austin to pair with The Shizzle. I have the feeling the‘Voodoo Hot!’would be too hot for me but I am a wimp. If you like spicy food, give The Shizzle‘Voodoo Hot!’a run for its money and let us know what you think.

Looking for a list of retail locations so you pick up The Shizzle on your next shopping trip? They are constantly updating the list on their Facebook page with current locations but you can also ask your local retailer to start carrying The Shizzle if they don’t have it on their shelves yet.

If you like a bit of spice in your life, you need to go pick up a jar of The Shizzle and start grilling with it today. I am going to have to go pick up another bottle to give the following recipe for Shizzled Shrimp&amp;Grits a try.

 Shizzled Shrimp&amp;Grits 

 Ingredients: 

 1 pound fresh shrimp, peeled 1 cup Carolina Grits (or grits of choice, stone-ground preferred) 1 cup of The Shizzle Jerk Marinade 2 cups water 2 cups milk 2 tbsp butter 1/4 cup creme of coconut (aka coconut cream, creme de coconut) 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 1 tbsp canola oil (or other cooking oil) Salt to taste 1 lemon wedge 

 Directions: 
Peel (if necessary) and rinse shrimp, then pat dry with a paper towel. Put shrimp in a bowl or zip-top bag, add The Shizzle Jerk Marinade, covering the shrimp thoroughly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. If marinating longer than 30 mins, bring up to to room temperature during last 30 minutes.

Combine grits, water, and milk in saucepan, add salt as desired, and bring to boil (slowly, to avoid scalding milk). Once boiling, continue to boil/simmer at low heat for 30-40 minutes, to desired texture. When done, remove from heat and stir in creme of coconut, butter, and salt if desired.

Heat a large sauté pan over med-high heat and add canola oil. Add the marinated shrimp and sauté, turning/tossing frequently, until shrimp turn pink and The Shizzle carmelizes nicely.

Pour grits into a large bowl, place shrimp on top, and garnish with cilantro. Squeeze lemon wedge over entire bowl.

 FOOD PORN: bu•ku brunch–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on December 18, 2010 
 
 

I haven’t had a chance to make it to bu•ku in Raleigh yet but I have been salivating over their Facebook updates for the past few months. bu•ku is a locally owned and operated bar and restaurant in downtown Raleigh that I have heard a lot of good stuff about. Their food is globally inspired street food from pushcarts and street vendors across every continent.

They posted a delicious looking photo album on Facebook with pictures from their brunch (Saturday&amp;Sunday–11 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and I thought I would share a few of them with you. I am hoping to make it down to bu•ku sometime in the next few months to give it a try. Let us know if you have been there recently and what you thought.

 REVIEW: Finch’s Family Restaurant–Raleigh 

by Charlie Brinson on November 5, 2010 
 
 
 Finch’s Restaurant is a little hole-in-the-wall joint in Raleigh located“inside the beltline”on Peace Street right off of Capital Blvd. The restaurant resides in an old school drive-in restaurant’s skeleton and has been there since 1945. Pollock and Chesson, my friends that took me here, told me that it has been a local hot spot for a cheap breakfast and a tasty meat&amp;two vegetables plate for a while.

We went on a Saturday morning around 10 a.m. before heading down to Greenville to watch East Carolina whip up on Marshall during a nice afternoon game. The restaurant was buzzing with people from all walks of life and everyone was in the mood to get a tasty breakfast.

One thing that stood out to me about Finch’s was their coffee cups. Unlike traditional breakfast places, the coffee cups were the kind that you would find in anyone’s kitchen. I have been told that locals bring in random coffee cups to add to the collection. My coffee cup was from The Weakest Link . It is a pretty cool idea because I could see someone eating there 20 times and never getting the same cup twice.
