* Sanibel and Captiva Islands Restaurant Guide *

 This Sanibel restaurant guide is based on our experiences with restaurants we&apos;ve tried while vacationing at our
beachfront condo in the White Sands building on 
Sanibel Island, Florida, near Ft. Myers.
Our condo is available for rent by the week, so please click here to get to that page for more information.

Though there are many tempting dining options on Sanibel and Captiva, what is most unique is an almost a total lack 
of chain restaurants. The only two you&apos;ll find on the Island are a Dairy Queen and a Subway. So have fun picking out your dining experiences without 
 going to the same old chain restaurants you go to back home!

 Some general notes about this guide: 
- Please recognize that the comments are based on the dining experiences of my family, and our tastes tend towards casual dining with kids, and our opinions are often times based on only one visit.
- Mileage given is from the White Sands condo to the restaurant. White Sands is in the middle of the island, very close to Tarpon Bay Road, so it is no more than 
6 miles driving to the lighthouse end of the Island and 8 miles driving to Blind Pass Bridge onto Captiva. On the beach near our condo is milepost 4.25, the distance to the 
lighthouse via the beach.

 Some general notes about Restaurants on Sanibel and Captiva: 
- Casual clothes are the rule for most of the Island&apos;s restaurants. Shorts, tee shirts and sandals are usually fine. 
 Only a couple require more than that, and are noted as such.
- Being a Gulf Coast Island, most restaurants offer a reasonable seafood menu even if they&apos;re not
 truly a seafood restauarant.
- Most of the restaurants that specialize in seafood offer a reasonable menu for the landlubbers.
- Many restaurants offer an &quot;Early Bird&quot; special, which is usually a menu of smaller lower priced 
meals that are offered only for diners seated by and early time, usually 6pm.
- Please check with a restaurant before going there to make sure they are open. Some 
 close on a particular day of the week, or in their off season, or just simply have 
 gone out of business.
- Florida law prohibits smoking in restaurants. Some of the following establishments may be considered bars and fall outside that regulation. Also, smoking is 
allowed outside, so if you choose to dine on a restaurant&apos;s outside patio or deck you may have a smoker nearby.

 
 Restaurants On Sanibel Island 
 
 Gramma Dots - This is one of the unique places you don&apos;t want to miss. This very casual restaurant is located in the middle 
 of the docks at the Sanibel Marina. The sides of the restaurant are just the screened walls separating you from the boats and water.
 Known for excellent seafood, but plenty of other good sandwiches as well. Sandwiches are served with their fresh made potato chips which you don&apos;t want to miss!
 It&apos;s a little tricky to find because from Periwinkle you turn down a residential sidestreet, so check a map before you go.
634 North Yachtsman Drive at the Sanibel Marina (239) 472-8138
 Doc Ford&apos;s - Atmosphere and some menu items are based on the Doc Ford books by author and now restaurant owner Randy Wayne White. He shows up occasionally for book signings.
 Food is very good, casual atmosphere and moderate prices. This is a regualr stop for us when we are on the island.
975 Rabbit Road, at Sanibel-Captiva Road. (239) 472-8311
 Lazy Flamingo - Good casual food with an emphasis on seafood. Two locations, one on Periwinkle and the other just before crossing to Captiva. The location on Sanibel is 
 unique in that it looks like an old ship. 1036 Periwinkle (239) 472-3969 (closest to the condo) and 6520-C Pine Avenue 
 (on San-Cap Rd. just before Captiva) (239)472-5353.
 Il Tesoro - Good authentic mediteranian style italian food in a casually elegant Tuscan atmosphere. Medium to higher prices. Dining room is rather small, so make a reservation. 
 At the opposite end of Tarpon Bay Road from the condo. (239) 395-4022
 The Timbers - Casual nautical atmosphere. Very good food and service with moderate prices.
 They&apos;re known for both fresh fish and steaks, and they have a large fresh catch menu each day. 
 The Timbers has been an island staple since 1978. They are owned by the same people that own Matzaluna&apos;s, Sanibel Grill, and 
 a few other Florida restaurants. There is covered parking under the restaurant with an elevator.
703 Tarpon Bay Rd., just past Periwinkle when driving from the condo (239) 472-3128

 food was very good, with a very large menu including many sandwiches, salads, seafood, BBQ as well as a 
 menuboard listing about a dozen types of fish available today, which you can have prepared a handful 
 of different ways with a variety of sides. The dining room is casual and colorful, but if the weather is good the better option is

 Restaurants On Captiva Island 
(it&apos;s about 7 miles from White Sands Condominium to the Blind Pass bridge leading onto Captiva, and 
then another four to five miles to most of the restaurants) 
 Bubble Room - The is the original Bubble Room that has been made famous for eclectic decor. They&apos;re noted for having a wide variety of desert cakes 
 that are served in huge slices. Don&apos;t miss out on walking through the restuarant to see all the unusual things on display.
Andy Rosse Lane, in the heart of Captiva, 12 miles from White Sands. (239) 472-5558
 The Mucky Duck - Opened in 1976, it is one of the oldest restaurants on the islands, 
and also one of the few that is truly on the beach and has good sunset views. People gather here for the sunset, so it gets crowded. 
Since they don&apos;t take reservations you should plan on coming well before or after the sunset crowd, or plan on a wait. Food is a 
little upscale, with dinner prices typically in the $18-$28 range.
11546 Andy Rosse Lane, Captiva, 12 miles from White Sands. (239) 472-3434.
 The Green Flash - Excellent food and great views of 
the bay from most seats in this elevated restaurant. The food was great, and most entrees are just under $20. It&apos;s
 just a bit dressier than most restaurants, so a nice shirt and shorts would be appropriate.
1/2 mile south of Andy Rosse Lane, 11.5 miles from White Sands. (239) 472-3337.
 The Old Captiva House at &apos;Tween Waters Inn - An old historic resort on Captiva. 
Sunset views and an upscale menu, and probably will need to dress up a bit for this one.
15951 Captiva Drive (the main road), 10.75 miles from White Sands (239) 472-5161
 Keylime Bistro - Festive decor and a wide menu.
11509 Andy Rosse Lane, in the heart of Captiva, 12 miles from White Sands. (239) 395-4000
 R.C. Otter&apos;s - Pass on this one. The food was marginal (we had problems with two dishes out of seven), the waitress was rude,
 and the atmosphere was bad. 11506 Andy Rosse Lane. (239) 395-1142.



 
 Out Island Restaurants 
With all the great restaurants on Sanibel/Captiva there&apos;s no reason to go to the mainland, 
but these are a bit different - you can only get to these with a boat, seaplane or swimfins since they are on nearby remote islands! 

 Cabbage Key - It is claimed that Jimmy Buffett&apos;s visit here inspired him to write his trademark song 
&quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot;. The Restaurant is extremely casual. The decor
 is marked by dollar bills are taped to the walls, a tradition started years ago by fishermen stopping in and leaving a little extra money 
 there so that they knew they have enough for a beer the next time they came back. Located at mile marker 60 on the Intracoastal Waterway. Click here for options on how to get here. We&apos;ve gotten there by renting a boat 
 from one of the Sanibel or Captiva marinas.
 Useppa Island Club - A hotel was first put on Useppa Island in the 
early 1900&apos;s and had a colorful history with the rich and famous, and even a role in WWII. Visited in the fall of 2007 and had an excellent lunch. 
To get there, take the channel between intra-coastal Waterway markers 64 and 65, or click here for other ways to get to the island. 
 Barnacle Phil&apos;s and Mangos are located on North Captiva Island, 
which is just north of Captiva. The restaurants are very casual. Located on Safety Harbor, a protected inlet with plenty of docking 
directly infront of the restaurants. The island&apos;s grass airstrip is an easy walk too.
